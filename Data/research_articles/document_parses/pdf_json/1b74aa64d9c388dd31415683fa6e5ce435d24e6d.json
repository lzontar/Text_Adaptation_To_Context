We set the threshold for poor potential at less than 10 events a Pharmaceutical or mechanical b Based on the IQR c Based on non-significant between-centre differences Previous studies also report large between-centre differences in processes of TBI care across Europe [24] [25] [26] . This between-centre variation could be explained by variation in adherence to guidelines. Although 89% of centres indicated that they complied with the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines, actual assessment of real-time practice may be different. For example, ICP monitoring in patients with severe TBI (GCS < 9) is one of the higher-level evidence recommendations in the BTF guidelines, but we only found adherence rates of 44-82% (IQR) across centres in our study. This implies that there is much to gain in the reduction of variation Fig. 1 Adjusted random effect estimates per centre for process indicators. This figure shows the between-centre differences for the process indicators (beware of different x-axes). Quality indicator definitions can be found in Additional file 3. On the y-axis, each dot represents a centre. A centre with an average indicator score has log odds 0 (a positive log odds indicates higher indicator scores and a negative log odds lower indicator scores). The between-centre differences are represented by the shape of the caterpillar plots; the variation in the log odds for individual centres and the corresponding confidence intervals (uncertainty). For example, the use of ICP monitoring shows large variation between centres with small confidence intervals, so there is high variation with low statistical uncertainty. While for use of low molecular weight heparin, the variation is large, but the statistical uncertainty is high as well (due to high adherence rates for most centres). The caterpillars were based on nonmissing data (after imputation). 'Use of Low Molecular Weight Heparin' reflects the indicator 'Number of patients that receive pharmaceutical prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins/ total number of TBI patients admitted to the ICU'. 'Surgery within 4 hours' reflects the indicator 'Median door-to-operation time for acute operation of SDH and EDH with surgical indication'. DVT deep venous thrombosis, EDH epidural hematoma, ICU intensive care unit, MOR median odds ratio, SDH subdural hematoma in evidence-based care processes. One previous study reported the performance of quality indicators in children with TBI [27] . Although their indicators differed from those in the current study, they found a lower variation in adherence rates (between 68% and 78%). Several registries already exist for general ICU [3, 5] -or trauma care [2, 4] . Some of the outcome indicators we tested are also used in current ICU registries but did not perform well in our study (decubitus ulcers and hypoglycemia). For example, in our study, the outcome score for decubitus ulcers approached 0%, while in Dutch hospitals, decubitus was found in around 6% of patients [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2167, "end": 2171, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2172, "end": 2176, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2177, "end": 2181, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4370, "end": 4374, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4565, "end": 4568, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 4569, "end": 4571, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 4588, "end": 4591, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 4592, "end": 4594, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 4905, "end": 4909, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2726, "end": 2732, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Table 2 Overview of indicator performance"}, {"text": "This study has several strengths.

A centre with an average indicator score has log odds 0 (a positive log odds indicates higher indicator scores and a negative log odds a lower indicator scores). Outcome indicator scores were adjusted for case-mix and 'statistical uncertainty' (variation by chance) by using a random effects logistic regression model. The MOR (median odds ratio) represents the between-centre variation: the higher the MOR, the larger the between-centre variation (a MOR equal to 1 reflects no variation). The confidence intervals represent the statistical uncertainty. The caterpillars were based on non-missing data (after imputation).

Second, the indicator scores were derived from the CENTER-TBI database, which includes a substantial number of patients with TBI across many ICUs. Indeed, this analysis provides the first opportunity to study indicator performance and between-centre variation in TBI management on a larger scale.

We defined feasibility as the completeness of the data, while other aspects of feasibility, such as accessibility, timeliness, and missing data at a centre level, could not be addressed [30] . Statistical uncertainty was reflected in the number of event rates, while also other aspects as intraand inter rater reliability of medical coders are important but could not be addressed. We decided not to test the construct (correlations between indicators) and criterion validity (association with outcome) of the final indicator set as these are hard to test [31] ; for construct validity, predetermined correlations between quality indicators are hard to find between different aspects of processes of care and often do not correlate with outcome; and for criterion validity, the case-mix adjustment would differ per quality indicator and even very complex models cannot adjust for all residual bias (unmeasured confounding).
