To reduce inflammation-induced lung injury due to the abundance of cytokines in COVID-19 patients, glucocorticoids are frequently used to treat severe and critically ill patients. Glucocorticoid usage as part of COVID-19 treatment regimens fluctuates from 14.9% to 58% [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 20 . However, the risk-benefit ratio for treatment with glucocorticoids is unclear, especially in hyperglycaemia patients. A recent study reported by researchers in Wuhan showed that systemic corticosteroid therapy has not shown significant benefits 29 . We believe that corticosteroids should not be routinely recommended for diabetic COVID-19 patients. These patients might not experience obvious cytokine storm, have weak immune responses and are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, especially considering the aggravating effects of glucocorticoids on hyperglycaemia; therefore, glucocorticoids should not be administered unless they are indicated for other reasons Accepted Article (e.g. refractory septic shock, rapid progression on imaging and overactivation of the human inflammatory response) 14 . Treatment for hyperglycaemia might be an important supportive treatment for these patients. However, given the similarities and differences between the clinical profiles of COVID-19 patients with secondary hyperglycaemia and those with diabetes, strategies for using glucocorticoids might differ and require extra caution.",

Third, as a retrospective study, the data in this study can provide a preliminary assessment of the clinical profiles and prognosis of diabetes and secondary hyperglycaemia patients with COVID-19.

However, there are differences between secondary hyperglycaemia and diabetes, secondary hyperglycaemia seems to be the clue of more severe inflammation reaction and multiple organs damage induced by virus who might require additional attention and different treatments. Clinicians should pay more attention to the blood glucose status of patients (even patients without a history of diabetes) with COVID-19, as it may be indicative of poor prognosis. We believe that our study provides evidence that blood glucose status should be viewed as a key metric in the development of an effective public health strategy to mitigate COVID-19 associated poor prognoses.

The estimated standardized prevalence rates of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in Chinese adults are 10.9% (95% CI, 10.4%-11.5%), and 6.9% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.3%) of the population had received a new diagnosis by glycemic biomarkers 18 . It is estimated that up to 50% of cases are undiagnosed based on a self-reported medical history of diabetes to make diagnosis, which might lead to underestimation of the prevalence ofdiabetes 19 . Given that the prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19 (5.3%) is similar to the results of the general population in epidemiological survey (4%) according to a self-reported diabetes history. We speculated that the susceptibility of COVID-19 was similar in diabetes and non-diabetes patients. The patients enrolled in our retrospective study were mainly severe and critical COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of diabetes was 21.1% based on a self-reported history of diabetes, yet it was up to 36.7% if the diagnosis was based on the 2009 American Diabetes Association standard 15 , which was higher than the prevalence reported in similar recent studies.

Our study indicated that diabetic COVID-19 patients (group 3) had higher levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, serum creatine and LDH, lower levels of lymphocytes and eosinophils, and higher levels of inflammatory markers such as sCRP, ferritin, D-dimer and FDP than the patients in the control group.
