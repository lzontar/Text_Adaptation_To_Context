The enterotoxin produced by these bacteria (SEB) acts as a superantigen thereby activating a large proportion of T cells leading to cytokine storm and severe lung injury. D9Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive ingredient found in Cannabis sativa, has been shown to act as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. In the current study, we investigated the effect of THC treatment on SEB-induced ARDS in mice. While exposure to SEB resulted in acute mortality, treatment with THC led to 100% survival of mice. THC treatment significantly suppressed the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-g and TNF-a. Additionally, THC elevated the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their associated cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-b. Moreover, THC caused induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). THC acted through CB2 receptor as pharmacological inhibitor of CB2 receptors blocked the anti-inflammatory effects. THC-treated mice showed significant alterations in the expression of miRNA (miRs) in the lung-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs). Specifically, THC caused downregulation of let7a-5p which targeted SOCS1 and downregulation of miR-34-5p which caused increased expression of FoxP3, NOS1, and CSF1R. Together, these data suggested that THC-mediated alterations in miR expression in the lungs may play a critical role in the induction of immunosuppressive Tregs and MDSCs as well as suppression of cytokine storm leading to attenuation of SEB-mediated lung injury.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are caused by a myriad of etiologies such as toxic inhalation, lung contusion, pancreatitis, pneumonia, sepsis, and trauma (Frutos-Vivar et al., 2006) . Incidence of ARDS in USA is 78.9 per 100,000 persons/year and the mortality rate is 38.5% (Rubenfeld et al., 2005; Rubenfeld and Herridge, 2007) . The ARDS incidence increases with age, being more robust and serious in older people (Rubenfeld et al., 2005) . ARDS is also triggered by Staphylococcus aureus and its enterotoxin, SEB. ARDS is a life-threatening complication of infection especially caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). SEB acts as a super-antigen by activating a large proportion of T cells expressing certain Vb-specific T cell receptors. Such an activation leads to release of massive amounts of cytokines (Mason et al., 1998) and consequent injury to various organs, including the lungs. ARDS remains difficult to treat and thus far, no pharmacological protocol is effective in modifying the course of this clinical disorder leading to significant morbidity and mortality (Rubenfeld and Herridge, 2007) . Thus, understanding the mechanisms and developing new treatment modalities against ARDS and cytokine storm is timely and critical. is one of at least 113 cannabinoids identified in cannabis plant. THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. THC acts as a ligand for two receptors, CB1 and CB2. While its psychoactive properties are attributed to its ability to activate CB1 expressed in the CNS, because CB2 receptors are primarily expressed on immune cells, THC also exerts significant immunosuppressive activity. There is growing evidence suggesting that THC can suppress inflammation though activation of CB2 through multiple pathways. These include: a) Switch from Th1 to Th2 (Yuan et al., 2002) , b) differentiation of Tregs (Hegde et al., 2008) , and c) induction of Myeloid-derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) (Sido et al., 2015b) . d) Induction of apoptosis in activated T cells and dendritic cells (McKallip et al., 2002; Rieder et al., 2010) .",

Second and third doses of THC were given i.p. at 10 mg/kg after 24 and 48 h after the first dose of THC. THC dose used is relevant to pharmacological use in humans to treat cancer patients to prevent nausea and develop appetite. For example, THC dose of 20 mg/kg in mice translates to 60 mg/m 2 , based on body surface area normalization, and in patients, THC has been recommended for a maximum dose of 90 mg/m 2 /day, as also described in our previous work (Rao et al., 2015) .

Cells, after washing with cold PBS twice, were layered carefully onto Ficoll-Histopaque \u00ae -1077 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at a 1:1 ratio. MNCs were separated by density gradient centrifugation as described previously (Rieder et al., 2012) and enumerated by Trypan blue exclusion. To determine the phenotypical characteristics of the infiltrating cells, MNCs were stained with the fluorescent conjugated antibodies Phycoerthyrin (PE)conjugated anti-CD4 (clone: GK 1.5), (BV510)-conjugated anti-Gr-1 (RB6-8c5), (Alexa floura700)-conjugated anti-CD11b (clone: M1/70) from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA). Intracellular staining of Foxp3 was carried out using Biolegend's Foxp3 Fix/ Perm buffer set following manufacturer's instructions and using anti-foxp3 Alexa floura 488 (clone MF-14) from Biolegend. The isotype controls were used as negative controls. The stained cells were analyzed using BD Celesta flow Cytometry and DIVA software. In addition, we also performed histopathology of lungs by using H&E staining as described (Rao et al., 2015) .",

In brief, total RNA from purified lung MNCs was isolated using miRAeasy Mini kit and following the protocol of the company (Qiagen). In brief, single strand cDNAs were synthesized in a thermal cycler incubating the reaction mix (total RNAs and cDNA reagents) for 60 min at 25\u00b0C, 60 min at 42\u00b0C, and then at 4\u00b0C. Next, second strand cDNAs were synthesized from firststranded cDNAs to generate double-stranded cDNAs. Complementary RNAs (cRNAs) were synthesized according to Eberwine method (Van Gelder et al., 1990) using T7 RNA polymerase to in vitro transcription (IVT) of second-stranded cDNA into cRNA by incubating the IVT master mix with second-stranded cDNA for 16 h at 40\u00b0C. Magnetic microbeads (Affymetrix, USA) were used to purify the cRNAs. Purified cRNAs (15 \u00b5g) was used to synthesize second cycle of ss-cDNA by the reverse transcription of cRNA using 2 nd -cycle primers. The remaining cRNAs were removed using RNase H. Microbeads-purified ss-cDNA was fragmented by uracil-DNA glycosylase and using purinic/pyrimidinic endonuclease 1 at the unnatural dUTP residues to break the DNA strand. The fragmented ss-cDNAs were then labeled using labeling master mix just before the hybridization process. Hybridization master mix (contains fragmented and labeled ss-cDNAs) was first loaded into ClariomD chip (Affymetrix, USA) and then the GeneChip was incubated in Hybridization Oven 645 (Affymetrix, USA) for 16 h at 45\u00b0C with rotation at speed of 60 rpm. Next, GeneChip Hybridization Wash and Stain kit (Affymetrix, USA) was used to wash and stain the chips containing hybridized ss-cDNA at RT by using GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, USA) for about 2 h. Once the staining and washings were done, the chips were scanned using GeneChip Scanner (Affymetrix, USA) and the obtained raw data was analyzed using Transcriptome analysis console (TAC) to determine the expression of genes in MNCs.",

In contrast, SEB + THC group had attenuated lung injury as evidenced by decreased cell infiltration and damage to lung architecture. The lungs from mice treated with THC alone showed no significant changes when compared to na\u00efve or vehicle-treated mice. The mice exposed to dual dose of SEB and treated with vehicle (SEB + Veh) succumbed to death within 72-120 h post-exposure, but 100% of SEB-exposed mice treated with THC (SEB + THC) survived ( Figure 1B) , consistent with our previous studies (Rao et al., 2015) . Enumeration of MNCs infiltrating the lungs showed that SEB + Veh group had significant increase in such cells when compared to na\u00efve, or THC alone group, while SEB + THC group showed significant reduction in MNCs (Figure1C). Upon analysis of lung functions using plethysmography, SEB + Veh exposure caused a significant increase in the sRaw and dT due to the obstruction in the airway, while this effect was reversed in mice treated with SEB + THC ( Figure 1D ). Moreover, SEB + Veh-treated mice recorded a significant decrease in sGaw and PEF, while THC treatment led to reversal of these effects ( Figure 1D ). All pulmonary functions listed above were also evaluated 40 days post-SEB exposure in the survival group (SEB + THC) and compared with na\u00efve mice of the same age. The results of pulmonary functions showed that the survival group had normal pulmonary functional similar to na\u00efve mice ( Figure 1E) . , was evaluated in mice that survived after SEB + THC for 40 days when compared to na\u00efve mice.

Therefore, we examined the generation of key cytokines (IFN-g, TNF-a, TGF-b, IL-10, and M-CSF) in BALF isolated from mice that were exposed to SEB + Veh or SEB + THC. The data showed that inflammatory cytokines, IFN-g and TNF-a were upregulated in mice exposed to SEB + Veh, when compared to na\u00efve mice (Figures 2A, B) , but significantly decreased in mice treated with SEB + THC (Figures 2A, B) . Upon analysis of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-b and IL-10), we noted significant decrease in both TGF-b and IL-10 in BALF of SEB + Veh-exposed mice, when compared to na\u00efve mice ( Figures 2C, E) . However, THC treatment significantly increased the levels of TGF-b and IL-10 in BALF of SEB-treated mice ( Figures 2C, E) . We also noted that SEB + Veh-treated group had significantly lower levels of M-CSF while treatment with THC caused marked increase in M-CSF. Next, we examined the presence of various immune cell subsets in the lung infiltrating MNCs. To this end, we stained MNCs with various fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies to detect regulatory T cells (Treg: CD4+/FoxP3+) and Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs: CD11b+/Gr-1+ cells) and analyzed using a Flow Cytometer. These data showed that mice exposed to SEB + THC had significantly more percentages of Tregs ( Figure  2F ) and MDSCs ( Figure 2G ) in lung infiltrating MNCs, when compared to SEB + Veh group ( Figures 2F, G) . Data taken together suggested that THC treatment promoted the generation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-b and IL-10) and immunosuppressive cells (Treg and MDSCs) while significantly suppressing the generation of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-g and TNF-a).",

            "text": "Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) is produced by grampositive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, which is ubiquitous that adversely affects about one-third of the general population worldwide. It is responsible for staphylococcal food poisoning in humans and has been produced by some countries as a biological weapon (Wu et al., 2019) . SEB acts as a super antigen as it activates a large number of T cells such as those expressing Vb8, triggering cytokine storm, acute toxic shock, and multi-organ failure leading to mortality (Krakauer et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017) . SEB is also known to cause ARDS. Previous studies from our lab have shown that dual dose administration of minute doses of SEB into C3H/HeJ mice caused severe lung injury and mortality through the expansion of T lymphocytes and massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-g, while treatment with THC rescued these mice from SEB-mediated toxicity (Rao et al., 2015) . While it is difficult to treat SEBmediated toxicity, elegant studies demonstrated that short peptide mimetics of a conserved superantigen domain that activates T cells can block cytokines and prevent SEB-induced mortality in mice (Arad et al., 2000) . Additionally, SEB must bind directly into the dimer interface of CD28, and also its coligand B7-2, to trigger T-cell hyperactivation. Thus, preventing access of SEB to CD28 or B7-2 has also been shown to block lethality (Arad et al., 2011; Levy et al., 2016) .",

In the current study, we tested to see if treatment with THC after exposure to SEB was also effective and we noted that it was indeed able to reverse the toxicity of SEB thereby providing translational significance. While in the previous study, we noted that SEB induced miRNA-18a, which targeted Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog), an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby suppressing the induction of Tregs, THC treatment inhibited miRNA-18a thereby reversing the effects of SEB (Rao et al., 2015) . Because THC is known to trigger multiple pathways to suppress inflammation, we investigated additional mechanisms involving miRs that may target immunosuppressive cells such as MDSCs. Our results showed that THC induced both MDSCs and Tregs and that their induction correlated with downregulation of miR-let-71-5p and miR-34a-5p, which targeted key molecules such as NOS1, FoxP3, CSF1R, and SOCS1.",

            "text": "In the current study, we observed that THC suppressed SEBinduced inflammation and improved the pulmonary functions of the lung which was associated with activation and recruitment of Tregs and MDSCs to the site of inflammation ( Figure 1A) . One of the drawbacks of using THC in patients with ARDS is that it is psychoactive because of its ability to activate CB1 receptors in the brain. Interestingly, in the current study, we noted that THCmediated effect on ARDS was regulated, at least in part, through CB2 receptor, inasmuch as blocking CB2 with a CB2 antagonist (SR 144) decreased the ability of THC to induce MDSCs and Treg as well anti-inflammatory cytokines ( Figures 3A, B) . Because CB2 select agonists do not exhibit psychoactive properties, they may be better suited to treat ARDS in patients. However, in-depth studies on their use in vivo need further evaluation. THC has been shown to mediate potent anti-inflammatory properties through multiple pathways which include recruitment of MDSCs and regulatory T cells (Nagarkatti et al., 2009; Hegde et al., 2010; Sido et al., 2015a) . Previous studies from our lab showed that the anti-inflammatory properties of THC was mediated at least in part through induction of MDSCs and a significant increase in GCSF which recruits MDSCs (Hegde et al., 2008) . The role of cannabinoid receptor involvement in our ARDS model, is consistent with the observation that CB1 and CB2 receptors are expressed in the lungs and the bronchial tissue (Turcotte et al., 2016) . Also, endocannabinoids may play a role in suppressing inflammation during ARDS as suggested by the observation that increases in endocannabinoid, 2-Arachidonoylglycerol, triggers anti-inflammatory effects in a murine model of LPS-induced ARDS (Costola-de-Souza et al., 2013) . Several studies from our lab and others have characterized MDSCs as potent immunosuppressive cells (Gabrilovich et al., 2001; Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009 ) MDSCs may also be induced at sites of inflammation and may prevent tissue injury by downregulating inflammatory T cell responses (Bronte, 2009) . Cauley et al. showed that repeated systemic administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEB) led to induction of tolerance via accumulation of MDSCs in the spleen (Cauley et al., 2000) . We have recently also shown that THC attenuated chronic colitis in IL-10 knockout mice through MDSCs induction (Singh et al., 2012) . Rieder et al. demonstrated that THC-induced immunosuppressive MDSCs play a critical role in suppressing lung-injury (Rieder et al., 2012) . There are studies that have shown the role of MDSCs in the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-12, and IFN-g (Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009) .",

            "text": "Similar to MDSCs, the role of Tregs in suppressing inflammation has been well established. In this study, we observed that THC promoted generation of Tregs ( Figure 2F ) and associated cytokines such as IL-10 ( Figure 2D ) and TGF-b ( Figure 2C ) in lung infiltrating MNCs. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that THC-mediated induction of Tregs attenuates ConA-induced liver injury in mice (Hegde et al., 2008) . In another study involving colitis, it was shown that activation of CB2 by JTE907 promotes the differentiation of Th0 cells into the Treg cell phenotype, which was characterized by the expression of FoxP3, TGF-b, and IL-10 (Gentili et al., 2019) . Tregs are known to mediate their immunosuppressive functions through release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-b (Huang et al., 2006) . In this study, we also observed upregulated expression of IL-10 in lung infiltrating MNCs ( Figure 2D ). It should be noted that chronic inflammatory reactions induced by a variety of stimuli can trigger fibrosis involving scarring of tissues which is attributed to excess deposition of extracellular matrix components including collagen (Wynn, 2008) . Studies in both humans and animal models strongly suggest that TGF-b plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis . Thus, while in acute inflammatory reactions, TGF-b may play immunosuppressive role, during chronic inflammation leading to fibrosis of lungs, TGF-b may play a negative role. However, because our model involves acute inflammation, it is likely that TGF-b induced by THC may play a protective role in preventing ARDS.",

            "text": "Many studies have been shown that miRs play a major role in the regulation of gene expression and the immune responses (Arora et al., 2017) , including autoimmunity and inflammation (Singh et al., 2015) . We and others have shown previously that miRs play a critical role in promoting anti-inflammatory functions and immune suppression (Singh et al., 2015) (Zhou et al., 2014) (Kadhim et al., 2018) (Guan et al., 2016) . In the current study, therefore, we investigated if treatment with THC following SEB injection would alter the expression of miRs in lung immune cells. In this study, we observed that THC caused altered expression of a large number of miRs in lung infiltrating MNCs of mice exposed to SEB, when compared to mice treated with vehicle ( Figure 4D) . Upon pathway analysis of miRs using IPA, we identified two downregulated miRs (miR-let-71-5p and miR-34a-5p) in MNCs that may play significant role in THC-induced immune suppression. MiR-let-7a-5p showed strong binding affinity with complementary sequences of 3\u2032UTR regions of SOCS1 gene whereas miR-34a-5p showed strong binding affinity with NOS1, FoxP3, and CSF1R genes. Because THC downregulated the expression of miR-let-7a-5p and miR-34a-5p, these data suggested that this effect was responsible for increased expression of SOCS1, NOS1, FoxP3, and CAF1R in the MNCs. The role of miR-34a-5p to regulate the expression of NOS1, FoxP3, and CSF1R was further confirmed by performing transfection experiments and qRT-PCR (Figure 7) . There was significant downregulation of NOS1, FoxP3, and CSF1R expression in splenocytes that were transfected with miR-34a-5p mimic while the expression of NOS1, FoxP3, and CSF1R was significantly upregulated in splenic cells that were transfected with anti-miR-34a-5p inhibitor. NOS1 is a neuronal isozyme known to promote inflammation. However, NOS1 can metabolize arginine to produce nitric oxide. Arginine is an essential metabolite for T cells and thus, NOS1 can deprive T cells of arginine thereby suppressing proinflammatory T cells (Rodriguez et al., 2017) . In fact, MDSCs use such a mechanism involving direct deprivation of arginine. MDSCs have been shown to express CSFR1 (Lee et al., 2019) , also known as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR). In addition, activation of CSFR1 is involved in the differentiation of immunosuppressive macrophages (Bonelli et al., 2018) .",

Our data that FoxP3 is induced by THC in SEB model is consistent with previously published studies in models such as Graft-vs-Host disease and experimental model of Multiple Sclerosis (Pandey et al., 2011; Al-Ghezi et al., 2019b) . In the previous study involving treatment with THC prior to SEB injection, we found that THC downregulated miRNA-18a, which targeted Pten, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby inducing T-regulatory cells (Rao et al., 2015) . In the current study involving post-SEB treatment with THC, we identified yet another miR (miR-34a-5p) that may target FoxP3 directly and thereby lead to induction of Tregs. SOCS1 is a negative regulator of cytokine signaling. Thus, it suppresses the induction of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, SOCS1 maintains the stability of Tregs and prevents their plasticity to differentiate into inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cells when exposed to inflammatory cytokines (Ilangumaran et al., 2017) . Thus, the induction of NOS1, FoxP3, CSF1R, and SOCS1 by THC following downregulation of miR-34a-5p and miR-let-7a-5p, may lead to activation of a wide array of immunosuppressive pathways involving cytokines, Tregs, MDSCs, and macrophages.",

Because SEB is a super antigen that drives cytokine storm, our studies suggest that THC is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that has the potential to be used as a therapeutic modality to treat SEB-induced ARDS. This study also suggests that THC may mediate its effects through downregulating the expression of miR-let-7a-5p and miR-34a-5p that target the expression of SOCS1, NOS1, FoxP3, and CSF1R and consequently trigger immunosuppressive MDSCs and Treg as well as directly suppress inflammatory cytokines, leading to attenuation of SEB-induced ARDS in mice.",
