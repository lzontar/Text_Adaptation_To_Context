It takes empirical data from an on-site survey of 108 operating plants in Maharashtra to formulate objectives and decision-making metrics for the agent-based model and simulates possible future portfolio mixes. The studied decision drivers were capital costs, operating costs (including fuel consumption), a combination of capital and operating costs, and net present value. Where investors used a weighted combination of capital cost and operating costs, a natural gas uptake of~12PJ was obtained and the highest cumulative emissions reduction was obtained, 2 Mt CO 2 in the period from 2020 to 2050. Conversely if net present value alone is used, cumulative emissions reduction in the same period was lower, 1.6 Mt CO 2 , and the cumulative uptake of natural gas was equal to 15PJ. Results show how the differing upfront investment cost of the technology options could cause prevalence of high-carbon fuels, particularly heavy fuel oil, in the final mix. Results also represent the unique heterogeneity of fuel-switching industrial investors with distinct investment goals and limited foresight on costs. The perception of high capital expenditures for decarbonisation represents a significant barrier to the energy transition in industry and should be addressed via effective policy making (e.g. carbon policy/price).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "\u2022 Agent-based integrated assessment framework to assess industry fuelswitching.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "\u2022 Fuel-switching assessment including 4 investment metrics and 5 comparable scenarios.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "\u2022 Partial-equilibrium agent-based scenarios of an evolving socio-technical system.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "\u2022 Partial-equilibrium agent interactions produce non-smooth gas uptake patterns.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Industry accounts for approximately 40% of global total final energy consumption (160 EJ per year) and 23% (8 Gt CO 2 ) of global greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel use [1] .

The proposed approach combines a rich description of real technologies as obtained from the survey with demographic and socio-economic heterogeneity leading to specific investment strategies.

While fuel-switching is included with technological detail, the industry sector was analysed without a characterisation of the investors' motivations. The European energy model PRIMES formulates 31 industrial sub-sectors separately [10] . Although the model captures engineering and micro-and macro-economic interactions together with high level of detail, PRIMES assumes that investments are driven by profit or welfare maximisation assuming a perfect foresight over a short time horizon for demand sectors. The National Energy-Economic Modelling System NEMS includes a technology-rich submodule where new investments are simulated using a top-down econometric approach [11] . The industry sector in UKTM also includes a detailed sectoral representation and characterisation of technologies, but their uptake is exclusively dictated by a system-wide intertemporal cost minimisation with perfect foresight [12] .

Research has identified that the factors that influence investment behaviours in the industry sector are not only driven by objective technoeconomic facts but also by subjective factors that range from fuel costs to environmental values [13] . To advance the understanding of the factors behind enterprises' investment and decision-making, energy modellers need to explore the actual investment metrics that trigger fuel-switching investment in carbon-intensive industrial processes. Agent based modelling (ABM) can overcome barriers when modelling real investment behaviour in the industrial sector. ABM allows energy modellers to simulate the complex interactions of a number of heterogeneous agents and decision-makers within the larger complex system of the energy market. These interactions are driven by prescribed investment rules. Decision-makers include investors, policy makers, enterprises, and the energy market is comprised of many prices, policies and competitors. The potential application of ABM is that at the macrolevel, the characteristics of the complex systems occur when the behaviour of individuals at the micro-level is aggregated. ABM avoids treating different heterogeneous agents as a single entity that follow a single objective, e.g. lowest cost [14] . This enables the investment objectives(s), attributes and decision-making methodology of each agent to be taken into account. Thus, each agent acts based on its own governing rules, depending on the current situation of its decisionmaking environment [15] . Therefore, to understand the emerging properties of interacting agents, modellers must systematically define agents based on empirical data.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1416, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1674, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Agent-based modelling of the industrial sector"}, {"text": "Agent-based models (ABMs) offer an alternative perspective to the standard equilibrium IAMs (listed at the beginning of section 2).

These models represent real agent's heterogeneity and their interactions, and as a result of these the emergence of aggregate properties [20] . However, in most existing sector-specific IAMs, the representation of industrial processes is rather simplified and involves only capital and fixed costs of production. The technology details of production processes are usually not accounted for and the decisionmaking criteria is not extensively established for the representation of heterogeneous agents [21] . Nonetheless, it has been argued that Agentbased Integrated Assessment Models (AB-IAMs) approach can better assess the dynamics of technology adoption that follow a greener growth path [22] , and that emergence of these approaches shows that a new generation of agent-based integrated-assessment models have blossomed in recent years [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 505, "end": 509, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 605, "end": 609, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 783, "end": 787, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 993, "end": 997, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1141, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1504, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1695, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1844, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 614, "end": 621, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Agent-based modelling of the industrial sector"}, {"text": "The main contributions to ABM modelling are mainly sector-specific, as described in Table 1 , which includes engineering detail and highlight the interdependences among agents as key parameters establishing the dynamics of technology adoption or fuel-switching.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 84, "end": 91, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Agent-based modelling of the industrial sector"}, {"text": "Prior work has documented the effectiveness of agent-based modelling at improving the representation of decision-making motivations of heterogeneous agents (see Table 1 ).

The OPEX and CAPEX-OPEX-based scenarios, favour petcoke and coal respectively for the fuel availability at lower costs. An important observation is that a fuel consumption reduction can be observed in OPEXbased and CAPEX-OPEX-based scenarios comparing with the NO-GAS-based scenario. Fig. D.2 reports the air quality analysis for steel industries using kilns. In the CAPEX-based scenario, an approximated 30% CO 2 emissions reduction is observed due to the natural gas uptake in the new fuel mix compared with the NO-GAS-based scenario. A striking observation is appreciated in the NPV-based scenario where HFO is dominant. Here, NO x emissions increases approximately 50% in the next three decades. D2. Furnaces   Fig. D.3 reports a set of results for furnaces using six different fuels in the iron-steel sub-sector. Coal and carbon black feedstock increases in the NO-GAS-based scenario. CAPEX-based and CAPEX-OPEX-based scenarios favours a greater penetration of natural gas while OPEX-based scenario favours LPG. The NPV-based scenario also favours natural gas but in a lower proportion compared with CAPEX-based and CAPEX-OPEX-based scenarios. Overall, there is a fuel consumption reduction in all scenarios except CAPEX comparing with the NO-GAS-based scenario.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 160, "end": 168, "text": "Fig. D.1", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 809, "end": 817, "text": "Fig. D.2", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1248, "text": "Furnaces   Fig. D.3", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "D1.
