The proposed architecture is made up of four stratum: (1) Device layer consists of IoMT devices and implements the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) [9] key establishment protocol and the identity-based credential (IBC) mechanism to provide decentralized privacy, (2) Facility layer for managing IoMT devices and providing unique identity based on their attributes, (3) Cloud layer that runs anonymization algorithms to allow an identity-free data analysis and storage, and (4) Cluster layer groups several entities including medical facilities, service providers, and cloud servers into clusters.

It is not implemented and not evaluated. In [4] and [19] , a blockchain-based architecture is proposed to allow secure transmission and storage of large amount of sensitive data generated by IoMT. Table 1 presents a classification of the existing contributions having integrated blockchain to IoMT (NM means Not Mentioned). Most of the proposed solutions are private blockchain-based and used Ethereum infrastructure thanks to its flexibility that is offered by the implementation of smart contracts for management purposes. Many issues have been treated when integrating blockchain with IoMT. For storing the big IoMT data, most of works [3] proposed an off-chain storage: Some researches [7, 12] proposed to use IPFS because of its distributed data structure. Other works [3, 5, 9, 17, 20] used the cloud computing to store encrypted data while keeping hash references of that data in the blockchain. Such solutions do not guarantee immutability which is the essential feature of blockchain. In fact, if data have been modified/altered, this will be detected thanks to their hash stored in the blockchain but not recovered as it is only stored in the cloud (centralized storage). Other studies proposed an on-chain storage without precising technical details about dealing with the huge amount of data streams generated by IoMT devices. In the other hand, healthcare applications require real time responses which require a fast consensus protocol. However, IoMT are constrained devices and produce huge amount of data. The majority of studied works [9] have eliminated the consensus protocol to meet IoMT requirements. Some authors [12] use smart contract to self-verify and self-execute transactions. These smart contracts are protected using a lightweight consensus mechanism. Some others [6] proposed a lightweight consensus protocol: Researchers in [12, 20] modified the PoS protocol to adapt it to the IoMT requirements, other works [5, 20] grouped the nodes in clusters and chose a header for each cluster to manage transactions between nodes, validate and create the blocks. For security requirements in healthcare domain, some existing works proposed solutions to manage and control access rights. The majority [3, 9, 12, 13] implement smart contracts to allow access to only authorized users based on some attributes of the IoMT ecosystem and their interaction with the users/stakeholders. Some other works [5, 14, 20] focused on maintaining patient privacy by proposing a lightweight privacy-preserving algorithms like ring signature scheme.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 6, "end": 10, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 307, "end": 310, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 978, "end": 981, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 986, "end": 990, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1576, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1624, "end": 1627, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1628, "end": 1631, "text": "12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1711, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1714, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1717, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1718, "end": 1721, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1725, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2486, "end": 2489, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2569, "end": 2573, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2731, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2794, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2795, "end": 2798, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2875, "end": 2878, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2879, "end": 2882, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3156, "end": 3159, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3160, "end": 3162, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3163, "end": 3166, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3167, "end": 3170, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3353, "end": 3356, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3357, "end": 3360, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3361, "end": 3364, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1131, "end": 1138, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "General Blockchain Concept Without Technical Specifications"}, {"text": "The literature review shows that there are some significant research gaps.
