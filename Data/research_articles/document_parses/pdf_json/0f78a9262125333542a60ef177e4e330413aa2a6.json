Since students have left a large amount of online learning data, it provides an effective way to predict students' academic performance and enable pre-intervention for at-risk students. Current data sources used to predict students' performance are limited to data just from the corresponding learning platform, from which only learning behaviors on that course can be observed. However, students' academic performance will be related to other behavioral factors, especially the patterns of using Internet. In this paper, we utilize two types of datasets from 505 university students, i.e., online learning records for a project-based course, and network logs of university campus network. A deep learning framework: Sequential Prediction based on Deep Network (SPDN) is proposed to predict students' performance in the course. SPDN models students' online behavioral sequences by utilizing multi-source fusion CNN technique, and incorporates static information based on bidirectional LSTM. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPDN model outperforms the baselines and has a significant improvement on early-warning.

Both users' online behaviors which can be clustered into several distinct pattern [14] and students' static information [5] have impacts on the academic performance prediction. In this study, two types of data are collected from 505 anonymous students to predict at-risk students in a university project-based course. One dataset records the students' online learning activities of the course which provides a learning platform for self-study.

The current methods of EDM are generally divided into two categories. The first traditional method relies on machine learning methods for binary classification prediction. In [1, 3, 4, 13] , each machine learning model considers different types of predictive features extracted from raw online learning activity records to predict whether students can graduate on time. Also generalized linear model is used to predict students' dropout by extracting features from the original learning website log files such as page click rate, forums and so on [2, 10] . The second emerging approach involves the exploration of neural networks (NN). Because deep learning achieves better performance than traditional machine learning in many respects, work has been done to predict students' dropout in MOOC through deep neural network (DNN) models [10] and recurrent neural network (RNN) models [6] . Different from all current methods which still rely on feature engineering to reduce the input dimension and limit the development of larger NN models, Kim et al. [11] propose GritNet which extracts the original learning behavior sequence from network log as raw input of the RNN model.

It illustrates that cluster1 and cluster 2 have low at-risk rate and high proportion, while nearly a quarter of the student in cluster 3 and cluster 4 are at-risk. Specifically, Fig. 1 illustrates the proportion of occurrence frequency of each activity in different clustering patterns. The proportion is calculated by the frequency of the particular activity divided by the count of all activities for each case. And in each cluster, we calculated the average of the above proportions across all the cases which are assigned to the particular cluster. In the x-axis, we list different actions of original internet access activities and online learning activities. It can be seen that there are obvious differences between clusters. The overall access internet frequency of students in cluster 1 is very low, so they may prefer offline learning. Students in Cluster 2 often use search engines, which may be related to learning. Conversely, Cluster 3's students prefer to watch videos and use life tool applications which may not be educational. On the learning website, they ask and answer questions in the forum relatively frequently, but there are few viewing actions. Cluster 4 has the fewest numbers, but is extremely focused on online games and rarely involves other types of online activities. On the learning website, their learning behavior is relatively inactive, which may also be the reason why the student's at-risk rate is high in the cluster. In addition, students experiment in a group and always learn together in a group. So students in the same group will have a high probability of having the same academic status and the grouping information has important impact on prediction.
