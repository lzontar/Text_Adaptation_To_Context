We assessed whether RPP decreases antibiotic days of therapy and length of hospital stay for pediatric patients with acute respiratory infections. In the inpatient population, patients testing positive with RPP were given fewer antibiotic days of therapy (2.99 vs 4.30 days; P = .032) and had shorter hospital stays (2.84 vs 3.80 days; P = .055) than patients testing negative. In the ED population, patients testing positive with RPP received fewer discharge prescriptions for antibiotics than patients not tested (8.8% vs 41.1%; P < .001). RPP use was more prevalent in admitted patients than in ED patients (78.9% vs 7.3%; P < .001). Our results suggest that RPP testing curbs antibiotic use and decreases length of hospital stay.",

A recent study 9 discovered that point-of-care viral PCR testing in pediatric ED patients has the potential to curb inappropriate use of antibiotics, reduce the cost of patient hospital visits, and decrease time spent in the ED. These benefits can occur only if the cost of RPP is manageable, and its use will help decrease antibiotic use in the ED.",

We believe that respiratory viral testing is effective for helping guide clinical judgment regarding antibiotic use and also the duration of hospitalization. Because inpatient RPP use is significantly more prevalent than ED use, future research should identify current barriers to administering RPP tests in the ED, one of which is likely the cost of the test.",
