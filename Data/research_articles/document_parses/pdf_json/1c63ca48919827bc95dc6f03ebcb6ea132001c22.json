Vaccination requirements for the solitary indoor cat are very different than those for feral or freeroaming cats. Core vaccines include those directed against feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus, and feline caliciviruses. Other important vaccines include the mandated rabies vaccination and also vaccination against feline leukemia. One significant issue with respect to feline vaccination is the development of injection site sarcomas. Although the prevalence of these is low and should not inhibit the use of vaccines, they are impossible to predict and very difficult to treat.",

In general, healthy cats should be vaccinated but mild concurrent illness may not be disqualifying. Issues such as immunosuppression by feline retroviruses, other immunodeficiencies, nutritional status, and chronic stress must be considered. The age of the cat is critical considering the persistent effects that maternal antibodies have on early vaccination, whereas old age presents other significant issues. The other key issue is, of course, lifestyle. The opportunities that a cat has to encounter other infected cats will vary greatly ranging from the housebound pet, to cats in shelters, to feral cat populations.",

For unknown reasons, this risk was greater in neutered than in sexually intact cats. Lethargy was the most commonly reported event followed by pain or swelling at the injection site, vomiting, facial edema, and pruritus ( Fig. 14.1 ). The number of adverse events increased significantly when multiple vaccines were given during a single visit. Revaccination should be avoided in cats that have a history of vaccine-triggered anaphylaxis.

In some cats however, tumors develop at the injection sites usually between three months and three years after vaccination. These tumors are mainly fibrosarcomas, malignant histiocytomas, and osteosarcomas. Less common forms include rhabdomyosarcomas, hemangiosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, liposarcomas, and lymphosarcomas. These tumors are highly invasive and may metastasize. Successful treatment requires a combination of radical surgical excision and adjunct therapy, including radiation, immunotherapy (such as interleukin [IL]-2 treatment), and chemotherapy, but recurrence is common.",

            "text": "These sarcomas were first noticed following the introduction of potent, inactivated, adjuvanted vaccines such as those directed against rabies and feline leukemia. Cats with sarcomas occurring at sites where vaccines are currently administered were compared with cats that developed sarcomas at nonvaccine-injection sites. Cats receiving an inactivated FeLV vaccine were 5.5 times more likely to develop a sarcoma at the injection site than cats that had not received a vaccine. There was a twofold increase in risk with rabies vaccination. However, the risk was not enormously high. It has been calculated that 1 to 3.6 sarcomas develop per 10,000 vaccinated cats in the United States. (The prevalence of sarcomas in the United Kingdom is somewhat lower at 0.021 per 10,000 vaccinated cats.) The risk increased with the number of doses of vaccine administered; a 50% increase following one dose, a 127% increase following two doses, and a 175% increase following three or four vaccines given simultaneously. Vaccine-associated sarcomas tend to occur in younger animals and are larger and more aggressive than sarcomas arising at other sites. They metastasize in 25% to 70% of cases. In one study, injection site sarcomas developed on average 26 months after rabies vaccination and 11 months after FeLV vaccination. Global, web-based surveys suggest a somewhat lower prevalence of sarcomas (0.63 sarcomas/10,000 cats or 0.32 sarcomas/10,000 doses of all vaccines, or one sarcoma from 31,000 doses administered). It must be pointed out therefore that the chances of developing a sarcoma are considerably smaller than the disease risks incurred by unvaccinated cats. In addition to rabies and FeLV vaccines, injection site sarcomas have also been associated with administration of inactivated vaccines against feline panleukopenia, feline herpesvirus, and feline calicivirus. Similar vaccination-related injection site sarcomas have been reported in ferrets, dogs, and a horse. Data from the UK's pharmacovigilance reports suggest that the prevalence of these sarcomas has been dropping progressively (Fig. 14.2) .",

Indeed, it has been estimated that 15% to 20% of cancer deaths worldwide are associated with persistent infections and chronic inflammation. When first reported it was assumed that tumor development resulted from the presence of potent adjuvants in vaccines. Tumor development has however also been associated with the use of nonadjuvanted vaccines and even with injection of substances other than vaccines, including penicillin, glucocorticoids, lufenuron, cisplatin, and meloxicam, in addition to the presence of persistent suture material, a retained surgical swab, or implanted microchips. There is no evidence that feline sarcoma virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, or feline leukemia viruses cause these tumors. Prolonged irritation will increase the activation state of the cells involved in inflammation and tissue repair. The repair process activates stem cells that can differentiate to replace damaged tissues. These stem cells are long lived and so have plenty of opportunities to accumulate mutations. Chronic, prolonged irritation leads to an increase in stem cells and the possibility that some of these may mutate (Fig. 14.3) . During chronic inflammation, macrophages secrete growth factors that enhance cell growth. Oxidants released from activated macrophages may act as mutagens, especially in rapidly dividing cells. Fibroblasts proliferate at sites of chronic inflammation and wound healing. In some of these fibroblasts, the sis oncogene may be activated. The sis oncogene codes for the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and vaccine-associated sarcomas have been shown to express both PDGF and its receptor. In contrast, nonvaccine-associated tumors and normal cat lymphocytes are PDGF negative. Therefore it has been suggested that lymphocytes within the vaccine-associated sarcomas secrete PDGF, which then serves as a growth factor for the fibroblasts. This combination of abnormalities could result in the loss of growth control in the fibroblasts engaged in the chronic inflammatory process.",

Activation of NF-kB is rapidly induced by viral and bacterial infections, necrotic cell products, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. NF-kB is activated when its specific inhibitors are destroyed by enzymes in the IKK complex. Most of the increased NF-kB activity that occurs in tumors is caused by the production of IKK-activating cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor. The loss of functional p53 also triggers NF-kB activation. This NF-kB plays key roles in the progressive steps of tumorigenesis. It is needed for the generation of reactive oxygen species that cause DNA damage and oncogenic mutations. It enhances tumor cell proliferation and survival. By chronically stimulating cancer cell proliferation, inhibiting cell death, and promoting mutagenesis, NF-kB drives malignant progression.",

They must be treated by radical resection, but this is often difficult, requires a long recovery period, and may cause significant disfigurement (Figs. 14.4 and 14.5). This is especially true of cats vaccinated subcutaneously in the interscapular region. The American Association of Feline Practitioners recommends that the three core vaccines against feline panleukopenia (FPV ), feline herpesvirus-1, and feline calicivirus be injected subcutaneously below the elbow on the right forelimb and vaccines against feline leukemia, FIV, and rabies virus be injected below the stifle joint on the left and right hind leg respectively. Another possible injection site is in the distal tail. There are no significant differences in the cat's immune response. Both routes elicit similar antibody responses to FPV and to rabies antigens. Vaccines should be administered as distally as possible to permit amputation if required. The site of vaccine administration and the product used should be recorded for each vaccine to help in assessing risk factors. Clients should be instructed to monitor injection sites for swellings or lumps so that any developing tumors are detected and excised as early as possible. ",
