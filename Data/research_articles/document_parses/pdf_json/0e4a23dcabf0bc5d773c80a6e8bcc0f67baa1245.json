From an anesthesiology 53 point of view, routine thorax computed tomography (CT) 54 was requested 24 h before surgery by 27.7% of the experts, 55 whereas, 61.7% requested thorax CT in the case of COVID-19 56 suspicion. Some 34% of the respondents preferred spinal 57 anesthesia instead of general anesthesia, whereas 17% 58 continued with spinal anesthesia as used before the 59 pandemic (Fig. 1C), possibly because of the well-known 60 safety of spinal anesthesia in stone surgery [3]. Unless 61 contraindicated, we think that endourologists may prefer 62 regional anesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic, 63 depending on their hospital conditions. 64 Nearly half of the respondents (48.9%) stated that COVID-65 19 patients have been hospitalized in their departments, 66 with approximately 40% taking an active role in evaluating 67 respiratory symptoms in these patients (Fig. 1D). Therefore, 68 it is obvious that although not specializing in the manage-69 ment of contagious diseases, all health care staff including 70 doctors specializing in other disciplines have been obliged 71 to deal with the pandemic. More than 85% of the 72 participants reported a decrease of >50% in the workload 73 of outpatient clinics. Routine treatment protocols for stone 74 management were reported as altered by 91.3% of the 75 experts. Changes in routine treatment protocols were 76 further investigated in the questionnaire for certain clinical 77 situations. For management of stones of <2 cm and 2-3 cm 78 in size, 31.9% and 27.6% of the participants, respectively, 79 stated that they would prefer a conservative approach until 80 the pandemic settles. In addition, approximately two-thirds 81 stated that they would postpone any auxiliary procedure 82 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and 51% stated that they 83 would discharge patients on the same day or within 24 h 84 postoperatively. 85 Another important aspect is emergency department 86 admission of stone patients. Emergency physicians encoun-87 ter stone patients with more severe conditions such as colic 88 pain, acute renal failure, and pyelonephritis.

Changes in sterilization strategies during the 111 COVID-19 pandemic were also included in the question-112 naire: only 34.8% of the respondents did change their 113 routine strategy for sterilization.
