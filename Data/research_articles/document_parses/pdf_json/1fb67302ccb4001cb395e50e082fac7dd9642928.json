In this context, many countries are now in some degree of lockdown to ensure extreme social distancing of entire population and hence slowing down the epidemic spread. Further, authorities use case quarantine strategy and manual second/third contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 disease. However, manual contact tracing is time consuming and labor-intensive task which tremendously overload public health systems. In this paper, we developed a smartphone-based approach to automatically and widely trace the contacts for confirmed COVID-19 cases. Particularly, contacttracing approach creates a list of individuals in the vicinity and notifying contacts or officials of confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach is not only providing awareness to individuals they are in the proximity to the infected area, but also tracks the incidental contacts that the COVID-19 carrier might not recall. Thereafter, we developed a dashboard to provide a plan for government officials on how lockdown/mass quarantine can be safely lifted, and hence tackling the economic crisis. The dashboard used to predict the level of lockdown area based on collected positions and distance measurements of the registered users in the vicinity. The prediction model uses K-means algorithm as an unsupervised machine learning technique for lockdown management.",

Smartphone can use wireless technology data to track people when they near each other. In particular, when someone is confirmed with positive COVID-19, the status of the smartphone will be updated and, then the app will notify all phones in the vicinity. For example, if someone tests positive of COVID-19 and stood near a person in the mall earlier that week. The COVID-19 carrier would not be able to memorize the person's name for manual contact tracing. In this scenario, the smartphone contact-tracing app is very promising to notify that person [8] . This automated virus tracking approach could really transform the ability governments and health authorities to contain the and control the epidemic. In this situation, a dashboard is required to assist governments and health authorities to predict when lockdown and self-quarantine will end. This research first reviews the state-of-the-art solutions to combat COVID-19.

            "text": "In [9] the authors modeled on how COVID-19 spreads over populations in countries in terms of the transmission speed and containing its spreading. In the model, R is representing the reproduction number, which is defined the ability of the virus in infecting other people as a chain of contagious infection. Infected individuals rapidly infect a group of people over very short period of time, which then yields an outbreak. On the contrary, the infection would be in control if the probability gets closer of one person to infect less than one other person. This is exactly happening in Fig. 1 ; when people (black color) who have come into contact with an infected person (red color), the infection would be spread rapidly. One important aspect is how the number of infected people looks like depends on several factors, such as the number of vulnerable people in the communities, The time takes to recover a person without symptoms, the social contacts and possibility of infecting them with coronavirus. Further, another factor will affect fast spreading of coronavirus is the frequency of visiting crowded places such as malls and minimarkets. Thus, governments and public health authorities are responsible to manage and plan a convenient way to contain the epidemic. Moreover, countries at the early stage of virus spreading need to control the epidemic by typically isolating and testing suspected cases tracing their contact and quarantine those people in case they are infected. Testing and contact tracing at wide scale, the better the chance of containment. In the case of COVID-19, research studies have been conducted for containment or controlling the fast spreading, and hence helping governments and societies in ending this epidemic. In [10] , the authors have investigated the importance of confirmed COVID-19 case isolation that could play a key role in controlling the disease. They have utilized a mathematical model to measure the effectiveness of this strategy in controlling the transmission speed of COVID-19. To achieve this goal, a stochastic transmission model is developed to overcome the fast person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. According to their research study, controlling virus transmission is within 12 weeks or by a threshold of accumulative 5000 cases. However, controlling the spread of the virus using this mathematical approach is highly correlated to other factors like pathogen and the reaction of people.",

When a patient is diagnosed with infectious disease like COVID-19, contact-tracing is an important step to slowing down the transmission [11] . This technique seeks to identify people who have had close contact with infected individuals and who therefore may be infect themselves. This targeted strategy reduces the need for stay at home periods. However, manual contact tracing is subject to a person's ability to recall everyone they have come in contact over a two week's period. In [11] , the authors exploited the cellphone's Bluetooth to constantly advertise the presence of people. These anonymous advertisements, named chirps in Bluetooth, are not containing positional or personally identifiable information. Every phone stores all the chirps that it has sent and overheard from nearby phones. Their system uses these lists to enable contact-tracing for people diagnosed with COVID-19. This system is not only traces infected individuals, but it also estimates distance between individuals and amount of time they spent in close proximity to each other. When a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, doctors would coordinate with the patient to upload all the chirps sent out by their phone to the public database. Meanwhile, people who have not been diagnosed can their phones do a daily scan of public database, to see if their phones have overheard any of the chirps used by people later diagnosed by COVID-19. This indicates that they were in close prolonged contact with that anonymous individual. Fig. 2 shows the procedure of exchanging anonymous ID among users for contact-tracing.",

Effectiveness of the application and digital contact tracing depends on two factors speed and coverage.

This part of the system is to monitoring and tracing the registered users only in terms of how the areas (which have been visited by users) should be lockdown or not? To this end, an unsupervised machine learning (UML) algorithm has been implemented in the system. There are several UML algorithms including Neural networks, Anomaly detection, Clustering and etc. However, for this system, K-means Clustering algorithm is used to predict the lockdown approach for the visited area. The K-means algorithm, first, reads the tracked users' position information and their status COVID-19. Then, in the next step will calculate the centroid position of the areas based on the DASV seeding method. The DASV method is a good algorithm to select the best centroid position of a set of nearest positions in the vicinity. Then, the centroid positions will be Once, the process of the clustering of the tracked users' positions information has completed, a set of clusters will be produced. Then for each cluster, the distances between the positions of the different users are calculated. This is to calculate how many times the users, in the vicinity, are approaching to each other (from now called AEO). For this study, five users (user A, user B, user C, user D, and user E) are participated into the system in two different areas in USA. Therefore, two different scenarios via the five users are conducted for the K-means algorithm, as shown in figure 3. In the first scenario the users are walking and they are located in Denver area in Colorado-USA, while in the second scenario they are located in Aspen area in Colorado-USA.",

We also developed a dashboard to advise health authorities on how specific area safely get people back to their normal life. The proposed prediction model is used positional information and distance measurements of the registered users in the proximity. The government and public health authorities would be able to take benefit from the proposed dashboard to get latest statistics on COVID-19 cases and lockdown recommendation in different areas. The weak point of this study is the privacy issue of tracking position information of the users. This issue would be solved by applying encryption algorithms, in near future. However, such proposed system is significant to mitigate economic crisis and easing lockdown issues.",
