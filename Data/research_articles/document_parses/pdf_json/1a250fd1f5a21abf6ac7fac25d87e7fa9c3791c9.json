Difficult-to-treat asthma is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite GINA Step 4 or 5 treatment, or that requires such treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations 1 . According to the most recent GINA Guidelines (2019) 3.7% of patients with asthma have severe asthma. Despite the rather small percentage of patients with severe asthma, they disproportionally incur 40-50% of all asthma related costs 2 . Anti IL5 therapy is now an established therapy for the treatment of uncontrolled severe asthma. Currently 8 patients are receiving Mepolizumab therapy in Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown. The aim of the study was to look at the real-life outcomes from Mepolizumab in our patient population. Before commencing anti IL5 therapy 90% of the patients were on long term oral corticosteroids (OCS). Response to therapy was evaluated using the Asthma Control Questionnaire 7 (ACQ7), Asthma Control Test (ACT), St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), steroid reduction and exacerbation rates. To date, 50 % of patients have had a minimal clinical important difference (MCID) improvement in ACQ7 scores. 50% of our study population have discontinued OCS and 50% have had a reduction in their steroid dose. SGRQ has shown MCID improvements in 63% of patients. There has been a 75% reduction in exacerbation rates. Measurement of fractional nitric oxide concentration in exhaled breath (FENO) is a method of measuring airway inflammation and assessing airways disease. In recent years, the Global Initiative Guide for Asthma (GINA) recommends the use of FENO as a tool for asthma management, combined with symptom assessment questionnaires and spirometry. We preformed a retrospective study aiming to explore the utilisation and utility of FENO in our clinic. Many of the patients had multiple measurements of FENO, we selected patients attending our clinic between January 2018 and May 2019, who had at least 4 FENO measurements. We analysed changes in FENO and FEV1 over time in 83patients (1 st , between 1-12months and last FENO measurements). This showed the Introduction Assessing responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy is complicated by poor adherence rates, making it difficult to distinguish refractory patients from those who are non-adherent. As a result there is a significant risk of inappropriate prescription of high-dose ICS, with an associated increase in side-effects. Personalised dosing of ICS therapy is required to achieve the optimal trade-off between asthma control and side effects. Methods Using electronic monitoring of inhaler adherence and PEFR, we developed a statistical method to quantify responsiveness to treatment and determine the optimal dose for an individual asthma patient. Results We estimated personal threshold dosages for a cohort of 200 severe asthma patients. We quantify the personal level of treatment received using the time-above-threshold metric (Greene et al. 2018), and find that it is highly predictive of asthma control and exacerbations. The distribution of personalised dosages ( Fig.  1) shows that the majority of patients in our cohort are over-prescribed ICS. However many remained uncontrolled due to poor adherence. In addition a significant minority of patients (approx 15%) are truly refractory to ICS treatment. Patients who experienced frequent exacerbations had significantly higher threshold doses than those who did not exacerbate (p<0.001), suggesting that exacerbations were associated with steroid-resistance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3197, "end": 3205, "text": "Fig.  1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "1.

Uncontrolled asthma is characterized by poor symptom control and exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids. Patients are deemed refractory to treatment if they remain uncontrolled despite; adherence to guideline directed therapy and treatment of contributing factors 1 . We hypothesize that using INCA\u2122 technology we can distinguish between patients who are truly refractory to treatment and require type 2 targeted biologic treatments versus those who are not. We report the outcome of two patients with uncontrolled asthma who were both candidates for step-up therapy. They were recruited into a multicentre, prospective, randomized controlled study of uncontrolled asthma (INCASUN). They were both randomized; one received INCA\u2122 directed inhaler education and medication adjustment according to objective adherence. The second was blinded to what the INCA\u2122 technology was recording, received standard care and medication adjustment as per the GINA guidelines. On completion of the study both patients remained uncontrolled despite optimizing treatment, resulting in both being referred for step-up therapy. The INCA\u2122 data was unblinded for the standard care patient and revealed suboptimal adherence negating the need for step-up therapy. Without an objective measure of adherence it is difficult to determine patients who are truly refractory to treatment. INCA\u2122 technology assists clinicians in identifying patients who require stepup therapy while also preventing inappropriate prescribing where adherence is the real issue. 1 The Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University Hospital, Wilton, Cork. 2 The HRB funded CRF, University College Cork, Cork.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 540, "end": 541, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1805, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1887, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Eosinophils are associated with higher exacerbation frequency and increased asthma severity.

Asthma is a heterogeneous group of conditions that results in recurrent episodes of reversible airway obstruction. It presents with varying clinical severity from mild, occasional symptoms to frequent severe exacerbations which can be fatal. Ireland has the fourth highest prevalence of the disease worldwide. In a small percentage of patients eosinophils play a significant role in the pathogenesis and severity of asthma. Mepolizumab (Nucala\u00ae) targets IL-5, the main cytokine responsible for the growth, differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Inhibition of IL-5 signaling reduces the production and survival of eosinophils which in turn reduces the severity of asthma symptoms and the number of exacerbations in patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma which remains uncontrolled despite maximum therapy. November 2018 saw the first patients commence Mepolizumab in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital at a dedicated nurse-led new biologics clinic.

FVC predicted % is a predictor of mortality in this study which, to our knowledge, was not found to be so in other studies. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive respiratory condition defined by airway inflammation and partially reversible airflow obstruction. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure is the assumed standard of care in the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to Acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD). The national standard of in-hospital mortality for COPD patients is 15% (1). We reviewed the patients admitted with AE-COPD requiring NIV (ie: acidotic with a ph < 7.35 and pCO2 > 6.3kPa). We included all adult patients admitted to hospital with AHRF secondary to AE-COPD. We defined AHRF by an admitting ph < 7.35 and a baseline partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) greater than 6.3kPa. The primary outcome measure was mortality during the hospital episode of respiratory failure. Early intervention of NIV for acidotic respiratory failure reduced inhospital mortality and the need for invasive ventilation in the Intensive care unit (ICU).

The purpose of this study was to explore the guidelines for returning to driving for a patient who is oxygen dependent. Patients suffering from ILD (interstitial lung disease), IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are referred to occupational therapy for assistance with return to activities of daily living. Many of these people are young, still working, and in many cases, driving. For some of these patients, the use of oxygen is a short term measure while they await a lung transplant, for others it's a long term prescription, but regardless of duration of oxygen prescription, many of these patients need to return to driving for their jobs, social interactions, and quality of life.

Mologic Laboratories, Bedford, UK. 7 School of Medicine, Trinity College Dublin BACKGROUND: Lung inflammation and subsequent lung injury are a major component of the morbidity and mortality associated with CF. Biomarkers of lung injury can be found in urine. The analysis of biomarkers in urine represents a promising noninvasive approach to predicting lung injury, particularly in children. In a previous phase of this study, we have demonstrated differences in biomarker levels in the urine of children with CF compared to controls. The longitudinal variability of urine biomarkers in children is unknown. AIMS: To determine the natural longitudinal variability of urinary biomarker levels in children with CF and healthy controls. METHODS: Urine samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks at home, from children with CF and healthy controls. Sampling was increased to every two days when the children with CF unwell -defined as the presence of a new cough. The levels of 26 different biomarkers were determined in the urine samples of 18 children (18 CF, 4 control), by ELISA. The intraindividual (CVi) coefficient of variations of different biomarkers were first calculated for each of the 18 children. The interindividual (CVg) was then measured between the CF and control groups. RESULTS: The CVi was high across all the measured biomarkers, with the highest average being Matrix Metalloprotease-8 (MMP8) at 154.6% and the lowest being Tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-2 (TIMP2) at 46.8%. There was no significant difference between the the CVi of the control and CF groups for any biomarker or between the CVi of those in the CF group when stable or unwell. The CVg was, on average, higher in the group with CF versus the control group. CONCLUSION: Biological variation indices show that urine biomarkers are highly very variable longitudinally in children with and without CF. Variability between individuals was however more pronounced in the CF group. Further work will focus analysis of grouped biomarkers and on longitudinal relationship to outcomes. Guidelines on the management of children with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) recommend the use of augmented cough techniques in patients with ineffective cough (including children >12 years with cough peak flows (CPF) <270 litres/min)1. We aimed to assess the use of these techniques in our patient population. We performed a retrospective chart review from June 2018 to June 2019. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) including CPF measurements and respiratory physiotherapy assessments including use of cough augmentation techniques were recorded and analysed using Microsoft Excel. Ninety-six children with NMD attend the multidisciplinary (MDT) respiratory clinic at our institution. Thirty-eight were >12 years and had attempted PFT including CPF in the previous year. Thirty of 38 (79%) were using cough augmentation techniques with 27/30 using MI-E and 3 using manual breath-stacking methods. All patients had documented clinical impression of weak cough. Twenty-one of the 30 patients (70%) had performed CPF (mean 206 litres/min, range 90 -378 litres/min) and 27/30 (90%) performed forced vital capacity (mean 1.92 litres, range 0.61 -3.97 litres). Our review demonstrates a high proportion of patients >12 years using assisted cough techniques particularly MI-E. The support of a MDT including respiratory physiotherapy and pulmonary physiology testing facilitates adherence to international standards. Reference Vitamin E (Vit E) levels appear to have increased in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients attending Children's Health Ireland (CHI) at Temple Street (TS). Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy has a definite positive impact on nutritional status but the reasons behind this are not clearly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate a link between modulator treatment and Vit E serum levels. Vit E levels of CF patients were recorded retrospectively from the Clinical Portal System at CHI at TS from the years 2017 (n=92), 2018 (n=98) and 2019 (n=75).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 552, "end": 553, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, {"text": "A significant number of patients had high Vit E levels with 24/75 recorded in 2019. 12/ 24 are on modulator therapy.

Interestingly this study shows a shift in serum levels away from treating deficiency towards managing excess. This is in stark contrast to practice over the past decade where dieticians sought to correct deficient serum levels of fat soluble vitamins through supplementation and diet. Newly licenced Vitamin A, D, E & K supplements have higher levels of fat soluble vitamins than current preparations and based on our recent finding may no longer be clinically indicated.

Results: Fifteen children taking Ivacaftor (mean age of commencement 6.2 years) were pancreatic insufficient prior to commencing Ivacaftor (FE <200\u03bcg/g). At follow up, nine were found to be pancreatic sufficient (FE 200->500\u03bcg/g) and three had mild pancreatic insufficiency (FE >100-200\u03bcg/g). Of the nine children with restored pancreatic sufficiency (ranging in age from 2-6), all discontinued, and have remained off, PERT without abdominal symptoms or weight loss after a minimum follow up period of 3 months.

In this study patients taking part in two RCTs were asked to select treatment goals to reflect successful treatment from a patient's perpective. These goals were categorised as: disease-specific, knowledge-based, and functional (pertaining to activities of daily life). While current practice focusses on disease-specific goals for the longterm management of asthma, as outlined by GINA, almost half of patient-selected goals were functional as opposed to disease-specific. Indeed, goal achievement was found to be significantly higher in diseasespecific rather than functional-based goals (odds ration 1.667, 95% C.I: 1.1-2.52). This indicates that while current management strategies address disease-specific goals, patients often fail to achieve their funcational goals. This may result in a perceived failure of treatment impacting patient engagement. Furthermore, the relationship between lung function and goal category selection is not mirrored by commonly used asthma questionnaires in these data (eg. ACT).

The audit included 100 episodes of care from 4 different departments. The questionnaires developed using the Tobacco cessation guidelines for COPD 1 found that 91% of patients were asked about their smoking status, 95% of all identified smokers were advised and were assessed for their interest in quitting and 80% of them received more than one intervention offered (40% of smokers were offered assistance with pharmacological support, 42.5% were offered behaviour support and further follow up). It was also found that a considerable amount of smokers had declined the offer for assistance (10% has declined pharmacological support and 25% for behaviour support). The overall result indicated that SCIs are an integral part of caring for patients with COPD in St. Michaels hospital. However, there is more room for improvement in all areas of interventions. Appropriate identification of smokers and initiating motivational advice that is personalised and specific to patients with COPD could increase their chance of adopting SCIs. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a hereditary condition that causes lung, liver and skin disease with the ZZ phenotype resulting in severe deficiency. The highly prevalent MZ phenotype (1/25 of the Irish population) causes a moderate deficiency which interacts with smoking to increase the risk of COPD ten-fold compared to usual smokers (1). We examined the relationship between a diagnosis of MZ-AATD and patient smoking habits. We attempted to contact 154 MZ on the National AATD Registry achieving 91 responses (59.1%). A custom questionnaire was designed and responses were captured using survey software (QuestionPro\u00ae). Among ever-smoking respondents (n=49, 57% female) mean tobacco consumption was 22.57 (SD \u00b1 14.4) pack-years, with a mean GOLD airflow obstruction of 1.59 and only 8 (16.3%) individuals reporting active-smoking. Importantly, 60% of those quitting after a diagnosis of MZ-AATD did so within 6 months, while the 6 month quit rate was 12% for those who reported quitting after a diagnosis of COPD. Our data demonstrates significantly lower active smoking in ever-smoking MZs versus typical COPD cohorts (2) . There are an estimated 50,000 MZ smokers in Ireland. Identifying smoking MZs may help to improve cessation rates in this high-risk cohort and reduce their long-term morbidity. Benefits for nurse-led service provision by advanced nurse practitioners (ANPs) are well substantiated in international literature. Central to the role of Respiratory ANPs is patient-centred care and preference which encompasses empowerment, self-management and health promotion opportunities. In addition, a requirement of the role is to proactively seek feedback from persons receiving such care. 1 The purpose of the survey was to elicit patients' satisfaction with the quality of care received by Respiratory ANPs across 5 hospital sites in Ireland in order to evaluate current service provision as perceived by the patient. A non-experimental, descriptive design was used. One hundred sixty two clients who were reviewed by a Respiratory ANP in a hospital setting over a 6-month period were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected by means of an adapted validated self-administered questionnaire 2 . Eighty six clients chose to participate, yielding response rate of 53%. Data were analysed using Excel statistical functions. The majority of respondents (N\u226580) strongly agreed that the ANPs were interested and thorough, provided health education including inhaler technique and medicines management and allowed sufficient time for discussion. All respondents indicated that they would like to see the ANP again for a similar health need.

At the end of the PR programme, a questionnaire was administered to each of the 18 participants. 94.4% of participants (n=17) stated that the pedometer did encourage them to exercise, 88.9%(n=16) of participants stated that they would continue to use the pedometer after the classes have finished. 100% of participants stated that they would recommend use of the pedometer in future classes.

As part of the national COPD collaborative project, we aimed to reduce the length of stay (LOS) of patients presenting with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD); to improve access to the respiratory specialist service and to introduce a COPD Bundle of care to the emergency department. As part of the National COPD Improvement Collaborative project, a team was established in Naas General Hospital and weekly meetings were held. Process mapping was used, and baseline data gathered to understand the complexities of our current system. Subsequently, SMART aims and driver diagrams were developed, change ideas were generated and tested using the PDSA cycle ( Figure 1) . A respiratory nurse attended the emergency department to screen for patients attending with AECOPD and a COPD management bundle was introduced at the point of triage. By introducing early respiratory review there was a reduction in LOS from 8 days to 5 days. Time from patient registration to review by respiratory specialist improved by 2 days. Furthermore, introduction of COPD bundle ensured that every patient attending with AECOPD received standardised care. COPD is a major burden for Irish Emergency Departments (ED). Long waits to be seen by a clinician, high admission rates and sub-optimal care impair the delivery of services and patient wellbeing. 1 In September 2018 we introduced a nurse practitioner (NP) service for patients presenting with exacerbations of COPD to our ED. Patients are screened by the triage nurse using eligibility criteria. If a patient meets the criteria, the NP is contacted and promptly comes to assess the patient. The NP independently assesses, diagnoses, treats and refers the patient for admission or discharge. To date, 86 patients have been assessed. For those with exacerbations of COPD (52), 80% were discharged home. The 30 day ED re-presentation rate was 17% (9) with 2 of these patients requiring hospital admission. The median length of ED stay for these patients was 2.5 hours. A reduction of 18% has been seen in the hospital admission rate for COPD when compared to the same period last year.

The Collaborative aims to facilitate the development of participating teams' QI skills and to empower them to generate improvement specific to their own hospital/patients' needs through adherence to evidence-based standards of care and the implementation of care bundles. QI theory and methodology is taught at five face-to-face national \"Learning Sessions (LS)\" with hospital site visits between each LS. Evaluation focuses on assessment of monthly patient data (22 measures) submitted by each team relating to the acute care journey of patients presenting with AECOPD. Run charts will be used and data will be cohorted for analysis according to the focus of each team's project(s). A survey will be administered at the final LS (September 2019) to explore whether team members feel they have effectively learned QI methodology and whether this knowledge allowed them to improve patient care in their hospital. Impact on patient care will be qualitatively analysed. Ireland has an estimated 500,000 people with COPD and is currently the main reason for presentations to emergency departments in Ireland. Evidence shows COPD patients have poor MA. Outreach services/care is becoming more popular in the management of COPD in Ireland. A systematic review was completed on all available research on COPD patients whose MA was studied in the community with a vast online database search yielding 8 articles. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was used to review the articles (4 randomised control trials and 4 pre-and-post intervention studies). Of the 8 studies, 2 were deemed non-valid, but were included due to the lack of available articles. All studies measured MA as either a primary or secondary outcome and this SR demonstrated the ability to improve MA from outreach programmes. This SR determined MA has the potential to be improved from an outreach programme but requires more high-quality research in the area to develop a standardised plan for outreach programmes on MA. The aim of this study was to achieve and sustain 80% of patients having their inhaler technique checked and for 100% of patients to receive a selfmanagement plan and discharge bundle by January 31 st 2019. Our initial audit results showed inconsistent assessment of patient's inhaler technique and a lack of discharge planning and self-management plan, 10% and 0% respectively. The inhaler technique checklist from the National Asthma Council Australia was amended to include all inhalers licenced for COPD management in Ireland. Following education, physiotherapists began assessing inhaler technique as part of their in-patient treatment. A new self-management plan and discharge bundle was developed based on a review of national and international resources, multi-disciplinary team (MDT) discussion and patient consultation. Inhaler technique and the use of the discharge bundle and selfmanagement plan improved from 10% to 100% and 0% to 100% respectively by January 2019. Sustainability has varied depending on annual leave, staffing resources and time. There is evidence for the importance of correct inhaler technique and the use of self-management plans and discharge bundles (Molimard et al. This quality improvement initiative focused on i) improving early access to assessment for patients admitted to Mayo University Hospital (MUH) with AECOPD by both a Respiratory Nurse and Physiotherapy and ii) standardisation of treatment. All AECOPD patients will have a Respiratory Nurse and Respiratory Physiotherapy assessment within 24 hours of admission between Sunday to Thursday and will have an intervention bundle completed prior to discharge. The Respiratory Nurse and Respiratory Physiotherapist pro-actively attended ED and AMAU daily to ensure all AECOPD patients would receive standardised respiratory interventions. The patients then received a standardised intervention bundle based on BTS 2016 and GOLD 2019 guidelines. The primary outcome was to reduce the amount of time to first respiratory assessment to <24hrs. This was achieved for 8/11 months (73%), with reduced staffing and weekend admissions being the main reasons for failing to achieve this every month. Evidence of prescription review with patient improved from 0% to 89% in August 2019. Completion of the intervention bundle improved from 10% to 89%. Follow up phone call within 72hours improved from 0% t0 100%. Evidence of provision of the self-management plan improved from 0% to 44%. Early respiratory assessment for patients admitted with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) resulted in an improvement in quality and consistency of care delivered in line with best practice. A COPD support group was established in 2007 following on from completion of pulmonary rehab program. Its aim was to facilitate and support ongoing education, self-management and exercise for COPD patients in the North west After completion of a pulmonary rehab programme, the necessity of a regular review/engagement with hospital MDT staff was identified by all patients on their post pulmonary rehab evaluation. As an objective to meet the needs of the COPD patients, the inaugural COPD/Respiratory Support group was commenced in JULY 2007. The BENBULBEN COPD Support group has been successfully running since, with regular monthly meetings and weekly exercise classes. As A facilitator for Our local COPD/Respiratory Support group, I support the patients by phone, facilitate the speakers for the monthly meetings and give advice when required. On our 10year anniversary we retrospectively reviewed all original members admission to hospital rates for 2006/7and 20016/2017. We then reviewed all Spirometry for 2007 and compared to 2017and further reviewed in 2019. The benefit of the COPD support group was evaluated very positively, with all patients having fewer admission to hospital. Variability in lung function was static or had improved for most patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1724, "end": 1725, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1052, "end": 1061, "text": "Figure 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Most popular ACTs used by physiotherapists for ECOPD (on wards)"}, {"text": "The benefits of a COPD support group are patient centred, cost effective and beneficial to all. Empowering our patients with regular MDT education updates, social engagement and self management prevents hospital admissions and maintains lung function. The aim of this project was to improve and standardise the treatment pathway for patients admitted to hospital with COPD, from admission to discharge. Patients with COPD, who attended the Emergency Department (ED), were to be reviewed by the respiratory ANP, where appropriate, and initiate a management pathway. If the patient was deemed suitable for discharge, COPD Outreach would provide appropriate follow-up care. If the patient was to be admitted, the patients were to be reviewed within 24-48 hours by a respiratory CNS to optimise COPD treatment, initiate a discharge bundle, provide education, check inhaler technique and ensure adequate follow-up was put in place. On discharge, the patient would link in with COPD Outreach. Since September 2018, 86 patients have been reviewed in ED by an ANP, 80% of patients with COPD were discharged home. There has also been an 18% reduction in admission rates. Since November 2018, 115 of admitted cases were reviewed by the CNS, 65% of all COPD admissions.

Gaps were identified in COPD management such as no care bundles / standardised tools, lack of confirmed diagnosis, inhaler technique not routinely checked, and suboptimal respiratory follow-up. Nenagh Hospital implemented a Discharge Bundle, to address these gaps. Stakeholders were identified, including the local COPD support group. Monthly meetings were arranged. Process mapping, SMART aims, and PDSA's followed. Training sessions completed for staff. A draft bundle was trialled and amended based on feedback. Monthly audits completed and analysed. 50% of patients admitted now have a discharge bundle. Spirometry results are now accessible and a shared access folder is available across sites. Training provided enhanced staff knowledge of inhaler devices for prescription and review. Referrals to the respiratory team increased from 20% to 100%. Setting out to implement a Discharge Bundle allowed us to identify gaps in the COPD service. The process required multidisciplinary input to establish the care bundle. We did not achieve 100% of our goals, but our successes to date demonstrate positive outcomes. The aim was to develop an evidence based admission bundle that would standardise assessment, aid clinical decision making and ensure optimum care for all patients. The goal for this project was to improve the overall care for patients presenting with AECOPD and allow an evidence-based approach in their management .We looked at the DECAF assessment tool, which is a simple and effective predictor of mortality in patients hospitalised with AECOPD and which also proved beneficial to clinicians to more accurately predict patient outcomes and levels of care (Steer et al. 2012). The components of the Admission Care Bundle were developed following a review of current best practice guidelines including BTS. 100% of patients presenting with AECOPD to Ennis MAU are assessed using the pathway & outcomes have improved as a result. Spirometry results are now available on a shared database. The DECAF tool has assisted clinical decision making, allowing clinicians to contemplate safe discharge The AECOPD Intervention Bundle has ensured appropriate management of all patients presenting with suspected or known COPD. Early introduction of COPD outreach would significantly benefit patients with a low DECAF score in the community.

A COPD admission intervention bundle was implemented with the aim of improving care and reducing readmissions for patients admitted to the AMAU with acute exacerbations of COPD. The goal for this project was to improve the overall care for COPD exacerbating patients and to standardise treatment for this group of patients. Evidence based care has been shown to improve quality of life, reduce length of stay and on occasions avoid hospital admission. The admission bundle allowed for a more streamlined approach of the standardised treatment for this patient group. Results: The care bundle was implemented in the AMAU department with the overall care of AECOPD patients being improved. Spirometry results are available on a shared database for all respiratory patients. Conclusion: The COPD management intervention bundle and DECAF assessment tool has significantly proven the importance of standardised care. A designated team to capture all AECOPD patients presenting to ED/AMAU throughout the hospital group would reduce admissions, exacerbations and improve quality of care. Viral, bacterial, allergic and inflammatory pathways are implicated in the pathophysiology of CF exacerbations. We hypothesise that subtypes of CF exacerbation exist that predict clinical outcomes. This prospective cohort study recruited 72 patients at onset of a CF exacerbation. Three exacerbation categories were proposed: pauciinflammatory (CRP <5mg/L), viral (CRP \u2265 5mg/L and viral infection) and bacterial (CRP \u2265 5mg/L and no viral infection). Clinical data (FEV 1 , IV antibiotic duration) and biologic samples (serum CRP, plasma biomarkers, sputum \u00b1 nasal viral PCR) were collected at exacerbation onset. Chi-square, ordinal logistic regression and linear regression were used to test for trends between phenotypes. The most prevalent category was \"pauci-inflammatory\" (40.58%) followed by \"bacterial\" (36.23%) and \"viral\" (23.19%). Baseline microbiological status and exacerbation history did not differ between phenotypes. Significant differences between phenotypes were present in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IgG. Relative drop in FEV 1 The prevalence of concomitant asthma in CF has been estimated at 14-19%. Little information is available on CF patients' inhaler technique or adherence,making it difficult to determine the effectiveness of inhaled medications in CF. In this cross-sectional study a chart review of 173 CF patients attending Cork University Hospital was performed.Inhaler technique and adherence were assessed in a subset of patients using validated technique scoring sheets and a validated self-reported adherence questionnaire. 34.9% had an elevated total IgE level.Reversibility was documented in 13.9%. 64.1% were prescribed a Short-Acting B 2 -Agonist,43.2% of which were prescribed as part of inhaled antibiotic regimens.52% were prescribed an Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-Acting B 2 -Agonist combination and 15% were prescribed a Long-Acting Anti-Cholinergic. 83.3% demonstrated suboptimal technique(score<100%),the mean total score being 74.2%.Patients scored worst in the \"Additional Steps\" category(mean=59.4%).96.8% previously received education on inhaler technique. 70.3% reported adherence rates of 81%-100%.The most common barrier to adherence was remembering to take a dose(29.4%). Analyses of total IgE and PFT results suggest a prevalence of the asthmatic phenotype of 13.9-34.9%,which is higher than previous studies. Remembering to take doses and the \"Additional Steps\" category were identified as key barriers to optimal inhaler adherence and technique. Future focus on these barriers may prove beneficial. Physical activity (PA) is a well-established therapeutic modality for improving long-term health in cystic fibrosis (CF). Healthcare professionals (HCPs) play a significant role in promoting PA behaviours. Limited research exists regarding Irish HCPs' knowledge and practice of PA promotion for people with CF. There is also a lack of research identifying the barriers experienced by CF-HCPs when promoting PA. The present study identified Irish HCPs' knowledge and practice in prescribing PA for CF and the barriers preventing such prescription. 48 HCPs (physiotherapists n=24, other n=24) from six CF-centers in Ireland, and members of the national physiotherapy clinical interest group, completed a 30-item online survey. 70% of CF-HCPs agreed that recommending PAwas part of their professional role, with three-quarters reportedly discussing PA at every patient visit. Almost all physiotherapists (95%) reported having sufficient knowledge regarding PA prescription, compared to 17% of other CF-HCPs. Interestingly, 81% of physiotherapists and 96% of other CF-HCPs reported receiving no formal undergraduate training in relation to exercise prescription for CF populations. The perceived deficiency among a high proportion of CF-HCPs, in relation to undergraduate education of CF-specific exercise prescription, is surprising and needs to be addressed, particularly with the high prevalence of CF in Ireland. RATIONALE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary disease is characterized by chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and sustained neutrophildominant inflammation. The lack of effective anti-inflammatory therapies for people with CF (PWCF) represents a significant challenge. OBJECTIVES: To identify altered immunometabolism in the CF neutrophil, and investigate the feasibility of specific inhibition of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as a CF anti-inflammatory strategy in vivo. METHODS: Key markers of increased aerobic glycolysis, known as a Warburg effect, including cytosolic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), phosphorylated PKM2, succinate, HIF-1\u03b1, lactate and the interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 precursor pro-IL-1\u03b2, as well as caspase-1 activity and processing of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1\u03b2 by the NLRP3 inflammasome, were measured in neutrophils from blood and airway secretions from healthy controls (n=12), PWCF (n=16) and PWCF post-double-lung transplant (n=6). The effects of specific inhibition of NLRP3 on airway inflammation and bacterial clearance were subsequently assessed in vivo. MAIN RESULTS: CF neutrophils display increased aerobic glycolysis in the systemic circulation. This effect is driven by low-level endotoxaemia, unaffected by CFTR modulation, and resolves post-transplant. The increased pro-IL-1\u03b2 produced is processed to its mature active form in the lipopolysaccharide-rich CF lung by the NLRP3 inflammasome via caspase-1. Specific NLRP3 inhibition in vivo with MCC950 inhibited IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs of CF mice (P<0.0001), resulting in significantly reduced airway inflammation and improved Pseudomonas clearance (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CF neutrophil immunometabolism is altered in response to inflammation. NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition may have an anti-inflammatory and anti-infective role in CF. Objectives: Recent clinical trials have supported the efficacy of Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor (Orkambi). We aimed to evaluate real world clinical effectiveness over 12 months Methods: Thirty-one standard clinic patients with a PhelF508del homozygous mutation were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months' post initiation of treatment. Changes in 1)clinical parameters including ppFEV 1 , BMI, IV antibiotic usage, number of hospital admissions 2)surrogate markers of CFTR modulation-sweat chloride, 3)disease/quality of life-related symptoms questionnaires 4)plasma/sputum inflammatory mediators were measured. Results: Significant and sustained improvement in lung function(ppFEV 1 \u21914.8%-p<0.001), BMI (\u21910.9kg/m2-p<0.001), sweat chloride(\u219317.6 mmol/l-p<0.001), IV antibiotic usage(\u219384%-p<0.001) and hospitalisations(\u219387%-p<0.01) at 1 year was noted. Improvements in quality of life were demonstrated; CFQ-R respiratory domain(+7 points-p<0.001), CFQ-R digestive domain(+6.6 points-p<0.05). Improvements in patient reported outcomes included; FACIT fatigue score(\u21915.6-p<0.001) and sino-nasal-outcome-test(\u21932.9-p=0.001). A significant change in sleep quality was not observed Plasma IL-1\u03b2(p<0.001), plasma TNF-\u03b1(p<0.01) and sputum IL-1\u03b2(p=0.001) were also reduced. Conclusion: Our real world cohort supports recent clinical trials with improvements in lung function, BMI, CFQR respiratory domain and exacerbation reduction. Our study additionally highlights improvements in sweat chloride, CFQR digestive domain and an important patient reported outcome of fatigue reduction. In addition to the standard quarterly review, patients often contact the CF Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) via phone to express health-related concerns which may require a phone evaluation before organizing an unscheduled appointment. Current resources are often heavily affected by the sporadic nature of these interactions. Furthermore, data from the European CF registry predicts that there will be a 75% increase in the adult CF population by 2025 which will further impact these limited resources 1 . For this reason, creating a system which could collect and report the patient's status so that the MDT can take timely and appropriate action would optimize the existing process. A series of meetings was held with members of the MDT and UCC Computer Science Department to develop an appropriate series of clinical questions. Two scoring systems were developed to evaluate the patient's condition and the change between their current and baseline conditions. Assessment and triage of patients will be partly based on these scores. The system has been developed for web and interacts with the patient via speech. A prototype has been developed and undergone technical evaluation. The front-end 3D avatar interface is currently in development before undergoing pilot testing and review with patients. The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) among the pretransplant Cystic Fibrosis (CF) population has become a rising concern in recent years. Reported prevalence in the literature ranges from 26.0%-63.2% between international centres. 1, 2 Here for the first time; we examine the prevalence of PAH in an Irish pre-transplant CF single-centre cohort. This study retrospectively examines the pre-transplant trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE), right heart catheterisation (where applicable) and spirometry results for all patients in the HSE South Adult CF Service undergoing lung-transplant assessment from 2009-2019. TTE results were scrutinised for evidence of increased right-heart pressures (raised RVSP, right-ventricular dilation, inter-ventricular septal flattening, right-atrial dilation, tricuspid regurgitation). Concomitant spirometry results were collated. A cohort of 20 patients underwent transplant work-up from 2009-2019. Figure 1 summarises their outcomes. 60% of included patients demonstrated evidence of increased right-heart pressures. The results suggest poorer outcomes within this group. Spirometric results showed a mean FEV1 0.95L(27.2% predicted). The data presented demonstrates a high prevalence of 60% for mildmoderate PAH among this Irish pre-transplant CF single-centre population with severe obstructive lung disease. This single-centre data supports the need for further interrogation of the national pre-transplant CF population to establish the true overall prevalence and clinical significance of PAH. Following the narrative analysis of the data in the 7 articles, it is evident that pain is a common problem affecting both paediatric and adult CF patients. Pain has a negative effect on the quality of life of these patients and is linked to higher incidences of depression and anxiety. It also negatively affects patient's treatment regimens and day to day life. There is limited research into this subject and therefore there is a need for further research.

Randomised controlled trials reported adverse events (AE) and have shown discontinuation rates of 14-33%. However post approval 'real world' datasets describe much higher discontinuation rates and allow for better understanding of side effects and tolerability. We retrospectively assessed the tolerability of OAF in our patient cohort to assess possible associations with patient clinical or diagnostic factors. We identified 67 patients with a diagnosis of IPF who had been prescribed an OAF. The overall discontinuation rate was 57%. This was the cumulative rate over a 4year period. We excluded patients who underwent lung transplantation from this analysis. Some interesting patient factors which may predict discontinuation of OAF therapy were identified. For example we found an interesting association between pre-treatment gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and OAF discontinuation. A total of 14 (63%) of patients who discontinued OAF had a diagnosis of GORD prior to initiation of OAF. Eleven (78%) of these patients were taking Pirfenidone. In our experience OAF are less well tolerated in practice then described in clinical trials, with patient specific factors requiring consideration pre-treatment. The management and outcome of patients with pulmonary fibrosis (ILD) has improved in recent years. The aim of this study was to review all patients attending this District General Hospital (DGH) and identify the morbidity of the population locally with ILD. A data base of all patients attending this DGH was established by Spring 2019. Age at diagnosis, sex, radiological sub type of fibrosis, the use of anti fibrotic agents and requirement for oxygen was all recorded. There are 127 patients with a diagnosis of ILD attending this DGH in June 2019., 71 male. Age at diagnosis varied from 47-92, mean 77. Duration of follow up has varied from months to 13 years. 109 patients have been discussed at an ILD Xray meeting, 69 have been classified as having UIP, 16 connective tissue related fibrosis. 41 patients are on oxygen, 29 of these are on ambulatory oxygen, 11 are on long term oxygen therapy (LTOT). Twenty-five patients are on anti-fibrotic drugs as per NICE guidelines. This study shows that the patients with ILD are very diverse in both age and disability. This information will help us plan future care of these patients more effectively. We will be able to identify those patients who require more regular and intensive follow up. A specialised interstitial lung disease clinic was established in Beaumont hospital in April 2018. Since then approximately 104 new patients have been seen in this clinic. All patients attending the service were discussed at a specialised multidisciplinary meeting. Of these, 60 were identified as having idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The cohort was predominantly male, with 38 men and 22 women attending the service, and median age of 74.5 years.

The incidence of sarcoidosis in patients with testicular cancer is higher than in the general population (1) . The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of sarcoidosis in patients with testicular cancer in a tertiary referral centre in Ireland between 2005 and 2018. A retrospective review was carried out to identify male patients with a diagnosis of testicular cancer and sarcoidosis seen in a tertiary referral centre in Ireland between 2005 and 2018. 12 cases were identified. The average age of diagnosis of testicular cancer was 36 years. Nine patients had stage one disease, 1 had stage two and 2 had stage three at diagnosis. All underwent surgical resection (orchidectomy). In 75% (9/12), the histological subtype was pure seminoma. All cases of sarcoidosis were diagnosed after diagnosis of testicular cancer. Six patients had tissue confirmation of sarcoidosis, the remainder were diagnosed following MDT discussion. 11 patients had Siltzbach stage one sarcoidosis at presentation and 1 patient had stage two sarcoidosis. The estimated cumulative incidence of sarcoidosis amongst patients with testicular cancer was 6185.6 per 100,000 patients. The observed incidence of sarcoidosis showed an over 200 fold increase in patients with testicular tumours compared with general population in Ireland. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder with a high prevalence in the Irish population. Diagnosis is made with transbronchial/ endobronchial biopsy (parenchymal lung disease) or EBUS (lymph node predominant disease), with a hallmark of noncaseating granulomata. However it is recommended Immunoglobulin levels are checked, to exclude a diagnosis of Combined Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID).The purpose of this study was to assess compliance to testing immunoglobulin levels in patients made with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. We reviewed the charts and blood results of 34 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis over a four year period. All 34 were confirmed as having non-caseating granulomata at either EBUS or parenchymal lung biopsy. 13 patients (38%) did not have immunoglobulin levels checked at diagnosis. For follow up, 2 of these patients had emigrated, and of the remaining 11 patients, 1 patient had an abnormal immunoglobulin profile and was diagnosed with CVID. He was male, aged 26, had suffered from intermittent chest infections and had been referred with dyspnoea and parenchymal lung changes on chest xray. This study highlights the importance of routinely checking immunoglobulin levels to assess for CVID in patients diagnosed with a granulomatous lung disease.

IPPC is defined by the absence of serological or histological evidence of systemic disease.(1) Due to its rarity there are no RCTs for treatment. Management has centred on immunosuppression with corticosteroids and steroid sparing agents like cyclophosphamide. There is no known rescue therapy for patients unresponsive to above mainstay treatments. (2) We present two cases of IPPC which have maintained remission with rituximab therapy following recurrent DAH on standard immunosuppression. These cases suggest that rituximab can be considered as an alternative therapy for refractory IPPC.

A Re-Audit Post Intervention O'Toole, P., Martin R., and Mc Donnell T.J. St Michaels Hospital, DunlaoghaireIntroduction: Patients with respiratory disease frequently require oxygen administered using low flow oxygen. Many centres utilise humidified oxygen with 'bubble bottles', although supporting data is limited. Guidelines advise against the use of humidification during low-flow oxygen therapy in non-intubated patients due to minimal benefit and risk of infection.1,2 An audit was carried out in 2018 that showed humidification of low flow O2 in St. Michaels Hospital (SMH) was common practice. Methods: In May 2019 hospital staff were educated on the current guidelines for the humidification of oxygen. Humidification bubble bottles were then removed from the hospital store rooms. A re-audit was then carried out on the use of humidification post the intervention. Results: In August 2019, 38 patients were observed to have low flow oxygen applied (<4litres). 100% of these patients had no humidification added to their oxygen. Conclusion: Our audit shows that SMH is now compliant with oxygen guidelines and is now not routinely using humidification for low flow oxygen. It has been estimated that this will save the hospital approximately \u20ac6900 per annum.References 1. O' Driscoll BR, Howard LS, Earis J, Mak V.

The Asthma Society of Ireland inhaler technique review-metered dose inhaler 10 point checklist was utilized in the survey. Ten staff members were assessed pre and post a brief educational intervention. Their confidence in educating patients in inhaler technique was also clarified during both the pre and post-education survey. The pre-education survey demonstrates staff performing within a range of 3 to 10 out of 10 steps correctly. The post-education survey demonstrates staff performing 10 out of 10 steps correctly. Seven staff members stated that they were confident in their ability to educate patients during the preeducation survey and ten staff members expressed confidence in their ability to educate patients in the correct pMDI inhaler technique during the post-education survey.

The aim is to break/manage the breathlessness/anxiety cycle by embracing concepts of wellness with relevant evidence based health indicators in line with the Healthy Ireland Framework (DOH 2013, GOLD 2019, HSE 2016). The underpinning health promotion model for this brochure is based on the trans-theoretical model of behaviour change, which provides resources and encourages self-empowerment and self-belief in one's ability to evoke positive behaviour change, albeit on a gradual basis (Baffour & Chonody 2012). COPD patients who participate in self-management may find it has a positive impact on their breathlessness/anxiety cycle, quality of life and a reduction on hospital admissions (Zwerinek, 2014 et al).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF29": {"text": "10.12 What is the impact of an outreach service on medication compliance for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease patients?

KildareAppropriate and timely use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the setting of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure bodes well for patients with such presentation1. We assessed compliance with BTS guidelines, thus assessing: the timing of NIV initiation; response to NIV using arterial blood gas (ABG); and pre-established decisions regarding escalation of care. A retrospective review of medical notes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and commenced on NIV was conducted. Twenty patients were commenced on NIV. The average time between triage and commencement of NIV was 5-hours. Of the 20 patients: in 60% (n=12) ABG was not analyzed within 1-2 hours following initiation of NIV; in 70% (n=14) oxygen saturation was maintained between 82-92%; respiratory specialist review was not undertaken in 75% (n=15) and ceiling of care/planned escalation decision was not documented in 65% (n=13) of the cohort. The results of the audit indicate that there is poor compliance with guidelines in monitoring NIV. Delays in initiating NIV and assessing response to NIV is not acceptable and hence ongoing NIV education to junior staff is critical to ensure provision of good quality NIV to COPD patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.1.

RCSI, Dublin, Ireland, Mayo University Hospital, Castlebar, Co. Mayo.No potential conflicts of interest to declare. Purpose: The role of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in reducing carbon dioxide levels in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) participants. Background: COPD is prevalent in Ireland. In severe or late stage disease gas transfer can be affected and hypercapnia develops. This can be a sign of poorer outcomes. The accepted treatment of choice for acidosis secondary to respiratory failure in COPD is non invasive ventilation (NIV). However there are no clear guidelines for those who have chronic hypercapnia. HFNC has been shown useful in many scenarios and in both chronic and acute conditions. However most of the research to date has been conducted on patients with mixed underlying diseases. Methods: This systematic review of all prospective studies has been designed to compare HFNC with conventional oxygen therapy (COT) on stable COPD patients. Results: The search yielded 7 studies with a total of 415 participants that met inclusion and exclusion criteria. HFNC reduced carbon dioxide levels significantly in 5 of the seven studies or in 355 participants in comparison to COT. No significant improvements were seen in respiratory rate of oxygenation with HFNC compared to COT. Conclusion: HFNC reduces CO2 levels when compared to COT in stable COPD participants. It has the potential to make improvements in chronic hypercapnic COPD patients as a potential treatment choice especially because it seems to be more tolerable than NIV. In conclusion, future research should concentrate on participants with severe COPD and hypercapnia to investigate the long-term improvements in respiratory status, exacerbation episodes and mortality with treatment of HFNC.4.15 Comparison of Spirometry results using the microlab and Air Smart spirometers in a cohort of COPD patients.The HRB funded CRF, University College Cork, Cork.Spirometry is used to diagnose and/or determine treatment response in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study we compared spirometric values (FEV1 and FVC) obtained with the hospital approved hand held/touch screen Microlab Spirometer (Carefusion UK 232) and the Air Smart Spirometer (Pond Healthcare), which connects to a smart phone and operated through an application. We recruited 15 patients with a previous diagnosis of COPD attending our COPD outreach programme in CUH over a 6 month period. Patients had spirometry performed using both devices and the results analysed. Two patients were unable to perform spirometry with the Air Smart device and were excluded from the final analysis.The tests were compared using the Bland-Altman plot. Results showed a wide variance in both percentage FEV1 and percentage FVC predicted. FEV1 mean bias +3 [(95% CI= -1 to +6.5), absolute range -9 to +27]. FVC mean bias -0.2 [(95% CI=-9 to +10), absolute range -25 to +24]. There was therefore a wide variance in the values obtained, although the cohort was small. We believe that further studies would be required before the Air Smart spirometer could be routinely utilized in clinical practice in COPD.4.16 Review of the Irish Guidelines for Returning to Driving once Oxygen Dependent.

Large prospective data on long-term compliance with CPAP therapy are lacking in Ireland. Methods: This study is part of a systematic follow-up of our cohort participating in the European Sleep Apnoea Database (ESADA) project1. 1,452 participants were interviewed by phone about death and cardiovascular events since baseline along with data on CPAP or alternative treatment. Medical records and objective compliance data were utilized to verify responses where possible. Results: Follow-up was completed by 1,289 patients. 663 (51%; 50\u00b112 years, BMI 35.5\u00b18.0, 75% male, AHI: 34\u00b125) were initiated on CPAP. Of those, 523 (79%) adhered to treatment after 6 weeks and 386 (58%) long-term (median duration 7 years). Logistic regression analysis identified the duration of treatment and the presence of short-term compliance as independent predictors of long-term adherence. Oral devices were used by 43 pts and 48 subjects had upper airway surgery, subjective success was reported in 44% and 85%, respectively. Conclusion: Long-term CPAP compliance of our service is comparable to internationally-reported data and predicted by shortterm usage. Alternative treatment options are poorly utilized. An Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)Telemedicine Clinic has been established in Mallow General Hospital (MGH)This is a quality initiative to improve the service delivered to our current service users but also to reduce the waiting list for potential new service usersC Hanlon, M Osborne, J Kiely, D O Donovan Department of Sleep Medicine, Mallow General Hospital, Mallow, Co. Cork A quality initiative for OSA patients via telemedicine was launched in January 2018 in response to a growing waiting list.There are currently 160 patients recruited onto the service.These patients have had their follow up appointments removed from the OPD sleep clinic and transferred to the telemedicine clinic. To qualify the patient must undergo an inclusion/exclusion assessment and must be established on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. It is a highly attractive option for patients traveling long distances or taking days off work to attend appointments. It involves obtaining an up to date download from the patients CPAP supplier and a phone call from the Respiratory Nurse. The authors examined a random cohort of 50 telemedicine patients to include gender, age at diagnosis, weight, severity of OSA and mask type used. A comparison was made between CPAP hours and the Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) on first visit post diagnosis and the most recent clinic visit. It was found that this group of patients had a mean age of 55 and a mean ApnoeaHypopnoea Index (AHI) of 47. Compliance in this group was at a level of 80.1 % on first follow up visit and rose to 91.4% subsequently. An average ESS of 10 decreased to 3 post treatment Studying telemedicine patients in this way allows the authors to form a better understanding of compliance and the factors that promote it.1.Koehler M,Smith D,Tipper V,Strading J. Predictors of long term Evaluation of Cardiovascular risk in sleep apnea patients with use of Carotid Duplex and Elastography. Hilliard T.L, McEvoy K, .Mc.Gowan A, Dooley C, Dolan E, Cormican L. Vascular Diagnostic Department. Respiratory and Sleep Department. Connolly Hospital, Dublin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) 1. The aim of this study was to evaluate this risk by examining the carotid arteries of patients referred for diagnostic Polysonography (PSG). Carotid Duplex and Elastography assessed the arterial health markers; Intimal medial thickening (IMTcm), plaque score (PS), Common Carotid Diameter (CCADcm), flow resistance index (RI) and elasticity modulus (Memean, KPa) a marker of arterial stiffness2.Increasing values of these markers suggest an increase risk of CVD. Patients, (n=28, 14F, 14M), were randomly invited to participate via mail. Carotid Duplex was performed blinded to PSG results. Patients with significant vascular disease (>30%stenosis) were referred for vascular consult (n=5, 17%). Results were divided into groups of sleep apnoea severity (increasing Apnea-Hypopnea Index). Further sleep parameters and bloods were analysed. Increasing IMT, PS, CCAD and elasticity modulus evident with increasing AHI levels,Table 1.0. Positive correlation between AHI and IMT, CCAD, (r=.56, r=.61). Obstructive Apnoea Index correlated strongly with elasticity modulus while AHI, Central Apnoea Index and Oxygen Desaturation (ODI) Index did not. This pilot study supports an OSA-CVD link. Further data analysis will be conducted to aid a targeted approach to aid early CVD prevention in OSA patients.Table 1.0 References; 1. Floras JS.

We aimed to see whether patients attending for bariatric surgery slept for shorter periods than that seen in published international surveys. We analysed data from 218 patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the Bon Secours Hospital, Cork. Data collected included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Patients were categorised into pre-operative, postoperative and CPAP therapy status. Self-reported sleep duration was compared to available international sleep data. Of the 218 patients, 157 patients (71.63%) were pre-bariatric surgery and not on positive airway pressure therapy. The average (standard deviation) age was 45.7(11.3) years, Body Mass Index 48(8.4) kg/m2 and 71.1% were female. The average duration of sleep was 6 hours and 45 minutes. Sleep quality was rated as \"fairly good\" in a significant minority (46.15%) with only 6.41% of participants reporting as \"very bad\". Less than 63% met the criteria of adequate sleep as per the National SleepFoundation. Despite higher baseline body mass index, bariatric patients had a comparable average sleep duration with published values in national surveys. This result does not take into account sleep quality or presence of sleep disorders such as Obstructive Sleep Apnoea. 5.5 Delivery of a Nurse Led Respiratory Service in a Model 2 Hospital with Governance from a Model 3 Hospital N. Fallon, H. McLoughlin Roscommon University Hospital and Portiuncula University Hospital Historically, a large cohort of patients existed within the service at Roscommon Hospital being treated for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) on CPAP/BIPAP. The management of sleep disorders such as OSA can be difficult and requires detailed assessment and management in order to provide the highest standard of care. A gap in service was identified; the delivery of a nurse led respiratory service required the governance and expertise of a Consultant in Respiratory Medicine. The Practice Guidelines for Standards of Adult Sleep Medicines Services1concludes that the prevalence, complexity and immense individual and public health burden of sleep disorders require the need for adequately trained personnel, facilities, equipment and procedures. The Respiratory Consultant in the neighbouring Model 3 hospital facilitated a pathway between the two hospitals allowing for direct referral from the Respiratory Nurse to the Respiratory Consultant. This allowed access for patients to a sleep dedicated facility in line with best practice guidelines. As the service has evolved it has extended to virtual consultations, fast tracking of urgent outpatients to the respiratory clinic and the smooth transfer of deteriorating patients, with in excess of 460 patients benefiting. Development of an Advanced Nurse Practitioner role in the Model 2 Hospital would provide opportunities to further develop the service ensuring strong governance in order to ensure optimal care.

McEvoy, A. McGowan, L. Cormican, J. Faul Respiratory & Sleep Diagnostics, Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15CPAP is a common treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea. Patients often struggle with this treatment for a variety of different reasons and so require follow up to ensure appropriate usage (adherence). CPAP compliance is usage on >70% nights; adherence is usage for >4 hours on >70 percent of available nights. This difference is importantpatients may attempt usage on more than 70% of nights but may not be benefiting from it because they are not using it appropriately. A dedicated physiologist CPAP review clinic was established in Connolly Hospital in 2016. Adherence rates for CPAP were 51% prior to this (n=466).The aims and objectives of the CPAP clinic were & A clinic purely focused on management of CPAP. Adjustments to therapy can be made immediately & Continuity of care with same physiologist at each visit giving a familiarity for the patient.& Provide an easily accessible point of contact and increase adherence to CPAP treatmentWith increased support 58% of these patients are now properly adherent to CPAP. This increases to 70% in those with multiple visits and thus more intervention and help (n=77). Therefore the support structure offered by a dedicated CPAP review clinic has increased appropriate usage and successfully provided better outcomes for CPAP patients 5.7 Outcome of a CPAP Review project in the Western TrustS Marks, K Harper, H Phelan, C Gilliland, D Clifford, RA Sharkey. Dept. of Respiratory Medicine, Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry, BT47 6SB Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). According to IMPRESS (2009), following control of OSA with CPAP, patients should be reviewed periodically (e.g. annually) with monitoring of compliance, symptom control, potential side effects and potential ventilatory failure. Due to a lack of staffing resources, the monitoring of patients on CPAP was not taking place. A CPAP review project was financed resulting in the review of patients on CPAP prior to and including 2016 within the Northern Sector of the WHSCT. The project ran in 2 phases (December 2016 -April 2017 & April 2018 -November 2018). 959 clinic reviews were appointed. 566 patients attended while 258 did not attend (DNA) and 138 could not attend (CNA). 264 patients were reviewed remotely. 315 patients returned their machines. Reasons for ceasing CPAP rentals This project highlights the importance of the review of patients on CPAP and the potential to make savings and so allow the funding of CPAP for other appropriate patients.

A retrospective review of their implementation at Cork University Hospital for use in transbronchial cryobiopsy under conscious sedation.Deasy KF 1 , Walsh LJ 1 , Henry MT 1Department of Respiratory Medicine, Cork University HospitalAbstract Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is a promising new technique that is rapidly developing as a standard diagnostic procedure in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease 1 . However there continues to be a variety of non-standardised approaches taken to its implementation 2 . We performed a retrospective study of patients undergoing TBLC using flexible bronchoscopy under conscious sedation (CS) in Cork University Hospital over the calendar years 2017-2018; with a transition to the use of endobronchial balloon blockers (EBB) in 2018.Pneumothorax was associated with an increased biopsy rate (p=0.017). EBB subjects had significantly less moderate or severe airway bleeding (8.3% vs 38.5%) despite increased mean biopsy rate (p=0.03). No severe airway bleeding occurred in the EBB group. EBB improve patient safety in patients undergoing TBLC. Cork University Hospital is novel in using EBB as standard during TBLC under CS. EBB enhances the safety profile of offering this procedure under CS and did not appear to impact patient comfort.References 1.Ravaglia C, Wells AU, Tomassetti S, et al.

SB Barrett, EM O'Dwyer, SA Ahern, BP Philip, KD Doddakula Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Cork University Hospital, CorkVideo-Assisted-Thoracoscopic-Surgery(VATs) lobectomy is an established technique for the management of primary lung malignancies. In comparison to open thoracotomy, it has been associated with shorter hospitalisation time, lower complications incidence, and better 5-year survival outcomes.1  It has been shown that open thoracotomy may achieve superior mediastinal lymph node dissection 2 , but the literature remains inconclusive. Our aim is to compare open thoracotomy versus VATS with regard to the completeness of lymph node dissection. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing VATS and open thoracotomy for the treatment of primary lung malignancies over a 2 year period. Patients were matched according to gender, age, and clinical tumour stage. We compared the total number of lymph nodes dissected, and the number of N1 and N2 lymph node stations sampled in the different groups. Our data showed that there is no significant difference between VATS and open thoracotomy in terms of the completeness of lymph node dissection in patients being treated for primary lung malignancies. Our study is limited by its retrospective nature. Further large scale, high quality randomised controlled trials are needed to definitively answer the question proposed.References 13.2 Pleural thickness as predictor of successful pleurodesis in malignant pleural effusions W.Binalialsharabi, D.

We show for the first time that alterations in CF neutrophil immunometabolism drive pro-inflammatory cytokine release by these cells, an effect that correlates closely with clinical outcomes and can be abrogated by a specific small molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The data show that these immunometabolic changes stem from chronic inflammation rather than an intrinsic CFTR defect and as such may occur even in the presence of effective CFTR modulation. The aim of this study was explore how idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients are catered for within pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) services. A study specific online survey was developed. The survey was circulated to 27 PR sites in Ireland. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data and open ended questions were analysed using thematic analysis.

However, little is known about these patients' clinical presentation or progression and there is no data available on what type of mutations are prevalent in Ireland. We hypothesise that understanding the types of clinical presentation and progression which characterise familial-pulmonary-fibrosis may improve diagnosis and reduce clinical risk to patients. Telomerase and surfactant related mutations, [1] and genetic syndromes including Hermansky-Pudlack syndrome are associated with familialpulmonary-fibrosis [2] . Since establishing a specialised interstitial lung disease service in 2018 in Beaumont Hospital, 10 (17%) of 60 patients with IPF have a documented family history of pulmonary-fibrosis, including one with an identified genetic cause for his pulmonary fibrosis. Of these 10 patients, 6 were men and with a median age of 71 years. All had radiological imaging consistent with UIP (usual interstitial pneumonia), with three patients having undergone lung biopsies. Seven identified patients were ex-smokers. The average DLCO for these patients at referral was 30%, compared to 50% in the overall sporadic-IPF cohort. All were offered anti-fibrotic therapy and 3 were referred for lung transplant assessment. References: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with significant mortality and it is essential to understand the natural progression of this condition. The project aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of an Irish IPF population. Data was retrieved from St. Vincent's University Hospital ILD registry for 87 IPF patients enrolled from 2009-2017 and 202 patient/ physician encounters in the ILD clinic were assessed prospectively. Mean age of diagnosis was 69 years and the prominent symptoms were dyspnoea (72%, n=52) and cough (60%, n=43). 37% of all patients had undergone lung biopsy, however, this decreased from 39% prior to 2013 to 30% between 2013-2017. The annual rates of decline for FVC and DLCO were 114ml\u00b1157ml and 7%\u00b17.7%, respectively. Of 202 physician encounters, 49% (n=99) did not document cough as a queried symptom or its absence. Leicester cough questionnaire demonstrated that cough was not particularly impactful on quality of life in this population (mean LCQ 16/21). IPF is a progressive lung disease, cough is a common presenting symptom, however in this group it appears to be poorly correlated with quality of life. To better understand the importance of cough, it is important to address it in all consultations. Robotic lobectomy is increasingly used to reduced post-operative pain while allowing flexibility in intra-operative technique. We reviewed the single surgeon experience of robotic Anatomical lung resection. All patients had lymph node dissection and Ro resection. This represents the learning curve in Robotic surgery for the surgeon. We assessed the duration of operation, duration of chest drain and duration of stay. We analysed time trends and relationships between the factors. 43 patients underwent anatomical lobectomy and lymph node dissection; Patients who had conversion to open thoracotomy were excluded. There was a wide distribution in the operative duration and the length of stay. While there was general trend with time towards shorter operations and length of stay statistical trends were obscured by outliers. In the second half of the series many patients were discharged on the second post-operative day. There were no in-hospital deaths and no major morbidity. Our study shows the learning curve for a new technique for anatomical lung resection. While there is improvement over time there is still wide variability in post op stay mainly due to airleak. For patients who have minimal airleak they are discharged earlier and with significantly less pain.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 11, "end": 12, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 619, "end": 622, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 729, "end": 732, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Emerging Importance of Familial-Pulmonary Fibrosis in Ireland"}, {"text": "13.5 Establishing a nurse-led long-term indwelling pleural catheter service: from insertion to discharge Long-term indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) insertion for palliation of patients with malignant pleural effusions had previously been carried out by the Thoracic surgical team. The demand quickly increased having clearly demonstrated good symptom control of both pain and breathlessness for this population. In addition to increasing demand these patients required ongoing clinical review and outpatient support. We determined that this need would be most appropriately implemented and delivered by a nurse-led service. The Thoracic ANP underwent training for insertion of IPCs, this included attainment of both theoretical and practical skills supported by a thoracic consultant surgeon. It was deemed necessary to complete a competency based programme which included wetlab training, observation and supervised insertion technique (over 20 cases). Currently the majority of IPC insertion for the East of Ireland is undertaken in our thoracic department, and since January 2018 86% of these are independently performed by the thoracic ANP. This has facilitated a day case procedure, reducing length of stay from 5 days to 4 hours. There have been no intra-procedure adverse events. It is a safe and cost saving initiative which has facilitated streamlining of peri and post procedural care for this population. Alpha 1 antitrypsin disease (AATD) is a genetic codominant condition and commonly causes severe lower lobe emphysema [1] . AATD is the 4th most common indication for lung transplantation [2] , however less invasive procedures like video assisted thoracoscopic (VAT) lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) are alternatives to transplant, especially since the National Emphysema Treatment trial. Due to the rare nature of this condition, few case reports exist on the Irish cohort. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective case review on three patients between 2016-2019 who underwent VAT LVRS at centres of excellence for thoracic surgery in Ireland. This paper reports on 3 patients with AATD who underwent LVRS, discussing preoperative and postoperative parameters such as pulmonary function tests and CT imaging. Improvements in post-operative PFTs were demonstrated in all patients (Table 1) . AATD induced COPD is a complex condition but LVRS is emerging as an additional option to medical therapy and transplantation for patients with end-stage emphysema. The above case series provides additional reporting of LVRS for a rare case of lung disease postoperative results were in keeping with NETT's conclusion that LVRS improves exercise capacity versus medical treatment alone for those with end stage emphysema. Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) blockade use has revolutionised the treatment of a host of auto-immune conditions world-wide. These include diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spodylarthropathies, and psoriasis among other conditions. TNF\u03b1 blockade however has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection. Tuberculous disease associated with TNF\u03b1 inhibition is often complex and more often disseminated involving multi-organs including the central nervous system. Furthermore, withdrawal of TNF\u03b1 blockade following TB diagnosis may lead to worsening symptoms due to the now commonly called 'paradoxical reactions' as the immune system reconstitutes.Within the wide scope of our TB specialty experience to date in St. James's Hospital (Ireland's Largest TB Specialist Tertiary Centre), we have been observing a concerning increase in TB and more worryingly drug resistant TB. Several of our cases of TNF\u03b1 associated TB have been either drugresistant or, alarmingly, multi-drug resistant TB. And for the first time we can report this in Irish-born national patients, without exposure by travel.To better understand the extent of this alarming problem and in future efforts to put strategies in place to eliminate or prevent its potential complications, we set out to perform a small observational study of multi-fold analysis.

In the Emergency Department (ED), the care pathway of suspected influenza patients can be complicated by the fact that 72 hours may elapse before the results of the gold standard test (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) becomes available. Thus, we conducted a survey to assess NCHDs attitude towards diagnosing influenza and beginning treatment with oseltamivir. Additionally, we directly compared anonymised data collected from patients admitted via the UCHG ED with a suspected influenza diagnosis to the data of patients diagnosed with non-influenza related LRTIs. The results showed that most medical NCHDs are reluctant to ask for an influenza swab in apprehension of untimely patient management. In the dataset, the average LOS and time to ward of patients with suspected influenza is delayed compared to other respiratory illnesses. Point of care (POC) diagnostic are equally specific to RT-PCR tests. Additionally, the pre-test probability can be increased via a clinical decision guideline questionnaire. Therefore, we propose the introduction POC diagnostic tests and an integrated care pathway for patients with clinically suspected influenza. Dedicated influenza wards may be the next step forward in improving bed management of seasonal influenza patients. Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. Empyema is a pathology of the pleural space in which purulent material accumulates in pleural space. It is often associated with pneumonia but can also be a ramification of lung carcinoma and immunosuppression status. Although radiological imaging is used to form a preliminary diagnosis, its true predictive value remains questionable. Microbiological and histopathological records of 43 patients undergoing decortication were included in this review. Only patients who were diagnosed with late stages of empyema and underwent decortication surgery were included in this study. The material obtained for the data was from Broncho-alveolar lavage, pleural fluid, and decorticated material (pleural/ lung tissue). The sample consisted of 43 patients-23 males and 20 females. For microbiology, 4.88% of BAL samples, 7.69% of tissue fluid samples, and 7.32% of pleural fluid samples were positive. For cytology/histopathology, 0.00% of BAL samples, and 5.41% of pleural fluid samples and 7.32% of tissue samples were positive.We recommend that, for the study and analysis of the microbiological samples, a myriad of all 3 different modalities of diagnosis is essential. However, tissue sampling is the preferred modality of diagnosis for cytology/histopathology owing to its ability to detecte positive cases that cannot otherwise be detected.14.9 A case series of yellow nail syndrome and a potential novel biomarker Micro-aspiration commonly occurs in health and its prevalence is increased in many lung diseases. A dysbiotic signature identified by enrichment with oral microbes is associated with increased inflammation and distinct metabolic profile in the lung microenvironment. 16S rRNA gene sequencing is commonly used for taxonomic annotation and inferred functional capacity. However, it is desirable to actually measure the function of these bacteria. We therefore took an approach that combines marker gene amplification, whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing (RNA) and measured metabolites. Upper (UA), lower airway (BAL), and background (BKG) samples were obtained via bronchoscopy from 19 healthy subjects. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to assess the microbiota and identify dysbiosis among lower airway samples. In parallel, functional microbial signatures were identified via WGS metagenome and RNA metatrascriptome sequencing. Dirichlet Multinomial Modelling identified two clusters from the 16S data where: 12 BAL samples clustered with BKG samples and were characterized as BAL.BPT (enriched with background characteristic taxa such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonadales) and 7 clustered with most UA samples and were characterized as BAL.SPT (enriched with oral commensals such as Veillonella and Streptococcus). Using Gene-Set-Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), there is very little overlap between the three sequencing methods for taxonomic annotation ( Figure 1A-F) . For functional annotation, in samples clustered to BAL.SPT, with WGS, most upregulated pathways are associated with Ribosome while with RNA a number of pathways are upregulated including lipid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. Comparing the differentially expressed pathways for BAL.SPT samples, between the three sequencing methods, some pathways share directionality and significance ( Figure 1H ,J,L). For example, fatty acid biosynthesis is significantly upregulated in all three sequencing methods. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were therefore measured. UA and BAL samples had significantly higher levels of acetate and propionate when compared to BKG samples. However, only with RNA, KOs associated to these SCFAs are significantly elevated in both UA and BAL Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for patients with chronic lung disease as protective measures against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia respectively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate documentation status of vaccine uptake in newly referred patients, and to review the actual uptake in these referred patients. Seventy three consecutive referrals were included in this study (54 female, mean age 64). Patients were predominantly smokers (59 of the 73 patients-81%). All patients had been referred due to dyspnoea, cough, or recurrent respiratory tract infections. Vaccine status was recorded in 58 of the 73 patients (79%). Of these 58 patients, 42 (72%) had received the influenza vaccine, and 23 had received the pneumococcal vaccine (40%). Vaccine status in 15 patients was undetermined. This study highlights the importance of adequate documentation of vaccine status in newly referred patients. It also highlights a lack of uptake of vaccines in patients with chronic lung disease symptoms prior to being seen in a respiratory clinic. Reasons given were lack of awareness of the need for vaccination, preferring to wait to be seen in clinic prior to receiving the vaccines, and fear of actually developing influenza or pneumonia from the vaccines.14.13 Air pollutants in urban and semi-rural locations Air pollution represents the greatest environmental threat to the global population, particularly for vulnerable groups e.g. patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Control of airborne xenobiotics within Britain is addressed by air monitoring strategies which identify pollutant levels. However, these do not provide a comprehensive overview of the pollution profile within an area. This study investigated metal composition within particulates, to enable source apportionment of contaminants, and detection of elements most influential to health impact. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy was used to analyse air samples obtained from urban and semi-rural locations. Metal contaminants identified in the environmental studies are then investigated in parallel cell culture studies on lung epithelial cells, to assess their effect on cell viability and cytokine release. Beryllium, iron and zinc were detected in samples derived from the urban site; sodium, potassium and magnesium as well as zinc and iron were detected from the semi-rural site. Cell cultures studies on these identified pollutants are now ongoing.Results from the environmental studies suggest rural pollutants likely originate from anthropogenic sources, whereas semi-rural pollutants may additionally derive from biogenic sources. Identifying the impact of these pollutants on cell function may help develop targeted approaches to improving air quality.14.14 A review of bronchial washings as an adjunct to bronchoscopy in testing for mycobacterial infection in University Hospital Limerick (UHL) Bronchial washings are an adjunct to bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of various pulmonary diseases, including primary or metastatic lung cancer and, infectious and non-infectious inflammatory lung disease. They may increase the diagnostic yield for this procedure. Bronchial washings testing for mycobacteria are routinely performed for all bronchoscopy cases in University Hospital Limerick (UHL). This is a review of the results of all bronchoscopies with bronchial washings performed over a six-month period, January to June 2019 that were tested for mycobacteria where there was a very low suspicion for mycobacterial infection in most cases. We assessed if acid-alcohol fast bacilli were seen on direct microscopy and if mycobacterium species were isolated on culture. A total of 598 bronchoscopies were performed in this period. 566 bronchoscopies with bronchial washings/bronchoalveolar lavage samples were received in the lab testing for mycobacterium. Two cultured mycobacterium tuberculosis but the suspicion was intermediate and high respectively in these cases. Six cultured atypical mycobacteria that didn't require treatment. See table. This review demonstrates that when there is a low suspicion for mycobacterial infection the additional yield in testing bronchial washings is negligible. Therefore, routine assessment of bronchial washings for mycobacteria is not indicated.
