In 2015, after a first meeting in Kirkland, USA, these experts delivered a call to action for a robust maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) measurement system that could effectively measure and monitor the coverage of high-impact healthcare while also improving capacity to track universal health coverage for women and children. 1 That call to action defined five principles.

And this may be exacerbated because the units of disaggregation can appear to be more academic than actionable. For example, categories of relative wealth, education and gender do not easily translate into action plans at local levels, since governments tend to allocate resources geographically, not to individual groups. Nonetheless, it is widely known BMJ Global Health that some population groups or some subnational areas are consistently left far behind their counterparts. 8 Clearly, data alone are insufficient to stimulate action.

The sector leads the field of universal health coverage and effective coverage measurement and has numerous lessons to share. But to be fit for 2030, indeed to be ready to face new challenges today, the real test lies in the transition from global to local actions that strengthen measurement systems. A transition that will result in more countries gaining from the power of data and that will ultimately be reflected by greater country-owned accountability for health.",
