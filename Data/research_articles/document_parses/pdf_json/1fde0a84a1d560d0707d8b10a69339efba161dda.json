Increased incidence of acute, painful acral edema was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was not associated with any other disease. The diagnosis of COVID-19 may be hindered by the diversity in symptoms at the time of presentation and the lack of accuracy of the available diagnostic tests at certain clinical stages. Skin COVID-19 expressions are becoming a common manifestation of the disease 2,3 and could provide extensive information. As far as we are concerned, acute acral edema related to COVID-19 has not been reported. Nevertheless, lung COVID-19 postmortem studies found inflammation and edema. 5 Moreover, skin living COVID-19 tissue analysis demonstrated an obliterative microangiopathy with increased vascular permeability. 4 This endothelial cell distortion generated vascular lumen obliteration and a strike erythrocyte and serum extravasation. 4 It could provoke a tissular conflict with the consequent associated numbness.",
