We derive a mean-field description that accurately captures the salient features of the model, most notably a phase transition between annual and biennial outbreaks. A numerical scaling analysis exhibits a diverging autocorrelation time in the thermodynamic limit, which confirms the presence of a classical discrete time crystalline phase. We derive the phase diagram of the model both from mean-field theory and from numerics. Our work offers new perspectives by demonstrating that small-worldness and non-Markovianity can stabilize a classical discrete time crystal, and by linking recent efforts to understand such dynamical phases of matter to the century-old problem of biennial epidemics.",

Naturally, understanding and preventing disease has always been of great interest, reflected in the correspondingly vast body of literature [2] . Pioneered in the early 20 th century [3] [4] [5] , a modern formulation of epidemic dynamics uses coupled ordinary differential equations for the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R) individuals. Among the many rich dynamical phenomena that can be captured by S(E)I(RS) models is the emergence of a subharmonic response to a periodic variation in parameters, given for example through seasonality. In particular, biennial outbreaks have been observed in real-world measles case data more than a century ago [3] . SIR models to reproduce this phenomenon therefore have been an early target for computer-aided simulations [6] . Indeed, such a behavior is not specific to measles, but also appears in other diseases such as croup (cf. Fig. 1 ). To this day, sophisticated versions of these models, accounting for factors such as seasonality, immunity, cross-immunity, and the effect of distancing measures, are used to model outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic [7] .",

This is more appropriately captured by probabilistic cellular automata on networks, where vertices (cells) represent individuals and edges potential infection pathways, which in recent years has shown great promise [8] . Among the key challenges is to understand the limits of the validity of global variables and to characterize phenomena that cannot be described otherwise. For example, the COVID-19 crisis has cast a spotlight on the shortcomings of using global variables to describe pandemics, which are both characterized by large spatial fluctuations and have fat tails [9] . A natural choice is to study infection dynamics on small-world [15] . A qualitatively similar behavior appears in our seasonal SIRS model on a small-world graph, in which the fraction of infected vertices pi also shows biennial major outbreaks (bottom, for \u03c6 = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , k = 2 and N = 10 6 ). On an abstract level, this subharmonic response breaks time-translation symmetry, which can be considered a crystalline phase in time (bar with alternating +\u2212, corresponding to major and minor outbreaks, respectively).",

To give an example of using such a description, SI(R) models on small-world graphs naturally predict the well-known phenomenon of herd immunity [10] . Using percolation theory, one can show that in small-world graphs there is a critical level of immunity above which no extensive connected cluster of susceptible vertices exists, precluding outbreaks [10] . Furthermore, small-world networks have the added benefit that they allow for analytic understanding in the large-system-size limit [13, 14] . The graph is constructed starting from a periodic one-dimensional lattice in which each vertex is connected to its 2k nearest neighbors. In a 'rewiring' procedure, with probability \u03c6, the ends of each short-range edge (dashed) can be moved to a random location in the graph, creating a shortcut. Each vertex is either susceptible (S, white), infected (I, black), or recovered (R, grey), that is, immune. Disease spreading occurs according to the shown three update rules, that are further detailed in the main text. (b) Phase diagram in the plane of the small-world parameter \u03c6 and winter duration Tw, comparing numerical results for N = 10 4 and k = 2 with the mean-field prediction. The trivial and DTC phases are characterized by annual or biennial outbreaks, respectively. We fit Tw = \u03b1\u03c6 \u03bd to the first eight and last eight values (dashed) and find (\u03b1, \u03bd) = (0.12 \u00b1 .01, \u22121 \u00b1 .01) and (.65 \u00b1 .02, \u2212.65 \u00b1 .01). The mean-field prediction (solid red) shows striking agreement with numerics for small \u03c6, but cannot explain the deviation at large \u03c6, which we attribute to a number of effects that are missed by mean-field theory, most notably the discreteness of space and time.",

The subharmonic response observed in structureless mean-field models is generally spoiled when moving to a network, where noise tends to randomize the phase of the response and to ultimately destroy any system's autocorrelation with its far past. Against this expectation, a 'classical discrete time crystal' (DTC) is a dynamical phase of matter that maintains a persistent subharmonic response in the thermodynamic limit, in spite of noise and perturbations. DTCs have originally been studied in the context of quantum many-body localization [16] [17] [18] [19] and have in the last few years attracted a tremendous amount of interest [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .

With a scaling analysis, we show that in the thermodynamic limit, biennial outbreaks exhibit longrange order in time, heralded by a diverging autocorrelation time. We attribute the robustness of the DTC to the interplay of small-worldness and, crucially, non-Markovianity. Our work links the well-known phenomena of biennial outbreaks to the theory of classical DTCs and thus unveils striking real-world ramifications of these remarkable dynamical phases of matter.",

As we will show later, these two behaviors constitute two genuine dynamical phases of matter: The phase with annual outbreaks preserves the time translation symmetry of the model, and can therefore be referred to as the 'trivial' phase. In contrast, if outbreaks occur biennially, the discrete time translation symmetry is broken, and the system enters the DTC phase. The phase diagram, derived analytically and confirmed numerically, is shown in Fig. 1d . Intuitively, the transition may be understood in terms of the effect of immune vertices. After a long winter (T w large) and/or a fast outbreak (\u03c6 large), in which a large proportion of vertices has been infected, the established herd immunity suppresses the outbreak in the following year. Two years later, the immunity has decayed, and a large outbreak occurs again. At the core of these effects is clearly the immunity, which prevents a given vertex to be infected for two consecutive years, a memory effect that we refer to as 'non-Markovianity'. Since the infection spreading is quicker on a smaller world, the critical \u03c6 c dividing the two phases decreases with the winter duration T w . We fit \u03b1\u03c6 \u03bd to the data (shown as dashed lines in Fig. 2b and obtain the critical exponents \u03bd = \u22121 \u00b1 .01 for small \u03c6, and \u03bd = .65 \u00b1 .01 for large \u03c6. At small \u03c6 the agreement with mean-field theory is striking, whereas for large \u03c6 the discreteness of the model plays an increasing role, which cannot be accounted for by mean field.",

This discounts the effect that clusters of immune sites may stop infection fronts, and also enclose a susceptible cluster, preventing it from being infected. Indeed, the mean-field model does not account for any fluctuations or other random structure that may emerge, such as fluctuations in the number of initially infected vertices, the relative positioning that may or may not be conducive to fast outbreaks, the number of long-range links, the size of the connected cluster of the randomly sampled small-world graph, etc. Ultimately, the mean-field theory is validated by the good agreement with numerics, which is shown in the next Section.",

As in previous work [13] , the approximations made to derive the mean-field solution deteriorate at larger values of \u03c6, which explains the deviation.

(b) Epidemics over multiple years can have two qualitatively very different behaviors. For \u03c6 < \u03c6c (left) and \u03c6 > \u03c6c (right), outbreaks occur annually and biennially, respectively. In the latter case, corresponding to a small-enough-world, the system responds with a period twice that of the underlying seasonality, pointing to a DTC.

If \u03c6 < \u03c6c, x2 is stable and the end-of-winter infected fraction p (n) i eventually reaches x2. On the contrary, if \u03c6 > \u03c6c, x2 becomes unstable and p (n) i eventually oscillates at every year between x1 and x3, the emerging stable FPs of the two-year map f (2) .

Surprisingly, the subharmonic response of the stochastic dynamical system is stable in the thermodynamic limit against noise and perturbations, and we Previous research highlighted that classical DTCs are typically prevented by deconfined domain walls in short-range 1d models [26] , but can be stabilized by either larger dimensionality [30] or long-range interactions [27] . These works also show how the essential features of classical DTCs can be captured by probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) [26, 27] , in which the system is described by two-state variables. This raises the more general question which aspects (dimensionality, range of interactions, contractive dynamics,..) of these models is responible for stabilizing the time crystalline phase. In this context, on the one hand our work explores small-world graphs, in which a few random links shortcut across a 1d chain, accounting for the small-world property of real-world social networks. On the other hand, a crucial role is played by immunity, which could equivalently be understood as a non-Markovian memory effect that precludes a vertex from being infected two years in a row. Our work therefore identifies non-Markovianity and small-worldness as two key ingredients that can stabilize timecrystallinity against the proliferation of noise-induced defects.",

            "text": "We conclude outlining some possible directions for future research. First, it would be desirable to improve the mean-field theory further such that it accounts explicitly for the number \u03bd r of immune regions. Such a theory could start from differential equations analogous to Eqs. (2) and (3), but introducing the parameter \u03bd r would most likely come at the price of losing analytical solubility. Second, the model studied here is very simplistic compared to models used to forecast actual epidemics. Additional ingredients may reveal a richer phase diagram or novel phenomena. As a few examples, one could for instance consider the survival of the infection through the summer (rather than a random autumn exposure), account for different epidemic spreading rules in various regions of the network (e.g., as to mimic different seasonalities in the two hemispheres), include more states of the vertices (e.g., infected asymptomatic) or strains of virus, or account for randomized and/or longer immunity times, which could result in the emergence of n-DTCs with major outbreaks every n years. Interestingly, the last point relates to early work that argued that only n = 2 could produce a stable subharmonic response [31] , in contrast to what our work would suggest. A particularly timely avenue is to investigate the effects of periodic interventions (such as an intermittent reduction of \u03c6 as to mimic travel restrictions), and whether these can lead to a subharmonic response, too. Third, more complex, multistate variable models support even richer dynamics, such as the prime-numbered response in predator-prey models on 2d graphs [32] . While in our model the subharmonicity is set by the duration of immunity, this raises the possibility of time crystals in which the periodicity is generated dynamically.",

From each time trace, we extract the fraction of infected vertices at the end of each year. (b) These data are used to form histograms, which reveal either one (blue) or two (yelllow) peaks, corresponding to annual and biennial epidemics, respectively. Because of finite-size effects, close to the phase transition, fluctuations of the graphs mean that individual time traces can lie either in the trivial phase (blue) or in the DTC phase (yellow), which generates some uncertainty. (c) By majority vote we extract from the collection histograms whether a set of parameters corresponds to the trivial or the DTC phase. (d) From the classification (c) we estimate where the phase transition lies. The estimate is represented by a point in the phase diagram. (e) For the best estimate of mean and standard deviation associated to one set of parameters, we collect all associated data and fit one or two Gaussians, depending on the phase it lies in. (f) The computed mean and variance are shown as points with errors bars in the bifurcation diagram. (g) The stability of the time crystal is assessed by counting defects. (h) In the DTC phase the defect density decreases exponentially with system size, whereas in the trivial phase no change occurs with system size. (i) We show the exponents obtained from fitting exponentials as a function of winter duration Tw.",
