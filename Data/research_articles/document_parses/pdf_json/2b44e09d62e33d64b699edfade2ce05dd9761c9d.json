            "text": "Enhancement of secondary metabolites through elicitation in hairy root culture is a very effective method which is broadly used to simulate the stress responses in plants. Elicitors are compounds that induce plants to produce secondary metabolites at elevated levels and reduce the processing time required to achieve high product concentrations. Hairy root cultures are considered as an excellent alternative for the supply of pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites/bioactives, due to their inherent genetic and biochemical stability. Plant-based secondary metabolites are well accepted in India as well as other countries to cure even the serious medical problems. In this chapter, three medicinally important plants are discussed in which stress-based elicitation of secondary metabolites has been achieved in hairy root cultures. These three plants contain important secondary metabolites in their different parts. Glycyrrhizin found in Glycyrrhiza glabra plant is used as antiulcer, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, and anti-inflammatory. Glycyrrhizin is also effective against HIV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses. In Solanum plant, steroidal glycoalkaloids contain pharmaceutically important secondary metabolites. Solasodine, a major alkaloid of Solanum plant, is used as a contraceptive in different parts of the world. Ajmaline and ajmalicine are important root-specific indole alkaloids of Rauwolfia serpentina. Ajmalicine is useful in circulatory disorders, while ajmaline is principally known for its antiarrhythmic and antihypertensive activities. The main objective of this chapter is to provide knowledge in these plants regarding elicitation-based enhancement of valuable secondary metabolites in the form of research studies conducted till date (as per author's knowledge).",

Some secondary metabolites, such as essential oils and saponins, were produced by plants during long-term coevolution as a mechanism of defense response against pathogens (Du Fall and Solomon 2011; War et al. 2012) . The productions of enormous varieties of secondary metabolites in plants have a direct impact on plant fitness. These secondary metabolites are being used for various purposes, such as food ingredients, medical drugs, and starting materials for chemical industry, etc. (Zhao et al. 2013) . Consequently, pathogens and constituents of microbial cells, mainly the polysaccharide fractions or carbohydrates, can be used to stimulate the production of secondary metabolites in plant cell and tissue cultures (Zhao et al. 2005) . Due to tremendous medicinal properties, the demand for medicinal plants is constantly increasing due to which some of them are under threatened category also (Muthukumar et al. 2004) .",

These alkaloids are mainly present in root bark of the plant (Mehrotra et al. 2013) . R. serpentina L. is an evergreen shrub having woody, glabrous, and perennial habit with a maximum height of 60 cm. The leaves of the plants are elliptic to lanceolate or obovate in shape in whorls of three; roots are tuberous with pale brown cork (Deshmukh et al. 2012 ). This plant is commonly known as \"Sarpagandha,\" \"Chandrabhaga,\" snakeroot plant, Chotachand, Chandrika, Harkaya, etc. (Mallick et al. 2012) . It is a tropical plant belonging to family Apocynaceae. The roots and leaves of R. serpentina are of medicinal importance and catch the attention in the field of medicine because of the presence of secondary metabolites (Poonam and Mishra 2013) . In India, it has been used as a part of the Ayurvedic system for curing various ailments (Pant and Joshi 2008) . The roots of R. serpentina are used as a medication for treating insomnia, hypertension, mental agitation, gastrointestinal disorders, epilepsy, excitement, traumas, anxiety, excitement, sedative insomnia, schizophrenia, and insanity (Meena et al. 2009; Poonam and Mishra 2013) . According to Rajendran and Agarwal (2007) , fruits and seeds of this plant are used by ethnic tribes of Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu, India, for its medicinal or ethnobotanical properties. R. serpentina plant has been considered under endangered category by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) (Shetty et al. 2014 ). This plant contains abundant medicinal properties and strongly suffered from habitat distortion (Mehrotra et al. 2015) .",

Many natural factors such as climate, altitude, rainfall, etc. are responsible for the growth of plants, and these conditions also affect the contents of plant metabolites. Variation in geographical areas alters the level of secondary metabolites, and this information could be used for generating the special conditions to enhance the yield of bioactive compounds. Keeping this in mind, four different parts of Southern India were used to collect Rauwolfia samples for analyzing the reserpine level. Considerable variation in the concentration of reserpine has been recorded (Kumar et al. 2010) . Shetty et al. (2014) developed an efficient and reproducible method for the induction of callus and hairy roots from in vitro as well as in vivo explants of R. serpentina. Hairy roots were used for the large-scale production of secondary metabolites. Thin-layer chromatography results showed that the reserpine was present in in vivo and in vitro explants and callus and it can be enhanced through various methods. Further, hairy roots were induced from leaf explants, and these hairy roots would be utilized for large-scale production of secondary metabolites (Shetty et al. 2014) .",

The confirmation of the structures of the identified compounds was made through their accurate molecular formula determinations (Madhusudanan et al. 2008) . Harisaranraj et al. (2009) concentrated on the production of reserpine by elicitating embryogenic suspension cultures of R. serpentina through different concentrations (50-500 \u03bcM) of MJ. Reserpine content significantly increased by the effect of MJ, although the fresh weight, dry weight, and growth ratio of embryos were significantly decreased by increasing MJ concentrations. The highest yield was 7.3fold enhancements. Nurcahyani and Anggarwulan (2008) studied the effect of Cu 2+ on callus growth and reserpine synthesis of in vitro cultures of R. serpentina. The increase in reserpine production was observed at 5 and 10 \u03bcM concentration of Cu 2+ after 15 days of elicitation, although decrease in concentration was reported at higher concentration of Cu 2+ . An efficient transformation system for R. serpentina was established with A. rhizogenes strain LBA 9402.

In this regard, hairy root cultures of R. serpentina provide an ultimate alternative source for the production of these alkaloids (Goel et al. 2010) . Benjamin et al. (1993) also reported hairy roots induction with the use of A. rhizogenes strain ATCC 15834 from the leaf explants of R. serpentina (Goel et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2012; Sudha et al. 2003) . Different A. rhizogenes strains, i.e., SV4, LBA9402, and SV2, were evaluated for their transformation ability. Among them SV2 strain was found more competent for the induction of hairy roots in leaf explants of R. serpentina (Sarma et al. 1997) . ATCC 15834 strain of Agrobacterium was also exploited for their transformation ability regarding induction of hairy roots in R. micrantha (Sudha et al. 2003) . Madhusudanan et al. (2008) reported induction of hairy roots in leaf explants of R. serpentina using A4 strain. A novel compound, 3-epi-a-yohimbine, was reported from these hairy roots. Plantlet formation from high reserpine yielding hairy root lines of R. serpentina has also been reported (Mehrotra et al. 2013 ). The effect of biotic and abiotic elicitors on the production of important metabolites in hairy root cultures of R. serpentina was analyzed. Ajmalicine production could be stimulated up to 14.8-fold at 100 mM concentration of NaCl after 1 week of treatment. However, ajmaline concentration could only be increased up to 2.9-fold at 100 mg L \u22121 dose of mannan after 1 week of treatment (Srivastava et al. 2016 ).",

            "text": "Solanum khasianum was originated from India; stem and leaves of this bushy annual or short-lived perennial plant are packed with spines. Steroidal glycoalkaloids are abundant in Solanum genus. These alkaloids are used as the precursor for the synthesis of steroidal drugs. Solasodine is the aglycone moiety of glycoalkaloids. Solasodine can be easily converted to 16-dehydropregnenolone, which is a key intermediate in the synthesis of steroidal drugs, such as progesterone and cortisone. Due to the presence of these valuable alkaloids, in the traditional system of medicine, Solanum species are used for the treatment of several diseases as in liver diseases, in asthma, and in different kinds of inflammation (Patel and Krishnamurthy 2013) . Shilpha et al. (2015) used leaves of S. trilobatum L. for the establishment of hairy root cultures of the infection of A. rhizogenes. Various strains, like MTCC 2364, MTCC 532, and ATCC along with A4, were used in this study. An elicitation strategy was performed for enhancing the solasodine level in S. trilobatum. A hairy root line elicited with methyl jasmonate (4 M) for 2 weeks, a 1.9-fold and 6.5-fold enhanced production of solasodine (9.33 \u00b1 0.04 mg g \u22121 DW) was obtained in comparison to unelicited and nontransformed normal roots, respectively. Real-time PCR analysis was also performed for monitoring the expression level of HMG-CoA reductase during the first 2 weeks of elicitation. A significant enhancement was also observed in the total flavonoids (521.09 mg g \u22121 DE), total phenolics (150.42 mg g \u22121 DE), and radical scavenging activity (83.3%) at 4 M MJ concentration in comparison with control (Shilpha et al. 2015) .",

The amount of carotene and carotenoid lycopene was found lesser in waterstressed tomatoes but showed diverse responses after combined stress. Nematode stress was responsible for enhancement in flavonoid level, albeit with reduced yield, although the level of chlorogenic acid was positively affected by water stress, nematodes, and combined stress. Combined stress also enhanced sugar level. These results enlightened the utility of the combination of stress. An (2014) observed the effects of yeast extract (YE) and MeJA on the growth and solasodine production of S. hainanense cells. The results showed that various concentrations of MeJA (50-250 \u03bcM) and YE (1-4 g L \u22121 ) have different eliciting influences. The increase in solasodine concentration was observed through elicitation of 3 g L \u22121 of YE and 50 \u03bcM of MeJA at the initial stage of cell culture where the increase was 1.9-and 1.3-fold, respectively, over the non-elicited cells.

To conquer this difficulty, the combination of transgenic approach and elicitation techniques was used to increase the flavonoid production. cDNA encoding chalcone isomerase (chi) gene was overexpressed in hairy roots of G. uralensis Fisch. Subsequently, transgenic and wild cultures were elicited with PEG 8000 (2%) and yeast extract (YE) (0.1%), and the combination of these two elicitors is also used. Total flavonoids were extracted and measured. The obtained results demonstrated that the highest flavonoid was obtained in double-treated transgenic hairy roots (2.838 g 100 g \u22121 DW). The amount of flavonoid in wild-type hairy roots and the untreated transgenic hairy roots was 0.842 and 1.394 (g 100 g \u22121 DW), respectively. The enhanced accumulation of flavonoids was also correlated with the elevated level of chi transcripts and CHI activity; it confirmed the key role of chi in the flavonoid biosynthesis. This research verified that the combination of PEG8000-YE elicitation with metabolic engineering was an effective strategy to enhance the flavonoid production in hairy roots of G. uralensis Fisch (Zhang et al. 2009 ).",

The addition of Si markedly affected the G. uralensis growth in a combination of NaCl and PEG treatment. The addition of Si improved germination index, germination rate, seedling vitality index, and biomass under control and NaCl treatment. Si also increased radicle length under control, NaCl, and combination of NaCl and PEG treatment (NaCl-10% PEG), while under NaCl-20% PEG combination, it decreased some parameters such as radicle length, seedling vitality index, and germination parameters.

Control plants were treated with water. The glycyrrhizic acid content of roots was significantly increased in the plants which were treated in the month of June. The increase also occurred in the plants which were treated in July, but the effect was lesser in comparison to the plants treated in June. Auxin at 40 mg L \u22121 and gibberellin at 40 mg L \u22121 concentration significantly enhanced the accumulation of glycyrrhizic acid in G. uralensis roots. Methyl jasmonate at 100 and 25 mg L \u22121 in June and July, respectively, also significantly promoted glycyrrhizic acid content. Major active compositions, such as isoliquiritin, liquiritin, liquiritinapioside, and isoliquiritinapioside, were found positively correlated with glycyrrhizic acid content . Shabani et al. (2009) conducted an experiment in G. glabra and reported the maximum yield of glycyrrhizin which occurred at 2 mM MeJA concentration after 24-h treatment, in the form of 3.8-fold increase as compared to the control. Ahmed and Baig (2014) observed the effect of diverse biotic elicitors such as fungal extract prepared from Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum on cell cultures of Psoralea corylifolia L. Besides this, yeast extract and chitosan were also studied. Ninefold enhancements were reported in psoralen concentration in treated cells over control one after A. niger elicitation. Elicitation with P. notatum yeast extract and chitosan caused four-to sevenfold higher psoralen productions in contrast to control cells. Above all, extract of A. niger at 1.0% v/v increased the highest accumulation of psoralen in the cultured cells, i.e., 9850 \u03bcg g \u22121 DCW.",

The chemotypes were revealed by LC/UV-or LC/MS/MS-based quantitative analysis of 151 bioactive secondary metabolites, including 17 flavonoid glycosides, 24 saponins, and 110 free phenolic compounds. For the 76 homozygous samples, the three Glycyrrhiza species showed significant biosynthetic preferences, especially in coumarins, chalcones, isoflavones, and flavonols. In total, 27 species-specific chemical markers were discovered. The 19 hybrid samples indicated that hybridization could remarkably alter the chemical composition and that the male parent contributed more to the offspring than the female parent did. This is hitherto the largest-scale targeted secondary metabolomics study of medicinal plants and the first report on uniparental inheritance in plant secondary metabolism. The results are valuable for biosynthesis, inheritance, and quality control studies of licorice and other medicinal plants (Song et al. 2017 ).",
