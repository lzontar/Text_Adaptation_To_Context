Many commercial companies have developed diagnostic assays that are available for clinical testing in the USA, if authorized through the FDA's emergency use authorization (EUA) process. While most of the SARS-CoV-2 EUA assays for molecular detection must be performed in moderate-to high-complexity clinical laboratories, a few are authorized as point-of-care devices, such as the Abbott ID NOW. In addition to clinical laboratories, this assay can be performed by trained non-laboratory personnel in patient care settings such an Emergency Departments, physician's offices or pharmacies, potentially bringing diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 closer to the patient (1). Among the marketing information for this new assay, potential advantages include its reported sensitivity (stated limit of detection (LOD) of 125 genome equivalents/ml) and run time (detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as early as five minutes and a negative result in thirteen minutes). Also, the ID NOW may provide rapid molecular results either from direct testing of nasopharyngeal, nasal, or oropharyngeal swabs or testing of the viral transport media (VTM) from swabs placed in this fluid after collection (2) . To date, reported performance of the ID NOW SARS-CoV-2 assay in the peer-reviewed literature has been variable. the ID NOW as compared to an LDT reference method, ranging from 75-87% (3) (4) (5) (6) .",

While removing this specimen type is an important step to reducing false-negative results, this now presents a challenge to both laboratories and patient care settings in verifying assay performance prior to implementation (8) . Given that only the direct swab is acceptable, verification cannot be performed using residual or contrived samples that are readily available and commonly used for this purpose. Notably, the direct swab positive control included with the assay does not contain SARS-CoV-2 material and therefore cannot be used for either a target amplification control or for assay verification.

The test procedure requires multiple cartridge transfers and manipulations, which may be challenging for personnel not familiar with or accustomed to adhering to molecular techniques.",

            "text": "the instrument and testing area was performed by wiping with 20% bleach followed by 70% ethanol to prevent both instrument and specimen contamination. Assay manipulation, with regards to biosafety, was also an important consideration. One procedural step, swirling the specimen in an open shallow well, poses a biohazard risk during test set up, thus all testing was performed inside a BSC. This would be challenging or impossible for most nonlaboratory settings. Additionally, hands-on time to complete the assay was on average 7-9 minutes for positive samples and 15-16 minutes for negative samples. Given that a single device can only run one specimen at a time and the number of manipulations required, this assay would be limited in throughput for high volume testing, averaging only 3-4 test per hour.Assessment of the ID NOW using residual samples in VTM demonstrated that the assay performs well for strong and moderately positive samples but has a dramatic reduction in sensitivity for weakly positive samples, which supports findings by other published studies. The impact on sensitivity achieved by restricting the assay's use to direct swabs is not possible to assess in the laboratory setting. Therefore, sensitivity concerns, together with device workflow and biosafety mitigation, should be taken into consideration when planning for deployment of the test, and when testing is performed, in the non-laboratory setting, especially on patients with a low suspicion for COVID-19 disease.Author Credit StatementS.L.
