Misinformation has existed throughout history; however, with the rise of social media platformsTwitter, Facebook, Reddit, Weibo, microblogs, among othersits spread has transcended borders and significantly increased in both pace and audience (1) . Understanding the flow and spread of misinformation is a vital issue to reduce its negative impacts. Just as COVID-19 has now spread to millions worldwide, misinformation, ranging from pseudoscience to conspiracy, has also spread online at an alarming rate, stirring panic and causing confusion. In China, such panic and confusion have led to massive scrambling for fictitious \"cures,\" such as garlic and Shuanghuanglian, a traditional Chinese medicine. Misinformation is a complex and elusive concept to rigorously define, despite the growing volume and scope of research on this topic. Briefly, it refers to \"information considered incorrect based on the best available evidence from relevant experts at the time \" (2) . In the past decade, the explosion of social media has significantly increased the dissemination of misinformation pertaining to numerous topics, including health, politics, and entertainment. As a result, identifying and 2 combating health-related misinformation on social media has become a top concern of public health (3) . During the 2018-19 Ebola outbreak, more than 25 percent of people in DR Congo believed misinformation about the outbreak, which significantly impeded public adoption of preventive behavior (4) . Factors affecting one's response to misinformation are complex and varied. Social norms, as well as the compatibility between the misinformation and one's belief system, have a significant influence on one's acceptance of misinformation (5) . To date, the majority of research on misinformation has examined Western media platforms; however, Chinese social media constitutes a very significant market. Weibo hosts more than 556 million registered users, with 313 million considered active monthly, compared to 319 million on Twitter (6) . There are some differences when comparing Weibo and Twitter, however. Past research has found that Weibo demonstrates a different pattern of information dissemination than Twitter, though the two platforms are often viewed as comparable (7) . Twitter is more open to contestation and plural views, whereas Weibo is under stricter control and draconian censorship by the Chinese government (8) . Besides, compared to Twitter, the network connections on Weibo are more hierarchical because users tend to follow others at a similar or higher social level (6) . Considering the consequential impact of misinformation, it is vital to investigate the spread of misinformation in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Chinathe first country undergoing the massive infection and lockdownprovides a rich cultural context in which to investigate COVID-19 related misinformation.",

It should be 3 noted that the lockdown was around the time of the Spring Festival holiday-the most celebrated tradition in China. During this time, local residents and migrant workers return home for family reunions, generating the most significant human migration on the planet. As such, it is also the time when the government is on high alert to ensure social order. The approaching of the lunar-year festivity served to further amplify the abruptness of the lockdown measure, feeding public uncertainties about the seriousness of the virus.",

In response to this unprecedented policy, there was a surge of sensationalizing information reporting severe disruptions in Wuhan (e.g., gas stations within Wuhan had stopped operating) and similar policies in other cities in China (e.g., a lockdown in Hankou in Wuhan and Xinyang in Henan). On February 2, Nanshan Zhong, a wellrespected pulmonologist and advisor to the Chinese government, announced that COVID-19 might spread via fecal transmission (9) . After this, a spike of misinformation regarding possible modes of transmission, cures, and prevention methods occurred. For example, a number of false claims that the virus was spread through mosquitoes, flies, and through the sewer were posted.",

Meanwhile, we also observed manipulations of Nanshan Zhong's statement. Misrepresenting or manipulating an authoritative figure, is a well-known misinformation strategy (10) . Linking a credible/authoritative source to misinformation tends to amplify the believability of the untruth. For example, a piece of misinformation said that \"Nanshan Zhong's team found that the infection rate of COVID is higher on smokers than non-smokers.\" This is the intentional exploitation of a reputable source to gain legitimacy. Unfortunately, however, it confuses and serves to undermine the credibility of the true experts and authoritative institutions. This example highlights the importance of both the audience and social platforms of vetting the credibility of a claim by confirming the source of the news.",

Furthermore, both content features (e.g., a topic about crime typically is more sensational than other topics) and formal elements (e.g., using a colorful font is more sensational than plain font) have proven to contribute to sensationalism (Grabe et al., ",

However, information itself is not enough to accomplish this goal. Due to a lack of comprehensive scientific training of the public and even some news media, misunderstandings or inaccurate interpretations of scientific studies may intensify the fear and panic. As an example, we investigate the claim that Individuals are more likely to believe information with a logical narrative from a source they perceive to be credible (19) . Source credibility varies, and may even be related to what sort of media people use. A post that SHL was effective for inhibition of COVID-19 was endorsed by two credible news media outlets, both providing an abbreviated scientific explanation. However, due to a lack of understanding of science and the critical omission of a clear explanation by the media, many understood the report as claiming SHL to be an effective treatment for COVID- We categorize different types of cures and prevention into food, Chinese medicine, Western medicine, disinfection suppliers, daily necessities, and chemicals/germs. In the early stage of the epidemic, there was a large amount of misinformation mentioning home remedies. As time progressed, there was a shift towards Chinese medicine, especially in late January to early February, with Shuanghuanglian as a representative example. The patriotism and cultural preservation advanced by the Chinese government added to the ideas about the effectiveness of Chinese herb medicine for COVID-19. Throughout the epidemic there was constant misinformation regarding Western medicine; some were conventional medicines (e.g., aspirin and mucosolvan), and others were more recently approved or studied (e.g., oseltamivir and resveratrol). Interestingly, as the epidemic in China shifted into the containment stage in mid-March, the misinformation regarding cures and prevention almost completely disappeared. Accounts with a large number of posts are labeled by their account name. On January 31, 2020, Xin Hua Shi Dian, a party-owned publisher, cited this article and quoted: \"SIMM and Wuhan Institute of Virology had discovered that SHL herbal remedy could \"inhibit\" 2019-nCov\", and mentioned that SHL is currently under clinical trial in hospitals in Shanghai and Wuhan. Nine minutes later, People's Daily, with 1.1 billion followers, endorsed the same news. Four hours later, Ding Xiang Doctor, an online community for physicians, raised the concern that such news will cause a shortage, and therefore people should not use it for prevention. Four hours later, a personal account with 2.7 million followers, shared an ironic post, which is surprisingly more accessible than many other accounts with more followers (e.g., Li Shi Pin, which has nine times more followers). This account held negative opinions about Chinese medicine and specifically satirized about a person's daily life with seven types of Chinese herb medicine. Six hours later, Scientific China, a science account with 3.5 million followers, shared the post with a catchy title, asking whether SHL can inhibit novel Coronavirus. SHL soon went viral on Weibo.",

            "text": "2001). From a linguistic angle, Molek-Kozakowska (2013) identified a range of pragmatic devices that may arouse audiences' sensational feelings. Dubbed as sensational illocutions, the methods include exposing (e.g., denouncing a crime), speculating (suggesting future consequences), generalizing (extrapolating to a larger population), warning (generating anxiety) and extolling (extraordinary facts/events/individuals). Integrating the perspectives mentioned above on content, form, and pragmatics about sensationalism, the researchers followed the typical procedure for content analysis. They classified the misinformation into five categories, with a final intercoder agreement of .94. InFigure 1e, the categories of misinformation comprise exposing virus (e.d., the origin of the virus), extraordinary incidence (e.g., infected celebrity), warning of risk severity (e.g., relapse), conflict/conspiracy (e.g., biological warfare), speculating hard life (e.g., lockdowns). Take the category of exposing viruses as an example: several posts mentioned unknown virus sources, stories of diagnosed patients fleeing quarantine, or claims that one patient infected a large number of others. Anxiety and emotions may also be entangled with false claims of lockdowns of different cities, expressways, and even at gas stations.",

On January 31, 2020, the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica (SIMM, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the Wuhan Institute of Virology had discovered that SHL herbal remedy could \"inhibit\" 2019-nCov (18). The study was based on a laboratory in vitro studies and required further clinical studies to confirm its effectiveness on humans. However, the crowd interpreted the research as 'SHL helps to prevent or cure coronavirus.' Misinterpreting the result in an environment of significant uncertainty contributed to a wave of panic-buying of SHL. The diffusion of SHL is shown inFigure 3a, which is especially interesting due to the polarized news and discussions, as revealed by the tags from the posts inFigure 3b. Specifically, the discussion revolves around the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of SHL. In response to the panic-buying of the crowd, there is a caveat against such behavior.",

            "text": "bating misinformation in a massive public health crisis. As Lewandowsky et al. commented, debunking misinformation merely from a science communication perspective may not be sufficient to mitigate the adverse effects(25). Instead, incorporating cultural, political, and social ingredients into the process of protecting the public from the threat of misinformation can yield superior outcomes. In a time of an infectious disease crisis, people are more likely to believe in unproven cures such as Shuanghuanglian. Social media amplifies emotional messages and responses; the platforms themselves contribute to fast and unthinking responses, thus increasing the possibilities that misinformation will circulate widely. Seemingly naive beliefs, such as the efficacy of traditional herbal medicine, even without rigorous scientific evidence, may give residents feelings of security and control. Sometimes, such misinformation about unproven cures can be perpetuated by governments and other stakeholders. As noted earlier, Donald Trump has repeatedly recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine-a yet unproven treatment for COVID-19 which has well known potential risks. Meanwhile, the cacophony of different stakeholders may crowd out the authoritative opinions of legitimate experts. Therefore, only when the public, politicians, media, and other stakeholders are well informed and genuinely concerned with the 13 public good, can they together push public discourses closer to the truth. The Shuanghuanglian case also speaks to the impact that a lack of consensus in the science community may have on the general public. When multiple sources report conflicting information, it can be difficult for the layperson to sort out truth from fiction. When and how to convey expert disputes to the public is a practical and meaningful question. Notably, during a pandemic crisis, the timing and amount of publicizing information about expert disputes warrant more attention and research.Finally, our results also raise questions about the responsibilities of the different components in the media ecosystem in responding to infodemics. People using social media, the scientific community is attempting to provide accurate and timely information, governments attempting to productively intervene in a crisis, and platforms that carry and algorithmically manipulate the messages all have essential roles in combating disasters, rumors, and damaging effects of misinformation. It would be valuable for future research to investigate how any potential patternsor cycles of misinformation vary across disasters, especially pandemics of emerging infectious diseases. Wu et al. (2016), analyzing Ebola-related rumors on microblogs in China, found that rumors tend to be related to real events associated with the virus. Specifically, rumors seem to concentrate on the source of the virus, fear about the virus, preventive measures, among others. Such a finding is, in general, consistent with that of the present study. Considering the nature of emerging infectious diseases, representative topics-such as a source of the pathogen, detection, and prevention-are more likely to generate misinformation. Future research should also look at how misinformation about pandemics differs from other crises such as earthquakes and political unrest. More concretely, it would be enlightening to compare types of rumors across different disasters or infodemics. Is there a typical lifecycle to what people attend to at different phases of a crisis? Also, comparative research across countries would be valuable too. Consider what is going on in the U.S. where a seeming lockdown is going on, but it is more voluntary (monetary fines being a penalty, for example) than in China. Such a comparison reflects the role of the State, extending into more important questions about democracy and the struggle with individual rights v. collective good. Research along this line will inform worldwide joint efforts to combat a pandemic like Covid-19 too.",
