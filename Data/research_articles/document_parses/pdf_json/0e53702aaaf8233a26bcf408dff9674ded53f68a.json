            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has caused a global pandemic that is severely straining health systems everywhere. 1 COVID-19 has an estimated symptomatic case fatality rate of approximately 1.4% which is around 15 times greater than that estimated for seasonal influenza. [2] [3] [4] The mortality rate rises dramatically for individuals with increasing age and comorbidities. 5 There are currently no proven or approved treatments for this disease, though numerous therapeutic agents are under investigation. The illness course is variable,: some individuals are asymptomatic, others experience a mild, self-resolving flu-like illness, and others still progress to moderate or severe disease. 6 For those who progress to more severe disease, there are typically four phases of the illness course, see Figure 1 . The first is the incubation period which lasts a median of 5.1 days, with a large range. 7 The second is a mild symptomatic phase which lasts around 5 days and typically includes flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, myalgias, and fatigue, though gastrointestinal symptoms like anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea as well as anosmia can be prominent. 1, 6 This is followed by progression to a hyperinflammatory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 8 The onset of this third phase is typically marked by dyspnea, tachypnea, and progressive, sometimes silent hypoxemia. This phase is marked by high fevers, elevated inflammatory markers, and the progressive formation of bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities on chest radiographs and associated respiratory failure. Some individuals develop multisystem organ failure with complications that can include micro and macro thromboses, myocarditis, elevated muscle enzymes suggestive of myositis, and kidney failure. [9] [10] [11] Because of the severity of the illness course in some cases of COVID-19, effective treatments are desperately needed. Unfortunately, few high quality randomized controlled treatment trials have been published to date for investigational agents for this disease. To date, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been widely used around the world for COVID-19 and previously for Ebola, H7N9 influenza and SARS virus infection, based on very limited data, review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.",

The first phase of COVID-19 infection involves an incubation period of variable duration, with a median of 5.1 days. The second is an acute mild phase that most commonly includes flu-like symptoms like cough, fevers, and myalgias, but can also include gastrointestinal symptoms. Some patients progress to an ARDS hyperinflammatory phase that is often marked by dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. The respiratory viral load rises before the onset of symptoms and peaks around the onset of symptoms. It declines over the first week. Severe cases have higher viral loads compared with mild cases. Prolonged viral shedding in severe and mild cases is reported though they remain unproven and of unknown benefit. The efficacy of HCQ may depend on the timing of administration, as it is being considered for post-exposure prophylaxis and all stages of infection. Additionally, certain safety concerns have been raised about these agents, not only because of their long half-life but also because of their potential adverse effects when combined with certain other drugs. Here we will review the known effects of HCQ on virus replication and the immune system and present the evidence to date and notable considerations for HCQ therapy in patients with COVID-19.",

Keyaerts and colleagues showed that no significant viral replication was measured in Vero E6 cells inoculated with SARS-CoV in the presence of CQ. 15 The authors did note that antiviral activity diminished as CQ was added later to the cells, suggesting that the mechanism of action may be earlier in the viral life cycle. Later, Vincent et al showed that CQ when added post-infection to Vero E6 cells could markedly decrease the number of infected cells. 16 They suggested that the mechanism of action might include the elevation of endosomal pH, disruption of intracellular transport of the virus, as well as altered glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) potentially reducing SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE-2 and therefore preventing viral entry. Though it is unclear how CQ and HCQ may impact SARS-CoV-2 engagement with other surface-exposed proteins reported to interact with SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2. [17] [18] [19] [20] Similar work was performed after the emergence of a related virus called the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While CQ was shown to have anti-MERS activity in immortalized cell lines, later studies showed that MERS-CoV can rapidly infect certain antigen-presenting cells and that CQ did not inhibit the infection of or viral replication in these cells. 21, 22 After the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, scientists explored drugs that might have efficacy against this novel virus. CQ was rapidly identified as having potent activity in vitro against the virus. 23 The mechanism of action was thought to be the same as was proposed for its activity against SARS-CoV. However, there are no published series or randomized clinical trials of patients with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV treated with HCQ or CQ.",

They found no elevated risk for adverse events for short term HCQ treatment (defined as within the first 30-days after starting therapy) compared with equivalent therapy for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with sulfasalazine. However, they did find a 15%-20% increased risk of chest pain or heart failure and a twofold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in the first month of treatment following the addition of azithromycin to HCQ. This finding highlights the concern that the combination of these two medications may place patients at increased health risk. Given the lack of evidence that HCQ is beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19, these two agents should likely not be combined for COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial unless there are strong indications for each, no viable alternatives in individual patients and they are administered with appropriate counseling and close monitoring for adverse events.",

            "text": "Based on the initial in vitro data, there was early clinical interest in using CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19. A group from China reported an interim analysis of outcomes for more than 100 patients with COVID-19 treated with CQ and noted it was superior to the control. There were, unfortunately, no details about these patients in the report, though they reported that patients who received CQ had less severe pneumonia, improved lung imaging, earlier conversion of viral shedding, and a shorter disease course. 34 They also reported that this treatment was safe. This led to the release of an expert consensus in China that recommended high dose CQ phosphate at 500 mg twice per day (BID) for 10 days for patients with mild, moderate or severe COVID-19. 35 Since that time, several small studies have been released looking at HCQ and CQ in more detail. The first was a small randomized control trial of 30 patients with COVID-19 in China who were randomized 1:1 to receive HCQ or not, in addition to other antivirals that included interferon alpha, umifenovir, and lopinavir/ritonavir. 36 They found no difference in radiographic progress, time to becoming afebrile, or percent who had a negative throat swab at day 7. Shortly thereafter a small non-randomized clinical trial was released from France for hospitalized non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients which reported HCQ led to dramatically faster viral clearance from nasopharynx compared with control. 37 They reported that nearly 60% of patients on HCQ had day 6 viral clearance compared with under 15% of controls. In this methodologically flawed study, 26 patients were in the HCQ arm and 16 in the control arm. The analysis excluded six patients from the analysis who tended to be sicker. The study has since been widely criticized, and the society that published the study subsequently released a statement saying it did not meet their standards. 38 This same French group reported that among the six patients who received HCQ and azithromycin, viral clearance from nasopharynx was fastest; they suggested this might indicate synergy between the two agents. 37 They subsequently released another report of a non-randomized series of 80 patients with mild COVID who had been treated with HCQ and azithromycin. 39 Overall, the patients were admitted with an average of 5 days of symptoms, 93% had a day 8 negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the nasopharynx, and 81.3% were discharged at the time of writing the report with an average hospital length of stay of just over 4.5 days. They had no comparison arm in this second report.",

In this context, HCQ disrupts lysosomal antigen processing by antigen-presenting cells and lowers T-cell recruitment and subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. 47 While the ultimate effect of this modulation of the immune system is favorable for treating auto-immune conditions, it is not clear how these effects of HCQ may affect a person with acute COVID-19. It is important to note that as observed with SARS, patients with COVID-19 can exhibit leuko-and lymphopenia, that NK and CD8 T-cells exhibit markers (NKG2A, PD-1) and diminished function consistent with exhaustion. [48] [49] [50] Further, the extent of functional exhaustion and reduced diversity may correlate with the risk of severe disease, while restoration of monocytes and lymphocytes is linked with improved viral clearance and recovery. [51] [52] [53] Key points to consider are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2 and discussed in further detail below. While it is a potent immune modulator, HCQ is not considered immunosuppressive and has not to date been associated with elevated infection risk. 54 In the context of its long-term use for rheumatologic disease, HCQ has also not been associated with an increased the risk of infection. 55 A large study of more than 16 000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) found no increased risk for pneumonia for those on this agent. 54 Similarly, another cohort of more than 23 000 patients with RA found no elevated risk for infection requiring hospitalization for those on HCQ compared with other agents. 55 A third large cohort study of more than 24 000 patients with RA also found the risk of infection requiring hospitalization or outpatient parenteral antibiotics was less for those on HCQ compared with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. 56 Additionally, a small case-control study of patients with SLE matched 65 patients that developed herpes zoster with 130 that did not and found a reduced the risk of Herpes zoster infection in those receiving HCQ. 57 Furthermore, there has been no signal of elevated infection risk or exacerbation of chronic infections for patients on HCQ and there is, therefore, no warning about infection risk on the FDA label on this drug.",

The typical innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is marked by suppressed type I interferon. TLR 7 plays an important role in the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and initiating the host innate immune response. 58 By increasing endosomal pH, HCQ reduces TLR 7 and TLR 9 affinity for viral RNA, thereby diminishing the induction of cytokines which may play a role in viral control including type I interferon, IL-6, and IL-12. It is important to note that MyD88-dependent signaling is not impacted by CQ, though it can be modulated by SARS-CoV and is necessary for the protection in a murine challenge model. 59 Furthermore, HCQ inhibits cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) activity in host cells. 60 Activation of the cGAS/STING pathway by RNA/DNAdependent mechanism promotes increased type I interferon (IFN\u03b2) production. It is known that SARS-CoV induces cGAS/STING and that SARS-CoV-2 is highly responsive to type I interferon. 61, 62 Additionally, HCQ reduces NK cell cytotoxic function by limiting perforin processing to its functional form. 63 Relevant to reducing cytokine levels, a study of patients receiving CQ for Early Persistent Musculoskeletal Pain and Arthritis who were also infected with Chikungunya Virus demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-13 levels remained strongly up-regulated throughout the study period. 64 The ultimate effects of HCQ on the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown but are clearly important to consider in this clinical context.",

ADE occurs when non-neutralizing antibodies bind the virus, thereby promoting entry through the FC-receptor, and is of particular concern when patients exhibit low levels of neutralizing antibodies. 76 Furthermore, though long-term administration does not appear to negatively impact vaccination to prevent bacterial and viral infections, antibody-mediated responses are diminished by concurrent vaccination and short-course treatment with HCQ.

Activated pDCs induce the activation of the adaptive immune response observations highlight that the immunomodulatory effect of HCQ on COVID-19 remains unknown. HCQ may contribute to dampening an overly exuberant immune response during the inflammatory phase of the infection and enhance cross-presentation to CD8 T-cells and their IFN\u03b3 production. It is also possible that acute treatment with HCQ may weaken the innate immune response to the virus, impair adaptive immune responses, and could, in the worst case, alter the repertoire of T-cells and B-cells generated in response to SARS-CoV-2, potentially reducing the efficacy of recall responses to re-exposure or even put them at risk for antibody-mediated enhancement. The activity of HCQ in the context of virus-induced inflammation, innate immune activity, and nascent adaptive responses creates a complex milieu that will require careful study to decipher and discern which patients, dosing, and stage of the disease may benefit from this intervention.",

The initial anecdotal reports out of China led to the initial wide uptake of HCQ and to a lesser extent CQ for many hospitalized patients with COVID-19 around the globe. As more data have become available, enthusiasm for these medications has been tempered. Well designed, large randomized controlled trials are needed to help determine what role, if any, these medications should have in treating COVID-19 moving forwards. While HCQ has in vitro activity against a number of viruses, it does not act like more typical nucleoside/tide antiviral drugs. For instance, HCQ is not thought to act on the critical viral enzymes including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, or proteases. Despite in vitro activity against influenza, in a large high quality randomized controlled trial, it showed no clinical benefit, suggesting that similar discordance between in vitro and in vivo observations is possible for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 73 (Table 3) .",

While large scale studies have demonstrated that long-term treatment with CQ or HCQ does not increase the incidence of infection, caution should be exercised in extrapolating safety from the studies of chronic administration to largely healthy individuals to estimate the risk associated with short-course treatment in acutely and severely ill patients. Furthermore, the immunologic actions that make HCQ an important drug for the treatment of auto-immune diseases might have unintended consequences when it is used for patients with COVID-19. The effects of this immune modulation on patients with COVID-19 are unknown at this time, including a potential negative impact on antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses which need to be considered and studied.",
