While the predominant complication of COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular complications and sepsis have a heightened risk of developing shock with potential in-hospital mortality during the disease course. Acute cardiac injury has been reported to be ranging from 12% to 16.7% in COVID-19 patients.",

Random effects models were obtained to perform a meta-analysis, and I 2 statistics were used to measure inter-study heterogeneity. After a thorough review of the literature from PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar, data were collected from 5 studies (4/5 septic shock) reported from China until March 2020. Among 1578 COVID-19 patients, the pooled prevalence of shock was 6.3%(95CI 4.0%-2 16.8%), I 2 =96%, with the cohort greater than 50-years of mean age showing significantly higher prevalence of shock [9.5%(2.4%-20.5%)] compared to younger cohort (mean age<50 years) [3.3% (95CI 0-11.4%)].",

During a viral illness, the up-regulation of cytokines like IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 potentiates the vasodilation leading to shock. Similarly, IL-1\u03b2/6/8, MCP-1 and PAI-1 levels are increased in acute phase of sepsis, reflecting endothelial injury. Viral infections could trigger a hyper-inflammatory state, like cytokine-storm syndrome, as featured in COVID-19 patients, which could contribute to developing shock with a potential of multiorgan dysfunction.",

More data are required on the prevalence of shock, its predictors and their impact on the survival of elderly COVID-19 patients to effectively maneuver supportive resuscitation measures on time. Furthermore, elderly survivors requiring prolonged nursing care and ventilator support might also add up to the magnitude of complications and economic liability during this global healthcare crisis.",
