Currently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR technology is mainly used to detect 2019-nCoV. According to \"The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)\" issued by National Health and Commission of China and \"The Experts' Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV\" released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, the human samples must be placed under 56 o C or higher to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated as the template of qRT-PCR. In this study, we demonstrated that the virus inactivation treatment disrupts its genome integrity seriously when using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (vaccine), a kind of coronavirus, as a model. Our results showed that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation of 56 o C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% left after the inactivation of 92 o C for 5 minutes when the samples were preserved by Hank's solution, one of an isotonic salt solutions currently suggested. However, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 o C or higher if the samples were preserved with an optimized solution to protect the RNA from being disrupted. We therefore highly recommend to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV genome and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.",

Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the false negative rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in clinical practice is very high, and the positive rate is only 30-50% [2] . False negative detection means missed detection, which will lead to not only the delayed diagnosis of suspected patients, but also the 2019-nCoV carriers becoming the potential sources of virus infection. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the detection rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid clinically.",

Preserved with the optimized solution such as R503, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be kept unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 o C or higher for killing the viruses although the integrity of cellular nucleic acids were obviously disrupted. The results suggest that if the samples were prepared with an optimal solution, the detectable numbers of viral templates would be unchanged because virus inactivation progress with high temperature does not erase all the RNA but leave small fragments of nucleic acids that are good enough for using as the template for qRT-PCR detection.If it is true for 2019-nCoV, preparing the human samples with the optimal solution can not only keep the clinical inspectors from virus infection by inactivating the virus using 56 o C or higher as normal, but also improve the detection sensitivity of viral nucleic acid in the sample, leading to avoiding or at least reducing false negative 10 / 16 results of detection.Recently, Chen reported that the inactivation by incubating the sample with 56 o C for 30 min to kill the virus had no significant effect on the detection of 2019-nCoV by qRT-PCR[5]. However, combining the limitations such as only two samples tested and higher amount of virus in the two samples as the authors discussed in their researches, and our experimental evidences that the virus inactivation by high temperature did reduce the detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus template seriously, it is highly recommended to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.",
