As a result, there may be large differences in total epidemic size from similar initial conditions. This work seeks to determine the extent to which the effects of behavior changes and metapopulation coupling on epidemic size can be characterized. While mathematical models have been developed to study local containment by social distancing, intervention and other behavior changes, their connection to larger-scale transmission is relatively underdeveloped. We make use of the assumption that behavior changes limit local transmission before susceptible depletion to develop a time-varying birth-death process capturing the dynamic decrease of the transmission rate associated with behavior changes. We derive an expression for the mean outbreak size of this model and show that the distribution of outbreak sizes is approximately geometric. This allows a probabilistic extension whereby infected individuals may initiate new outbreaks. From this model we characterize the overall epidemic size as a function of the behavior change rate and the probability that an infected individual starts a new outbreak. We find good agreement between the analytical results and stochastic simulations leading to novel findings including critical learning rates that demarcate large and small epidemic sizes.",

How fast will it spread to other populations? What must be done to achieve containment? How large will the final epidemic be? These questions and others are amenable to theoretical analysis using dynamic models [12] . Most models of disease transmission, however, assume time constant parameters and do not account for changing human behavior or other interventions. The 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola epidemic illustrates this point. With an R 0 around 1.7-3.0 [4, 6, 17] and a population of around 20 million persons [16] in the three primarily affected countries, the final size of an outbreak contained by susceptible depletion [13] would be from 11.7 to 18.8 million persons. In contrast, the actual epidemic size of \u224830,000 persons is much less than 1 % of this size.",

            "text": "Because standard models admit containment only after the outbreak becomes self-limiting through depletion of susceptible persons, they are inappropriate for making predictions about apparent infections, where self-protective behaviors may be quickly adopted, and in modern societies, where global financial, medical, and logistic resources are rapidly mobilized to contain emerging pathogens like SARS, MERS, and Ebola. But, if behaviors change and resources are quickly mobilized, then why have outbreaks of these emerging pathogens persisted as long as they have? One possible explanation is that behavior change and intervention are local events that occur only around transmission clusters and are not completely efficient, so that while behavior change and intervention act to reduce transmission where it is high, a small fraction of infections escape isolation to seed new outbreaks in spatially or socially adjacent populations. According to this idea, the persistence of the pathogen in the population-and the propensity to transition from outbreak to epidemic proportions-is based on a balance between the ability of the pathogen to spark new outbreaks and the capacity of behavior change and intervention to contain these outbreaks before further spread occurs.",

            "text": "Our motivation for this idea comes from the 2014-2015 West Africa Ebola epidemic. For instance, spread among counties in Liberia seems to be consistent with this picture (Fig. 1 ). Here we see that the epidemic was maintained by a series of outbreaks, each of which recapitulates a common pattern of explosive transmission, followed by a decline in the rate of transmission and eventual containment. Because the transmission process in each county occurs almost independently of the other counties (coupling is primarily important for the initial spark and possibly subsequent reinfections), a single compartmental model cannot accurately represent the associated dynamics. Instead, what is required is a model of coupled epidemics. In the following sections we develop a simple, conceptual model of this process. We imagine an epidemic starting with an outbreak originating at a single location. In contrast to most models, we assume that this outbreak is quickly contained by reductions in transmission. The stochastic nature of transmission when only a small number of persons are infected gives rise to a probability distribution in the outbreak size. Although the outbreak is quickly contained, there is a small chance that the infection is spread to an adjacent population before complete containment is achieved. If this occurs, then the process is repeated until finally no further outbreaks occur. It is this outbreak-of-outbreaks that we call an epidemic. To model this two-scale process, we first propose a simple model for the stochastic dynamics of an outbreak subject to behavior change, for which we obtain the mean outbreak size, denoted M. M is Organization declared the Ebola epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern one week later. Here, the cumulative number of cases in each administrative unit is plotted against epidemiological week. These nearly parallel epidemic curves suggest that the same process of outbreak and control was replicated in one county after the next with local interventions and behavior change realized some finite time after cases began accumulating. For instance, approximately the same take-off rate was exhibited by Montserrado as by Grand Cape Mount, despite the fact that their first cases were separated by twelve weeks. Data from the World Health Organization situation reports important for three reasons. First, it enables calculation of the chance that a secondary outbreak is caused, which may be iterated until no further outbreaks result. Guided by numerical experiments, we propose to approximate the probability distribution of the number of outbreaks by a geometric distribution. The second role played by the mean outbreak size is to parameterize the geometric distribution of outbreak number. Finally, by summing a random number of outbreaks with the mean size M, we obtain an approximation for the epidemic size, i.e., the size of all outbreaks added together. The accuracy of this approximation is studied through comparison with simulations. Models that explicitly take account of within and between household transmission have yielded important understanding of the role of host social structure on epidemic development. Part of their success lies in the relatively simple task of enumerating all possible infection statuses of individuals in small households and of assuming a constant hazard of transmission to uninfected cohabitors [2] . In contrast, when attempting to describe connections between local outbreaks (involving population sizes much bigger than households) and larger-scale epidemics against the backdrop of reduced transmission over time, tracking the local outbreak sizes can be challenging. Previous modeling studies of behavior change to limit transmission have generally assumed that transmission dynamics may additionally be slowed by susceptible depletion, e.g., [3, 5, 15] . By instead assuming that behavior changes act before susceptible depletion, birth-death branching process techniques can be utilized. As well as lending analytical tractability, these models likely capture the rapid social distancing and learned risk-averse behavior associated with deadly diseases such as Ebola. In the recent West African outbreak, outbreak sizes were considerably smaller than population sizes (Fig. 1 ).",

Containment is counteracted with the potential of each local outbreak to spark secondary outbreaks through the movement of infected persons so that the final epidemic size reflects the tension between these two processes.",

Moreover, the outbreak size distribution changes in a strongly nonlinear fashion with respect to both the initial rate of transmission and the learning rate. Approximating this distribution by a geometric distribution with mean given by Eq. 15 enables one to investigate the tension between containment and expansive spread, i.e., epidemics. Figure 5 shows there to be a large region of the upper left of the \u03b5 \u2212 \u03c6 parameter space in which epidemics (i.e., extensive outbreaks with multiple communities affected) are exceedingly unlikely. To the right hand of each panel in Fig. 5 , i.e., as \u03b5 \u2192 1, the outbreak size contours turn up rapidly, beyond which movement of infected individuals is so common that the epidemic is effectively well mixed. Outside this range, the outbreak size contours are practically horizontal, illustrating very little dependence on the rate of individual movement so that learning-and the propensity to self-containment-becomes the much more important process. We are unaware of prior results suggesting this transition between epidemics dominated by movement and epidemics dominated by learning.",

Thus, for instance, as one moves from the top of each panel in Fig. 5 the contours become closer together. Similarly, the fat-tail in the outbreak size distribution (Fig. 3) propagates to the epidemic size distribution. This is perhaps most easily seen by noting that there is an approximately one logarithm displacement between the contours for the average epidemic size and the 99th percentile in Fig. 5 . Thus, for an average epidemic size of 1,000, it is not improbable for an epidemic of 10,000 to be realized. Comparison of the approximate analytic results in the first row of Fig. 5 with the exact results from stochastic simulation in the second row shows that although the approximation comes at a small cost in terms of bias, these qualitative conclusions are robust to the range of assumptions required for their solution, particularly the assumption that the zero-inflated distribution of outbreak sizes can be reasonably approximated by a geometric distribution.",

The first of these assumptions biases downward our expression for the total number of outbreaks (Eq. 17). This bias becomes more severe as \u03b5 \u2192 1, i.e., to the right in each panel of Fig. 5 , which would further differentiate our two modes for epidemic expansion. The second issue is of negligible consequence unless the total epidemic size tends to be large relative to the population size (precisely what containment prevents) or where the contacts among susceptible persons are highly structured. While there has been a great deal of theory about this latter condition [9] , whether it obtains in generalized epidemics like Ebola remains poorly understood. Additionally, the modeling approach adopted here may admit other assumptions (particularly concerning the underlying distribution of local outbreak sizes) and extensions, including the seeding of multipe new outbreaks from a single outbreak and a time-varying \"death\" rate in the birth-death process, representing more rapid treatment/isolation with increasing experience.",

The simplifying, plausible assumptions made here have allowed us to relate ultimate epidemic size to the rate at which transmission at a local scale is reduced by behavior change and the probability that a new outbreak is seeded elsewhere before local containment. These analytical results are achieved even though the model does not describe a stationary process and illustrates the value of combining modeling approaches, here the outcome of a potentially large number of branching processes accumulated via convolution. One of the key results is that epidemic size grows faster than exponential with decreasing behavioral learning rate, suggesting that there are critical rates above which behaviors acting to reduce transmission will dramatically reduce the overall number of persons infected during a series of outbreaks. Qualitatively, this phenomenon points to a potential connection between the approach undertaken here and random network modeling [1] where the addition of a few links can lead to explosive percolation suddenly connecting a large proportion of nodes. Practically, it underscores the importance of early response to epidemic containment.",
