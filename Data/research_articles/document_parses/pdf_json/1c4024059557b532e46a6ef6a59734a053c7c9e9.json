CMV has a seroprevalence of 45-100 % with higher rates in Africa, lower rates in Northern Europe and USA, and increasing prevalence with age. Transmission can be via saliva, urine, sexual contact, breast-feeding, placental transmission, blood transfusion or transplantation. In the immunocompetent host primary infection is usually asymptomatic, although it can present as a mononucleosis-like illness, following which the virus undergoes a prolonged period of latency but can become reactivated by a variety of mechanisms including 'stress', sepsis and immunosuppression. For example, TNF-alpha released by rejection or infection can activate the major immediate early promoter (MieP) of CMV and induce intracellular replication. Transplant recipients (and occasionally, it is worth remembering, patients immunosuppressed for autoimmune conditions) can have a primary infection (D+/R\u2212), reinfection (with a different strain) (D+/R+) or reactivation (D\u2212/R+).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HHV-5 Cytomegalovirus (CMV)"}, {"text": "The risk of viraemia is very strongly associated with D+/ R\u2212 status, but in addition the use of depleting antibody induction, acute rejection, poor graft function and older donor age are known risk factors.

Clinical characteristics: many patients who have viraemia are asymptomatic, but there is a strong correlation between viral load and symptoms. The clinical characteristics of CMV infection in the immunocompromised are shown in Table 71 .4 .

This means that a CMV na\u00efve patient can go from asymptomatic with a low detectable viral load to signifi cant end-organ disease within a week. A patient with primary infection often presents with the so-called CMV syndrome (high fever without localising physical signs) that can progress rapidly to gastritis, colitis (often bloody), pneumonitis and other end-organ involvement. This is usually associated with very high viral loads. Patients with reactivation or reinfection may have a less fulminant course with isolated colitis or pneumonitis without an obvious full-blown viral syndrome. Either way, end-organ damage can progress rapidly and can occur with only low-level viraemia or very rarely in the absence of viraemia; therefore, a high index of suspicion is required.

Pneumonitis may present with shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation post-exercise and may progress swiftly from mild dyspnoea to marked desaturation particularly after mild exertion. Chest X-ray (see Fig. 71 .1 ) or CT scan may show signs of an interstitial lung disease, but there is a wide differential so it is essential to get samples, rapidly, (ideally a bronchoalveolar lavage) where possible or treat blindly (covering CMV) or both. It is important to note that CMV infection predisposes to other infections, and viral pneumonitis can coexist with Pneumocystis pneumonitis. Meningitis and encephalitis may present with classic symptoms and signs, or epilepsy and impaired cognition. It can be diagnosed from PCR on CSF, so ensuring the appropriate sample is taken at the time of lumbar puncture is important. Where possible, with tissue-invasive disease such as gastritis, colitis ( Fig. 71 .2 ) and nephritis ( Fig. 71. 3 ), biopsy, culture and PCR are critical.

This is not without controversy. For instance, studies showing an association with acute cellular rejection have not always differentiated cause of effect, and a signifi cant proportion (80 % in our experience) of acute rejection precedes CMV viraemia, so much of this association may simply be a response to increased immunosuppression. CMV viraemia is immunomodulatory and predisposes to EBV and HHV-6 viraemia, as well as an increase in fungal infections, although again CMV viraemia may also be a biomarker of over immunosuppression. Some studies have shown increased mortality, and worse 4-year graft survival has also been shown [ 8 ] ; however, a UK study based on serology in 10,000 transplants showed no effect on patient or allograft survival [ 9 ] . A detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter, but what is clear is that overt CMV disease is nasty and best avoided. There are a variety of recommendations on the prevention and treatment of CMV post-transplant [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] , and the 2011 BTS guidelines nicely summarise the current evidence [ 12 ] . For kidney transplantation most guidelines favour universal prophylaxis (for D+/R\u2212 or any positive recipients), especially following depleting antibodies. This is, in part based on meta-analyses of prophylaxis studies demonstrating a benefi t in all cause mortality with prophylaxis [ 13 ] . Most of the studies in the meta-analyses have short follow-up and very few patients in the pre-emptive arm. Guidelines mostly acknowledge that pre-emptive therapy is probably equally appropriate if the logistics can be robustly managed (the case for pre-emptive over prophylaxis is eloquently argued by Thomas Reischig [ 14 ] ) and there is some suggestion that the prevailing opinion is moving towards equal recommendation for pre-emptive and prophylaxis .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 417, "text": "[ 6 , 7 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1060, "text": "[ 8 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1178, "text": "[ 9 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1418, "text": "[ 4 , 10 , 11 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1493, "text": "[ 12 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1785, "text": "[ 13 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2113, "text": "[ 14 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HHV-5 Cytomegalovirus (CMV)"}, {"text": "The main advantages of universal prophylaxis include ease of administration and co-prophylaxis against viruses (such as primary HSV), with disadvantages including drug side effects (especially leucopenia) and the concern of lateonset disease. The advantages of pre-emptive approach include limiting drug exposure to those that need it, encouraging immunity, and the near complete absence of late disease. The disadvantages of pre-emptive therapy include the extra vigilance required and the lack of co-prophylaxis. To summarise the current guidelines [ 4 , 10 -12 ] on prevention, most recommend prophylaxis with valgancyclovir (superior to acyclovir, valacyclovir or oral gancyclovir) starting within 10 days of transplant for D+/R\u2212 and R+ patients. Based on the fi ndings of the IMPACT study [ 15 ] which showed a reduced rate of late-onset CMV disease with 200 compared to 100 days treatment (16 % vs. 37 %), the guidelines tend to favour treatment for 200 days in D+/R\u2212 and in those who have received depleting antibodies such as ATG. The dose recommended for those with normal renal function is 900 mg per day, but 450 mg appears to be as effective, causes much less leucopenia but potentially increases the risk of resistance [ 16 ] . Further dose reduction for renal impairment is required. The risk of CMV disease in D\u2212/ R\u2212 is so low as to not require CMV prophylaxis but does therefore mandate anti-HSV prophylaxis. Clinicians need to be vigilant to CMV post-prophylaxis and have a system of monitoring patients at this time as well as being alert to the possibility of viral resistance or non-compliance during prophylaxis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 794, "end": 800, "text": "[ 15 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1238, "text": "[ 16 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "HHV-5 Cytomegalovirus (CMV)"}, {"text": "Our experience of the pre-emptive approach has been very positive with CMV syndrome developing in only 4.9 %, end-organ disease in approximately 1 % and only 2.3 % of late-onset viraemia (fi rst episode after 90 days) [ 5 ] .
