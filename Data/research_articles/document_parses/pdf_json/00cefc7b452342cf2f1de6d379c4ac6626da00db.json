Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 shares a receptor with SARS-CoV, providing clues regarding its cell entry, viral infection route, and pathogenic mechanisms at the cellular level. Except for asymptomatic carriers, infection with this virus causes a large fraction of patients to develop moderate clinical illness in a short period, with a small but a substantial number of patients experiencing severe disease characterized by fatal acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Stem cells in the respiratory tract /lung parenchyma appear to play a major role by interacting with the virus to cause entry infection, lung damage, and repair. Exogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising cell therapy for modulating the immune dysregulation underlying ALI/ARDS to restore lung function . Transplantation of exogenous stem cells may lead to lung repair and regeneration. To be prepared for the worst-case scenario of coronavirus reemergence, it is important to develop vaccines and therapeutics. Stem cell-derived natural killer cells(NK cells) and off-the-shelf virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may be useful for meeting this urgent medical need. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of coronavirus infection and pathogenesis, with a special emphasis on the involvement of stem cells (Figure 1 ).",

Phylogenic analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 forms a distinct clade from SARS-CoV but shares 79.5% homology with SARS-CoV. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) have officially announced the disease as COVID-19 and designated the virus itself as SARS-CoV-2. Some initially infected patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Wet Market, potentially involving animal contact. The virus is thus thought to have a zoonotic origin, after which human-to-human transmission occurred. Its genetic sequences have shown high similarities to bat coronaviruses (96%), indicating the likelihood of bats being the ultimate origin (Zhou et al., 2020) . Although an intermediate reservoir such as a pangolin was proposed (Tao Zhang, 2020) , the exact source of the virus and how it crosses the species barrier and jumps to humans remains largely unknown (Yu et al., 2020) .",

The overall sequence similarities between the SARS-CoV-2 spike and SARS-CoV spike (isolated from human, civet, or bat) are approximately 76-78% for the whole protein, 73-76% for the receptor-binding domain, and 50-53% for the receptor-binding motif (Wan et al.,2020) . SARS-CoV spike protein engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor. Importantly, among the 14 key ACE2-contacting residues in the receptor-binding domain previously identified in SARS-CoV, 9 are fully conserved and 4 are partially conserved among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV from human, civet, and bat (Wan et al., 2020) . Based on a previous study of SARS-CoV and sequence similarity, structural modeling strongly predicted that SARS-CoV-2 employs the ACE2 receptor for cell entry as well. In agreement with these findings, directed expression of human ACE2 allowed S protein pseudotyped-particle entry into the otherwise non-susceptible BHK cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020) , indicating that SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-S uses ACE2 for cellular entry. In addition, a publication in Nature described that when directly combined SARS-CoV-2 with HeLa cells, SARS-CoV-2 could use ACE2 receptors from human, bat, civet, and swine, but not mouse, as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing HeLa cells, except in cells without ACE2 expression (Zhou et al., 2020) . Together, the structural modeling, pseudotyping, and infection data provide strong evidence that human ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.",

In one report, approximately one-third of SARS-infected patients had selflimited symptoms with no clinical or radiological evidence of progression to pneumonitis (Tsui et al.,2003) , but upper respiratory tract symptoms occurred in a minority of patients with SARS (Peiris et al., 2003) .

Using a non-human primate model, Liu et al found that ACE2-positive cells were widely distributed in the upper respiratory tract in Chinese macaques, and ACE2 epithelial cells lining the salivary gland ducts were early target cells that were productively infected (Liu et al., 2011) . Further studies are warranted to examine whether those cells are stem cells or well-differentiated cells. Another in vitro study showed that SARS-CoV efficiently infected ciliated cells when applied to the apical surface. The virus then replicated in polarized epithelia and preferentially exited via the apical surface (Jia et al., 2005) . It also would be of interest to test if the mucociliary clearance function was impaired in order to facilitate the releasing of virus into the lumen of the human lung. Collectively, both clinical and experimental data suggest a critical role for viral production in upper respiratory sites, including salivary gland ducts, in the early phase of infection. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 has a lot of resemblance to SARS-CoV, for instance, respiratory droplet transmission (Lai et al., 2020) . While revising the manuscript, newly emerging data demonstrated that ciliated cells in nasal epithelia have the highest gene expression of ACE2 across airway (Sungnak et al., 2020) . And in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, nasal swabs have yielded higher CoV-SARS-2 viral loads than throat swabs(K. K. Zhou et al., 2020) . These data strongly suggest nasal epithelium as a more important portal within upper airway for initial virus infection, production and transmission. (Kim et al., 2005) , which can be used to test infection in the lower airway. Although transgenic mice and non-human primate models are the next step for conducting these studies, they are might be taking long time and costly.",

The counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells were substantially reduced, whereas their status was hyperactivated (Huang et al., 2020) .

Therefore adoptive immune therapy is a promising alternative. On January 29, 2020, Sorrento Therapeutics and Celularity Inc initiated Leen et al., 2013; Vickers et al., 2014) . However, broader implementation of this therapeutic approach is limited by time, cost, complexity, and lack of seropositive donors for individualized product manufacture, which may preclude the immediate availability of CTLs for urgent medical needs. Coronavirus poses a serious threat of reemergence, and thus an immediately available off-the-shelf product is needed. Such feasibility was only recently demonstrated (Minagawa et al., 2018; Nishimura et al., 2013; Tzannou et al., 2017) . The innovative idea is that antigen-specific CTL clones are first established from antigen-specific CTLs obtained from the peripheral blood. These clones are reprogrammed into iPSCs (T-iPSCs), which can re-differentiate into CTLs that retain their ancestral antigen specificity and cytotoxicity, but with 100 \u223c 1000-fold greater expansion capability. Thus, these cells can be banked as unlimited off-the-shelf therapeutics to meet urgent needs (Minagawa et al., 2018; Nishimura et al., 2013; Tzannou et al., 2017 ",

However, in vivo confirmation of the identity of virus-targeted cells in the early phase is difficult because of the lack of availability of samples from patients who died within 3 days after illness onset or even before onset. Most data from human respiratory tissue of patients with SARS were obtained at two or more weeks following disease onset(Franks et al., 2003;K. F. To et al., 2004). Although SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV showed numerous similarities, direct evidence regarding how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the respiratory tract is lacking. Airway stem cells may offer a quick in vitro solution for these studies. We and others have shown that basal cells from the nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa exhibit cardinal features of stem cells(Hong et al., 2004;F. Yu et al., 2017; F. Yu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012). When cultured at the air-liquid interface on Transwell(F. Yu et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2012), they can different into pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium that recapitulates the morphological and physiological features of the human conducting airway in vivo. SARS-CoV-2 then can be applied to the pseudostratified epithelium at the apical or basolateral side to examine the potential for infection. While some animal models are under development, most of the virus research is carried out in immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line. Although Vero E6 cell model is convenient and useful, it has limitations and does not allow for the understanding of virus biology and evolution. This ex vivo Transwell model will constitute a convenient tool to study the viral infection and test antiviral drugs. In the same way, Oct4 + BASCs at the bronchioalveolar duct junction can readily form expandable colonies in vivo",

            "text": "Stem cells for therapy. Severe pneumonia caused by pathogenic coronaviruses is often associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses (cytokine storm) resulting inALI and ARDS(Channappanavar & Perlman, 2017). The pathological features of COVID-19 strongly resemble those of ARDS associated with SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections(Xu et al., 2020), such as massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure.The current treatments for ARDS associated with coronavirus infection include early combination use of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesvir lopinavir plus ritonavir) plus steroids (hydrocortisone, interferon)(Tsui et al., 2003), and supportive measures, such as lungprotective ventilation and conservative fluid management(Acute Respiratory DistressSyndrome et al., 2000;National Heart et al., 2006). No pharmacological therapies appear to effectively halt the disease, as it progresses very rapidly. Studies of humans who died from SARS and COVID-19 suggested that a dysregulated immune response occurred, resulting in excessive inflammation and lethal ARDS(Channappanavar &   Perlman, 2017; Nicholls et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2020;Zumla, Hui, Azhar, Memish, & Maeurer, 2020). Thus, immunomodulation should be an effective therapy, such as by using stem cells. MSCs represent one of the most promising candidates since their safety and efficacy have been shown in pre-clinical models of ARDS(Hayes et al., 2012;Horie, Gonzalez et al., 2018). During revision of this manuscript, a study using MSCs to treat patients with COVID-19 was published. Seven critically ill patients were intravenously administered MSCs at 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per kilogram body weight, followed by 14-day observation. The treatment was safe and had no adverse effects. Inflammatory and immune functions were corrected based on measurement of cytokine levels (i.e., TNF\u03b1, IL-10) and a subset of immune cells (D4, CD8, NK, DC cells). Importantly, the pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved at 2 days after MSC transplantation(Leng et al., 2020). Additionally, the MSCs were ACE2-and TMPRSS2-negative at the gene level, suggesting the unlikelihood of virus infection in the transplanted cells. Together with local hospitals in Wuhan, we treated 24 critically ill patients with COVID-19 via intravenous administration of clinical-grade human MSCs derived from umbilical cord. The treatment was safe and resulted in improved functional outcomes in patients( manuscript under preparation). In short, MSCs appear show the greatest immediate potential for clinical translation for treating COVID-19, given that they may favorably modulate the immune response to reduce lung injury while maintaining host immune-competence.Stem cells for repair and regeneration. SARS targets endogenous lung stem cells, whichlikely also occurs for SARS-CoV-2. This could explain the apparent loss in the capacity for lung repair after coronavirus infection and later phases of lung failure in severely diseased patients(Peiris et al., 2003). Long-term survivors exhibit aberrant or excess remodeling involving tissue fibrosis. Regeneration of the injured distal lung epithelium and restoration of alveolar barrier function are prerequisite for re-establishing proper gas exchange. Transplantation of exogenously derived stem cells may be an option for this situation. The molecular mechanisms underlying stem/progenitor cell-mediated regenerative responses have not been well-characterized. Particularly, the impact of coronavirus infection on endogenous lung stem cells and their regenerative responses remain unclear. This type of data is not yet available for patients with SARS or COVID-19",

Although there are safety concerns that must be addressed, such as undesirable rearrangement of the TCRA gene during reprogramming and redifferentiation, anti-virus activity was demonstrated in models of killing human immunodeficiency virus and Epstein-Barr virus in vitro and in vivo(Ando & Nakauchi,   2017; Doubrovina et al., 2012;Nishimura et al., 2013;Vickers et al., 2014). However, SARS-COV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte infusion as a possible treatment option for COVID-19 patients with severe disease , has not received enough attention till today.Concluding Remarks. Pulmonary stem cells are among a variety of cell types along respiratory tract to lung parenchyma targeted by coronavirus infection. The consequences of infection include ARDS/ALI, and eventually, loss of the ability to endogenously repair the lungs. Mesenchymal stem cells constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for patients suffering from coronaviruses infection associated ALI/ARDS by immune modulation. Transplantation of exogenous stem cells may directly replace injured lung tissues. Ultimately, while vaccines are under development, NK cells and virus-specific CTLs engineered using iPSC technology may offer an off-the-shelf cell therapeutic option for preventing the reemergence of coronaviruses . 583-589. doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2020.03.007 Ando, M., & Nakauchi, H.
