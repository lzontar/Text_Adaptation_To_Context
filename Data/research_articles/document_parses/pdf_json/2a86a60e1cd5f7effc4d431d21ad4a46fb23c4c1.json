In the past, experimental evolution of viruses in different host environments has proven to be a useful tool in quantifying fitness increases and the dynamics of adaptation. By classic sequencing techniques, some of the key genetic determinants responsible have been identified [3, 4] , but until the advent of deep sequencing, analysis of the mutational composition of RNA virus populations was hampered by lack of depth of sequence coverage. The potential to describe the whole virus mutant spectrum and detect variants that otherwise would be overlooked by conventional sequencing is fundamental to studying virus evolution and understanding emergence [5] .

We used Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) as a model, since the genetics of this virus and the interactions between the cell receptors and viral capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) are well characterized. CVB3 enters the cell through a primary receptor, the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) [12] , while certain strains may use as co-receptor the Decay Accelerating Factor (DAF) [13, 14] , also known as CD55. To study expansion of host tropism, we passaged virus in two cellular environments, a highly permissive one and a less permissive one. By deep sequencing longitudinal samples of experimentally evolved populations, we identify the emergence of host environment-specific mutations undergoing positive selection. We show that Coxsackie virus adapts differently to two cell types according to receptor and co-receptor availability in a multi-step adaptation sequence that involves group selection of minority variants.

Differences between passage numbers are all significant, p<0.0001; no significant differences between cell type at each passage number, student's paired t test, n = 12. secondary beneficial mutations with less effect are unable to compete, thereby rendering the adaptation process sequential [17] [18] [19] . Given the different frequencies of minority variants observed at passage 40, we examined the patterns of emergence and sequential adaptation to novel environments by deep sequencing every second passage in the A549 cell series (Fig 3 and S1 Dataset). A number of step-wise trends were observed across the replicates. In all six replicates, the VP3-E76G mutation was the first mutation to emerge (already above 0.1% at passage 1) and peak by passage 11 to become the most abundant mutation in the population (between 65 and 95%). Furthermore, the increase in frequency of E76G over the first 11 passages (Fig 3) correlated with the increases in fitness over the same period (Fig 4A) , underscoring a considerable contribution of this single mutation to population fitness. Indeed, the E76G variant was generated by reverse genetics and found to confer significantly enhanced fitness in A549 cells ( Fig 4B) . Although the VP3-76 residue was not previously identified as a contact between virus and receptor, this residue maps to the icosahedral three fold region of the capsid ( Fig 4C) . In the three dimensional virus-receptor structure, there is an interaction between the C-terminal 6-His tags of three symmetry related DAF molecules [20] . This interference by the His-tag may have restricted the normal interactions of DAF SCR3/4 with the virus surface, masking a potential role for residue 76. In a biolayer interferometry assay using BLItz technology [21] ( Fig  4D) , E76G bound DAF with the same affinity as wildtype virus, but no increased binding could be detected. Despite the clear fitness advantage conferred by the E76G mutation alone (approximately 10-fold increase with respect to wildtype), it could not account for the more significant fitness increases observed in the passaged populations, particularly at late passage stages (nearly 100-fold increases). Following the fixation of this first mutation, the frequency of VP3-E76G plateaued until a second increase after passage 27, in each of the six replicates, coinciding with the emergence of different combinations of mutations, all mapping to the DAF footprint ( Fig  3) . Closer examination of the patterns of emerging mutations revealed potential synergistic and antagonistic epistasis among variants. Despite the advantage afforded by extreme depth in coverage, the Illumina technology used here set a limit of 69 nucleotides for read length. In principle, this limitation forfeits the possibility of linking more distant mutations and identifying haplotypes. However, the longitudinal deep sequence data revealed that several mutations increase with parallel kinetics and frequency, suggesting that: i) each mutation appeared in individual genomes and the variants were selected as a group and/or ii) the mutations are accumulating in the same genome, resulting in the selection of single haplotypes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 723, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 724, "end": 728, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 729, "end": 733, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1977, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2194, "end": 2198, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 963, "end": 969, "text": "(Fig 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1339, "end": 1346, "text": "(Fig 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1417, "text": "(Fig 4A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1634, "end": 1641, "text": "Fig 4B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1821, "text": "Fig 4C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2209, "text": "Fig  4D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 2873, "end": 2880, "text": "Fig  3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Population deep sequencing of longitudinal samples identifies multi-step adaption to novel host environments"}, {"text": "To distinguish between the above cases, phylogenetic trees describing the mix of haplotypes at each passage were inferred from the longitudinal data using maximum likelihood estimation in a Bayesian model.

Because the particular strain of CVB3 Nancy used to initiate the passage series already contains some DAF-specific binding residues not found on other Nancy clones, we cannot speculate with confidence which way evolution would go in HeLa cells. In retrospect, inclusion of a CAR-exclusive binding strain of Coxsackie virus in the passage series would have helped discern the direction of evolution in HeLa cells. In A549 cells, on the other hand, the principal receptor CAR is mainly located in tight cell-cell contacts and likely inaccessible to the virus during initial stages of infection; while DAF is present throughout the surface, but at relatively low levels compared to HeLa cells. Thus, the focus of selection is entirely on residues involved in DAF binding (VP3-63, VP3-234) or shared in the CAR-DAF footprints (VP2-138) . The CAR-specific mutations observed at residue VP1-259 in HeLa cells, were not observed in A549 cells. The dominant mutation, VP3-E76G, occurred in all six A549-passaged replicates and in none of the HeLa passages-a residue that was not identified as a determinant by conventional structural studies of receptor usage [20] . In the original structural studies, the interaction of residue VP3-76 could not be determined due to steric hindrance of the 6 His-tag between the DAF short consensus repeat domains, SCR3/4, and the virus surface. When CAR is not accessible, DAF is thought to facilitate translocation of the virus to tight junctions containing CAR [22, 23] . The interaction with CAR mediates the transition to the A-particle, a required entry intermediate of expanded structure relative to native virus [24] .

By Sanger sequencing, only the E76G mutation would have been identified in each replicate. The remainder of mutants found to be positively selected during adaptation to host environment were all minority variants that could have otherwise been missed in multiple replicates. An issue inherent to deep sequencing technology is the estimated error of the chemistry (0.1% for Illumina sequencing), which has been regarded as a caveat to properly describe RNA virus quasispecies or mutant spectra. This problem was recently resolved by elegant molecular biology techniques to remove background error [8, 25] . By applying more stringent bioinformatic treatment in our study, between 1700 and 2500 individual, statistically significant point mutations were identified in the structural protein region of the six replicates of A549-adapted populations; yet only mutations in positions related to the DAF footprint underwent selection and amplification over time (S1 Dataset). We thus show that robust bioinformatic treatment coupled with longitudinal data can circumvent error-related issues by identifying changes in variant frequency that would indicate positive or negative selection. This is particularly relevant to in vivo or clinical samples where the quantity of RNA genomes may be too low for more direct sequencing approaches and would require PCR amplification. Similar, relatively simple experimental studies could be designed to understand the population dynamics and evolution of pathogens in new environments during host adaptation and host switching, by identifying the selection over time of one or more mutations as single or multiple genotypes.

Initially, we expected mutations to accumulate in a step-wise manner in a single genotype; however, fitness assays revealed that genotypes harboring double and triple combinations of these mutations presented fitness decreases relative to the wildtype and/or E76G backgrounds. Instead, computational inference of haplotypes suggested that such variants existed as a heterogeneous population of distinct genotypes. An intriguing observation was that no single variant (nor combination of two variants) conferred the high fitness values observed in the passage 40 populations. Strikingly, only the combination of the four most predominant genotypes, as an artificial quasispecies with the same frequencies observed in the passage 40 populations, was able to confer the same fitness values as the p40 replicate samples. This phenomenon is reminiscent of previous work that suggested that minority variants within an RNA virus quasispecies may contribute significantly to phenotype [26] . In that study, a high-fidelity poliovirus with restricted quasispeces composition was unable to infect the central nervous system (CNS); while the same virus stock that was chemically mutagenized to present wildtype numbers of minority variants restored the ability to disseminate to the CNS. Unfortunately, deep sequencing technology was not yet available and the authors could not uncover the identity of these presumed minority variants by Sanger technology to confirm their hypothesis. Here, we succeed in identifying the variants involved. Importantly, we provide evidence for group selection within the virus population and show that only the group contribution of these positively selected minority variants confers the fitness phenotype observed in the original samples. Our results thus illustrate the significant role of minority genomes in the fitness and phenotype of a virus population, providing further evidence for the quasispecies behavior of RNA viruses under certain conditions. It is important to note, however, that the group selection observed in this study resulted from relatively large population size in passages that reached high MOI by the time cell monolayers were lysed for subsequent passage.
