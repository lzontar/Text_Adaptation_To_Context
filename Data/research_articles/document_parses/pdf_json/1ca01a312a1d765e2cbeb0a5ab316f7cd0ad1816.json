However, our intervention FD module did not appropriately increase participants' familiarity with delivering CC-based itinerant and circuit bedside teaching. In general, it is more challenging to train to delivery CC-based bedside teaching, as it is a more complex clinical environment than a teaching clinics. In bedside teaching, faculties must alternate among the roles of doctor, instructor and leader [30] [31] [32] . Accordingly, in future versions of the intervention module, it will be necessary to increase the proportion of training on aspects of delivering skills of CC-based bedside teaching. In our institution, teaching awards winners are selected online by junior medical trainees according to the annual performance of teachers. Consequently, teaching award winners are considered to be more high teaching performance teachers than non-teaching award winners. Besides encouraging high teaching-performance teachers, teaching awards provide opportunities for teachers and program directors to review their teaching and programs. Teaching awards also motivate low teaching-performance teachers to improve themselves by receiving more training. In general, educational leaders in CC education tend to be high teaching-performance teachers as opposed to low teachingperformance teachers. Baroffio et al. have suggested that the ideal leadership FD program will to help the teaching performance and leadership of low teaching-performance teachers [33] . Engagement and serial evaluations have been reported as successful strategies for improving the teaching performance of low teaching-performance faculty [34, 35] .

First, it did not assess outcomes at level 4 of the Kirkpatrick Model such as whether the intervention FD module improved clinical education or decreased medical errors [14, 15, [36] [37] [38] [39] . Therefore, it will be necessary to assess such parameters in the future. On the other hand, selfreporting data is valuable for obtaining subjects' perspectives and views, but it has potentially selection and recall bias [40] . To avoid such bias, in our study, the selfreported questionnaires were completed by voluntary participants immediately before and after the training and that can be avoided from. Usually, voluntary participants have stronger motivation than other participants which can result in a selection bias. Nevertheless, the similar questionnaires, follow-up duration and criteria selection for enrollment of participants between regular and intervention groups in our study can partially overcome the possible bias of self-reported data. A second limitation was the fact that the intervention FD group completed leadership training and some of the questions on the surveys were leadership-related. To have comparable results, both the regular and intervention FD groups used similar questionnaires for self-assessment in our study. Still, the multiple self-assessment time points in the current study indicated sustained effects of the intervention FD module on leadership training of clinical instructors in delivering, designing and leading CC-based teaching and assessment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 226, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 227, "end": 230, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 231, "end": 235, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 236, "end": 240, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 241, "end": 245, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 246, "end": 250, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 473, "end": 477, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strengths and limitations"}, {"text": "Faced with continuous changes in medical education and practice, the new generation of medical educators is required to be not only clinical instructors but also educational leaders.
