Referring to online networking platforms through which individuals can rent out for a short period of time their under-utilised property space (Belk, 2014) , P2P accommodation has emerged as one of the greatest disruptors on the hospitality industry (Sigala, 2017) . Indeed, P2P accommodation has come to represent an attractive, alternative accommodation option due to the numerous economic and social advantages it carries. Specifically, it has been argued that P2P accommodation represents a convenient and value-formoney option for tourists (Tussyadiah, 2016 ) that offers a more authentic tourist experience (Shuqair et al., 2019) which facilitates 'a home away from home' feeling (Liang et al., 2018a) . The phenomenal growth of P2P accommodation is also attributed to the economic and social benefits it brings to hosts as well. For instance, it allows hosts to earn additional income in a flexible manner (Guttentag, 2015) while it provides individuals with entrepreneurial opportunities (Zhang et al., 2019) . Moreover, a desire for social interaction encourages individuals to engage in P2P accommodation Moon et al., 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 241, "text": "(Belk, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 336, "end": 350, "text": "(Sigala, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 631, "end": 648, "text": "(Tussyadiah, 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 699, "end": 721, "text": "(Shuqair et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 772, "end": 793, "text": "(Liang et al., 2018a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1016, "text": "(Guttentag, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1082, "end": 1102, "text": "(Zhang et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1219, "text": "Moon et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although numerous P2P accommodation platforms have emerged over the years, Airbnb is considered as the market leader.

Accordingly, the profile of guests is also changing as Airbnb seems to be attracting a group of customers (e.g. business travellers) who would not have previously consider using P2P platforms (Guttentag and Smith, 2017) .

Broadly defined as \"the potential to act\" (Buchanan and Badham, 1999:52) and \"the potential to influence others' actions\" (Emerson, 1976:354) , power involves the behavioural elements of two or more parties which attempt to use available resources to change or maintain relationships in accordance to their own interests. Although early work on power conceptualised the term as being a centralised factor of domination based on economic interests (e.g. Dahl, 1961; Weber, 1947) , contemporary sociological discourse posits that power may be decentralised, emerging as a social factor that is created by human agents whilst also influencing them (Foucault, 1980; Giddens, 1982) . Indeed, drawing upon Gramsci's view of power, Arendt argued (1970) that domination may occur not only through coercion but also through consent, concluding that power is a collective capacity. Such proposition builds upon previous representations of power as a facilitative force (Parsons, 1967) that may produce and achieve collective goals. A consideration of power as a relational concept acknowledges the mutual dependence between parties. Within this context, the exercise of power need not be at the expense of the exchange partner but to achieve a desirable outcome. Indeed, power relations are not necessarily hierarchical and unilateral as relations may be characterised by a balance of power emerging from a bargaining process (Wrong, 1995) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 51, "end": 77, "text": "(Clegg and Haugaard, 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 176, "end": 189, "text": "(Wrong, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 234, "end": 264, "text": "(Buchanan and Badham, 1999:52)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 314, "end": 333, "text": "(Emerson, 1976:354)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 645, "end": 656, "text": "Dahl, 1961;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 657, "end": 669, "text": "Weber, 1947)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 837, "end": 853, "text": "(Foucault, 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 854, "end": 868, "text": "Giddens, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 917, "end": 937, "text": "Arendt argued (1970)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1166, "text": "(Parsons, 1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1621, "text": "(Wrong, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The concept of power"}, {"text": "Building on Bachrach and Baratz's (1962) over and covert faces of power, Lukes' (1974) conceptualisation of 'power to' and 'power over' is useful in understanding the exercise of power. Relevant to the view of power as a positive, productive phenomenon (Foucault, 1982) , 'power to' refers to the ability to act and represents a collective force stemming from communal activity (Arendt, 1963) . In this regard, Lukes (2005) suggested that power and powerlessness are not necessarily antithetical terms as parties may be able to yield outcomes by furthering their interests or influencing the interests of others either positively or negatively. Contrary, 'power over' relates to coercive forms of power and has three levels: (a) the direct domination of A over B; (b) an indirect form of 'power over' where A manipulates the rules of the game so that B does what A wants; and (c) subtle forms of control and domination exerted through psychological means (Hendriks, 2009 ). Consequently, a soft form of power that depicts the ability of one to get others to do what they want them to through co-option is associated with the third level of power (Nye, 2008) . Accordingly, Lukes (2005) proposed three views on power. A 'one-dimensional' approach labelled power modification, whereby the stakeholder with most power applies force in order to change the behaviour of others in the decision-making process and satisfy his/her own interests. A 'two-dimensional' approach known as power agenda, wherein the agenda is shaped by those in power in such a way that the powerless are left unable to resist. Last, a 'threedimensional' approach called power contradiction, which recognises that people may act willingly even if it contradicts their self-interests as those with power elicit a desired behaviour in the powerless with pervasive ideology or false consciousness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 25, "end": 40, "text": "Baratz's (1962)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 253, "end": 269, "text": "(Foucault, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 378, "end": 392, "text": "(Arendt, 1963)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 411, "end": 423, "text": "Lukes (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 955, "end": 970, "text": "(Hendriks, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1157, "text": "(Nye, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1185, "text": "Lukes (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The exercise of power"}, {"text": "While the concept of 'power over' remains in Lukes' focus, the means by which entities attempt to gain desired outcomes emerges as an important issue. As such, French et al,'s (1959) taxonomy of social power offers insights on how power manifests in specific settings. According to the most recent typology (Raven, 1993) , power may emerge from: expertise and knowledge (expert power), forceful means to extract compliance to desired behaviours (coercive power), legitimacy and positional authority (legitimate power), affiliation to certain groups (referent power), possession of information others require (information power) and the ability to reward or punish certain behaviour by offering or rejecting tangible, social or emotional rewards to others (reward power). One's bases (sources) of power are only effective when the 'power subject' believes in and agrees, either implicitly or explicitly, to the power dynamic exerted by the 'power holder'. The view that power is socially constructed is shared by Foucault (1980) who argued that power is constructed and exerted through knowledge and in turn normalised through discourse. The knowledge produced informs institutional and social practice and reproduces individual and social identities. Specifically, identity is constructed by individuals who draw on discourses and their relations with others to inform social practice. Evidently, power manifestations are influenced by perceptions over roles and identities. In this regard, individuals may resist the powerful actions of others although, at times, powerlessness to resist exists due to socio-political, emotional and personal factors (Gaventa, 2006) .

In this regard, the terms 'service provider' and 'customer' were proposed as more appropriate to describe the roles of each party (Aramberri, 2001) . Drawing mostly from the social exchange paradigm (Ap, 1992) , research on host-guest relations outlines that the form of exchange between hosts and guests represents a function of the power relationship between the parties (Moyle et al., 2011) , which immerse in the exchange in order to satisfy their respective needs. Although the needs of a party may remain unsatisfied, the relationship could continue as a matter of necessity (Lindberg et al., 2001) or imposition by a third party (Ap, 1992) .

Thus, power in hospitality becomes relevant to the possession of space and the decision to welcome someone in it or reject someone from entering the space (Derrida and Dufourmantelle, 2000) . The sovereign decisions of inclusion and exclusion are further complexified in light of technological advances which, according to Derrida and Dufourmantelle (2000) , challenge self-identities and decisions by allowing filtering and choosing.

Precision and rigour of the qualitative research sample is defined by its ability to represent salient characteristics (Ritchie et al., 2014) . The rationale of purposive sampling rests on the fact that the researchers, based on their a-priori theoretical understanding of the topic, assume that certain individuals may have important perspectives on the phenomenon in question (Robinson, 2014) . Therefore, to reflect the scope of the study and to ensure closeness of fit to the study focus (Scerri and Presbury, 2020) , the following selection criteria were considered. First, participants had to be active hosts on the Airbnb platform with a substantial number of reviews. Second, the hosts had to be available and willing to participate in the study as well as be able to describe experiences and perceptions (Bernard, 2002) . As such, we opted to select hosts with English proficiency. In addition, the sample was selected with a consideration of participants' backgrounds, age and gender to ensure that enough diversity is included (Ritchie et al., 2014) within the sample. In other words, participants of both genders and various age groups were targeted across different locations in Europe whereas efforts were undertaken to ensure that hosts renting different types of properties (i.e. shared room, entire home) were included.

Accordingly, our findings suggest that different types of hosts emerge in accordance to the motive and the type of property offered (Table 2) . While hosts sharing a room in their property are primarily motivated by the social benefits of the interaction, others with more listings appear to be economically-driven. Specifically, our findings identify the emergence of a new breed of entrepreneurs, perceiving the affordances of the platform as a technical infrastructure and the rules embedded in it as a 'business proposition' offered by Airbnb. This business proposition is attractive to potential hosts because of its low cost and convenience of initial 'setting up shop' process. Most importantly, it appears to empower individual hosts by assigning them control over the host-guest relationship. Although professional service providers are entering P2P accommodation, it is unclear how many exist on Airbnb due to legislation being ambiguous over the point at which a peer becomes a professional service provider (Newlands et al., 2018) .

Host practices reflect host perceptions over roles and identities (i.e. professionals vs peers) which are important in determining their approach to negotiating the hospitality exchange (Farmaki et al., 2020a (Farmaki et al., , 2020b . On the outset, informants shared similar views on the importance of providing a safe, clean and functional environment and being 'hospitable'. Some informants referred to tangible elements (e.g. good quality toiletries) as representing the quality service offered while others discussed their hosting practice in more abstract terms, suggesting that \"if you treat guests as you treat your friends and family, you can't go wrong\" (Gloria). Specifically, \"being friendly, polite and treating guests as if they are special\" (Matt) was mentioned as a key aspect of hospitableness, which in P2P accommodation represents an important dimension influencing the guest experience Mody et al., 2019) . However, as discussion moved on, it became apparent that host practices in Airbnb are to a great extent non-standardized with the conditions under which accommodation resources are shared with guests emerging as influential. For example, hosts renting out their entire property(ies) tend to maintain a more commercial-oriented exchange with guests, offering services that are comparable to hotels (i.e. cleaning service). As Alice said, \"I might leave a teddy bear as a gift if the guest travels with young children\u2026often I leave traditional sweets for guests to take as souvenirs\". The primary motives for offering such services is mostly economic as hosts expressed a desire to improve their rating \"through more positive reviews\" (Matt).

Neil noted that \"hotels don't have the luxury to screen guests\" highlighting the flexibility offered by P2P platforms. P2P platforms have significant information about guests (e.g. profile, reviews) that the host requires in order to make an informed decision as to whether to accept or reject guests.

Guests seem to hold power over hosts through the search and review mechanisms that Airbnb offers; if hosts want to have a good search placement then they need to respond to guest demands and improve their ratings. Services offered by the platform -such as 'Airbnb For Everyone' which allows guests to book rooms in boutique hotels and B&Bs and 'Airbnb Plus' or 'Airbnb Luxe' that include elite properties offering luxury experiencesonly add to the demands of guests by influencing perceptions over the services offered by Airbnb hosts. Although the superhost and superguest programmes represent the means through which 'reward power' may be exercised by hosts and guests as in the case of hotels (Liang et al., 2017) , they also reflect Airbnb's efforts to exercise 'referent power' (French et al., 1959) . While Airbnb appears to be adding both hosts and guests in these 'elite' groups in order to maintain stability, in essence it exercises 'power over' hosts through subtle forms of control Lukes (1974) in the form of co-option (Nye, 2008) . Evidently, the agenda of power (Lukes, 2005) is shaped by guests' increasing expectationsto which Airbnb contributesthereby leaving hosts unable to resist if they want to continue benefiting financially. Indeed, the majority of economically-driven hosts appear to comply either passively or more actively to the platform's changing policies, as they feel compelled to conform to the changing environment by maximizing their belongingness (Liu and Mattila, 2017) . We demonstrate these 'power over' dynamics diagrammatically in Fig. 1 , which illustrates how platform policies influence guest expectations, demands and behaviours by favouring a guest-oriented approach that, in turn, impacts host practices.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 748, "end": 768, "text": "(Liang et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 835, "end": 856, "text": "(French et al., 1959)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1058, "text": "Lukes (1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1095, "text": "(Nye, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1142, "text": "(Lukes, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1559, "text": "(Liu and Mattila, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1625, "end": 1631, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "From empowered to powerless: 'Power over' hosts"}, {"text": "Despite the powerlessness expressed by many informants, there were others who acknowledged the financial benefits derived from the hosting activity on Airbnb as an enabling factor that empowers them with additional income and unprecedented employment opportunities.

Guest safety, in particular, emerged as a concern for several hosts who were unaware of the extent of their accountability with regard to guests' wellbeing. For example, Carolina mentioned that while Airbnb may cover damages to the property, it is not clear \"what ensues if something happens to guests\" particularly to \"older guests who may have health problems\" (Matthew). In this regard, the role of the platform was identified as important in mediating between the hosts and guests (Cheng and Foley, 2018) particularly when problems, uncertainties and/or conflicts arise. Within this context, many hosts emphasised that Airbnb is becoming increasingly more \"difficult to reach\" (Helen) expressing feelings that the platform \"does not support hosts when needed\" (Joseph).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 917, "end": 940, "text": "(Cheng and Foley, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emerging hosting practice identity: 'Power to' hosts"}, {"text": "Correspondingly, as our findings reveal, different types of hosts (e.g. professional individuals, cohabiting hosts) are attempting to gain control over the host-guest relationship through self-regulatory tactics. This occurs primarily by setting up informal online groups through which they may exchange knowledge and support one another. Specifically, our study indicates that the participation of hosts in forums and discussion groups represents a 'community of practice' through which issues are explored and, subsequently exploited, leading to a standardization of host practice (Fig. 2) . In Neil's words, \"we got together informally as hosts and talked about our experiences, sought the knowledge of more experienced hosts from San Francisco where Airbnb started and tried to influence change\". There are several Airbnb host groups on social networks in which \"members self-organize\u2026 getting an accountant and a legal advisor to provide some direction and guidance\" (Gloria). In the midst of an increasingly competitive yet unregulated environment, hosts form online communities exchange and produce knowledge which in turn informs their hosting practice and reproduces an institutional identity that, as Foucault (1980) would argue, is embedded in their power relations with guests and the platform itself as it formalises hosting practice.

The decision of these hosts to exit the platform or even switch platforms reflects a form of 'power to' strategy. As Karl commented, \"I recently moved to a smaller platform as I think it is more nurturing towards hosts\u2026it attracts a specific type of guest that I am more interested in hosting\". Interestingly, our study identified some hosts who seem to by-pass the Airbnb platform \"by finalizing bookings with guests in social networks like Facebook\" (Nick). Evidently, it appears that hosts are exercising power by resisting the changes in Airbnb's policies, opting to cease the hospitality exchange with guests in P2P platforms. In this regard, it is worth highlighting the duality of guest-host roles that several Airbnb members may have which indicates that they often alternate between the roles of 'power holder' to 'power subject' (Wrong, 1995) .

Hence, Airbnb has 'legitimate power' (French et al., 1959) as it is the largest and fastest growing P2P accommodation network. The decision to stay on the platform though is not exclusive to economically-driven hosts. Co-habiting hosts, for example, expressed a sense of pride behind their involvement in Airbnb. In Ciska's words, \"Airbnb is growing and it's great being part of that community\". Similarly, Gloria commented that \"it feels good to know that people want to visit you and that you are doing a good job hosting them\". For these hosts, the ability to gain a superhost title represents a form of psychological enhancement with many informants highlighting the positive aspects of the growth of Airbnb that might \"potentially help individuals to gain more money in a flexible way\" (Doreen).

Recently, Airbnb -the world's largest P2P accommodation platform -has introduced initiatives which opened up the platform space to professional accommodation providers while attempting to target an up-market clientele through the offering of high-quality and/ or luxury accommodation experiences. Such attempts signal a departure from the initial philosophy of P2P accommodation as a sharing economy sector (Crommelin et al., 2018) complexifying the host-guest relationship.

First, findings identify different types of Airbnb hosts including emerging professionals managing multiple listings, individual economicallydriven hosts managing one or two listings and co-habiting hosts that are either more economically-focused or socially-oriented. In turn, different groups of hosts have different approaches to hosting. While some elements (i.e. clean, functional space, politeness etc) are considered necessary by all host types, professional and economically-oriented hosts tend to offer hotel style services contrary to co-habiting hosts who follow a varied approach to hosting, with some even expecting their guests to contribute to cleaning and maintaining the property. Hence, findings show how the hospitality exchange emerges as a negotiated act between the host and the guest (Farmaki et al., 2020a (Farmaki et al., , 2020b particularly when co-habitation exists; thus, confirming the prevalence of power in determining hospitality encounters in such contexts.

Correspondingly, power shifts are noticeable in the P2P accommodation setting in the form of a: a) 'power over' relationship emerges between hosts, guests and the platform wherein the host practice is indirectly controlled through the platform's changing policies and in accordance to guest preferences and b) 'power to' Airbnb hosts relationship emerges as the platform continues to economically empower individuals across the world, given its legitimacy as the largest and most successful network.

Specifically, study findings point towards a heterogeneity among individual hosts in relation to their hosting motive and property type, which subsequently influences their degree of professionalism (see Table 2 ). In relation to this point, our findings identify the emergence of a new breed of entrepreneurs as an increasing number of individuals see the Airbnb platform as a space of entrepreneurship that is low cost, convenient and easy to use. Moreover, our study sheds light on how different Airbnb host types adopt varying hosting practices, ranging from standardized hospitality activities that are analogous to hotel services to offerings wherein the guest is expected to share the responsibility of certain activities (i.e. cleaning). The study reveals that the P2P accommodation service is becoming more professionalized and aligned to the standards of the traditional hospitality sector as a result of platform features. In particular, Airbnb seems to mediate the relations between the host and the guest through its policies, guidelines and regulations (see Fig. 1 ). As our findings indicate, the platform's guest-oriented approach is reinforcing guest expectations of host practice, adding pressures on hosts while leading to power shifts within P2P accommodation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 144, "text": "Guttentag, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 145, "end": 163, "text": "Moon et al., 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 164, "end": 183, "text": "Zhang et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 524, "end": 531, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1398, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Theoretical implications"}, {"text": "Specifically, findings reveal a form of 'power over' relationship between hosts, guests and the platform. Power trajectories are conditioned by the interdependencies among the actors -namely hosts, guests and the platform -who often have a dual role in the P2P practice (e.g. hosts act as guests on occasions). For instance, the platform uses referent and legitimate power to influence host practice (i.e. superhost badge, Airbnb Plus etc) whereas guests exercise influence through the review system. As this study has shown, negative reviews are more damaging to hosts than to guests due to the implications on their search placement. In this context, hosts expressed increasing inability to select guests due to the 'punitive' measures that Airbnb is indirectly imposing if rejection or cancellation of booking occurs. Consequently, the argument that host and guest selection in P2P accommodation is an empowering tool for both parties (Dolnicar, 2017) is being challenged. Specifically, findings suggest that economically-driven hosts are compelled to conform to the changing environment given their economic interests by either adapting their host practice according to platform policies or passively consenting to Airbnb's recommendations by continuing to partly apply individual hosting practices, transferring liability if and when problems arise onto the platform.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 938, "end": 954, "text": "(Dolnicar, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Theoretical implications"}, {"text": "Alternatively, another face of power is identified in this study. A 'power to' hosts is evident through the empowerment opportunities provided by the platform. In this regard, Lukes' (2005) argument that power and powerlessness are inherently linked is of relevance. As findings have shown, Airbnb hosts continue to be both empowered and powerless in their hosting practice; on the one hand, they benefit financially whereas, on the other hand, they are increasingly becoming powerless in their ability to control their hosting practice if they wish to continue receiving the financial benefits emanating from hosting on the platform. Hence, it may be argued that the host-guest relationship in P2P accommodation is characterised by a form of duality as outcomes may be positive and/or negative, depending on the circumstances under which the hospitality exchange occurs and, most importantly, how members perceive and respond to power shifts. For example, several hosts seem to retaliate when they undertake the role of the 'guest' by attempting to exercise power through a demanding attitude. As such, it appears that hosts themselves are contributing to the continuing growth of guest demands when they alternate roles (Wrong, 2017) ; therefore, remining us that the 'power subject' may in fact become a 'power holder' in specific circumstances.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 189, "text": "Lukes' (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1235, "text": "(Wrong, 2017)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Theoretical implications"}, {"text": "An additional form of 'power to' arises from host-to-host information sharing (see Fig. 2 ).

As this study demonstrated, host-to-host information sharing practices are part of a 'power to' activity that is of particular importance given the absence of a regulatory framework on P2P accommodation and the non-standardized nature of hosting practice. Even so, while many hosts are forced to align their practice to these changing policies of the platform, others are unable to respond as they often lack the necessary resources or may be unwilling to conform to the changing environment. Within this context, 'power to' is evidenced in the decision of several hosts to exit the Airbnb platform, ceasing their hosting activity altogether or switching to alternative smaller platforms; hence, challenging the drivers of hosting on Airbnb.

By showing the power shifts noticeable in P2P accommodation, the framework may offer practical value to hosts by allowing them to self-identify with a specific host type and relevant strategy to respond to the power dynamics impacting their hosting practice. In addition, the communities of practice that we see emerging around hosting may use the framework as a training tool to support new hosts joining the platform and help them to understand the challenges in setting up and operating their hosting practice. Generally, the framework illustrates the emergence of a form of hybrid P2P accommodation based on a professional hospitality type of service that correspondingly attracts semi-professional individuals, pursuing entrepreneurial activities on P2P platforms. As such, new identities and understandings of hospitality practices are emerging (Farmaki et al., 2020a (Farmaki et al., , 2020b indicating that the face of traditional hospitality will not remain unaffected by these changes, calling for managers and hospitality leaders to reconsider their offering. Indeed, in light of the popularity of P2P accommodation, hotel managers may need to rethink of their product offering and highlight the social and/or 'home comfort' aspects of hospitality more explicitly by developing a personalised service, reflective of the one that may be offered by some P2P accommodation hosts (e.g. cohabiting hosts).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1247, "end": 1269, "text": "(Farmaki et al., 2020a", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1294, "text": "(Farmaki et al., , 2020b", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Practical implications"}, {"text": "Moreover, the framework may provide practical indications with regard to the governance of the platform.

These changing nuances characterising the P2P accommodation context imply that greater attention is required on consolidating regulation to reflect the different types of hosts, as reflected in this study. Policymakers need to ensure that regulation of the P2P accommodation sector reflects the diversity in host types. This study provides some initial indication that P2P accommodation is in front of a governance challenge that is captured in the discourses of hosts. Although Airbnb appears to exercise loose governance and control over hosts (Constantiou et al., 2017) , its changing growth strategy has had an intentional or unintentional effect on the overall governance of the platform. Subsequently, a reaction by individual hosts has been generated as they seek to raise their selfawareness as a new emerging category of semi-professionals, by starting to build a support community and a practitioner identity. In this regard, individual hosts may emerge as a new potential source of influence that could reshape the future direction of P2P accommodation.

This is particularly evident nowadays as the professed 'disruption' brought about by digital platforms is still underway causing behavioural, strategic, regulatory and other institutional adaptations. In the case of Uber, for instance, we may identify 'power over' and 'power to' aspects. As Rosenblat (2018) argued Uber drivers are pressurized to comply with certain rules (power over) through algorithmic management, while at the same time they are incentivized to contribute as freelancers (power to) who enjoy freedom and flexibility (M\u00f6hlmann and Zalmanson, 2017) .

Hence, insights may be offered by this study beyond the P2P accommodation context by highlighting the power asymmetries brought about by the popularity of P2P platforms at the macro and micro level and their relevant effects on workers, users and traditional industry players. In relation to this point, insights from this study may be used by sharing economy platform leaders and practitioners to set up a support and training mechanism whilst also ensuring that communication between platforms, users and governments is strengthened in order to improve discussions on the value of P2P exchanges to users; thus, adjusting regulation and policy measures that will safeguard the interests of all the parties involved.
