            "text": "The role of lung ultrasound (LUS) in diagnosing pneumonia is well known, and many meta-analyses have reported sensitivity and specificity ranging from 85% to 93% and from 86% to 93%, respectively, especially when LUS examinations are performed by experienced operators. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] As the first reports of computed tomographic (CT) patterns of coronavirus pneumonia showed a typical involvement of peripheral areas of the lung, 6 and the first article described the principal ultrasound (US) features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in comparison with CT findings, the possible role of US needed to be taken into consideration in the diagnostic process because of its safety, repeatability, absence of radiation, low cost and point-of-care use. 7 As the epidemic began to spread in Italy, the role of LUS was immediately reported by the first colleagues in northern Italy who were engaged in fighting the epidemic. 8 As recently reported, chest US is largely diffuse in particular amid pulmonologists in the northern area of Italy. 9 The Italian thoracic US community has contributed in reporting and encouraging the use of LUS through journal letters 10-12 and video tutorials. 13 As the pretriage evaluation of patients suspected of having COVID-19 started in the Hospital of Bolzano in South Tyrol, Italy, a diagnostic protocol was established, suggesting the indications for performing CT in patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia with negative chest x-ray results. Unfortunately, the route to the CT scanner was not a \"clean\", dedicated route, and the potentially contagious patient could pose a high risk of contagion for many other health care workers. Moreover, in the new COVID-19 intensive care unit, the imaging monitoring of patients with COVID-19 had the same difficulties.",

Except for the limit of the availability of an expert unit, we think that this model, which did not require high costs or additional instrumentation, could be exported to every health care setting and could be easily applied, especially where resources are limited and there is an increasing need to solve a clinical problem.",
