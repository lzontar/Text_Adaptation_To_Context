            "text": "In humans, idiopathic mass lesions with accompanying inflammation have been broadly classified as pseudotumors. These lesions often have the ability to mimic a neoplastic process and frequently involve the orbital region. Pseudotumors and orbital pseudotumor have only rarely been reported in the veterinary literature. A lacrimal pseudotumor involving the lower lacrimal canaliculus has been reported in a dog. 1 In cats, a case of idiopathic orbital pseudotumor has been described, which was characterized by fibrosis, whereas a case of exophthalmia has also been reported associated with eosinophilic infiltration of the orbit. 2, 3 Orbital pseudotumor is a relatively common orbital syndrome in humans with potentially differing etiologies leading to the same clinical presentation. [4] [5] [6] Diagnosis is generally confirmed only with histopathology, and variations include the presence of a vasculitis as well as the degree of orbital inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrovascular response. 4, 6, 7 However, there is a lack of universal definition with a range of findings described. The predominance of a polymorphous cellular infiltrate composed of mature lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and eosinophils, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is often considered indicative of a more acute presentation. In comparison, subacute and chronic forms of orbital pseudotumors are characterized by the formation of increasing amounts of fibrovascular stroma (fibrosclerosis).",

            "text": "The extent of fibrosclerosis observed histopathologically in some cases of orbital pseudotumor is poorly understood. Initially, this change was considered to represent the progression of nonspecific orbital inflammation from acute to chronic stages. One study demonstrated eosinophils in orbital tissue of cases with a predominance of fibrosis and occasionally an accompanying peripheral blood eosinophilia. 8 The observation of extracellular eosinophilic major basic protein deposition by immunofluorescence staining in affected orbits was also considered important. 8, 9 Eosinophilic major basic protein has been demonstrated to be cytotoxic to cells in vitro and consequently the eosinophil may be a participant in the inflammation and fibrosis. 9 However, several reports now suggest that idiopathic sclerosing inflammation of the orbit is a distinctive clinicopathologic entity. 5,10-12 Many cases do not apparently pass through a prior acute inflammatory stage. This subgroup of pseudotumors is characterized by insidious, frequently progressive fibrosis that damages orbital structures primarily through cicatricial entrapment. 5, 6, 12 In contrast to acute presentations, response to corticosteroid treatment or radiotherapy is usually incomplete, with relapses and visual impairment as common complications. 5, 12 Histologically, affected tissue demonstrates extensive fibroplasia associated with an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells and occasional histiocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, and is suggestive of a primary immunologically mediated fibrosis. It has been speculated that extensive fibrosclerotic change in some cases may be related to other systemic diseases associated with fibrosis, including retroperitoneal fibrosis and Riedel's thyroiditis. [13] [14] [15] [16] Because of the limited number of cases described in the veterinary literature, it is difficult to compare the condition reported in humans with the occasional case reports in cats although similarities are apparent. We report seven cats examined between 1997 and 2002 with clinical and pathologic findings consistent with idiopathic sclerosing inflammatory pseudotumor of the orbit as described in humans. The cases were retrospectively reviewed to determine demographic and clinical features, clinical course, management, and outcome. We correlated clinical findings and pathologic features to describe this condition in cats and discuss possible treatment modalities.",

Three cats received systemic antibiotics with one cat receiving marbofloxacin (Marbocyl; Vetoquinol UK Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK) at a dose of 2 mg/kg for 2 weeks, one cat receiving 22.7 mg of enrofloxacin (Baytril; Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Berkshire, UK) twice daily for 3 weeks and two cats receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate (Clavamox; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA, USA) at a dose of 15 mg/kg twice daily for up to 5 weeks. One cat received both enrofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Topical management included lubrication in four cats including a gel lubricant (Viscotears; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Surrey, UK) and a paraffin-based ointment (Lacrilube; Allergan, Buckinghamshire, UK). Triple antibiotic ointment (neomycin, polymixin B sulfate, bacitracin zinc ophthalmic ointment; E.

Surgery was undertaken because of chronic pain or disease progression with samples submitted for pathological examination. Pathological findings were similar in each case with an infiltrative diffuse mass lesion encircling the globe. Findings suggested that the clinical presentation was a combination of cicatricial change involving orbital tissue and mass effect resulting in reduced ocular motility and exposure keratitis. The intraocular inflammation observed in several cases was attributed to the presence of keratitis. In cases where adnexal material was available, the same disease process was observed in the eyelids and third eyelid.

A predominance of fibrous tissue over inflammatory cells was observed in affected orbits in the current study and a subgroup of orbital pseudotumor in humans is also associated with fibrous tissue infiltration. In humans it is important to exclude systemic diseases, which can involve the orbit and mimic orbital pseudotumor. These include systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, neoplasia, infection, lipidosis, and foreign body reaction. 7 Idiopathic sclerosing orbital pseudotumor is rarely reported in the veterinary literature and a diagnosis should be based on exclusion of other orbital diseases. It is important to note that fine needle aspirates of orbital contents were not diagnostic in any of the cases in which it was performed. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and serology for known infectious diseases failed to reveal a pattern in affected cats. Of most use in diagnosis was imaging of the orbit as well as history and familiarity with the disease presen-tation. No evidence of systemic disease was identified in the cats included in the current study. Although a complete postmortem examination was only permitted in one cat, the clinical and histological findings did not support a diagnosis of malignancy or microbial infection in the cases presented in this report. A foreign body reaction was also considered unlikely because of the bilateral and progressive nature of the condition and absence of histology consistent with a foreign body reaction.",

In this cat, vision loss was attributed to a total retinal detachment histologically. Partial retinal detachment was also observed in three other eye specimens, potentially a result of scleral compression and local disruption of transretinal fluid flow. It is perhaps surprising that more cats in the current study were not reported with visual impairment. However, visual assessment is difficult in cats and it is possible that subtle visual and pupillary deficits may have gone undetected. Certainly, the constricting nature of the sclerosis and posterior pole location could have also caused visual deficits from optic nerve compression without clinically detectable pupillary deficits.",

One case also received local radiation therapy. All treatments appeared to have little or no effect on the course of the disease in cats. This poor effect may reflect the institution of treatment after the disease process was well entrenched and difficult to reverse, although only antiinflammatory doses of corticosteroids were used. The grave prognosis and poor response to treatment indicate the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive management. Immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids or use of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, should be considered.",

The pathological findings are similar to idiopathic orbital sclerosing pseudotumor in humans and therefore the condition may represent a primary fibrosis rather than progression of acute inflammation. The insidious nature of this condition may contribute to the late presentation and diagnosis in cats. Accurate diagnosis of this disorder and further attempts to identify underlying pathogens such as FHV, autoimmune disorders, and aberrant production of fibrogenic cytokines (e.g., fibroblast growth factor, TGF-\u03b2 ) will contribute to defining this disease in the cat. Future studies directed at instigating immunosuppressive or radiation therapy earlier in the course of the disease are warranted.",
