During the year, the Editorial Board was joined by Akbar Dastjerdi who has been handling many papers on, amongst others, herpes viruses.",

The two most downloaded original submissions are articles on white spot syndrome virus, a prawn pathogen, and on BSE infectivity [3, 6] . The two most downloaded brief reports were an article on African swine fever virus variants in Poland and on dengue fever in Guangdong province in China [1, 2] . The service to the community of the journal is amply illustrated by the high number of papers on taxonomy from the Virology Division of the IUMS and the ICTV that were published and downloaded in 2019.",

Over 100 scientists from all over the world came together in Vienna to discuss current events in virology and listen to the eleven outstanding lectures from the invited speakers. True to the remit of the journal to cover all aspects of virology, the topics covered plant viruses, animal viruses, human viruses, anti-viral screening, vaccine development and trials as well as viral evolution. Adrian Fox (Fera, York, UK) illustrated how difficult it is to show that a detected plant virus is actually the causative agent of the symptoms identified in the host plant. Linda Dixon (Pirbright Institute, Woking, UK) illustrated both the need for a vaccine to control African swine fever virus and the problems associated with developing one. Marie-Paule Kieny (Inserm, Paris, France) in contrast reported on the logistical and ethical problems associated with the clinical development of Ebola vaccines during the West African Ebola virus epidemic in 2014 and the current one in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The judicious use of the currently unlicensed vaccine based on vesicular stomatitis virus is one reason why the current epidemic in the DRC appears to be close to being extinguished.",

Detlev Kr\u00fcger (Charit\u00e9 Hospital, Berlin, Germany) explained the background to the paper \"Die Bedeutung der \u00dcbermikroskopie f\u00fcr die Virusforschung\" (Importance of ultramicroscopy for virus research) by Helmut Ruska, Bodo v. Borries and Ernst Ruska [4] . This method allowed Helmut Ruska to image virus particles and to establish their size. In a further publication in \"Archiv f\u00fcr die gesamte Virusforschung\", Helmut Ruska went on to suggest a method for classifying virus types based on their structural properties [5] and to note that viruses, unlike bacteria, did not divide. 80 years following the paper of the Ruska cousins and v. Borries, both Sarah Butcher (University of Helsinki, Finland) and Susan Hafenstein (Pennsylvania State University, Philadelphia, USA) explained how the techniques of cryo-electron microscopy had been developed further to enable atomic resolution of viral particles such as those from human parechoviruses and human papillomaviruses. Butcher looked into how small anti-viral compounds could bind to the human parechovirus and coxsackievirus particles. In contrast, Hafenstein used the structures of human papillomavirus to look into the at present unknown stoichiometry and positioning of the small L2 protein relative to the large L1 particle that make up the infectious virion. This knowledge should enable more efficient vaccines against papillomaviruses to be made.",

Alexandra Trkola (University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) presented studies from cohorts of HIV positive patients in Switzerland that examined factors responsible for the generation of broadly neutralising antibodies against HIV. In conclusion, she suggested that the use of closed trimers of the HIV glycoprotein gp120 would be the best immunogen known at present for the induction of such broadly neutralising antibodies. Quentin Sattentau (University of Oxford, UK) showed videos of cell biological experiments to visualise the importance of cell-cell transmission of HIV particles that can take place amongst T-cells and between T-cells and macrophage. It will be an important challenge for any HIV vaccine to be able to induce antibodies that prevent such transmission events.",

            "text": "Wendy Barclay (Imperial College, London, UK) examined the response of influenza A virus strains to the host to demonstrate that a specific mutation found in the polymerase of human influenza virus strains was necessary to interact with a host nuclear protein to ensure productive replication of the influenza RNA genome. She also noted that the mildly acidic environment of the human respiratory tract was a barrier that had to be crossed by avian influenza strains to infect the human lung and was able to describe mutations in the hemagglutinin molecule that produced more stable avian influenza strains better adapted to the human respiratory environment. As Jolanda Smit (University of Groningen, The Netherlands) reported, dengue and chikungunya viruses are also important pathogens for human health; for instance, dengue virus infects about 400 million people per year. One feature of dengue virus immunity that compromises the generation of a vaccine against all four dengue serotypes is the ability of antibodies against one serotype to enhance infection with a second serotype. Smit described experiments showing that the only partially neutralised second serotype could enter macrophages using a different pathway from that used by virus that was not bound to antibodies.",

            "text": "Edward Holmes (University of Sydney, Australia) gave the final lecture on how metagenomics is bringing us new information on the virome of our planet. Using new-generation sequencing, Holmes could show that lower vertebrates harbour a huge number of viral species, with members of the families of the picornaviruses, the caliciviruses and reoviruses being especially frequent. Holmes speculated that the stability of the non-enveloped, icosahedral particles of viruses from these families may be one reason for their abundance. Taking all his metagenomics studies on viruses found in unicellular organisms, arthropods, birds and humans, Holmes concluded by estimating that the virome on planet Earth comprises of around 100 million viral species. There will therefore be plenty of work in the future for virologists and no shortage of papers for publishing in Archives of Virology.",

Archives of Virology will continue publishing high-quality research on virology in the coming years, with however one important administrative change. At the beginning of 2020, the editorial office of the journal will move from the Spring-erNature office in Vienna to the SpringerNature Office in London. I wish to thank all my colleagues at the Vienna office for their support since I became editor of Archives of Virology in 2004 and even more since becoming editor-inchief in 2018 as well as for their help in organising the two recent symposia in 2018 and 2019.",
