We found a few studies providing some data on the neonatal pertussis disease burden in South and Southeast Asia (Table 2) . Importantly, most of the data were obtained from hospital-based retrospective studies describing a series of pertussis cases that do not give actual incidence. Official statistics were difficult to obtain for most countries as mandatory pertussis surveillance systems based on active reporting are not well established in the region. Existing surveillance systems in the region rely on passive reporting where most cases are known to go unreported [26] . However, even in countries where disease reporting is mandatory, the pertussis burden may be underestimated. This is because the diagnosis of pertussis is challenging, especially in neonates, as other respiratory pathogens cause pertussislike illnesses and the clinical presentation of pertussis varies. The situation is further complicated by the fact that case definitions for pertussis vary across countries [27] (refer to Table 3 for an overview of case definitions for the different age groups used for pertussis). Moreover, specific guidelines for the diagnosis of neonatal pertussis are not yet available, and existing recommendations are targeted at older children. In addition, most neonatal deaths occur outside the hospital environment; Serology (IgG-PT), if C 1 year after pertussis vaccination therefore, it is also difficult to ascertain and report the true causes of neonatal deaths. Accurate laboratory identification of B. pertussis remains problematic [28] [29] [30] [31] . Clinically accurate laboratory diagnostic tests are essential for the confirmation of pertussis and can be done via culture, direct-fluorescent-antibody testing, serology and PCR. Although PCR is a robust detection method, assays are expensive, and this technique has usually been unavailable on a routine basis in Asia. Factors such as the widespread availability of antibiotics and initiation of treatment prior to sample collection contribute to the increasing number of negative cultures and further hampers disease detection [7, 26] .

Under this scheme, the first dose was administered as early as 6 weeks of age, and subsequent doses were provided within 6 months [32] . While coverage has improved, many countries have added vaccination boosters beyond the primary doses with the main aim of reducing the high disease burden in the most vulnerable populations. However, recent trends in the resurgence of pertussis across the age groups pose an urgent need to protect newborns [33] , especially during the time window between birth and completion of the primary vaccination schedule (please see ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 258, "end": 262, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 572, "end": 576, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current Scenario of Pertussis Vaccination"}, {"text": "IgG immunoglobulin G, PCR polymerase chain reaction, PT pertussis toxin, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, WBC white blood cell a In areas where PCR is not available, samples may be sent for culture confirmation to reference laboratories b False negatives are possible c Serology not informative in this age cohort Source: Adapted from Cherry et al. [63] https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7951187) [34] . A resurgence in pertussis disease has led to a shift in primary pertussis prevention that has relied on infant immunization to protection by cocooning, i.e., vaccination of close contacts of newborn infants (new mothers, fathers, grandparents, siblings, caretakers, etc.), thereby reducing the risk of pertussis exposure for newborns. Cocooning programs, though effective, have had limited success and are not costeffective [35] . Immunization of women during pregnancy rather than during the immediate postpartum period (the initial cocooning recommendation) is a better approach by directly providing protection through transplacental transfer of maternal vaccine-induced antibodies [35, 36] . Evidence from clinical trials and preliminary surveillance data suggests that maternal vaccination is well tolerated in pregnant women, fetuses and newborns and is effective in protecting the latter against pertussis [37] [38] [39] [40] . While immunization during pregnancy offers several benefits, few studies have shown that maternally derived immunoglobulin G antibodies cause blunting of the infant antibody responses for the same or related antigens after primary vaccination [41, 42] . The clinical relevance of blunting is not apparent, and further investigation of blunting on pregnant women and infants is required [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 399, "end": 403, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1095, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1099, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1323, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1328, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1333, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1338, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1584, "end": 1588, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1592, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1731, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Serology (IgG-PT), if C 1 year after pertussis vaccination"}, {"text": "In 2011, the Tdap (reduced antigen quantity) vaccine was recommended in unvaccinated pregnant women by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) [35] .

Considering this situation in well-developed countries, the pertussis burden is likely to be much higher in lowand middle-income countries [26] .

Multiple strategies to increase vaccine uptake should be considered to increase protection in infants, such as dissemination of information and education about the disease and the need for prevention in this vulnerable population [51, 59, 60] . A study reported that in Korea 95.1% of women surveyed received information from doctors about Tdap vaccination and that 81.2% of them were not aware of the need for vaccination.
