[3] [4] [5] The GI bill marked the beginning of governmental subsidies for teaching hospitals. Stipends were increased and residency positions increased by six fold during 1940-1960, with increased insurance charges covering the increasing costs of technology, facilities, and educational expenses. 3 The Social Security Amendments of 1965 created the Medicare program, which endeavored to provide support for new physicians until \"the community undertakes to bear such education costs in some other way\". 6, 7 This funding was provided through cost-based reimbursement determined by the hospital's historical and reasonable costs and was expected to cover resident stipends, faculty salaries, and other educational expenses with no determined limits. 4",

            "text": "The early 1980s saw increased regulation and oversight of federal dollars paying for GME. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) was created in 1981, which assured the quality of resident education through its resident review committees. In the 1980s, two congressional actions led to the separate mechanisms of indirect graduate medical education (IME) payments and direct graduate medical education (DME) payments. 8 This change occurred with the implementation of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) in the early 1980s. 1 DME continued to cover direct costs and was calculated as the average number of fulltime equivalent (FTE) positions multiplied by the per resident amount multiplied by the hospital percentage of Medicare inpatient days ( Figure 1 ). The 1985 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) set the per resident amount and limited DME reimbursement to residents in their initial residency period or 5 years, whichever was shorter. Subsequent subspecialty training only counted as 0.5 FTE.4 IME was created with the understanding that teaching hospitals incur greater costs as compared to non-teaching hospitals due to increased testing, specialized infrastructure for patients and research, and a more complex patient mix. IME is calculated with a curvilinear formula that includes the ratio of interns/residents to beds and a national cost multiplier set by Medicare legislation. 3 Growing concerns about skyrocketing national healthcare costs led increased attention to federal GME funding. At that time, if a hospital were to add a resident, it would receive additional Medicare funding to support that resident. Additionally, the amount of per resident reimbursement through DME varied drastically between hospitals -in 1995 it ranged from $10,000 to $240,000 per resident with a median value of $65,000. 3 The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established a \"cap\" on the number of residents eligible for Medicare GME reimbursement based on the hospital's reported resident FTE in 1996. 4 This act was supported by six major medical organizations in the setting of a shared understanding that the United States was predicted to have a severe oversupply of physicians. 6 To address the wide variation between the per resident amount used to calculate DME, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 established a floor and ceiling for the per resident amount, which was 70% and 140% of the national average per resident amount, respectively.",

            "text": "With national efforts at deficit reduction and new evidence that the United States is facing a physician shortage rather than a surplus, GME funding reform has been targeted for reform by medical societies and governmental agencies. In 2006, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) reversed its position regarding physician oversupply, and recommended increasing medical student enrollment by 30%. 6 The AAMC cited the failure of tightly organized managed-care plans becoming the primary delivery model of US healthcare as the cause of this change in opinion. Efforts to reduce the federal costs of GME funding continued with the bipartisan 2010 Simpson Bowles commission report, which recommended a 50% reduction in IME funding over a 10-year period and capping DME payments at 120% the 2010 national average. 1 This commission followed a 2010 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report stating that only 40-45% of IME payments were attributable to higher patient care costs of Medicare patients. In response, the ACGME surveyed designated institutional officials and estimated that these changes would cause 28% of all GME programs to close. 9 In efforts to reduce federal contributions to GME and reform convoluted reimbursement schemes, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM, previously the Institute of Medicine, IOM) commissioned a study to review GME funding. In their 2014 report, the NAM recommended maintaining aggregate Medicare IME/DME funding, but instead distributing the monies into two subsidiary funds -an Operational Fund for support of current residency training positions and a Transformation Fund for innovation through piloting alternative GME payment methods and funding new GME positions in \"priority disciplines and geographic areas\". 10 This was met with criticism by the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine (AAIM) and the American College of Physicians (ACP), who asserted that the report did not recognize the impending physician shortage. The AAIM and ACP published a joint position paper recommending lifting GME caps, spreading the cost of GME among all payers, combining DME and IME, and increasing GME funding transparency. 11 GME funding reform was prioritized in President Trump's Department of Health and Human Services Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Budget proposal, stating \"current graduate medical education funding is outdated, overly broad, and not sustainable long term due to its fragmented nature across multiple funding streams and lack of transparency and accountability.\" 12 Since FY 2019, the federal HHS budget has proposed to consolidate federal GME funding from Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Hospital GME (CHGME) program into one grant program that distributes payments to hospitals based on the number of residents and Medicare and Medicaid inpatient days. This grant program will be managed jointly by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). These changes aim to save $48.1 billion over 10 years. 13 In the FY 2021 budget, legislative proposals aim to reduce GME payments to FY 2017 levels of Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Hospital GME program spending, with adjustments for inflation and plans for growth at 1 percent below inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) ( Figure 2 ).",

Four additional funding streams for GME include the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the HRSA, the Department of Defense (DoD), and private healthcare insurers. The VA, under affiliation agreements, pays for the salary, benefits and a portion of the indirect costs of trainees rotating at their facilities. The HRSA funds 3 federal programs that support residents -the CHGME payment program supporting pediatric residents, the Affordable Care Act's Teaching Health Center GME program that supports primary care residents, and the Title VII Health Professions program that is directed at primary care residents in hopes that they ultimately practice in healthcare shortage areas. The DoD supports GME programs through the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

The wide range in estimated PCP shortfall represents the unknown impact of the projected rapid growth in supply of advanced practice registered nurses (APRN) and physician assistants (PAs). Maldistribution of physicians has been well described in the primary care as well as surgical specialties. 16, 17 The uneven geographic distribution of general surgeons has been found to be mirrored by the regional distribution of categorical general surgery PGY1 positions. 17 Additionally, the Medicare per resident amount exhibits striking state level variation with payments ranging from $63,000-$155,000 per person in Louisiana and Connecticut, respectively ( Figure 4) . 18 This state level variation cannot be fully explained by payment formulas and characteristics of each state's health system. Historically, the development of GME in the first half of the 20th century occurred in the northeast.

Currently, Medicare is the largest funder of GME, but policy efforts have aimed to reduce federal funding for GME. The AAIM and ACP report recommend that all payers of the health care systempublic and private -should be required to contribute to a financing pool supporting residencies. 11 Gold et al. suggested creating an all-payer system for GME and undergraduate medical education (UME) with a \"tuition-for-service\" program to eliminate medical student debt for those who work in underserved areas and specialties following completion of GME training. 19 Others have proposed billing private insurance for unsupervised minor procedures performed by trainees. 20 Given concerns that current residency graduates are poorly trained in skills needed in the current practice environment such as quality improvement and care coordination, there has been interest in performance-based GME payments on metrics such as value of care, access, and physician wellbeing. The AAIM and ACP remain cautious that these changes should not occur without rigorous research and input from multiple stakeholders, including physicians in training. 11, 21 It estimated the average medical resident makes $61,200 yearly, with average post graduate year 1 (PGY-1) salary $55,200. 23 Over 50% of residents did not feel like they were fairly compensated, with over 50% stating they were dissatisfied with compensation because it does not reflect the number of hours worked (86%), is not comparable to that of other medical staff (72%), or does not reflect the required skill level (69%). 44% of surveyed residents felt compensation does not meet the cost of living. Over 60% said they feel they should make at least 25% more in compensation, with 41% of residents stating that potential earnings were extremely or very influential in specialty choice. Interestingly, these data showed more men than women reported that potential earnings have a very strong influence on specialty choice (47% vs. 31%, respectively). 23 A gender disparity in salary expectations was also found in a recent study by Gray et al which found that female general surgery residents had lower expectations compared with men in minimum starting salary ($249,502 vs. $267,700) and viewed salary negotiation less favorably. 24",

A study of 29,134 cases performed at Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina showed that 45 out of 246 procedures took significantly longer with a resident present in the room. Procedure time increased on average by 4.8 minutes and was estimated to cost $9.57 per minute. 32 This difference was replicated when residents were incorporated into a community hospital where attending surgeons had previously been operating without a resident. 33 Increased operative time was found to be associated with level of experience. In a study of 1063 cases, mastectomies took significantly longer when PGY1-3 residents were involved, but the difference disappeared by Conversely, studies have uniformly found significant costs associated with replacing residents with faculty and advanced practice practitioners (APPs) like Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and physicians assistants (PAs). 27,35-37 Pisetsky et al found that replacing an anesthesiology resident with certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), NPs, and PAs would cost approximately $153,000 over the 3-year training period. 35 A financial value analysis of replacing a 30-position general surgery residency program with APPs would cost $4.5 million, based on a 1:3 senior staff to APP replacement ratio. Replacement with senior staff would approach $9 million. 36 In the aforementioned study by Lauer et al, replacing surgery residents with APPs or hospitalists would cost the health system an additional $16,651,281 or $26,119,281 annually, respectively. 27",
