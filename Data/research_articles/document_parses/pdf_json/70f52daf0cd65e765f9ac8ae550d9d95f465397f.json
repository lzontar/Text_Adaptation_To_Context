A number of in vitro as well as in vivo model animal studies have shown that widely used compound hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is able to cause anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2. While there is no enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have already approved HCQ as treatment and prophylactic option. In the current study we analyzed the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantity change in nasopharynx swabs of infected patients in mild condition and compared that of patients receiving HCQ and receiving no antiviral pharmacological therapy. We found that most of the patients demonstrated gradual decrease in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the swab regardless of the HCQ receiving. Noteworthy that patients with RNA load higher than 10 6 copies were hospitalized due to condition deteriorating significantly more frequently compared to those with RNA load below 10 6 copies even with HCQ administration. In addition, the results of the current study indicate that recovering patients may produce viruses at least during 18 days from the onset of symptoms and HCQ therapy does not block or reduce it.",

Since de novo drug development is a very complicated and longstanding process attempts to find the drug with anti SARS-CoV-2 effects among ones already available on a market are being made due to the urgent need. So, a number of in vitro, as well as in vivo model animal studies have shown well-known and widely available compound hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to have an effect against SARS-CoV-2 [1] [2] [3] . Additionally, there are data on the use of HCQ for patients with severe disease, but the results of these studies are few and contradictory. While there is no enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have already approved HCQ as a treatment for infected patients and as a prophylactic option. In the current study we analyzed the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantity in nasopharynx swabs of infected patients in mild condition and compared that of patients receiving HCQ and receiving no antiviral pharmacological therapy.",

For each sample amplification of two different regions (N2 and N3) of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene was analyzed in duplicates. Serial 10-fold dilutions of synthetic DNA fragments containing N2 and N3 regions were used for standard curve generation and linear relationship between Ct values and amplicon copy number was observed for both PCR systems ( Figure 1 ). SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in samples was calculated as the mean of four measurements (two values for N2 and two for N3) and converted to the total volume of the transport media thus reflecting the total viral RNA quantity in swab.",
