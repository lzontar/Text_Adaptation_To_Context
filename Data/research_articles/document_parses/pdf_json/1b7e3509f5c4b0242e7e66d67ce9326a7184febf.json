These two theories look at aspects of the public's cognitive processing. Framing focuses on attributing aspect by highlighting certain expressions or deleting certain words. For instance, when news media emphasize negative perspectives on smoking, the public who are repeatedly exposed to this type of frame view the issue negatively, blaming smokers for causing health risks to nonsmokers (e.g., housewives, schoolchildren, or babies). In other words, the public connects the frame to the blaming of smokers. By contrast, second-level agenda setting examines the accessibility of issues covered by the news media. When newspapers and television networks cover the negative aspects of smoking over time, the public who are exposed to the coverage are likely to recall the attribute and consider it to be an important problem. In other words, agenda setting refers to a process by which the news media influence the accessibility of an issue or an attribute in the public mind, whereas framing indicates a process by which the news media affect the public's perception of an issue, which varies with the presentation of the issue (Scheufele 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1272, "end": 1288, "text": "(Scheufele 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "News frames and healthcare issues"}, {"text": "The New York Times portrayed mad cow disease, bird flu, and West Nile fever in terms of generic frames such as results, action, uncertainty, conflict, and evidence of disease (Shih et al. 2008) .

Thus, healthcare policies related to drugs and medical practices operate in the regulatory dimension. A major issue that affected domestic healthcare policy in Korea was the separation of prescribed and dispensed pharmaceuticals that occurred in 2000. Newspapers assign more legitimacy to the government than to doctors, and newspapers describe doctors as an immoral and unethical group of people who prioritize their personal financial interests (Yang 2001) .

First, national, financial, and specialized newspapers show strikingly similar framing patterns when portraying the issues, which indicates that some underlying rules guide the newspapers' decisions. This implies that institutional rules play a role in newsmaking processes. Second, the nature of an issue is an important factor in the formation of news frames by national, financial, and specialized newspapers. For instance, the policy execution frame did not appear in coverage of the comprehensive medical payment system, swine flu, and humidifier-related lung disease. The medicine frame was absent from coverage of the decrease in pharmaceutical prices, the comprehensive medical payment system, and swine flu. Some frames frequently used by the newspapers for one issue disappeared in the coverage of other issues. The newspapers relied on the conflict frame for describing the decrease in pharmaceutical prices and the comprehensive medical payment system, but the frame was absent from the coverage of swine flu and humidifier-related lung disease. By contrast, the newspapers framed swine flu and humidifier-related lung disease in terms of crisis, but they did not apply the crisis frame to portraying the decrease in pharmaceutical prices and the comprehensive medical payment system.

For instance, with regard to the issue of swine flu, national newspapers, financial newspapers, and specialized newspapers focused on the aspects of patient's choice because they agreed with the value of the frame for coverage of the issue. A focus on patient's choice well serves a mission statement such as protecting the interests of underprivileged groups. The conflict frame is used frequently by the media because it plays an important role in creating valuable news, in that conflict is frequently used to attract audience attention (Neuman et al. 1992) .

Previous research (Yu et al. 2011) states that financial newspapers cover stories from financial or industrial perspectives.

Conflict and economy are major frames for the issue of ''the decrease in pharmaceutical prices,'' and conflict and policy execution are dominant frames for the issue of ''the comprehensive medical payment system.'' The frame of conflict is salient in the stories about these two issues. This means that health journalists approached these two issues by focusing on oppositional relationships between the government and interest groups. The Ministry of Health & Welfare in Korea negotiated with pharmaceutical companies to determine the prices of new medicines. In response to the decrease in prices, pharmaceutical companies filed a lawsuit, arguing that the policy of the decrease would weaken their revenue structure (Jung 2011) .

The stories on ''humidifier-related lung disease'' are framed from the policy execution perspective. This issue is different from the swine flu case, because victims were limited to those who used a humidifier. However, the Korean government did not issue an immediate recall of the product because there was no causal connection between the humidifier and the lung damage.

National, financial, and specialized newspapers adopt similar institutional rules, despite the differences in their organizations. These newspapers rely on three or four frames for covering complicated healthcare policy issues. Accordingly, newspapers frequently fail to provide balanced healthcare information to their readers. If journalists realize that news frames must be understandable to readers, they will also realize that they need to reevaluate the institutional rules concerning the production of healthcare news. Journalists should offer readers multiple perspectives on the nature of policy issues, causes of conflict, and possible solutions.
