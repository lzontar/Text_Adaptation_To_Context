It is well recognized that the addition of SDP to pig feed enhances the immune response and decreases pathogen loads compared with pigs without plasma access through feed. For instance, plasma protein supplements modulated the mucosal immune response in organized and diffuse gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which is accompanied by a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production (Bosi et al., 2004; Nofrarias et al., 2006; P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al., 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 344, "text": "(Pitman and Blumberg, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 345, "end": 365, "text": "Boudry et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 366, "end": 383, "text": "Pie et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 384, "end": 404, "text": "Bailey et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 405, "end": 434, "text": "Moret\u00f3 and P\u00e9rez-Bosque, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 572, "end": 596, "text": "(Grinstead et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 673, "end": 701, "text": "(Torrallardona et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 702, "end": 720, "text": "Bosi et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1125, "text": "(Bosi et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1126, "end": 1149, "text": "Nofrarias et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1150, "end": 1176, "text": "P\u00e9rez-Bosque et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a large enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus in the family"}, {"text": "A Canadian case-control study investigating factors associated with mortality due to porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) found that nursery rations were more likely to contain SDP in control herds compared with clinically affected case herds (Dewey et al., 2006) ; however, alternatively the observed differences may be completely unrelated to the SDP inclusion in the diets.

The challenge was conducted by the same personnel for both groups with approximately 20 min between the two groups. The obtained results could have been by chance due to the group sizes. Alternatively, the BovSDP-PEDV animals could be more prone to excrete PEDV in the early stages in the infection. Unlike in suckling pigs that are very susceptible to PEDV infection, only 2 per 13 PEDV-infected pigs (both from the PEDV challenged groups) had to be killed due to the severity of clinical signs. This is expected and comparable with other trials infecting 3-wk-old pigs (Crawford et al., 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1349, "end": 1372, "text": "(Crawford et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 3."}, {"text": "In the current study, the PEDV IgG and IgA antibody responses were more rapid in the BovSDP group compared with the PEDV group.

Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by pairwise testing using the Tukey-Kramer adjustment if P < 0.05. The statistical software used was JMP Pro 11. IgA positive compared with 12.5% of the PEDV pigs. Of note, while systemic IgA antibodies were measured, mucosal IgA levels were not determined, and it is therefore unknown how the addition of the BovSDP affected the gut immunity. In a previous study, a good correlation of IgA levels in serum and feces was found , and as fecal samples and gut mucosa are more difficult to process during routine lab work, serum IgA levels are commonly tested. Explanations for the earlier humoral immune response in the BovSDP group may include acceleration of the clinical course by the dietary supplement; however, a more rapid immune response due to earlier replication of the virus in more pigs unrelated to the diet modification is also possible. Serum anti-PEDV Ig in pig serum has been demonstrated to neutralize infectivity of PEDV (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989) , and bovine plasma could have a similar neutralizing activity, which was not further assessed in this study. Besides the presence of possible neutralizing antibodies in SDP, other plasma compounds such as peptides (Anderson and Anderson, 2002) could contribute to the benefits seen with SDP addition to a diet.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1396, "end": 1421, "text": "(Hofmann and Wyler, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1666, "text": "(Anderson and Anderson, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 201, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Figure 3."}, {"text": "Virus shedding in the BovSDP group was 2.1 d shorter than in the PEDV group.

The addition of BovSDP to the diet resulted in faster and stronger PEDV antibody responses and reduced PEDV shedding time compared with pigs with no BovSDP in the diet.

In addition, two PEDV pigs had to be removed early from the study, which could have impacted the outcomes.
