Approximately 26% of these children are admitted to the hospital, with a median hospital length of stay of 2 to 3 days. Although the overall mortality rate is low, 3% to 5% of infants with bronchiolitis who visit the ED require mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). 1 Annually, 22,000 hospitalizations related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis are attributable to parental cigarette smoking, a costly and preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. 2 In 2006, the United States Surgeon General summarized the evidence surrounding involuntary tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) and lower respiratory infections such as bronchiolitis in young children. Across studies from diverse settings, infants exposed to parental cigarette smoking after birth are at increased risk of lower respiratory infection, 3 possibly due to inhibition of the interferon b and g-mediated response to viral infection in airway epithelium. 4, 5 In addition, in utero TSE adversely affects developing lungs, causing structural changes and limitations in air flow. 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] The surgeon general's report noted a paucity of data examining the effects of in utero and postnatal smoke exposure separately. 3 To address this information gap, we investigated the association between prenatal smoke exposure and bronchiolitis, stratified by postnatal smoke exposure, in a large multicenter prospective cohort of hospitalized children with bronchiolitis. Recently, our group found that prenatal smoke exposure was an independent predictor of severe bronchiolitis, as defined by mechanical ventilation. 10 Given this important finding and the lack of data about the health effects of prenatal in relation to postnatal smoke exposure, in this analysis, we examined the relationship between smoke exposure and bronchiolitis severity in more detail by exploring both pre-and postnatal smoke exposure and by broadening the outcome to include all ICU admissions.
