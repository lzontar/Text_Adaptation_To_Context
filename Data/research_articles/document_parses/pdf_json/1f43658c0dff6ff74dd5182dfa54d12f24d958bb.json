Policy makers must balance the positive health effects of strong distancing measures, such as lockdowns, against their economic costs, especially the burdens imposed on low income and food insecure households. The distancing measures deployed by South Africa impose large economic costs and have negative implications for the factor distribution of income. Labor with low education levels are much more strongly affected than labor with secondary or tertiary education. As a result, households with low levels of educational attainment and high dependence on labor income would experience an enormous real income shock that would clearly jeopardize the food security of these households. However, in South Africa, total incomes for low income households are significantly insulated by government transfer payments. From public health, income distribution and food security perspectives, the remarkably rapid and severe shocks imposed because of COVID-19 illustrate the value of having in place transfer policies that support vulnerable households in the event of 'black swan' type shocks.",

            "text": "The battle against the Covid-19 pandemic presents countries with difficult policy choices. Absent vaccines and pharmaceutical interventions, the only tool available to mitigate its demographic effects is some measure of physical distancing, to reduce contagion by breaking social and economic contacts. Distancing measures adopted range from purely advisory to complete lockdown of households and non-essential producers. They impose a negative shock on the economy, with immediate decline in economic activity followed by medium-term and long-term economic effects. The burden of these shocks is not borne equally across society. Policy makers must balance the positive health effects of the measures against their economic costs and the burdens imposed, particularly on low income and food insecure households. This paper examines the implications of lockdown policies for income distribution and food security, using South Africa as a case country, with a focus on the role of social protection in preserving food security. Section 2 provides a brief literature review on the role of social protection in blunting shocks. Section 3 presents the lockdown policies pursued in South Africa. Section 4 describes the methodology employed and key data. Section 5 presents results with a focus on implications for earnings and total household income. Section 6 summarizes and concludes, highlighting the important role of social protection policies as a buffer in the presence of shocks.",

Another strand of the literature focuses on the response to supply shocks, such as food shortages, famines and droughts (Sen 1986 , Gilligan and Hoddinott 2007 , Aker et al. 2011 , Asfaw et al 2017 . Some social protection programs include interventions responding to seasonal and regional supply shocks, such as the Productive Safety Net (PSN) program in Ethiopia. Others offer productive asset transfers (Rwanda, India) or multi-faceted 'graduation packages' that tackle causes of economic and social exclusion (Banerjee et al 2015) .",

Unfortunately, these public health policies have very large implications for economic activity and income, as will be shown. These shocks are sufficiently large to push many households into positions of food insecurity, especially in the absence of countervailing policies such as social protection. The lockdown can thus be characterized as a policy induced reduction in household capabilities (Sen, 1985) . 1 Increased food insecurity results principally from the severe shock to household income and the means to purchase food rather than to a supply shock such as drought.",

Hence, the 40 per cent reduction in wage earnings in the lowest two education categories implies roughly a 40 per cent reduction in their hours worked. For a household dependent on wage earnings from low educated labor, these declines are clearly sufficient to threaten food security, particularly if the household was already vulnerable. Moving up the income distribution, the impact on hours worked for tertiary educated labor is less severe, at 26 per cent, as industries that intensively use highly skilled labor can adapt to lockdown with more flexible work arrangements.",

Lower income households suffer less than those at the upper end of the distribution. Several channels influence these results. Error! Reference source not found. shows that wage earnings of lower educated suffer more than those of higher educated labor. Since low income households depend more on lower education earnings (see Table 1 ) one would expect their incomes to suffer more. The major reason this is not the case is that lower income households also receive significant exogenous transfers from the government, which are assumed to be unaltered. This transfer income makes up a larger share of the income of poor households than at the top end of the distribution.",

As a result of these transfer payments, incomes amongst low income households are, at least to some degree, protected. Continuation of these payments during the crisis is critical to maintaining food security amongst low income households. Looking more broadly at developing countries with strong lockdown measures to counter the spread of novel coronavirus but weak social protection networks, the food security outlook for low income households appears likely to be grim. Even with the social protection measures present in South Africa, the sustainability of the lockdown beyond a few weeks is open to question. In developing countries where food insecure households receive no or very limited support, low income households will very rapidly confront a choice between seeking to generate income to prevent starvation and accept the risk of becoming infected, despite any official lockdown measures. From public health, income distribution and food security perspectives, the remarkably rapid and severe shocks imposed because of COVID-19 illustrate the value of having in place transfer policies that support vulnerable households in the event of 'black swan' type shocks.",
