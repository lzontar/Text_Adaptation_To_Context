Lutz. \u00a92012 Landes Bioscience and Springer Science+Business Media. having mutated to auto-aggressive antibodies. This phenomenon occurs in diseases that do not exert an evolutionary pressure like infarction or SIRS in sepsis and trauma. For example, the acute inflammatory response as in infarction and ischemia/reperfusion involves NAbs as was first observed by Carroll's group in ischemic skeletal muscle. 1 Ischemia is accompanied by hypoxia and pH changes, which result in sudden exposure of normally hidden autoantigens. The liberated autoantigens get in contact with IgM and IgG NAbs that are present in the locally available plasma. NAbs against many of the exposed proteins exist in plasma to clear such components, when liberated in a homeostatic process. During ischemia the release of such components is, however, massive, such that the large number of liberated autoantigens get more and more in contact with NAbs upon being locally replenished during reperfusion. Immune complexes formed by these NAbs and liberated autoantigens activate complement not only by initiating the classical complement pathway, but to a significant extent by stimulating complement amplification via the alternative complement pathway, since damage to intestinal cells was only 1/3 in factor D knockouts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. 2 The phenomenon is reviewed in Chapter 13 by S.D. Fleming in this volume.",

Excessive complement activation in SIRS can induce paralysis of neutrophils, the cytokine storm of macrophages, the release of tissue factor, 4 and death by destructive processes. As long as nascent C3b deposits to immune complexes that initiate complement activation via the classical complement pathway, the number of excessively produced nascent C3b is limited. If, however, the immune complexes stimulate complement amplification, millions of nascent C3b molecules are generated, many of which bind covalently not only to opsonized pathogens, but also to nearby self components without being opsonized. This destructive process accompanied by proinflammatory cytokines will eventually result in binding, entrapment and phagocytosis of self structures and thereby exerts a devastating role in an organism. Until recently it has remained unclear how immune complexes stimulate excessive complement activation via the alternative complement pathway, but the phenomenon as such is known for 30 to 40 years. 5 The mechanism will be reviewed in this chapter.",

            "text": "Complement amplification is normally stimulated by C3b newly generated by one of the three complement pathways. A newly generated C3b molecule nucleates an alternative C3 convertase (C3bBb) that is stabilized by properdin (C3bBbP) and catalyzes the cleavage of additional C3 molecules to C3a and C3b. This process is eventually limited by factor H and I, which together will inactivate C3b to iC3b. This control is overrun if the number of generated C3b molecules is ten to hundred times higher, implying that the precursor of such superactive C3 convertases must be far more stable than monovalently bound C3b and that the generated precursor or enzyme has to be far more effective than a C3bBb complex. One such effective C3 convertase precursor is formed on IgG immune complexes (IgG-IC) that captured dimeric C3b by one of the heavy chains. Dimeric C3b deposits to immune complexed IgG antibodies that have an affinity for C3 outside the antigen-binding sites. 6 An immune complexed IgG NAb having this affinity for C3 preferentially forms C3b 2 -IgG complexes 7 and these complexes are far more effective C3 converase precursors than C3b. The reason for their high efficiency is that the dimeric C3b within this complex has a longer half life than C3b 7 and the dimeric C3b provides an increased affinity for properdin that exists in oligomeric form in plasma. As a consequence a C3b 2 -IgG containing immune complex first binds oligomeric properdin which in its bound state greatly increases the affinity for factor B (Fig. 1 ). 8 The prolonged half life of C3b 2 -IgG complexes and the stimulation by an increased affinity for factor B, render such complexes about 750 times more effective in generating C3 convertases than monovalently bound C3b. Such IgG molecules that stimulate complement amplification appear to be rare, but have not been searched for systematically. They appear to recruit primarily from IgG NAbs 9,10 and remain active in Mg 2+ EGTA-treated human serum. 11 While Valim and Lachmann suggested that the IgG2 subclass predominantly activated the alternative complement pathway, 12 Banda et al. claim that IgG molecules capable of initiating the murine alternative complement pathway require N-glycans bound to Asp227 within the Fc portion of the heavy chains. 13 In none of the two cases it has been investigated how complement amplification is stimulated and whether this stimulation was in any way related to the formation of C3b-containing IgG-IC. In contrast to this, generation of C3b 2 -IgG complexes in the course of an alternative complement pathway stimulation is known for 30 years. In fact, Gadd and Reid were the first to notice that IgG-IC that stimulate complement amplification, capture C3b molecules by one of their heavy chains. 11 While their finding suggested the presence of either monomeric or dimeric C3b on one heavy chain, we could demonstrate by 2-dimensional SDS PAGE with a hydroxylamine treatment between the dimensions that C3b-carrying IgG-IC contain exclusively ester-bonded dimeric C3b on one heavy chain, but are contaminated by free C3b dimers (Fig. 2 ). 14 These findings are in favor of the mechanism that we have suggested for the stimulation of complement amplification by IgG-IC. Long known additional findings support the mechanism further, namely that not only IgG-IC, but also F(ab') 2 -IC stimulate complement amplification at least to the same extent [9] [10] [11] 15 with up to 56% of C3 being activated in 100% plasma, 16 by generating C3b 2 -F(ab') 2 -IC. 11, 15 These findings demonstrate that the ability of IgG-IC to stimulate complement amplification differed from their ability to activate the classical pathway, because stimulation of complement amplification did not require the Fc portion. The ability of almost any type of F(ab') 2 -IC to stimulate complement amplification appeared obvious, because the lack of the Fc portion may have increased the accessibility for nascent C3b to deposit to the CH1 domain of F(ab') 2 -IC complexes.",

In our attempt to search for this serum factor we hypothesized that \"IgG anti-hinge NAbs\" that had been studied more recently in quite some details by the group of Terness (for reviews see refs. 20, 21), may represent this serum factor. Anti-hinge NAbs have even earlier been studied and named \"pepsin agglutinators,\" because they agglutinated IgG upon its treatment with pepsin that generates F(ab') 2 and Fc. 22, 23 IgG anti-hinge antibodies are germline-encoded NAbs that bind to a conformational hinge region epitope that becomes accessible exclusively upon cleavage of IgG1 by pepsin. 24 Anti-hinge NAbs have an important role in the regulation of the B-cell antibody production. Their plasma concentration increases slightly when B cells start producing antibodies and eventually anti-hinge NAbs stop B-cell antibody production by binding to the hinge region of antigen-carrying B-cell receptor and Fc receptor of the antibody-producing B cell. 21 Thus, anti-hinge NAbs have an important regulatory function within the innate and adaptive immune system.",

Since these NAbs lack a CH1-mediated affinity for C3, they stimulate complement amplification as F(ab') 2 -IC, but not as IgG-IC in normal human serum. Absorption of normal serum on immobilized F(ab') 2 removed anti-hinge NAbs and abrogated the ability of F(ab') 2 -IC to stimulate complement amplification, while supplementation with purified anti-hinge NAbs restored stimulation of complement amplification. 25 Thus, anti-hinge NAbs represent the serum factor that is required to rigidify F(ab') 2 -IC such that nascent C3b can deposit as a dimer to one Fab portion of F(ab') 2 -IC. This finding may further explain why the efficacy by which F(ab') 2 -IC stimulate complement amplification is high with human serum, but decreases with serum from more primitive species that are known to have lower concentrations of anti-hinge NAbs. 26",

Nine patients in intensive care with several types of bacterial infection, elevated CRP values and neutrophil numbers have been studied for elastase, generation of F(ab') 2 fragments, factor Bb concentration, and formation of secondary immune complexes comprised of F(ab') 2 -IC and anti-hinge NAbs. Both the concentration of F(ab') 2 and that of the activated complement factor B (Bb) increased linearly with the total concentration of elastase in plasma (Fig. 4) . 25 These results provide suggestive evidence for the role of elastase in generating F(ab') 2 from IgG and the ability of secondary IC to act as potent precursors of alternative C3 convertases. Gelfiltrations on plasma proteins from these patients revealed that the total concentration of F(ab') 2 was about three g/ml plasma, but less than 10% of this material migrated with its MW of about 100 kDa. 3 The majority of F(ab') 2 (1.7 +/ 0.4 g/ml, n = 9) was recovered in pool A with MWs in the range from 200 to 800 kDa and 0.4+/ 0.1 g/ml migrated in pool B with MWs of about 150 kDa. In contrast to this, none of the pools from controls contained measurable concentrations of F(ab') 2 . Hence, these results do not only confirm the formation of F(ab') 2 during severe sepsis, but illustrate the formation of secondary immune complexes, of which the largest one (pool A) contained aside of 1.7 g/ml F(ab') 2 , unknown antigens, and 0.9 g/ml anti-hinge NAbs. 25 At first it appears that a total concentration of F(ab') 2 of 3 g/ml is minute, but if all the F(ab') 2 -IC in pool A formed pairwise secondary immune complexes, of which all captured dimeric C3b and each of them allowed assembly of C3 convertases, these convertases would have generated theoretically 600 g/ml C3b. This estimate would mean activation of 50% of C3, a huge portion, but not unrealistic for immune complexes that stimulate complement amplification.",

The latter goal is reached by injecting a sufficient amount of irrelevant F(ab') 2 fragments that bind to anti-hinge NAbs and thereby prevent them from rigidifying F(ab') 2 -IC. This approach has been taken by Dr. Dietrich 45 years ago in form of Gamma Venin, a F(ab') 2 preparation from pooled whole human IgG. 32 It turned out to be quite effective in nine patients with severe sepsis. His explanation of why the treatment was effective, was, however, inappropriate on the basis of what was known. He argued that the many types of F(ab') 2 helped clearing pathogens, although efficient clearance normally requires immune complex formation by IgG antibodies and their recognition by phagocytic receptors via the Fc portion of these antibody molecules. Therefore the immunologists may have concluded that IgG should have been used instead of F(ab') 2 and they convinced the companies to isolate and pool human IgG for intravenous application (IVIG).",

This type of cooperation of anti-hinge NAbs with F(ab') 2 is, however, highly dependent on the relative concentrations of total F(ab') 2 , antigen-specific F(ab') 2 and anti-hinge NAbs. For example, anti-hinge NAbs that existed in varying concentrations in nonhuman primates induced a rapid clearance of about 75% of platelets purposely tagged with a monoclonal anti-platelet F(ab') 2 in 5 of 30 animals. 26 On the other hand, an injection of F(ab') 2 from pooled human IgG in amounts that can complex all available anti-hinge NAbs, as performed by Dietrich, must have prevented anti-hinge NAbs from binding to newly generated F(ab') 2 -IC and thereby exerted a beneficial effect in patients with a severe sepsis.",

In general they referred to the reduced degradation of elastin and matrix proteins resulting in reduced lung injury 38 and its inhibiting effect on NF-kappaB. 43 Thus, there is ample room for clinical trials in which effective drugs like sivelestat are applied and the patients studied for IgG cleavage and the parameters of complement amplification.",

In case these F(ab') 2 fragments form immune complexes (IC) with autoantigens the F(ab') 2 -IC have a high probability to form secondary IC with anti-hinge NAbs. Binding of anti-hinge NAbs to F(ab') 2 -IC rigidifies these complexes and thereby enables them to capture C3b dimers. Bound C3b dimers are precursors of alternative C3 convertases, being about 750 times more effective than bound C3b. The extent to which the generated C3 convertases stimulate excessive complement activation via the amplification loop is difficult to predict. Excessive complement activation is dependent on the concentration of anti-hinge NAb-stabilized F(ab') 2 -IC and thus is a function of antigen-specific F(ab') 2 , the concentration of immune complexes, and that of anti-hinge NAbs. The process is inhibitable by irrelevant F(ab') 2 fragments that bind to anti-hinge NAbs and prevent it from stabilizing F(ab') 2 -IC.
