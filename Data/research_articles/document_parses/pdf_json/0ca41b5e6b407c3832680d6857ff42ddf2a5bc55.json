In the field of gynecologic oncology, we have to re-design our treatments' paradigm. During COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the highest priority is to achieve the maximum benefit from less demanding procedures. Extensive procedures should be avoided, in order to reduce hospitalization and postoperative events that might increase the in-hospital spread of the virus. There are ongoing concerns on the use of laparoscopic procedures, related to the possible contamination of the staff working in the operation room. Other minimally invasive techniques, including, vaginal surgery as well as robotic-assisted and isobaric procedures would be preferred over laparoscopy. A fair allocation of resources is paramount adequate treatments.",

The treatment modality of ovarian cancer is directly related to the stage of presentation and patients' characteristics. In the early stage of disease, surgery is mandatory even in the era of COVID-19 outbreak. Surgery (with or without chemotherapy) allow tumor removal, staging and guarantees a high possibility of long-term cure for those patients [5] . In patients with apparent early-stage ovarian cancer, the choice to have lymphadenectomy should be tailored on patients' and diseases' characteristics. When possible, it should be avoided. In particular, lymphadenectomy should be avoided in mucinous tumors while, in other histologic type (e.g., serous histology) at high risk of nodal spread lymphadenectomy could be executed [6] . In fact, no clear data support the beneficial effects of full lymphadenectomy in those patients, especially if adjuvant chemotherapy is planned [6] .",

            "text": "In advanced stage of disease (International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecologists [FIGO] stage IIIB-IV) surgery followed adjuvant chemotherapy (generally 6 cycles) is considered the standard of care [5] . In women presenting with suspected advanced stage ovarian cancer, surgery allows to i) make a precise histological diagnosis, ii) evaluate the burden of disease, identifying the real diffusion of the tumor into the peritoneal cavity, and iii) more important to remove all macroscopic lesions. In fact, residual disease is one of the most important prognostic factors in patients with ovarian cancer. Although primary cytoreductive surgery should be the preferred treatment modality in women with advanced disease growing evidence support that the execution of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is a valuable alternative to primary cytoreductive surgery. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery seems reducing surgery-related morbidity (since the reduction of complexity of surgery) and to be related to similar long-term outcomes than primary cytoreductive surgery. Two randomized controlled trials (EORTC5597 and the CHORUS study) suggested the non-inferiority and reduced invasiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery in comparison to open surgery in patients affected by advanced disease [7] . To date, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery is not fully accepted [8] . The gynecologic oncology community have concerns related to the low number of patients having complete (no residual disease) and optimal (residual disease <1 cm) cytoreduction included in the primary debulking arms. The ongoing TRUST study will clarify the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced stage ovarian cancer [9] . Until now, in light of the evidence provided, the use of primary cytoreductive surgery should be avoided in patients for whom extensive cytoreductive procedure are anticipated. Patients with a high burden of disease should be counseled to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy in order to reduce treatment related morbidity and to possibly allow the execution of surgery (generally after 3 months) after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. By this point of view patients diagnosed with a high burden of disease (those with FIGO stages IIIC and IVB) could be considered to have neoadjuvant chemotherapy after having acquired histological diagnosis by laparoscopic examination or radiological-guided biopsy. Histological assessment is mandatory before starting chemotherapy. The decision to have primary cytoreductive surgery in stage IIIC ovarian cancer with a high burden of disease patients should be carefully discussed and have to be reserved in a selected group of patients.",

The hazard ratio for disease progression or death (surgery vs. no surgery) was 0.82 (95% confidence interval=0.66-1.01). The present investigation highlighted that about one out of ten patients is at risk of developing postoperative complications [14] . Additionally, patient-reported quality of life decreased significantly after surgery; albeit it did not differ significantly between the two groups after recovery [14] . Therefore, on the light of the available evidence supporting the use of chemotherapy only in recurrent ovarian cancer patients, the secondary surgery would be reserved only in super-selected patients.

Retrospective data suggested that the execution of sentinel node mapping provide similar oncologic results in comparison to full lymphadenectomy [22, 23] . Additionally, sentinel node mapping seems to improve the identification of patients with nodal involvement (FIGO stage IIIC disease) thanks to the detection of low volume disease (micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells detectable by ultrastaging). Data of centers implementing sentinel node mapping highlighted that sentinel node mapping is a simple and not time-consuming procedures, furthermore it does not increase significantly complication rate in comparison to hysterectomy alone.",

Surgery and radiotherapy showed equivalent oncologic safety in patients affected by early-stage cervical cancer. However, radiotherapy correlates with long-term sequelea, and should be avoided in young patients. Therefore, surgery represent the mainstay of treatment for cervical cancer patients in the early-stage of disease, being associated with favorable oncologic outcomes [25] . Open abdominal radical hysterectomy represents the standard of care. Surgery should be performed via Pfannstiel or Kusner incisions in order to improve postoperative recovery, shorter hospitalization and a rapid workflow. In last decades, minimally-invasive surgery has replaced open surgery for the treatment of several malignant conditions, including cervical cancer [26] . Accumulating data from retrospective studies suggested that minimally invasive approach upholds oncologic results, improving short-term postoperative course in comparison to conventional open surgery [27, 28] . Recently, the unexpected results of the Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer (LACC) trial have brought a strong debate into the gynecologic oncology community [29] . The LACC trial randomized patients to have minimally invasive and open abdominal radical hysterectomy, suggesting that patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery experience an increased risk of developing local recurrences and worse overall survival than patients undergoing open surgery [29] . Nodal evaluation is crucial in cervical cancer patients. As aforementioned for retroperitoneal staging of endometrial cancer, sentinel node mapping would replace the execution of full (pelvic) lymphadenectomy, thus minimizing possible complications and improving postoperative course [21] . Although surgery is the preferred treatments modality in early stage cervical cancer patients we have to point out that surgery could be avoided in 2 particular class of patients affected by early stage cervical cancer. First, in a setting lacking of adequate resources, we have to take in consideration the execution of definitive radiotherapy in elderly (aged 70 years of age or older) patients affected by early-stage cervical cancer. Second, patients affected by early stage cervical cancer but with tumor larger more than 2 cm and with sign of the interruption of stromal ring (detected at 7/16 https://ejgo.org https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2020.31.e72",

However, the adoption of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery is not still accepted. In fact, no level A evidence support the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy instead of radiation [31] . Radio chemotherapy remains the standard of care for those patients. Therefore, the execution of neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided. Chemotherapy (including cisplatinum/carboplatinum and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab) still remains the standard of care in case of metastatic disease. The role of salvage surgery (i.e., pelvic exenteration) in case of metastatic and recurrent disease has to be taken into consideration only in a group of very selected patients. Additionally, chemotherapy should be considered a valuable option for patients with recurrent cervical cancer according to the results of the GOG 240 trial.

Additionally, it is important to underline that about 5% of women having prophylactic surgery are diagnosed with occult cancer, detected by pathological examination only [35] . Although these procedures have a minimal impact on patients' status due to the low risk of developing morbidity and the rapid workflow of patients, the routine use of risk reduction surgery is not recommended during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.

In case of diagnosis of severe VIN and VaIN, outpatient surgical treatment could be safely performed. In case of large lesions deserving wide excision, medical treatments including the use of 5-FU or other local antiblastic agents would be a safe option [36] . In case of diagnosis of severe cervical dysplasia, cervical conization is recommended. The treatment of these lesions is simple and not require hospitalization. They can be safely performed in an out-patient setting, thus minimizing possible in hospital diffusion of COVID-19. Additionally, we have to point out that in absence of macroscopic lesions, conization could be safely delayed (<3 months) [36] . Histological examination should be achieved also in case of ablative procedures in order to identify possible malignant conditions. Similarly, patients having suspected endometrial lesions (i.e., patients having uterine bleeding) deserve to be evaluated in order to identify possible malignant and pre-neoplastic lesions. Endometrial sampling should be achieved in out-patients setting using hysteroscopic examination or other simplest endometrial sample techniques. Histological examinations should be reserve to patients presenting with symptoms; while in absence of uterine bleeding histological examination is not mandatory, regardless the endometrial thickness [37] .",

There are not data supporting routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients; therefore, we suggest to postponing follow up visits in asymptomatic women. Additionally, telemedicine would be useful in case of patients requiring second opinion in specialized cancer centers. Today, there are telemedicine solutions that allow patients to seek a 2nd opinion from their home. Sending another physician copy of their medical images and more can easily be done by uploading the content to their secure website.

To date there is not consensus regarding the best way of triage methods of those patients. Microbiological test plus computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax in the last 24 hours would be the preferred methods for triaging patients. However, these methods do not guarantee a detection rate of COVID-19 infection in all patients. Interestingly, about 80% of patients infected by COVID-19 are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. There are concerns on the adoption of laparoscopy in potentially infected patients. The Royal College of Surgeons warns against the use of laparoscopic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic outbreak [38] . Since surgical smoke and intra-operative aerosol (normally occurring during minimally invasive procedures) might promote the diffusion of COVID-19 in the operative room (OR), thus infecting surgeons and operative staff. Personal protective equipment (PPE) are necessary to all staff working into the operative theater. The minimum necessary number of individuals should allow to enter in the theater. Levels of pneumoperitoneum pressure and the power settings of electrocautery should be as low as possible in order to reduce possible aerosol formation [39] . In patients having ongoing COVID-19 surgery should avoided (when possible); while in a COVID-19-free setting the use of minimally invasive surgery would be the preferred surgical approach. Minimally invasive surgery guarantees a rapid patients' workflow, reducing hospitalization and the occurrence of postoperative complications in comparison to traditional open surgery. However, laparoscopic approach should be performed only if the protection of the staff working in the OR is guaranteed [39] . To date, the risk of contamination during laparoscopy is only theoretical and it has not been proven yet. However, until new evidence would be available, surgeons and the other health care providers working in the OR should use PPE, including respiratory masks (e.g., N95, FPP2, FFP3) and medical eye protection. The use of trocar port filters (ultra-filtration systems) is highly recommended, but no evidence is still support they clinical utility [40] . Surgeons have to choose the best surgical approach that guarantee safety for patients and for the OR staff.",

During COVID-19 outbreak we have to maximize the overall cure rate, reducing patients' hospitalization and postoperative events. Generally, less invasive procedures should be preferred in order to improve post-surgical recovery. Extensive surgical procedures for which the admission of intensive care unit would be necessary should be taken in consideration only in selected cases, while unfit and elderly patients should receive the possible less invasive procedures. Maximizing benefit requires consideration of patients' and disease characteristics as well as prognosis. Patients' characteristics that have to be considered should include mere chronological age as well as functional age, performance status, and a careful evaluation of comorbidity. Diseases' characteristics that have to be considered should include natural history of the disease, the burden of disease, and the possible risk of growing/spread. Additionally, we have to take in consideration the impact of hospitalization and treatment related morbidity on the outcomes of possibly compromised patients. We can speculate that surgery has an impact on asymptomatic patients harboring indolent COVID-19 infection. Abdominal surgical procedures (especially if they are performed via open approach) per se, are associated with a high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications [26, 27] . Data from China highlighted that 80% of those infected either are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Anecdotally, in our surgical practice we are assisting an increasing number of asymptomatic patients, without sign of infection at preoperative CT of the thorax who develop postoperative interstitial pneumonia after surgery. We can speculate that advanced abdominal procedures, impacting on the efficacy of the immune systems, increase the risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome and interstitial pneumonia in patients harboring an asymptomatic COVID-19. On the light of the risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome and interstitial pneumonia, the need of surgery and possible alternatives have to be explored. A multidisciplinary evaluation of oncologic patients is mandatory in order to explore possible therapeutic options. Surgery has to avoided in patients in elderly and obese patients with poor general conditions. Minimally invasive surgery (especially using isobaric technique) has to be carried out instead of the performing open approach, in order to reduce morbidity and length of stay.",
