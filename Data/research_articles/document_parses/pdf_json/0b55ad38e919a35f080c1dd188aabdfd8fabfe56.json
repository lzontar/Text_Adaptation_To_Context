Identifying and quantifying the heterogeneity, using the appropriate analysis based on the heterogeneity as fixed or random models of analysis, prediction intervals, subgroups analyses, and meta-regression are required [3] to better and precise estimation for the effect size in the meta-analysis that will be one of the primary factors for COVID-19 evidence-based practice.",

The Hu and colleges have conducted the analysis with the last search strategy on 10 March 2020 and submitted the work for publication on 11 March 2020. The journal has accepted the manuscript on 11 April 2020, then the work is available on the website and databases on 14 April 2020. In the PubMed database, and using the same search terms and MeSH terms in Young Hu analysis, there are 126 citations, the number of them is eligible to be included. Reporting of the last search is very important. Rapid peer review processing is required to keep the value of published meta-analysis.",
