            "text": "Dear Editor, Older adults at home, intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) setting including nursing home and hospice care are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection with increased morbidity and mortality. Singapore is one of the fastest aging countries in Asia where 14.4% of population is above 65 years old and this will double by 2030 (1). About 16000 older adults live in long-term care facilities and many more attend different types of day care facilities (2) . Many of the residents are frail, with underlying dementia and / or multimorbidity and often present atypically causing a delay in diagnosis. In many countries, COVID-19 has spread amongst nursing home residents with mortality ranging from 24% in Hungary to 82% in Canada (3). It is known that 56% of residents may test positive while in presymptomatic stage, and many countries have put in initiatives to decrease the risk of spread in care homes (4) . COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration amongst ILTC providers which in many countries are run by non-governmental organization's, healthcare providers, regional and national healthcare leaders.",

Each of the clusters are responsible for the population health of the selected region, bringing together care, and enhancing capabilities of primary care and community service providers, and to anchor care in the community as a team. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), a centralized agency under the Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for the overall development of community care and/or ILTC services and works closely with the different RHS to maintain standards and quality of ILTC sectors (5) . During COVID-19 pandemic, AIC has been working closely with MOH, RHS and community care providers in strengthening the pre-existing network to implement measures to slow the spread of the disease, and maintain the physical and mental wellbeing of older adults and caregivers. AIC serves as a command centre to guide and provide support for the various ILTC's including provision of information and resources.",

Special attention is also being given to additional funding requirement arising from COVID-19 prevention measures, staff appreciation and setting up telehealth and / or televisit infrastructure. A COVID-19 incident response team advising on heightened precautionary measures, surveillance testing, crisis communication and ensuring business continuity has been set up by AIC to support service providers with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The containment of small numbers of outbreaks has been made possible by above measures which also includes education, information sharing and learning from different ILTC providers on success measures.",
