We previously identified proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) as a crucial host determinant of ILTV infection. The present study revealed accelerated spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. This phenomenon was independent of either viral replication or the proliferation of infected cells and could not be compromised by neutralizing antibody. Neither extracellular vesicles nor the direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections between adjacent cells contributed to the enhanced spread of ILTV upon Src inhibition. Further genome-wide transcriptional profile analyses in combination with functional validation identified fatty acid metabolism as an essential molecular event during modulation of the intercellular spread and subsequent cytopathic effect of ILTV by Src. Overall, these data suggest that Src controls the cell-to-cell spread of ILTV in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner, which determines the virus's cytopathic effect.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The spread of infectious viruses between host cells is important for viral replication, virulence, and pathogenesis (Flint et al., 2009) . Two routes exist for viral spread: cell-free spread, which involves infection of new cells through extracellular virions or vesicles containing infectious materials released by infected cells, and cell-to-cell spread, which involves viral particle transmission between cells via cell-to-cell contacts or direct connections (Mothes et al., 2010; Sattentau, 2008) . Cell-free spread is well established and important for distant viral dissemination, such as transmission between hosts and tissue-to-tissue spread within the host body through blood, lymph and cerebrospinal fluid. During distant spread, viruses must be released from host cells. However, once released into the extracellular environment, viruses are exposed to several barriers that block their subsequent cell-free spread, including biophysical barriers such as mucous membranes, cell intrinsic barriers associated with host immunosurveillance, and kinetic barriers due to the processes of random fluid-phase diffusion, attachment of a virus to the host cell membrane and the penetration of viruses bound to host cells. To achieve success in distant dissemination, all of these barriers must be overcome by viruses. Considering these disadvantages of cellfree spread, many viruses have evolved to exploit cell-to-cell spread as an alternative strategy to overcome the above barriers. Cell-to-cell spread has been proven to be important for infection with many clinically important viruses, such as herpesviruses, poxviruses, measles virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and rabies virus (Christian et al., 1971; Ritzenthaler, 2011; Sattentau, 2008 Sattentau, , 2011 Wheeler, 1960) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 136, "text": "(Flint et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 462, "end": 483, "text": "(Mothes et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 484, "end": 500, "text": "Sattentau, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1717, "end": 1741, "text": "(Christian et al., 1971;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1742, "end": 1761, "text": "Ritzenthaler, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1777, "text": "Sattentau, 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1795, "text": "Sattentau, , 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1810, "text": "Wheeler, 1960)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "For alphaherpesviruses, the main route of spread in tissues is cell-tocell spread during primary infections in mucocutaneous tissue, establishment of latent infection in sensory neurons, and reactivation from latency, during which the virus spreads intercellularly between the mucocutaneous tissue and sensory neurons (Abaitua et al., 2013; Arvin et al., 2007) .

Similar to other alphaherpesviruses, ILTV establishes latency in the nervous system after acute infection of the upper respiratory tract and cannot be cleared from the host by any currently available therapeutic treatment; therefore, reactivation of ILTV from latent infection frequently occurs once the host is under stress or host immunity is compromised (Hughes et al., 1989 (Hughes et al., , 1991 Ou and Giambrone, 2012) . Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for cell-to-cell spread can facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies to control virus reactivation and the design of effective vaccines to combat ILTV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 318, "end": 340, "text": "(Abaitua et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 341, "end": 360, "text": "Arvin et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 681, "end": 705, "text": "(Criscuolo et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 893, "end": 917, "text": "(Ou and Giambrone, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 963, "end": 983, "text": "(Coppo et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1363, "text": "(Hughes et al., 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1364, "end": 1386, "text": "(Hughes et al., , 1991", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1410, "text": "Ou and Giambrone, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) was originally isolated from a chicken sarcoma and was thought to contribute to oncogenesis (Vogt, 1971) . Src has been shown to be an important factor for a wide range of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, adhesion, division, and death, angiogenesis, and organization of the cytoskeleton. Src has also been reported to be involved in infections with a wide range of viruses, including polyoma virus, dengue, HIV-1, coronaviruses, influenza virus, and herpesvirus (Bolen et al., 1984; Burkard et al., 2015; Cheshenko et al., 2005; Gaur et al., 2012; Krishnan et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2016; McCarthy et al., 2016) , suggesting that Src may be a new potential target for antiviral therapeutic agents and may have potential for repurposing existing FDA-approved Src inhibitors. However, no clinical applications of antiviral Src-targeting agents have been reported, which may be at least partially due to the complicated roles of Src in its regulation of the multiple biological processes in which it is involved. The biological effects of Src are complex and sometimes controversial. For example, some studies suggest that Src is essential in PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (Barone and Courtneidge, 1995; Twamley-Stein et al., 1993) ; however, other studies of PDGF-induced DNA synthesis indicate that Src is not absolutely required and even plays the opposite role (DeMali and Kazlauskas, 1998; Rosenkranz et al., 2000) . In addition, Src is considered both a survival factor and a death factor depending on specific cellular conditions (Fan et al., 2007 (Fan et al., , 2013 (Fan et al., , 2014 Iqbal Hossain et al., 2015) . Our previous study identified Src as the key host determinant of ILTV infection (Li et al., 2015) . We found that activation of host Src upon ILTV infection raises the threshold of host cells for ILTV infection-induced cell death, thus maintaining the survival of infected cells and ensuring a high level of viral replication. However, therapies targeting Src not only repress viral replication but also exacerbate the pathological effects of ILTV and even increase the likelihood of death of the host. Because the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been sufficiently investigated, the development of Src-based therapeutics is limited. Viral replication requires host cellular metabolism. While similarities exist, virus-specific metabolic requirements by different viruses have been identified. Many viruses have been shown to induce fatty acid synthesis in host cells, which provides a stable carbon source and sufficient energy for viral replication, viral spread and even the prolonged survival of infected cells (Rodr\u00edguez-S\u00e1nchez and Munger, 2019; Sanchez and Lagunoff, 2015; Sanchez et al., 2017) . Although the mechanism remains unclear for ILTV, the utilization of host fatty acid metabolism has been found to be important for both latent and lytic infections with human gamma herpesvirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), and the survival of infected cells (Delgado et al., 2012; Sanchez et al., 2017) . Thus, a better understanding of the involvement of fatty acid metabolism in viral infection may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting specific cellular metabolic processes. In the present study, we observed accelerated cellto-cell spread of ILTV with Src inhibition in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner, which determines the cytopathic effect (CPE) of ILTV. Given the importance of cell-to-cell spread during ILTV infection as evidenced by the efficient protection against ILTV infection provided to a host by cell-mediated immunity rather than humoural immunity (Coppo et al., 2013) , the mechanism that we revealed may be valuable for the future development of more rational anti-ILTV vaccination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 141, "end": 153, "text": "(Vogt, 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 528, "end": 548, "text": "(Bolen et al., 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 549, "end": 570, "text": "Burkard et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 571, "end": 594, "text": "Cheshenko et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 595, "end": 613, "text": "Gaur et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 614, "end": 636, "text": "Krishnan et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 637, "end": 656, "text": "Kumar et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 657, "end": 679, "text": "McCarthy et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1265, "text": "(Barone and Courtneidge, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1293, "text": "Twamley-Stein et al., 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1427, "end": 1456, "text": "(DeMali and Kazlauskas, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1481, "text": "Rosenkranz et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1616, "text": "(Fan et al., 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1636, "text": "(Fan et al., , 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1656, "text": "(Fan et al., , 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1684, "text": "Iqbal Hossain et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1767, "end": 1784, "text": "(Li et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2710, "end": 2746, "text": "(Rodr\u00edguez-S\u00e1nchez and Munger, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2747, "end": 2774, "text": "Sanchez and Lagunoff, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2775, "end": 2796, "text": "Sanchez et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 3075, "end": 3097, "text": "(Delgado et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3098, "end": 3119, "text": "Sanchez et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 3729, "end": 3749, "text": "(Coppo et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The virulent ILTV-LJS09 strain (GenBank Accession No. JX458822) is stored at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of CAAS.

As shown by time-lapse microscopy, EGFP signals appeared between 3 and 6 hpi in all ILTV-infected groups.

To address this hypothesis, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against ILTV glycoprotein I produced in our lab (Li et al., 2015) was utilized as a neutralizing antibody to block virions released into culture medium by infected cells.

Currently, no antiviral drug targeting the latent infection of alphaherpesvirus is available, which can lead to outbreaks when the host is under stress or the host's immune system is compromised. During both the establishment of latent infection in sensory neurons and reactivation from latency, the virus spreads intercellularly between the mucocutaneous tissue and sensory neurons (Arvin et al., 2007; Abaitua et al., 2013) . Thus, elucidation of the underlying mechanisms modulating the cell-to-cell spread of alphaherpesviruses may provide promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and for refining the rational design of effective vaccines to combat alphaherpesviruses.

The simplest and most widely used model of cell-to-cell spread is plaque formation in cell cultures with or without the addition of a neutralizing antibody, which reflects the cumulative processes of the host-virus interaction, including viral binding, penetration and replication, reorganization of cell-to-cell junctions, viral intercellular transport, and restriction mechanisms used by the host to resist infection, such as antiviral immune responses and factors (Dingwell et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 2001; Mettenleiter et al., 2009 ). Such models have been frequently used to investigate the processes of cell-to-cell spread and the essential viral and host factors for these processes (Farnsworth and Johnson, 2006; Krummenacher et al., 2003; Sourvinos and Everett, 2002) . Recent studies utilizing advanced techniques and equipment to visualize viral infections in living cells, such as time-lapse microscopy, have revealed some novel features of viral cell-to-cell spread that had previously been unexpected and unrecognized. For instance, many viruses have been observed to spread Z. Wang, et al. Virology 537 (2019) 1-13 faster than the limits imposed by their replication kinetics. For poxviruses, through the repulsion of superinfecting virions by infected cells mediated by viral proteins A33, A36, A56, K2, and B5, the speed of viral spread is four-times faster than that expected according to their replication kinetics (Doceul et al., 2010 (Doceul et al., , 2012 . Rapid viral cell-to-cell spread has also been observed for HIV and herpesviruses, and paracrine-dependent migration of uninfected cells to the site of infection (Abaitua et al., 2013; Igakura et al., 2003; Jolly and Sattentau, 2004) as well as intercellular spread via nanotubes (Eugenin et al., 2009) were thought to contribute to this phenomenon. Cytoplasmic connections can promote the spread of viruses such as HIV-1 and herpesviruses by transporting viral genomes, viral capsids or vesicles containing viral particles between adjacent cells (Digel et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2014; Lucas, 2006) . The present study suggests that despite being enhanced by ILTV infection, direct cytosol-to-cytosol connections do not contribute to the promoted intercellular spread of ILTV by Src inhibition Z. Wang, et al. Virology 537 (2019) 1-13 ( Fig. 4) . In addition, herpesviruses can travel from infected cells to neighbouring cells via budding at the basolateral intercellular junction or by crossing the tight junctions between cells (Cocchi et al., 2000; Dingwell et al., 1994; York and Johnson, 1993) .

On one hand, Src activation raises the threshold of infected host cells for infection-induced host cell death, which prolongs the duration of ILTV replication in each infected cell and allows the infiltrated virus to achieve optimal replication. Meanwhile, along with Src activation, ILTV infection also tends to accelerate viral cell-to-cell spread. Unexpectedly, according to the findings of the present study, this process is restricted by the activation of host Src triggered by the ILTV infection itself. In sum, Src activation by ILTV not only ensures the ultimate replication of viruses in infected cells but also limits viral dissemination. Why does ILTV activate host Src to achieve these opposite functions? As we showed in previous Z. Wang, et al. Virology 537 (2019) 1-13 studies, Src inhibition not only represses ILTV replication but also reduces the threshold of infected cells for ILTV-triggered cell death and pathologic damage (Li et al., 2015) . Considering the rapid establishment of latent infection during the initial infection with ILTV, the opposite effects of Src activation by ILTV infection most likely reflect a strategy that evolves during the co-evolution of ILTV and its host, which establishes a balance for the pathogen-host interaction. Host metabolic requirements for maximal viral production have been examined in several human herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and KSHV (Delgado et al., 2012; Munger et al., 2006 Munger et al., , 2008 Sanchez et al., 2017; Vastag et al., 2011) , and the results suggest that inhibition of specific cellular metabolic pathways can both eliminate latently infected cells and block lytic replication, thus providing opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for herpesviruses. Although similarities exist, significant differences in the utilization of host metabolic resources by these herpesviruses have been reported. For example, HCMV increased the levels of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites fuelling fatty acid synthesis, while HSV-1 increased the level of flux to the TCA cycle to drive pyrimidine synthesis. The metabolic Z. Wang, et al. Virology 537 (2019) 1-13 signature of ILTV has not yet been addressed. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that Src inhibition promotes intercellular ILTV spread in a host cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner (Fig. 7) . Src is a myristoylated protein and can be found both within and outside of lipid rafts, as well as within endosomes, before translocating to the plasma membrane (Seong et al., 2009) . Src can be activated by exogenous saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate and myristic acid, or the overexpression of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36, also named fatty acid translocase), which is known to facilitate long-chain fatty acid uptake through the myristoylation of Src, leading to activation of its downstream signalling, such as JNK signalling (Holzer et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017 Kim et al., , 2019 Park et al., 2016) . Nonetheless, given the increased fatty acid oxidation observed in mice with knockout of Fyn, another Src kinase family member (Bastie et al., 2007) , Src activation by ILTV infection may limit viral intercellular spread by balancing host fatty acid metabolism, which can be negated by Src inhibition, resulting in accelerated viral spread and an exacerbated CPE of infection as observed in our model. This hypothesis is partially supported by our findings that inhibition of Src rescues the reduced transcription of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 6 , Table  S2 ), and that the promoting effects of Src inhibition on both intercellular viral spread and the cytopathogenicity of ILTV can be significantly attenuated by modulation of host fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 7) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 845, "end": 882, "text": "Wang, et al.

The generation of LMH cell line and chicken embryo with Src knockout background using CRISPR/Cas9 system will be greatly helpful to further investigations of Src-mediated mechanisms in ILTV infection by excluding any cell type or chemical specific effect. Considering the heterogeneous environment and the difficulty associated with controlling and monitoring the cell-to-cell spread of ILTV in vivo, in vitro studies were carried out to investigate the effect of Src on ILTV spread. Although primary cells isolated from chicken embryos can better mimic the in vivo process of ILTV infection, the instability of the biological characteristics of different isolates and the short lifespan of primary cells during in vitro culture limit their use in cellular and molecular mechanistic studies. LMH is the only cell line susceptible to ILTV infection in vitro. Our previous studies found that this cell line infected with ILTV can sufficiently mimic ILTV in ovo infection, and all Srcmediated mechanisms that we identified in LMH cells were validated in ovo, suggesting that LMH cells infected with ILTV are reliable in vitro models for studying ILTV infection (Li et al., 2015 (Li et al., , 2018 . In addition, we also analysed the only publicly available, genome-wide gene expression data of primary lung cells isolated from chicken embryos infected with a different virulent ILTV strain (Lee et al., 2010) , which again revealed that host Src is the central regulator of the molecular network induced by ILTV infection in host cells (Li et al., 2015) . All these results support the notion that the mechanism that we identified in LMH cells is universal in normal cells and tissues rather than a cell line-specific event. Thus, the LMH cell line was selected for the mechanistic study of Src regulation of ILTV infection in the present research. Further investigations using primary cultures of tissue samples or cells isolated from the mucosal epithelium of tracheal and conjunctival specimens infected with multiple ILTV strains are needed to determine the universality of the regulatory mechanism of Src on ILTV spread that we revealed in the present study.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1351, "end": 1367, "text": "(Li et al., 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1386, "text": "(Li et al., , 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1598, "text": "(Lee et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1743, "text": "(Li et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "ILTV causes an economically important chicken disease. Despite the extensive administration of live attenuated vaccines since the midtwentieth century and the administration of recombinant vaccines in recent years, infectious laryngotracheitis outbreaks due to ILTV occur annually worldwide, and there is no cure for it. Similar to other alphaherpesviruses, ILTV establishes latency in the trigeminal ganglia after acute infection of the upper respiratory tract, and reactivation of viruses from latent infection occurs frequently once host immunity is compromised. No drug or efficient treatment targeting ILTV latent infection is currently available. We previously identified Src as a key host determinate of ILTV infection. However, therapies targeting Src not only repress viral replication but also exacerbate the pathological effects of ILTV. The underlying mechanisms of the side effects remain unknown. Our present study suggests that host Src controls the cell-tocell spread of ILTV in a cellular fatty acid metabolism-dependent manner, which determines the CPE of ILTV.
