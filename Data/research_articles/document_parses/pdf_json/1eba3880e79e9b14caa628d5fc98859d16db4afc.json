Sequence analysis from 2310 viral isolates from Nexstrain reveals that residue at 614 of the viral spike protein is changed from a putative ancestral aspartic acid (D) to a glycine (G) between two viral clades. The G strain is predominantly on the East Coast of the United States, and the D strain is predominantly on the West Coast. This mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein spike is conserved in coronaviruses. Point mutations in a murine coronavirus spike protein can result in increased virulence through instability of the viral machinery and altered viral to cell membrane fusion. This observation may partially explain the discrepancy in predicted deaths from COVID-19 between the East Coast and West Coast,",

Examining clades of SARS-CoV-2 in 2310 geographically distributed viral DNA sequences using Nexstrain 5 (Figure 1 ) reveal that the B1 clade predominates on the West Coast of the United States, and the A2a clade, which apparently spread to New York through Europe and Italy if this limited viral sequence phylogeny analysis is correct, predominates on the East Coast.",

For example, analysis in Nexstrain in 2310 viral isolates of distribution of a non-synonymous mutation in the viral spike protein at codon 614 ( Figure 2 ) reveals that an aspartic acid (D) at this residue is predominant on the West Coast and a glycine (G) is predominant on the East Coast. SARS-CoV-2 genome phylogeny analysis reveals that this D614G mutation appeared to arise from an ancestral D residue (Figure 3 ). This mutation resides in a highly glycosylated region of the viral spike protein. A theory of viral pathogenesis 6 as well as cryogeneic electron microscopy (cryo EM) 7 and structure and function experiments 8 suggest the possibility that mutations in this region could alter this heavily glycosylated viral spike and alter membrane fusion in tissues, resulting in more pathogenicity and more human to human spread. This residue is highly conserved in coronaviruses 8 . There are many examples of mutation in this spike protein region resulting in changes in virulence 9,10 , and in particular a single serine to glycine change at residue 310 in a murine coronavirus spike protein resulted in increased virulence 11 through decreased stability of the viral fusion machinery.",

It is unclear whether current serologic or viral PCR based assays are able to detect this variability 8 . If this hypothesis is correct, it may be important to develop assays based on local viral clades, to determine the distribution of the virus and its spectrum of effects. It is may also be important for modelers to consider these possible variations in SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogenicity as models are developed for gradual relaxation of social restrictions. In particular, differences and timing of the activation of innate or adaptive immunity to the both viral strains as the pandemic progresses could be considered.",
