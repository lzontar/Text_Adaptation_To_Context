            "text": "Sepsis is a clinical syndrome with no effective protective or therapeutic treatments. Acacetin, a natural flavonoid compound, has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects which can potentially work to reduce sepsis. We investigated the potential protective effect of acacetin on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) ALI and dissect out the underlying mechanisms. Mice were divided into five groups: a sham group, a sepsis-induced ALI group, and three sepsis groups pre-treated with 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg body weight of acacetin. We found that acacetin significantly attenuated sepsis-induced ALI, in histological examinations and lung edema. Additionally, acacetin treatment decreased protein and inflammatory cytokine concentration and the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells in BALF compared with that in the non-treated sepsis mice. Pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was lower in the acacetin-pre-treated sepsis groups than in the sepsis group. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of acacetin on sepsis is related to the regulation of certain antioxidation genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), superoxide dismutases (SODs), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1).Taken together, our results indicate that acacetin pretreatment inhibits sepsis-induced ALI through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity, suggesting that acacetin may be a potential protective agent for sepsisinduced ALI.",

Sepsis is a potentially fatal wholebody inflammation (a systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS) caused by severe infection (Bone et al. 1992; Levy et al. 2003) . Sepsis develops when the initial host response to an infection is amplified and becomes damaging to the host (Weber and Swirski 2014) . Some structural components of bacteria (pathogen-associated molecular patterns-PAMPs), are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed in phagocytes and other cell types (Hargreaves et al. 2005) and are responsible for the initiation of the septic process. The process can lead to activation of NF-jB and transcription of several pro-inflammatory genes, including TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b.",

After2 days of acacetin treatment, mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneally, 40 mg/kg). Next, the ventral neck, abdomen, and groin were shaved and washed with 10% povidoneiodine. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture as previously described (Rittirsch et al. 2009 ). Briefly, the lower abdomen area was shaved and disinfected, a median 0.5-1.0 cm incision was made in the lower abdomen. After careful dissection, the cecum was ligated below the ileocecal valve, followed by a single' through and through' perforation (21-gauge needle); The caecum was replaced in the abdomen, and the incision was closed. After surgery, the animals were returned to their cages and were allowed access to food and water ad libitum.",

Furthermore, pulmonary MPO activity is also a reliable marker of pulmonary neutrophil infiltration (McCabe et al. 2001) . Therefore, we determined the MPO activity in the lung tissue homogenates and the number of infiltrated neutrophils in the BALF of mice in the different treatment groups at 24 h after sepsis induction. As shown in Fig. 3 , sepsis induction significantly increased the pulmonary MPO activity in the sepsis-induced ALI group when compared to the non-sepsis-induced, non-treated sham group mice. Furthermore, pulmonary MPO activity was dramatically lower in the acacetin-treated mice than in the sepsis group mice (Fig. 3a) .

To analyze the effect of acacetin on sepsis-induced inflammatory cytokine production, we determined the concentrations of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and MIP-2 in the BALF of mice in the different treatment groups using an ELISA assay. As shown in Fig. 4 , sepsis induction significantly increased the concentration of TNFa (Fig. 4a) , IL-1b (Fig. 4b) , IL-6 ( Fig. 4c) , and MIP-2 ( Fig. 4d ) in the BALF of sepsis-induced mice when compared to the sham group mice. Acacetin pre-treatment inhibited the elevation of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, as observed in the acacetin-treated sepsis mice. These results suggest that acacetin could inhibit sepsis-induced inflammatory responses in ALI mice.",

Previous studies have reported that antioxidative enzymes (AOEs), such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), could protect tissue against oxidative injury (Bhaskaran et al. 2013) . In our study we determined the expression of certain AOEs and the production of ROS in sepsis mice in the different treatment groups. Sepsis induction treatment led to reduced AOE expression of catalase, MnSOD, CuZnSOD, and GPx-1 (Fig. 6a) and higher production of ROS (Fig. 6b) in lung tissues of sepsis mice when compared to the non-treated sham group. However, treatment with acacetin significantly restored the expression of these AOEs and reduced production of ROS in lung tissues (Fig. 6a, b) .

Acacetin not only inhibited sepsis-induced decrease of HO-1 expression, but also increased the HO-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6c) . Next, to confirm the anti-oxidative protective activity of acacetin on sepsis-induced ALI, we measured ROS production in alveolar macrophages under different conditions.

Neutrophil activation, which increases sepsis-induced alveolarcapillary barrier permeability and results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is one of the mechanisms underlying the barrier's breakdown. In addition, it has been proposed that sepsis can induce pulmonary ROS production, and that ROS could increase local inflammation and thereby contribute to pulmonary tissue damage (Geerts et al. 2001) . Although a moderate amount of ROS is required for the innate immune system to kill pathogens, excessive amounts of ROS can cause harmful effects, including pulmonary tissue damage, apoptosis, and necrosis (Grommes et al. 2011) .

Additionally,microvascular endothelial injury could lead to higher capillary permeability. The increased capillary permeability enhances the entrance of protein-rich fluid into the peribrochovascular intersititium, leading to lung edema (Johnson et al. 2010; Antoine Roch et al. 2011) . We demonstrated that acacetin treatment significantly alleviated sepsis and the concomitant pathological changes in the sepsis-induced ALI mouse model (Fig. 1) , the wet-to-dry weight ratio (Fig. 2a) , protein concentration in the BALF (Fig. 2b) , MPO activity (Fig. 3a) , inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 3b) , and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 4) in the lungs of ALI mice.
