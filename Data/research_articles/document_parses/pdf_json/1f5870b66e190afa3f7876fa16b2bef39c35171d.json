This has also been seen in settings such as STEMI care in areas that have been affected by COVID-19 for longer periods of time 3 . The American Stroke Association has provided emergency guidance for overall hyperacute treatment of stroke during this crisis and individual institutions must devise emergency care pathways that provide systematic guidance to all members of the stroke team 4 .

The field of telemedicine has evolved rapidly since the COVID-19 pandemic. We are considering every aspect of patient care to reduce transmission and preserve PPE. Within one week of the declared crisis at UCSD, we deployed the use of internal telestroke evaluations in our CSCs. UCSD Information Services configured and deployed telemedicine carts (camera, monitor, microphone, speaker, and video codec or computer on a moveable system). Emergency Department (ED) Nurses and staff were educated about the telemedicine system and instructed on the COVID-19 adapted stroke code model (Fig 1) via centralized education by the ED nurse management team. Continued education was done with each stroke code activation. Each case is directed by a Stroke Provider, First Responder with Vascular Neurology faculty supervision (see role below). Our long-standing telemedicine program and expertise allowed for rapid deployment of this modality in our CSC. Hyperacute telestroke evaluations reduce exposure for clinicians and preserve the scarce supply of PPE.",

The 2019 Update to the Guidelines for Acute Stroke Management include recommendations for the use of TNK in certain conditions. A single bolus of TNK (0.25mg/kg IV maximum dose 25mg) may be reasonable in patients within 4.5 hours of onset or LKW, no contraindications to IV fibrinolysis, and anterior circulation large vessel or basilar artery occlusion 9 (Class Of Recommendation IIb, Level of Evidence B-R). TNK as a 0.4mg/kg single bolus has some guideline support in minor neurologic impairment with no large vessel occlusion (LVO) 6 (Class Of Recommendation IIb, Level of Evidence B-R). The frequency of neurologic and vital signs checks post-TNK are the same as post rt-PA treatment and therefore do not reduce the burden on nursing staff. 9 Given the class of recommendation and level of evidence, the UCSD Stroke Center has maintained Alteplase as the standard of care for acute stroke treatment at this time.

The UCSD Stroke Team is monitoring all TJC stroke code time metrics on every stroke code activation during this crisis. We are ensuring that there are no significant delays in time to treatment that could adversely affect patient outcome by including COVID-19 screening. The median door to needle time (DTN) at UCSD through December 2019 was 37 minutes and Door to groin puncture (DTG) was 36 minutes in telestroke transfers and 82 minutes in hospital arrivals. We have treated three patients with rt-PA since we implemented the adapted COVID-19 stroke code model. These cases had DTN times of 26 (EMS arrival), 38 (EMS arrival), and 59 (private car arrival) minutes. For the 59 minute DTN, the documented delay involved managing nausea/vomiting in CT scanner and a comprehensive discussion with the patient and family due to thrombocytopenia. One patient was treated with endovascular therapy in the 6-24 hour window with a DTG time of 24 minutes. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital after telestroke evaluation and the ET was pre-notified of the arrival. All team members donned PPE prior to the patient arrival. All four treated patients were initially screened as COVID-19 negative and did not subsequently become positive or display symptoms. Time metrics are being closely monitored in ambulance, private car/walk-up, and transfer patients. All treatment cases are reviewed at the weekly clinical team meeting to identify areas of improvement and analyze any delays in treatment. We will closely monitor quality and outcomes data and rapidly adapt our model to address any variances.",

The need to equip all healthcare institutions with some form of access to remote, robust, and compliant telehealth patient evaluation has been highlighted in this pandemic. Health systems and Providers must also evolve in the use of telemedicine. The reduction of barriers from federal agencies has allowed for rapid evolution of the uses of telemedicine in all aspects of healthcare. Providers require organized, but rapid, training in the practical use of telemedicine in patient evaluation. The UCSD Telemedicine Department and Chief Information Officers were integral to training over 1,000 Providers in a 7 day period on workflows and techniques of telemedicine. The UCSD system has provided tip sheets, frequently asked questions, and workflows on the institutional intranet and have also collaborated throughout the University of California system to rapidly transition to high quality, virtual care.",
