However, few methods except the Z-number considered the reliability of information. In this paper, we propose a multi-criterion decision-making method based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory and generalized Z-numbers. To do so, inspired by the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, we extend the Z-number to a generalized form which is more in line with human expression habits. Afterwards, we make a bridge between the knowledge of Z-numbers and the DS evidence theory to integrate Z-valuations. The identification framework in the DS theory is used to describe the generalized Znumbers to avoid ambiguity. Then, the knowledge of Z-numbers is used to derive the basic probability assignment of evidence and the synthetic rules in the DS theory are used to integrate evaluations.

But, in practice, the membership functions associated with an HFLTS are not easy to determine and the process of integrating HFLTSs is complicated. The most common method to integrate classical Z-numbers is to convert Z-numbers into classical fuzzy numbers, and then use the aggregation method of fuzzy numbers to make decisions. With the arithmetic operations of Z-numbers, Kang (2012) proposed a new multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) method in which the restriction A and reliability B are combined according to the canonical representation of multiplication operation of triangular fuzzy numbers. Later, Kang (2020), Kang (2018) applied Z-numbers to the environmental assessment under uncertainty and the stable strategies analysis in evolutionary games; Aboutorab, Saberi, and Rajabi (2018) extended the Z-numbers to the best-worst method and its application in supplier development; Peng and Wang (2018) developed an outranking method in which the cognitive information was represented by Z-numbers.

These uncertainties are hard to depict by crisp numbers. Initially, Zadeh (1965) proposed the fuzzy set theory to deal with uncertain problems. Later, scholars put forward the concepts of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, probabilistic linguistic term sets and their extended forms to deal with uncertain problems (Liao, Xu, Herrera-Viedma, & Herrera, 2018) . However, none of these methods except the Z-number (Zadeh, 2011) can reflect the reliability of information. A Z-number is an order pair of fuzzy numbers A B ( , ), where A represents the fuzzy restriction of information and B represents the probability measure of the reliability of A. Since Zadeh put forward the concept of Z-numbers, there has been an endless stream of research on Z-numbers. For example, Aliev and Alizadeh (2015) combined possibilistic and probabilistic distributions to propose a calculation model of discrete Z-numbers. After that, Aliev and Huseynov (2016) continued the discrete Z-numbers on the basis of discrete Z-numbers, and proposed the arithmetic operations of continuous Z-numbers.

The purpose is to use the existing evaluation information to generate Z-numbers.

Obviously, our method provides a solution to uncertain MCDM problem with reliability. On the other hand, the membership function in the form of triangular fuzzy number used by Liu et al.

In addition, transforming the reliability part of Z-numbers into triangular fuzzy numbers will lead to the distortion and loss of the original Z-evaluation information. In this respect, we generalize the elements of Z-numbers from classical fuzzy numbers or linguistic terms to HFLTSs, which enriches the representation form of uncertain information. In addition, the utility function is used to replace the membership function, which not only well conforms to the knowledge of the DS evidence theory, but also considers the mutual influence between evaluation levels.
