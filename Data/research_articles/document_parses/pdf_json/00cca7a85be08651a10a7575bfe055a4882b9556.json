The test used RNA internal control for sample extraction 99 and PCR amplification process control. To take into account the available sample volume and 100 the security conditions required for this virus before loading on the Cobas 6800 system, the 101 pre-analytical protocol has been adapted as recommended by the manufacturer as follows: 102 400 \u03bcl of each sample were transferred at room temperature into barcoded secondary tubes 103 containing 400 \u03bcl of Cobas lysis buffer for the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Then, the tube 104 was loaded on the Cobas 6800 where 400 \u03bcl from those 800 \u03bcl were used for RNA extraction, 105 and eluted in 50 \u03bcl of which 27 \u00b5l were used for the RT-PCR. The test was performed in 7 positive results either for both ORF1a/b and E genes or for the ORF1a/b gene only.

This kit contains only reagents for the SARS-CoV-2 real-time 117 RT-PCR step, extraction and amplification can be performed with various equipment listed in 118 the kit insert. In this study, RNA extraction was performed with MagNA Pure LC 2.0 System 119 (Roche) (Bichat hospital), QIAsymphony (Qiagen) (Saint Louis hospital) and NucliSENS\u00ae 120 EasyMag\u00ae (bioM\u00e9rieux) (Saint Louis hospital and Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital) according to 121 manufacturer's protocol. In each cases, 200 \u00b5l of nasopharyngal samples were diluted in 2 ml 122 of lysis buffer and eluted in 50 \u00b5l. Ten \u00b5l of extracted RNA was used to perform the real-time 123 RT-PCR with the LightCycler \u00ae 480 (Roche) in Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital or the ABI Prism \u00ae 124 7500 SDS (Applied Biosystems) in the two other laboratories. All these instruments are listed 125 into the RealStar assay instructions. The sample was considered as positive if at least one were performed on GraphPad Prism version 6.0. The negative results 130 obtained with the RealStar test were excluded from the analyses. All tests were two-sided, 131 with p values of <0.05 denoting statistical significance. The Ct values obtained with both 132 assays were compared in Wilcoxon tests, and we presented correlation curves with the 133 coefficient of determination, R 2 . Bland-Altman analysis was used to represent the degree period, and 140 with a positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 with the Cobas 142 6800. All the 30 samples collected in 2019 before the epidemic period were negative with 143 both Cobas 6800 and RealStar assays. The qualitative results of the 140 selected samples are 144 summarized in Table 1. Overall, the agreement (positive with the two tests regardless of the 145 gene detected) was 76%. Of note, 3 samples positive in gene E with the COBAS 6800 were 146 negative in gene E but positive in gene S with the RealStar assay. However, this rate differed 147 considerably depending on the Cobas 6800 E Ct: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was 148 99%. Only one sample with a Cobas 6800 E Ct at 34.3 was negative in RealStar assay with an 149 EasyMag extraction. For samples with a Cobas 6800 E Ct \u2265 35 (n = 49) only 14/49 was 150 positive in both techniques with a concordance of 29%. 151 For the gene E Ct < 35 obtained with Cobas\u00ae 6800, the median of the value obtained with 152 RealStar\u00ae assay was 23.5, 23.4 and 18.6 with EasyMag, QIAsymphony and MagNA Pure, 153 respectively. Moreover, for samples with a Ct > 35 with Cobas 6800 (n=49), the detection rate 154 observed with the RealStar assay differed depending on the extraction system, 1/13 with 155 EasyMag, 1/15 with the QIAsymphony and 13/21 with MagNA Pure. 156 Regarding the positive Ct values of gene E (n=104), linear regression analysis revealed a R 2 157 of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and 158 an intercept of -3.9 (Fig. 1a). The Bland Altman plot showed higher Ct values for the Cobas 159 6800 with a homogeneous distribution up to Ct 35 with a mean difference (Cobas 6800 minus 160 Comparison of the RealStar results after extraction with EasyMag and with a Ct between 25 and 34 and 15 with a Ct > 35) were extracted both with the 166 EasyMag kit and the QIAsymphony kit before RealStar testing. All the samples with a Ct < 167 35 (n=30) were positive regardless of the extraction system. Among the 15 samples with a 168 Cobas 6800 Ct > 35, all were negative after EasyMag extraction while 2 samples were 169 positive after QIAsymphony extraction (Ct: 34.9 and Ct: 38.8). We found a R 2 of 0.99 and the 170 Deming regression revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 0.99 and an intercept of -0.81 171 (Fig. 2a). Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (QIAsymphony minus 172 EasyMag) was + 1.1 Ct, with a SD of -0.70 Ct (Fig. 2b). Two differences exceeded 5 Ct 173 corresponding to the 2 samples positive using QIAsymphony and negative with EasyMag. 174 Although there was no significant difference in Ct values for the gene E (p=0.21), we have a 175 significant difference in Ct values for the gene S (p<0.0001, mean Ct gene S=1.19, 95% CI: 176 1.95 to 1.63) in favor of EasyMag. 177 DISCUSSION 188 In this study, two very different assays were compared: the RealStar assay used with various 189 extraction equipment, allowing a use in a wide range of PCR laboratories, and the Cobas 6800 190 kit used with the fully automated Cobas 6800 platform, allowing more intensive workflows. 191 As all other SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic tests, both assays are qualitative but yield a Ct 192 value inversely proportional to the amount of virus. In our work, below a Cobas 6800 Ct 193 value of 35, the qualitative results are highly concordant and the Ct values have a high 194 correlation even though the values of RealStar are lower than those of the Cobas 6800. Above 195 a Cobas 6800 value Ct of 35, the RealStar failed to detect about one third of the SARS-CoV-2 196 genes while COBAS 6800 detected at least one of both targets. However, this observation is 197 impacted by the extraction method in use, as demonstrated by the slightly lower Ct values and 198 higher positivity rate observed with the MagNA Pure system among samples showing E gene 199 Ct >35 with the COBAS 6800. This suggests a better extraction process with the MagNA 200 Pure system. The comparison, from same samples, between EasyMag and QIAsymphony 201 systems showed a slight improvement for the SARS-CoV-2 detection with QIAsymphony. 202 Among samples with Ct values above 35, the E target is mostly the only gene detected with 203",
