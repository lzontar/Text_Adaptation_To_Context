SARS-CoV-2 virus has very high genome sequence similarity to two other human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 2 . Therefore, it is highly possible that SARS-CoV-2 uses similar approaches to cell entry and replication in various cells and tissues. In fact, it is already known that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor ACE2 to enter the cells via its structural spike glycoprotein (S), yet with much higher affinity, which might translate to the massive SARS-CoV-2 spread as compared to SARS-CoV 3 . Host transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2; encoded by TMPRSS2) cleaves spike protein into two subunits, which is a necessary step for the virus fusion to cellular membranes and entry the cell 3 . Recent structural studies revealed that this process can be potentially inhibited by B0AT1 (S6A19; encoded by SLC6A19), an amino acid transporter, presence of which may block the access of TMPRSS2 to the cleavage site on ACE2 4 (Table S1 ).",

However, immune cells can be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2, as in case of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 7, 8 . Thus, it is highly possible that there are other receptors for virus entry in different cell types. Indeed, similarly with what has been shown in SARS-CoV, another receptor -CD147, called also basigin (encoded by BSG), has been recently shown to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in T cell lines and in cell lines of epithelial origin 9, 10 . Interestingly, the same receptor is a putative receptor not only for SARS-CoV, but also for HIV-1 and measles, as well as for malaria merozoites entry to erythrocytes [11] [12] [13] [14] . An anti-CD147 antibody that blocks infection with SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its humanized drug (meplazumab) has been already used in a clinical trial in patients with pneumonia. Meplazumab seemed to facilitate viral clearance, return to normal levels of lymphocyte count and decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) 10, 15 . The percentage of improvement in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 presentations seemed higher in weekly meplazumab treatment compared to patients on the conventional treatment 15 .",

As an additional function, it acts as a serine exopeptidase, cleaving peptides of various chemokines, growth factors and peptide hormones. Interestingly, it is also involved in extracellular matrix cleavage. It has been shown in human cells that several polymorphisms in CD26 gene reduce entry of MERS into the host cells 46 .

We did not find any significant correlations between BMI and age and the receptor-related gene expression in the bronchial biopsies. However, we noted that the expression of SLC16A3 (MCT4), ITGA3, LGALS3 in BAL positively correlated with BMI ( Figure 4A -C) and the expression of CD44 positively correlated with the age of the subjects ( Figure 4D ). Interestingly, whole blood expression of CD147 (BSG), PPIA, S100A9, CD44 and LGALS3 correlated positively with the BMI, whereas SLC16A3 positively correlated with age ( Figure 4 E-J).

All rights reserved Discussion COVID-19 pandemic is developing at such a pace that extraordinary actions are being initiated to learn quickly about its biology, transmission and potential means of prevention and treatment. In this spirit, we first performed an extensive literature and database search and curated a list of proven and potential receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and interaction partners, whose expression in different tissues and cells might be involved in the course of immunological response in COVID-19 ( Figure 6 ) 55 . Next, we analyzed these genes in the broad spectrum of cell types and tissues in healthy controls to evaluate the level of their expression and their coexpression profiles, as well as evaluated their expression in healthy children, adolescents and adults. While interesting associations were observed to be age-dependent, these findings must be further explored and repeated due to the possibility of batch-specific systematic variations in the gene expression values between in-house and public datasets. Despite our efforts in applying identical data analysis workflow for the datasets produced by our group and those available in public repositories, different sequencing facilities and experiment protocols can lead to altered gene expression values, especially for genes with extreme gene length and G/C content. Finally, we analyzed gene expression in adults with known and potential COVID-19 comorbidities and risk factors such as COPD, asthma, hypertension, obesity, smoking, male gender and AD. These conditions can be directly compared, as they were performed internally in the context of the same projects. In some comparisons limited number of samples were available and thus the results need to be confirmed in larger groups.",

Interestingly, we observed high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in bronchial airway epithelium: in HBECs ALI cultures in vitro, as well as in vivo in",

We have not observed the expression of SLC6A19 in any of the analyzed cells and tissues, yet it is known to be expressed is intestine 59 . Interestingly, in contrast to Leung and colleagues 60 , we have not seen higher expression of ACE2 in HBECs or bronchial biopsy of patients with COPD, but our sample size was very limited, and potentially a bronchial biopsy site was different, which might be the reason of this inconsistency. However, consistently with this report 61 , we observed higher expression of ACE2 in the bronchial biopsy of current smokers, which might indicate that current smoking status, might be a stronger factor of increased ACE2 expression in airway epithelium than COPD per se. On the other hand, ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) were reported to protect from severe acute lung injury in mice 62 , therefore an importance of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 progression should be further explored. In addition, in HBECs of patients with asthma, we observed higher expression of TMPRSS2, which increases the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 cleavage in asthmatic bronchi. Even though initially asthma was not reported to be a significant comorbidity for COVID-19, more observations from Europe and the US seem to show otherwise 63 . It might be related to the heterogeneity of asthma endotypes type 2 asthma (allergic) and non-type 2 (non-allergic). Allergen exposure, allergic sensitization and high IgE lead to lower ACE2 expression in the nasal and bronchial epithelium of asthma patients 64 . Thus, it is possible that ACE2 expression in the airways of allergic patients, even if slightly protective in terms of infection with SARS-CoV-2, might also predispose to faster progression of COVID-19 to more severe forms, especially in case of higher TMPRSS2 expression.",

Obesity is one of the main comorbidities reported in patients with severe COVID-19 63 , and since CD147 expression in the whole blood correlates positively with BMI in our cohort, it certainly needs further attention in relation to COVID-19. Importantly, CD147 expression is upregulated by high glucose concentrations 66 , which might reflect its correlation with obesity, and potentially also with diabetes, another very important COVID-19 comorbidity. Additionally, extracellular ligands and transmembrane partners of CD147 participate in the progress of other viral infections 12 in variety of mechanisms. Viruses integrate cyclophilin A and cyclophilin B in their virions and further can bind and either infect cells via 147 or activate CD147 signaling [11] [12] [13] . We found that expression of both cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB) is increased in subjects with hypertension and obesity and PPIA correlated positively with BMI in the whole blood, which is confirmed in other studies 67 . In addition, nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV binds to CD147 via cyclophilins and reduces interferon responses 25 in infected cells. It also inhibits NF-ATs translocation activation in T cells, leading to suppression of immune responses 25,68 . Both mechanisms might be more potent in obese patients, especially with hypertension, due to higher expression of both cyclophilins on the periphery. Also, the other extracellular ligand of CD147-S100A9 correlated positively with BMI.",

Recent studies reported that many COVID-19 cases developed nonpruritic, erythematous rashes, urticaria or varicella-like lesions 54, 74 , but so far it is not known if they are a place of viral replication or just a local reaction to systemic infection. Similarly, not much is yet known about the potential connections between AD and the course of COVID-19 75 . Yet, severe and untreated AD is a known risk factor for disseminated viral skin disease 76 The differential profile of ACE2-, CD147-and CD26-related gene expression in healthy subjects of different ages need to be interpreted with caution due to the distinct origins of these populations, as well as potential experimental bias (even if we performed normalization strategies, similar bioinformatic pipelines and cautious assessment of raw data quality, prior to analysis). Nevertheless, our observations are largely in agreement with other recent findings correlating gene expression in the whole blood and PBMCs with age 79 . Having this in mind, it is intriguing to observe that expression of NOD2, some MCTs, integrins and NFATs seemed to increase with age, whereas the expression of genes coding \uf067-secretase complex is decreasing with age in PBMCs.

In contrast to ACE2, we observed a prominent expression of CD147 (BSG) in epithelial and innate and adaptive immune cells in the lung (BAL), in the skin and in circulation (whole blood, neutrophils, classical monocytes, pDCs, ex vivo sorted ILC, NK, na\u00efve CD4 + T cells, terminal effector CD4 + T cells, na\u00efve CD8 + T cells, effector memory CD8 + T cells, na\u00efve B cells and plasmablasts) (Figure 1C, Figures S1-S3). Interestingly, ACE2 and CD147 (BSG) are not coexpressed in bronchial biopsy (Figure S2). High expression of CD147 (BSG) in primary human bronchial epithelial cells suggests that these cells having more than one receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry could be infected in various conditions. Granulocytes and macrophages are the main source of CD147 (BSG) expression 49 , which may explain high CD147 (BSG) expression in the whole blood and BAL observed in our data. Presence of CD147 (BSG) on innate and adaptive memory immune cells may indicate the importance of this receptor in systemic inflammatory response and development of immunological memory. Since it is not clear yet how exactly the process of infection via CD147 (BSG) takes place in case of SARS-CoV-2, we examined the presence and co-expression of extracellular partners of CD147 (BSG), which are implicated in the infection with other viruses using CD147 (BSG) for cell",

Low expression of ACE2-related genes was observed in both children and adults. Several CD147-related genes showed higher expression in adults, including CD44, certain MCTs, SLC3A2 (CD98), SLC2A1(GLUT1), NFATC1 and NFATC3. Also, CD26 (DPP4) was expressed at a higher level in adults. In contrast, other CD147-related genes were expressed at lower levels in adults, such as cyclophilins A and B (PPIA and PPIB), S100A9, SLC7A5 (CD98), LGALS3, integrins (ITGA6, ITGA3) and NFATC2.Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity and gender show different expression profiles of ACE2-, CD147-, and CD26-related genesWe analyzed expression of ACE2-, CD147-and CD26-related genes from different cells and tissues in various comorbidities and risk factors, which have been shown, or are suspected to predispose to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or COVID-19 progression.

CD26 (DPP4) is another receptor important in coronavirus infection, described in MERS-CoV, potentially recognizing SARS-CoV-2 21,77 . Similar to CD147, CD26 was expressed in all investigated cell types, except B cells. ILCs showed highest expression of DPP4 from all analyzed cells, which is in agreement with recent findings 78 .
