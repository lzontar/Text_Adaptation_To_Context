Members of the global radiation oncology community were invited to comment on issues relevant to the delivery of most effective care during the time of a global pandemic. The conversation was based around the themes of how to reduce transmission, mitigate consequences of reduced workforce and continue treatment in the presence of infection. Wakelet, a social media content organization platform, was used in real-time to summarize key insights to help guide the discussion and provide faster knowledge-sharing. Tweets were then reviewed and grouped into themes that formed the basis for these guidelines. A literature review supplemented data where available to expand on issues raised.

Brachytherapy may also increase risk of transmission during intubations or upper endoscopic procedures and necessitate increased PPE when they are in short supply. The National Health Service in England announced that from mid-April 2020, all elective surgery would be suspended as an indication of the likely pressures on anaesthetic staff and capacity.

Nonetheless, basic principles apply. Staff should wash hands between each patient contact and patients themselves should be instructed to wash hands or use alcohol hand rub entering the department. Some departments may choose to do temperature screening of staff, patients and any other visitors entering the department, as was employed during SARS [1] . When patients arrive for treatment and before they leave the department, they should be invited to wash their hands and provided with facilities to do so. Patient contact should be rationalised as much as possible and departments may wish to map the patient flow through their department and see what proactive steps can be made to reduce the number of staff members a patient may need to have contact with. Equally, staff movement around multiple areas of the department should be restricted as far as is practicable to avoid an infected member of staff passing that infection widely thorough all staff groups. If treatments are zoned within different buildings or satellite units, it may be preferable to keep staff within these units rather than rotate them to reduce cross-infection risks. Bringing together small autonomous functional teams will help with this. Staff should be included in discussions around changes in practice, such as the fractionation policies described in this paper. Regular communications should be sent, preferably in an electronic bulletin. All staff should be aware of their responsibilities to report infective symptoms and self-isolate if symptomatic. The teams in Singapore stressed that there should be ''no heroes\" and that all of those with symptoms, no matter their role, should self-quarantine.",
