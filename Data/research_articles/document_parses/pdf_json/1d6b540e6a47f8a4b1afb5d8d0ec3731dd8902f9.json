This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. Methods: Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions.",

Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants' self-reported safety scores for HCW's protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms.",

To prevent and control the epidemic, the Ningbo government encouraged people to stay at home; discouraged mass gatherings; cancelled or postponed large public events; closed public places [5] ; and set up 15 designated hospitals, of which five have treated for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients as of February 28, 2020 [6] .

One of the most important reasons for this could be that many HCWs lack contact with families [16] . They may also be afraid of the infection and of spreading the virus to their families [17] . Additionally, as most HCWs are shift workers, an occupation at higher risk for negative impact on family life, their families are demographically already particularly prone to mental health problems caused by family conflict [18] . Based on the above research data, we hypothesized that HCW families were likely to suffer from similar psychological problems during the COVID-19 epidemic, and that age, gender, educational level, occupation, nature of relationship with HCWs, COVID-19related life events, participants' knowledge of COVID-19 and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) could be significant risk factors for mental health problems in HCW family members [19, 20] .",

However, this prevalence was lower than those observed in a total of 1563 medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in a previous study using the same assessment instruments and cut-off scores as this study (44.7 and 50.7%, respectively) [28] . It is worth noting that this study was conducted in the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic when most Chinese HCWs had been facing the most severe phase of the epidemic, likely to be causing extreme psychological responses [16] . Comparing our current study data with similar studies conducted at the same designated hospitals, it was interesting to note that family members of HCWs were more likely to develop symptoms of anxiety and depression than HCWs (28.8 and 23.9%, respectively). Although one needs to be cautious when comparing data from different studies using inconsistent time frames and medical conditions, this finding demonstrates, to some extent, an extreme psychological impact in association with the COVID-19 epidemic in family members of HCWs. Studies have demonstrated that hospital-related transmission was suspected to be the possible mechanism of infection for affected HCWs [33] . Thus, it is easy to understand that family members (that is, HCWs), who had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, were associated with higher risk for anxiety symptoms among participants because they were excessively concerned that their families might be infected or even die. This is consistent with the results of a previous study that reported that family members of H1N1 patients suffer from anxiety [15] . Moreover, without proper personal protective equipment, COVID-19 may endanger HCWs [34] . As a result, it is understandable that participants who report a higher safety score for protective equipment of HCWs would believe that their families were better protected, and therefore, they were less likely to develop anxiety symptoms.",

            "text": "Our findings demonstrated that longer average working time per week worked by HCWs was significantly associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms among participants. Longer working time means that HCWs have to spend more time in contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, which may increase their chances of being infected with COVID-19 [33] , and cause depressive symptoms in family members [15] . Longer working hours are also more likely to eat into the family time of HCWs, and may therefore cause work-family conflict between HCWs and their family members, resulting in depression among both HCWs and their family members when coping with the conflict [35] . It is interesting to note that, compared to participants who were HCWs, enterprise workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms. Most enterprise workers have no medical background and may thus lack sufficient knowledge about the COVID-19 outbreak. They may develop depressive symptoms because they may lack the psychological endurance necessary for a pandemic [36] . In addition, many enterprises were forced to shut down production during the epidemic in China, resulting in the loss of income for their employees. However, loss of income as a predicting factor had the highest correlation with depression among enterprise workers, according to the results of a previous study conducted during the 2003 SARS outbreak [37] . Government or institutional employees were less likely to have depressive symptoms, this has been less documented in the literature. It is possible that this population were more likely to have access to clear and unambiguous information on the epidemic, so they are less likely to suffer from feelings of uncertainty, which is a known risk factor for depression during an infectious epidemic [38] . Moreover, compared to HCWs who suffer from depression during an infectious epidemic, including the COVID-19 outbreak [19, 20] , most government or institutional employees stayed away from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, and therefore had a lower risk of depressive symptoms than HCWs. Similar to the results of a previous study on H1N1 carried out in 2009, higher depression was noted among those in non-spousal relationships with HCWs, i.e., in our sample, these were parents and other next of kin [15] . Considering the majority of parents of HCWs were already elderly, one possible explanation is that the rapid transmission of COVID-19 and high death rate may have exacerbated the risk of mental health problems and worsened existing psychiatric symptoms among older adults [39] . We also speculate that most parents and other next of kin of HCWs have no medical background, and may therefore have a more extreme psychological response to COVID-19 epidemic, as previously discussed [36] .",

During this period of COVID-19 outbreak, most of the general population, including family members of HCWs, were isolated at home and received a great deal of information, as the government ran national messaging campaigns that constantly emphasized the dangers of COVID-19, especially for affected HCWs. Thus, family members of HCWs had more time to gather information through the Internet and the media about HCWs who treated COVID-19 patients [40] , for example on WeChat, which had a wider psychological impact, such as symptoms of anxiety and depression, among the public [17] . Moreover, the expression of this psychological reaction may be the normal protective response of the human body to the pressure of the epidemic; this also occurred during the SARS outbreak in 2003 [41] .",

Given the increasingly serious outbreak outside of China, the main implication of this study is that our findings could assist in developing mechanisms to help family members of HCWs in similar situations in other countries. In order to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression among this vulnerable population, several appropriate interventions are recommended as follows: first, health policy makers and stakeholders should collaborate to provide high-quality, timely crisis psychological services to HCW families. Online psychological self-help intervention systems, including online cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and anxiety (e.g., on WeChat), would be appropriate for HCW families [28] . Second, providing suitable protective equipment, work schedules, and accommodation to HCWs would benefit family members who are concerned about HCWs being infected. Third, according to the findings of previous studies [42] , social support appeared to have a protective effect on mental health problems due to possible conflicts between HCWs and their families. Thus, we strongly recommend both sides to take the initiative to communicate with each other to show their support. Finally, the government's propaganda strategies should be well-organized and effective [43] . The provision of reliable and transparent epidemic information to family members of HCWs is essential to enhance their sense of control and self-efficacy so they are able to cope with the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak [44] .",

Thus, we compared the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among target populations with that observed in the general population in China during the normal conditions, as we discussed above.
