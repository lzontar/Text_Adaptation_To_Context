The last patient is a 7-year-old girl diagnosed with a progressive highgrade glioma with an altered general condition. All patients have been transferred to ICU for a rapid respiratory degradation, mostly after a first phase with mild symptoms. At the time of writing, there was no death to report. One patient has recovered and was discharged from ICU. It is too early to give definitive outcomes for these patients. We will be able to gain more insight of the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric oncology as COVID-19 continues to spread and more data are collected.",

Up to April 16, 2020, an initial report from the French pediatric oncology centers has identified 33 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed cases of COVID-19 currently being managed. We want to focus here on five of these 33 children who are in intensive care units (ICU). Three patients (two boys aged 4 and 13 years, and a 19year-old girl) were diagnosed with relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and were immunocompromised by the chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive drugs they received.
