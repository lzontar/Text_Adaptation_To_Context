Although elective surgical procedures are being cancelled in many parts of the world during the COVID-19 pandemic, acute craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma will continue to occur and will need to be appropriately managed. Surgical procedures involving the nasal, oral, or pharyngeal mucosa carry a high risk of transmission due to aerosolization of the virus which is known to be in high concentration in these areas. Intraoperative exposure to high viral loads through aerosolization carries a very high risk of transmission, and the severity of the disease contracted in this manner is worse than that transmitted through regular community transmission. This places surgeons operating in the CMF region at particularly high risk during the pandemic. There is currently a paucity of information to delineate the best practice for the management of acute CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, a clear protocol describing optimal screening, timing of intervention and choice of personal protective equipment, is needed. The authors have proposed an algorithm for management of CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that urgent and emergent CMF injuries are addressed appropriately while optimizing the safety of surgeons and other healthcare providers. The algorithm is based on available evidence at the time of writing. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and more evidence and better testing becomes available, the algorithm should be modified accordingly.",

In the 21st century, however, 2 highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged from animal reservoirs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 1 Following reports of a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan, China in December, 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was ultimately determined to be the cause. 2 Since then it has become a global pandemic that continues to impact the provision of healthcare internationally. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that over 2 million people have been infected by the virus resulting in greater than 125,000 deaths. 3 The calculated fatality rate of the disease has been reported from 1% to 7% and ranges from 0.2% to 15% according to age groups. 4 In addition, 3.8% of infected patients occur in healthcare providers as a result of direct exposure in the work environment. 5 Despite all efforts, there continues to be an exponential increase in the number of patients reported internationally. Countries such as Italy, Spain, and the United States have become epicenters for COVID-19 with an unprecedented strain on healthcare systems. Flattening the curve through means such as social distancing have been proposed to limit the impact on healthcare systems by slowing the spread of COVID-19 across space and time. 6 Some regions have gone as far as a complete lockdown to attempt to curb the spread of the virus. 7 The COVID-19 is extremely contagious. The virus has been shown to be transmitted through aerosol/aerated solids or fluid from human secretions or discharges, as well as droplets from normal breathing, coughing, sneezing, and surface contact infected by symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers. During the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigation of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, 46.5% of infected individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing, and 17.9% of those infected never developed symptoms. 8-10 Furthermore, pediatric literature has shown that this disease may be asymptomatic in about 15% to 25% of children. 11, 12 Therefore, there is ample evidence that exposure of healthcare providers to asymptomatic patients is a real and imminent risk.",

Assuming up to 1 in 4 of those infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population continues to rise, the potential risk of exposure to asymptomatic carriers presenting with CMF trauma will become an even greater concern. 8 Moreover, healthcare providers infected during surgical procedures for CMF trauma, will experience much worse disease as compared to disease acquired through regular community transmission. This is speculated to be due to the high viral load generated during these highly aerosolizing procedures leading to aggravated cytokine release and more severe clinical manifestations. 11, 13 Multiple professional bodies have advocated for healthcare providers working in high risk environments such as CMF trauma to wear a minimum of N95 masks even if the patient is asymptomatic or negative for COVID-19. 18 If the patient is symptomatic or positive for COVID-19, then powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) are recommended to halt potential transmission to medical personnel if surgery must proceed. So far there has been a significant mortality of otolaryngologists and ophthalmologists in the Wuhan region, thought to be related to exposure to aerosolized virus from the nasal and oral airway mucosa from high risk procedures such as CMF trauma and sinus operations and in some patients despite the use of N95 masks. 19, 20 Given that the majority of CMF trauma procedures involve violation of the mucosa of the oral cavity and sinuses, these patients place the surgeons and the remainder of the operating room staff at high risk of exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. All elective surgical procedures should be cancelled during the pandemic for a number of reasons. This includes preservation of resources (both healthcare personnel and personal protective equipment [PPE]) in addition to potential risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, unless a complete lockdown occurs, acute CMF trauma will continue to occur and will need to be appropriately managed. There is currently a paucity of information to delineate the best practice for the management of acute CMF trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With a sensitivity of approximately 71%, a single PCR will miss some patients who are positive for COVID-19. 24 With 2 PCR tests performed at least 24 hours apart, this should decrease the number of false negative results. 25, 26 However, patients with CMF trauma may occasionally require emergent surgery which precludes the ability to take these precautions. Currently at our institution, the time for PCR results is approximately 24 hours. Although rapid testing modalities are currently being developed, their sensitivity and specificity will need to be determined before implementation as a preoperative screening modality. Ideally, if a highly sensitive, rapid testing modality becomes available, then it should be used for all patients upon presentation. In most countries, testing of asymptomatic patients is currently not possible due to limited testing resources. Furthermore, a history to risk stratify patients may not be attainable in some trauma patients.

[29] [30] [31] The initial critical step in the treatment of patients with CMF trauma is the clinical decision as to whether the patient requires surgery or can be managed nonoperatively. To conserve resources at this time, nonoperative management should be considered in patients where operative and nonoperative outcomes are known to be comparable, or where operative management offers no proven advantage. For example, condylar fractures that are amenable to nonoperative management (no malocclusion) should be managed nonoperatively during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For those that are difficult secondary corrections, which include displaced cranio-orbital fractures, orbital dystopia, nasoorbitoethmoid fractures, enophthalmic orbital floor fractures, and mandibular fractures requiring surgery, we would recommend proceeding with surgery following the acquisition of 2 negative PCRs and infection control and prevention clearance and prior to bony union.",

These include substituting closed reduction for open if amenable, avoiding intraoral incisions if possible, using a scalpel rather than monopolar cautery for mucosal incisions, using bipolar cautery on the lowest power setting for hemostasis, avoiding repeated suctioning and irrigation, avoiding power instrumentation if possible (including drill, burr, saw, etc), preferentially using self-drilling screws, and if drilling is required, avoiding or limiting irrigation and using a low speed drill. 19 In addition, we would suggest self-drilling maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) screws or Hybrid MMF (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) over traditional MMF with arch bars and wires to minimize the length of direct exposure to the upper respiratory tract in the OR as well as limit potential splashing of saliva onto the surgical team. Although closed reduction with MMF may avoid the need for intraoral incisions, it will require a minimum of one more AGMP for removal. The patient will likely also require several adjustments of elastics or wires in the clinic setting, which constitutes another instance of exposure. For this reason, when MMF is being used intraoperatively to guide open reduction and internal fixation of occlusal skeletal fractures (eg, mandibular fractures) but is not required to stabilize the fracture, we would recommend immediate removal of the MMF apparatus at the end of the initial procedure. If the MMF apparatus is required as a stabilizing modality for closed reduction, for instance in a condylar neck fracture, the patient should once again be asymptomatic and have had 2 negative PCRs >24 hours apart prior to MMF removal.",
