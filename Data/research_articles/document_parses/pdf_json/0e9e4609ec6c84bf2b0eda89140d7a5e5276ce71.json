Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof (111 mg/l), elevated D-dimers (35'000 ng/ml), elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (60 ng/l), prolonged prothrombin time (45 seconds [normal range: 26-37s]), and mild thrombopenia 126 x 10 9 /l. Arterial PaO2 was markedly decreased (28.7 mmHg). Although the patient was at intermediate-low risk for PE death at the time of diagnosis, the simultaneous presence of COVID-19 pneumonia, PE with a high clot burden and distal perfusion impairment, disturbed coagulation factors, and elevated inflammatory markers raised concern for exacerbation of COVID-19 and development of severe acute respiratory syndrome. For these reasons, the patient was treated with catheter-directed ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis (Figure, d) using two 6-French Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f catheters inserted through the right common femoral vein and placed in the right and left lung, respectively. A total of 30 mg of rt-PA were infused over 15 hours, and the patient's clinical condition improved rapidly. The next day, his heart rate was 85/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and PaO 2 raised to 86.9 mmHg under a reduced oxygen flow rate (5 l/min). A follow-up pulmonary CT angiogram demonstrated marked clot burden reduction, with a CT obstruction index of 27.5%.",

In our case, endovascular treatment was used to improve lung function efficiently because of concern related to the combined hypoxemic effects of impaired arterial perfusion and infectious lung inflammation, adding up and possibly exacerbating the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, this strategy is not recommended by the current guidelines. Awaiting further evidence, it should necessarily receive consensus from a",

Considering the currently limited knowledge concerning the interaction between thromboembolic disorders and COVID-19 pneumonia, this non-evidence-based management strategy was applied after careful review of the patient's clinical course by a multidisciplinary team. While not representative of the standard of care, systemic rescue thrombolysis was recently suggested in patients having intermediate-risk PE in case of deterioration under anticoagulation therapy [8], and other authors proposed thrombolysis for severely ill COVID-19 patients with acute PE [9].",
