As a result, they are less likely to pursue a graduate degree in the field. Complicating this issue further is the fact that shortages also exist among faculty in school psychology programs (Clopton and Haselhuhn 2009 ) as well as a lack of school psychology training options for students (i.e., the availability of training programs has only grown by 9% over the past 40 years) (Rossen and von der Embse 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 398, "end": 426, "text": "(Graves Jr. and Wright 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 619, "end": 646, "text": "(Clopton and Haselhuhn 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 808, "end": 839, "text": "(Rossen and von der Embse 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Perhaps a less understood, but equally important, factor contributing to shortages in the field is related to difficulties retaining practitioners in schools.

Emotional exhaustion refers to feeling tired and/or fatigued within the context of one's work and includes feelings of being overextended and being drained of one's emotional and physical resources within the work environment. Feelings of depersonalization are characterized by a general sense of detachment from one's job and can include the adoption of callous, uncaring, or even hostile/ negative attitudes toward others (i.e., colleagues and/or clients). Finally, a reduced sense of personal accomplishment is defined by feelings that one is not accomplishing anything worthwhile at work and, thus, experiences a lack of motivation to perform one's job. This conception of job burnout is represented on a validated measure of these feelings, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (Maslach and Jackson 1986) . Ratings of items on this measure result in an overall burnout score as well as scores for current perceptions of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment.

A field already faced with significant shortages needs to determine the possible reasons for practitioner burnout as well as strategies that can be implemented to prevent it or address it. Past research has estimated that an alarming rate (up to 90%) of school psychologists report experiencing some feelings of job burnout at some point during their careers Randolph 2017, Schilling et al. 2018 ) most often in relation to increased feelings of emotional exhaustion and a lessened sense of personal accomplishment (Boccio et al. 2016; Mills and Huebner 1998; Schilling et al. 2018) .

The purpose of the current study was to examine perceptions among practicing school psychologists of effective strategies training programs can utilize to address job burnout in the field. More specifically, participants' openended responses to this question embedded within a larger survey regarding perceptions of feelings of job burnout were examined and resulting themes were identified. It is thought by the authors that by beginning to address the topic of job burnout and equip trainees with strategies to deal with these feelings when they occur, future practitioners are then less likely to experience resulting negative consequences including leaving the field entirely. This is especially important given that significant job shortages in the field continue to persist (Castillo et al. 2014) .

Regarding the identification of teaching advocacy skills to students as a means for dealing with burnout in the field, this finding is again supportive of previous research demonstrating that engaging in advocacy efforts can help workers, including school psychologists, to increase levels of motivation to \"push through\" difficult feelings of burnout, particularly emotional exhaustion (Fernet et al. 2016) .

As recent research has demonstrated that practitioners in this area of the county tend to report higher rates of job burnout with up to 90% reporting some feelings of burnout during their careers (Schilling et al. 2018) , it is reasonable to believe that practitioners in other areas of the country experiencing lower levels of burnout may identify other potentially useful strategies for addressing the issue.
