The latter mechanism, an inducible pathway capable of degrading entire organelles, involves sequestration of the target within double-membrane vesicles called \"autophagic vesicles\" or \"autophagosomes,\" followed by fusion with lysosomes and enzymatic degradation of the vacuolar contents. Autophagy is an important response to cellular starvation and is involved in development, differentiation, and remodeling. There is now evidence that autophagy is an important component of innate immunity to microbial invasion.",

In mutant cells deficient in autophagy, S. pyogenes instead multiplied, with release of large numbers of viable bacteria from the cell.",

M. tuberculosis survives within phagocytic cells as a result of its ability to interfere with the phagosome maturation pathway, resulting in failure of phagosome-lysosome fusion. However, autophagy can be induced in infected macrophages by nutrient restriction or by IFN-g, resulting in reduced mycobacterial viability. The action of IFN-g is independent of reactive nitrogen or oxygen activity. Autophagy also appears to play a role in defense against other intracellular pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, an organism that escapes into the cytosol by causing membrane lysis, only to potentially be greeted by an autophagosome.",
