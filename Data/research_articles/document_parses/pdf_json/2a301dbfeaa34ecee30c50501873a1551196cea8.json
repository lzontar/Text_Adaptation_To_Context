Moreover, very limited information is available about SARS-CoV-2 expressed regions and immune responses. In this paper an effort has been made, to facilitate vaccine development by proposing multiple epitopes as potential vaccine candidates by utilising SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome data. Here, publicly available RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHBE and A549 human cell lines were used to construct SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome to understand disease pathogenesis and immune responses. In the first step, epitope prediction, MHC class I and II gene identification for epitopes, population coverage, antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservation and crossreactivity analysis with host antigens were performed by using SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, and in the second step, structural compatibility of identified T-and B-cell epitopes were evaluated with MHC molecules and B-cell receptors through molecular docking studies. Quantification of MHC gene expression was also performed that indicated high variation in allele types and expression level of MHC genes with respect to cell lines. In A549 cell line, HLA-ANHBE cell lines. Prevalence of HLA-A*24 alleles was suggested as risk factors for H1N1 infection, and associated with type-1 diabetes. HLA-C*03:03, linked with male infertility factors was also highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cell lines. Finally, three potential T-cell and five B-cell epitopes were selected for molecular docking studies with twenty-two MHC molecules and two B-cell receptors respectively. The results of in silico analysis indicated that proposed epitopes have high potential to recognize immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae and subgenus Sarbecovirus. It is responsible for the widespread global pandemic causing an upper respiratory tract infection of humans [1] . SARS-CoV-2 virion ranges from approximately 50-200 nm in diameter [2] . SARS-CoV-2 is made up of four structural proteins known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane) and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The nucleocapsid protein contains the viral RNA and the spike, membrane, envelope make up the viral envelope. The spike protein is responsible for the viral attachment with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and facilitates entry into the host cells [3] . The ACE2 receptors are present in the goblet (secretory) cells of ciliated cells in the nose, back of the throat, lungs, gut, heart muscles and kidney which facilitates the hand to mouth transmission route. The viral RNA is released in the nasal cells when the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) splits the spike proteins, and enters inside the cell, the viral genetic material replicates into millions. Seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 took place within four days of infection and was found in most patients by day 14 and persistent specific IgG and antibody production was reported even after 2 years of infection [4] . Whereas limited serological details of SARS-CoV-2 are available at the moment, it is reported that a patient showed the presence of IgM after 9 days of infection, and later production of IgG after 2 weeks [5] . In an in vitro plaque testing with patient sera, it was confirmed that it is able to neutralize SARS-CoV highlighting the successful mounting of humoral response [6] . The current evidences have shown that Th1 immune response can be successful for controlling SARS-CoV and may work for SARS-CoV-2 as well, since the epitopes overlap for both, the T-epitopes can be identified and will be valuable for designing the cross-reactive vaccines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 445, "end": 448, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 517, "end": 520, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 919, "end": 922, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1547, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1758, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1926, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Epitopes are the antigenic regions of an antigen, causing an immune response which is identified by antibodies generated from T-and B-cells.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than four million people worldwide, and contagious nature of virus has imposed the biggest challenge of COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Therefore, vaccine design, development and production against COVID-19 diseases is an urgent requirement to protect people from the rising viral attacks. In practice, whole process of vaccine development takes several years to be completed[43]. But, integration of immunological understanding, high throughput genomics technologies, and bioinformatics tools and techniques can help us to design effective and safe vaccines in a short duration.

Epitopes with higherantigenicity and immunogenicity scores will have a higher probability of binding with T-and Breceptors to elicit an effective immune response. MHC proteins helps to distinguish cell own proteins from foreign proteins such as viruses and bacteria. Thus, the binding affinity of these epitopes to MHC protein is another very important criteria.
