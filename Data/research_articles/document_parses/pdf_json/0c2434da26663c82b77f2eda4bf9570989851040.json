The current epicentres are in Europe and North America and the epidemiological curve was predicted to peak in most affected countries between April and May, with possible further epidemic waves thereafter. 4 The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly has the capacity to overwhelm healthcare systems, even in affluent societies. This is due not only to the unprecedented surge of patients but also a likely, concomitant and high infection rate among doctors and nurses. About 10% of the reported cases in China and Italy have been among healthcare workers. 5 In our hospital, a cohort of 538 asymptomatic staff members participated in a UK study that aims to ascertain the prevalence of asymptomatic viral carriage in healthcare workers. As we passed through the initial surge of COVID-19 cases, nearly a quarter of them were found to be antibody positive, by ELISA testing and only 3% were positive to testing by polymerase chain reaction.

Outpatient activity has been reduced and nonurgent diagnostic tests and elective treatments have been postponed. Such changes have inevitably reduced hospitals' capacity to manage other conditions. Neurosurgical care is clearly impacted by these COVID-19 responses. Elective surgical procedures have been cancelled so that operating theatre staff and equipment can be utilised for critical care. Outpatient activity has been reduced, both to redirect resources and to lower transmission of the disease, by decreasing the footfall in hospitals. Neurosurgeons have faced unprecedented challenges, including working outside their area of expertise, prioritization of neurosurgical cases with limited resources, facing new ethical dilemmas and being exposed to moral injuries, medicolegal risks and, in some cases, to financial uncertainties. Neurosurgical training and research have also been reduced and non-COVID related global health work has been suspended (Table 1) . New working models and systems have needed to be developed, within a short period of time, to ensure safe neurosurgical practices as far as possible. 6 Neurosurgeons have needed to rise to these challenges and take collective actions, in their local settings, to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1447, "end": 1448, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1285, "end": 1294, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the UK, all elective work, neurosurgical and otherwise, has been curtailed, to allow for reallocation of resources at the frontline of the response.

Consequently, the neurosurgical workforce has been engaged in task shifting and task sharing. 7 These radical changes have required rapid re-training of neurosurgical staff, not just to manage the initial COVID-19 surge but also to support a maintenance phase for the duration of the pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 472, "end": 473, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Re-deployment"}, {"text": "Neurosurgeons are well aware of the importance of maintaining good tissue oxygenation, to ensure viability of central nervous system but, beyond this, may feel uncomfortable in managing severe pneumonia or ventilated patients, let alone renal, lymphoreticular and other organ system failures that affect the more severely affected COVID-19 patients. In our hospital, focused training and collaboration with other specialties has nevertheless helped us to build resilient teams, able to provide appropriate care to patients. Areas where transferrable skills can be applied are being explored, for example application of theatre-based lifting and patient transfer skills, in providing a \"proning\" service for ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have elected to re-deploy trainees initially, leaving senior staff to assume a significant component of providing the care of neurosurgical patients. Whilst not required to date, we have the option of senior trainees filling gaps in neurosurgical duty rotations and retired neurosurgeons may be asked to return to work.

Up until the pandemic, most neurosurgical departments have been able, for the most part, to control allocation of their finite resources. Local mechanisms have been in place, to ensure fair and ethical decisionmaking. In most settings, especially in the developed world, neurosurgical patients have not been competing with other patients for resources. Those at a high-risk of imminently developing neurological disability have been prioritized. In low and middle-income countries, priority setting has usually been more complex, due to more limited resources.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 110, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Priority setting"}, {"text": "The situation now has changed dramatically.

Neurosurgery is particularly affected, not least because many modern-day neurosurgical procedures are dependent upon availability of ICU capacity for post-operative care.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Priority setting"}, {"text": "The peak of the present crisis, in individual countries and states, is likely to put local neurosurgeons under pressures not previously encountered in normal times. In terms of obtaining the best benefit from finite resources, priority may need to shift from treating the sickest to treating those most likely to respond to aggressive intervention. Parameters that were irrelevant or inappropriate previously may now direct our decisions to treat. Factors may include the availability of drugs, equipment, theatre time and ICU capacity, but also life expectancy after surgery and age of the patient. The threshold to intervene neurosurgically will likely increase. Those particularly disadvantaged by these factors are elderly, vulnerable and frail people. A particular consideration for this group of patients, in the context of neurosurgical pathology, is their concomitant higher risk of mortality from COVID-19, if they are being treated in a COVID positive hospital. There is clear pressure for neurosurgeons to avoid bringing these patients into hospital and standard treatments may therefore need to be replaced by suboptimal treatment methods. The risks of complications and unfavourable outcomes will inevitably increase.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Priority setting"}, {"text": "By way of example, in our hospital, some patients with a radiological diagnosis of malignant brain tumour were not offered surgery as per our standard neuro-oncology pathway, but primary radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy instead. Withholding or delaying these and other neurosurgical procedures may result in significant neurological impairment, or even death, in patients who would otherwise likely have faced a more favourable outcome. In particular, benign pathologies that cause raised intracranial pressure, or lesions that compress the brainstem, the optic apparatus, the spinal cord or the cauda equina, all have a time-critical component to their treatment. Such neurosurgical patients should not be unjustifiably disadvantaged over COVID-19 patients. The most common urgent neurosurgical conditions that require ICU admission are intracranial haemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, with mortality rate of between 30 and 45%. 9, 10, 11 For COVID-19 patients, the in-hospital mortality rate is also, regrettably, high, at 28% overall, but it is much greater, at over 50%, among those requiring mechanical ventilation. 12 In contrast, the prognosis for patients admitted to ICU following elective neurosurgical procedures is much more favourable. 13 There are currently no data to suggest that critically ill neurosurgical patients have been denied access to treatment as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. It is nevertheless still early and the full impact of the pandemic will not be established until after the crisis. Furthermore, the effects of COVID-19 will likely not be the same across the world. In some countries and cities the situation has been kept under control and, hopefully, may remain so throughout the duration of the pandemic. At the same time, some geographic locations have not reached their epidemic peak. Epidemiological predictions are uncertain and it remains unclear still, quite how the pandemic will evolve.

Governments worldwide will, and already are being judged on their responses to this pandemic. Their prioritising the management of COVID-19 is understandable, but this approach inevitably limits the access to healthcare by other patient groups, leading to \"collateral damage\" and potential inequalities in health care. Neurosurgeons must therefore establish strategies that recognize and mitigate potential healthcare injustices against their patients. They should monitor their therapeutic activity in the light of any new demands placed upon their services. They should continue to audit their own practices and outcomes, identifying and highlighting any shortcomings arising out of the current crisis. They should participate in higher-level, managerial decision-making, acting as advocates for their patients. They should ensure that any new knowledge gained is appropriately utilized, in developing future solutions to public health issues such as COVID-19.
