At the time of writing (end of May 2020), more than 5 million cases were confirmed worldwide according to the COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). To fight the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of clinical trials were initiated or are in planning to investigate novel therapies, diagnostics and vaccines. Some of these make use of novel, efficient trial designs including platform trials and adaptive group-sequential designs. An overview and recommendations are provided by Stallard et al (2020) . While considerable efforts have been made to set up trials in COVID-19, the vast majority of ongoing trials continues to be in other disease areas. In order to effectively protect patient safety in these trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, across the world, clinical trials answering important healthcare questions were stopped, or temporarily paused to possibly re-start later, some with important modifications. Here we consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on running trials in non-COVID-19 indications. The challenges to these trials posed by the pandemic can take various forms including the following: (1) The (amount) of missing data may preclude definite conclusions to be drawn with the original sample size. (2) Incomplete follow-up (possibly not at random) may invalidate the planned analyses. (3) Reduced on-site data monitoring may cast doubt on data quality and integrity. (4) Missed treatments due to the interruptions, but also due to acquiring the SARS-CoV-2 virus may not be random and require a different approach than based on the intention-to-treat principle. (5) Circumstances (in e.g. usual care, trial operations, drug manufacturing) before, during and after the pandemic induced interruptions may differ substantially with impact on interpretability of the clinical trial data, through which the original research question is more difficult or even impossible to answer.

Even if the pandemic will last past the scheduled end of the trial, the primary outcome (pregnant yes/no) can still be ascertained even if a woman is not able to attend the final visit in person on time, albeit that according to the statistical analysis plan the continued exposure to the IUD needs to be confirmed by the investigator. Nevertheless, the contraceptive failure rate observed over the whole trial may be impacted not only by a potential loss in confirmed exposure time but also by other COVID-19 related intercurrent events. For instance, a couple who usually commutes long-distance on weekends is not at risk of contraceptive failure during the lockdown if they observe the lockdown living apart, but they are possibly at a higher risk if they observe the lockdown living together. However, given the treatment policy estimand and the very low rate of contraceptive failure with an IUD (Mansour et al, 2010) these intercurrent events are not likely to be relevant for the interpretation of the trials results.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1213, "end": 1234, "text": "(Mansour et al, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Long acting reversible contraception: The devil is in the detail"}, {"text": "It should be noted that other endpoints of the trial may also be impacted by COVID-19 related intercurrent events.

Recruitment to the trial started in February 2018, with a planned sample size of 221 with the potential to stop the study for efficacy or futility at a number of interim analyses. The primary endpoint was shoulder function 12 months after surgery measured using the Constant Shoulder Score (CS) recorded at a hospital out-patient visit, with assessments taken at 3 and 6 months following surgery also used for interim decision-making (Parsons et al, 2019) . Due to the coronavirus pandemic, recruitment to the study was delayed by the cancellation of elective surgery in UK hospitals. The study team are working closely with the Data Monitoring Committee in reviewing the planned timing of the interim analyses to reflect this, and the resulting change in the anticipated numbers of patients with 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up data at different time-points in the study. The pandemic also threatened disruption of the collection of follow-up data for patients for whom surgery had already been completed, as even prior to lockdown, many patients in the study, a large proportion of whom are in vulnerable groups, were unwilling to attend planned appointments for assessment. In order to be able to obtain follow-up data from as many patients as possible, the study team decided to change the primary endpoint to be the 12 month measurement of the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), as this does not require face-to-face data collection, but can be completed by post or over phone (or app). As this had originally been included as a secondary endpoint in the study, data were available for all completed patients.

For this reason there is generally a reluctance to modify the design of a clinical trial during its conduct for fear that the scientific integrity will be compromised. The necessity of a severe pause in recruitment in many trials due to the current pandemic, however, raises questions of whether additional analyses can be added to an ongoing trial to enable the data obtained so far to be analysed now, with a decision of whether or not to continue with the trial at a later post-COVID-19 time. Although the current situation of clinical trials being conducted in the setting of a global pandemic is without precedent, the particular question of adding interim analyses to a trial is not a new one. Proschan and Hunsberger (1995) introduced the concept of a conditional error function specified prior to the first analysis of accumulating data to be a function that gives the conditional probability of a type I error given the stage 1 data, summarized by a standardized normal test statistic, z 1 .

For ongoing clinical trials initially planned with interim analyses, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a desire to modify the timing of the planned analyses. Analyses are often taken at times specified in terms of the information available, which may be proportional to the number of patients for a normally distributed endpoint, or to the number of events for a time-to-event endpoint, or given by the number of events for a binary endpoint. Changes to the timing of the interim analyses do not generally lead to an inflation of the type I error rate provided these are not based on the observed treatment difference, and the spending function method (Lan and DeMets, 1983) can be used to modify the critical values used to allow for such changes. If the timing of interim analyses is based on the estimated treatment difference the type I error rate can be inflated using a group-sequential test (see, for example, Proschan et al (1992) ).

Even without pandemic disruptions, there are various reasons why studies could change over time: Some sites may only contribute to part of study, the study population may change over time, e.g. for reasons of a depleted patient pool, and the disease under study itself may vary over time. While many of these reasons also apply to fixed sample size designs, multistage and especially adaptive trials are under obligation to deliver justifications of why the stages can be considered sufficiently homogeneous in order to test a common hypothesis. The EMA reflection paper on adaptive designs states that \"Using an adaptive design implies [...] that methods for the assessment of homogeneity of results from different stages are pre-planned\" (EMA , 2007) . One option they give is the use of heterogeneity tests as known from the area of meta-analyses. However, as Friede and Henderson (2009) point out, this can reduce the power of studies substantially even in case of no heterogeneity: Such tests are typically carried out at a higher significance level than the standard ones, thus accepting a higher false positive rate. An addition they bring forward is searching for timewise cutpoints in the data. Conclusions about the relationship between timing of change and occurrence of interim analyses can then be drawn from the resulting findings. In the current COVID-19 situation, the challenge statisticians face is similar to the general challenge described above. The nature and the severity of the impact will very much depend on the actual situation of the trial and the disease under study. Consequently, the way to deal with them may differ as described elsewhere in this paper. Here, we will focus on the question of whether the COVID-19-related changes are such that a rescue by introducing an adaptive design seems justifiable from the homogeneity aspect. There is one major difference to the situation described in the preceding paragraph: The presence of one or two cutpoints, depending on whether the trial will continue both during and after COVID-19, can be taken as a given. Also the question of whether the changes are due to a possibly performed interim analysis or due to COVID-19 seems moot; the question we need to answer is whether a combination is justified.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 830, "end": 842, "text": "(EMA , 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 953, "end": 980, "text": "Friede and Henderson (2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment-effect heterogeneity"}, {"text": "In some cases, it will be obvious that a combination is not warranted.

In other cases, it may not be that obvious and there might be reasons to believe that the pooled patient set is suitable to answer the study hypothesis. Due to the reasons listed above, again a formal heterogeneity test will not be the tool of choice. The EMA Draft Points to Consider on COVID-19 (EMA , 2020b) does not make mention of the burden of proving homogeneity; rather it states the need of \"additional analyses [...] to investigate the impact of the three phases [...] to understand the treatment effect as estimated in the trial\". While this does not give sponsor carte blanche to combine as they wish, it clearly leaves room for a number of approaches of justifying combination, both from a numerical and a medical perspective. The estimand framework will be an important factor in the decision on pooling or not pooling the data as it will make arguments visible in a structured way: If estimands differ between study parts, then no meaningful estimator for them will be obtained from pooled data (see also Section 5).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Treatment-effect heterogeneity"}, {"text": "What can statistical methodology contribute if it must be conceded that pooling the patients is not justifiable? In some situations, the number of patients before the COVID-19 impact may already be sufficient to provide reasonable power (see Section 4.1). In this case, also patients in the COVID-19 timeframe would need to be analyzed, but it is unclear how they might be included. General guidance for such patients is given as repeating the analysis including all patients and discuss changes in the treatment effect estimate. Medical argumentation will then be needed to underpin the assumptions that changes are due to COVID-19. In some cases, causal inference can help estimate outcomes from those patients under the assumption that COVID-19 had not happened. If interested in the treatment effect in a pandemic free world, it might be worth clarifying the question of interest by relating to the estimand framework (ICH , 2019) where COVID-19 is seen as an intercurrent event. Alternatively, one could standardize results from all patients to the subgroup of patients pre-COVID-19 (e.g., Shu and Tan (2018) and Hernan and Robins (2020) ).

Here, the first stage test statistic z 1 is defined by the cohort of patients included before the interim analysis, but the data used comes from the primary endpoint. For patients who were included before the COVID-19 impact but for whom the primary endpoint was observed after that impact, this would mean that their primary endpoints would need to be analysed together with those occurring before the impact. A disadvantage of this test procedure is that it prohibits early stopping for efficacy. In situations where it is not feasible to obtain sufficient information from the pre-COVID-19 patients, it may be advisable to support the interim analysis with historical data (Van Lancker et al, 2019). Sooriyarachchi et al (2006) proposed a score test for incorporating binary assessments taken at three fixed time points. Galbraith and Marschner (2003) expanded the likelihood-based approach described in Marschner and Becker (2001) to continuous endpoints assessed at an arbitrary number of follow-up times with a proposition of extending the topic to group sequential designs or conditional power approaches. This approach was generalized by Hampson and Jennison (2013) to a group sequential design with delayed responses. A shortcoming of these approaches is that they do not take into account baseline covariates in order to make fully efficient use of the information in the data. In addition, the incorporation of baseline covariates and longitudinal measurement of the clinical outcome is likely to involve a heavier dependence on statistical modelling, which raises concerns that their misspecification may result in bias. This problem is overcome by Van Lancker et al (2020) . They propose an interim procedure that is applicable for binary and continuous outcomes assessed at an arbitrary number of follow-up times and that allows the incorporation of baseline covariates in order to increase efficiency. They realise this by considering the estimation of the treatment effect at the time of the interim analysis as a missing data problem. This problem is addressed by employing specific prediction models for the long-term endpoint which allow, besides multiple short-term endpoints, the incorporation of baseline covariate information. When measurements are taken at three different timepoints (baseline, intermediate and final), the probability of a successful primary endpoint in each treatment arm is estimated by 1. fitting a model for L j on S j and the baseline covariates in the cohort of patients for whom all data is available, and using the model to make predictionsL j for all patients for whom S j is observed 2. fitting a model forL j on the baseline covariates in the cohort of people for whom S j is observed, 3. taking the mean of the predictions based on the model in Step 2 for all patients recruited at the time of the interim analysis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 716, "end": 743, "text": "Sooriyarachchi et al (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 837, "end": 867, "text": "Galbraith and Marschner (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 920, "end": 947, "text": "Marschner and Becker (2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1186, "text": "Hampson and Jennison (2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1698, "text": "Van Lancker et al (2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Use of early read-outs"}, {"text": "Implementing their estimator for the treatment difference in the conditional power approach improves decision making at an interim analysis both for futility stopping and sample size re-assessment without compromising the type I error rate, even if the prediction models are misspecified.

In that case, the type I error can be preserved by defining the first stage p-value by the cohort of patients included before the interim analysis (e.g. Friede et al, 2011; Jenkins et al, 2011) .

One way of considering these types of heterogeneity is to use Bayesian approaches during, if possible at all, or at the end of the trial. Using hierarchical Bayesian methods associated with Bayesian evidence synthesis methods will allow to account for different type of heterogeneity (Friede et al, 2017; R\u00f6ver et al, 2016; Thall and Wathen, 2008) . These approaches take into account uncertainty in estimating the between-trial or subgroup heterogeneity but they can also be used in the setting of withintrial heterogeneity. By using potential variation of the scale parameter of the heterogeneity prior would facilitate sensitivity analyses. Friede et al (2017) proposed a Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses with priors covering plausible heterogeneity values. In the setting of within-trial heterogeneity prior calibration of each source of heterogeneity is at most interest, indeed one should not be limited to methods accounting for only one source of heterogeneity as more than one type can be present. Let \u03c6 be the within-trial standard deviation, it determines the degree of heterogeneity across patients either included before or after COVID-19 pandemic or patients infected or not by COVID-19 (or any other COVID-19 source of heterogeneity) and \u00b5 the parameter of interest.

Moreover, the use of a Bayesian approach entails the question of what constitutes sensible prior information in the context of COVID-19 in which there is a continual updating of information that is still not considered reliable. This may be argued on the basis of the endpoint in question, that is, what is the plausible amount of heterogeneity expected, what constitutes relevant external data, and how this information may be utilized. A relatively simple solution would be the use of weakly informative priors.

But many other decisions may not require unblinded access. Some, including initiating a sample size re-assessment or updating a study's final statistical analysis plan (SAP), could be very problematic in terms of validly interpreting final analysis results if initiated by a party with access to unblinded interim results such as a DMC. In current practice and supported by prior regulatory guidance, such decisions are generally initiated by parties remaining blinded.

An estimand provides a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question posed by the trial objective. It summarizes at a population-level what the outcomes would be in the same patients under different treatment conditions being compared. Central to the estimand framework introduced in ICH (2019) are intercurrent events, which occur after treatment initiation that affect either the interpretation or the existence of the measurements associated with the clinical question of interest. Generally, the intercurrent events due to COVID-19 can be categorized into those that are more of an administrative or operational nature (e.g. treatment discontinuation due to drug supply issues), and those that are more directly related to the effect of COVID-19 on the health status of subjects (e.g. treatment discontinuation due to COVID-19 symptoms), see Akacha et al (2020) .

The situation is different in adaptive designs with a preplanned selection of a population at an interim analysis (as this does not change the estimand), when following the usual recommendations for an adequately planned trial (which includes the need to pre-specify the envisaged adaptation in the study pro-tocol). Care has also to be taken if the pattern of intercurrent events is different before and after an interim analysis, in line with the usual recommendations to assess consistency across trial stages in an adaptive design.

One particular concern is the possible shift in the study population after the onset of the pandemic. At present we see a notable decline in hospital admissions for non COVID-19 related diseases. It can be assumed that patients with less severe problems tend to postpone a hospital stay for fear of an infection in the hospital or for not putting stress on the already overloaded health system in some countries.

It is then important to be mindful about the fact that pre-specification of the study protocol and the SAP is the corner stone to avoid operational bias in any clinical trial. Although the ICH (1998) guideline allows changing the SAP even shortly before unblinding a trial, this if often viewed as critical by stakeholders. Changing the characteristics of a trial based on unblinded trial data always requires appropriate measures to control the type I error rate whereas changes triggered by external data are often seen more lenient. In the case of changes to the conduct and/or analysis of a trial caused by the pandemic it is reasonable to assume that such changes are not triggered by the knowledge gained from the ongoing trial. Still, changes will have to be pre-specified and documented, as appropriate. It is recommended to pre-specify key analyses important to interpret the objectives of the trial in the statistical analysis plan, in particular analyses related to the inferential testing strategy. Therefore we suggest to consider first whether different analyses are needed for the primary or key secondary objectives.

Social distancing measures may be kept in place and it is to be expected that the trend of, for example, fewer hospital admissions for minor cases will continue to some extent. Nevertheless, certain trials interrupted by the pandemic will be able to restart, albeit in a possibly changed environment. The trial of the long acting contraceptive (Section 2.1) was largely unaffected by the onset of the pandemic. The START:REACTS trial (Section 2.2) had changed its endpoint to a PRO measure that can be observed remotely if a patient does not wish to come to the clinic. This trial can restart recruitment when elective surgeries will be again possible, albeit with the new endpoint as the original endpoint was not always measured during the lockdown measures. The ATALANTE 1 trial (Section 2.3) was stopped for ethical reasons due to the study population being at high risk of COVID-19. As the trial did not proceed to its second stage, consultations with agencies have started to discuss the partial results in view of the clinical unmet need. Such discussion will be likely focus also on the loss of power even if first stage was promising. This begs the question, how promising the first stage results should have been to provide convincing evidence if a dilution of the treatment effect cannot be excluded a priori and the considerations in Section 4 of this paper may support such discussions. Lastly, the CAPE-Covid and the CAPE-Cod studies (Section 2.4) are both addressing ICU patients with two kind of pneumonia. There is heterogeneity in disease and patients prognostic. For the moment, the CAPE-Cod trial is temporarily stopped but is planned to restart next autumn.
