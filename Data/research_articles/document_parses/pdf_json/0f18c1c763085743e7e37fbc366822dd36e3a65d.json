Residents have been asked to read studies remotely to reduce exposure even with a significantly decreased total volume of imaging cases. Many nonessential outpatient imaging and procedures have also been cancelled, further limiting educational opportunities.

The platforms enable users to host webinars, virtual meetings, video demonstrations, videoconferences, and online training. Virtual meeting solutions have long been in use in the business sector with great reported impacts on employee productivity. More recently, there have been numerous applications in the medical community from patient education to multidisciplinary conferences (11, 14) . Specific to the field of radiology, VCPs have historically been applied primarily to didactic education (10), with virtual conference sessions commonly offered both at international and national conferences, such as the Radiological Society of North America, American Roentgen Ray Society, and American Society of Neuroradiology, as well as at local forums. Previous studies discussing the use of remote conference systems have shown positive reviews from both faculty, fellows, and residents, citing convenience and flexibility (12) . Moreover, the use of VCPs has not resulted in any quantifiable decrease in performance on either in-training or board examinations (12) . While webinars and other web-based teaching are not new to the realm of radiology education, its use as a daily clinical teaching tool in lieu of in-person real-time clinical sessions has not been addressed.",

For this reason, the ACGME requires residents to review a minimum number of studies (radiographs, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine (NM)) to acquire this essential skill set. An important but sometimes neglected part of this learning process is the feedback that ideally should subsequently be provided to the trainee during a read-out session.

Another downside to the potential virtual workflow is that only a single computer screen can be shared per person at a given time, whereas many radiologists typically use three to four screens at once to display necessary information and images. Effort must be made by the host computer or attending to keep the relevant images and series on the shared screen. Overall image quality is another factor that must be considered, as the remote participants are viewing a compressed stream of the host's display, rather than a high-resolution PACS image directly. Additionally, if the host computer is sharing the screen of a diagnostic monitor, the participants' monitors may not be of equal resolution, requiring the inconvenience of viewing smaller images or having to pan around the full-resolution screen image. The combination of these factors might also make virtual read-outs slower than a standard in-person readout, and thus video-conferencing should be used selectively.",

For instance, there have been recent reports that data-mining features within the Zoom software allowed users to covertly access another user's LinkedIn data (23) . Although Zoom's security has been marketed as \"end-to-end encrypted,\" this is only true when participants are using Zoom native and web apps (24) . When users join using a device that is not connected through Zoom's communication protocol, such as a mobile phone, the encryption cannot be directly applied. These devices are connected through \"Zoom connectors\" which do not necessarily offer the end to end encryption that the Zoom native applications offer, though a BAA established with any VCS vendor should mandate the protection of even decrypted PHI flowing through that vendor's infrastructure. Awareness of the encryption systems employed and the history of vulnerabilities exposed and corresponding vendor responses is essential when selecting a vendor and establishing a BAA. We have specifically focused on Zoom in this paper as a current widely deployed solution, not as an endorsement of a specific vendor. We encourage radiologists to take on Before a participant can obtain remote control access, the host will be prompted to approve the request. This serves as another layer of defense against unwanted interruption of the video-conference.

Finally, regardless of how effective the current technology is, it will never be as good as an inperson interaction. Lack of potential visual clues provided by other people's body language can lead to a loss of engagement and can dehumanize the supervising radiologist to trainee rapport. It can also be harder to engage with someone through a video screen, which leads to decreased focus from vulnerability to outside distractions. Moreover, a small time delay between responses that often occurs with video-conferencing can result in stilted conversations.",
