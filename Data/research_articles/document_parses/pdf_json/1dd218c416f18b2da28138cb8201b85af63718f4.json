Is there a reasonable classification of these objects (e.g. by invariants)? One nice property expected from a useful classification is that it makes the classified objects easier to handle algorithmically. Even if the general classification of a class of objects is impossible, sometimes there is a useful hierarchy of objects in this class, e.g., the Cantor-Bendixson rank of a scattered Polish space, the Ulm type of a reduced abelian p-group, etc. We would expect that the algorithmic, algebraic, or topological complexity of objects increase from lower to higher levels of a hierarchy. Can you make this intuition formal? Is it possible to formally measure the algorithmic complexity of a given classification or a hierarchy, or perhaps show that there is no reasonable classification at all? Can algorithmic tools help us to define useful hierarchies?",

The main underlying theme here is applying computability theory to a classification problem or a hierarchy; neither the problem nor the hierarchy has to be computability-theoretic. The discussed results can be informally split into three categories: I. Local effective classifications. Given some classical metric or Banach space we ask which elements of the space satisfy a certain property. For example: Which real numbers are normal? Which continuous functions are regular? And so on. II. Global effective classifications. How hard is it to classify, say, compact Polish groups? What about compact Polish spaces? To answer these questions formally we extend methods of computable structure theory to computable separable spaces. III. Applications of computability to hierarchies. Usually elements of higher levels of a given hierarchy are expected to be more complex. Computability theory can be used to make this intuition formal. Such results are clearly related to (I), but there are also explicit connections with Weihrauch reducibility and with theme II.",

Instead, Melnikov proves a computable version of the celebrated Pontryagin duality which is then used to apply effective algebraic results [14, 16] to topological groups.

What is the complexity of the Pontryagin dual of a computable compact connected abelian group? (The profinite case is known.) 8 Computability of the metric is obviously not enough. Unlike the Banach space case, there is nothing like the Mazur-Ulam theorem for topological groups. For example, every separable profinite group is homeomorphic to the computable Cantor space, but obviously not every profinite group is computable. Perhaps, computability of \u22121 can be dropped at least in some cases, but this has not yet been explored. 9 But there is again a tight connection with categoricity.
