Hypertension was present in 20.89% of patients. The counts of white blood cells (WBCs) and lymphocytes were normal or decreased in 86.67% and 99.11% of patients. CRP was increased in 86.22% of patients, PCT in 10.67%, and ESR in 90.22%. CT showed that 86.22% of patients had multiple patchy glassy shadows in both lungs, particularly in the peripheral area. Thirty-seven (16.44%) patients were diagnosed with severe COVID-19. Methylprednisolone was administered in 44.44% of cases. The mortality among the patients was 0.89%. Conclusions: Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the tertiary hospital near Wuhan are very similar to those found in Wuhan, but the lower mortality.",

Fever, cough, multiple patchy glassy shadows on CT images of the peripheral and posterior lungs, and normal or decreased white blood cells are the common clinical feature of COVID-19, while some of patients showed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or death. Early epidemic investigation showed that the Wuhan Huanan seafood market may be the first identified source of infection 7 , but solid data have shown the possibility of a person-to-person spread [10, 11] . None of the patients included in the current study had any direct or indirect connection with the Huanan seafood market. It has been known that the SARS coronavirus utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter the cell [12] . ACE2 receptor is a relatively new member of the renin-angiotensin system, and the maintenance of normal ACE2 levels in the lung promotes resistance against inflammatory lung disease [13] . SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses enter and damage the cells is still unclear. The studies of Huang et al. [14] and Zhang et al. [15] have found that, respectively, 6 of 41(15 %) and 42 of 140 (30 %) COVID-19 patients have hypertension. In the present investigation, the incidence of hypertension was 45.95 % (17of 37patients) in the severe COVID-19 group compared to 15.96 % (30 of 188 patients) in the non-severe group. This finding is consistent with the notion that hypertension is a high risk for COVID-19 patients. However, the mechanism underlying this link is unknown. The possibility can be raised that high blood pressure may damage ACE2 receptor-expressing endothelial or alveolar epithelial cells in the lung.",

Defining the role of these factors will require further studies. The study confirmed that hypertension is a high-risk factor of the disease.
