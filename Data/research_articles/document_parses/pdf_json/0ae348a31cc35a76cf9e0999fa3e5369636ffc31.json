An indirect ELISA assay suggested that when mice were vaccinated with rSPV-SA, the level of IgG against TGEV was enhanced dramatically. The cytokine assays were employed and the results indicated that both the Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine levels raised after vaccination with rSPV-SA in mice models. Results from the passive immunity protection test of new born piglets demonstrated that the recombinant live-vector vaccine, rSPV-SA, could 100% protect piglets from the SPV infection, and there was no significant clinical symptom in the rSPV-SA treatment group during this experiment.

Although the virus is capable of infecting swine of all ages, suckling piglets are the most susceptible and have a mortality rate up to 100% [1] . TGEV is a pleomorphic enveloped virus containing a positive-stranded RNA genome and four structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the integral membrane (M) protein, the minor envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Among which, the spike (s) protein, one of the key structural membrane proteins of coronaviruses, is an attractive target for generating neutralizing antibodies against the virus due to the critical role it plays in the host cell invasion [2, 3] . Precisely, the S protein mediates the attachment of virus particles to targets via binding of itself to the specific receptors. At the N terminus of the S protein, there are four antigenic sites, A, B, C, and D, which have been shown to be involved in the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 1 ) [4] . Previous studies have determined that the A site (which is fully dependent on glycosylation for proper folding) is predominantly responsible for stimulating neutralizing host antibodies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 282, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 758, "end": 761, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 762, "end": 764, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1075, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1267, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1271, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1275, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1279, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1283, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1284, "end": 1288, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1062, "end": 1069, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "SPV is a natural mild attenuated virus and has been widely applied as a vaccine.
