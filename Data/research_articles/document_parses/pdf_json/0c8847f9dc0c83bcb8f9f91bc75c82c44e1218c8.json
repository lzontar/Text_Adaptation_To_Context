            "text": "Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin that have gained 23 worldwide distribution. OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All 24 three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE 25 acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity 26 towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to 27 humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced 28 evolution-population d ynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site 29 mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations 30 selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation 31 of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site 32 substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to 33 optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor 34 usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among 35 CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental 36 to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human 37 and animal pathogens. 38 39 The subfamily Orthocoronavirinae comprises a group of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses of 40 clinical and veterinary significance. Adding to the socio-economic impact of coronaviruses (CoVs) 41 already extant in humans and livestock, the emergence of 'new' CoVs through cross species 42 transmission poses an ever-looming threat to public health, animal health, and food production. 43 Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans, but not all of them have become established. The 44 introduction of SARS CoV in 2002 from horseshoe bats with masked palm civets as incidental transient 45 hosts, was rapidly contained through quarantine measures 1 . MERS CoV, natural to dromedary camels, 46 causes a classical zoonotic infection with limited human-to-human spread 2 . December 2019, a 47 member of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), called 48 SARS-CoV-2 and 79.5% identical to the 2002 SARS CoV variant, emerged in Wuhan, China 3,4 to progress 49 to full scale pandemicity. Chances are, SARS-CoV-2 will eventually become established in the human 50 population.",

Among them are HKU1 and OC43 (subgenus Embecovirus, 53 genus Betacoronavirus), related yet distinct viruses that arose from different zoonotic progenitors and 54 entered the human population independently. OC43 is far more related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV), 55 its presumptive ancestor, with early isolates sharing 97% genome identity 8,9 . Together with viruses of 56 swine, canines, equines and lagomorphs, OC43 and BCoV are considered host range variants of the 57 virus species Betacoronavirus-1 (collectively referred to as \u03b21CoVs throughout) 7 . OC43 apparently 58 emerged 70 to 130 years ago from a single cross species transmission event that gave rise to a human-59 only virus [8][9][10] . Like OC43, other \u03b21CoVs also exhibit host specificity 8,11 . While these observations attest 60 to the host promiscuity and zoonotic potential of embecoviruses and \u03b21CoVs in particular, they are 61 also indicative for the existence of host barriers, the breaching of which selects for adaptive mutations 62 that result in host specialization and, ultimately, virus speciation. Conceivably, comparative studies of 63 4 BCoV and OC43 may identify factors that promote or restrict cross species transmission of CoVs and 64 thus further our understanding of the requirements for colonization of the human host.",

The receptor binding sites (RBSs) of CoV HE lectin 79 domains and those in related proteins of toro-and influenza C/D viruses 22,33-35 differ in sequence and 80 structure yet conform to a common architectural design with a deep hydrophobic pocket ('P1') to 81 accommodate the crucial sialate-O-acetyl moiety, and an adjacent pocket or depression ('P2') to 82 accept the 5-N-acyl group 17,21,22,33 .

In MHV, HE expression is dispensable for replication and rapidly lost 90 during cell culture propagation 15 . Conversely, in \u03b21CoVs, HE seems critical for infection. In OC43, loss 91 of HE-associated acetyl esterase activity abrogates the production of infectious virus and virus 92 dissemination in cell culture 37 . Moreover, acetyl-esterase inhibitors impede BCoV replication 19 , and 93 antibodies against HE neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo 38-40 . Still, even among \u03b21CoVs there are 94 differences in HE function apparently correlating with host specificity. Whereas HE lectin activity is 95 strictly maintained in BCoV 28 , OC43 lost this function through progressive accumulation of mutations 96 in the HE RBS, apparently as an adaptation to replication in the human respiratory tract 11 . 97 Nevertheless, isolates of either virus propagate in cultured cells. To better understand the 98 consequences of loss of HE lectin function as it occurred during OC43 and also HKU1 evolution, we 99 took a reverse genetics/forced evolution approach with BCoV as a model. The findings reveal that HE 100 and S are functionally interdependent and that the acquisition of HE by a proto-embecovirus allowed 101 its \u03b21CoV descendants to adopt strategies for reversible virion-sialoglycan attachment, remarkably 102 similar to those of influenza A viruses.",

To study the role and importance of HE in 105 \u03b21CoV propagation, we developed a reverse genetics system for BCoV strain Mebus (sFig. 1A) based 106 on targeted RNA recombination 41,42 . Recombinant 'wildtype' BCoVs (rBCoV) with parental type HE and 107 S, but with accessory ORF4a replaced by the Renilla luciferase gene (rBCoV-Rluc), were readily 108 generated upon seeding acceptor-virus-infected, donor RNA-transfected mouse LR7 cells onto 109 monolayers of feeder HRT18 cells. rBCoV-Rluc arose and within seven days grew to final titers 110 routinely obtained for wildtype BCoV (~10 8 TCID50/ml). 111 Generating BCoV-Rluc derivatives defective in HE lectin function proved more cumbersome. To 112 abolish the HE RBS, we substituted Phe 211 , which is key to ligand binding 17 (sFig. 1B), by Ala via two 113 nucleotide substitutions to block reversion. Mutant viruses were recovered eventually, but, in 3 out 114 of 4 successful trials, a multistep 160-hr rescue did not suffice and an additional 72-96 hr blind passage 115 was required (Fig. 1A). 116 Sequence analysis of clonal virus populations, obtained by endpoint dilution, confirmed the presence 117 of the HE Phe 211 Ala substitution in all cases. Surprisingly, the purified viruses all suffered single site 118 mutations in S, clustering in domain S1 A (aa 15-302) in proximity of the RBS (Figs. 1A-C; sFig. 2). Two 119 of the trials yielded multiple S variants and some variants -Thr 83 Ile and Leu 89 Pro-emerged 120 independently in separate experiments (Fig. 1A). The mutations map to three distinct S RBS elements 121 (Fig. 1C, sFig. 2C; nomenclature according to 32 ).

OC43 USA/1967 S1 A may not share this preference. Apparently 316 due to its low affinity, detectable binding to BSM was lost upon depletion of either type of Sia (sFig. 317 6A). Moreover, even though BCoV-Mebus S preferably binds to 7,9-di-O-Ac-Sia, monovalent one-on-318 one binding of the BCoV S1 A domain to \u03b12,6-linked 9-O-acetylated Sia is still 3-fold stronger than that 319 of OC43-USA/1967 as measured by biolayer interferometry (sFig. 6B). On a cautionary note, the 320 isolation and complex passage history of OC43-USA/1967 43,44 entailed several passages in human 321 tracheal organ culture, suckling mouse brain and many rounds of replication in cultured cells 9 , which 322 would have given the virus ample opportunity to adapt to the in vitro conditions. Thus, the binding 323 characteristics of its spike may not faithfully reflect those in circulating field variants.

Our findings 329 demonstrate that in the prototypic \u03b21CoV BCoV the envelope proteins S and HE are functionally 330 entwined and co-evolve. We posit that the same hold s for other members of the species 331 Betacoronavirus-1, including its zoonotic descendant human coronavirus OC43 and related viruses of 332 swine, rabbits, dogs and horses, as well as for other Embecovirus species, most prominently among 333 which human coronavirus HKU1. The data lead us to conclude that the respective activities of S and 334 HE in receptor-binding and catalysis-driven virion elution are balanced to ensure dynamic reversible 335 virion attachment and, thereby, efficient virus propagation. In consequence, for the viruses listed 336 above, the roles of S and HE during natural infection cannot be understood in isolation but must be 337 considered in unison. 338 Using a reverse genetics-based forced evolution approach with BCoV as a model system, we showed 339 that loss of HE lectin function causes an offset in S-HE balance, practically incompatible with virus 340 propagation and spread. With the HE lectin domain as modulator of esterase activity, mutations that 341 decrease or abolish HE RBS affinity reduce virion-associated sialate-O-acetylesterase activity towards 342 clustered glycotopes on hypervalent glycoconjugates 11 such as are present in the mucus and 343 glycocalyx in natural tissues and on the surface of cultured cells.

Different from HE, NA may do so 434 via its catalytic pocket which doubles as a Sia-binding site 72 . However, NA also possesses a second Sia 435 binding site 73,74 , which like the HE lectin domain, regulates NA activity and which, in further analogy, 436 is conserved or lost in apparent correlation with host tropism 75-77 . Finally, among many other 437 similarities to embecoviruses, influenza A variants with different set points in their HA-NA functional 438 balance may cooperate to support their propagation in cultured cells 48 . Our observations establish 439 that there are common principles of virion-sialoglycan interactions that prompted convergent 440 evolution of \u03b21CoVs and influenza A viruses. Although these two groups of viruses essentially differ in 441 genome type and replication strategy, envelope proteins, and receptors, they seem to be subject to 442 the same rules of engagement with respect to dynamic receptor-binding, the differences between 443 them constituting variations on a theme. This implies that observations made for the one system are 444 informative for the other. Perhaps more importantly, insight into the overriding principles of virus-445 glycan interactions may open avenues to common strategies for antiviral intervention.",

            "text": "The findings allow for several conclusions. (i) They confirm and firmly establish that loss of HE lectin function selects for mutations in S1 A that reduce S receptor-binding affinity and virion avidity. (ii) The 233 possibilities to reduce the affinity of the S RBS through single site mutations are finite. In several 234 independent experiments, substitutions in S1 A occurred at a limited number of positions albeit not 235 necessarily by the same residue. For example, Asn 27 was replaced both by Ser and Tyr. (iii) The 236 mutations that reduce S affinity fall into different categories. Most map within or in close proximity of 237 the RBS to affect receptor-ligand interaction directly. Others, like His 173 Tyr and Pro 174 Leu, are more 238 distal from the RBS and apparently affect ligand binding indirectly through long range conformational 239 effects. A third type of mutations, quasi-random Cys substitutions, apparently disrupt S1 A folding by 240 promoting non-native disulfide-bonding. While an Arg 197 Cys substitution strongly decreased secretion 241 of the S1 A -Fc fusion protein, the biosynthesis and intracellular transport of native trimeric spikes was 242 seemingly affected to lesser extent. At least, the uptake of S-Arg 197 Cys into VSV pseudotypes was not 243 noticeably impaired as compared to that of wildtype S (sFig. 3E). Still, the mutation did alter the 244 infectivity of the pseudotyped particles making them less dependent on exogenous HE-Fc (sFig. 3F) 245 presumably by reducing the avidity of S trimers through local S1 A misfolding and consequential 246 disruption of the RBS in one or more monomers. (iv) Perhaps most surprisingly, quasispecies 247 developed in which loss of HE lectin function was compensated at the level of the viral population 248 with minority low affinity variants, constituting less than 6% of the swarm, not only sustaining the 249 replication of high affinity variants but actually allowing the latter to flourish and amplify to become 250 the majority phenotype.",

Among the first 252 mutations fixed upon zoonotic introduction and early emergence of OC43, was a HE-Thr 114 Asn 253 substitution, which created a glycosylation site at the rim of the lectin domain RBS 11 (Fig. 3A) . Glycans 254 attached to HE Asn 114 hamper binding to 9-O-Ac-Sia through steric hindrance, causing a 500-fold 255 reduction in HE avidity (Fig. 3B) and a 125-fold in sialate-O-acetylesterase-activity, respectively ( Fig.   256 3C). We introduced the HE Thr 114 Asn substitution in BCoV, expecting that the glycosylation site would 257 be rapidly lost through any of several single-nucleotide restorative mutations in HE. Indeed, NGS analysis of the virus swarm arising after targeted recombination showed the glycosylation site to be 259 destroyed but only in 10% of the population and exclusively by Ser 116 Phe substitution (Fig. 3D) . This 260 mutation partially restores HE receptor binding and receptor destruction to 0.125 and 0.17 of that of 261 wildtype HE, respectively (Fig. 3B, C) . In the vast majority of viruses, the newly introduced HE 262 glycosylation site was retained and, instead, S1 A mutations that reduced S affinity were selected again, 263 with S-RBS Thr 83 replaced either by Ile (69%) -as seen before (Figs. 1A, 2C; Table 1 )-or by Asn (10%) 264 (Fig. 3D) . The latter mutation reduces S1 A affinity to 0.008 of that of wildtype.",

The observations led us to entertain the possibility that the mutations 269 in S1 A and HE did not occur independently and that, even in viruses expressing low affinity spikes, 270 partially restorative mutations in HE would yet provide a selective advantage. To test this, the clonal 271 S1 A -Thr 83 Asn/HE-Thr 114 Asn variants were serially passaged. All three viruses independently lost HE 272 Asn 114 glycosylation over time and, saliently, through Ser 116 Phe substitution exclusively. Even more 273 remarkably, with HE-Ser 116 Phe mutants gaining dominance, variants emerged that had restored S 274 affinity to (near)wildtype through substitution of S1 A -Asn 83 either by Thr or by Ser (Fig. 3E) . 275 For one of the five clonal populations obtained by endpoint dilution, we unfortunately failed to 276 determine its genotype for technical reasons. From the NGS analysis of the p1 population, we deduced 277 that the starting mutant must have been a low affinity S1 A -Leu 89 Pro variant that, like the S1 A -278 Thr 83 Asn/Ile variants described above, quickly lost the HE-Asn 114 glycan through an HE-Ser 116 Phe 279 substitution. Oddly enough, the Leu 89 Pro substitution had not been detected by NGS in the pre-cloning 280 virus stock. Note, however, that this mutation had been selected before twice independently in trials 281 with rBCoV-HE-F 211 A ( Table 2) . Possibly, it arose spontaneously during end point dilution procedure.",

            "text": "Cell culture adapted BCoV and OC43 strains differ in their set point of the S/HE balance. The impact 303 of loss of function mutations in the BCoV HE lectin domain was unexpected, because this defect seems 304 well tolerated by the prototype OC43 laboratory strain USA/1967. In HRT18 cells, it grows to titers 305 comparable to those of BCoV reference strain Mebus. Next gen sequencing of OC43 stocks revealed306    heterogeneity, but no indications for the existence of low S affinity minority variants that would 307 support replication of majority high S affinity viruses. Also, clonal virus populations obtained by end 308 point dilution (10/10) all conformed to the S1 A master sequence. We offer that instead OC43-In expanding clonal populations of HE-defective rBCoV-HE-F 211 A, propagated in the absence of 354 exogenous receptor-destroying enzyme activity, viruses with reduced S affinity gained a selective355 advantage initially. Upon prolonged passage, however, quasispecies developed in which loss of HE 356 lectin function was compensated at the population level. Variants that combined the HE-Phe 211 Ala 357 mutation with (near) wildtype affinity S proteins increased to dominate the swarm at least 358 numerically. Still, these high affinity S variants for their proliferation were strictly reliant on minority 359 low affinity S variants. This relationship extends beyond cooperativity and group selection described 360 for other systems 46-52 and amounts to a state of dependency. We propose that the virions of the low 361 affinity minority variants provide aid by serving as a source of exogenous sialate-O-acetylesterase 362 activity. They themselves evade decoy receptors through enhanced reversibility of virion attachment, 363 but this phenomenon increases their motility -whether by sliding diffusion or binding-rebinding-364 causing them to deplete cell surface 9-O-Ac-Sias, decoy receptors and functional receptors alike. With 365 increasing concentrations of low affinity virions in the culture supernatant, high affinity variants would 366 profit progressively, whereas falling cell surface receptor densities would put the low affinity viruses 367 increasingly at a disadvantage. 368 The forced evolution trials performed with rBCoV-HE-F 211 A were restricted in course and outcome by 369 design, because full reversion would require simultaneous mutation of two adjacent nucleotides. 370 Moreover, the crucial role of the Phe 211 in ligand binding (sFig. 1) obviates conservative substitutions 371 17 . Although rBCoV-HE A211V variants did emerge in two separate experiments, this mutation only 372 marginally increases HE RBS affinity and sialate-O-acetylesterase activity. 373 In contrast to the HE-Phe 211 Ala mutation, the deleterious effect of N-glycosylation at HE-Asn 114 can be 374 reversed, completely or partially, through various single-nucleotide substitutions in codons 114 and 375 116 and would therefore more readily allow for compensatory mutations also in HE. Indeed, serial 376 passage of the rBCoV-HE-Thr 114 Asn resulted in a succession of mutations alternatingly in HE and S. The 377 order of appearance of these mutations and their effect on protein function indicated that they were 378 not fixed to merely restore the balance between attachment and catalysis-driven virion elution. The Thr 83 Asn and Leu 89 Pro), but with propagation thus recovered, derivatives rapidly emerged with 381 increased HE lectin and esterase activity through a Ser 116 Phe mutation. Apparently, this created an 382 HE-S disbalance that in turn favored the selection of viruses with revertant mutations in S that raised 383 S RBS affinity again to wildtype (Thr 83 \u2192 Ile \u2192 Thr; Leu 89 \u2192 Pro \u2192 Leu) or near wildtype levels (Thr 83 \u2192 Ile 384 \u2192 Ser; Leu 89 \u2192 Pro\u2192 Thr/Ser). Conjointly, our findings indicate that through an initial sharp reduction in 385 overall avidity, compensatory to loss of HE function, virus particles regained the capacity of eluding 386 non-productive attachment to decoy receptors, but at a fitness penalty. The decrease in S RBS affinity 387 would predictably lower the specific infectivity of virus particles through a decrease in productive host 388 cell attachment. The rapid selection of the HE-Ser 116 Phe mutation in a low-affinity S background can 389 thus be understood to have increased virion avidity, albeit through HE and rather than through S. HE 390 does have a dual function after all and in influenza viruses C and D as well as in murine coronavirus-1, 391 it is a receptor-binding protein first and foremost 22,35,53-56 . Of note, the partial Ser 116 Phe reversion of 392 HE consistently seen in multiple independent experiments, suggests that a return to (near) wildtype 393 lectin and esterase activity along with a low affinity S would have tipped the scale too much towards 394",
