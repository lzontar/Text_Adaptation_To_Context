It is of serious concern and extreme challenge not only to the health personnel but also to the countries for containment. The causative organism is SARS-CoV-2, RNA virus of subgenus Sarbecovirus, similar to the SARS virus, and seventh member of the human coronavirus family responsible for this zoonotic infection. It binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE-2) receptor and causes constitutional and respiratory symptoms. The major mode of transmission is human to human and the median incubation period is 4 days. The most common symptom as studied from various cohorts of COVID-19 patients are fever (83-98%) followed by fatigue (70%) and dry cough (59%); gastrointestinal symptoms are relatively uncommon differentiating it from SARS and MERS. Most of the SAR-CoV-2 infection are mild (80%) with a usual recovery period of 2 weeks. COVID-19 commonly affects males in the middle age and elderly age group, with highest case fatality (8-15%) among those aged >80 years. The disease begins with fever, dry cough, fatigue and myalgia progressing to dyspnoea and ARDS over 6 and 8 days post exposure, respectively. Underlying co-morbidities increase mortality in COVID-19. Poor prognostic factors are elderly, co-morbidities, severe lymphopaenia, high CRP and D-dimer >1 \u03bcg/L. The overall mortality rate ranges from 1.5 to 3.6%. COVID-19 has to be differen-55 tiated from other viral and bacterial pneumonias as they are more common among healthy adults. Despite constant and vigorous efforts by researchers and health agencies, we are far from containment, cure or prevention by vaccine; hence right information and stringent prevention and control measures are the only weapon in the armoury to combat the ongoing infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The world is yet again facing a global pandemic of zoonotic origin after the 2002 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) era. Renowned microbiologists Macfarlane Burnet and David White predicted in 1972 that \"the most likely forecast about the future of infectious diseases is that it will be very dull.\" They further admitted that there was always a risk of \"some wholly unexpected emergence of a new and dangerous infectious disease\" (Burnet and White 1972) . True to their prediction, in December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, linked to the local seafood market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China heralded the now global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, previous called the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) (Wuhan Municipal Health Commission 2019). It was in February 2020 the Director-General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, christened it as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (World Health Organization 2020a). It was isolated from the human airway epithelial cells, and after the viral genomic sequencing was identified as the seventh member of the betacoronavirus family infecting humans, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, order nidovirales and subgenus Sarbecovirus similar to the SARS virus but different clade with profound similarity to bat coronaviruses (Tan et al. 2020) . It is a non-segmented, positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus. After the initial identification of the local cluster of cases in Wuhan, the epidemic peaked in China between late January and early February (WHO 2020a). The virus simultaneously spread rapidly worldwide by community transmission in Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea and superspreading events affecting many nations across the globe causing the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30th 2020 and a global pandemic on 12th March 2020 (WHO 2020b) . Understanding of the disease is ever evolving since its emergence. SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen with a naughty mix of virulence and contagiousness combined with human-animal interaction, urban crowding, global trade and tourism has made it a potential threat to mankind worldwide.

Thus, the major mode of transmission is via airborne large droplets with a risk limited to~6 ft from the patient (del Rio and Malani 2020). Due to large droplets borne transmission, infection can be prevented from spreading by using surgical face masks and airborne precautions.
