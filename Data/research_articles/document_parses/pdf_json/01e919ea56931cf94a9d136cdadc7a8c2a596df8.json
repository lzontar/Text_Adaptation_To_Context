We sought to quantify survival of pregnant and postpartum women necessitating ECMO in a contemporary cohort at a single tertiary institution. STUDY DESIGN: All women of reproductive age (14e44 years), who underwent ECMO at our institution between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017, were identified using a query of hospital encounters for ECMO-related CPT codes. We manually reviewed all charts of women of reproductive age; women who were pregnant or <6 weeks postpartum at the time of ECMO initiation were included. Clinical characteristics and maternal and fetal outcomes are described. RESULTS: In this study, 54 women of reproductive age underwent ECMO for cardiopulmonary failure. Of those, 9 (17%) were pregnant or <6 weeks postpartum at the time of ECMO initiation: 4 antepartum, 1 intraoperative at the time of cesarean delivery, and 4 postpartum (including 2 in whom ECMO was initiated on postpartum day 0 or 1). Overall, maternal survival was 33%. The median maternal age was 24 years (range 19e39 years); most women were nonsmokers without underlying medical comorbidities. The most common indication for ECMO use in pregnant and postpartum women was acute respiratory distress syndrome, which was present in 7 cases (78%), including 5 cases that were due to infectious etiologies and 2 cases that were attributed to preeclampsia. The median number of days on ECMO was 6 (range 1e14). There were no cases of obstetric hemorrhage. Venovenous ECMO was utilized in all but 1 case, in which emergent attempted venoarterial ECMO was unsuccessful in resuscitating a postpartum patient with cardiac arrest and a massive pulmonary embolism. A total of 4 women were initiated on ECMO during pregnancy: their gestational ages at ECMO initiation were 21, 22, 29, and 30 weeks; maternal survival was 50%, and fetal mortality was 50%. A case of ECMO initiated during cesarean section at 29 weeks' gestation resulted in both maternal and fetal survival. Among 4 mothers with ECMO initiation after childbirth, none survived. Finally, we found a tendency toward survival in those patients for whom ECMO was initiated soon after mechanical ventilation, earlier in the disease process. In contrast, in this study, 23 of 45 women of reproductive age (51%) who were not pregnant but underwent ECMO survived. CONCLUSION: When ECMO was initiated during pregnancy or during childbirth, 60% of mothers and fetuses survived, supporting current use of ECMO as a salvage therapy in pregnant and intrapartum women. In this generally young and healthy population, ECMO has the potential to increase the survival rates of both mother and fetus and should be considered a salvage therapy for peripartum women with reversible forms of cardiorespiratory failure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Extracorporeal life support was first introduced as a life-saving therapy in the 1970s. After its debut, randomized controlled trials initially showed benefit only in neonates, with survival approaching 80% in this population, compared with 10% to 30% of adults receiving therapy. However, technological improvements, including heparin coating of equipment in the years 1990 to 2000, led to improved outcomes in adults, and currently, survival rates in adults are 50% to 70%. 1, 2 Modern extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is utilized in many tertiary care centers across the United States and other developed countries as a life-saving technology for severe, reversible cardiopulmonary failure. According to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO), the past decade has seen an increase in ECMO use in adults by more than 10-fold, and rates of use continue to rise. 3, 4 Use of ECMO in adults worldwide in 2019 exceeded 12,000 cases, an increase of 30% from the previous year. 5 Despite its widespread use, there are limited data regarding the safety and efficacy of ECMO when used in pregnant and postpartum patients. We reviewed the literature and estimated that fewer than 150 cases of ECMO use during pregnancy and the postpartum period have been published. The largest case series we are aware of consists of 18 women (4 pregnant and 14 postpartum) 6 ; many publications are single case reports. 6e19 Although the ELSO closely monitors outcomes and complication rates among individuals receiving ECMO, they do not track pregnancy or postpartum status. 1 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to add to the literature by providing additional cases of ECMO use in obstetric patients to further support claims of safety and efficacy when used in pregnant and postpartum women. Original Research and to identify patients with a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy of at least 6 weeks' gestation at the time of ECMO initiation and up to 6 weeks postpartum. Clinical characteristics and maternal and/or fetal outcomes were abstracted via individual chart review. Our primary outcome of interest was maternal survival. The secondary outcome of interest was fetal survival if the mother was pregnant at the time of ECMO initiation. Additional characteristics of interest included indication for ECMO, type of ECMO circuit (venovenous or venoarterial), clinical parameters prompting providers to initiate mechanical ventilation and ECMO, length of time on ECMO, and time on mechanical ventilation before ECMO cannulation. Obstetric characteristics were also collected, including gestational age, mode and timing of delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage.

Moreover, Original Research none of the pregnant women who had complicated pregnancies owing to severe maternal illness requiring ECMO during pregnancy or intrapartum delivered at term. Specifically, rates of spontaneous preterm labor and nonreassuring fetal status were high. Despite a relative paucity of data in the obstetric population and the low maternal survival rate in this cohort, ECMO remains an attractive life-saving therapy for severe, reversible cardiopulmonary failure. Despite the full anticoagulation strategies required during ECMO, none of the antepartum or postpartum cases were complicated by obstetric hemorrhage. Although pregnant and postpartum women have unique risks for both infectious and noninfectious respiratory failure, most women in this study were young and lacked extensive medical comorbidities. Our case of emergent intrapartum ECMO initiation due to flash pulmonary edema and refractory hypoxemia and hypercarbia secondary to preeclampsia with severe features exemplifies a clinical scenario unique to pregnancy and illustrates a situation where tertiary care resources can be mobilized in nontraditional ways to meet acute patient needs. Furthermore, several women in our case series underwent ECMO initiation after only a short period of mechanical ventilation. There was a tendency toward survival in those patients for whom ECMO was initiated soon after mechanical ventilation, earlier in the disease process.

We posit that the differences we found in maternal outcomes in our cohort of women who received ECMO may reflect the unbiased reporting of all cases at our institution.

This is not unexpected, as the gravid uterus increases intraabdominal pressure, displaces the diaphragm upward, and reduces chest wall compliance. 31 In addition to higher peak airway pressures required in pregnancy, accepted lung protective ventilatory strategies in ARDS, particularly permissive hypercapnia and associated respiratory acidosis, are at odds with fetal well-being and survival.
