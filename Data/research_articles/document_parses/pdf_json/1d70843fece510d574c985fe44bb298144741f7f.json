Transgenic mice that express a human version of the protein hACE2 (originally developed to study SARS), ferrets, and non-human primates (NHP) appear to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [2] [3] [4] [5] ; however, there are several problems associated with each of these animal models. hACE2 mice yield severe lung and brain infections with 100% mortality by day six postinfection with SARS-CoV virus but show very mild lung pathology and clinical phenotypes upon infection [3, 6] . Ferrets, which have similar lung physiology to humans, show low pathogenicity for coronaviruses. NHP models have the advantage of immunological relatedness to the human immune system, but they are difficult and expensive to work with and present inconsistent clinical disease.",

            "text": "In another study that leverages current understanding of the molecular organogenesis within lungs, Mori et al. employed a conditional blastocyst complementation approach to transplant a humanized lung and trachea in mice and other animal models [8] . They transplanted the pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into the blastocyst of the severely genetically defective mutant mice. In the defective recipient mice embryos, PSCs were observed to take over the lung development process which would have otherwise resulted in fetal death due to defective lung agenesis. The team used Ctnnb1cnull and Fgfr2cnull mutant mice where the former gene specifies, and the later gene expands, the early respiratory endodermal progenitor cells. Lung organogenesis initiates when trachea and lung progenitor are collectively specified in the foregut endoderm by Wnt-\u03b2-catenin (Ctnnb1) activation. \u03b2-catenin is either at or near the top of the genetic hierarchy that executes the lung development program. It promotes respiratory progenitor characteristics both during lung initiation in the fetal lung and in stem cell maintenance in the adult lung. It is important to note that this pathway is a major regulator but not the sole player. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2), the activation failure of which results not only in pulmonary agenesis but also impaired trophoblast formation and multiple defects such as limb agenesis during the later stages of development. To address this issue, Mori et al. applied a targeted gene-deletion strategy to conditionally delete Fgfr2 in the foregut endoderm immediately before the onset of lung organogenesis, which selectively affects the lung formation without affecting the limb formation. Although the PSCs (expressing GFP driven by lung-specific NKX2-1 promoter) complemented the defective Fgfr2 and formed the lobation or branching morphogenesis, it was unable to form the distal saccules for gas exchange and the pups died at birth. Mori et al. addressed this issue by using an a2i/VPA/LIFtreated PSC expressing GFP under CAG promoter and expressing high stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 in order to maintain the PSC's pluripotency. a2i/VPA/LIF is a cocktail of stem cell culture medium which meditates self-renewal and enhanced expression of pluripotency-associated proteins (Oct4, Pecam, and Ssea1), epigenetic changes resulting in a more accessible (open) chromatin, and improved chimera formation efficiency [8] . Since respiratory infectious diseases are continuously on the rise, we believe that it is a good time to revisit the ethical considerations of humanizing mice with human organsespecially a mouse with human-like lungs (Figure 1 ). There have been significant advancements made in the stem cell technology and genetic engineering sector that could be utilized for faithful delivery of the human PSCs into the later stages of the mice embryonic development.",
