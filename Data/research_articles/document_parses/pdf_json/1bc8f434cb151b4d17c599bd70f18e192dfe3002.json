            "text": "of December 2019. By 19th June 2020, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 450 686 people and has been reported to infect almost 8 385 440 people worldwide. 3 Pakistan has reported 4944 cases in a single day, taking the toll of total infected cases to 165 062, and 3229 people have lost the battle of life against COVID-19 Figure 1). Another health emergency; Polio is looming as the country is battling against the COVID-19 pandemic. Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease caused by Poliovirus that is a serotype of the specie Enterovirus C belonging to the family Picornaviridae. Poliovirus is a single-stranded RNA virus of about 7500 nucleotides long enclosed in an icosahedral protein capsid of 30 nm in diameter. Horizontal transmission of the virus is mainly through the fecal-oral route. 5,6 To date there are three strains of poliovirus, based on their slight differences in the capsid protein coat; PV-1, PV,2, and PV-3. Since 1988, there has been a 99% reduction in the global occurrence rate of polio infected cases; declining from 350 000 cases to only 175 reported cases in the year 2019. Wild PV-2 and PV-3 have been declared eradicated since last been detected in 1999 and 2012, respectively. However, as of March 2020, wild poliovirus serotype 1 (PV-1) is still concentrated in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 7 Wild type poliovirus has been eradicated by the world as a result of mass vaccination launched by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988 except three countries; Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Pakistan is still struggling against the poliovirus eradication. Since 2015, the Pakistan polio program has performed admirably well bringing 306 cases in 2014 to only 54 cases in 2015, 20 in 2016, declining to an all-time low of eight reported cases in 2017, 12 in 2018 and then surging up to 147 cases in 2019 8,9 (Figure 2). As of June 2020, 51 cases have been reported so far, the environmental samples collected from around the country suggested that 65% of them were positive for poliovirus being highest in Sindh and Balochistan. 10 On 4th June 2020, the deputy commissioner (DC) of Multan issued polio alerts after detecting poliovirus in sewerage water. 11 By 18th June 2020, one polio case has been reported in both Chaman and Upper Dir District of Khyber Pakhtunkhuwa. 12,13 Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, 40 million children in Pakistan have missed the polio vaccination since April when all vaccination programs were suspended.",
