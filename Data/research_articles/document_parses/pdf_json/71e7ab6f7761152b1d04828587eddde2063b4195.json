Nine minutes after, ALS team arrived and confirmed CA, with VF. The victim was defibrillated with a 200 J shock and BLS resumed. When orotracheal intubation was attempted, masseter muscle contraction was noticed, so BLS was discontinued for reevaluation. The rhythm had become a wide QRS tachycardia with pulse and the victim recovered spontaneous breathing. Partial consciousness was recovered (Glasgow Coma Score: 11). On physical examination blood pressure was 133/62 mmHg, heart rate 130 bpm and pulse oximetry 97%. The patient was transferred to an emergency department. Half an hour later, as he recovered consciousness fully, he complained of chest pain. The ECG showed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 75, right bundle branch block and ST segment depression in in leads V4 to V6. Laboratorial tests showed cardiac troponine I 0.78 ng/ml. A coronary angiography performed urgently, disclosed significant left main plus three vessel -coronary artery disease. Left anterior descending artery (LAD) was occluded, with late retrograde flow. Eighteen hours after the CA, a quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting operation was undertaken. During surgery, a fresh thrombus was removed from the proximal LAD.

INTRODUCTION. During volume controlled ventilation (VCV), several factors can modify the volume (VT) really delivered to the patient's lung, such as ambient pressure and temperature, water content, and the amount of compressed gas in the tubings.

The Ventilator Bundle-elevation of the head of the bed, daily sedation vacations, peptic ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis-has been promoted by the IHI as ''a series of interventions that, when implemented together, will achieve significantly better outcomes than when implemented individually.'' However, rigorous evidence for the bundle approach is weak. In May 2006, the Welsh Critical Care Improvement Programme (WCCIP) launched implementation of care bundles at the national level. By August 2006, the Ventilator Bundle had not only been introduced in all 14 critical care sites in Wales, but WCCIPmonitored compliance rates indicated national compliance of over 95%. To date, no evaluation of patient outcomes has been attempted. Opportunistically, 13 critical care units from 12 of the 14 sites participate in the Case Mix Programme, the national comparative audit of critical care, enabling a comparison of outcomes before and after implementation and achieving high compliance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "METHODS.

Despite widespread implementation and high levels of compliance across Wales, no significant impact on patient outcomes was identified.

While the failure to identify any demonstrable effect on patient outcomes in our study may disappoint those that support the bundle approach to quality improvement, it should not detract from the importance of following current best practice in the management of these patients. INTRODUCTION. Unintended tube removals (UTR) are frequently observed adverse events in ICUs and potentially involving serious complications.

A conditional logistic regression stratified on length of stay was used to identify risk factors of tube removals. Segmented linear regression analysis was conducted to test for the effect of the improvement interventions. INTRODUCTION. NICCIMS is a prospective regional audit study designed to analyse occurrence of adverse events in intensive care units (ICUs). An anonymous database has been installed in seven ICUs since September 2007 facilitating central analysis of all reported incidents in N.Ireland.

There appears to be more adverse events reported related to tracheostomies from the latter 2 units. All units claimed to have written policies related to central venous catheters, but in 2 units there was disagreement between staff as to the existence of a policy. 57% respondents stated the policy is only followed 'most of the time'.

A wealth of information regarding adverse events has been collected through NICCIMS. The presence of effective policies is likely to reduce the possibility of an incident as it provides staff with an agreed management approach.

Discordance between clinicians and nursing staff regarding the existence of policies suggest an ineffective policy as staff are unaware of it, and therefore are highly unlikely to achieve the aim of the policy which may give rise to increased adverse events. There is an opportunity for regional policies to be agreed between units to simplify and unify our approach to enhancing safety. Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom (NICE) has expressed concern that ''Clinical audit has a mixed history in the NHS, and for every success story there are just as many projects that have run into the ground without demonstrating any significant contribution to quality of services.''

IMS improved detection of instability as compared to conventional four channel monitoring in a SDU and decreased both the total number of unstable patients and the instability duration. Use of the IMS also increased the probability that MET activation would be called for serious instability. Further study will determine the relationship between improved detection and treatment approaches for unstable patients. METHODS. In a 10-bed polyvalent ICU located in a 1400 bedded community and teaching hospital a PIMS (Centricity Critical Care Clinisoft; G.E. healthcare) was introduced on June 1st 2005. Before the implementation of the PIMS fluid and medication orders were written by hand by the physicians on a daily medication chart. After the implementation, drug prescriptions were entered via the keyboard. The system was developed to supply pre-defined fluids and medication protocols, as well as default medication dosages and drug interaction warnings.To compare the frequency of medication errors before and after the implementation of the PIMS, data of two periods of 15 days each (30 to 15 days before and 60 to 75 days after) were prospectively collected and analyzed. For each period, 150 patient/days were considered. No one of the staff members, but the ICU director, was made aware of the ongoing study. Patients charts were daily revised between 7.00 and 8.00 AM by two independent physicians, not directly involved in patients care. Fluids and medication orders were revised looking for medication errors. The ICU director was immediately notified about any identified error, to allow immediate correction during the ward round. Errors were classified as Type 1 (clinically relevant and potentially dangerous) or Type 2 (registration errors without clinical relevance). CONCLUSION. the implementation of a PIMS in ICU was followed by a highly significant reduction in medication errors. Although PIMS are expensive, they may lead to a dramatic amelioration in the quality of care. The economic impact of the reduction in medication errors needs to be further investigated.

Immediate tracheal extubation of selected adult patients after liver transplantation (LT) is common practice. Historically, most of liver transplant patients have been extubated, within 10-12 h following surgery in our hospital. Today, new drugs and techniques, advanced monitoring and improved perioperative patient care contribute to rapid and uneventful recovery from surgery, fewer postoperative complications, shorter hospitalization, increased patient satisfaction and a better outcome. Recently, we tried to extubate aggressively in the operating room (OR) rather than in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Induced mild hypothermia (IMH) has improved neurological outcome in patients after cardiac arrest. However, the prediction of outcome in the first days remains challenging. After stopping active cooling, there is a wide variation in normalization of temperature. Some patients must be actively rewarmed because of slow spontaneous rewarming, probably due to cerebral injury. Rapid normalization of temperature after stopping active cooling might reflect an intact brain stem function.

Patients whose condition necessitated premature stopping of IMH were excluded. Patients were divided into two groups according to the mode of rewarming: active or passive. Neurological outcome was determined according to the Glasgow Outcome Scores at ICU and hospital discharge (GOSic and GOShp).

Unfortunately, the difference did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the small number of patients. [1] . Although a short time to reach target temperature (33 0C) is likely to be an essential aspect of MH, the HACA trial showed survival benefit even when target temperature of 33 0C was reached beyond 12 h after cardiac arrest [2] .

Tight control of blood glucose is considered important, although difficult to perform in routine care. Moreover, concerns remain about the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, with reported rates up to 20% and the increased nurse workload due to frequent check of the blood glucose level imposed by usual protocols for achieving tight glycaemic control with hourly measurements when the blood glucose target is not reached. We demonstrated elsewhere that the software CGAO was more effective for achieving tight glycemic control than a conventional method based on daily medical prescriptions. The software CGAO does not only recommend an insulin rate but also the time for the next control of the blood glucose level with an interval between 30 min to 4 h.

Increased blood glucose levels are frequently observed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures, with or without diabetes. Intensive insulin therapy decreases mortality, length of hospitalization and number of complications as it has been shown in recently published studies. Many protocols have been developed to implement tight glycaemic control. The aim of this study was to compare blood glucose control by the automated model predictive algorithm with variable sampling interval (eMPC2) with a routine glucose management protocol (RP) in the peri-and postoperative period in cardiac surgery patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "Sixty patients were included in this study (41 men, 19 women, mean age 69 \u00b1 7, BMI 27.9 \u00b1 2.6 kg/m 2 ).

All patients underwent an elective cardiac surgery procedure and were treated from the beginning of the surgery with a continuous insulin infusion to maintain glycaemia in a target range of 4.4-6.1 mmol/l. 30 patients were randomized for treatment using the eMPC algorithm and 30 patients for routine protocol management. Blood glucose was measured in 1-to 4-h intervals as requested by each algorithm during surgery and postoperatively. Statistical analysis -the patients from different groups were compared using ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak test, Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. The significance level was set at p = 0.05. CONCLUSION. eMPC algorithm is comparably safe as compared to a routine glucose management protocol with respect to hypoglycaemia. The results of our study suggest that eMPC algorithm is more effective in maintaining euglycaemia in peri-and postoperative periods in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedure. CONCLUSION. The vast majority of UK ICUs have a written policy in place for implementing strict glucose control, and for most the upper limit of the blood glucose target range is B7 mmol/L.

Thrombocytopenia is a common complication of hematologic malignancies, but it also accompanies other conditions, e.g. major blood loss.

Insulin is regularly applied to lower elevated serum potassium levels. This action of insulin is effected by increasing the cellular uptake of potassium. Whether the potassium lowering effect of insulin is also effected by changes in renal potassium secretion is unclear. Since the therapeutic goal in hyperkalemia is to remove potassium from the body, it is of relevance if insulin inhibits renal potassium excretion. Most studies in human volunteers have suggested that insulin has an antikaliuretic effect [1] . These studies are however hampered by insufficient control of decreased serum potassium levels. In our ICUs we have a computer supported system called GRIP-II (Glucose and potassium Regulation Intensive care Patients) that strictly regulates potassium levels with periodic adjustments of continuous potassium infusion. Such a form of regulation approaches potassium clamping. In this setting we studied the effect of insulin and potassium on renal potassium excretion.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1941, "end": 1944, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "In a 12-bed surgical ICU unit in a tertiary teaching hospital we routinely collected 24-h urine samples that were analyzed for potassium concentration.

INTRODUCTION. Burn patients often receive far more resuscitation fluid than predicted by usual formula. Even few of them need support with vasopressor agents to achieve classic resuscitation end points (urinary output, mean arterial pressure). These variations are related with negative consequences described in the literature such as abdominal compartmental syndrome and progression of burn necrosis. Some of the factors related with the increased requirements of fluids are known (electrical buns, inhalational injury). In cases where these circumstances do not concur other factors are unknown. Adrenal failure is common in critically ill conditions.

Our goal was to analyze the impact on mortality in a third level hospital of the educational campaign based on different bundles of resuscitation within the first 6 and 24 h. RESULTS. Only two predictor goals reached the statistic signification when we compared the outcomes of the different fases: glucemia control during the first and second fase (p = 0,023) and during the second and third fase (p = 0,01), and the protective ventilation durind the second and third fase (p = 0,01).

Alcohol intoxication (methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol) may result in metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, increased serum osmolal gap, and neurologic abnormalities ranging from drunkenness to coma, and death. The mortality and morbidity rates remain very high despite intensive care therapy. The toxicity of methanol and ethylene glycol is clearly correlated to the degree of metabolic acidosis.

From 2004 to 2007, the incidence of ICU admissions increased from 14% to 54% (p \\ 0.05). A high prevalence of co-morbidities was observed: hypertension (83%), diabetes (37%) and coronary artery disease (27%). The four main reasons for ICU admission were: acute respiratory failure (42 %), acute circulatory failure (29%), coma (9%) and acute renal failure (8%). Sepsis was present at admission in 76% and associated with pulmonary infection in 48 % and with urinary infection in 28%. The three main causes of acute respiratory failure were: bacterial pneumonia (34%), pneumocystis pneumonia (32%) and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (24%). Fifty percent of the micro-organisms isolated in bacterial pneumonias were resistant to empirical antibiotherapy. Seventy three percent of the patients suffering from respiratory failure required mechanical ventilation. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) was used initially in 46% of the patients (n = 13). In 7/13 patients NIV failed and patients required intubation. Eighty eight percent of the patients admitted for acute circulatory failure (n = 26) suffered from septic shock. Pyelonephritis and intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnosed respectively in 43 and 26%. Acute renal failure was present at admission and/or during ICU stay in 67% of the cases. Acute renal failure needed renal replacement therapy in 70% of them. Median ICU and hospital length of stay were respectively 5 and 20 days. ICU and hospital mortality was 19 and 24%.

The importance of pharmacogenetics in the metabolism of drugs in critically ill patients is untested. Three cytochrome P450 enzymes and their numerous isoenzymes account for over 60% of all drug metabolism. The CYP450 enzymes have a number of functional alleles with varying clinical significance. Midazolam is an established in-vivo probe of cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) activity in healthy volunteers. This study investigates whether a single plasma midazolam concentration acts as an accurate predictor of total midazolam clearance in critically ill patients with a view to more complex in-vivo studies of the effects of critical illness on the metabolic activity of CYP3A.METHODS.Patients admitted to the adult intensive care unit were excluded if they had; acute or chronic liver failure, received benzodiazepines in the past 24 h or were pregnant. I.V. Midazolam (1 mg) was given at time 0 and serum was collected at5,15,30,60,120,180,240,300,360  and 480 mins. Serum midazolam concentration was determined by mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). Area under the curve (trapezoid rule) was correlated (Spearman rank) to serum 4 h midazolam concentration. RESULTS. 20 patients (13 male). Age 75 (50-87). Mean APACHE 18. 4 h midazolam correlated with AUC; r = 0.956, p \\ 0.0001 (graph).CONCLUSION. Single point determination of midazolam concentration four h after administration accurately predicts the metabolic rate of midazolam metabolism in critically ill patients.

Sepsis is the most common disease associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). To test the hypothesis that DIC diagnosed by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) DIC scoring system constitutes a dependent continuum to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) overt DIC in patients with sepsis, we conducted a retrospective study.METHODS. The databases from two prospective, multicenter clinical investigations were analyzed. The inclusion criteria comprised patients with sepsis-related DIC, who met the JAAM DIC criteria.RESULTS. The present study enrolled 166 patients, of whom 67 met the ISTH overt DIC criteria. All patients with sepsis who developed to overt DIC during the study period could be identified by the JAAM DIC diagnostic criteria in the first study. While the overall 28-day mortality was 31.3%, mortality (40.3%, p = 0.0040) and the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (70.1%, p = 0.008) of the patients with overt DIC was approximately one and a half times that of the patients associated with only the JAAM DIC. A stepwise increase in the ISTH DIC scores and the incidence of overt DIC were also observed in accordance with the increase in the JAAM DIC scores.CONCLUSION. DIC diagnosed based on the JAAM DIC diagnostic criteria exists in a hierarchical continuum to overt DIC in patients with sepsis, enabling them to receive early treatment.REFERENCE(S). 1.

In sepsis coagulation, inflammation and tissue regeneration are activated aiming to restore homeostasis. Skin is essential barrier in maintaining a stable internal environment. It is not known whether the massive host response in sepsis alters skin collagen synthesis.METHODS.In this prospective observational study experimental blisters were induced on abdominal skin four times: within the first 48 h from the first organ failure, on the fifth day after the first set of blisters and at 3 and 6 months. To evaluate skin collagen synthesis, aminoterminal propeptides of collagens I and III (PINP, PIIINP) were measured from blister fluid. 44 patients with severe sepsis were enrolled. The median age was 63 years (25th-75th percentile 53-71). The median APACHE II score on admission was 26(22-30). 30-day mortality was 25%.15 healthy adults were used as controls.RESULTS. PIIINP and PINP levels in septic patients were lower in comparison with controls ], P \\ 0.001, respectively). In long time survivors PIIINP and PINP levels were increased at 3 and 6 months compared to levels in sepsis.CONCLUSION. Skin collagen synthesis is depressed during severe sepsis and is followed by a compensatory response at 3 and 6 months after the onset of sepsis.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

Horn Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, NetherlandsINTRODUCTION. Induced mild hypothermia (IMH) is a recommended strategy to limit neurological damage after cardiac arrest. Although pre-hospital cooling is not practiced in the Netherlands, patients may arrive in the intensive care unit (ICU) with spontaneous hypothermia. It is known that patients with spontaneous hypothermia due to trauma or sepsis have a higher mortality rate. The aim of the current study was to examine if admission temperature of patients after cardiac arrest is related to neurological outcome.METHODS.Consecutive patients resuscitated for cardiac arrest and treated with IMH in our ICU between January 2006 and January 2008 were eligible for this retrospective study. Patients were excluded if cardiac arrest was a result of trauma, intracranial bleeding or drowning. To evaluate the neurological outcome, the ICU and hospital Glasgow Outcome Scores (GOSic and GOShp) were retrieved A GOS of 1-3 was defined as poor, and 4-5 as good neurological outcome. Patients were divided according to their admission temperature into a spontaneous hypothermia group (\\ 35.1\u00b0C) and a normothermia group (C 35.1\u00b0C). The groups were compared by means of Pearson's X 2 and relative risk (RR). A P \\ 0.05 was considered statistical significant.RESULTS. From a total of 215 patients treated with IMH, 102 patients were excluded. The remaining 113 had a median admission temperature of 35.1\u00b0C (32-38\u00b0C). Spontaneous hypothermic patients had a worse outcome (table). The RR for good neurological outcome CONCLUSION. Patients resuscitated for cardiac arrest arriving in the ICU with spontaneous hypothermia have a worse neurological outcome than normothermic patients. THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AFTER CARDIAC ARREST V.

Koger 1 1 Anaesthesiology and Postoperative Intensive Care, 2 Cardiac Intensive Care, North-Estonia Regional Hospital, Tallinn, EstoniaINTRODUCTION.In 2007 mild therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was introduced in our hospital. Early and fast cooling after restoration of spontaneous circulation remains a challenge during the first hours after CPR. But no less important during these first hours are the optimal intensive care and timely cardiac interventions to diagnose and to treat (PTCA,CABG etc.) the reason of cardiac arrest (CA). An analysis was made to evaluate our first year results and the protocol we had used.METHODS.A retrospective cohort study of 20 TH patients between February 2006 and January 2008 . Different cooling methods were combined: an external cooling technique with ice-cold bags, intravenous cold saline infusion and intravascular cooling catheter method (Alsius Coolgard) were used depending in wich department the patient first arrived and if any other invasive procedure was done during the first hours post CPR. Intravascular cooling, with target temperature 32-33 degrees Celsius for a period of up to 24 h was started in the intensive care unit (ICU). Additionally to the hospital mortality and neurological outcome we studied also the rate of hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hemodynamic instability, arrhythmias and bleeding disorders during the period of TH. PEA-4.Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed 17/20. Mean time of the transportation to the hospital was 48 (0-114) min, to the ICU 83 (0-175) min and cooling with intravascular cooling catheter was started 205 (75-305) min after CA. During the cooling period an insulin infusion was used 13/20; hypokalemia (K \\ 3,5 mmol/l) was seen 9/20, additional antiarrhythmic therapy was used 9/20, vasoactive drugs or inotropes were infused 13/20 cases. Muscle relaxants to avoid shivering were used 16/20. there were diagnosed pneumonia 4/20, bleeding disorders 3/20.Percutaneous coronary angiography was done to the 12/20 patients. 4 patients were treated with PTCA and 2 patients with CABG. Mortality of our patients was 50 % (10/20) but in the subgroup of patients having a PCI it was 42% (5/12). There was a good neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Score 1-2) 7 days after CA in the survival group.CONCLUSION.Our first year experience of TH is comparable with results published in literature. It is important to start with cooling as fast as possible and to build up the inhospital treatment algorithms for intensive care and PCI after CA.HYPOTHERMIA AFTER CPR ARE WE DOING IT RIGHT?H. I. G.

According with previous studies, protective hypothermia (PH) seems to improve neurological outcome and long-term mortality after ventricular fibrillation (VF). It seems to be useful when another rythm is present.METHODS.We analyzed retrospectively every patient admitted at a 22-beds medical ICU after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation between January 2000 and December 2007. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with mortality and neurological outcome.RESULTS. 84 patients were included. 59.5% were males. The mean age was 64 years. Because of the characteristics of our ICU, the most frequent cause of cardiac arrest (CA) (44%) was a respiratory failure. 18 patients (21.4%) suffered the CA in the out-of-hospital area. Between in-hospital CA, 25 took place in the Emergency Room, 16 in the ICU, and 25 in other hospital areas. 49 patients (58.3%) presented asistolia as the first rythm, 20 (23.8%) electromechanical dissociation and 15 (17.9%) ventricular fibrillation. 27 patients (32%) received PH treatment. ICU mortality was 60.7% and hospital mortality 73.8%. Among patients who were treated with PH, the ICU mortality was as high as 74%. The only factor associated with mortality in ICU was the total time (in minutes) of CPR (OR 1.1, p = 0.01), whereas ICU mortality between patients who received PH was associated with the delay (in hours) to reach \\ 34\u00b0C (OR 0.6, p = 0.03). In-hospital mortality in the total sample was associated with the use of PH (OR 4.4, p = 0.03) and with APACHE II score at admission (OR 1.7, p = 0.09) while, among patients who received PH, in-hospital mortality was only associated with the delay in receiving CPR. The only factor associated with good neurological outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of[4][5] was the treatment with PH (OR 0.2, p = 0.08).CONCLUSION. In our study, PH was associated with better neurological outcomes. It was associated with a mild increase in mortality, probably caused by the previous patients features. Its benefits in CA, wich has poor neurologic outcomes between survivors, have to be confirmed in larger prospective studies.REFERENCE(S). 1. Bernard SA et al.

Antonelli 1 1 Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, 2 Cardiovascular Sciences, Catholic University School of Medicine, Rome, Italy INTRODUCTION. Purpose of the study. To identify possible predictors for the outcome (fail/pass/instructor potential) of the candidates (doctors/nurses) participating to the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Advanced Life Support (ALS) provider course(1). Type of study: observational cohort study. Setting: University Teaching/Training Centre METHODS. At the end of the ERC ALS course candidates were tested on their practical ability to manage a simulated standardised cardiac arrest testing scenario as team leaders. Candidate knowledge was evaluated immediately before and after the course using a standardised 120-item multiple-choice quiz (MCQ)(2). Candidate demographic and professional data as well as the pre-course MCQ scores were analysed as predictors of the course outcome (Fail/Pass/Pass with Instructor Potential [IP]) using Chi and Mann-Whitney tests.RESULTS.Three-hundred and six candidates (58.8% female) were included. Nine (2.9%) of them did not pass the final test, 267 (87.3 %) passed the final test and 30 (9.8%) were identified as having IP. Failed candidates were older (mean age 40.4 vs. 35 years) had a significantly lower median score at pre-course test (73 vs. 83, p = 0.05), none of them was an instructor in other medical disciplines and none of them worked into an intensive care unit (ICU) (p = 0.03). hose candidates having IP had a significantly higher score at final MCQ (mean 92.5 vs. 89.0, p = 0.01), were more frequently nurses (13.3% vs. 4.3%; p \\ 0.05) and had more frequently a specialty in anaesthesiology, cardiology and emergency medicine (69.2 vs. 46.2; p = 0.03) and more frequently worked in ICU (56.7 vs. 29.9%; p \\ 0.01).CONCLUSION. Conclusions: candidates having a specialty in anaesthesiology, cardiology and emergency medicine and those working in ICU are significantly more likely to pass the ERC ALS provider course and to obtain instructors status. Older age and low scores at precourse MCQ are associated to an increased risk of course failure.REFERENCE(S). 1.

Troponin I (TnI) is a sensitive and specific marker of myocardial injury.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF71": {"text": ". There were 1199 patients admitted to the ER, 20.8% female, 79.2% male, with median age 41y. 93.3% resulted from blunt trauma and the main cause was motor vehicle accident (57.1%), followed by falls (29.2%). Mean RTS was 5.99, 83.1% patients had ISS [ 15 and 77.2% TRISS C 50%. Overall mortality was 28.8%. Most of the patients (51.1%) had positive TnI on admission. Mean value was 0.33 lg/dl (SD = 1.25) and maximum measurement occurred (mean 0.67 lg/dl; SD = 2.43) on the 4th h after-admission. TnI positivity was independently related to trauma severity, ISS (OR 1.02, p = 0.049). When multivariate regression was performed, several variables had independent relation with TnI elevation, namely: thoracic trauma (OR 1.45, p = 0.049), rhabdomyolysis (OR 3.57, p \\ 0.001) and shock (OR 1.92, p = 0.001). TnI positivity was an independent factor for mortality (OR1.559, p = 0.02) after correction for background variables and severity. Only 162 patients had isolated TBI who did not differ from the politrauma population above described. Elevated TnI occurred in 28.1% isolated TBI patients and no statistically significant difference was observed in ICU-stay (7 days vs. 8 days, p = 0.185) or mortality (33.3% vs. 29.9%, p = 0.667), compared with patients with normal TnI values.CONCLUSION.The results suggest that the association between TnI elevation and mortality is dependent on multiple factors, such as the presence of rhabdomyolysis, shock and thoracic trauma. TnI is a valid predictor of mortality in politrauma population. However, this prognostic value was not observed in isolated TBI. Further studies with larger number of TBI patients are needed to allow more accurate conclusions.HYPERTONIC SOLUTIONS EFFECTS ON INTRACRANIAL AND CEREBRAL PERFUSION PRESSURES Y. Polushin 1 , A.

To evaluate differences among different orotracheal tubes regarding its capability to maintain cuff pressure in a normal range between its measurements. METHODS. Prospective and observational study including all patients intubated in six ICU. It was follow up over one week. The cuff pressure was measured with a Mallinckrodt manometer Hi-LoTM. With a target of cuff's pressure 25-30 cm H 2 O. Low cuff pressure was defined as values \\ 20 cm H 2 O. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 11.0. RESULTS. A total of 53 intubated patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit were included. Admission diagnosis was medical in 24 (45.3%), surgical in 22 (41.5%) and trauma in 7 (13.2%). 660 measurements were analyzed. Mallinckrodt Hi-Contour tubes were used in 129 measurements (19.5%), Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo tubes in 180 (27.3%) and Rusch tubes in 351 (53.2%). A higher frequency of measurements with cuff pressure \\ 20 cm H2O in the Mallinckrodt Hi-Contour tube were observed when compared to Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo tube (73.6% vs. 58.3%, p \\ 0.05), and to Rusch tube (73.6% vs. 42.4%, p \\ 0.05). When comparing Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo and Rusch tubes difference was found (58.03% vs. 42.4%, p \\ 0.05). TABLE 1 CUFF PRESSURE AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF OROTRACHEAL TUBES Mallinckrodt Hi-Contour Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo Rusch CONCLUSION. The adequate control of cuff pressure is influenced by the tube choise.

Glucose is routinely monitored and treated with insulin to reduce hyperglycemia. With the availability of advanced point-of-care equipment it is possible to simultaneously determine glucose and lactate in arterial samples taken for glucose control. Glycolysis converts glucose into pyruvate, and pyruvate can be converted into lactate. Thus changes in glucose levels can affect lactate levels. The relation between glucose and lactate has not been studied in detail. Since lactate is of prognostic importance in several classes of critically ill patients, distinguishing a relation with glucose levels may be of relevance. We evaluated the relation of lactate with glucose in a cohort of patients admitted to the ICU after open heart surgery.CONCLUSION. Lactate levels are positively related with glucose levels after open heart surgery. This may result from a direct metabolic relation between glucose and lactate or it may result from an association between hyperglycemia and impaired hemodynamics.THE CGAO SOFTWARE IMPROVES GLYCAEMIC CONTROL IN INTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS WITHOUT INCREASING THE INCIDENCE OF SEVERE HYPOGLYCAEMIA NOR THE NURSE WORKLOAD O.

We performed a multicenter, prospective, cohort study. End stage renal disease, and decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments were exclusion criteria. ARF was defined according to the RIFLE class F criteria. Patients with ARF were matched to controls by age, SAPS II, Mc Cabe class, admission category, center and period of inclusion. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between ARF and ICU mortality. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).RESULTS.A total of 7142 patients were analyzed. ARF occurred in 2247 (31.5%) patients, of whom 382 (17%) received RRT. Crude ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients with than in those without ARF (31.6% vs. 10.2%, p \\ 0.0001). After matching and controlling for confounding factors, ARF remained associated with increased mortality (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.57-2.26, p \\ 0,0001). This excess in mortality was observed both for ARF without RRT (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.44-2.21, p \\ 0,0001) and for ARF with RRT (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.50-3.25, p \\ 0,0001).CONCLUSION. ARF is an independent risk factor for ICU mortality.

Early goal direct therapy (EGDT) has been shown safe and efficacious for patients with renal failure (ARF) resulting in reduction of both morbidity and mortality. This protocol includes resuscitation to goals of central venous pressure (CVP) between 8 and 10, mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 65 and 90 mmHg and central venous oximetry (ScvO2) greater than 70%. Regarding ScvO2, there is no study showing that it accurately reflects mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) during renal replacement therapy. Of particular interest are the possible effects of blood flow rate and dialysate and replacement solution flow rate during dialysis in monitoring SvO2. The aim of this study is to compare simultaneous measurements of SvO2 and SvcO2 obtained from distal ports of pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC)and dialysis catheter in a patient with septic shock and ARF during hemodiafiltration.METHODS.It was a prospective clinical trial comparing individual oxygen saturation value as wel as the trend of values from de superior vena cava obtained from dialysis catheter and from artery pulmonar obtained from PAC during hemodiafiltration.RESULTS. Fifteen patients were evaluated during hemodiafiltration, 120 paired measurements of SvO2 and SvCO2 were collected.All the patients were on mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy. Mean Apache was 18. Mortality was 66%. The mean blood flow rate was 152 ml/min, the mean dialysate rate was 1759 ml/h and the mean replacement solution rate was 500 ml/min.The mean value of SvO2 was 78,6 \u00b1 1,2 and SvO2c was 79,4 \u00b1 1,1(p = 0,003). Regression analysis for the pooled measurements of SvCO2 and SvO2 showed a correlation R 0,52. In contrast, correlations between changes over time of SvO2 and SvCO2 values were clinically acceptable R = 0,712.CONCLUSION. In this sample of patients, exact numeric values of SvO2 and SvCO2 during hemodiafiltration are not equivalent.However for clinical purposes, the trend of SvCO2 may be substituted for the trend of SvO2. A clinical trial using a dialysis catheter with continuous measurement of SvCO2 during hemodiafiltration of acute renal failure patients with severe sepsis and septic shock is still lacking.ENDOTHELIN ANTAGONISM REVERSES PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW REDIS-TRIBUTION INDUCED BY INHALED NITRIC OXIDE S.

Pulmonary blood flow redistribution induced by inhaled nitric oxide (INO) can improve oxygenation. We previously hypothesized that this may be a composite effect of vasoconstriction in poorly ventilated lung units and vasodilation in well-aerated areas of the lung", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF144": {"text": ". INO tended to improve oxygenation from 223 \u00b1 85 mmHg during lung injury, to 316 \u00b1 70 mmHg (p = 0.07). Oxygenation deteriorated again to 181 \u00b1 38 mmHg (p = 0.01) similar to pre INO levels by the subsequent infusion of Tezosentan. Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased with lung injury from 19 \u00b1 1.7 mmHg to 38 \u00b1 6 mmHg (p = 0.01), and decreased with INO to 29 \u00b1 5 mmHg. The addition of Tezosentan led mean pulmonary artery pressure to 24 \u00b1 4 mmHg. SPECT data demonstrated that pulmonary blood flow redistribution induced by INO was abolished after 45 min of Tezosentan infusion. (Gravitational plane p \\ 0.001; Horizontal plane p \\ 0.001). Pulmonary blood flow shifts were more accentuated in the dependent to non-dependent direction than in the horizontal plane.CONCLUSION. Our findings further support the hypothesis, that a vasoconstrictive ET-1 mechanism may have an important role in the oxygenation response to INO. We conclude that the mechanism of action of INO in this acute lung injury model consists of two distinct mechanisms, one being vasodilation by INO in ventilated lung regions, the other being vasoconstriction mediated by ET-1 in non-ventilated regions.REFERENCE(S). 1.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is predicted to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020. Approximately 125,000 people die yearly from acute exacerbations of the disease. Once intubation and mechanical ventilation become necessary the death rate increases.

Caironi*, T. Langer, E. Carlesso, L. Gattinoni 1 Istituto di Anestesiologia e Rianimazione, Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico Mangiagalli Regina Elena -Universit\u00e0 degli Studi, Milano, ItalyINTRODUCTION.To investigate the mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), many mammals have been employed in experimental models comparing the effects of different ventilatory settings. Despite the solidity of the data, a high variability of the time course and the severity of VILI have been observed among different models. Inspiratory airway pressures, tidal volume (VT) per body weight (bw), and more recently, alveolar stress (transpulmonary pressure, PL) and strain (delivered VT on the lung resting volume) have been considered as possible predictors of VILI. Our aim was to find, by a retrospective analysis of the available literature, a unifying relationship between ventilatory settings and time of achievement of a preterminal lung injury.METHODS.A medline research was performed. Articles in which healthy animals were aggressively ventilated until death or the achievement of preterminal lung injury were selected. Criteria for preterminal injury were PaO2 \\ 50 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 \\ 150, reduction of functional residual capacity (FRC) [ 50% of baseline, increase of respiratory system elastance [ 150% of baseline. VILI group included terminal-injured, control group (CG) nonterminal injured animals. Mean values of VT/bw, peak/plateau inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and time of ventilation were analyzed. Alveolar strain was computed as the ratio between end inspiratory-lung volume (VT + PEEP-volume) and FRC. PEEP-inflated volume was calculated by using respiratory system compliance (Crs). When Crs and FRC were not measured, they were estimated from physiological studies on each species. PL was estimated from values of peak/plateau airway pressure and data on the partitioned respiratory mechanics.RESULTS.Sixteen articles were selected, including 6 different species(sheep, pigs, dogs,  rabbits, rats, mice). Time of achievement of lung injury was markedly variable among different studies, ranging from 18 to 2784 minutes. Duration of ventilation was highly correlated with alveolar strain according to an exponential decay function: y = y0 + a*exp(-b*x) (r2 = 0.84, p \\ 0.01). Of note, most of the values of CG animals appeared to be leftward and downward-shifted as compared to the VILI group. No such relationship was found between other parameters and time. When duration of ventilation was normalized on alveolar strain applied, large animals showed a greater resistance to VILI as compared to small species(610 [260/1838] vs. 17 [4/59] min. -median[25/75%], p \\ 0.01).CONCLUSION. From this preliminary and retrospective analysis, alveolar strain appears to have a key role for a better comprehension of VILI among mammals. A higher susceptibility to VILI may be typical of small animals.PULMONARY FUNCTION AND EXPIRATORY FLOW LIMITATION IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE CERVICAL CORD INJURYV. Alvisi 1 , C. Volta* 1 , E.

Mills 1 1 Critical Care and Anaesthesia, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, 2 Intelligent Systems, Sheffield University, Sheffield, United Kingdom INTRODUCTION. With our improved lung volume algorithm we aimed to evaluate the ability of Absolute EIT to detect and quantify changes in individual lung ventilation.METHODS.We studied 8 patients undergoing oesophagogastrectomy using the 8 electrode Mk3.5 Sheffield EIT system in the anaesthetic room before surgery. This uses 8 stick-on electrodes evenly spaced around the thorax, 5 cm above the level of the xiphoid process. For an oesophagogastrectomy the patient is intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube to allow independent lung ventilation. EIT recordings were taken during bilateral lung ventilation Vt 800 ml. Each lung was then individually ventilated with volumes of Vt 400, 300 and 200 ml, with the opposite lumen of the double-lumen endotracheal tube open to air.RESULTS. Examination of lung air volume graphs produced by EIT of the 4 lung quadrants (fig) showed that EIT recognised bilateral and single lung ventilation in all cases (100%). Analysis of the contralateral lung during single lung ventilation revealed a small antiphase waveform, suggesting compression of the non-ventilated lung by the ventilated side. Bilateral lung ventilation tidal volume calculations by EIT were accurate to 19.0% (mean percentage error). Single lung ventilation tidal volume calculations were accurate to 19.4% for the left lung, and 21.9% for the right.CONCLUSION. Absolute EIT can identify unilateral lung ventilation. EIT is now able to calculate tidal ventilation lung volumes during unilateral and bilateral ventilation with a mean percentage error of close to 20%. Research is ongoing to improve the performance of EIT as a bedside monitor capable of indicating individual lung behaviour in mechanically ventilated patients on the ICU.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

Chang 2 1 Departments of Critical Care and Nephrology, Guy's and St Thomas' Foundation Hospital, 2 Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, St George's Hospital, London, United KingdomINTRODUCTION. The Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Network proposed a new classification for AKI distinguishing between 3 grades of severity (AKI I, AKI II and AKI III) based on changes in serum creatinine and whether renal replacement therapy was initiated. The aim of this study was to validate the criteria in a large ICU population and to evaluate the impact of AKI in the context of other risk factors.METHODS.Using the Riyadh Intensive Care Program database we applied the AKI classification to 22,303 adult patients admitted to 22 Intensive care units (ICUs) in United Kingdom and Germany between 1989 -1999 who stayed in ICU for C 24 h and did not have end-stage dialysis dependent renal failure before admission to ICU.RESULTS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that AKI I and AKI III were independent risk factor for ICU mortality [Odds ratio (OR) 1.21 for AKI I, OR 1.01 for AKI II, OR 2.11 for AKI III]. Other independent risk factors for ICU mortality were age (OR 1.02), SOFA score on admission to ICU (OR 1.03), APACHE II score on admission to ICU (OR 1.09), presence of pre-existing end-stage chronic illness (OR 1.13), admission after emergency surgery (OR 1.99), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.64), maximum number of failed organ systems (OR 2.65) and non-surgical admission (OR 2.79). AKI II and RRT were not independently associated with increased ICU mortality.Practice of RRT was very variable between different centers. Without using RRT as a criterion for AKI, 5.2% of patients with AKI III would have been classified as AKI II, 5.3% as AKI I and 13.1% would not have fulfilled the criteria for any AKI category.CONCLUSION. The AKI classification as proposed by the AKI network correlated with ICU outcome. However, without clear guidelines for the management of RRT, using RRT as a criterion for AKI III may have a confounding effect on the predictive power of the classification system as a whole.EARLY MORTALITY AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY DUE TO ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: RIFLE WITHIN 7 DAYS OR SERUM CREATININE CHANGES WITHIN 48 HOURS? A. Lassnigg* 1 , D. Schmidlin 2 , T. Neugebauer 1 , M. Hiesmayr 1 1 Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anaesthesia and Critical Care, Meduniwien Vienna General Hospital, Vienna, Austria, 2 Cardiovascular Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital, Zurich, SwitzerlandINTRODUCTION.We demonstrated recently that a minimal change in the serum creatinine concentration within 48 hrs (DCrea) after cardiothoracic surgery was associated with increased mortality within 30 days. In this investigation, we analyzed whether relative changes, as in the RIFLE classification within 7 days, confer a different prognostic potential(1).METHODS. Based on data from 4118 consecutive patients in the University Hospital Vienna, we attributed patients to the RIFLE criteria within 7 days and to DCrea groups within 48 h and 30 day mortality were calculated.RESULTS. Based on RIFLE within 7 days, acute kidney injury occurred in 323 (8%). RIFLE did not differentiate as good as DCrea -classification between the lowest risk group (DCrea-; containing 2242 patients; 54% of all patients), and groups with increased mortality. Application of RIFLE resulted in a very large reference group (3795 patients; 92%) with 3% mortality rate as compared with only 2% mortality in the reference group DCrea -(table).CONCLUSION. In the studied cardiac surgical population, RIFLE criteria misclassified a large number of patients whereas DCrea-Groups identified a higher proportion of patients with poor prognosis. DCrea-definition has the appeal of simplicity and enhanced accuracy in predicting mortality when compared with consensus definitions.REFERENCE(S). 1. Lassnigg A. Crit Care Med 2008; 36,(4).1129-37. END STAGE RENAL FAILURE PATIENTS ADMITTED TO ICU HAVE A BETTER PROGNOSIS THAN ICU PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY M. Ostermann* 1 , R. W. Chang 2 1 Departments of Critical Care and Nephrology, Guy's and St Thomas' Foundation Hospital, 2 Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, St George's Hospital, London, United KingdomINTRODUCTION.Patients with end stage dialysis dependent renal failure (ESRF) and patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) are characterised by loss of renal function per se as well as significant associated comorbidities. The aim of our study was to compare the outcome of ESRF patients admitted to ICU with that of ICU patients with severe AKI and to identify confounding factors.METHODS. Retrospective analysis of The Riyadh Intensive Care Program database which contains demographic and daily physiologic data of 41,972 adult ICU patients admitted to 22 ICUs in United Kingdom and Germany between 1989-1999. Severe AKI was defined according to the AKI classification by the AKI network (serum creatinine C 354 lmol/L, treatment with renal replacement therapy (RRT) or rise in serum creatinine by [ 300% from baseline).RESULTS.In patients with severe AKI and ESRF, mortality rose with increasing number of associated organ failure. In a multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for ICU mortality were mechanical ventilation [Odds ratio (OR) 3.05], maximum number of failed organs (OR 2.58), non-surgical admission (OR 1.59), emergency surgery (OR 1.39), APACHE II score on admission to ICU (OR 1.05) and age (OR 1.02). RRT was not independently associated with ICU mortality.CONCLUSION. ESRF patients admitted to ICU had a better outcome than ICU patients with advanced AKI, mainly due to differences in co-morbid risk factors and age.INTRODUCTION. AKI is associated with high mortality and morbidity in the ICU. There is limited data on AKI in ICU from India. Hence we evaluated the incidence and predictors of new onset Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) developing in intensive care unit (ICU) and to assess its impact on mortality.METHODS. This study was performed from June 2007 to Mar 2008. All patients with ICU length of stay (LOS) more than 48 hrs and who fulfilled study criteria were included. AKI was classified and diagnosed according to RIFLE CRITERIA. Primary outcome analysed was hospital mortality. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, Student's t-tests and multivariate logistic regression.RESULTS. Of 1250 ICU admissions during study period, 615 patients met study criteria. AKI occurred in 184 [29.9%] patients. As per the RIFLE criteria our patients fell into the following category-Risk [63.04%], Injury [6.52%] and Failure [30.43%]. Renal function improved in 55.17% of Risk group, 58.33% of Injury group and in 12.5% of Failure group.Mortality in AKI and those without AKI (NON AKI) were 57.6% and 24.1% (p \\ 0.05) respectively. 17.93% of AKI patients underwent Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) and mortality in this sub group was 87.87% (compared to 70.19% in non RRT group, p = 0.049). AKI significantly increased ICU LOS (8.1 \u00b1 5.3 vs. 5.29 \u00b1 3.9 days, p \\ 0.001) and duration of ventilation (6.65 \u00b1 5.4vs 3.1 \u00b1 4.1 days, p \\ 0.001). In AKI group non survivors had higher APACHE II (12.37 \u00b1 4.9 vs. 8.85 \u00b1 3, P \\ 0.001), SOFA (8.19 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 5 \u00b1 2 p \\ 0.001), incidence of sepsis (49.4% vs. 11.8% p \\ 0.001) and lower pH (7.27 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 7.31 \u00b1 0.1 p \\ 0.003) and PF ratio (223 \u00b1 49 vs. 239 \u00b1 35 p \\ 0.014) when compared with survivors. Sepsis (OR 5.6), vasopressors (OR 2) and comorbid conditions (OR 2.13) were risk factors for AKI on multivariate analysis.TABLE 1 PREDICTORS FOR NEW ONSET AKI BY UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS CONCLUSION.

Data were analysed retrospectively for PIRO -criteria: Predisposition [age, gender, immune suppression] , infection [SIRS of non-infectious origin, low-risk, high-risk, infection with special pathogens], response [adapted, anergia, hypergia] , organdysfunction [using SOFA-Score]. Univarate statistic was calculated using Chi2-test (alpha = 0.05).RESULTS. All patients were classified using the PIRO criteria. Total mortality was 9.5% [45/474]. Significant differences in mortality were demonstrated between the categories ''infection'' (I0 2.9%, I1 3.8%, I2 14.1%, I3 24.4%; p \\ 0.001) ''response'' (R0 2.5%, R1 7.5%, R2 35.1%; p \\ 0.001) and ''organ dysfunction'' (O0 3%, O1 3.2%, O2 25%; p \\ 0.001). Mortality in ''predisposition'' groups did not differ significantly in our population.CONCLUSION. Expected differences in mortality in the PIRO categories were reproduced except for predisposing factors. In concordance to other publications the PIRO system reflects qualitative differences in individual courses of infections. Therefore it may lead to a better distinction of patients with sepsis and could help to differentiate responders for therapeutic options. More analysis for concrete parameters is necessary for assessing factors to establish a consented system for research projects.Poster Sessions Acute kidney injury: 0967-0980 0967", "cite_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 611, "text": "[age, gender, immune suppression]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 721, "end": 749, "text": "[adapted, anergia, hypergia]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION.

Other data collected included ventilation days, ICU days, days on renal replacement therapy (RRT) and ICU survival.RESULTS. There were 75 patients who had AKI by the RIFLE criteria out of 502 admissions during the study period (14.9%). Fourteen patients were at ''Risk'', 23 had ''Injury'' and 38 were in ''Failure'' by the RIFLE classification of AKI. Twenty one patients underwent RRT. Sixteen patients underwent Slow Low Efficiency Daily Dialysis (SLEDD) for 6 to 8 h at a time, 4 patients underwent conventional haemodialysis for 4 h at a time and one patient underwent continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration. Fifty two (69.3%) patients survived. Out of the 21 patients who underwent RRT, there were 15 (71.4%) survivors. Mean duration of RRT was 7.9 \u00b1 5.4 days. Mean APACHE II score of all patients was 20.3 \u00b1 8.9. Eighteen patients (24%) required mechanical ventilation; the mean duration of mechanical ventilation in these patients was 6.7 \u00b1 5.9 days. On multiple logistic regression analysis, increasing APACHE II score was related to increased mortality (odds ratio: 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.27 p \\ 0.0005).

AKI was common in our multidisciplinary intensive care unit, and carried a significant mortality. SLEDD was the most commonly employed modality of RRT. Increasing APACHE II score was related to increased mortality. However, worsening kidney injury by the RIFLE criteria did not predict increased mortality. INTRODUCTION. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a recognized complication of cardiac surgery. For this group the mortality range is 10-83% depending on the different series, using different criteria for diagnosis and classification of AKI. Mortality exceeds 50% when AKI is associated MODS or dialysis. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) proposed consensus-based classification criteria for AKI based of incremental changes in maximum serum creatinine or hourly urine output. The AKI classification is defined by the RIFLE acronym: Risk, Injury, Failure (severity stages), Loss and End-stage Kidney disease (prognostic stages).

INTRODUCTION. The cytochrome P450 3A enzyme system (CYP3A) plays a significant role in drug metabolism. Studies suggest that chronic renal failure impairs hepatic CYP3A drug metabolism, an effect not reversed by haemodialysis. Midazolam may be used as an invivo probe of CYP3A activity. The impact of acute kidney injury (AKI) on hepatic drug metabolism is untested. This pilot study demonstrates an effect of AKI on midazolam metabolism in critically ill patients.METHODS. Patients admitted to the adult intensive care unit were excluded if they had received a benzodiazepine in the previous 24 h, were diagnosed with acute or chronic hepatic failure, were pregnant or were receiving major CYP3A inhibitors. 1 mg midazolam (i.v.) was given time 0 and serum collected at 4 h. Serum midazolam concentration was determined by mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). AKI was defined by an acute change in the eGFR prior to entry into the study. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using the modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation.RESULTS. 16 patients (10 male). Age 75(53-87). Median APACHE 18. Patients were separated into two groups; normal renal function, (8 pts) or those with AKI. Median (IQR) 4 hr midazolam concentrations were 2.86 (1.5-3.5 ) ng/ml and 3.97 (3.18-5.07 ) ng/ml respectively and differed significantly (t-test) p = 0.028.CONCLUSION. This pilot study suggests that in the critically ill patient, AKI causes a reduction in the metabolism of midazolam by the CYP3A enzymes. A bigger, more comprehensive study needs to take place to confirm these findings and also investigate the relative importance of AKI on CYP3A activity in critically ill patients. J. P.

It has been shown that the fatty acid composition of cell membranes is influenced by the fatty acid profile of dietary lipids, and may therefore be responsible for modulation of immune response (1). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a new lipid emulsion based on soybean oil, mediumchain triglycerides (MCT), olive and fish oil (SMOFlipid\u00d2) compared with a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil (ClinOleic\u00d2) on the inflammatory response in postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "A prospective randomised study. After approval of the ethical committee, 44 postoperative surgical patients with an indication for PN were included in this study. Nonprotein calories were given as 60% glucose and 40% lipids. The total energy intake per day was 25 kcal/kg body weights. Sedation regimen was standardised, propofol (lipid emulsion as a carrier) was avoided. Patients were thus allocated to one of two nutritional regimens: Group A (n = 22) received SMOFlipid\u00d2 20% (SMOF group), group B (n = 22) a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil (ClinOleic\u00d2 20%, control group). PN including lipids were given for 5 postoperative days. Interleucin-6-(IL-6), tumor tecrosis factor-alpha-(TNF-a), leukotriene B5 (LTB5), and soluble E-selectin-levels (sE-selectin) were measured before the start of infusion (d0), at day 2 (d2) and day 5 (d5) after the start of administration.

There were no significant differences between the two groups in the proinflammatory response at d0 and d2, but at d5 significantly lower IL-6-(SMOF group ( CONCLUSION. The administration of SMOFlipid\u00d2 within a parenteral nutrition regimen led at the final study day (d5) of the nutrition regimen to a significantly reduced proinflammatory response and at d2 and d5 a significantly increased anti-inflammatory response compared with a lipid emulsion based on olive and soybean oil.

Chest X-ray and spiral CT chest showed no evidence of PE, but bilateral basal lung collapse and consolidation. She was tachycardic (120 to 130/min), febrile (39.5\u00b0C), oliguric for 8 h and showed signs of ARDS. By day 5, her chest improved, but she was stuporous and remained in this state for almost 18 days. MRI showed periventricular scattered white matter hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted images (Fig.) . Septic work-up was negative and FES was suspected.

Despite being well studied molecules, little is known about the utilities of brain natriuretic peptides(BNP) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) as biological markers of right cardiac overload and inflammation in thoracic surgery. The aim of this study is to find out the patterns and activity of such these molecules after large pulmonary resection (lobectomy or pneumonectomy).METHODS.

Japan) and CRP levels, before and just after pulmonary resection and also 6, 24, 48 CONCLUSION. We observed a remarkable elevation of both, proBNP and CRP since 24 h after surgery. Plasma proBNP concentrations showed the highest increase at 72 h, possibly owing to increased right ventricular wall stress as a result of an increment of pulmonary vascular resistance. An inflammatory level peak (CRP) was found 48 h after surgery. Largest studies are necessary to analyse correlation between right ventricular function and inflammation with proBNP and CRP levels in such patients. It may be a potential predictor for both, prognostic and postoperatory complications.

All patients had undergone extracorporeal circulation and were treated with inotropic and/or vasopressor agents (7 norepinephrine, 6 dobutamine, 2 adrenaline, 3 levosimendan). A Swan-Ganz catheter was used to assess the haemodynamic parameters. Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2%) of the thenar and masseter muscles was obtained with the help of In Spectra Model 325 Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS). The brachial artery occlusion technique was utilized to better assess the endothelial function, with the calculation of the oxygen consumption rate, the reperfusion rate and the vascular reactivity.RESULTS. The haemodynamic parameters of our patients were: MAP 73 \u00b1 15 mmHg, CVP 8 \u00b1 4 mmHg, PCWP 12 \u00b1 5 mmHg, MPAP 26 \u00b1 6 mmHg, CI 2.6 \u00b1 0.7 L/min/m2, SVR 1161 \u00b1 317 dyne x s/cm5, PVR 279 \u00b1 146 dyne x s/cm5, HR 104 \u00b1 11 bpm, Hb 10.7 \u00b1 1.7 g/dl, lactate 3.5 \u00b1 2.4 mg/dl. We found a significant correlation between cardiac index and reperfusion rate (r = 0.39, P = 0.016), as well as with vascular reactivity (r = -0.39, P = 0.027). CI also correlated significantly with masseter StO2 values (r = 0.64, P = 0.001). We also found a significant correlation between masseter StO2 values and SvO2 (r = 0.53, P = 0.011), as well as with ScvO2 (r = 0.52, P = 0.014).CONCLUSION. By utilizing the occlusion technique with NIRS technology we found a correlation of NIRS derived parameters and haemodynamic indices. As adequacy of tissue oxygenation and not simple maintenance of ''ideal pressures'' is the physiologic role of haemodynamic monitoring, the potential introduction of a non-invasive method to postoperative cardiac surgery monitoring could help ensure the optimization of patient management. INTRODUCTION. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB 1) is a well known proinflammatory cytokine that initially described as DNA binding protein responsible for transcriptional events and gene expression. Further investigation focused HMGB 1 as a late appearing inflammatory mediator that persist for longer duration after initiation of inflammatory response. Previous studies have shown that cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) triggers release of proinflammatory cytokines and provokes inflammatory response. The present study was designed to investigate the changes in serum HMGB-1 levels in cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "METHODS."}, {"text": "Eighteen cardiac valvular disease patients were included in our study; AVR8, MVR6, MVR + CABG1, MVP3. Study protocol was approved by research committee of our university. HMGB-1 levels were measured before surgery (immediately after tracheal intubation,T1), 1 hr. after start of CPB(T2), 1 hr. after removal of CPB(T3), 1 hr. after ICU admission (T4), ICU day-2(T5), ICU day-3(T6). Simultaneously, hemodynamic variables, required doses of catecholamines, serum lactate concentrations and other laboratory data were recorded. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to analyze the changes in Tl-T6 values and values at T2-T6 were compared with T1 value (Dunnet's test).RESULTS. Serum HMGB-1 at T1 was 5.99 \u00b1 2.4. It significantly increased at T2 (16.76 \u00b1 9.16, P \\ 0.01) and gradually decreased at T3(9.71 \u00b1 6.11), T4(6.51 \u00b1 2.86), T5(4.98 \u00b1 1.57) and at T6(5.54 \u00b1 1.97) while IL-6, white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein(CRP) elevated postoperatively. Patients' postoperative course was uneventful and all patients discharged from ICU within 3 days.CONCLUSION. 1. Serum HMGB-1 level increased transiently during cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. 2. Patients' postoperative course was uneventful in spite of high HMGB-1 level during cardiac surgery. 3. This is the first report showing an increase in serum HMGB-1 level during cardiac surgery. 4.

The HME-F protects the BCS as well as the ventilator from the respiratory flora of the patient, allowing to use the BCS for more than one patient and extend the change interval up to 7d, which proved to be cost effective. In order to minimize cross infections, the external surface of the BCS as well as the anaesthesia bag must be disinfected after each patient.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.

PET-CT showed a PET positive lesion apical in the right inferior lobe and a positive lymph node. Bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy and EUS were tumor-negative. Right-sided pneumonectomy was performed for squamous cell bronchuscarcinoma T1N0M0, stage IA. After surgery he developed ARDS, followed by stump leakage for which revision was performed. Intercurrent airway infections were treated with antibiotics. Despite this, the patient had major problems weaning from the ventilator. CT scan showed compression atelectasis of the left inferior lobe, reason to consider the possibility of PPS. Despite absence of mediastinal shift, surgery was performed 4 months later to implant expandable prosthesis in the pleural cavity. In spite of this intervention, weaning from the ventilator was hampered by muscle weakness and swallowing difficulties leading to recurrent aspiration.RESULTS. PPS is a rare complication of pneumonectomy. Jansen et al. reported one case in a series of 640 pneumonectomies (incidence 0,2%) and just over 20 cases are reported in literature. Clinical symptoms are progressive dyspnoe, cough, inspiratory stridor, recurrent pneumonia and bronchiectasis. In reported cases the symptoms developed 5 months to 35 years after pneumonectomy. In all described patients a shift of the heart and mediastinum towards the side of the pneumectomy, causing bronchial obstruction, was found. As PPS can lead to respiratory insufficiency and death this diagnosis should be considered in every postpneumonectomy patient presenting with corresponding symptoms. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis PPS is accomplished with CT-scan and bronchoscopy, showing a shift of heart and mediastinum towards the pneumectomy-side with hyperinflation of the contralateral lung, stretching of the distal trachea and left main bronchus and lobair bronchus. The stretched airways can be compressed by pulmonary arteries, aorta and spine leading to tracheabroncho-malacia. Current surgical treatment consists of mediastinum repositioning and implantation of expandable prostheses with an additional role for airway stenting.CONCLUSION. PPS, although rare, may have contributed to the weaning problems in this patient and should be considered after pneumonectomy. INTRODUCTION.

In contrast to this observation, several in vitro studies have shown pulmonary epithelial cells to be hyporesponsive to LPS stimulation. A possible explanation is that in vivo alveolar macrophages act as a first line of defense to infections, thereby regulating the epithelial response to LPS; however the mechanisms and effects of interaction remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to further understand and characterize the pulmonary epithelial response to LPS through macrophages. It is hypothesized that the effects of LPS on lung epithelial cells occurs indirectly through the mediators released by activated macrophages.METHODS. THP1 differentiated macrophages were stimulated with LPS or vehicle and the resulting conditioned media (CM) was subsequently used to stimulate pulmonary epithelial A549 cells. Additionally, polymyxin B (PMX-B) was added to LPS CM prior to A549 cell stimulation to bind and sequester residual LPS. Epithelial cells were also stimulated with LPS alone. After 24 hrs, the epithelial production of IL1b, VEGF, and TNFa (ELISA) and the surface expression of ICAM-1 (IF) were determined.RESULTS. LPS (10ug/ml or 100ug/ml) and control CM had no direct effects on A549 cells compared to the vehicle. Incubation with LPS stimulated macrophage CM resulted in increased production of IL1b (27.45 \u00b1 0.94 pg/ml) and VEGF (1085 \u00b1 121 pg/ml) versus control CM (0 and 584 \u00b1 36 pg/ml respectively). TNFa, which is not produced by A549 cells, in the LPS CM was reduced by 75% following incubation with A549 cells, suggesting internalization of this molecule by pulmonary epithelial cells. Additionally, there was an upregulation of ICAM-1 surface expression (representative figure below) by LPS CM versus controls. All observed effects were unaltered by the presence of PMX-B.CONCLUSION. Inflammatory mediator production and adhesion molecule expression of A549 cells can be induced by LPS indirectly through macrophages. Furthermore, LPS sequestration did not alter this response, implying LPS does not enhance the effects of the macrophage mediators. By understanding these cellular mechanisms involved in LPS-induced pulmonary injury novel therapeutic strategies to prevent acute lung injury can be developed. CONCLUSION. Patients with DER are less than 4% of the total admissions in the ICU. Nonetheless they consume many resources due to the long stay and mortality.

Introduction: Danaparoid sodium (DA) is a low molecular weight heparinoid with a mean molecular weight of 6000 daltons. It consists of mainly of heparin sulfate, and high-affinity fraction of heparin sulfate inhibits factor Xa by catalyzing its binding to antithrombin (AT). In animal experiment,DA was proved to have both anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activities.The aim of this study was to investigate the potential benefits of combination therapy using DA with AT compared with the use of AT alone for the patients with SAC.METHODS. METHODS: The subjects were 22 patients with SAC in our ICU. The patients were divided into two groups, including the AT group: intravenous (iv) administration of 1500 units of AT alone and the AT + DA group: iv administration of the same dose of AT and 2500 units of DA for three days. We measured WBC, CRP, the platelet counts, the values of AT, fibrinogen, FDP, % PT before, 1 and 3 days after the administration of these medicines. Furthermore we examined the changes in scores of APACHE II, SOFA, SIRS, DIC in this study. All data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD.RESULTS. APACHE II and SIRS scores were decreased significantly in the both groups. SOFA and DIC scores before administration of medicine were significantly high compared with the AT group and significantly decreased at 3 days after the administration in the AT + DA group. The platelet counts decreased significantly in the AT + DA group. The ATIII values increased significantly in the both groups. The FDP values before the administration were significant high in the AT + DA group compared with the AT group and decreased markedly in the AT + DA group. We did not observe significant change of fibrinogen in the both groups. We observed significant increase of % PT only in the AT group.CONCLUSION. The combination therapy of using danaparoid with antithrombin could reduce SOFA and DIC scores. This therapy may have the potential benefit to improve coagulation abnormalities for the patients with SAC reducing FDP.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Japanese society of intensive care medicine. (1).

Nurses documentation towards the end of their shift and incomplete information were the main reasons for the inconsistency. Essential information were however consistent.CONCLUSION. Inspite of the observed results being significantly less than the 100% targets set by the Royal College, a similar survey in our ICU department (in 2006) showed that 92% of relatives were satisfied with the overall level of communication. Following the results of our audit we conducted a telephone survey of 70 ICU departments across UK, questioning a senior member of the nursing staff. The results showed only 10% were aware of the national guidelines; 26% acknowledged relatives within 2 minutes of their arrival into the ICU; 10% see them within 15 minutes of arrival of the patient; 24% have a daily formal interview with a doctor; 6% said relatives are seen by a consultant daily; and 100% said all communication is documented in case notes. If proposed guidelines were strictly adhered to the satisfaction of relatives would likely be significantly higher than our survey results however the reality is that ICU departments are frequently unpredictable and busy. Common reasons for failure to reach these targets are, insufficient medical or nursing staff available to talk to relatives, preoccupation of staff with emergencies and family being unable to travel to the hospital. We contend that the proposed standards are unrealistic given the busy and unpredictable nature of the intensive care environment. We suggest that overall satisfaction is ultimately the best measure to evaluate communication between health care staff and relatives of critically ill patients. METHODS.

Patient with WWLST tended to be elderly (61 mean age vs. 55.5) and more severe (SAPS 56.9 vs. 46)as compared with overall patients. The average delay between admission and ethical meeting was 12.9 days; the idea of WWLST appeared in the file in 37.2% of cases, on average 2 days before the decision.
