In this paper, we present the development of an alignment-free, digital signal processing based method for pathogenic viral detection named Z-Curve Genomic Cesptral Coefficients (ZCGCC).

The distribution of the extracted data presents a challenge known as imbalance dataset, which is addressed with the random oversampling strategy in this study.

The sixty element ZCGCC gave superior performance to the EIIP-GCC and comparable performance to FCGR. However, ZCGCC provides remarkable advantages such as low dimension, global genome analysis and low computational requirements, which make it a promising method for developing diagnostic tool for detection of pathogenic viral diseases. Future works will include an investigation of the ZCGCC for the detection of other organisms in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic domains of life. We also hope to experiment with other machine learning methods to investigate the possibility of improved performance.
