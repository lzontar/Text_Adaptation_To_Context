            "text": "Pervasive refusal syndrome (PRS) is a complex condition that affects young people leading to social withdrawal, inability or refusal to eat, drink, mobilise or speak. The affected individual regresses and is unable to self-care and quite characteristically will resist rehabilitation, worsen with praise or remain entirely passive. This systematic review was aimed at describing clinical features of PRS, current interventions and to summarise some of the nosological aspects of the condition. Without language restriction, an electronic search was conducted in Embase, PsychInfo, Medline, Cochrane library, and PubMed databases yielding 29 articles with a total of 79 cases. We performed a risk of assessment bias using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 124 articles were identified, of which 29 were included and these yielded 79 cases. Seventy-six percent of the studies had a low rate of risk of assessment bias (good quality). Our results show that PRS overlaps with several conditions, mainly affects young females aged 7-15 years and has a recovery rate of 78% if diagnosed and treated early but the duration of inpatient treatment may last up to 9.44 months (8.82 SD). The patients had multiple inter-dependent risks. The major predisposing factors included vulnerable premorbid personality and pre-existing mental disorder. Precipitating factors were stressors such as infection and traumatic experiences. Enmeshed parent-child relationship served as a maintaining factor. The themes of treatment approach are essentially rehabilitative: (1) working collaboratively with patient and family, (2) having access to multidisciplinary team, and (3) peer/group supervision. This study has systematically evaluated a large sample of patients with PRS to ascertain its clinical features and the core elements of its treatment. Its key treatment approach is a multi-modal rehabilitative strategy that is compassionate, transparent and inclusive.",

It is a potentially life-threatening condition owing to the risks associated with immobility, starvation and dehydration. PRS occurs in the absence of an organic explanation and mainly affects young people. It is one of the most challenging childhood conditions in terms of both diagnosis and treatment [2] [3] [4] . It can occur acutely or insidiously and present with a constellation of symptoms that do not easily match a specific DSM-5 [5] or ICD-11 [6] diagnostic category.",

            "text": "Since its initial description, there have been many case reports published in peer-reviewed journals, which have helped to increase awareness of the condition. Most case reports demonstrate very similar features and presentations, whilst others show peculiar aspects that create diagnostic conundrums. Clinicians, support groups and even philosophers of science [8] continue to debate the specific identity of the condition given its resemblance to chronic fatigue syndrome, catatonia, depression, anxiety, functional neurologic disorder (conversion disorder), selective mutism, and eating disorder [2] . Indeed, due to the presence of mutism, social withdrawal and immobility some experts on catatonia argue that PRS is a misnomer for catatonia [9, 10] . Jaspers et al. [4] have recommended diagnostic criteria for PRS to improve its diagnostic specificity (see Box 1). Box 1 Adapted diagnostic criteria for PRS [4] \u2022 Partial or complete refusal in three or more of the following domains: (1) eating, (2) mobilization, (3) speech, (4) attention to personal care \u2022 Active and angry resistance to acts of help and encouragement \u2022 Social withdrawal and school refusal \u2022 No organic condition accounts for the severity of the degree of symptoms \u2022 No other psychiatric disorder could better account for the symptoms \u2022 The endangered state of the patient requires hospitalization PRS is not well understood and there are a variety of theoretical models which have been proposed. In clinical practice, one or more of these paradigms may apply. These include stress and personality interaction [12] , trauma variants [1] , learned helplessness [11] , unrecognised catatonia [15] and abnormal illness behaviour [16] . The PRS term itself is considered controversial by some researchers who have suggested that the word 'refusal' connotes that the child is deliberately, consciously and actively refusing all forms of treatment which damages the relationship between child, family and treating team [12] . We have kept with PRS for clarity, as the alternative names have not been universally accepted.",

Inability or unwillingness to accept support was consistently reported across all case reports. There was a mixed picture of both active refusal and passive resistance in the asylum-seeking group and those not seeking asylum. Some of the case reports [3, 28, 32, 38, 42] described a variable pattern of refusal; ranging from active and angry refusal to passive resistance, thus, suggesting that refusal in PRS is a continuum. The most commonly reported feature in all cases was food refusal.",

This had to be reduced to 2 mg/day and was used for several months but without discernible improvement. However, it is noteworthy that when catatonia was considered a provisional diagnosis, it did not appear to have received optimum treatment. Patients received an inadequate dosage of benzodiazepine [25, 28] and those who were treated with ECT [25, 30] received insufficient sessions necessary for effective treatment of catatonia. Authorities on the treatment of catatonia recommend incremental doses of lorazepam starting at 1-2 mg/day and gradually increasing up to (10-20 mg/day), and if there is no response, to administer between 10 and 20 sessions of bilateral ECT [9, 15] . Rasmussen et al. recommend using a smaller dose of lorazepam in young, elderly, or medically compromised patients [31] . In clinical practice, parenteral administration of lorazepam offers rapid response compared to oral administration [59] .

Owing to earlier case reports of PRS that associated the condition with sexual abuse [1] , parents may appear defensive in their interaction with professionals, as they may feel scrutinised and judged. The language 'pervasive refusal' used to describe the condition can also be considered judgmental, suggesting conscious rebuttal of help. This certainly would not enhance the therapeutic relationship with patients or families.

Some of the identified stressors included traumatic experiences (sexual abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse), witnessing violence, bereavement or other significant losses, relocation, difficult transitions, and bullying episodes. Incapacitating physical illnesses such as viral infection, sore throat and surgery appear to have triggered PRS in some of the patients. Most of the patients had multiple risk factors (Box 5). Like previous reviews [3, 4, 12] , our study showed that there was a variation in the degree of impairment and clinical course of PRS, thus suggesting that the condition occurs across a spectrum. The condition can be preceded by diagnoses recognised by ICD-11 and DSM-5 before it evolves into the characteristic symptom cluster of PRS. Vulnerability factors include presence of medical illness, having a sensitive, anxious and perfectionist premorbid personality, history of mental disorder, recent significant stress (emotional or physical), history of physical or sexual abuse, family stress, and having a family member with a mental disorder.",

At least it is possible that this distinct symptom cluster arises because the treating psychiatrist is specifically looking for them and unconsciously gives cues to the patient. There is a long history of this phenomenon in psychiatric practice, separate from malingering and observer bias. Hacking [8] proposes a model for this and cites the recognised suggestibility of patients historically treated for hysteria. Hacking has termed this process 'dynamic nominalism': the interaction of new psychiatric labels, self-narration and available cultural scripts [8] .",

They acknowledge that to date it appears to have been a Swedish phenomenon and look at possible reasons for this, particularly the increased stringency in the Swedish asylum system. They also suggest that a very similar condition has been reported in the non-medical press in refugee children heading for Australia and accommodated on the offshore island of Nauru while they await processing of their asylum claim [52, 53] . Indeed, they propose that there may be a link between prolonged asylum processes and hostile foreign policy in developing and maintaining PRS illness [52] .
