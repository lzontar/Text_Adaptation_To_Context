Among the several coronaviruses that are pathogenic to humans, most are associated with mild clinical symptoms, with two notable exceptions: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2, 3] , which have caused more than 10000 cumulative cases in the past two decades with mortality rates of 9.5% and 34.4% respectively [4] [5] [6] . In December 2019, a novel pneumonia, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , emerged in Wuhan, China and has been proven to be caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7] . All the twenty-seven first cases reported by December 31, 2019 were closely related to exposure with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan [8] . By analyzing the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, it was speculated that the pathogen originated in bat, the natural reservoir host, and then transmitted to humans via an uncertain wild animal intermediate host [9] . There is convincing evidence that the human-to-human transmission has occurred since the end of December 2019 or the early January 2020 [10] . To control the spread of COVID-19, the Wuhan authority has sealed off the entire city from outside contact since Jan 23, 2020. However, it's estimated that five million people have left Wuhan before the \"lockdown\" and travelled throughout China [11] .

Both hospitals are designated hospital for COVID-19. Although small in number, the Guangzhou patients were a random sample at an early stage when cases started being imported into a major city.

There have been reports of cases in children, indicating all ages are susceptible [24] . Compared with patients in Guangzhou, patients in Wuhan were more severe, reflected by that Wuhan patients had a higher incidence of dyspnea and ARDS, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers and worse prognosis. These differences could be due to age and pre-existing conditions [8, 25, 26] . However, in the present study, we did not observe an evident difference in underlying disease between Guangzhou patients and Wuhan patients. We speculate that the differences may be related to that the diminishing pathogenicity of the virus after transmission of multiple generations [5, 27] , however, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Besides, patients in Guangzhou were more aware of the disease; thus, they visited the hospital at the earlier stage with less severe symptoms.

These findings have important implications for patient triage and hospital risk zoning. Gastroenterology outpatient medical staff could be at higher risk when encountering COVID patients, thus more aggressive PPE protection and proactive patient screening are necessary. In addition, sufficient education and protocols should be given to caregivers who could be exposed to the patients' vomits and feces directly, and feces disposal should be managed properly to reduce environmental harzards. More importantly, we found that two patients' fecal virus RNA turned negative 5 and 6 days later than the nasopharyngeal swab respectively, suggesting that transimission of virus is possibly prolonged, and fecal virus RNA may be an indispensable indicator for lifting quarantines. Given that some \"recovered\" cases being tested positive again a few days after discharged have been reported recently [29], our findings highlight the importance of fecal virus test for patient management and quarantines.

Furthermore, 10 patients from Guangzhou were involved in seven cases of clustering. This finding suggests strong community transmission poses a great challenge to the entire prevention and control. It resonates with the concept that the transmissibility increases while virulence decreases as virus spread [30] . As indicated by Tang's research, the L type of SARS-CoV-2 prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, decreased after early January 2020, while the S type, which is less aggressive, have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure [31] .
