Although it is well tolerated by most patients, it is not a benign procedure with potential complications including hypoxaemia, bleeding and pneumothorax. 3 Knowing which patient's bronchoscopy is most likely to benefit is of key importance to clinicians. While imaging can give some clues to the potential diagnostic yield of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 4 noninvasive laboratory testing is tremendously valuable. In many patients, bronchoscopy is only entertained after non-invasive testing, such as nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory viral panel (RVP), has been performed.",

What remains unknown is the ability of an NP RVP-PCR to detect viral infection involving the lower respiratory tract. Sparse data currently exist showing variable clinical correlation between NP RVP-PCR and BAL RVP-PCR obtained in the same patients. [6] [7] [8] In the accompanying article, Lachant et al. 9 sought to evaluate the findings of NP RVP-PCR compared with BAL RVP-PCR. The researchers performed a retrospective chart review of adult immunosuppressed patients who had BAL and NP RVP-PCR performed within 7 days of each other. They were able to identify 89 patients who met these criteria over a 5-year period at a single university medical centre. This institution employed the FilmArray (Biofire Diagnostic Inc, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) multiplex PCR, an assay which detects adenovirus, coronavirus (four strains), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis. The patients had a median time duration between NP and BAL testing of 2 days, and 31 of 89 patients had viruses identified on testing.",

Obtaining a positive NP finding may expedite treatment for respiratory viral infections such RSV or influenza, which have significant risk for morbidity in this patient population and effective treatments available. Based on this, it seems reasonable to recommend NP RVP-PCR prior to performing bronchoscopy with BAL when respiratory viral infection is suspected. However, the clinician must respect the risk for false negative NP RVP-PCR testing and pursue further testing, including BAL, when the clinical suspicion is high.",

The small number of patients obtained retrospectively in an observational manner offers significant limitations. The non-uniform times between obtaining the NP and the BAL samples also present a challenge, as the duration of viral shedding from the respiratory tract likely varies from patient to patient. It is likely that some of these false negative NP RVP-PCRs were due to prolonged time between obtaining NP and BAL samples. Additionally, given the highly sensitive nature of PCR studies, it is probable that non-clinically relevant viruses were discovered. How these positive results should be interpreted is unknown.",
