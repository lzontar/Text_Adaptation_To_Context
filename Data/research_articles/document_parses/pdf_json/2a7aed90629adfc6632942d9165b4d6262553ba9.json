This initiative was captured in a final document with various recommendations. 1 Recently, a summary was published as a special article in an issue of REVISTA CLINICA ESPA\u00d1OLA. 2 In general, changes to improve the quality of healthcare systems in Western countries come slowly and are plagued by difficulties: they are care structures comprising multiple professionals whose management----human, technological, and organizational----entail a high degree of complexity.",
