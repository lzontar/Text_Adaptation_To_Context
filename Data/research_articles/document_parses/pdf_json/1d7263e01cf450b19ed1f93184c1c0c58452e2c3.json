As a result of the 31 attenuation process through 570 virus passages on chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF), MVA has 32 acquired multiple major and minor genome alterations (4, 5), leading to severely restricted host 33 cell tropism (6). MVA can efficiently propagate on CEF and a baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell 34 line, while in most mammalian cells, including human cells, MVA replication is limited due to a 35 late block in virus assembly (3, 6). Its excellent safety and immunogenicity profile in addition to 36 its versatile expression system and large capacity to incorporate heterologous DNA make MVA (27-31). When circular DNA plasmids containing these CR/HL/CR sequence arrangements are 81 transfected into helper virus-infected cells they spontaneously resolve into linear 82 minichromosomes with intact terminal HL sequences (28, 29, 32) . Based on these findings, we 83 hypothesized that the three sMVA fragments designed as shown in Figure 1B -C, when co-84 transfected as circular DNA plasmids into helper virus-infected cells, resolve into linear 85 minichromosomes, recombine with each other via the shared homologous sequences, and are 86",

Two different FPV 91 strains (HP1.441 and TROVAC) (35, 36) were used to promote sMVA virus reconstitution 92 ( Figure 2A ). Ultra-purified sMVA virus was produced following virus propagation in CEF, which 93 are commonly used for MVA vaccine production. The virus titers achieved with reconstituted 94 sMVA virus were similar to virus titers achieved with \"wild-type\" MVA (wtMVA) ( Table S1) . To characterize the replication properties of sMVA, growth kinetics of sMVA and wtMVA were 110 compared on BHK and CEF cells, two cell types known to support productive MVA replication 111 (6). This analysis revealed similar growth kinetics of sMVA and wtMVA on both BHK and CEF 112 cells ( Figure 2B ). In addition, similar areas of viral foci were determined in BHK and CEF cell 113 monolayers infected with sMVA or wtMVA ( Figure 2C ), suggesting similar capacity of sMVA and 114 wtMVA to spread in MVA permissive cells. Compared to the productive replication of sMVA and 115 wtMVA in BHK and CEF cells (6), only limited virus production was observed with sMVA or 116 wtMVA following infection of various human cell lines ( Figure 2D ). These results are consistent 117 with the severely restricted replication properties of MVA and show that the sMVA virus can 118 efficiently propagate in BHK and CEF cells, while it is unable to propagate in human cells. 119",

The observation 249 that the sMVA-CoV2 vectors co-expressing S and N antigens can stimulate potent NAb against 250 SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and infectious virions suggests that they can elicit antibodies that are 251 considered effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease (16, 18, 20, 21) . We show 252 that the vaccine vectors stimulate a Th1-biased antibody and cellular immune response, which 253 is considered the preferred antiviral adaptive immune response to avoid vaccine-associated 254 enhanced respiratory disease (44, 45). We did not find any evidence for Fc-mediated ADE 255 promoted by the vaccine-induced immune sera, suggesting that antibody responses induced by 256 the vaccine vectors bear minimal risk for ADE-mediated immunopathology, a general concern in 257 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development (44, 45). In addition, based on findings with other viruses 258 associated with ADE, the stimulation of Th1 immunity with a strong T cell response component 259 appears to be the way forward to develop an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (46). 260",

We developed MVA vaccines for 38 animal models of cytomegalovirus-associated disease in pregnant women while demonstrating 39 vaccine efficacy in several clinical trials in solid tumor and stem cell transplant patients (8-13). 40 Since the outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-41 2) in December 2019 (14, 15), the virus has spread to more than 200 countries worldwide, 42 causing a pandemic of global magnitude with over 400,000 deaths. Many vaccine candidates 43 are currently under rapid development to control this global pandemic (16-18), some of which 44 have entered into clinical trials with unprecedented pace (17, 19). Most of these approaches 45 employ antigenic forms of the Spike (S) protein as it is considered the primary target of 46 protective immunity (16, 20-22). The S protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into a host cell 47 Results 66 Construction of sMVA 67 To develop the three-plasmid system of the sMVA vaccine platform, we designed three unique 68 synthetic sub-genomic MVA fragments (sMVA F1-F3) based on the MVA genome sequence 69 published by Antoine et al. (4), which is ~178 kbp in length and contains ~9.6 kbp inverted 70 terminal repeats (ITRs) (Figure 1A). The three fragments were designed as follows: sMVA F1 71 comprises ~60 kbp of the left part of the MVA genome, including the left ITR sequences; sMVA 72 F2 contains ~60 kbp of the central part of the MVA genome; and sMVA F3 contains ~60 kbp of 73 the right part of the MVA genome, including the right ITR sequences (Figure 1B). sMVA F1 and 74 F2 as well as sMVA F2 and F3 were designed to share ~3kb overlapping homologous 75 sequences to promote recombination of the three sMVA fragments (Figure 1B). In addition, a 76 duplex copy of the 165-nucleotide long MVA terminal hairpin loop (HL) flanked by concatemeric 77 resolution (CR) sequences was added to both ends of each of the three sMVA fragments 78 (Figure 1C). Such CR/HL/CR sequence arrangements are formed at the genomic junctions in 79 poxvirus DNA replication intermediates and are essential for genome resolution and packaging 80",

Similar PCR results were obtained 98 with sMVA and wtMVA for all evaluated genome positions (Figure 1E), including the F1/F2 and 99 F2/F3 recombination sites, indicating efficient recombination of the three sMVA fragments. 100 Additional PCR analysis indicated the absence of any BAC vector sequences in sMVA viral 101 DNA (Figure 1E), suggesting spontaneous and efficient removal of bacterial vector elements 102 upon sMVA virus reconstitution. Comparison of viral DNA from ultra-purified sMVA and wtMVA 103 virus by restriction enzyme digestion revealed similar genome pattern between sMVA and 104 wtMVA (Figure 1F). Sequencing analysis of the sMVA viral DNA confirmed the MVA genome 105 sequence at several positions, including the F1/F2 and F2/F3 recombination sites. Furthermore, 106 whole genome sequencing analysis of one of the sMVA virus isolates reconstituted with FPV 107 TROVAC confirmed the assembly of the reference MVA genome sequence and absence of 108 vector-specific sequences in viral DNA originating from reconstituted sMVA virus.109",

In the single recombinant vectors encoding S or N alone, termed 139 sMVA-S and sMVA-N, the antigen sequences were inserted into the Deletion (Del3) site 140 (Figures 1B and 4B) (5). In the double recombinant vectors encoding both S and N, termed 141 sMVA-N/S and sMVA-S/N, the antigen sequences were inserted into Del3 and the Deletion 2 142 (Del2) site (sMVA-N/S), or they were inserted into Del3 and the intergenic region between 069R 143 and 070L (IGR69/70) (sMVA-S/N) (Figures 1B and 4B) (5, 38). All antigen sequences were 144 inserted into sMVA together with mH5 promoter to promote antigen expression during early and 145 late phase of MVA replication (39, 40). sMVA-CoV-2 vaccine vectors were reconstituted with 146 FPV HP1.441 or TROVAC.

Staining with S-157 specific antibodies revealed abundant cell surface and intracellular antigen expression by all 158 vectors encoding the S antigen (sMVA-S, sMVA-N/S, sMVA-S/N) (Figure 4D). In contrast, 159 staining with anti-N antibody revealed predominantly intracellular antigen expression by all 160 vectors encoding the N antigen (sMVA-N, sMVA-N/S, sMVA-S/N) (Figure 4D), although cell 161 surface staining was observed to a minor extent. S and N antigen expression by the sMVA-162 CoV2 vectors was also investigated by immunofluorescence. This analysis confirmed co-163 expression of the S and N antigens by the double recombinant vaccine vectors and indicated 164 efficient cell surface and intracellular expression of the S antigen, whereas the expression of the 165 N antigen was predominantly observed intracellular (Figure S2A-C). These results demonstrate 166 efficient antigen expression by the single and double recombinant sMVA-CoV2 vectors. 167 In vivo immunogenicity of sMVA-CoV2 vectors 168 To determine the immunogenicity of the sMVA-vectored S and N antigens alone or combined, 169 SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in Balb/c mice by 170 two immunizations with the single or double recombinant vaccine vectors. High-titer antigen-171 specific binding antibodies were detected in all vaccine groups after the first immunization, and 172 an increase in these responses was observed after the booster immunization (Figure 5A-B and 173 S3A-B). While the single recombinant vectors induced binding antibodies only against the S or 174 N antigen, the double recombinant vectors induced binding antibodies against both the S and N 175 antigens. In addition, all sMVA-CoV2 vectors encoding the S antigen (sMVA-S, sMVA-S/N, 176 sMVA-N/S) stimulated high-titer binding antibodies against the S receptor binding domain 177 (RBD), which is considered the primary target of NAb(22, 24). Antigen-specific binding antibody 178 titers between the single and double recombinant vaccine groups were comparable. Notably, 179 SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific binding antibody responses stimulated by the sMVA-CoV2 180 vaccine vectors in mice exceeded SARS-CoV-2 S-, RBD-, and N-specific binding antibody 181 responses measured in human convalescent immune sera (Figures 5A-B, and Figure S4). 182 Similar binding antibody responses to those induced by sMVA-CoV2 vectors in Balb/c mice 183 were elicited by the vaccine vectors in C57BL/6 mice (Figure S5). Analysis of the IgG2a/IgG1 184 of the investigated vaccine group or antigen (Figure 5C and S3C). 186 Potent SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb responses as assayed using pseudovirus were detected after 187 the first immunization in all vaccine groups receiving the vectors encoding the S antigen (sMVA-188 S, sMVA-S/N, sMVA-N/S), and these NAb responses increased after the booster immunization 189 (Figure 5D-E and S3D-E). Similar potent NAb responses as measured using pseudovirus were 190 also observed in the vaccine groups using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure 5F-G and S3F-191 G). We also evaluated the immune sera for potential antibody-dependent enhancement of 192 infection (ADE) using THP-1 monocytes. These cells do not express the ACE2 receptor, but 193 express Fc\u03b3 receptor II, which is considered the predominant mediator of ADE in SARS-CoV 194 infection (41). THP-1 monocyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was not promoted by the 195 immune sera of any of the vaccine groups even at sub-neutralizing antibody concentrations 196 (Figure S6), suggesting absence of Fc-mediated ADE by the vaccine-antibodies responses. 197 SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells evaluated after the second immunization by ex vivo antigen 198 stimulation revealed both S-and N-specific T cell responses in the vaccine groups receiving the 199 double recombinant vectors sMVA-S/N and sMVA-N/S. In contrast, mice receiving the single 200 recombinant vectors sMVA-N or sMVA-S developed T cell responses only against either the N 201 or S antigen (Figure 6A-D, Figures S7-8). High levels of cytokine-secreting (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-202 4) S-specific CD8+ T cells were measured in all vaccine groups immunized with the S-encoding 203 sMVA-CoV2 vectors (Figure 6A). S-specific CD4 + T-cells mostly produced Th1 cytokines (IFN\u03b3 204 and TNF\u03b1), while production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) did not increase following antigen 205 stimulation (Figure 6C, S8), indicating a Th1-biased response. While activated N-specific CD8+ 206 T cells were not detected at significant frequency (Figure 6B), N-specific IFN\u03b3 and to some 207 degree TNF\u03b1-secreting CD4 + T cells were measured in all animals vaccinated with the single 208 recombinant vectors encoding N (Figure 6D and S8). No significant differences were 209 observed in the T cell levels of the single and double recombinant vaccine groups. 210 Stimulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses by both the S and N antigen was also 211 evaluated in mice by co-immunization using the single recombinant vectors sMVA-S and sMVA-212 N at different doses. This study revealed similar SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific humoral and 213 cellular immune responses in vaccine groups receiving sMVA-S and sMVA-N alone or in 214 combination (Figure S9-10). Altogether these results indicate that the sMVA-vectored S and N 215 antigens when expressed alone or combined using a single vector or two separate vectors can 216 stimulate potent SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.",

This feature greatly facilitates the 237 insertion of heterologous antigen sequences into the sMVA DNA by highly efficient bacterial 238 recombination techniques and to produce recombinant sMVA vaccine vectors. Additionally, the 239 three-plasmid system provides the flexibility for rapid production of recombinant MVA harboring 240 multiple antigens inserted into different MVA insertion sites, which can be particularly laborious 241 when generating recombinant MVA by the conventional transfection/infection procedure (3, 43). 242",

A) Schematic of MVA genome. The MVA genome is ~178 kbp in length and 812 contains ~9.6 kbp inverted terminal repeat (ITR) sequences. B) sMVA fragments. The three sub-genomic sMVA fragments (F1-F3) 813 comprise ~60 kbp of the left, central, and right part of the MVA genome as indicated. sMVA F1/F2 and F2/F3 share ~3 kbp 814 overlapping homologous sequences for recombination (red dotted crossed lines). Approximate genome positions of commonly used 815 MVA insertion (Del2, IGR69/70, Del3) are indicated C) Terminal CR/HL/CR sequences. Each of the sMVA fragments contains at 816 both ends a sequence composition comprising a duplex copy of the MVA terminal hairpin loop (HL) flanked by concatemeric 817 resolution (CR) sequences. BAC = bacterial artificial chromosome vector. D) sMVA reconstitution. The sMVA fragments are isolated 818 from the E. coli and co-transfected into BHK cells, which are subsequently infected with FPV as a helper virus to initiate sMVA virus 819 reconstitution. E) PCR analysis. CEF infected with sMVA, derived with FPV HP1.441 (sMVA hp) or TROVAC from two independent 820 virus reconstitutions (sMVA tv1 and sMVA tv2), were investigated by PCR for several MVA genome positions (ITR sequences, 821 transition left or right ITR into internal unique region (left ITR/UR; UR/right ITR), Del2, IGR69/70 and Del3 insertion sites, and F1/F2 822 and F2/F3 recombination sites) and absence of BAC vector sequences. PCR reactions with wtMVA-infected and uninfected cells, 823 without sample (mock), or with MVA BAC were performed as controls. F) Restriction fragment length analysis. Viral DNA isolated 824 from ultra-purified sMVA (sMVA tv1 and sMVA tv2) or wtMVA virus was compared by KpnI and XhoI restriction enzyme digestion.",
