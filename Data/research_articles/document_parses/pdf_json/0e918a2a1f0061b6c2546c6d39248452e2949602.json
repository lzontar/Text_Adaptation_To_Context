Even as health care systems in these relatively well-equipped regions are strained, there will soon be a need to focus on populations in low-income countries (LICs) where health care resources are limited even before facing the demands of the pandemic. Along with social distancing, handwashing has been advised repeatedly as one of the key actions to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic (CDC 2020; WHO , 2019 . In a systematic review of physical interventions employed to reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, handwashing was indicated to be effective with a meta-analytic summary estimate of a 45-55% reduction in transmission (Jefferson et al. 2009 (Jefferson et al. , 2011 . Similarly, a systematic review of the effectiveness of personal protective measures in preventing H1N1 pandemic influenza transmission in human populations indicated a 38% reduction in transmission with handwashing, whereas mask use appeared to be less effective and data for cough etiquette was insufficient (Saunders-Hastings et al. 2017) .

Briefly, this tool uses a two-stage modeling framework that includes a mixed effect linear regression model, followed by a ST-GPR step to model the proportion of the population with access to a handwashing station on premises with available soap and water by year and location from 1990 to 2019. This model allows us to borrow strength across space and time and to leverage information from predictive covariates in order to produce a complete set of estimates for all GBD locations and estimation years. The linear regression model included as covariates the proportion of individuals with access to piped water (modeled in a similar fashion from country-specific surveys) and the sociodemographic index (SDI; a composite measure including income per capita, education, and fertility), with region and super-region random effects. In total, 153 surveys from 88 countries and territories were included as inputs ( Figure 1 ). Piped water was included as a covariate because there was an observed statistical relationship between piped water and handwashing access in surveys where both were collected and because more complete information on piped water was available from surveys than for handwashing access. We therefore used estimates of piped water as a predictive covariate to improve estimates of handwashing. All of the included handwashing access data sources were from the years 2008-2019. For the piped water covariate, piped covariate, we included 1103 input data sources, spanning from 1980 to 2018. In total, we estimated access for 204 national and nonsovereign locations (e.g., Guam, Puerto Rico) and 858 subnational administrative areas. In India, we also modeled urban and rural locations as source input data and covariates were coded to urban and rural locations through the GBD collaborator network.

In 46 countries, more than half of the population lacked access, and in eight countries (India, Nigeria, China, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia) more than 50 million persons were estimated to be without handwashing access.

In this context, suppression of transmission has heightened urgency. Inadequate access to handwashing facilities with soap and water remains prevalent in many LICs, and this is likely to facilitate COVID-19 transmission. Rural populations have disproportionately poor access to handwashing facilities; for example, across India, state-level estimates ranged from 6% without access (Mizoram) to 31% (Odisha) in urban areas, and from 13% without access (rural Delhi) to 68% (Jharkhand) in rural areas. However, access is also limited in urban slums and other informal settlements. Our estimates indicate that, in 2019, 15% of the population in urban Delhi, 58% in Addis Ababa (province) and 54% in Nairobi (province) lacked handwashing access. Should the pandemic coincide with water shortages, such as those seen in Cape Town and Chennai in 2019 (Holden and Doshi 2019), access will be further restricted and will disproportionately harm those who can least afford to pay for water. In densely populated urban areas, social distancing is also very challenging given the high population densities. Further, effective within-household quarantine is likely impossible with larger families living together in a single home. Reducing COVID-19 transmission in high-density urban areas with low access to handwashing may prove especially difficult and will require urgent attention and implementation of alternative strategies to those implemented in HICs and MICs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 247, "end": 255, "text": "Table S1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 289, "end": 297, "text": "Table S2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Alcohol-containing handrub solutions are an efficacious alternative to hand washing with soap and water (Kampf 2018) .

However, reliance on handrub solutions is less desirable compared with handwashing given the requirements for sustainable production and distribution, the cost implications for low-income populations, the concerns regarding flammability of reagents, and the potential for poisoning due to ingestion of handrub solutions (Gormley et al. 2012 ). Further, access to handwashing with soap and water can offer more equitable and lasting protection in future epidemics and can also protect against nonepidemic transmission of diarrheal disease (Wolf et al. 2018 ) and lower respiratory infections (Mbakaya et al. 2017; Rabie and Curtis 2006) if sufficiently maintained. Indeed, in 2017 inadequate access to handwashing was estimated to be responsible for 35% of the global diarrheal disease burden and 9.7% of the global burden from lower respiratory infections, in total accounting for 38.4 million disability-adjusted life years (95% UI: 22.8 million, 52.0 million), and 707,000 deaths (95% UI: 416,000, 1,022,000) (GBD 2017 Risk Factor Collaborators 2018 . Increases in these and other common causes of death unrelated to COVID-19 are also likely to be affected as LIC health care systems are overwhelmed during the pandemic. Immediate efforts to increase handwashing access or alternatives could help alleviate some of the baseline disease burden from diarrhea and lower respiratory infections during the pandemic and spare valuable resources to focus on COVID-19 cases. Progress toward improving access to handwashing has been accelerated given the recognition of its importance in two of the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals-namely, reducing childhood mortality and combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases-and more recently as part of Sustainable Development Goal 6, which is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, with the indicator 6.2.1 used in this analysis (SDG Global Indicator Platform 2018). With estimates provided here for 2019, this analysis presents the most recent and comprehensive global estimates of handwashing access to date, including estimates for 204 national and nonsovereign locations and 858 subnational administrative areas. The enhanced spatial resolution gained by including subnational locations reduces the potential for spatial misalignment between survey responses and population density, thereby providing a more accurate picture of the true population with access in each country, and offers policy makers more detailed and actionable evidence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 442, "end": 462, "text": "(Gormley et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 660, "end": 677, "text": "(Wolf et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 713, "end": 734, "text": "(Mbakaya et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 735, "end": 757, "text": "Rabie and Curtis 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1142, "text": "(GBD 2017", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1173, "text": "Risk Factor Collaborators 2018", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Region"}, {"text": "As in most global-scale analyses, these estimates include several limitations. Most important, although we developed comprehensive global estimates, a number of potential sources from 2000 to 2005 reported a soap indicator that included other handwashing agents such as ash, sand, or soil and, therefore, did not meet the JMP's definition for basic hygiene. This considerable limitation is reflected in the uncertainty in national-level estimates. These national-level estimates are based on recently available survey data; however, the year of the most recent survey varies by location, also contributing to uncertainty. Although our spatiotemporal model estimates incorporate trends to estimate access in 2019, the most recent source input data may have been from earlier years (see Excel Files S1 and S2). Similarly, estimates for years prior to 2008 were derived from the ST-GPR model and not from survey inputs. This is reflected in the uncertainty intervals (see Figures S22-S29) . Further, our estimates likely do not reflect recent disruptive events such as conflicts, largescale migrations, or natural disasters. These events are likely to increase the number of people living without access to handwashing and also to increase the number of people living in densely populated settings where social distancing is also challenged. Because the input data sources are based on snapshot observations, they also do not reflect intermittent or discontinued water supplies that can be common in many locations. Data coverage was best throughout Africa and relatively poor in South America and South and East Asia (Figure 1 ). Our estimates also do not include access to handwashing facilities in non-household settings such as schools, workplaces, health care facilities, and other public locations such as markets.

Specifically, we produce estimates on a much broader spatial and temporal scale. The most recent JMP report includes estimates for 96 countries up to the year 2017 (UNICEF 2019) as well as urban and rural estimates for most of those locations, whereas we have estimated for 1,062 national and subnational locations from 1990 to 2019. We are able to do so because our modeling methods borrow strength across time and space and they leverage information from predictive covariates to produce estimates for locations without data. The first stage of our modeling process involves running a mixed-effects linear model, with fixed effects on SDI and proportion of the population with access to a piped water source and country-and region-level random effects. These covariates inform the model fit in all locations, especially those without data. After the linear model was run, the next steps involved spatial and temporal smoothing. Essentially, when estimating for any given location-year, data points that are geographically and temporally proximate are weighted more heavily than more distant data points. For example, if a subnational location has no data, the national-level data informs the model fit; similarly, in a country with no data, the region-level data informs its estimates. Our estimation models allow for nonlinear trends, borrows strength from similar sources to extend spatial coverage, uses predictive covariates to inform estimates, and leads to more robust estimates by including both large and smaller surveys.

The overall correlation coefficient between the two sets of estimates (for locations where the JMP provides estimates) was 0.94, whereas the year-specific correlation coefficient ranged from 0.91 (comparing 2017 estimates, the most recent year of JMP estimates) to 0.985 (comparing 2003 estimates).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Region"}, {"text": "We have presented estimates of access to handwashing facilities, which is an imperfect proxy for actual handwashing behavior given that previous research indicates that the prevalence of actual handwashing is lower than the prevalence of access to handwashing facilities (Freeman et al. 2014; Wolf et al. 2018) . Despite this limitation, our approach has two notable advantages. First, although adequate data exist to model access, data on handwashing behavior are inadequate to support a reliable global model. Second, the proportion of people with access to handwashing likely represents the upper limit of the proportion of people engaged in handwashing.

For example, R 0 estimates may be higher and/or more uncertain in settings with poor handwashing access compared with those estimated from HIC settings where the first wave of the epidemic has largely been completed.
