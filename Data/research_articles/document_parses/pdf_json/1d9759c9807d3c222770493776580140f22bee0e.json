Therefore, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view, this investigation examines how organisations have used coopetition to cope with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Key examples include retailers sharing information about stock levels, pharmaceutical organisations working together to develop a vaccine, technological giants collaborating for the greater good, and charities forming alliances for a joint cause. This paper strengthens the extant literature by highlighting the heterogeneity of coopetition strategies that firms can use within a global crisis. Practitioners must balance the risks and rewards of coopetition activities. In turn, they should decide whether to continue to cooperate with their competitors once the pandemic has ended, or resume operating under individualistic business models. This article ends with some future research directions.",

            "text": "Another noticeable way that firms have changed their business models is through the amount of cooperation between competing organisations (coopetition) that has occurred because the COVID-19 outbreak has had such a profound effect on the world economy (Independent, 2020; The Guardian, 2020) . Indeed, even policymakers have engaged in coopetition activities (e.g., through contact tracing between rival government agencies in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey), given the impact of the pandemic and the need to balance economic and health-related goals (National Post, 2020) . Coopetition is defined as \"a paradoxical relationship between two or more actors, regardless of whether they are involved in horizontal or vertical relationships, simultaneously involved in cooperative and competitive interactions\" (Bengtsson & Kock, 2014, p. 180) . Coopetition strategies pertain to companies sharing resources (e.g., equipment and funds) and capabilities (e.g., knowledge and experience) for mutually-beneficial outcomes 1 (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000; Park et al., 2014; Gnyawali et al., 2016; Pattinson et al., 2018) . In fact, although discussing network relationships more broadly than coopetition, Ritter et al. (2002) note that an ability to effectively deal with the interactions among network relationships is a core competence of a firm, proceeding to add this has a direct bearing on a firm's competitive strength and performance. Consequently, while there are some drawbacks associated with these inter-firm activities not being managed effectively, ranging from tensions, through to opportunistic behaviours Raza-Ullah et al., 2014; Czakon & Czernek, 2016; Crick et al., 2020) , a large volume of research surrounds the performance-enhancing benefits of coopetition (Ritala, 2012; Felzensztein et al., 2014; Velu, 2016) .",

Therefore, it is unclear how practitioners within organisations (small and large) can manage the interplay between cooperation and competition to cope with the potentially devasting effects of widespread emergencies (e.g., . This is a concern because it is difficult to make recommendations to scholars and practitioners about whether coopetition is (or is not) a performance -driving business-to-business marketing strategy in these volatile circumstances.

            "text": "The resource-based view examines the link between organisations' resources and capabilities and their performance (Barney, 1991) . A fundamental assumption of this lens is that larger companies, with a greater volume of resources and capabilities, can typically out-perform smaller-sized firms, with fewer assets at their disposal (Barney, 1991; Nason & Wiklund, 2018) . To create a competitive advantage, firms' utilisation of resources and capabilities can manifest in assets that are well organized; also, of value, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (Kozlenkova et al., 2014) . Nevertheless, owner-managers' possession of resources and capabilities does not necessarily lead to a competitive advantage; instead, strategic flexibility in decisionmaking is often important (Priem & Butler, 2001) . Consistent with the resources and capabilitiesperformance-enhancing relationship of resource-based theory, earlier research evidences the benefits of employing coopetition as a business-to-business marketing strategy (Gnyawali & Charleton, 2018; Hannah & Eisenhardt, 2018) . As an illustration, Rindfleisch & Moorman (2003) highlighted that if organisations collaborate with their competitors (what they referred to as inter-firm cooperation), they can obtain new resources and capabilities (combined with their own assets) to yield higher-levels of performance compared to if they operated under an individualistic business model. However, although the resource-based view helps explain how these resource and capability-sharing activities positively impact company performance, it inadequately considers the nature of relationships within the coopetition strategies, namely, in terms of which rivals that firms cooperate with and how this takes place (as noted by Crick, 2019). The relational view focuses on how high-quality inter-organisational relationships J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (potentially including with competitors) can positively affect company performance (Dyer & Singh, 1998) . In fact, recent work by Barney (2018) extended the resource -based view to encapsulate a stakeholder dimension, recognising circumstances in which decision-makers should work closely with key partners (e.g., competitors in this current study) to be more successful in their markets. It follows that resource -based theory and the relational view can be integrated to examine the cooperative and competitive aspects of the coopetition construct, including how decision-makers need to work with rivals that are trustworthy for mutuallybeneficial outcomes (building on Lavie, 2006; Barney, 2018; Dyer et al., 2018) . Henceforth, guiding this current investigation was an infusion of resource-based theory and the relational view to evaluate the implementation of coopetition strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Coopetition gained some attention among business-to-business marketing scholars in the 1990s, with the emergence of two schools-of-thought. On the one hand, Brandenburger & Nalebuff (1996) viewed coopetition as being an organisation-wide mind-set pertaining to managers and functional-level employees believing in the importance of cooperating with industry rivals. On the other hand, Bengtsson & Kock (1999) argued that coopetition is a set of firm-level behaviours, whereby, organisations share resources and capabilities with their competitors to improve their performance within their markets. In fact, this latter perspective has led to a continuing interest that involves decision-makers' resource and capability-sharing activities and the relationship with aspects of company performance (see Luo et al., 2007; Bouncken & Kraus, 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2018; Crick & Crick, 2019) . Furthermore, Bengtsson & Kock (1999) did not formally define the coopetition construct; rather, they focused on cooperation with competitors. One year later, Bengtsson & Kock (2000) described coopetition activities as being the interplay between cooperation and competition, in which two rival firms collaborate. Subsequently, they extended their conceptualisations to acknowledge that coopetition can be implemented in horizontal and vertical channels, as well as between multiple rivals (see . This current paper used these developments to explore the heterogeneity of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coopetition construct (horizontal and vertical activities) that apply to a potentially large number of industry rivals (not just two competitors). More specifically, how various forms of coopetition relate to respective practitioners' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Indeed, in their seminal work, Bengtsson & Kock (2000) noted that there can be situations where the degree of cooperation is outweighed by the magnitude of competition within a market (and vice -versa), or these paradoxical forces are equally matched. In other words, in all coopetition partnerships, any collaborative behaviours will interact with some form of rivalrous actions (see Park et al., 2014; Czakon & Czernek, 2016; Gnyawali & Charleton, 2018) .",

            "text": "An emerging body of literature surrounds the antecedents (or drivers) of coopetition strategies. For instance, Gnyawali & Park (2011) used case study data from Sony and Samsung Electronics to explain how larger-sized corporations (as opposed to under-resourced entities) are equipped with the mechanisms to engage in coopetition. They proposed that a critical driver of coopetition strategies is a coopetition-oriented mind-set. In other words, Gnyawali & Park (2011) argued that if managers and functional-level employees believe in the importance of cooperating with their competitors, these values and assumptions should manifest into J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f behavioural forms of coopetition, such as sharing resources and capabilities with rival entities (reinforced by Gnyawali & Charleton, 2018; McGrath et al., 2019) . Another antecedent of coopetition is associated with the magnitude of competition within a market. That is, for coopetition to exist, organisations require rival firms to collaborate with (Bengtsson & Kock, 2000; Bouncken & Kraus, 2013; Hoffmann et al., 2018) . Thus, certain researchers have explored how competitive forces (like competitive intensity) provide the market-level conditions for coopetition strategies to be implemented (e.g., Ang, 2008; Park et al., 2014; Bengtsson et al., 2016 ). Yet, for coopetition to be effective, owner-managers need to engage in relationships with trustworthy rivals for mutually-beneficial outcomes, including potentially targeting complementary product-markets (Czakon & Czernek, 2016; Felzensztein et al., 2018; Lascaux, 2020) .",

Indeed, from an outside-in perspective, recognition exists of the need for decision-makers to be market-led (Day, 2014; Mu et al., 2018) . To illustrate, Day (2014, p. 28 ) offers suggestions of typical questions resulting from an outside -in perspective. \"How and why are customers changing? What new needs do they have? What can we do to solve their problems and help them make more money? What new competitors are lurking around the corner, and how can we derail their efforts?\" In the context of this current study, the latter question is pertinent, sinc e coopetition activities can assist decision-makers to sense and seize opportunities by collaborating with competitors rather than derailing them as part of their business models (following Ritala et al., 2014; Velu, 2016) . Nevertheless, in later sections of this paper, some of the barriers to engaging in coopetition activities are illustrated, since political, bureaucratic, and legal forces that can hinder companies from working with their industry rivals throughout global emergencies (Neuwirth & Svetlicinii, 2015; Schiavone & Simoni, 2019) . If lifted (or relaxed), these environmental barriers can serve as antecedents of coopetition during a pandemic crisis, like COVID-19, providing that decisions-makers exhibit strategic flexibility in reacting to changing circumstances (as per Priem & Butler, 2001 ).",

That is, with \"too little\" coopetition, organisations might struggle to achieve their objectives due to possessing an insufficient volume of resources and capabilities (Rusko, 2011; Dahl, 2014; Velu, 2016 ). Yet, with \"too much\" coopetition, there might be a range of dark-sides, including tensions (e.g., conflict, power imbalances, and opportunistic behaviours), lost intellectual property, and diluted competitive advantages (Tidstrom, 2014; Lacaux, 2020) .",

To emphasise an earlier point, coopetition strategies are comprised of the paradoxical forces of cooperativeness and competitiveness, meaning that regardless of the extent to which managers and functional-level employees share resources and capabilities with their partners, they are industry rivals (as noted by Mattsson & Tidstrom, 2015; Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016) .

While limitations exist in all construct measures (Lee & Cadogan, 2013) , coopetition is best-captured in a way that reflects how cooperative and competitive dimensions underpin these business -to-business marketing strategies (see Bengtsson & Raza-Ullah, 2016; Gnyawali & Charleton, 2018) . This explains why certain operationalisations of the coopetition construct in existing studies have involved a multiplication of cooperation and competition (as per Bengtsson et al., 2016; Shu et al., 2017) . In other words, to accurately measure coopetition activities, academics must establish a tool that captures the propensity of these cooperative and competitive behaviours, or the extent to which firms collaborate with their competitors (Bouncken & Kraus, 2013; Bouncken et al., 2018) . This is not a simple task to achieve, as there are differing views on how to capture the variance of coopetition activities. Therefore, this current study draws on practitioner-based insights to illustrate varying 'collaborative' changes in firms' business models in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, when conducting quantitative research involving the operationalisation of the coopetition construct, scholars must find a suitable J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f setting for their investigations. An ideal empirical context for coopetition-based research is a sector that hosts high-degrees of cooperativeness and competitiveness (as noted by Dahl, 2014; Velu, 2016) . For example, earlier work has utilised data from agricultural businesses (Rusko, 2011; Felzensztein et al., 2018) , sporting organisations (Crick & Crick, 2019), high-tech firms (Ang, 2008; Gnyawali & Park, 2011) , alcohol producers (Felzensztein & Deans, 2013; McGrath et al., 2019) , and automotive manufacturers (Andersson & Nyberg, 1998; Akpinar & Vincze, 2016) . Hence, when evaluating coopetition during times of crisis (as per this curre nt investigation), not only does there need to be these cooperative and competitive forces at play, but also, there should be a crisis that has evidently negatively impacted a sector (following Pangarkar, 2007; Medrano & Olarte-Pascual, 2016) . The link between coopetition and COVID-19 is discussed in the next section.",

In the marketing domain, a crisis can take many forms, b ut ultimately, it surrounds a large-scale situation where an event has involved a drastic and negative impact on an organisation, its customers, competitors, employees, and other relevant stakeholders (see Clark, 1988; Grewal & Tansuhaj, 2001 ). However, a limited body of knowledge surrounds marketing in a pandemic crisis offering an opportunity to contribute to the business-to-business marketing literature. Existing research has focused on public policy decisions or business-to-consumer marketing activities -as opposed to business-to-business marketing relationships (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2004) . Furthermore, there have been many investigations associated with health marketing in dealing with crises, but these investigations are typically focused on hospital s and care providers managing resources and capabilities to treat patients (as noted by Schiavone & Simoni, 2019) .",

For example, Pangarkar (2007) found that engaging in alliances assisted organisations to improve their survival prospects during the global financial crisis. Pangarkar (2007) highlighted that alliances helped these organisations to lower their operating costs, boost productivity, and create value for their customers (supplementing Rindfleisch & Moorman, 2003; Ritala, 2012; Hannah & Eisenhardt, 2018) . Therefore, this current paper investigates ho w coopetition has been implemented by certain organisations in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These issues complement the recent work that has examined other business-to-business marketing strategies related to this global pandemic (e.g., Cortez & Johnstone, 2020). The subsequent news stories are related to pertinent issues within the business -to-business marketing literature to demonstrate the heterogeneity of the coopetition construct and its benefits for the companies involved, together with their customers, and other key stakeholders. These extend, through a coopetition perspective, the topical points made by other scholars regarding how firms might adapt their business models in response to COVID-19 (Chesborough, 2020; Lund Pedersen & Ritter, 2020).",

Yet, public health officials allowed members of the public to leave their homes to purchase essential items, like food and medical supplies, as well as getting exercise within a close geographic proximity. Therefore, supermarkets have been in high-demand, with consumers engaged in panic-buying goods, such as canned food, toilet paper, dairy products, meat, and vegetables (Daily Mail, 2020). Amidst this \"new reality\", competition laws in the United Kingdom have been relaxed to allow retailers to share data ab out stock levels, coordinate closure times (to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f allow cleaning and inventory replenishment), access supply chain networks, and loan employees between rival stores (Independent, 2020). There can be certain legal, political, and bureaucratic regulations that prevent organisations from engaging in coopetition activities during a pandemic (as noted by Neuwirth & Svetlicinii, 2015) . In this instance, by allowing competing retailers to share these resources and capabilities, they have been able to operate more efficiently, like having higher-levels of stock to meet an unprecedented demand.",

            "text": "The example of British retailers engaging in coopetition relates to vertical and horizontal channels (Lacoste, 2012; Velu, 2016) . Furthermore, these supermarkets are still being regulated to ensure that collusion does not occur, but to a lesser extent than before the COVID-19 outbreak (Independent, 2020). Accordingly, there are two issues that connect these behavioural forms of coopetition with the business -to-business marketing literature. One factor is that coopetition helps firms to improve their performance, but only up to a fixed point, since there are environmental-level forces (e.g., the prior-mentioned political, bureaucratic, and legal regulations) that can limit their performance (following Luo et al., 2007; Raza-Ullah et al., 2014) . Another area to consider is that under resource-based theory and the relational view, there are environmental conditions that can affect the strategies that organisations implement (Priem & Butler, 2001; Crick & Crick, 2020) . From a market-led perspective, these forces can drive decision-makers to seek support from external stakeholders (e.g., rivals) to survive and grow within their markets (Day, 2014; Mu et al., 2018) . Thus, coopetition in the British retailing sector provides an illustration of how changing market conditions can cause companies to adapt their business models to engage in coopetition strategies. In doing so, it offers improved insights into the aspects of the competitive business environment that can affect the coopetition paradox in times of crisis. This expands earlier work that has focused on factors, like competitive intensity, and their effect on these activities (Ang, 2008; Park et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2018) .",

These rivals have been sharing scientific data, such as from experiments and clinical trials to expedite the process of finding treatment options for the disease. As already noted, there are often bureaucratic, political, and legal factors that serve as barriers for the implementation of coopetition strategies during pandemics (Neuwirth & Svetlicinii, 2015; Schiavone & Simoni, 2019) . In this situation, the facilitation of inter-country-level coopetition has taken place through not only relaxed laws on cooperation versus competition, but also, a common incentive to develop a cure, or at least treatment options as quickly as possible. To stress an important consideration mentioned earlier, during all coopetition partnerships, there needs to be a mutually-beneficial outcome, which is typically higher-levels of performance (Bouncken & Kraus, 2013; Czakon et al., 2020) . Here, that shared outcome is the greater good for human health (and the associated economic benefits), offering a new, but large-scale reason for engaging in coopetition as a business-to-business marketing strategy (building upon Rusko, 2011; Ritala, 2012; Crick, 2019) .",

This news story relates to Bengtsson & Kock's (2000) seminal paper on coopetition having varied degrees of cooperation, vis-\u00e0-vis, competition. That is, there are situations where firms are more collaborative than competitive (see Bengtsson et al., 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2018) . This news story from the New York Times (2020) shows how companies that normally exhibit high-degrees of rivalry have used this global pandemic to collaborate for the greater good. Furthermore, there has been scarce research pertaining to coopetition in an international arena (e.g., Felzensztein et al., 2014; Shu et al., 2017) . This inter-country-level coopetition arrangement illustrates how companies can pool resources and capabilities across national borders for mutually-beneficial outcomes. In fact, it supports Luo's (2007) argument that globalisation allows competitors to collaborate to achieve shared performance outcomes, even if they are located across large distances.",

The reason being is that during the heightened uncertainty, together with the larger number of people working from home and using the internet for online shopping, there is an increased chance of cyberattacks, such as phishing attempts. The COVID-19 CTI League contains approximately 400 members from competing firms focused on reducing these electronic threats. In the case of the COVID-19 CTI League, these high-tech firms already possessed the beliefs and assumptions that cooperating with rival firms is likely to help them to perform better than if they competed under an individualistic business model (as evidenced by Security, 2020) . This supports earlier studies that have found that a coopetition-oriented mind-set is a key driver of behavioural forms of coopetition (e.g., Gnyawali & Park, 2011; Gnyawali & Charleton, 2018; McGrath et al., 2019) . As such, they were ready to engage in these collaborative business -to-business marketing strategies in this time of crisis. It appears that the members of the COVID-19 CTI League were equipped with the resources and capabilities required to foster their coopetition-oriented mind-sets into coopetition strategies to play an important role in helping consumers and organisations during the pandemic. Hence, it is important that organisations can develop their coopetition strategies by investing value -adding tangible and intangible assets to obtain mutually-beneficial outcomes from their business-to business relationships (reinforcing Ritala et al., 2014; Czakon & Czernek, 2016) .",

This has meant that charities are facing higher-degrees of pressure, in terms of needing to help vulnerable populations. This societal-level contribution of this business-to-business J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f marketing strategy towards the COVID-19 pandemic relates to the mutually-beneficial non-profit outcome of coopetition activities that charities aim to fulfil, as opposed to sales and profitability, which is of greater interest to private companies (see Milne et al., 1996) . In other words, the employment of this form of coopetition has taken place to tackle the devastating consequences of the pandemic, whereby, these non-profit organisations have put aside their competitive differences (regarding the need for donations) to work together for this joint cause (Wyllie, 2020) . Over and above the \"social\" value of these business -to-business marketing relationships, this form of coopetition symbolises that these activities assist under-resourced organisations to yield higherlevels of performance, alongside other mutually-beneficial outcomes (following Bengtsson & Kock, 2000; Rusko, 2011; Hannah & Eisenhardt, 2018) . Furthermore, these charities have shown how changing marketlevel forces can alter the cooperative and competitive dynamics within a sector, driving these non-profit organisations to collaborate with their rivals (building upon Priem & Butler, 2001; Crick, 2019) . Some managerial implications and recommendations follow.",
