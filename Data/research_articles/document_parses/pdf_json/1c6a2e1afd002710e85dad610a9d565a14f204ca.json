Respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the primary cause of mortality, although other clinical manifestations including gastrointestinal manifestations. Currently, the management of COVID-19 is supportive, therefore there is an urgent need for effective specific treatments. Preliminary observations suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes are at higher risk of severe disease [6], while mortality risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection include advanced age, high SOFA score, and D-dimers greater than 1 \u03bcg/mL [7] . There is currently an urgent need for data about COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients, because immunosuppression may be associated with a more severe disease course and outcome. Data are arising in kidney transplantation [8, 9] , but no information is available in the liver transplant population.",

In terms of CT imaging, the evolution of the infiltrates in this patient was similar as the one reported in non-immunosuppressed patients [16, 17] or in patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir [18] . Different treatments are currently being tested in patients with severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including tocilizumab and remdisivir [19, 20] . Recent data indicate that the treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir is not associated with a significant decrease in mortality compared J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 to supportive care [13] , although the authors reported that the between-group difference in the median time to clinical improvement (15 days vs. 16 days) was significant.
