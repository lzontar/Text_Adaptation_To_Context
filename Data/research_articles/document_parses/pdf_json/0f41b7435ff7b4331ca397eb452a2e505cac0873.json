This section presents a SEQIR model of COVID-19 based on the current situation of the disease in Indian environment. We espouse an alternate that reproduces several key epidemiological properties of COVID-19 virus. The present model structure of COVID-19 describes the dynamics of \u2026ve sub-populations of Indians such as susceptible (S(t)), Infected but not detected by testing population (E(t)), quarantined (Q(t)), Con\u2026rmed infected population who are in under treatment in isolation word (I(t)) as well as population who are lived in secured zone not a\u00a4ected by COVID-19 virus (R(t)). We assume total population size of India is N (t) and N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + Q(t) + I(t) + R(t). In this model, quarantine refers to the separation of infected individuals from the common Indian population when the populace is infected but not infectious. By Infected Indian population, we guess that the Indian individual who have con\u2026rmed infected by the COVID-19 virus. Again by population in secured zone, we presume those Indian individuals who have not a\u00a4ected by corona virus disease.
