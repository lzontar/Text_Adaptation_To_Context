Here, complementary tests based on real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses targeting the singlestranded RNA-composed virus and immunological approaches monitoring the development of immune responses of infected (and recovered) individuals have been established. 4, 5 Advantages and limitations exist with both strategies, and various factors are suspected to affect the reliability of the analytical result; 1 yet, diagnostics are indispensable, and comprehensiveness and testing frequency is considered to be of particular importance in supporting the confinement of the pandemic. 5, 6 An option to facilitate the testing of different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be the extension of existing analytical platforms from conventionally collected venous blood samples (including whole blood, serum, and plasma) to minimal-invasively sampled capillary blood as dried blood spots (DBS) or dried plasma spots (DPS), in line with recent initiatives e.g. by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) 7 or the Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm, Sweden, 8 as well as earlier investigations into targeting anti-influenza IgG antibodies. 9 Different versions of DBS and DPS collection kits are commercially available and are frequently employed in different areas of drug monitoring and testing.

DBS were dried at room temperature for 2 h and then stored in a plastic bag in the presence of 0.5 g desiccant sachets until analysis. Further, a single sample of venous blood was collected into 4 mL K2EDTA (1.8 mg/mL) or SST II Advance tubes (both BD Vacutainer, BD Heidelberg, Germany) from each participant. The plasma/serum was separated by centrifugation (20 min @ 1300 rpm) within 4 h post collection and stored at +4\u00b0C until assayed. Overall, the pilot study cohort was composed of 18 men and 8 women, age ranging from 28-64 years, 21 of which underwent prior SARS-Cov-2 PCR tests yielding 16 positive results (Table 1) .

Plasma samples were prepared in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols for analysis using the respective test kits. Of note, deviating information existed as to the compatibility of the EDI ELISA with plasma; while the manufacturer lists serum only as test matrix, the distributor mentioned plasma also as applicable specimen. Hence, for a subset of 4 participants, both serum and plasma were tested for IgGs. DBS were prepared for IgG and IgM analysis by extraction into an aqueous EDTA solution (1.35 mg/mL). Therefore, entire spots were punched from DBS cards and cut into eighth, while the absorbent material from the Mitra tips was merely removed from the plastic support. The test materials were then placed into polypropylene tubes (2 mL), fortified with 100 \u00b5L of aqueous EDTA, and ultrasonicated for 10 min.

On the other hand, performing the actual test and interpreting the analytical result in controlled working conditions and by expert personnel in analytical laboratories contributes to obtaining bestpossible test results. 6 Sample preparation strategies for DBS analyses were obtained by adapting the assay manufacturers' protocols and assessing the effect of modifying parameters such as the blood volume used to produce DBS (5-20 \u00b5L), duration of ultrasonication (10-60 min), and sample / buffer dilution ratios.

International initiatives have recently been launched, 7, 8 developing DBS-based testing approaches to exploit the substantial advantages associated with dried test matrices collected by individuals without the need of medical supervision. In order to provide diagnostic values equivalent to serum or plasma samples, the compatibility of test assays with extracts from DBS (including potentially required adaptations of sample pretreatment protocols) has to be thoroughly assessed or, alternatively, assays specified (amongst other matrices) for DBS analyses have to be established and characterized.
