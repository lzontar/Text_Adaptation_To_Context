Cell surface receptors bind the extracellular particles, initiate local intracellular signals, and reorganize the actin cytoskeleton to induce the change in cell shape needed to engulf the particle, eventually resulting in the formation of a large vacuole known as a phagosome. A similar process also occurs in macro-pinocytosis (literally, cell-drinking) , where large endocytic vacuoles (typically >500 nm in diameter) continuously form, resulting in the engulfment of large amounts of both extracellular medium and plasma membrane, containing solutes and single molecules such as proteins, which are thus internalized in a nonspecific manner. Both these types of endocytosis eventually end up in the fusion of the vesicles with lysosomes, which represent the major hydrolytic compartment of the cell. These are large (1-2 \u00b5m in diameter), acidic (~pH 4.5) vacuoles containing a variety of acid hydrolases (lipase, carbohydrases, nucleases, proteases) , targeted to these organelles from the Golgi apparatus through the addition of a mannose-6-phosphate tag.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 582, "end": 608, "text": "(literally, cell-drinking)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1206, "text": "(lipase, carbohydrases, nucleases, proteases)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endocytosis"}, {"text": "Receptor-mediated or clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a more specific, active event where the plasma membrane folds inward to form pits coated with the cytosolic protein clathrin. These regions of the plasma membrane usually contain specific protein receptors, including the receptors for transferrin, low-density lipoproteins, growth factors, antibodies and several others. Once these receptors bind their specific ligands, an active process is triggered by which small (~100 nm in diameter) vesicles form, having a morphologically characteristic crystalline coat made up of a complex of proteins associated with clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs). These vesicles progressively undergo maturation to first become early endosomes, which show a tubulo-vesicular morphology (vesicles up to 1 \u00b5m in diameter connected by tubules of ~50 nm in diameter) and mildly acidic pH. These are principally sorting organelles, where many ligands dissociate from their receptors due to the acidic pH and from which many of the receptors recycle to the cell surface. Most of the early endosomes mature into late endosomes, which essentially receive internalized material en route to lysosomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endocytosis"}, {"text": "A fourth macromolecule internalization pathway is caveolar endocytosis. Caveolae are non-clathrin-coated, plasma membrane flask-shaped invaginations (~50 nm in diameter), which exist on the surface of several cell types, including adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and fibroblasts. These microdomains are often associated with the protein caveolin -which, however, is not essential per se to the process of clathrin-independent endocytosis -and mostly correspond to the regions of the plasma membrane in which the lipid bilayer is enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and is characterized by decreased fluidity; caveolae thus represent one category of the detergent-resistant microdomains of the cell membrane collectively known as lipid rafts. Caveolae bud from the plasma membrane and lead to the formation of caveolin-containing endosomes, named caveosomes. These are pH-neutral, long-lived compartments, which are known to eventually fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the Golgi apparatus, thus delivering their contents into these compartments. Similar to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and unlike the other types of endocytosis, caveolar endocytosis requires the GTPase enzyme dynamin. Of note, all types of endocytosis except caveolar endocytosis end up with the delivery of the internalized material into the lysosome compartment, where it is destined for degradation. This has obvious relevance for both gene and drug delivery, since escape from degradation is an essential requisite for efficient treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endocytosis"}, {"text": "The material internalized into the cells within endosomal vesicles is outside of the cytoplasm, thus still virtually resident in the extracellular environment. Therefore, efficient gene delivery requires the nucleic acids to pass through a biological membrane bilayer, either by destruction of the membrane itself or by physical passage. In this respect, nature has evolved different mechanisms allowing entry into the cytoplasm of macromolecules contained inside the various vesicle compartments, which are variously exploited by a number of cell pathogens to enter the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In particular, viruses and toxins essentially use two main pathways to gain access to the cytosol: they can either be transferred from early or late endosomes into the cytosol in response to low pH, or enter the Golgi and then the ER and be transferred to the cytosol from this destination. An example of the first mechanism is offered by the diphtheria toxin, for which the relatively low pH found in endosomes triggers a conformational change in the toxin that drives formation of a membrane pore allowing its direct entry into the cytosol. Other molecules instead reach the Golgi apparatus and the ER following a route in reverse of the classic secretory pathway. These molecules include plant toxins, such as ricin, and bacterial toxins, such as Shiga toxin, part of cholera toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A; these often consist of two chains or domains, one responsible for cellular internalization and trafficking, and the other one exerting the biological effect proper of the toxin. Classical secretion is characterized by transport of newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi, followed by budding of vesiculated cargos from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), vesicle sorting in the cytoplasm, and eventual vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Toxin cell entry is enabled by binding to a cell surface molecule, followed by endocytosis. Once in the early or late endosomes, toxins escape lysosomal degradation by re-routing the vesicles toward the TGN and, from this, to the ER, either directly or through the Golgi apparatus. Once toxins have reached the ER, the cytoplasm is accessed by taking advantage of the ER protein auditing system known as ERAD (ER-associated protein degradation). This mechanism eliminates misfolded proteins from the ER by discarding them into the cytoplasm through a pore known as the Sec61 translocon, which is actually also used by several of the toxins. Finally, certain mammalian viruses, such as polyomaviruses, influenza viruses, coronaviruses, and echoviruses, and some toxins, such as cholera toxin, use caveolae-mediated transport from the cell surface to reach the ER. This has been particularly studied for the simian virus 40 (SV40), which is internalized from lipid rafts and, through caveosomes, is eventually released into the ER, from which it escapes to the cytoplasm and gains access to the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Escape from the Intracellular Vesicle Compartment"}, {"text": "In the case of viruses of interest to the gene therapy field, access to the cytoplasm is either attained by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the cell plasma membrane (for retroviruses) or by escape from the endocytic degradation route through the endosomolytic activity of the viral capsid (for adenoviruses and AAVs).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Escape from the Intracellular Vesicle Compartment"}, {"text": "Finally, a therapeutic nucleic acid, once escaped from the intracellular vesicles, must find its way to the relevant subcellular compartment where its function is exerted, which is usually either the cytosol or the nucleus. Short regulatory RNAs are often active in the former compartment, while coding genes must access the latter to be transcribed. The final destination of the nucleic acid is commonly dictated by the proteins to which it binds once in the cytosol. For example, siRNAs are loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and remain in the cytosol (see section on 'Small Regulatory RNAs'). In contrast, coding nucleic acids are bound by various DNA binding proteins, including transcription factors, which direct them to the nucleus thanks to their nuclear localization signal (NLS), or gain access to the nucleus during mitosis. Nuclear targeting can be enhanced through the delivery of nucleic acids complexed with short peptides binding to proteins of the importin/karyopherin family, a set of proteins that actively transport macromolecules into the nucleus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nuclear Targeting"}, {"text": "The gene transfer methodologies that are clinically exploitable by gene therapy can be divided into four categories.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods for Gene Delivery: An Overview"}, {"text": "(i) Simple utilization of naked plasmids (circular, covalently closed DNA molecules) or short regulatory nucleic acids (oligonucleotides, siRNAs, and others), not complexed with other molecules and simply injected in vivo or added to the extracellular milieu of cultured cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods for Gene Delivery: An Overview"}, {"text": "(ii) Facilitation of nucleic acid entry into the cells by physical methods.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods for Gene Delivery: An Overview"}, {"text": "(iii) Transport of nucleic acids into the cells by lipofection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods for Gene Delivery: An Overview"}, {"text": "(iv) Embedding of nucleic acid sequences within viral genomes, then exploiting the natural property of viruses to enter target cells at high efficiency.

The production of synthetic DNAs and RNAs, or the use of plasmid DNA produced in bacteria, which can be obtained in large quantities, offer important advantages in terms of simplicity and safety of use compared to viral vectors. Indeed, the efficiency of viral vectors is strictly related to the biological characteristics of the parental virus they derive from, which, in several cases, are still not very well understood. Furthermore, production of viral vectors requires the development of complex procedures based on cell culture and infection in order to obtain packaging of the therapeutic nucleic acids inside the virions. These procedures pose important safety problems, due to the possibility that either the packaging cells contain other infectious agents or the viral vector itself might recombine to generate a replication-competent virus. Finally, some viral vectors induce a powerful inflammatory and immune response once injected into the patients. Despite these problems, the efficiency of gene transfer that can be attained by viral gene transfer both in vivo and ex vivo is by far superior to that of any non-viral method.

When therapeutic nucleic acids are carried into the cells by viral vectors, their destiny depends on the biological characteristics of the vector that is used. Vectors based on adenoviruses persist for prolonged periods in an episomal, non-integrated form inside the nucleus of the transduced cells; however, the cells themselves are usually rec-ognized and destroyed by the immune system in a 1-2-week period.

As discussed above, most of the content of the endocytic vesicles formed along this pathway is destined to lysosomal degradation. However, a tiny fraction can escape the early or late endosomes, cross the endosomal membrane, gain access to the cytosol, and, from this compartment, be transported to the nucleus.

The method consists in the application of a series of electric pulses (typically, in the order of ~200 V/cm for tens of milliseconds, or higher voltages for microseconds) in order to induce a transient increase in membrane permeability and thus allow entry of large, charged macromolecules, including plasmid DNA.

Once in the endocytic vesicles, the positively charged amine groups of the polymers are believed to exert a so-called \"proton sponge\" effect, according to which the low endosomal pH determines entry, into the endocytic vesicles, of chloride ions, followed by osmotic rupture of endosomes and release of DNA into the cytosol.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 452, "end": 461, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "Cationic Polymers"}, {"text": "One of the major problems related to the use of polyplexes for gene transfer is their toxicity, due to the positive charge of the polymers and the large size of the polymer-DNA complexes that are eventually formed.

One class of very interesting polymers in this respect is the amphipathic block co-polymers, consisting of alternating blocks of simple hydrophobic homopolymers and simple hydrophilic homopolymers.

The polymer modification consists in variations of the size, three-dimen-sional structure, or reactivity towards other molecules. Typical examples of intelligent polymers consist of block co-polymers formed by methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 2-(dimethylamino)-ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). MMA is hydrophobic, while DMAEMA is hydrophilic; the block co-polymer is thus formed by alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks, with a prevailing overall hydrophilic characteristic.

The processed nucleophilic 3'-OH ends of the viral cDNA are then inserted into the backbone of the target DNA through a transesterification reaction. Integration is random in terms of sequence specificity, however it commonly occurs in regions containing actively transcribed cellular genes. The reason for the selection of these \"hot spots\" is still unclear. It might be related to the presence, within these regions, of a relaxed chromatin structure that is more accessible to PICs compared to heterochromatic regions, or be due to the specific interaction of some still uncharacterized components of PICs with cellular factors involved in transcription.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Replicative Cycle"}, {"text": "Transcription. After integration, the proviral DNA genome can be considered as an additional protein-coding gene of the cell. In fact, transcription of the provirus is carried out by cellular RNA polymerase II and involves the same set of transcription factors that control expression of cellular genes (general transcription factors, mediator, chromatin modification and remodeling factors). The promoter controlling transcription corresponds to the U3 region of the 5' LTR. This sequence is very different in the various members of the Retroviridae family, since it consists of a bricolage of transcription factor binding sites of the host cell. The presence of these binding sites confers the provirus the property of being expressed in specific cell types or upon specific cell stimulation. As an example, Figure 3 .11 displays a schematic representation of the HIV-1 LTR with the indication of the cellular transcription factors binding to this sequence. In some complex retroviruses, besides cellular transcription factors binding the LTR, transcription is controlled by an accessory protein encoded by the viral genome (e.g., Tat in the case of HIV-1 and Tax in the case of HTLV-1). In particular, HIV-1 Tat binds a highly structured RNA sequence positioned at the 5' end of the viral mRNA named TAR (trans-activating response). From that region, Tat mediates transcriptional activation by recruiting, to the viral LTR promoter, on one hand cellular proteins possessing histone-acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and thus inducing chromatin relaxation and, on the other hand, the cellular P-TEFb kinase, which phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal tail of RNA polymerase II, a modification required for transcriptional elongation.

The primary mRNA is used for translation of gag and pol, which occurs in the cytosol, and the shorter for env, which is translated by ribosomes associated with the ER. In the case of deltaretroviruses (e.g., HTLV-1), lentiviruses (e.g., HIV-1), and spumaviruses the situation is more complex, since these viruses also code for a series of accessory proteins, for each of which at least one specific mRNA is required. These shorter mRNAs are generated through a multiple splicing process making use of different 5' (splicing donor, SD) and 3' (splicing acceptor, SA) splicing sites. For example, in cells infected with HIV-1, over 35 different mRNAs are generated, which can be classified into 3 different classes according to their length (Figure 3 .12). The longer class has ~9 kb and includes a single transcript, corre- sponding to the primary mRNA generated by proviral transcription; this mRNA codes for two polyproteins corresponding to Gag and Gag-Pol (see below).

In the case of Gag and Pol, proteolytic cleavage of the polyproteins is carried out by the viral PR enzyme; in the case of Env, a furin protease of cellular origin cleaves the polypeptides inside the Golgi apparatus in parallel with protein glycosylation and before the protein is exposed onto the plasma membrane. While Env is produced from one or more specific mRNAs, Gag and Gag-Pol are usually translated from the same mRNA. In gammaretroviruses (the most frequently used to generate retroviral vectors; e.g., Mo-MLV), the gag and pol genes are on the same open reading frame (orf), separated by a single Stop codon. The ribosome starts translation from the first AUG to synthesize the Gag polyprotein; once it reaches the Gag Stop codon, sometimes it ignores it (in-frame suppression of termination), inserts an additional amino acid instead of this codon, and then continues translation, thus generating a polyprotein also containing Pol. In alpharetroviruses (ASLV) and lentiviruses (HIV), Gag and Pol are on different orfs. Thus, formation of the Gag-Pol fusion polypeptide requires a ribosomal frameshift during translation, by which the ribosome, once in correspondence with the gag 3' extremity, moves one nucleotide backward and changes reading frame.

If the cells are exposed to genotoxic stress (e.g., are treated with X-rays, or \u03b3-rays, or other DNA-damaging agents) or are infected with another virus (typically, adenovirus or herpesvirus), the AAV DNA, once exited from the endosomes, is efficiently transferred to the nucleus and replicated by the cellular machinery with the assistance of the viral protein Rep.

Most AAV serotypes use ubiquitous molecules that are expressed at high levels by most cell types as receptors for internalization, such as HSPGs or sialic acid linked to cell surface glycoproteins and gangliosides (Table 3.7) ; as a consequence, internalization of these vectors occurs in most cells. However, in the majority of cell types, the vector DNA does not reach the nucleus or, most frequently, is not converted from its single-stranded DNA form to double-stranded DNA, a step that is obviously essential for transcription to occur. In vivo, only a few tissues show high-level natural permissivity to AAV transduction. These include the heart (cardiomyocytes), skeletal muscle (skeletal myofibers), brain (neurons), retina (ganglionar cells, pigment epithelium and photoreceptors), and, to a lesser extent, liver (hepatocytes). The reasons why the virus is particularly efficient in these cell types are still largely unknown, but clearly involve molecular events following vector internalization inside the cells. For example, after injection of AAV2 in the brain, the vector transduces neurons very efficiently but does not transduce glial cells at all, even though these cells express much higher levels of HSPGs on their surface. Of note, all the cell types that are naturally permissive to AAV transduction are post-mitotic and will never re-enter the cell cycle; it is thus likely that the DDR proteins that bind single-stranded DNA and block AAV transduction in replicating cells are downregulated in these permissive cell types. Indirect evidence of the impor-tance of single-stranded to double-stranded DNA conversion in determining efficiency of transduction is the significantly higher transduction efficiency of the so-called self-complementary AAV vectors (scAAVs), in which the gene cassette is cloned in the form of two complementary copies, positioned in tandem one after the other; the DNA of these vectors is thus capable of spontaneously forming double-stranded DNA by internal self-complementation.

Examples of these proteins are TK and ribonucleotide reductase (RR), two enzymes dispensable in cell culture but essential for viral DNA replication in neurons, where cellular DNA replication proteins are no longer expressed; the vhs (virion-host shut off), the product of the UL41 gene, which rapidly destabilizes and blocks translation of the infected cell mRNAs; and the neurovirulence factor ICP34.5, which allows continuation of translation in the infected cells notwithstanding the activation of the cell kinase PKR, which would otherwise phosphorylate and inactivate translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 as an antiviral defense mechanism. Different studies have revealed that the attenuated, replication-competent HSV-1 vectors are not only capable of replicating autonomously but, when inoculated into the brain, also circulate to areas different from those of the original injection, similar to the wild-type virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 547, "end": 556, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}], "section": "Attenuated, Replication-Competent Vectors"}, {"text": "Wild-type HSV-1 replication in neurons begins immediately after entry of viral DNA into the infected cell nucleus.

Deletion of the IE genes generates mutants that only replicate in cells in which the missing functions are supplied in trans.

On the other hand, the production of high-titer preparations of amplicons is considerably more difficult than that of replicationdefective vectors.

Different modified viruses have been produced so far for this purpose. The first generation contained mutations in a single gene, aimed at limiting viral replication in actively replicating cells. The genes considered included the gene UL23 (ICP36), coding for TK, or the gene UL39 (ICP6), coding for the major subunit of RR, or the gene coding for the neurovirulence factor ICP34.5. While use of the first two mutants did not extend beyond animal experimentation due to the risk of toxicity, different mutants of ICP34.5, which show considerable anti-tumor effect in animal models, are currently the subject of different clinical trials.

A second generation includes viruses bearing multiple mutations, in particular, ICP34.5 plus ICP6, currently also in clinical experimentation.

The five viral vectors differ substantially in terms of persistence of their genome in the transduced cells and duration of therapeutic gene expression. Gammaretroviruses and lentiviruses integrate into the host cell genome and are thus permanently inherited at every cell division. These are the vectors of choice for the treatment of inherited disorders with recessive monogenic transmission, in which permanent correction of the molecular defect is the therapeutic goal. However, in several circumstances, gammaretroviral vectors especially undergo progressive silencing of gene expression, due to irreversible proviral methylation. In contrast, albeit not being integrated into the genome, AAV transduces long-living and non-replicating cells, and thus persists for month-or year-long periods in these tissues; probably because it remains episomal, methylation-induced transcriptional silencing does not occur and therapeutic gene expression persists. In contrast, the duration of gene expression is very short with first-generation adenoviral vectors, not because of any intrinsic property of the vector itself, but due to the recognition of the transduced cells by the immune system: in immunocompetent animals, expression of the therapeutic effect usually does not last longer than 10-14 days after inoculation. This can still be useful in conditions in which persistence of expression is not required or desirable: this is the case, for example, of gene therapy of cancer or genetic vaccination, or when gene therapy is used to transiently express a growth factor, for example to stimulate therapeutic angiogenesis. Finally, the vectors based on HSV-1 might become very useful for the prolonged expression of genes in the brain, thus exploiting the property of the wild-type virus to persist in episomal form in the neurons for the whole life of the infected organism.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy: Fields of Application and Comparative Evaluation"}, {"text": "Induction of undesired effects.

Both replication-defective and oncolytic HSV vectors raise concerns for their possible reactivation and consequent neurovirulence. Finally, the production of adenoviral, gammaretroviral, lentiviral, and replicating herpesviral vectors is fraught with the possible generation of autonomously replicating wild-type or recombinant viruses.

At the levels of production, a recombinant event occurring between the packaging plasmid and the plasmid containing the lentiviral vector can generate a replication competent lentivirus (RCL), the infectivity of which can be even extended by the presence of the VSV-G protein. A similar recombination event could also occur at the moment of reverse transcription in the transduced cells, should the virion carry two RNA genomes, one corresponding to the transfer vector and other to the packaging plasmid. At the level of clinical application, once used for gene therapy of HIV-1 infected patients, first-generation lentiviral vectors might recombine with the wild-type virus infecting the patients, thus potentially leading to the creation of novel viruses, with unpredictable potential for diffusion and pathogenicity. Finally, should first-generation lentiviral vectors be used in an HIV-1-infected patient, it is also possible that vector replication is stimulated by infection of the transduced cells with wild-type HIV-1: in this case, the wildtype virus would act as a helper for vector replication, since the vector construct contains all the sequences necessary for replication, including transcription (LTR), packaging (\u03c8), reverse transcription (R, PBS, PPT), and integration (U3).

The currently available vectors significantly differ in their capacity to accommodate DNA fragments of different lengths, with a spectrum ranging from 3-4 kb for AAV vectors, to 8 kb for retroviruses, to 30-40 kb for gutless adenoviral vectors, to 150 kb for HSV amplicons. In evaluating these lengths, one has to consider that the coding portion of human genes has an average size of ~1.5 kb; as a consequence, even the relatively small size of AAV allows the delivery not only of short regulatory RNAs but also of the vast majority of therapeutic cDNAs. The size of vectors becomes substantially limiting in two specific situations, namely when the cDNAs to be transferred are exceedingly long (for example, in the case of dystrophin -9.7 kb, or coagulation Factor VIII >8 kb), or when transcription of the therapeutic gene needs to be strictly regulated, a condition usually requiring very long regulatory elements (for example, for gene therapy of thalassemias or diabetes). In these situations, the possibility of using gutless adenoviral vectors or herpetic amplicons would be most desirable. In particular, the latter class of vectors appears suitable to accommodate entire genetic loci, composed of the whole gene (exons plus introns) and its regulatory elements.Simplicity of production. The production systems for the different vectors are quite different. In the case of amphotropic and ecotropic gammaretroviral vectors, the possibility to utilize packaging cell lines offers an obvious advantage in terms of simplicity and cost. In contrast, production of AAV, lentiviral, and herpetic amplicon vectors is based on transient transfection of plasmids in the producer cells. Transient transfection is however also used for gammaretroviral vectors when VSV-G pseudotyping is required. Another issue related to vector production concerns the purity of the preparations and, in particular, the contamination of vectors with autonomous replicating or helper viruses.Efficiency of transduction. The gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors, both pseudotyped with VSV-G, are capable of transducing a vast number of cell types. However, one of the strict requirements of gammaretroviral vectors is that the infected cells are in active replication. This characteristic substantially prevents the use of these vectors in most cell types in vivo and restricts their utilization to ex vivo cultured cells. In contrast, lentiviral vectors can transduce non-replicating cells, albeit provided that they are metabolically active. These vectors can thus successfully be used for gene transfer in neurons in vivo and in non-stimulated hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo. Adenoviral vectors are also very efficient in transducing both replicating and non-replicating cells and, by virtue of the utilization of the ubiquitously expressed CAR receptor, are capable of transducing most cell types, both in vivo and ex vivo. These vectors are probably the most efficient delivery system currently available both in terms of number of transduced cells and levels of therapeutic gene expression. However, in replicating cells, their efficacy is limited by the lack of integration into the genome: during cell proliferation and expansion, they progressively become diluted or lost. AAV vectors also use ubiquitous receptors for internalization (HSPGs and sialic acid) and are thus internalized by most cells. However, the tropism of these vectors is essentially restricted by events occurring after internalization and involving vector transport to the nucleus and, mostly, single-stranded to double-stranded DNA conversion. The efficiency of these events essentially restricts AAV transduction to postmitotic tissues such as brain, retina, skeletal muscle, and heart. AAV vectors thus represent the vectors of choice for transduction of these tissues. The recent identification of an array of different AAV serotypes now extends their use to other organs, such as liver, pan-", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}]}
