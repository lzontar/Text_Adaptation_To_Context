All the cats were accustomed to the shelter environment having lived there for at least 8 weeks before the start of the protocol. In accordance with previous studies (de Mari et al. 2004; Gil et al. 2013) , the inclusion criteria included the following: (1) cats of any age, breed or sex (heterogeneous population), (2) cats that showed at least one clinical sign potentially related to retroviral infections, (3) cats that had previously shown a positive rapid immuno migration FIV and/or FeLV test result. Exclusion criteria were (1) cats with any type of malignancy/neoplasia (such as lymphoma or lymphoid leukaemia), (2) cats having received immunomodulating drugs (such as corticosteroids) during the 4 weeks before the study, (3) cats having received antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the 2 weeks before the study and (4) cats that did not complete the therapeutic protocol. Initially, all cats were retested to confirm their FIV/FeLV infections by using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA) (ViraCHEK/FIV and ViraCHEK/ FeLV, Synbiotics). Animals were housed in two different catteries, according to their FIV or FeLV status. Animals concurrently infected with FIV and FeLV were housed in the FeLV cattery. All the cats in each cattery were treated and during the study, no incoming animals were allowed. For the purposes of analysis, cats were divided into three different groups according to their retroviral status: FIV positive cats (n=7), FeLV positive cats (n=6) and co-infected animals (n=3).",

            "text": "SAA is a small protein that appears to be the precursor of amyloid protein A, a major protein of \u03b1-amyloid which is potentially involved in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases (Uhlar & Whitehead 1999) . Among its major functions, SAA acts as a scavenger of oxidised metabolites, protecting tissues from excessive damage induced by inflammation (He et al. 2006) . As with AGP, its measurement has been reported in different feline diseases (Kajikawa et al. 1999 , Sasaki et al. 2001 , Tamamoto et al. 2008 ). C-reactive protein (CRP) was the first APP described and it is considered to be a major protein in different species such as humans and dogs (Ceron et al. 2005 , Schultz & Arnold 1990 ). Among the major functions in the immune system, CRP is involved in the activation of the classical complement pathway, the enhancement of phagocytosis or even the modulation of polymorphonuclear cells (Schultz & Arnold 1990) . Because CRP does not appear to be involved in the feline acute phase reaction, it has not been very well studied or documented in the cat (Ceron et al. 2005) . In human medicine, several studies describe its increase in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients (Jahoor et al. 1999 , Treitinger et al. 2001 , even after immunomodulation therapy with exogenous IL-2 ( Barbai et al. 2010) . Despite the similarity between HIV and FIV (Hosie et al. 2009 , Hartmann 2011 , the CRP behaviour in FIV positive cats undergoing immunomodulating therapy remains unknown.",

Results of CRP values are presented in Fig 3. From D0 to D65 there was an increase in CRP concentrations in all the cats (P=0\u00b70001; increased CRP in 16 cats). This increase was approximately 1\u00b78 times the baseline value. Values on D30 and D65 were above the upper limit of the RI (38 to 186 \u00b5g/mL) for FIV, FeLV and co-infected cats, Only one cat of the FeLV group (cat 9) received supportive therapy at D65, namely intravenous fluids, because of suspected otitis/vestibular syndrome and mild-dehydration. This fact was considered as a co-morbidity factor and was included in the clinical-evaluation and considered in the clinical score.

Despite the low number of animals a possible explanation may be sub-clinical diseases leading to a particular alteration at this time point. However, considering that the statistical difference was only evident at this particular time point, this finding was not considered biologically significant. According to previous studies which reported that AGP and SAA are good predictors of immunomodulation (Kajikawa et al. 1999 , Hochepied et al. 2003 , these results support the hypothesis that rFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy may modulate pro-inflammatory innate mechanisms.

From the beginning (D0) until the end of the treatment (D65) a significant increase of CRP concentrations was noted. Although CRP has not been considered as a useful biomarker of inflammation in cats, this study shows that this APP behaves similarly to SAA and AGP.

In contrast, and due to a progressive defect of helper T-cells, FeLV cats do not usually present with hyperglobulinaemia being more prone to have severe cytopenias (Gleich & Hartmann 2009 ). According to this study, the increase of APPs was similar in FIV and FeLV, suggesting that the innate-immune stimulation must have the same basis in these two groups. No studies were performed to correlate \u03b3-globulins with APPs in retroviral infected cats, and whether rFeIFN-\u03c9 interferes with serum protein electrophoresis profiles remains unclear. It has been previously demonstrated that rFeIFN\u03c9 results in an overall clinical improvement not only of FIV but also FeLV and co-infected cats (Gil et al. 2013) . Clinical signs, evaluated by a score-scale, decreased in the three groups (FIV, FeLV and co-infected) meaning an overall improvement of symptomatic cats. In total, 10 of 16 improved their clinical signs while 6 of 16 remained stable. Furthermore, a significant decrease in excretion of other viruses was also observed concomitantly (Gil et al. 2013) . Correlating the APP profile with these previous results, it was observed that APP concentrations increased in cats with concurrently improved clinical signs and reduced viral excretion. This finding was consistent even in cats with low clinical scores and in those where scores remained stable with therapy. Recognising that APPs may be increased in different situations such as chronic infections and severe inflammation (Ceron et al. 2005 , Paltrinieri 2008 ), this concurrent clinical improvement and the decrease in the loads of other viruses reinforce and sustain the hypothesis that rFeIFN-\u03c9 therapy potentiates the immune response and may involve a beneficial APP increase in treated animals.",
