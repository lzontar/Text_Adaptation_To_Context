In a recent work [1] , experimental medical data on the survival of coronavirus on various surfaces have been presented. Deposition of liquid samples consisting of water with the coronavirus culture on a surface of various materials is common in everyday life and medicine (plastic, cardboard, stainless steel). Surprisingly the lifetime of the virus depends significantly on the substrate material and can differ by almost an order of magnitude. For brevity, below we will call these samples aqueous ones, although the composition of the liquid fraction is more complex. The mechanisms of influence of a substrate material are not known now. Therefore, in our opinion, it is impossible to explain such behavior only by the specific biological interaction of viruses and materials. All experiments [1] were carried out in laboratory conditions at a constant temperature and, apparently, constant illumination. We suppose that the evaporation of aqueous samples plays an important role in the survival of the coronavirus under given conditions.",

The highest number of incidents of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is observed in countries located from 30 to 50 degrees north latitude [2] . Obviously, these countries are primarily linked by the climatic factor in the sense of moderate temperatures and high humidity in winter and spring. Therefore the evaporation rate of water samples with virus is quite low at such conditions. The resistance of viruses to adverse environmental factors is determined by their structure. In biology, it is customary to distinguish between simple and complex viruses. Simple, or non-enveloped, viruses consist of nucleic acid and protein coat (capsid). Complex or enveloped viruses outside the capsid are also surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope (supercapsid) outside the cap- * P.S.

            "text": "It is known that both absolute (AH) and relative humidity (RH) affect various types of viruses [6, 7] . Currently a number of biological and chemical mechanisms of the influence of composition of aqueous samples on viruses are considered: water activity, surface inactivation, salt toxicity etc. [6] . We would like to discuss a purely physical mechanism of influence here. We propose a new hypothesis about the influence of evaporation of aqueous samples with coronaviruses on the survival of coronaviruses. We suppose that the movement of the evaporation front through the liquid layer with the virus leads to the cessation of its activity. The resulting local nanoscale curvatures of the liquid surface lead to the appearance of huge local gradients in hydrostatic pressure, which cause damage to the virus. The high resistance of viruses to external comprehensive mechanical loads is well known [8, 9] . We assumed that the lifetime of the virus during the movement of the evaporation front is significantly reduced due to additional mechanical stresses on some whiskers in a nanolayer of liquid above the virus. Indeed, when the evaporation front moves under the action of capillary forces (Laplace pressure), a pressure drop of about 10 bar at a diameter of 80 nm acts on the coronavirus. At the same time, a pressure of out 140 bar is already acting on his \"whiskers\", which have characteristic dimensions of 10-20 nm. Inhomogeneous dynamic capillary pressure forces can cause mechanical damage to the virus. Observed effect of the decrease in the concentration of viable viruses in aqueous sample during evaporation from a solid substrate in experiments confirms our assumption about existence of the physical mechanism [1] .",

The experiments were carried out at room temperature 21-23 \u2022 C. The relative humidity during the preparation of the liquid substance with the virus culture was 40%. The survival rate of the coronavirus culture was evaluated for polypropylene, stainless steel from AISI 304 alloy, copper and cardboard. Thus various domestic and hospital situations were experimentally modeled. Note that the pieces of materials were of arbitrary sizes and thicknesses. The initial concentration of the virus in the biomaterial was 10 3.4 \u2212 10 3.7 or 2500-5000 ml \u22121 . This corresponded to the typical concentrations observed in the upper and lower respiratory tract of a human. Next, a liquid biomaterial with a viral culture in a volume of V d = 50 \u00b5l was applied to the surfaces described above. At certain time intervals, smears were taken from the surfaces and the virus concentration was analyzed. The virus was considered deactivated at that moment in time when its concentration decreased to a value of units per milliliter. Thus, it was experimentally measured that the lifetime of the virus was approximately 50 hours on a plastic substrate, was 24 hours on a cardboard substrate, was 30 hours on a) stainless steel substrate, and was 5 hours on a copper substrate [1] . These results are of great practical importance for epidemiologists in order to reach the effective prevention of the spread of coronavirus [12] .",

The evaporation proceeds faster from more heat-conducting materials and from thinner substrates. However, before quantifying and analyzing the experimental data, two points must be made. For the objectivity of the results we want to exclude copper and cardboard. It is known that copper and its com-pounds possess both antibacterial and antiviral activity [14, 15] . At the same time, such activity is absent in stainless steel [15] . The highest death rate of the virus was observed on a copper substrate, which leads to an assumption, that it can be the result of the occurrence of a cumulative effect, in which the antiviral properties of the material work in conjunction with the effect of liquid evaporation discussed in this paper. It is important to note that the evaporation of a liquid sample occurs most quickly on copper.",

It is this temperature difference that provides thermodynamic force for the liquid evaporation. It is worthy to emphasize that the temperature of the evaporation surface for quasi steady regime is approximately equal to T lim . For further calculations, we need to determine the thickness of the substrate and the evaporating film one. In [1] , unfortunately, the thicknesses of the materials on which the viral substance was applied were not indicated. Therefore, from general considerations about the thicknesses of materials used in everyday life, we will take the thickness of the substrate equal to H = 1 mm.

In [1] , unfortunately, the thicknesses of the materials on which the viral substance was applied were not indicated. Therefore, from general considerations about the thicknesses of materials used in everyday life, we will take the thickness of the substrate equal to H = 1mm. This is, for example, the thickness of a credit card. The characteristic thickness of the liquid layer can be estimated only on the basis of the volume indicated in the article as h \u2248 V 1/3 d = 3.7 mm. We assume that the evaporating liquid is close to some properties of water, for which l w = 0.60 W/(m K), U w = 2.26 MJ/kg. Then for stainless steel substrate (\u03bb s = 16.2 W/(m K)) and polypropylene one (\u03bb s = 0.22 W/(m K)), the evaporation time of a liquid layer with a thickness of 3.7 mm on plastic is equal to 3190 seconds, and on stainless steel is about 1850 seconds. In experiments, the lifetime of the virus on a plastic surface exceeds the lifetime on stainless steel substrate by approximately 1.7 times. Calculated the ratio of evaporation times on different substrates is also 1.7 times. This proportion depends only on the physical properties of materials and their thicknesses. The absolute value of the evaporation time in this case also depends on RH. Evaporation time increases significantly with increasing RH of the surrounding space, see Exp. (5) . No doubts that experiments with dangerous viral substances were carried out in closed volumes during several hours. Thus, liquid evaporation increases humidity in the experimental box. In our case an increase in evaporation time by an order of magnitude can occur if the relative humidity rises from 40 to 85%.",

But we believe that it revealed an important correlation between the rate of evaporation of liquid biological sample and the vitality of coronavirus. It was shown that the main experimental results on the dynamics of coronavirus survival on various surfaces, presented in [1] , correlate well with the rate of isothermal evaporation of liquid samples with viruses on substrates which do not absorb moisture. The evaporation rate depends on the thermal conductivity and thickness of the substrate, as well as the relative humidity of the surrounding air. Ceteris paribus, the viral culture should die faster on more thermally conductive and thinner substrates, as well as in lower relative humidity environment, which provide a higher evaporation rate.",
