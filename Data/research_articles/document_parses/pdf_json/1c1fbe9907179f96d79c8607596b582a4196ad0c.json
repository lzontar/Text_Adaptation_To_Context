Under the normal pathway, patients would attend an outpatient distraction clinic every 1-6 months during which the surgeon/clinical team could discuss these issues, carry out clinical assessments in person and perform a routine rod lengthening.

The surgeon and/or clinical nurse specialists will remain in touch with patients remotely. Some children (Fig. 1) X-ray and clinical assessment when it is safe and practical to do so. Acknowledgement that this is likely to be beyond the timeframe suggested by the MHRA. Titanium blood tests may be a useful surrogate for implant performance (relating to wear/corrosion) in the interim, however, needs further research All MAGEC rods Advise all patients about the possible complications resulting from the failure of components as described in previous FSNs. Each patient should be assessed using own clinical judgement and using X-ray imaging (rather than ultrasound) at least once every 6 months All MAGEC rods Distraction clinic every 3-6 months Distraction interval of every 6 months if possible. Earlier if child experiences mild discomfort will, however, experience mild discomfort indicative that the rod requires lengthening or there may be obvious curve progression; these patients may be seen sooner, and lengthening brought forward. Once the situation returns to normal, surgeons can shorten significantly the gap between lengthenings if needed to catch up with a patient's growth.",

The care of each patient must of course be determined on an individual basis; however, the experience of the authors is that a short delay in scheduled distractions and clinic visits will not adversely impact patient treatment. The authors caution against a gap in distractions of longer than 6 months and emphasise the importance of continued remote patient monitoring to identify those who may need to be seen more urgently.",
