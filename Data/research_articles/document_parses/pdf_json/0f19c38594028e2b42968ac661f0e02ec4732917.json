These are persons forcibly displaced due to persecution or conflict, human rights violations, environmental factors to name a few. Over 84 percent of the refugees are presently hosted by low or middle-income nations with poorer health systems (1). Currently, Uganda hosts the third-largest refugee population in the world, and the largest in Africa. Most of the refugees are from neighbouring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia (2) . By September 2019, the country was hosting around 1.35 million refugees and asylum seekers, mostly in the West Nile, Northern, and Western parts of the country (1). Majority of the refugee population are women and children (82 percent), around 56 percent of refugees are below the age of 15, while 25 percent are younger than 5 years of age (3) .",

Therefore, urban areas are an attractive proposition to these refugees because of prospects for employment, education and access to better infrastructure. Refusal to live in designated rural camps indicates that they preferred to use their skills to achieve sufficiency (8, 9) .

These measures are anticipated to reduce the spread of the virus and complement biomedical interventions. These measures are similar to those of many African countries that have adopted restrictive and combative public health measures aimed at enforcement of severe travel and mobility restrictions (14) . While these measures maybe broadly effective against the pandemic, they carry some risks particularly for vulnerable groups such as urban refugees (15) . As the Covid-19 pandemic magnifies the pre-pandemic issues for various groups including women, minorities and refugees, it can easily intensify discrimination, stigma, poverty, unemployment and gender-based violence for the same. Although such have been a common feature during outbreaks in the past, the modern world, driven by complex political issues and uncontrolled information (circulated via online sources such as, social media) escalates them. For instance, research from the United States of America indicates an upsurge in health care disparities between Blacks and Whites due to differences in exposure to adverse social determinants of health (16) . In addition to cardiovascular risk factors for minorities (Blacks), the low socioeconomic status especially in terms of poor access to quality housing and healthy foods has increased Covid-19 mortality among this group (16) .",

Stark, et al., (2015) state that housing in these areas is congested and inadequate; water and sanitation facilities are communal, and residents collect water from contaminated wetland springs (10) . With restricted movements that have been imposed together with the stringent security measures that have been instituted to enforce adherence to the lockdown and curfew in Kampala, access to such communal sources of water may be further disrupted.

In Uganda, the Ministry of Health has reported some cases of Covid-19 among refugees outside the settlements and some of their contacts (23) .

Urban refugees mainly speak Arabic, French and Swahili which limits their comprehension of the governmental directives, public health messages as well as information, education and communication messages (31) (32) (33) . This exposes them to the risk of getting inaccurate information from peers and networks. It also excludes them from ongoing efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. Yet as argued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), lack of culturally and linguistically accessible information and services related to Covid-19 may increase risks of contracting and spreading the virus among vulnerable populations (20) . Moreover, Uganda's strategic response to the pandemic is based on self-reporting based on the occurrence of symptoms. This is challenging for refugees who already are frightened of approaching health providers and local authorities coupled with limited knowledge of their health rights (31, 34) .",

However, during the lockdown, services of the CSOs were not classified as essential by the governmental decree to lock down non-essential services (36) . For instance, personnel working for most CSOs did not receive special travel permits and the closure of public transport posed an enormous challenge for humanitarian workers, who face increasing travel restrictions (37) .

The lockdown directives did not exonerate these small enterprises and has led to income insecurity (40) . Although this is perceived as a general problem in low and middle-income countries, given the high rate of unemployment in Uganda and it is among countries affected by extreme poverty (Uganda Second National Development Plan 2015-2020), the situation is difficult for refugees who lack contingency livelihoods and social support networks that can serve as shock absorbers and coping resources. Low household income forces poor families to reduce expenditure on essential health items such as food and medicine (39) .

It is estimated that the majority of urban refugees depend on remittances from relatives outside Uganda such as Sweden and the United States of America (9, 41) .

For example, The World Bank (2020) has projected that global remittances are to decline sharply by about 20 percent in 2020 due to the economic crisis induced by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown (43) . The projected fall, is largely caused by fall in the wages and employment of migrant workers, given that they tend to be more susceptible to loss of employment and wages during an economic crisis in a host country (44) .

As in past pandemics, there are clear signs women continue to bear the brunt of emergent risks to public health, safety, and human rights\" (46) . This is because the lockdown has challenged the traditional gender roles in terms of men being the main breadwinners for families. For instance, the closure of markets interrupted the work of male refugees who previously operated as vendors/small scale retailers. Consequently, such a sudden loss of work has resulted in a lack of income to support their children and women under their care (47) . This causes anger and frustration within families which aggravate emotional and physical violence. Lockdowns amidst economic hardships for families are associated with an increase of violence and abuse especially for dependants such as children (46) . Although female refugees would supplement the family income, these regularly work in the traditionally female-dominated informal economy such as braiding hair, washing clothes and tailoring (9; 36). These have however, also been closed during the lockdown but without providing any social protection to mitigate the effects of loss of livelihoods. Social distancing directives also indicate that such workers (i.e. female refugees) are no longer welcome in the places (including households) where they previously worked as casual domestic workers.",

Special cognizance of the plight of the refugees is important given their vulnerability and unique circumstances. A holistic response to this pandemic demands appreciation of the psychosocial and socioeconomic impact of Covid-19 to all vulnerable groups including urban refugees. Sub-optimal attention to the plight of urban refugees during preparedness and response plans for Covid-19 pandemic will not only exacerbate the devastating impacts of Covid-19 to this group but also poses greater risks and challenges to the host communities. This call for embracing the principle of 'leaving no one behind' that is promoted by the United Nations (24).

Some measures can be put in place to address concerns related to the Covid-19 pandemic among urban refugees. Firstly, contingency planning for Uganda must involve refugees with no risk of financial or legal consequences for them. Humanitarian workers should be allowed protected access to the most vulnerable refugees. Working together with local leaders and refugee leaders, they should identify the most vulnerable individual refugees and families. Like vulnerable Ugandans, these should benefit from government assistance in the form of food and other essential items distributed by the National Task Force on Covid-19.Government authorities such as the Kampala Capital City Authority and other municipalities hosting urban refugees should work together with humanitarian organizations such as UNHCR, IOM and UNICEF to ensure continued availability and access to WASH services.",
