Hygiene policy for work areas, medical equipment and supplies SARS-CoV2 is an RNA virus that is wrapped with a fragile external lipid membrane. In general, wrapped viruses are less stable in the environment and are more susceptible to oxidizers such as chlorine. Persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces shows great variability, ranging from about 2 hours to 9 days. Survival time depends on different factors such as surface type, temperature, relative humidity and the specific strain of the virus (World Health Organization, 2020d).

According to the U.S. CDC, sterilization is the process that destroys or eliminates all microscopic life forms and is performed in hospitals or clinics using physical or chemical methods, e.g. dry heat, ethylene oxide gas, steam under pressure, hydrogen peroxide plasma and liquid chemicals. Disinfection is the process that eliminates most or all microorganisms, except bacterial spores on inanimate objects, these are eliminated in health facilities by using chemical liquids or wet pasteurization.
