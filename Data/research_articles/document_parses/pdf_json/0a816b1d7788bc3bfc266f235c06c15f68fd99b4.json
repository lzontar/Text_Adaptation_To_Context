However, although these 65 models have useful analytical properties when analysed over a long time period, they are perform poorly on short time scales. One reason for this is that they are essentially Markovian or 'memoryless'. This means for instance that an individual that has been infected for 10 days has the same probability to clear the infection that someone infected for less than a day.

Having great confidence in both ICU admissions and current ICU occupancy is especially valuable for forecasting hospital needs, while mortality predictions cannot be ignored by decision makers. This first step is only used to locate the closest parameter region from v 0 where likelihoods further calculated might reach their maximum value.Maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and 95%-likelihood intervals (LI) were calculated using the same routine. We assume observed data to be Gaussian-noised realizations of the model prediction, then considering each daily count to be distributed asX obs (t) \u223c N (X sim (t) , X sim (t)),where X sim is the simulated daily count. The choice of the distribution is supported by the large numbers involved and the Poissonian nature of count processes (NB: pre-lock-down mortality data was ignored for the central limit to apply). Contrary to the first step, only one timeseries was used for each estimation. MLE and LI of R 0 , t 0 , E [H], V [H] and \u03ba were estimated with respect to\u00c3, while the other parameter values were set as in v 0 . The resulting MLE of the free parameters replaced the corresponding values in v 0 , providing vector v 1 . This new parameter set served as the starting point to estimate the MLE and LI for E [P], C M and C \u03a8 with respect toL, the derived time series of daily ICU discharges (calculated as the daily ICU admission minus the daily difference in ICU bed occupancy). The resulting parameter set v 2 then initiated the estimation of the remaining parameters, E [\u03a5] and C F , with respect toM , giving vector v 3 .Using the fact that the maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically normally distributed, we used the range of the LI as proxies for the standard deviation of the marginal distribution of each MLE.
