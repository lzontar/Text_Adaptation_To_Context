            "text": "CIRE/mDC-SIGN is a C-type lectin we originally identified as a molecule differentially expressed by mouse dendritic cell (DC) populations. Immunostaining with a CIRE/mDC-SIGN-specific mAb revealed that CIRE/mDC-SIGN is indeed on the surface of some CD4 1 , CD4 \u00ff 8 \u00ff DCs and plasmacytoid pre-DCs, but not on CD8 1 DCs. It has been proposed that CIRE/mDC-SIGN is the functional orthologue of human DC-SIGN (hDC-SIGN), a molecule that both enhances T cell responses and facilitates antigen uptake. We assessed if CIRE/mDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGN exhibit functional similarities. CIRE/mDC-SIGN is down-regulated upon activation, but unlike hDC-SIGN, incubation with IL-4 and IL-13 did not enhance CIRE/mDC-SIGN expression, indicating differences in gene regulation. Like hDC-SIGN, CIRE/mDC-SIGN bound mannosylated residues. However, we could detect no role for CIRE/mDC-SIGN in T cell-DC interactions and the protein did not bind to pathogens known to interact with hDC-SIGN, including Leishmania mexicana, cytomegalovirus, HIV and lentiviral particles bearing the Ebolavirus glycoprotein. The binding of CIRE/mDC-SIGN to hDC-SIGN ligands was not rescued when CIRE/mDC-SIGN was engineered to express the stalk region of hDC-SIGN. We conclude that there are significant differences in the fine specificity of the C-type lectin domains of hDC-SIGN and CIRE/mDC-SIGN and that these two molecules may not be functional orthologues.",

            "text": "Antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) are essential for initiating immune responses because of their unique ability to stimulate naive T lymphocytes (1) . However, DCs are heterogeneous in both their ontogeny and function (2) . In mouse spleen, there exist three major populations of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs): CD4 + CD8 \u00ff (CD4 + DC), CD4 \u00ff CD8 \u00ff (double negative [DN] DC) and CD4 \u00ff CD8 + DC (CD8 + DC) (3) . While there is debate over the haematological origins of these populations (4) (5) (6) , they are functionally distinct. For example, CD8 + DCs are relatively poor stimulators of T cells (7, 8) , and were originally proposed to have a regulatory function (9) . However, if activated, CD8 + and CD8 \u00ff DCs can both induce immune responses (10, 11) , though they preferentially induce T h 1 and T h 2 type responses, respectively (12, 13) . This is in part due to CD8 + DCs being more potent producers of IL-12 (14, 15) . CD8 + DCs have a unique ability to take-up dying cells (16) , and are especially adept at crosspresenting exogenous antigen on class I MHC (17, 18) . Lymph node CD8 + DCs are the most efficient at presenting viral antigen and initiating T cell responses (19) . Finally, DC populations occupy different micro-environments in lymphoid organs (15, 20) , CD8 + DCs tend to concentrate in T cell areas, whereas CD8 \u00ff DCs are found in marginal zones but migrate to T cell areas upon stimulation (21) .",

It also plays a role in the capture, internalisation and presentation of foreign antigen (30) .

To analyse the impact of lectin expression on EBOV-GP-driven infection, the CHO cell lines [CHO cells are permissive to EBOV-GP-dependent entry (41) ] were seeded in 96-well plates and spin infected with EBOV-GP-bearing pseudotypes at 2000 r.p.m. for 2.5 h as described (42) . After overnight incubation, the infection medium was replaced by fresh culture medium and cells cultivated for 3 days before cells were lysed and luciferase activities in cell lysate determined using a commercially available kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). To assess lectin-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 transmission, the CHO cell lines (which are not permissive to HIV-1 infection) were seeded in 96-well plates, incubated with HIV-1 NL4-3luc for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, washed with fresh culture medium and co-cultivated with receptorpositive CEMx174 5.25 M7 cells (43) . Luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined 3 days after the start of the co-culture.",

Indeed, germ-free mice consistently displayed a significant proportion of CIRE/mDC-SIGN + cells in the bone marrow, peritoneal cavity, spleen and blood (Fig. 1D) .

However, when freshly isolated DCs from SPF mice were incubated with various concentrations of IL-4 or IL-13, there was no upregulation of CIRE/mDC-SIGN (Fig. 2B) .

To determine whether the same pathogens can bind CIRE/mDC-SIGN, CHO cells were transfected with vectors that expressed CIRE/mDC-SIGN, hDC-SIGN or the neomycin resistance cassette. The levels of CIRE/mDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGN on the surface of CHO transfectants were measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 5) . While it appears that CHO cells express significantly higher levels of hDC-SIGN than CIRE/ mDC-SIGN, it is important to note that a direct comparison cannot be drawn: expression of both proteins was detected upon staining with different primary mAbs (mouse-derived AZN-1 for hDC-SIGN and rat-derived 5H10 for mDC-SIGN/ CIRE) and corresponding secondary antibodies. However, it is obvious from the use of identical reagents that the levels of CIRE/mDC-SIGN on the cell surface of the transfected CHO cells were significantly higher than ever seen on the surface of native DC (data not shown and Fig. 1A and C) . Surprisingly, CHO cells expressing CIRE/mDC-SIGN did not bind HIV-1, EBOV-GP-bearing pseudotypes, HCMV, MCMV or Leishmania (Fig. 5) , indicating that DCs expressing CIRE/mDC-SIGN should also lack this capacity. By contrast, CHO cells expressing hDC-SIGN did bind these pathogens (Fig. 5) in agreement with previous studies (34, 37, 39, (51) (52) (53) .",

To determine the relative importance of the stalk and the lectin domain in facilitating binding, two chimeric molecules were constructed. The first contained the hDC-SIGN lectin domain fused to the stalk and cytosolic section of CIRE/mDC-SIGN, the second contained the CIRE/mDC-SIGN lectin domain fused to the stalk and cytosolic section of hDC-SIGN. hDC-SIGN, CIRE/mDC-SIGN and the chimeras were efficiently expressed at the cell surface ( Fig. 5A and B) . Again, while direct comparison between the levels of CIRE/mDC-SIGN, hDC-SIGN and the chimeras cannot be drawn, it is clear that the cell-surface levels of CIRE/mDC-SIGN and of the chimera containing the CIRE/mDC-SIGN lectin are significantly higher that seen under physiological conditions on DCs (Fig. 1A  versus 1B) .",

This assay only gave a maximum of 15% of cells showing parasite attachment. However, it was clear that the only cells binding the organisms were those expressing the hDC-SIGN lectin domain (i.e. CHO cells expressing hDC-SIGN and those expressing the chimeric molecule containing the lectin domain of hDC-SIGN and the stalk of CIRE/mDC-SIGN) (Fig. 5C) . These results indicated that the hDC-SIGN lectin was the only essential domain for this interaction. An additional point of interest was that neither promastigotes nor amastigotes of L. major were able to bind to hDC-SIGN, indicating a potentially important host and parasite specificity for this host-pathogen interaction (data not shown).",

            "text": "Human DC-SIGN has been shown to bind many viruses, including EBOV (39, 51) , HIV (52) and HCMV (37) . In accordance with this, EBOV-GP-driven infection of CHO cells expressing hDC-SIGN was at least two logs above control cells (Fig. 5D ). Pre-incubation with mannan strongly reduced EBOV-GP-driven infection of DC-SIGN-expressing cells but not of control cells, indicating that the enhancement of infection was mannose specific and, thus, indicative of hDC-SIGN engagement (data not shown). In contrast, stable expression of CIRE/mDC-SIGN by CHO cells did not enhance infection and this defect could not be rescued by the introduction of the hDC-SIGN stalk (Fig. 5F) . Moreover, the hDC-SIGN chimera containing the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk also failed to enhance infection. The results with HIV-1 and HCMV were comparable to those obtained with EBOV-GP-bearing pseudotypes. Thus, HCMV bound to CHO cells expressing hDC-SIGN but no specific binding was observed with cells expressing CIRE/mDC-SIGN or chimeric lectins (Fig. 5F) . Similarly, only hDC-SIGN-expressing cells transmitted a replication competent HIV-1 reporter virus to permissive cells with appreciable efficiency and in a mannan-sensitive manner, while transmission by cells positive for CIRE/mDC-SIGN or chimeric lectins was inefficient ( Fig. 5E and data not shown) . Binding of MCMV to CIRE/mDC-SIGN was not observed after introduction of the hDC-SIGN stalk (data not shown). To determine whether the stalk of hDC-SIGN did indeed facilitate multimerisation when fused to CIRE/mouse DC-SIGN, or conversely whether the stalk of CIRE/mouse DC-SIGN abolished tetramerisation, we conducted western blot analysis to estimate the sizes of the chimeric proteins expressed by the various transfectants. Proteins in the cell lysate of parental CHO-KI cells that do not express mouse or human DC-SIGN are not detected with the anti-CIRE/mDC-SIGN and antihuman DC-SIGN mAb (Fig. 6; lane 1) . DC-SIGN is a 46-kDa protein containing one N-linked glycosylation site, which is utilised (38) . In accordance with this, under reducing conditions, the predominant product of DC-SIGN (lane 2) resolved at 46 kDa with a minor product detected at~44 kDa (presumed to be non-glycosylated protein). In contrast, under nonreducing conditions, an additional DC-SIGN (lane 2) product was detected at~180 kDa, corresponding to the expected tetramer (184 kDa). The chimeric protein of CIRE/mDC-SIGN lectin fused to hDC-SIGN stalk is expected to be 44 kDa (lane 3) and, accordingly, under reducing conditions a band of 44 kDa was detected. Interestingly, under non-reducing conditions, the predominant product runs at~180 kDa, the expected size (176 kDa) of the tertramerised protein, and only a minor monomeric product is detected at 44 kDa. The second chimera (hDC-SIGN lectin fused to CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk) was expected to be 29 kDa and under reducing conditions a band is indeed detected at 29 kDa (lane 4). However, regardless of whether the cell lysates were run under reducing or non-reducing conditions, no multimer was detected, consistent with the notion that the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk fails to allow multimerisation. In accordance with this, CIRE/mDC-SIGN (27 kDa) failed to multimerise, since an oligomerisation product of CIRE/mDC-SIGN was not detected under nonreducing or reducing conditions. Thus, the stalk of hDC-SIGN does not endow CIRE/mDC-SIGN with the capacity to bind any of the tested viruses, arguing that the mouse lectin has a different binding specificity compared with hDC-SIGN. Furthermore, replacing the stalk of hDC-SIGN with that of CIRE/mDC-SIGN abolished binding to three of the four pathogens analysed, suggesting that hDC-SIGN does indeed require the oligomerisation and spatial orientation facilitated by its long stalk in order to functionally interact with many ligands.",

This suggests that CIRE/mDC-SIGN expression is exquisitely sensitive to activation or mild inflammation induced by microbial exposure.

            "text": "It has been proposed that mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN is the orthologue of hDC-SIGN. Complicating this proposition is the fact that in the mouse there are at least five closely related C-type lectins (CIRE/mDC-SIGN, mSIGNR1-4), all sharing comparable amino acid identity with the two human C-type lectins, hDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGNR (26, 27) . However, since like human DC-SIGN, CIRE/mDC-SIGN is the only mouse DC-SIGN gene that is closely juxtaposed to the CD23 gene, and is the only mouse lectin expressed in DCs, it was concluded to be the hDC-SIGN orthologue. In this report, using a mAb against mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN, we show that its expression pattern has some similarity to that of hDC-SIGN. Mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN is expressed on freshly isolated splenic, thymic and lymph node DCs; unfortunately, these tissue sources have not been used for isolation of human DCs. However, CIRE/mDC-SIGN can be detected on monocyte-derived DCs (data not shown) and macrophages and hDC-SIGN is expressed on monocyte-derived DCs, monocyte-derived Langerhans cells, CD1a lo dermal DCs and macrophage subsets (28, 49, (55) (56) (57) . In the mouse, CIRE/mDC-SIGN is also on the cell surface of spleen pDCs; notably, there are reports of its expression on human pDCs, but the data are conflicting (49, 55) . Interestingly, mouse blood monocytes express CIRE/mDC-SIGN, whereas human monocytes do not express DC-SIGN (28, 55, 56) . There maybe some parallels between the down-regulation of CIRE/mDC-SIGN on freshly isolated mouse DCs when activated with CpG ( Fig. 2) LPS, IFN-c and poly-IC (data not shown) and the reduction observed when human monocyte-derived DCs are 'matured' with factors such as LPS, prostaglandin E 2 and tumour necrosis factor-a (28, 55) . However, there are clearly differences in gene regulation in response to IL-4 and IL-13. Freshly isolated mouse DCs do not up-regulate CIRE/mDC-SIGN in the presence of IL-4 and IL-13, whereas hDC-SIGN, on monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages, is up-regulated in the presence of IL-4 and IL-13 (48, 49) . It remains to be seen whether this is a difference between the different types of DCs studied, or whether it is a species difference between mouse and man.",

The key issue to be addressed was whether CIRE/mDC-SIGN is indeed a functional orthologue of hDC-SIGN. Human DC-SIGN binds ICAM-3 and has been proposed to help initiate interactions between DCs and T cells (28) , though this observation has been challenged recently (57) . In an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction, both CIRE/ mDC-SIGN + DCs and CIRE/mDC-SIGN \u00ff DCs induced comparable levels of T cell proliferation, arguing that this lectin in the mouse plays, at best, only a minor role in T cell activation and aligns our finding with that of Granelli-Piperno et al. (57) . Another role proposed for hDC-SIGN is antigen capture and presentation (30, 31) . A similar function has been proposed for CIRE/mDC-SIGN (50) and more directly shown for the homologue mSIGNR1, a C-type lectin expressed in marginal zone macrophages, which takes up blood-borne polysaccharide antigens (44) (45) (46) (47) . Our data showing that CIRE/mDC-SIGN binds mannosylated FITC-BSA in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 3) demonstrates that this molecule is also a C-type lectin with mannose-binding specificity. However, despite the common mannose-binding function, and despite the fact that CIRE/mDC-SIGN transfectants expressed significantly higher levels of CIRE/mDC-SIGN than physiologically found on mouse DCs, they did not interact appreciably with HIV-1, virion-associated EBOV-GP, HCMV or L. mexicana, pathogens that have been documented to interact with hDC-SIGN (34, 37, 39, (51) (52) (53) .",

            "text": "In order to reconcile this discrepancy, we focused on the region that differs most significantly between the human and mouse molecule, namely the stalk region that supports the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). In hDC-SIGN, the stalk has seven and a half tandem repeats that give rise to an alpha helix, which is involved in the tetramerisation of the CRD (54). The oligomerisation caused by the stalk has two functions. The first function is to create a unique spatial arrangement between the individual CRDs and thus contribute to their ligand specificity. In the case of hDC-SIGN, it has been shown that this lectin specifically interacts with the trimannose motif in high mannose oligosaccharides and that these carbohydrates need to be spaced some distance apart to interact with multiple CRDs (53, 54, (58) (59) (60) . This differs from the mannose-binding receptor, which binds terminal mannose residues (54) . The second function of oligomerisation is to facilitate multivalent interaction and thus enhance avidity (54, 61) . In the mouse, CIRE/mDC-SIGN does not have the tandem repeats or motifs that allow tetramer formation and we reasoned that this deficiency could contribute to its inability to bind the pathogens that hDC-SIGN bound. However, when the N-terminus of hDC-SIGN was fused to the mouse CIRE/ mDC-SIGN CRD, the chimeric molecule failed to bind the pathogens tested despite having the capacity to multimerise (Fig. 6) , arguing that the mouse CRD, even when endowed with the oligomerisation domain, is unable to recognise the same ligands as hDC-SIGN. When the hDC-SIGN CRD was fused to the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk, and thus lost its capacity to oligomerise (Fig. 6) , it could no longer bind HIV-1, HCMV or EBOV-GP-bearing pseudotypes, suggesting that multivalent engagement is indeed required for binding. Indeed, the requirement for multimerisation of hDC-SIGN for the binding of HIV-1 envelope protein has been previously reported (62) . Thus, for the binding of viruses, CIRE/mDC-SIGN differs from its human orthologue with respect to the function of the both CRD and the stalk region. Interestingly, the chimeric molecule containing the human DC-SIGN lectin fused to the CIRE/mDC-SIGN stalk, could still bind L. mexicana promastigotes, indicating that this interaction is independent of the tetramerisation of hDC-SIGN.",

They share highly significant identity at the amino acid level, and both CTLDs do have the capacity to bind mannosylated molecules.

Moreover, their evolutionary relatedness is evidenced by their chromosomal location, with both genes being tightly linked to CD23, in the mouse and human genomes. However, we consistently failed to demonstrate binding of mouse CIRE/mDC-SIGN to any of the hDC-SIGN ligands tested. Supporting our observation, CIRE/mDC-SIGN failed to bind Candida albicans and Escherichia coli (50), whereas hDC-SIGN has been shown to bind these pathogens (63, 64) . Furthermore, even among the closely related CIRE/mDC-SIGN and mouse SIGNR1-4 lectins, there are distinct recognition patterns for microbes despite the conserved EPN (mannose recognition) motif (50) . Thus, the CTLDs of hDC-SIGN and CIRE/mDC-SIGN, although endowed with similar carbohydrate specificities, differ in their abilities to interact with pathogens, suggesting that the fine specificity of the CTLDs of hDC-SIGN and CIRE/mDC-SIGN are significantly different and that they may not be simple functional orthologues. The question whether there are other yet to be defined, functional similarities between these two molecules will only be resolved by the identification of CIRE/ mDC-SIGN-specific ligands. ",

Cultures were pulsed at the end of the incubation period with 1 lCi per well of [ 3 H]thymidine for 6 h, harvested onto glass-fibre filters and thymidine incorporation was counted by liquid scintillation. Five replicates of all cultures were done. Generating constructs CIRE/mDC-SIGN and hDC-SIGN cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRV restriction site of the pIRES-Neo plasmid (Clonetech, Heidelberg, Germany). Briefly, CIRE/mDC-SIGN cDNA was amplified from previously isolated clones (26) using the PCR and Pwo polymerase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) under standard amplification conditions: 25 cycles: 94\u00b0, 30 s; 55\u00b0, 30 s; 72\u00b0, 1 min. The primers used in this reaction were: CIRE/ mDC-SIGN-For primer 59-TAG TAG ATA TCG GCG CGC CTC ACT TGC TAG GGC AGG A and -Rev primer 59-TAG TAG ATA TCG GCG CGC CTG AAA CAT GAG TGA TTC TAA G. Similarly, hDC-SIGN was amplified from cDNA derived from human DCs, using primers designed from published sequences (34): hDC-SIGN-For primer 59-TAG TAG ATA TCT GGG GTG ACA TGA GTG AC and DC-SIGN-Rev primer 59-TAG TAG ATA TCT ACG CAG GAG GGG GGT TT.",
