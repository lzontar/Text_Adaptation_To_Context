However, the collection of follow-up specimens was sub-optimal, as only 74% of expected follow-up specimens were obtained and mid-turbinate swabs were more often obtained than throat swabs. We speculate that illness-related absenteeism and the complex, irregular work schedules of participants impeded collection of study specimens.

However, we and others have shown that the yield from midturbinate self-swabs compares favorably with the yield of swabs obtained by research staff. 6, 7 Also, our ARI case definition may have captured non-viral entities such as allergic rhinitis, bacterial sinusitis, and bacterial pharyngitis.",
