Rayleigh-Benard thermal convection is the physical principle that as an aqueous solution is heated, it becomes less dense and rises due to gravity, whereas, in contrast, a colder solution is denser and falls. In the Donut PCR platform, we designed a chip that includes an annular (donut-shaped) reaction chamber in which the DNA sample and PCR reagents are loaded. The chip is then sealed and vertically mounted on one side to a 95 \u2218 C heater and on the other side to a 60 \u2218 C heater (Fig. 1ab) . Fluid in the reaction chamber is heated at the 95 \u2218 C zone and rises to the top of the chamber where it is carried by momentum to the 60 \u2218 C zone. The fluid is then cooled at the 60 \u2218 C zone, and falls to the bottom of the chamber, where it is carried by momentum to the 95 \u2218 C zone, thus completing the thermal cycle. On the inner surface of the reaction chamber of the chip, we print a pre-quenched DNA microarray (Fig. 1c) to allow highly multiplexed probe-based readout. Microarrays allow detection of up to hundreds of thousands of different nucleic acid targets using a single fluorescence channel [5, 6] by spatially separating different probes. However, traditional microarrays are unsuitable for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use because they require labor-intensive and open-tube wash steps to suppress fluorescence background. The team has developed a new pre-quenched microarray chemistry, in which unlabeled amplicons induce an increase of the corresponding spot's fluorescence via displacement of a quencher-functionalized oligonucleotide. Because the PCR amplicons are unlabeled, no wash steps are needed to reduce fluorescent background from excess amplicons, and a highly multiplexed readout for many different DNA targets can be achieved in a closed tube reaction without specialized opto-fluidic equipment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1138, "end": 1141, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1144, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 521, "end": 531, "text": "(Fig. 1ab)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 950, "end": 959, "text": "(Fig. 1c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Once the loaded chip is mounted against the heaters, the PCR reaction begins, and an external camera is used to periodically take pictures of the microarray area ( Fig. 1d ).

This real-time readout allows robust and accurate DNA target quantitation based on the time at which the fluorescence significantly increases.

(c) Pictures of the Donut PCR chip (360 m thick chamber) loaded with red dye to visualize fluid circulation. (d) Donut PCR sensitivity and dynamic range. As with qPCR, the observed Donut PCR spot fluorescence follows a sigmoidal curve. Here, we show fluorescence traces for amplification of human genomic DNA from 20 pg (10 copies) to 200 ng (10 5 copies). The time at which the fluorescence crosses a threshold value (Tt) is dependent on the log of the input DNA concentration, as expected. (e) Simultaneous amplification and quantitation of mixed samples of human and mouse genomic DNA. We designed primers and probes for the human TFRC gene and the mouse Nono gene, and quantitated each gene for samples wherein the human DNA was fixed at 1,000 copies and mouse DNA varied from 100 to 12,800 copies. The Tt values for human TFRC were unaffected by the changes in the mouse DNA concentration. See Supplementary Section S6 for additional data. (f) Sample fluorescence images of experiments shown in panel (e). The mouse probe (left spot) became brighter at earlier times when a larger amount of mouse DNA was used as input.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "Spot position independence, established through redundant real-time detection of multiple genes. (a) Chip layout. Out of 48 spots, 3 were used as positive and negative controls (PC and NC), 15 spots were used for 5-fold replicate detection of 3 human genes (H1, H2, and H3), 15 spots for 3 rat genes (R1, R2, and R3), and 15 spots for 3 mouse genes (M1, M2, and M3). (b) Sample fluorescence image at t = 30 min when 4 ng of human gDNA was loaded as input, using PCR primers for all 9 genes (including 3 rat and 3 mouse). Only the human and positive control spots were bright, as expected. There is variation in the endpoint brightness of different probes due to both uneven illumination and due to differences in fluorophore coupling and probe spotting efficiency. (c) Time-course fluorescence traces for all 9 sets of probe spots. Threshold times are generally consistent across the 5-fold replicate spots.
