As a result of the increasing multimodality of social networks, there are more and more multimodal data which combine images and texts in social platforms. Though providing great conveniences for people communication, multimodal data bring growing challenges for social media analytics. In fact, it is often the case that the sentiment cannot be reflected with the support of single modality information. The motivation is to leverage the varieties of information from multiple sources for building an efficient model. This paper studies the task of sentiment analysis for social media, which contains both visual and textual contents. Sentiment analysis is a core task of natural language processing, and aims to identify sentiment polarity towards opinions, emotions, and evaluations. Traditional methods [14, 21] for text-only sentiment analysis are mainly statistical methods which highly rely on the quality of feature selection. With the rapid development of machine learning techniques and deep neural network, researchers introduce many dedicated methods [7, 13] , which achieve significantly improved results.

Nevertheless, the co-memory network only applies a weighted textual/visual vector as the guide to learn attention weights on visual/textual representation.

CNNs have been observed that they are capable of extracting the informative n-gram features as sentence representations [10] . Thus, the convolution mechanism is quite suitable for the extraction task in the multimodal sentiment classification.

The marker refers to p-value < 0.01 when comparing with MultiSentiNet, while the marker refers to p-value < 0.01 when comparing with CoMN(6). The results of both two ablations of FENet in accuracy and F1 are inferior to those of FENet variants. On the one hand, after removing the interactive information extraction layer, FENet cannot capture the interrelations between image and text, which are significant for sentiment analysis. Specifically, the performance of FENet w/o IIF degrades more than FENet w/o SIE by 2.0% of accuracy in MVSA-Single and 1.5% of accuracy in MVSA-Multiple. It verifies that the visual-specific textual representation and the textual-specific visual representation bring useful information for sentiment classification. On the other hand, FENet w/o SIE removes the SIE layer from FENet and only contains the IIF layer, which achieves better performances than CoMN. It is suggested that fine-grained attention can capture more specific information than coarse-grained attention. Furthermore, the SIE component also plays a key role in our model. FENet-Glove outperforms FENet w/o SIE in two datasets by 1.3% and 0.7% of accuracy respectively, which demonstrates that the SIE layer can exert significant effects after integrated with the IIF layer.
