It is unclear 44 how the human immune system responds to this infection. Here, we used 45 metatranscriptomic sequencing to profile immune signatures in the bronchoalveolar 46 lavage fluid of eight COVID-19 cases. The expression of proinflammatory genes, 47 especially chemokines, was markedly elevated in COVID-19 cases compared to 48 community-acquired pneumonia patients and healthy controls, suggesting that 49 SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercytokinemia. Compared to SARS-CoV, which is 50 thought to induce inadequate interferon (IFN) responses, SARS-CoV-2 robustly 51 triggered expression of numerous IFN-inducible genes (ISGs). These ISGs exhibit 52 immunopathogenic potential, with overrepresentation of genes involved in 53 inflammation. The transcriptome data was also used to estimate immune cell 54 populations, revealing increases in activated dendritic cells and neutrophils.",

Meanwhile, viruses have developed strategies to counteract 78 IFNs. For example, SARS-CoV can efficiently suppress IFN induction and antagonize 79 IFN's effect by harnessing its structural and non-structural proteins (de Wit et al., 80 2016). SARS-CoV infection failed to induce competent IFN response in cultured cells 81 (Cheung et al., 2005; Spiegel and Weber, 2006; Ziegler et al., 2005) and SARS 82 patients (Reghunathan et al., 2005). The inadequate IFN response may account for the 83 4 progressive increase of viral load in SARS patients, the concomitant 84 hypercytokinemia, and the ultimate fatal outcomes. 85 Clinical study on COVID-19 suggested the hypercytokinemia in severe cases (Huang 86 et al., 2020). However, a more comprehensive investigation of the host immune 87 response is needed. Here, we collected the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 88 eight COVID-19 patients, 146 community-acquired pneumonia patients, and 20 89 healthy controls, followed by metatranscriptome sequencing and functional analysis.",

The demographic and clinical 100 characteristics of the cohorts were detailed in Table S1 .

Among them, 56% of the reads could be mapped to the 103 human genome and were used for further analysis. As metatranscriptome data enabled 104 us to capture the transcriptionally active microbes, we further classified CAP into two 105 categories: Virus-like CAP (determined by at least 100 viral reads and 10-fold higher 106 than those in the negative controls) and Non-viral CAP.

Several genes were regulated in 167 the \"Interleukin\" and \"Tumor necrosis factor\" categories, and few were modulated in 168 other categories (Figure 2A ). To examine potential cytokine expression dynamics, we 169 aligned individual cases according to the increasing days between sampling and 170 symptom onset. Expression levels of cytokine-related genes seem to decrease over 171 time, with one patient (C4) who eventually deceased being the outlier (Figure 2A ). (Table S2) 187 exhibited the most pronounced chemokine upregulation ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that 188 higher virus replication resulted in a more robust proinflammatory response.",

Severe cases often developed acute 62 lung injury, or the fatal form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Chen et al., 63 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). To date, no specific antiviral treatment 64 is available for COVID-19. 65 The infection of certain respiratory viruses often resulted in a robust inflammatory 66 response (de Jong et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2005). This immune dysregulation, 67 termed as hypercytokinemia or \"cytokine storm\", is often associated with detrimental 68 outcomes, such as ARDS (de Jong et al., 2006). To date, it remains elusive how 69 pathogen infections disrupt the host immune homeostasis and stimulate a hyperactive 70 proinflammatory response. A proposed model suggested that viral evasion of the 71 innate immune response plays a critical role (D'Elia et al., 2013): the virus can 72 effectively blind the immune system, causing an inadequate or delayed response; this 73 immune escape gives rise to the unrestrained virus replication, which eventually 74 results in a hyperactivated proinflammatory response.",

CXCL8, the archetypal 180 neutrophil chemoattractant, together with CXCL and CXCL2, are upregulated (Figure 181 2B). These chemokines are thought to be critical for recruiting neutrophils into the 182 flamed lung (Donnelly et al., 1993; Frevert et al., 1995; Miller et al., 1992). CXCR2, 183 the receptor for CXCL8, CXCL1, and CXCL2, is also markedly upregulated (Figure 184 2B).

Because IL-1\u03b2 was recognized 198 as the key cytokine driving proinflammatory response in BALF from patients with 199 ARDS (Pugin et al., 1996), it is possible that the ratio of IL-1\u03b2 to its inhibitor, IL-1Ra, 200 may correlate to inflammation intensity in COVID-19 patients; however, we did not 201 observe clear correlation in the current study (Figure 2B). 202 Signatures of IFN response 203 We then examined the IFN response in COVID-19 patients.

Moreover, we 214 observed the increased expression of IFIH1, TANK, IRF7, and STAT1, which may 215 further potentiate IFN signaling (Figure 3B). 216 Other than antiviral, ISGs may exert diverse functions. We assigned these ISGs to five 217 previously established functional clusters (Mostafavi et al., 2016), including RNA 218 processing (C1 and C2), IFN regulation/antiviral function (C3), metabolic regulation 219 (C4), and inflammation regulation (C5)",

ISGs identified in infections of yellow fever virus (live attenuated 229 vaccine), HCV, EBV, and dengue virus were primarily assigned to C3 with less 230 involvement of C5, while SARS-CoV-2 exhibited overly high C5 distribution (Figure 231 3C, Table S4).

Using the transcriptome data, we estimated 238 immune cell types and their proportions by CIBERSORT (Newman et al., 2015). 239 Similar to findings in BALF from healthy adults (Meyer et al., 2012), the BALF cell 240 components in Healthy were mainly macrophages and lymphocytes (Figure 4A). This 241 result supported the accuracy of the BALF cell sequencing and the effectiveness of 242 our analytical approach. Among innate immune cells, activated dendritic cells, 243 activated mast cells, and neutrophils were more abundant in viral pneumonia groups 244 than those in Healthy (Figure 4B). SARS2 showed a more pronounced increase in 245 neutrophils than other pneumonia (Figure 4B). Compared to innate immune cells, the 246 composition of T cells and B cells was less varied among pneumonia groups and 247 Healthy (Figure S3A). A recent study suggested that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 248 (NLR) ratio was associated with the disease severity of COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020).",

Moreover, although robust ISG induction was observed, we failed 288 to detect significant upregulation of IFNs. This discrepancy needs further 289 investigation. 290 IFN-I could also be pathogenic. In the mouse model, depletion of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 291 protects mice from lethal infection of SARS-CoV (Channappanavar et al., 2016). 292 Moreover, delayed IFN-\u03b2 treatment failed to inhibit virus replication and aggravated 293 pulmonary inflammation in the mice infected with MERS-CoV (Channappanavar et 294 al., 2019). These data suggested that the timing of IFN therapy against SARS and 295MERS is critical. In the ISGs identified in COVID-19 cases, we found a subset of 296 genes with proinflammatory activities, which is relatively underrepresented in other 297 viral infections. These \"proinflammatory ISGs\" may assist the antiviral protection by 298 amplifying inflammatory signals to the environment. However, they could also be 299 deleterious in infections, especially when hypercytokinemia has already been 300 triggered. As IFN treatment has been adopted as an antiviral therapy against 301 SARS-CoV-2 infection (ChiCTR2000029600), the timing and dose should be 302 carefully considered.",
