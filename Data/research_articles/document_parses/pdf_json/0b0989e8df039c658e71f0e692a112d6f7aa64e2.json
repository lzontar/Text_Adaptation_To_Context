We have a rather simplistic view on this. One reason for high number cases in the US, Italy, and the likes could be that the citizens live mostly indoors in air-conditioned houses and offices. There may be no fresh air ventilation in homes and offices. They are forced to breathe the same air or they keep touching fomites polluted with the virus all the time. Could this be increasing transmission despite the higher population density in India? It does seem that closed surroundings may help the virus survive for much longer, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected even after up to 17 days of evacuation from cabins of diamond princess cruise ship. [7] Based on these facts, in addition to viral testing, quarantine, sanitizing, etc., opening windows and keeping doors open to fresh air in all the premises may be critical to reduce viral transmission. There are also data showing relation of severity of disease with higher viral load, similarly, it is possible that a higher titer exposure to the virus in a closed environment leads to adverse clinical outcome.
