The former means that the infection is due to direct inhalation of the patient's sneezing, coughing and talking droplets; the latter means that a person can be infected by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly eyes. The dental papers show that aerosol transmission is a possible transmission routes in dental clinic, because many dental procedures produce aerosol and droplets that are contaminated with virus (Peng et al., 2020; Wei & Li, 2016) . Because of the extremely high possibility of producing a large number of aerosols and diffusing into the surrounding air during the dental procedures, the Chinese governments have introduced a series of policies to guide the work of oral clinic, as the key of cross-infection protection. At present in China, most oral medical institutions only retain oral emergency services, mainly to deal with oral and maxillofacial trauma, acute pulpitis, oral bleeding and other emergencies (Zhang & Jiang, 2020) .

According to the patient's epidemiological history, blood analysis, chest CT and other examinations, for those who can be excluded the COVID-19 infection, should be issued a medical certificate confirming that it is suitable to continue to visit the oral clinic, and then specialized diagnosis and treatment of oral mucosal disease can continue. For those patients who are highly suspected or cannot rule out COVID-19 infection should be isolated immediately and treated for emergency according to the threelevel protection standard after the patient's condition is stable.",

During the COVID-19 epidemic, due to changes in social-life environment and increased work pressure, it is possible to cause disorders of the body's immune function, leading to the acute attack of oral mucosa disease, or the acute recurrence of some chronic oral mucosa dis-ease (Society of Oral Mucosal Diseases & Chinese StomatologicalAssociation, 2020). Common acute oral mucosa disease mainly refers to the performance of large areas of erosion and ulceration, difficult to self-healing, severe pain, seriously affecting the normal life of patients, and even life threatening, such as allergic diseases, infectious diseases, erosive oral lichen planus (EOLP), major/herpetiform aphthous ulcers, pemphigus, and so on. Some of the acute diseases above often accompanied by fever and some systemic symptoms, which is difficult to identify with COVID-19 just through the consultation. This also poses an unprecedented challenge to oral medicine physician. Hence, we summarize the treatment measures and suggestions for acute oral mucosal disease during the outbreak, for reference by oral emergency physician and patients (Figure 1).",
