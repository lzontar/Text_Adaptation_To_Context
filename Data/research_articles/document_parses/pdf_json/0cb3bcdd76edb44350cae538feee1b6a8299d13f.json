Abou Alaiwa, M.D. Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA Airways evolved with multiple host defense mechanisms to protect against invading organisms (1) (2) (3) (4) . At the interface with the environment is a thin layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) equipped with antimicrobial factors that rapidly kill bacteria and mucus that rapidly clears trapped pathogens (5) . Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by recurrent bacterial airway infections, accumulation of mucus, inflammation, and progressive decline in lung function. Despite advances in antibiotic formulations and mucus mobilization maneuvers, CF lung disease continues as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF (6) . Development of the CF pig and other animal models has added understanding of the pathogenesis of early CF airway disease (7, 8) . At birth, CF pig lungs show no inflammation or infection but demonstrate a bacterial host defense defect. Over time, CF pigs spontaneously develop the hallmark features of CF airway disease with infection, inflammation, airway obstruction and airway remodeling (9) . We examined CF pigs within hours of birth and discovered two host defense defects. First, CF ASL is abnormally acidic, which inhibits the activity of antimicrobial peptides and proteins (10) . This low ASL pH not only affects the antimicrobial activity of individual antimicrobial factors, but also their synergistic interactions (11) . Second, impaired anion secretion by CF submucosal glands alters mucus biophysical properties so that mucus remains anchored to the submucosal gland ducts and fails to break free. The accumulation of mucus hinders mucociliary transport (12) . These defects initiate the cascade of CF airway pathology and may be targets for early therapeutic intervention. CF treatment is being revolutionized by therapies that directly target defective CFTR. Drug discovery is accelerating as high-throughput screening becomes more efficient, compound libraries expand, and novel approaches are tried. But it is still necessary to test potential drugs in humans, and human testing has not accelerated. Moreover, as the health of CF subjects improves because of increasingly effective symptomatic treatments, traditional metrics such as assessments of lung function become less sensitive, requiring larger and longer trials.",

We are now measuring C-and M-sweating in a cohort of healthy subjects (3 tests of ~50 glands in each subject) and will determine if their rates correlate with CFTR transcript levels from nasal brushings and, in selected individuals, the DNA sequence of CFTR.

Mean M-and C-sweat rates varied 5-and 12-fold respectively across subjects. M rates significantly predicted C rates (R=0.84, p < 0.0001). Importantly, C/M ratios, which reflect CFTR function, varied over a 5-fold range and were independent of M-sweat rates (for C/M vs M, R=0.02, p=0.92). Setting the mean C/M ratio of this group equal to 100% wild-type (WT) function gave mean values for individuals ranging from 37\u00b111% to 190\u00b118% WT (mean and SD across 3 tests with 30-50 identified glands per test). We also tested two CF carriers in the same way. Their responses were 64\u00b132% and 32\u00b13% of WT. An alternative way to normalize the data is to set the largest responder = 100% CFTR function. The remaining control population then had C/M values that were 17-82% of the maximum value with a mean near 50%. The range of values is similar to that reported for full length transcripts, but is shifted lower than expected.",

Removal of inhaled materials requires the efficient movement of the mucus layer atop the ciliated airway surface. The clearance of the mucus layer from airway surfaces is critically dependent on the proper hydration of the two layers that together comprise the airway surface liquid (ASL), the mucus layer and the underlying periciliary layer (PCL) which acts as a lubricating layer in which the cilia beat. However, abnormalities in the mucus clearance system characterize a number of airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma. The pathogenesis of these diseases is multi-factorial, but have a common disease-initiating step: a reduction of mucus clearance. The failure to regulate the hydration of both layers, and its relationship to disease, is most apparent in CF, where dysregulation of ion transport produces increased fluid absorption, dehydration of both the mucus and PCL layers, and reduction of both mucociliary clearance (MCC) and cough clearance (CC).",

We hypothesize that concentrated mucus is more adherent to the airway surface, limiting the ability of cilia (MCC) and airflow (CC) to propel the mucus out of the lung. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a series of novel devices/techniques to quantify the magnitude of interaction between the mucus layer and underlining airway epithelial surfaces, using non-CF and CF primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures, containing endogenous mucus with concentrations spanning from normal (1-2% solids) to CF (>8% solids). Our data, presented here, demonstrate that the adhesion of the mucus to the cell surface increased exponentially when mucus concentration increased to values associated with CF. Further, we observed that when mucus becomes concentrated, the force that it takes to propel mucus across the airway surface (ie, the friction) increased significantly, which likely contributes to the reduction in the ability of cilia and airflow to clear the adherent mucus layer in CF.",

Secretion of new mucus into a solution of ~100 mM bicarbonate normalizes this mucus phenotype. The reverse, removing bicarbonate from the tissue rendered wild-type mucus attached. We have learnt that in contrast to the general understanding, when the MUC2 mucin is secreted it normally remains anchored to the goblet cells. The release of the mucin in the small intestine requires a protease, meprin \u03b2, to cleave the MUC2 N-terminus (2) . Meprin \u03b2 was released into the CF mucus and addition of recombinant meprin \u03b2 did not release the anchored mucus. Based on these studies it was suggested that the mucin needs to be properly unfolded, as mediated by bicarbonate, to allow access for meprin \u03b2 to the cleavage site in the MUC2 mucin.",

In contrast, the mucus that emerged from the submucosal glands of tracheas from newborn CF pigs failed to break free and remained anchored at the submucosal gland duct. Blocking fluid and HCO 3 secretion in the non-CF trachea produced a CF-like pattern of entangled strands, suggesting the defect in mucus secreted from the CF trachea resulted from alterations in fluid and electrolyte secretion in the submucosal gland.

Treatment of F508del CFTR has been much more complex, in part due to its multiple cellular defects, but also because corrector therapy is inherently less efficacious. While corrector monotherapy with the investigational CFTR corrector lumacaftor (formerly VX-809) can restore partial CFTR function in patients homozygous for F508del, it does not exhibit therapeutic benefit until the sequential addition of ivacaftor is added to the regimen, suggesting the importance of addressing both prominent cellular abnormalities; moreover, improved spirometry was only observed with addition of ivacaftor to lumacaftor therapy, even though further improvements in CFTR function were not observed. 1 Recently, the potential deleterious effects of ivacaftor on F508del thermal stability and membrane residence time has been described, and has been postulated to explain suboptimal therapeutic benefits observed with ivacaftor-lumacaftor co-therapy. 2, 3 However, these in vitro results relied on measures of ion transport to assess CFTR activity and do not adequately explain apparent clinical findings, which emphasize the benefit of potentiator therapy when added to the regimen. Resolving this conundrum is imperative, since multi-agent CFTR modulator therapy is on the horizon; further, assays that rely on use of primary human epithelial cells have been proposed to help guide use of personalized therapeutic regimen for the individualized treatment of CF including those with rare genetic alleles.",

To address this, our laboratories have developed micro-optical coherence tomography (\u03bcOCT), a high-speed, high-resolution imaging modality that allows for simultaneous evaluation of epithelial function microanatomy in situ, and in living tissue. 4 This technology enables new assessments of mechanism, and may better predict the success of therapeutics that target epithelial function since measurements of mucociliary transport and effective mucus viscosity can be readily acquired, and may dissociate with measures of ion transport alone. 5 These analyses provide insight into the mechanisms by which therapeutic benefit of corrector-potentiator therapy is conferred to CF patients, and provide a more complete assessment of complex CFTR modulator regimens, suggesting the potential for predicting clinical response on an individualized basis.",

A CFTR corrector (lumacaftor) and a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor) for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who have a phe508del CFTR mutation: a phase 2 randomised controlled trial. The Lancet. Respiratory medicine. Jul 2014;2(7):527-538. As people with CF survive longer, greater focus has been brought on extra-pulmonary disease in CF (1) (2) (3) (4) . Emerging data highlight the role of the gut microbiota in influencing gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI health outcomes for people with lung disease including CFthe \"Lung-Gut Axis\" (5) (6) (7) (8) . The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has been shown to alter the gut microbiota in non-CF populations, and importantly the potential overgrowth of C. difficile resulting in C. difficile infection (CDI) and pseudomembranous colitis (9, 10) . With increasing survival in patients with CF there is an associated increasing cumulative antibiotic exposure in this cohort (11) , which coincides with a temporal increase in C. difficile carriage rate in CF using culture-dependent techniques, with recent reported rates of up to 47% (1, 6, (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) , compared to 1.1% -15% in healthy adults (17) (18) (19) . To date, variable carriage rates and presence of toxin in stool do not explain why CDI in people with CF pre-transplant is rare (1, (12) (13) (14) 17, 20) , consensus on screening is lacking, how or when to treat C. difficile in CF remains unclear, and there is only emerging data regarding antibiotic susceptibility of C. difficile strains cultured from patients with CF to examine for the devel-opment of resistant C. difficile strains. To complement these issues, original work from Cork Adult CF Center will be presented where patients attending the CF centre were assessed for carriage of C. difficile, presence of C. difficile toxin, ribotypes and antibiotic susceptibility with results correlated with CF patient clinical parameters, and a same-site healthy volunteer group. C. difficile was isolated from stool samples in 50% (n=30) of patients with CF and 2% (n=2) of healthy volunteers; 63% (n=19) of C. difficile culture-positive samples in patients with CF were toxin-positive. All C. difficile strains isolated from toxin-positive stool samples carried toxin genes, tcdA and tcdB. PCR ribotyping of the C. difficile isolates revealed 16 distinct ribotypes. Eleven toxigenic ribotypes were detected, including a hypervirulent ribotype and most commonly 046 (21) . Univariate and subsequent multivariate logistic regression analyses identified no significant associations between C. difficile and recorded clinical variables. Interestingly four of the ribotypes reported in this study have appeared in the top five most prevalent disease-causing ribotypes reported in our country in the last four years: RT002, RT014, RT015, and RT078. This highlights the importance of hand hygiene policy and the institution of source isolation of patients with CF. Studies using a highly discriminatory typing scheme to identify and track the transmission of C. difficile in patients with CF are required to inform best practice with regard to infection control policy in this area. All isolates from patients with CF were susceptible to both metronidazole and vancomycin (22) , suggesting these antibiotics are highly effective for the treatment of C. difficile in people with CF.",

Traditional treatment approaches, such as probiotics (23) or faecal microbiota transplant (24) , have shown benefit in a non-CF population, but these are untested in a CF population. While C. difficile carriage is not an exclusion criterion for lung transplant, eradication of C. difficile in patients awaiting transplant may prove beneficial as the presence of C. difficile may act as a relative deterrent to transplant programs in patient selection. Finally, eradication of C. difficile from the CF gut may allow a more diverse and, therefore, more healthy GI flora, which may impact on lung health via the \"Lung-Gut Axis.\"",

Frequent antibiotic therapy to treat pulmonary infections, in addition to the inherent effect of CFTR dysfunction on the gastrointestinal tract, have been proposed as possible causes of this dysbiosis in the gut microbiota of people with CF (4). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that CFTR genotype may also contribute to altered gut microbiota, with those who were \u0394F508 homozygotes having a more dysbiotic gut microbiota within the CF study cohort (33) . A study examining the development of the gut and lung microbiome in paediatrics with CF revealed both microbial communities develop simultaneously and share a number of colonising species. It was also revealed that the appearance of some species in the gut can presage their appearance in the lungs, suggesting the gut microbiota may help shape the development of the lung microbiota (32) . The application of high-throughput sequencing has been successful. Equally data from our group applying these approaches in a large adult CF cohort compared to non-CF age-matched controls will be discussed. There was a significant (p< 0.05) decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, RF3, Tenericutes, and Lentisphaerae in individuals with CF at the phylum level, relative to the non-CF controls. Notably, there was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in Firmicutes in people with CF relative to the controls (47% vs. 39% respectively). The gut microbiota diversity of those with CF with low IV antibiotic users was higher compared to those in the intermediate or high IV antibiotic user groups (p<0.05). Individuals with CF who had severe lung dysfunction (\u226440% FEV 1 ) had significantly (p < 0.05) reduced gut microbiota diversity relative to those with mild or moderate lung dysfunction; those with mild lung disease (\u226570% FEV 1 ) had the highest gut microbiota diversity of all CF individuals studied.",

CFMATTERS (www.cfmatters.eu) is a research consortium addressing this area. Preliminary data from this consortium will also be discussed. While some centers have used eradication protocols for Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the last 3 decades, antibiotic eradication therapy (AET) has only recently become standard of care among CF centers in North America. Two large interventional trials, ELITE and EPIC have demonstrated high efficacy of a protocol involving an inhaled antibiotic alone, and 28 days of inhaled tobramycin (TIS, 300 mg bid) has now become standard of care and is recommended as first-line therapy in recent CF Foundation guidelines (1). However, there are ongoing efforts to further optimize therapy and to better predict response with the goal to prevent chronic infection in all patients. Even with current treatment strategies, there is evidence that the rate of chronically infected patients is decreasing; no other CF therapy has had similar success except ivacaftor in patients with gating mutations. The long-term benefit of AET on lung function decline and mortality has been more difficult to define and it may decades before this can be established (2, 3) . While some trials assessing different treatment strategies are still ongoing, evidence from data analyses from previous trials or cohort studies have provided additional insights that can help to guide treatment decisions at the present time.",

Assessing in Toronto, pancreatic insufficiency (a proxy for severe CFTR genotype), and female gender were associated with a higher risk of failing AET (4). Older age and worse lung function were additional factors which may reflect the less homogeneous deposition of inhaled antibiotics in patients with lung function impairment. As most of the studies on eradication therapy have been performed in children, defining whether protocols should be modified for adults or patients with impaired lung function remains to be clarified. In addition to host factors, evidence from the EPIC trial suggests that bacterial phenotypical changes that are associated with chronic adaption of P. aeruginosa strains were more likely associated with treatment failure (5) . Whether this reflects specific changes of these strains or simply longer persistence of these bacteria in the respiratory tract before they were detected on culture and AET was initiated remains to be determined.",

Therapy for these patients varies widely between centers, reflecting the lack of established and validated protocols. At the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, we have developed a staged approach which is aligned with European guidelines and that we continue to evaluate regarding its efficacy (6) . If the first attempt of eradication therapy with 28 days of TIS fails, a second cycle of the same therapy is prescribed while trying to address other factors that could affect treatment success such as adherence to inhaled medications and physiotherapy. Based on our experience to date, treatment success is lower than for eradication therapy overall, but negative cultures are achieved in approximately one third of the patients. If P. aeruginosa is not eradicated with two cycles of inhaled antibiotics, we administer intravenous antibiotics for 14 days followed by 28 days of TIS (7) . Preliminary evidence suggests that this strategy leads to eradication in another one third of the patients. If this fails as well we initiate chronic maintenance therapy with inhaled antibiotics. Important questions to address include whether the eradication protocol should be modified in stage 2 by using another preparation of inhaled tobramycin such as tobramycin inhalation powder or another class of drug such as inhaled aztreonam, which has also demonstrated success in the context of eradication therapy (8) or whether persistence of P. aeruginosa in the sinuses is a factor causing lack of clearance of the organism (9). Given the high success rate of initial eradication therapy, the focus will shift towards defining the best strategies for second-line treatment where the success rate is currently still not satisfactory.",

Deep sequencing of longitudinal isolates has allowed us to examine the changes in genetic diversity within a single individual over the course of chronic infection. We found that within-host variation correlates with bacterial burden and that both of these are reduced by effective antibiotic treatment. We observed phenotypic heterogeneity in antibiotic resistance and colony morphology which suggests that the development of within-patient variation can lead to clinically relevant changes. In addition to this we found evidence of convergent evolution in genes linked to virulence and of mutations conferring a hypermutator phenotype.",

Comorbidities such as lung disease, heart disease, prematurity, neuromuscular diseases, and immunodeficient states increase significantly the likelihood of developing lower respiratory tract disease, hospitalization and death. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a unique autosomal recessive disorder affecting multiple organs, in particular, the lungs. There are over 60,000 individuals worldwide afflicted with CF. Progressive recurrent lung injury from pulmonary exacerbation is a hallmark feature of CF. Viral and bacterial infections are important causes of the pulmonary exacerbations. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are at increased risk of developing prolonged pulmonary tract symptoms, pulmonary function abnormalities and disease progression with acute respiratory illnesses, even though they do not appear to be at increased risk of acute respiratory illnesses compared to healthy age-matched individuals. In recent years the use of molecular diagnostics has improved our understanding of the respiratory viral pathogens affecting children and adults with CF with acute respiratory illnesses. The prevalence of the common respiratory viruses among CF children and adults appears similar to those of healthy controls but the consequences can be significantly different. Rhinovirus-es and coronaviruses which are the common causes of colds in children and adults can often lead to pulmonary exacerbation, decrease pulmonary function, and disease progression in subjects with CF. In a recent meta-analysis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, a higher hospitalization rate and case fatality rate were observed in CF individuals compared to the general population as well as those with asthma. In this Symposium on \"Challenging Topics in Infectious Diseases\" the clinical impact of respiratory viruses in CF children and adults will be described in the era of molecular diagnostics; the use of molecular diagnostics as the preferred diagnostic method for respiratory viruses will be discussed; application of next generation sequencing technologies for unbiased detection of viral pathogens and for evaluating the microbiota (microbial diversity and abundance) of the respiratory tract will be introduced. A future direction in research will be determining the changes that occur and persist in the respiratory microbiota during acute respiratory viral infections using newer technologies such as 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. Such information will provide new insights in the role of viruses and the interactions of respiratory viruses, pathogenic bacteria and inflammatory mediators on lung injury and disease progression, and might provide a mechanism for controlling chronic lung injury. Islet-Acinar Axis. The pancreas is critical for digestion through its exocrine role as well as in glucose homeostasis and gut motility through its endocrine role. It is not a coincidence that the Islets of Langerhans are juxtaposed to the acinar cells and that the blood efflux from the islets directly bathes the acinar units to directly modulate acinar cell output (1) . At the other end of the spectrum, from a disease perspective exocrine pancreatic disease is known to predispose a subset of patients to develop diabetes mellitus, which is now termed Type 3c Diabetes Mellitus. Whether CFTR is present in \u03b2 cells has been controversial. However, recently Guo et al (2) demonstrated in cell culture and in transgenic mouse models that CFTR plays an important role in \u03b2 cells to regulate glucose sensitivity, resting membrane potential, and mediate action potentials that are coupled to insu-lin secretion. Although modifier genes may play a role in risk for CF-related diabetes mellitus (3), data from Soave, et al (4) suggest that there is a causal relationship between the length of time and degree of exocrine pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis and the risk of CF-related diabetes mellitus. Thus this cross-talk between the exocrine and endocrine pancreas may be critical not only in normal homeostasis, but also in the risk of disease.",

The net result is an increase in pH which is thought to be critical for i) solubilization of proteins within pancreatic juice and preventing protein plugs from forming, and ii) aid in alkalinization of intestinal chyme within the proximal intestine along with duodenal bicarbonate secretion. Loss of CFTR function would be expected to cause protein plugs to form within the intra-and interlobular pancreatic ducts predisposing to pancreatitis as well as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Freedman, et al has shown both in vitro and in vivo in cftr -/mice, that lack of alkalinization leads to a reversible precipitation of proteins secreted from the acinar cell with the plugs consisting of GP2, the homologue of the Tamm Horsfall protein responsible for renal cast formation (6) (7) (8) (9) . Loss of normal CFTR function would also impair alkalinization of the intestinal chyme. The effects of this alteration in pH within the intestinal lumen would be profound leading to impaired pancreatic enzyme activity, bile salt precipitation, and altered mucus folding/function.",

Alkalinization of the acinar lumen through activation of CFTR localized to centroacinar and proximal intralobular ducts, in turn drives the cleavage of GP2 from the ectoleaflet of the acinar apical plasma membrane, stimulating a tyrosine kinase and signaling internalization of the exocytic membrane patch to the Golgi for recycling in the regulated secretory pathway.",

Major mechanisms for non-CF associated chronic pancreatitis include oxidative stress, ductal obstruction, toxic-metabolic factors (eg, alcohol) and a sequence of necrosis-fibrosis (9) . In CF, the pathophysiology is attributed to a defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, but the pathogenesis of organ pathology remains obscure and includes a proinflammatory state coupled with an exuberant inflammatory response to injury (10-12), a pH-dependent defect in acinar cell endocytosis (13, 14) and imbalances in membrane essential fatty acids (15) . Human autopsy data of deceased children (16) and of aborted fetuses suggests that ductular plugging and obstruction (of viscid secretions and cellular debris) begins within the acinus (17, 18) and precedes development of histopathological evidence of inflammation detected postnatally (19, 20) . The time-course of events is less clear; in a fetal CF pig model (21, 22) the pancreas has evidence of both inflammatory infiltrates and ductular plugging (12) . Duct cell proliferation and mucus cell metaplasia, common responses to chronic injury or obstruction, were late events detected only in newborn pigs (12) .

            "text": "CF Studies: The non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor ibuprofen is the only anti-inflammatory agent approved for CF airway disease (25) . Ibuprofen slows deterioration of lung function (26) , possibly through a narrow dose-dependent reduction in lung neutrophil migration (27) , but continuous corticosteroid treatment also attenuates deterioration in lung function (23) . Due to systemic toxicity, however, steroid treatment is not recommended. Antioxidant treatment aims to correct CF-related antioxidant deficiencies (eg, glutathione) to ameliorate the impact of oxygen free radicals released by neutrophils and other cells. Current data are mixed but in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT), the glutathione precursor (N-acetylcysteine) stabilized lung function but curiously without influencing neutrophil biomarkers (28) and in a small RCT oral glutathione associated with improved growth in pediatric CF patients (29) . Agonists of the ligand-activated transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activating receptor (PPAR) gamma are possible therapies because CF tissues have reduced PPAR gamma expression (30, 31) and activation of the PPAR gamma signaling pathway has anti-inflammatory and multiple other pleiotropic effects. In a single, preliminary (unpublished), small (n=20 patients) and short duration (28 days) study the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone did not reduce sputum inflammatory mediators in healthy individuals, but warrants further evaluation. Potential limitations of PPAR gamma agonists are potential adverse effects with use of rosiglitazone (fluid retention and cardiovascular risk) and pioglitazone (fluid retention and unconfirmed risks of bladder cancer).",

COX-2 is overexpressed in human chronic pancreatitis (32) and selective COX-2 ablation reduces severity of inflammation in experimental acute pancreatitis (33) . However, indomethacin, which inhibits COX-1 more than COX-2, reduces post-procedural pancreatitis when patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) are pretreated with rectal indomethacin (34) . Corticosteroids induce remission of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), reduce pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis, trigger regeneration of acinar tissue and increase pancreatic enzyme and bicarbonate secretion. There may also be a link between inflammation and CFTR mislocalization to the subapical membrane, which was present in 11 patients with CP and in AIP; steroids reverse mislocalization in AIP (35) . There are older but no well-designed human studies that support corticosteroid treatment for forms of CP other than AIP (36) . Antioxidant treatment is a strategy to treat pain in chronic pancreatitis. There are conflicting data, however, whether a 5-component antioxidant cocktail (containing selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and methionine) reduces pain in chronic pancreatitis (37) (38) (39) but there appears to be a modest reduction in the frequency of pain in patients with deficiencies of antioxidants and/ or antioxidant-scavenging enzymes and increased markers of oxidative stress (37) . Targeting PPAR gamma signaling could potentially simultaneously treat multiple pancreatic (and perhaps extra-pancreatic) derangements, in part due to interactions between the endocrine and exocrine pancreas; in a nonobese model of insulin resistance, PPAR-gamma treatment abolished impairments of both pancreatic endocrine function (insulin resistance) and pancreatic exocrine function in mice (40) . In other experimental models of chronic pancreatitis, PPAR-gamma treatment reverses established pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis (reviewed in ref 40) .",

Freedman and colleagues described defective acinar cell endocy-tosis in CF models that was reversible by alkalinizing the acinus lumen, which is more acidic in CF (13, 14) . An exciting but unstudied therapeutic approach would be to use CFTR correctors to target the primary defect in CF disease. Conceivably, augmentation or correction of ductal secretion of chloride and bicarbonate could restore ductal lumen patency, improve exocrine pancreatic function and perhaps pancreatic inflammation and pain (when present). Additional common sense approaches include abstaining from exposures such as smoking, which impairs basal pancreatic secretion of bicarbonate (41) (42) (43) (44) , and alcohol, which impairs CFTR expression, localization and bicarbonate conductance (45). The pancreas is one of the primary organs affected by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. While exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is a well-recognized complication of cystic fibrosis (CF), pancreatitis is under-recognized. There is a highly robust genotype-phenotype correlation between the development of symptomatic pancreatitis and the severity of CFTR genotype. The risk of pancreatitis is greatest among those who carry mild genotypes (1). It is therefore unsurprising that pancreatitis occurs exclusively in patients with exocrine pancreatic sufficiency (PS). The presence of a \"critical mass\" of pancreatic acinar tissue is necessary for symptomatic pancreatitis to occur (1).",

To answer this question we need to determine if CFTR is expressed in the pancreatic beta cell, if so what its function is in the beta cell, and whether correction of CFTR improves insulin secretion. Several investigators have now found CFTR expression and localization in beta cells from human and rodent cells and from beta cell lines. There is increasing evidence that chloride ion transport plays a small but important role in insulin secretion. In cell culture, insulin secretion is inhibited when CFTR activity is blocked, and stimulated when CFTR activity is increased.",

Surprisingly little is known about events that lead to the treatment of a PEx and although we use one descriptive term, there are many proposed causes of a PEx, suggesting PExs may have different clinical presentations or phenotypes. PEx phenotypes could affect treatment decisions and outcomes after PExs. Of particular concern is whether therapeutic decisions contribute to the occurrence of poor outcomes. In a study from a single US CF Center, PEx treatment strategies for 193 patients were reviewed to assess for factors associated with the risk of a subsequent PEx. Increasing treatment duration and the proportion of treatment in the hospital were both associated with a modest increase in risk for a subsequent PEx (14) .

Given the frequency and clinical importance of PExs, it is imperative to maximize our ability to treat effectively and ensure treatment decisions do not contribute to poor outcomes. The Pilot Observational Study to Determine Feasibility of a Standardized Treatment of Pulmonary Exacerbations (STOP-OB) in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02109822) was developed to begin to address some of these unanswered questions and overcome some of the limitations of epidemiologic studies. The primary objectives of STOP-OB were to gather additional information from clinicians and patients and to assess the feasibility of, and clinical equipoise for, future studies of PExs using the CFFPR. Results from this study will inform the design of interventional studies, with the ultimate goal of improving patient care and treatment outcomes.",

As we establish a framework for protocol-based PEx comparison studies, there is ample opportunity to test the hypothesis that differences in PEx management can affect outcomes: >9,900 patients followed in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) were treated with IV-ABX for >19,600 PExs in 2013 (6) . Although it is difficult to argue against seeking PEx management optimization, the devil lies in the endpoint details. We would like to believe that compelling, objective evidence that a particular PEx management practice is associated with improved patient outcomes would lead to management change across the CF community. However, while endpoints can be chosen to assure objectivity in clinical trials, the \"compellingness\" of a result is another matter that is almost wholly dependent upon how the endpoint resonates with the evaluating individual. For instance, in the Pilot Observational Study to Determine Feasibility of a Standardized Treatment of Pulmonary Exacerbations in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (STOP-OB-13; clinicaltrials.gov NCT02109822), study investigators indicated that ~53% of PEx IV-ABX treatments were primarily administered for lung function recovery versus ~45% that were primarily administered for sign and symptom improvement (2% had no stated primary goal) (8) . Does this suggest that some clinicians would find prospective PEx studies employing a lung function recovery endpoint more compelling than a sign and symptom improvement endpoint, or vice versa? Is there a unifying PEx endpoint that all can agree is compelling?",

Observing a better outcome is a test of superiority, while concluding that outcomes are \"similar\" is a test of equivalence/non-inferiority, for which we would need to establish what measured difference (delta) in an endpoint is not clinically meaningful before a study begins.

The statistic that 25% of patients fail to recover 90% of their \"baseline\" FEV 1 after PEx is widely known and oft-quoted (9); optimizing the proportion of patients that recover baseline lung function seems an obvious goal for comparative studies. However, there are some real problems with an FEV 1 study endpoint: 1) A patient's baseline is a historical measure that, if available, may not reflect their response potential. The admission FEV 1 of ~1 in 5 STOP patients exceeded their prior 6-month baseline (ie, they had already achieved their baseline before treatment); nearly half of these patients experienced a subsequent treatment-associated FEV 1 improvement. 2) When do we measure FEV 1 response? Mean STOP FEV 1 change from admission to treatment peak was ~12% predicted, but mean change at Day 28 was only ~7.5% predicted. Bringing patients back for an extra clinic visit outside of their normal care is an expensive burden that would likely discourage consent and enrollment: almost 25% of STOP patients lacked Day 28 data.",

The CF Respiratory Diary-Chronic Respiratory Symptom Score (CFRSD-CRISS) is currently under FDA review as a clinical trial endpoint and performed well in the STOP study (8) . As might be expected, there were patients with substantial CRISS score reduction (ie, improvement) that did not experience much if any FEV 1 improvement, and vice versa, but the general trend was that increasing FEV 1 from admission was accompanied by decreasing CRISS. Challenges with CRISS as an endpoint stem in part from lack of familiarity with it -what CRISS response would be \"compelling\" to clinicians, especially those focused on FEV 1 improvement? How do we set a CRISS delta and non-inferiority margin? In addition, we have no historical CRISS data to rely on: there will be no CRISS baseline (regardless of reliability) to aspire to reach. And finally, as with FEV 1 , we probably want to measure CRISS response at some point after the end of treatment, as differences between peak and Day 28 CRISS responses were also observed in STOP (8) .",

Regardless of how a PEx is diagnosed or treated, or how response is evaluated, if a patient is retreated shortly (eg, \u226430 days) after finishing treatment, is it reasonable to consider that a treatment failure? Observational CFFPR data suggest that PEx retreatment within 30 days is not uncommon. When the first IV-ABX-treated PEx after Jan 1, 2010 was analyzed among >15,400 unique CFFPR patients, 6.7% of patients (>1000) were retreated after 3 days but before 30 days after the end of their first treatment, an event rate similar to the ~7% observed in the STOP study. Although one might assume that differences in PEx risk factors among patients would make it difficult to identify PEx treatment effects in mixed populations by early retreatment, analyses suggest otherwise. For instance, the unadjusted odds for retreatment within 30 days for patients who were treated with IV-ABX for <9 days was more than double that of patients treated for between 9 and 15 days. Adjustment for known PEx risk factors (eg, age, FEV 1 , prior-year PEx, sex, Medicaid status, F508del genotype, complications) had little to no effect on this odds ratio. Because PEx treatments are already captured in the CFFPR (7), this endpoint does not require an additional posttreatment clinic visit, and risk of retreatment should be compelling to stakeholders.",

Acute pulmonary exacerbations have an adverse impact on patients' quality of life and a major impact on the overall cost of care. They are also associated with progression of lung disease (1). A drop in FEV 1 is a sentinel sign of a pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) and recent analyses of the CF Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) have found that about 25% of patients treated for exacerbation do not completely recover this loss of lung function following treatment (2) . More importantly, only about 40% recover to 100% of their baseline (2). The reason for this lack of lung function recovery is not known, and there may be different causes for incomplete recovery in different patients. It is possible that an intense local inflammatory response to change in airway bacterial community, viral respiratory tract infection, or inhalation of environmental lung irritants produces irreversible lung damage. Alternatively, we must consider the possibility that irreversible loss of lung function may be attributable to inadequate PEx treatment in some instances. Whereas description of the former sequelae would require measurement of clinical and physiologic factors and assignment of PEx to different phenotypes, the question of adequate versus inadequate treatment of PEx will require comparative research trials.",

The possibilities include antibiotic selection, number, and duration; location of treatment; and adjuncts to treatment (eg, the addition of systemic corticosteroids). All of these potential studies are meritorious given the current state of the art and the paucity of evidence for the management of CF acute PEx. It is not that there is a lack of evidence, but that the existing literature has not provided convincing evidence to support a particular approach. For example, the site of treatment (home versus hospital-based treatment) has been assessed in a number of observational studies (6) . The challenges with studying the site of care is that there are inherent biases as to who would be enrolled in the study, and if we could randomize to site of care, then who would bear the cost of such a study design (funding body vs insurer)? One could study the number of antibiotics (monotherapy vs dual therapy) based on the limited clinical trial data on this topic (7), but many physicians would likely feel that this question does not have equipoise given the current practice standards. Alternatively, one could study the impact of a short course of systemic corticosteroids based on the findings from an earlier clinical trial in CF (8) . However, the challenge of such a trial is the lack of a current standard approach to the treatment of exacerbation (9) , adding variability to each treatment, which increases the chances of imbalance with randomization and requires a large trial to obtain conclusive results. The most logical choice of trial is a comparison of varying durations of treatment, consistent with what has been studied in other pulmonary diagnoses (ie, pneumonia). This approach could yield a standardized approach to management that could then lead to establish a more facile platform upon which to conduct additional clinical trials in PEx.",

The Children's Hospital Of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA It has been long known that patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) need a high calorie diet to promote normal weight gain and adequate growth in children and weight maintenance in adults. With the known relationship between body mass index (BMI) and lung function (FEV1), there is an emphasis put on adequate nutrition intake on all patients with CF. The CF Foundation recommends patients with CF to consume diets up to 110-200% higher in calories than the standard population. Since fat is the most calorie-dense macronutrient in our diet, high calorie diets tend to contain at least 35-40% of their calories from fat. As the median survival for patients with CF continues to rise, the quality of fat in the diet becomes a concern. Historically, cardiovascular disease has not been a problem for patients with CF due to their short lifespan. Little information currently exists about the cardiovascular health of patients with CF at the present time. It is prudent, however, for CF practitioners to promote a high calorie diet in conjunction with a heart healthy diet to potentially decrease the risk for cardio-vascular complications into adulthood. Additionally, the care of CF patients is family-based and it is in the best interest of the CF patient and their family to learn how to increase calories using healthy oils and fats rather than calorie boosters that are high in saturated fat.",

Bone health and diabetes control are likely improved. Further, better fitness is associated with longer survival, so there is a strong temptation to conclude that an exercise program will improve survival. The reasons for benefits that accrue from exercise are not completely understood, but there is evidence that exercise causes the electrical charge inside the patient's nose (nasal PD) to approach normal, suggesting an effect at a cellular level. Yet it is a whole person approach, and one that requires care teams (physicians, nurses, physical therapists, exercise physiologists) to work with patients and families to devise strategies to enable patients to adopt an active life-long lifestyle. Pain is recognized to adversely affect health and the quality of life of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) (1), while physical activity has been associated with improvement of their pulmonary health and feelings of well-being (2) .

Gene expression can be influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation or histone modification. We developed tools to directly modify the epigenome at the level of individual genes, to alter gene expression in a targeted fashion. Combining synthetic DNA binding proteins such as transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) or Crispr associated protein 9 (Cas9) with enzymes that modify the nearby epigenome, we have developed a strategy we call \"epigenome editing\" (1). Epigenome editing can be used to target multiple enzymes to one genomic locus, such as gene promoters or distal enhancers, or distinct enzymes to different loci in the same cell with minimal off target effects. This strategy is utilized to both uncover the regulatory mechanisms of genes, or as a strategy to compensate for DNA variation in promoters or enhancers that reduces gene expression. Future goals will be to use epigenome editing to revert disease states by modulating gene expression.",

CFTR encompasses nearly 200 kilobases of genomic DNA, flanked by CTCF-binding enhancer-blocking insulator elements. The gene is regulated by cell-type specific intronic enhancers, which loop to the promoter in the active locus. Within the CFTR topological domain (TAD) multiple transcription factors (TFs) are recruited to the enhancer elements to coordinate gene expression. siRNA-mediated depletion of CTCF or the cohesin component, RAD21, showed that these two factors have distinct roles in regulating the higher order organization of CFTR. CTCF mediates the interactions between CTCF/cohesin binding sites, some of which have enhancer-blocking insulator activity. Cohesin shares this tethering role, but in addition stabilizes interactions between the promoter and cis-acting intronic elements including enhancers. In intestinal epithelial cells promoter:enhancer associations are also dependent on the forkhead box A1/A2 (FOXA1/A2) TFs. Using chromosome conformation capture methods we showed that the three-dimensional structure of the CFTR gene has several tiers of interaction, with an outer loop generated by the association of CTCF sites that flank the locus and correspond to the TAD, which is evident in all cell lineages. Inner loops are cell type-specific and correlate closely with the location specific enhancer elements in each cell type. Depletion of CTCF or RAD21 increases CFTR gene expression and alters TF occupancy across the locus. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of cis-regulatory elements across the locus demonstrated the critical role of both CTCF and TFs in maintaining normal CFTR gene expression levels.",

We observed the deregulation of miR-NAs previously reported in literature and others that directly or indirectly act on the CFTR expression. For instance, miR-449 family, key regulators of cilia formation, are among the most expressed miRNAs in our models. These miRNAs are deregulated in CF compared to non-CF.

Indeed, there is variability in individual patient response with a proportion of patients having more than 5% increase in FEV 1 % predicted. What factors could contribute to these differences? Wild-type CFTR function and expression can be decreased by in vitro exposure to P. aeruginosa-diffusible material (12) . Therefore, these authors suggested that CFTR corrector efficiency may be affected by infectious components. However, in the phase 3 study sub-analysis, the treatment benefit was similar in all subgroups: age, sex, baseline disease severity, Pseudomonas colonization status. One could wonder whether differences in drug exposure play a role. Since the same drug dose is prescribed regardless of age, weight and co-medication of the individual patient, differences in serum and tissue drug levels are likely. Maybe combo treatment efficacy can be improved by titrating the drug dose in the individual patient as is done for many antibiotics, anticonvulsants, inotropic drugs. For expensive drugs, the extra burden and cost of measuring a serum level and if necessary adjusting drug dose certainly outweigh the risk of not achieving the optimal effect. This may be highly relevant in a population with a long list of co-medication.",

Some potentiators, including VX-770, appear to interfere with \u0394F508-CFTR folding and corrector action (2), suggesting the need for improved potentiators that do not affect CFTR stability (3) . An ideal corrector would normalize \u0394F508-CFTR cellular processing and function to that of wildtype CFTR, without the need for potentiators or additional drugs.

The premise is that corrector combinations, each targeting distinct \u0394F508-CFTR defects, might improve correction efficiency. Proof-of-concept screens support this idea, and demonstrate the identification of small molecules that, when used together with maximal VX-809, produce greater correction efficacy than maximal VX-809 alone (5) . Another approach has been the identification of single compounds with dual potentiator-corrector activities (6) .

A systemic marker that could be measured in blood or urine would allow for a relatively noninvasive assessment of infection and inflammation beginning earlier in infancy. However, a systemic marker may not be sensitive enough to detect a meaningful change in lung disease, given that the inflammatory response to infection in the CF lung is largely confined to the lung. Changes in circulating total IgG concentrations, which may reflect chronic lung infection, appear to correlate modestly with lung function decline in older children with CF 10 . Circulating neutrophil markers including calprotectin and G-CSF and acute phase reactants such as CRP and serum amyloid A are able to distinguish children with mild versus severe underlying lung disease 11 .

There is strong evidence that CF lung disease starts early in life, often before symptoms become apparent.

Studies comparing the sensitivity of MBW parameters to detect early disease in CF infants have yielded conflicting results. While LCI has been reported to be elevated even in infants diagnosed by newborn screening, the rate of detecting abnormalities was not necessarily higher than for forced expiratory maneuvers (2-4) and the same seems to be the case for comparisons to CT in young children (5) .

Cross-sectional data have demonstrated that the majority of preschool CF children have abnormal LCI values thus leaving room for improvement through interventions. Nitrogen washout technology has been validated in preschool children and multiple sites have been trained for ongoing interventional studies such as the hypertonic saline study in preschool children (SHIP). Therefore, expertise and availability of MBW measurements will increase significantly over the next few years. Technical issues related to preschool MBW measurements are currently addressed in an ATS working group. However, to move MBW into a clinical tool will require additional information to better define its utility in this setting. One important aspect is to define the natural variability of MBW measures in health and disease to define what constitutes a significant change in LCI. We ae currently conducting a NHLBI-sponsored study in which healthy children and children with CF are followed by MBW at multiple time points throughout a year.This study, conducted at three sites (Indianapolis, UNC and Toronto), will include 80 healthy children with CF assessed at time points similar to an interventional study. Preliminary data presented at this meeting suggest that while LCI remains stable in healthy subjects, it increases (worsens) over time in CF patients. Interestingly, there is a difference in the slope of deterioration between children who experienced exacerbations versus those who did not (7) . The next phase of the study includes measurement of patients at baseline, and at the time of a pulmonary exacerbation and antibiotic therapy. Preliminary data suggest that LCI worsens at the time of a pulmonary exacerbation and that improvement with antibiotic therapy is not uniform (as expected from experience with spirometry in older subjects) (8). If confirmed, this could support the use of LCI in clinical monitoring of these patients in whom we currently largely have to rely on clinical judgment rather than objective tests. Supported in part by NHLBI (1R01HL116232-01). Although airways from infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) appear anatomically normal at birth, lung disease can start very early in life. This disease develops in very heterogeneous fashion, progressing to bronchiectasis in less than a year in some regions of the lung but seemingly sparing other airways, and some individuals, entirely. Our group has hypothesized that abnormal hydration of mucins is the initiating defect in early CF airways disease, with heterogeneity arising from the fact that redundant (non-CFTR based) systems can normally maintain airway hydration but are vulnerable to localized exogenous insults that alter the airway milieu. Thus, we predict that early CF airway disease would be characterized by changes in airway mucins and aspects of the airway microenvironment (reflected in the metabolome and microbiome) that could alter redundant hydration pathways.",

Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-postive bacterium that commonly colonizes the skin and nares of all people, even in health (1). In specific clinical situations and in susceptible people, S. aureus frequently causes pathogenic and invasive infections; in fact, this pathogen is one of the most common causes of human infections that require hospitalization (2), many of which affect the lower respiratory tract. S. aureus encodes many factors and behaviors that mediate colonization, infection, and virulence during infections (3), including adhesins to enable biofilm formation and adherence to host tissues, numerous toxins that can damage or kill host cells, and a variety of genes and products that confer resistance to killing by antibiotics and host immunity.",

With these treatments, and as people with CF lived longer, S. aureus was supplanted as the most common CF respiratory pathogen by other bacteria, predominantly P. aeruginosa (6) . Recently, however, that trend has reversed. In many countries, the prevalence of S. aureus has quietly increased (6,7), recently surpassing P. aeruginosa to again become the most common bacterium cultured from all CF respiratory specimens in the US (8) . S. aureus is particularly prevalent among children with CF, with a peak prevalence of about 80% between the ages of 6 and 17 in the United States, and dropping off to about 50% in later adulthood (8) .

            "text": "To further complicate matters, at least two antibiotic-resistant subtypes of S. aureus have recently attracted specific scrutiny and concern. methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) respiratory infection has increased in prevalence in the US CF population from ~3% in 1998 to just over 25% in 2013, with the increase primarily occurring among teenagers and young adults (8) . Similar prevalences have also recently been observed for small-colony variant (SCV) S. aureus (16, 17) , but because SCVs are difficult to detect using routine laboratory methods that are rarely but increasingly used, it is not known whether or how SCV prevalence has changed in recent decades. While both MRSA and SCVs have been associated with more severe lung disease outcomes (16, (18) (19) (20) , they are each also associated with higher antibiotic treatment burden prior to detection, raising the question of whether these S. aureus subtypes cause or reflect more severe disease (or both) (16, 18) . MRSA can be further subdivided into different genetic subtypes, each with different epidemiologic and antibiotic resistance implications, providing an additional layer of complexity. Until the relationships between clinical outcomes and infection with these and other S. aureus types are clarified, antibiotic treatment strategies (including for prophylaxis, eradication treatment, and exacerbation treatment) are likely to remain as controversial and variable as they currently are. In this symposium, we will hear about recent and ongoing observational and interventional studies that aim to better define those relationships and to identify more effective treatments for S. aureus CF respiratory infections.",

Thus the resistance mechanism is genetically determined and cannot be overcome by higher antibiotic dose, as would be seen in borderline resistant S. aureus, which has also been described in CF (1). Of the multiple SCCmec types described few occur frequently and have clinical relevance (2) .Traditionally, MRSA has only been associated with hospitals where pre-existing antibiotic use, underlying diseases and indwelling catheters are known risk factors (HA-MRSA). Since the 1990s, MRSA infections have been emerging in previously healthy subjects without risk factors. These are mostly skin and soft tissue infections but severe, necrotizing pneumonia can occur. Isolates from these so called community-associated (CA-MRSA) infections were determined to carry the SCCmec IV element in contrast to the SCCmec II element seen in healthcare-associated infections (3, 4) . This is clinically relevant as the SCCmec IV element encodes only for resistance to \u03b2-lactams, whereas the larger SCCmec II carries additional resistance genes responsible for resistance to other classes of antibiotics. Further, SCCmec IV strains may express the pantone-valentine leukocidine (PVL), a pore forming toxin, which may be associated with worse disease but its unique role for necrotic infections remains debated.",

Antibiotic susceptibility testing of the 290 isolates collected showed differences in frequency of resistance especially for fluoroquinolone agents with 90% SCCmec II vs 38% SCCmec IV isolates being resistant; SCCmec II isolates were also resistant to more classes of antibiotics resembling observations reported for non-CF MRSA.

The majority of these are larger epidemiologic studies in patients with acute MRSA infections often requiring intensive care. In these settings differences in outcomes were not related to strain differences (7) nor vancomycin MIC (8) but rather to acquisition of the infection in the hospital and underlying disease (9) (10) (11) . People with CF have chronic infections and recurrent exposure to healthcare and antibiotics. The epidemiologic study of S. aureus resistance in CF (STAR-CF) examined outcomes and factors associated with acquisition of MRSA types. Subjects with CF (\u226418 years) whose MRSA isolates had been typed (69.5% were SCCmec II MRSA) were followed prospectively for a mean duration of ~ 2 years during which time every clinic visit and prescription of any antibiotics and symptoms were recorded. The 287 subjects had on average 6 (SD 2.9) clinic visits per year with antibiotics being prescribed at 58% of all clinic visits for increased symptoms. Among protocol-defined exacerbations, the rate was higher in those with SCCmec II compared to those with SCCmec IV isolates (2.9 [95% CI: 2.7, 3.0]). At the time of study enrollment, subjects with SCCmec II had significantly longer duration of MRSA infection than those with SCCmec IV (mean = 4.7 [3.1] vs 3.1 [2.5] years, respectively, p<0.001). The risk for protocol-defined exacerbations however remained higher when adjusting for duration of MRSA infection, study site, sex, and presence of P. aeruginosa (12) .",

In a cross-sectional study, Ren and colleagues have shown that CF patients infected with MRSA, as determined using standard sputum culturing techniques, have lower lung function than those with MSSA as the only pathogen (5) . An additional study using data from the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF) showed that MRSA acquisition did not impact rate of lung function decline (6) . Interestingly, Dasenbrook and colleagues came to a very different conclusion when they evaluated the longitudinal impact of MRSA acquisition on lung function in patients with CF (7) . They found that the rate of lung function decline was greater in those patients with MRSA compared to non-MRSA patients in patients age 8 to 21 years. In an additional manuscript, persistent MRSA infection was found to be associated with increased mortality in CF (8) .

Eighteen (82%) were MRSA-negative in the treatment arm and 5 (26%) in the observation arm at day 28 (difference: 56%, 95% CI: (25%, 74%)). Among 27 MRSA-positive at screening, 8 (67%) were MRSA-negative in the treatment arm compared to 2 (13%) in the observation arm (difference: 53%, 95% CI: (16%, 75%)) at day 28. Although neither difference was statistically significant, exacerbation rate per day through day 28 was reduced in the treatment arm vs observation arm (rate ratio: 0.36, 95% CI: (0.08, 1.29)), and the proportion of patients experiencing at least one pulmonary exacerbation by day 28 was smaller in the treatment arm (difference: -21%, 95% CI: (-44%, 4%)). The intervention appeared safe. Among 11 subjects required by the protocol to have safety laboratory values assessed at Day 15, one subject was noted to have elevated liver transminases [aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT)] which were deemed clinically significant; this elevation resolved on follow-up. One subject had elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. One subject experienced a low white blood cell count and a low hemoglobin. There were two serious adverse events deemed unrelated to study drug. Only those 12 years of age and older in the intervention arm had follow-up safety laboratory assessments at the end of study drug treatment. Overall, the intervention appeared safe and well tolerated.",

Despite finding no clear safety concerns, the overall sample size of the trial was small, meaning we could easily have missed a rare safety signal. However, the regimen utilized in this trial employed medications that have been extensively employed in both CF and non-CF children and adults with known safety profiles. Of particular note, we have less experience in regard to the risk of rifampin in a CF population; this is important given the likely presence of subclinical liver disease in CF. The study did not address some important topics, such as: 1) What are the long term clinical implications of an eradication protocol? 2) What steps should be taken for the patients who don't eradicate? 3) Would such an approach work in the clinical setting of an acute exacerbation? 4) What components of the eradication protocol are essential for success? However, given this new evidence, the potential clinical implications of MRSA infection, and the social and public health implications of chronic infection, early eradication may be an appropriate treatment approach for most CF patients with newly acquired MRSA.",

In 2013, MRSA was detected in the respiratory tract of 25% of all individuals with CF (1). MRSA has been associated with increased hospitalizations, more rapid lung function decline and worse survival compared to similar CF patients without MRSA detected in the respiratory tract (2) (3) (4) . Given the increase in the prevalence of MRSA in CF as well as the association with worse outcomes, there has been significant interest in strategies to treat respiratory tract MRSA infections. Unfortunately, persistent MRSA lung infections in CF patients are difficult to eradicate or manage using oral or IV antibiotics, and there is no standard of care to manage the infection in CF patients (5) .",

The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) states that addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry and further discusses that dysfunction in these circuits leads to characteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations (2) . While little is known about the long-term effects of substance addic-tion in people living with CF, it is generally believed to have a negative impact on the health, well-being and longevity of any individual who struggles with a substance use disorder. This subsequently presents as a challenge for the CF healthcare team to assist in the management of two very complex chronic diseases simultaneously.",

Addiction is a behavioral pattern of substance abuse characterized by overwhelming involvement with the use of a drug or alcohol (3) . While there are no data to isolate those individuals living with CF and a substance use disorder, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in 2013 identified that an estimated 21.6 million persons in the United States of America aged 12 or older were classified with substance dependence or abuse in the past year (8.2 percent of the population aged 12 or older). Of these, 2.6 million were classified with dependence or abuse of both alcohol and illicit drugs, 4.3 million had dependence or abuse of illicit drugs but not alcohol, and 14.7 million had dependence or abuse of alcohol but not illicit drugs. Overall, 17.3 million had alcohol dependence or abuse, and 6.9 million had illicit drug dependence or abuse (4).",

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identifies that enough prescription painkillers were prescribed in 2010 to medicate every American adult around-the-clock for a month. Although most of these pills were prescribed for a medical purpose, many ended up in the hands of people who misused or abused them (5) . Pain, alone, has been identified as an independent risk factor for inappropriate analgesic use (6) . As healthcare providers within the multidisciplinary CF care team, it should be highlighted that many patients with substance use issues seek guidance and advice (with their initial pain presentation) from their health care team (7) . The opportunity is thus presented to identify potential patients at risk, in addition to those with established concerns. Findings from a single-site study in 2006 suggest that provider discomfort and avoidance are important barriers to evidence-based brief alcohol counseling (8) . Establishing routine and standardized assessments for those patients receiving care at a CF center, beginning in early adolescence, could identify at-risk patients and assist in the management of existing dependence issues going forward.",

When addic-tion becomes the focus for an individual, the balance and attention towards maintaining health as it pertains to their CF care, is directly affected. The consequences of this diversion from treatment would be evident in the decline of their overall health status, although potentially further masked by the effects of the substance being abused. Supporting the needs of the healthcare team (who are also indirectly affected by the choices that a patient makes as it pertains to the substance use disorder) can be equally as important as the support of the needs of the affected patient and their family. Furthermore, identifying and acknowledging that a substance use disorder should be classified as a chronic disease, provides the necessary long-term support and management that is appropriately indicated, to ensure successful outcomes for the patient with CF. Ester Fride, an Israeli scientist, hypothesized that because there is a fatty acid imbalance in CF, the endocannabinoid system was likely affected and that stimulating the system may decrease some of the symptoms of CF. She suggested that THC could provide benefit in reducing nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain. She also postulated that THC may decrease lung inflammation, promote bronchodilation, and suppress cough (1).",

However, heavy and longterm use was associated with increase in cough, sputum and wheeze (2) . Other risks associated with smoking MJ include development of lung bullae and pneumothoraces, as well as invasive aspergillosis. Research has found that almost all MJ is contaminated with mold and Aspergillus species are regularly isolated (3). Vaporizing MJ is a smokeless method of inhalation where MJ is heated to a mist at 180 to 200\u00b0C, which is below the combustion point 230\u00b0C. A 2007 study found no significant increase in carbon monoxide exhalation levels prior to MJ vaporization and after (4). The \"high\" from inhaled MJ occurs within a few minutes and lasts from 1-3 hours. Ingesting marijuana results in a delayed onset of about 30-60 minutes and effects may last for many hours (5) .",

In the past this has meant a major disconnect between the inpatient and outpatient settings in overall coordination of care and information. Roughly 4 years ago we attempted to bridge this gap and cooperatively came up with several interventions which have greatly improved coordination and communication between the two care settings and promoted investment by the inpatient staff to address CF care issues. These included identifying outpatient staff resources that the inpatient team could reach out to (such as CF Nurse Coordinator), a more streamlined admission protocol for CF patients including admitting to only one internal medicine physician group, development of a computerized CF admit orderset, behavioral contracts for patients with adherence issues or drug seeking behaviors which results in discharge from the hospital if not participating in ordered therapies (as long as they are medically stable), encouraging use of non-opioid analgesics and non-pharmacological interventions for managing pain, and a stronger stance on avoiding narcotic pain medications and other controlled substances when possible. We also initiated a weekly care team meeting involving both inpatient and outpatient staff. Currently the Adult CF Nurse Coordinator goes to the adult hospital for this meeting and the meeting consists of the following participants: Adult CF Nurse Coordinator, CF Pulmonologist (when available), Internal Medicine Attending Physicians, Nutrition, Clinical Nurse Managers, Case Management, Pain Management Clinical Nurse Specialist, and the Respiratory Therapy Supervisor/CF champion. This forum serves as venue to discuss behavioral issues, behavior contracts, pain management issues, compliance with therapies and overall plan of care. It has been invaluable in helping to keep everyone on the same page so that a clear message is given to the patient and so that the entire care team is aware of inpatient care issues. This meeting has also served as a venue to address general inpatient process improvement issues in which both inpatient and outpatient team members should be involved (ie, infection control policy changes, transition, etc).",

We work hard to foster an open and honest clinic environment so that patients feel comfortable discussing addiction issues without fear of judgment; however we also discuss the implications these issues can have on their care such as excluding them from transplant. For a number of reasons many of our adult patients do not have a primary care provider.

Our center has found that good communication/coordination between care settings, a clear consistent message to patients and staff about limiting the use of narcotics when possible, and clear inpatient behavioral expectations has decreased the amount of narcotics used inpatient and subsequently outpatient and has also improved compliance and accountability to inpatient therapy regi-mens. Future plans to improve this aspect of care would focus on identifying mental health and pain management resources in our area to collaborate with our CF center to provide more coordinated care as well as a more formalized way to screen for and address pain, depression, and anxiety in the outpatient setting.",

Despite the effectiveness of newborn screening (NBS) for CF and concerted efforts to prioritize nutrition in the management of CF in the US over the last 20 years (2), suboptimal nutrition persists. Although the majority of patients diagnosed with CF in the US are identified in early infancy (3) very little is known about the current growth patterns and correlates of pulmonary disease in CF infants during the first year of life. Identifying these patterns is an important first step in targeting vulnerable patients. Nearly 40% of infants in a single-center study failed to catch-up to their birth weight z-score by two years of age despite early diagnosis by NBS and provision of a high calorie diet and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy early in life (4) . It is clear that other as yet identified factors contribute to malnutrition in infants with CF. These highly vulnerable infants have not previously been evaluated in a prospective multicenter study powered to evaluate growth parameters and a range of confounders. We hope this study will set the stage for new approaches to management of malnutrition early in life, which has the potential to alter the long-term devastating consequences of CF. However, to take advantage of this potential, we need to define measurable outcomes and identify biomarkers of disease progression.",

The study's primary objective is to define and describe incremental weight gain and linear growth in the first year of life utilizing research quality growth measures that will be applicable as efficacy outcomes for future interventional studies in infants with CF. Sites were trained in techniques to measure infant weight, length and head circumference. Anthropometrics were obtained up to 9 times (1-6, 8, 10, and 12 months of age) and parent-reported dietary intake and symptom diaries 3 days prior to each study visit were recorded. Weight and length for age z-scores were calculated using the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards (Geneva, 2006); falling below the 10th percentile (corresponding to z-score< -1.28) was categorized as \"at risk.\" Respiratory cultures were performed as clinically indicated while lung exam findings, hospitalizations, and concomitant medications were recorded. Biospecimens (urine, stool, blood, oropharyngeal swabs) were collected prospectively, providing a powerful platform from which hypotheses can be generated and further innovation can occur. Planned evaluations include stool and respiratory microbiome and metagenome, urinary infant metabolome, and plasma inflammatory mediators.",

This function is particularly illustrated in pregnancy where during the 3rd trimester, placental transporters biomagnify levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA), resulting in very high levels of these LCPUFAs in the fetus. In addition, it is well established that the balance of n-3 to n-6 fatty acids is important in immune ontogeny as well as the regulation and termination of inflammation. DHA is a pleoiotropic fatty acid with 22 carbons and 6 double bonds, which enhances membrane fluidity, is an important source of energy for the cell, and through its metabolism to resolvins, maresins, and neuroprotectins, plays a critical role in the termination of inflammatory processes (1) .",

Oral administration of DHA corrects this membrane lipid imbalance and normalizes the histology in ileum and pancreas and attenuates LPS-induced lung inflammation. Similar results were seen in a congenic murine model of CF in response to long-term DHA therapy (3) . The mechanism by which low DHA levels lead to increased inflammation in these murine models is at least in part, mediated through low levels of PPAR g in affected tissues (4) .",

Using 16HBE and IB3 cell lines with their respective controls, we have shown that in the presence of high linoleic acid in vitro, there is accelerated conversion of linoleic acid to AA (6, 7) . This is the result of increased delta 6-desaturase activity which normally is a rate limiting step in the biogenesis of AA. These data would suggest that the low levels of DHA are secondary to the increased levels of AA as a result of increased flux through the n-6 pathway, rather than a primary abnormality in DHA production. Furthermore, this would lead to the prediction that high linoleic acid diets would lead to increased downstream AA levels and its proinflammatory eicosanoids. In fact, providing high-dose linoleic acid in vitro to CF airway cells or in vivo to cftr -/mice results in increased AA levels concomitant with increased IL-8, PGE2, and PGF2a secretion (8) . Supplementing cftr -/mice with high-dose linoleic acid to mimic the diets of patients with CF increased AA levels in lung tissue associated with increased neutrophil infiltration into the airway, as compared with control mice. These findings support the hypothesis that increasing linoleic acid levels in the setting of loss of CFTR function leads to increased AA acid levels and the genesis of proinflammatory mediators. The mechanism by which oral DHA corrects these abnormalities is through the inhibition of the delta 6-desaturase as well direct competition for incorporation of AA into the sn2 position of phospholipids.",

Despite this time span the interrelations are still unclear. Only a few studies find an association between mutations and LA deficiency (for review, see Strandvik (1)).

One early study indicated a more basic defect, since heterozygotes were also shown to have slightly lower LA concentrations, as were patients with pancreatic sufficiency.

The defective AA regulation was verified in different systems, and increase of AA products, the eicosanoid metabolites in urine, supported the findings of a general increase of the AA metabolism (1). This was not due to an increased supply of LA, which has been given to most CF patients in Sweden for more than 3 decades, since the inverse correlation between LA and AA was similar in CF as in controls. The high turnover has been illustrated by an increased activity of the elongases and desaturases, which has also recently been suggested as the primary defect behind the increased turnover of LA (5) .

In the FIRST study serum retinol, total 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], and \u03b1-tocopherol were measured at approximately 4 months, 12 months, and 18-24 months of age. Feeding and vitamin supplements were assessed monthly prior to age 6 months, bi-monthly from 6-12 months, and every 3 months from 12-24 months.",

Further, the sequellae associated with the chronici-ty of CF lung infection and inflammation require concurrent approaches to CF care (4). New therapeutics have been developed which can aide in addressing different aspects of CF (5), however how these therapeutics translate from the bench to the bedside has not always been well predicted. The lack of translation is likely due to the variability in models (in vitro or in vivo), biomarkers evaluated, presence of infection and whether the therapeutic has been tested in the context of deficient Cftr. The pig and ferret models have both shown important insights related to multi-organ abnormalities as well as intrinsic pulmonary insufficiencies and susceptibility to infection (6, 7) . However, cost and ability to breed enough for therapeutic testing is daunting. The mouse model, even without obvious intrinsic disease, presents with a robust host response to pathogen exposure and defective capacity to resolve both infection and inflammation. Although the mouse model has no defects in mucocilliary clearance, they provide a cost effective way to evaluate lung pathogen response, therapeutic toxicity, potency and efficacy in the context of deficient Cftr and chronic infection (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . This symposium will explore the current CF therapeutic testing models and how they might be utilized to explore new anti-inflammatory therapeutic characteristics. Consideration will be given to cost of the model, the efficiency of developing the model design, the outcomes measured and the impact this might have on translation to the clinic.",

Alpha-1 proteinase inhibitors and ibuprofen have been proposed to decrease inflammation and improve outcomes in this disease (15, 16) . However, the inflammatory process is the host response to pathogen exposure and is necessary for the elimination of infectious agents, so the worry in CF has been on whether these new anti-inflammatory therapeutics will result in increased pathogen susceptibility and colonization. This is not unique to CF. In transplantation, patients are maintained on immunosuppressive drugs with vigilant surveillance for cytomegalovirus resurgence (17) whereas in rheumatoid arthritis, anti-TNF therapy is given with caution for previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (18) . In CF, clinical trials with BIIL-284 (a leukotriene B4 antagonist) were terminated prematurely due to a marked increase in pulmonary exacerbations (19) . The pre-clinical studies for validating BIIL-284 were done in wild type rats, not rats defective in Cftr activity (20) . Recent studies using the Cftr knockout versus wild type mice showed that although the wild type mice treated with BIIL-284 were able to resolve Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, the Cftr deficient mice were not (21) . These observations suggest that the Cftr deficient lung is different than the wild type lung and that all anti-inflammatory agents destined for CF trials should be evaluated in Cftr deficient models in the context of chronic infection (22, 23) .",

The murine model of CF can provide a consistent and reproducible model in which to measure the differences in the CF host's inflammatory response to pathogens relative to controls with functional Cftr (24), providing an ideal window for studying anti-inflammatory drugs in the context of ongoing chronic infection (25) . This model can also be utilized to ascertain in vivo safety and toxicity as well as contribute to identifying the optimal dosage and long-term impact in vivo in scenarios of deficient Cftr activity. This symposium will outline how the CFTR-deficient mouse models have provided important information with regards to outcomes of anti-inflammatory therapeutics in the context of chronic infection, as well as current practices to utilize the technology to define safety, efficacy and impact in a cost-effective and efficient manner.",

The BIIL 284 clinical development program in CF consisted of a single dose followed by a 14-day multi-dose safety/PK study with 30 and 24 CF subjects exposed to BIIL 284, respectively. This was followed by a 6-month 600-patient phase 2b trial, which was terminated early due to increased SAEs in the BIIL 284 treatment group (1) . Given this experience, a phase 2 study demonstrating at least some degree of safety and potential for efficacy conducted in a smaller number of patients (eg, < 100) for a duration of 2 or 3 months would seem prudent before launching into a larger and longer phase 2 or phase 3 trial.",

And this in spite of the fact that ibuprofen has been shown to substantially decrease neutrophil migration across the oral mucosa in CF patients after only 10 days of treatment (4) . It is unknown if a 2-or 3-month treatment duration with ibuprofen would yield a signal in induced sputum. Evidence from an early controlled trial of azithromycin demonstrated a beneficial effect on sputum elastase (but not IL-8) after 6 months of treatment, but earlier time points were not assessed (5) . A more recent azithromycin trial demonstrated effects on systemic markers after 28 days of therapy (but markers in sputum were not assessed) (6) .

Outcome measures have been established that have been shown to capture treatment effects for interventions such as antibiotics, mucolytics and more recently CFTR modulators. The path is more complex for anti-inflammatory therapies which, based on current experience, have less shortterm effects but rather can provide longer-term benefits (1,2). Thus, anti-inflammatory therapy is less likely to result in short-term improvements in lung function whereas it can potentially reduce lung function decline which is not a feasible trial endpoint as it requires studies to be conducted over multiple years.

Significant amount of preclinical evidence for safety is needed in a context that reflects the complex situation in the CF airway, which is to introduce an anti-inflammatory agent into an organ that is chronically infected with bacteria. While phase I studies can be single-dose studies, phase II studies will likely require a longer time period than the commonly used 2 to 4 week time frame to obtain some readout suggesting efficacy. This is unlikely to be a lung function parameter such as FEV 1 , but could be a biomarker of inflammation with known relevance to CF lung disease which is linked to the mechanism of action of the drug. Sputum markers of inflammation are potentially useful, but unfortunately demonstrate high intra-and inter-subject variability and do not necessarily change in shortterm anti-inflammatory trials (3) . Blood inflammatory markers hold some promise and have shown improve-ments after 4-week treatment with azithromycin in P. aeruginosa-negative patients (4). As lung function is less likely to improve with anti-inflammatory therapy, phase II studies can be used to assess trends in the rate of or time to next pulmonary exacerbation as an established outcome measure that could be positively affected by treatment. Pulmonary exacerbations are also an important safety measure as anti-inflammatory therapy can potentially exacerbate infection as demonstrated in a phase II study of a LTB 4 receptor antagonist which was found to have negative effects on pulmonary exacerbation rates (5) .",

This has enriched the CFTR2 population for European ancestry individuals, and perhaps under-estimates variants seen in Eastern Europe, Central/South America, and Asia. Second, there is considerable variability in how the individual variants are described. As CFTR was identified before universal naming/numbering standards such as HGVS, different DNA diagnostic labs or registries may consider the same variant by different names. Third, there are also patients entered in their registries as having either a nonCF-causing variant or an incomprehensible or impossible protein/nucleotide change. These individuals need definitive genotyping to correctly assign genotype to phenotype and to determine potential therapies. Finally, the phenotypic heterogeneity present raises questions about other modifiers, either genetic (within CFTR or elsewhere in the genome), or environmental. It is challenging in a registry-based study to capture the potential covariates that may contribute to the phenotypic diversity. In CF this is most notable for lung disease.",

Correlation between mean sweat chloride and mean lung function was much stronger when patients were grouped according to genotype, rather than for individuals. When genotype groups are analyzed using a mixed effect model, the correlation between mean sweat chloride concentration and mean lung function (either single time-point or semi-longitudinal) was statistically significant and closely paralleled the changes seen in response to small molecule CFTR modifying agents.",

All CF NBS algorithms begin with measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) from a dried blood spot. If the IRT is elevated, CFTR gene mutation analysis, a repeat IRT 1-2 weeks later, or a combination of these is performed to improve the specificity of the test. In infants with a positive NBS, measurement of sweat chloride (Cl -) is required to establish a CF diagnosis (2, 3) .

California, with its highly diverse population, has chosen to incorporate focused sequencing of the CFTR gene rather than test for specific mutations (4). The variation in CF NBS algorithms means that genetic information obtained through CF NBS is specific to each state, and the false negative and positive rates will also vary depending upon the state. CF NBS is a screening program, not a diagnostic program. There have been numerous cases of mislabeled blood spot specimens or lab errors (5) . The diagnosis of CF still relies on measurement of sweat chloride concentration or independent confirmation of CFTR gene mutations other than the NBS result. Recent data from the US CF Patient Registry suggest that many infants are being assigned the diagnosis of CF based solely on the DNA mutation analysis done during NBS (6) . Although some CFTR gene mutations have been associated with pancreatic sufficiency, the CF Foundation infant care guidelines still recommend obtaining fecal elastase (FE) on all CF infants to objectively assess pancreatic function (3). However, 57% of infants in the Registry are missing FE data (6) . These observations underscore the importance of not using genetic information from NBS to make diagnostic and clinical decisions for newborns diagnosed with CF.",

This occurs when either the sweat chloride concentration is in the indeterminate range (30-59 mmol/L) or fewer than 2 disease-causing CFTR gene mutations are found on the NBS panel. In the US, the term for this group of infants is CFTR-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) (9) , while in the Europe, the term CF screen positive/indeterminate diagnosis (CFSPID) is preferred (10) . Infants with CRMS or CFSPID present a treatment challenge to clinicians and a stress on families. Early reports of CRMS outcomes were limited to small, single-center studies (11, 12) . These studies found that in general CRMS infants did well, but a small percentage developed clinical features concerning for CF (eg, oropharyngeal culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). More recently, several studies from around the world have greatly expanded our knowledge of the prevalence and outcomes of CRMS [6, [13] [14] [15] . Taken together, these studies have shown that CRMS is a relatively common outcome of CF NBS, with a CF:CRMS ratio ranging from 1.4:1 to 5:1 (6, 15) . Most all CRMS infants have normal pancreatic function and demonstrate normal nutrition and growth parameters. However, in the first 3 years of life, about 10-15% of infants developed clinical features concerning for CF, such as a positive oropharyngeal culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 15) . In one prospective study 11% of infants transitioned from CRMS to CF, either through further mutation analysis information or an increase in their sweat Cl -, while another longer term retrospective study found that 48% of infants evolved into a clinical diagnosis of CF (13, 15) . Another common finding is that the genotype F508del/R117H/7T is present in a substantial proportion of CRMS infants (6, 13, 15) . Infants with one disease-causing CFTR gene mutation, one nondisease-causing mutation (based on CFTR2 criteria), and a normal sweat Clare unlikely to develop clinical features of CF (16) . Taken together, these studies suggest that CRMS/CFSPID infants may have a small risk of converting to a true CF phenotype and that the mutation combination of F508del/R117H/7T may be associated with clinical features of CF.",

            "text": "In summary, the identification and study of genetic variation that modifies severity of \"monogenetic\" diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, is progressing rapidly, and offers great promise for better understanding of non-CF-TR genetic causes of disease severity in CF, as well as identification of new therapeutic targets. Because of the collaborative and complementary nature of studies being undertaken in CF, there is reason to be optimistic that emerging data will drive progress for better prognostic and therapeutic approaches. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Currently, the fraction of the CF population that have gating mutations such as G551D can be treated with ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that increases the open probability of the mutant channel. As of June 2015, defect-specific therapies are not yet approved for the more common Class 2 misfolding mutations, most notably \u0394F508. Prior experimental work has shown that combinations of suppressor mutations or compounds that promote correction of the folding of nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) and assembly of the native multi-domain structure, can act synergistically to efficiently correct the folding defect seen in \u0394F508. To extend these foundational studies, we employed the information from the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) project which assembled clinical data and accompanying CFTR variants from individuals with CF enrolled in national registries and large clinical centers from 24 countries. Previous analyses of the CFTR2 set of rarer disease-causing mutations revealed that nearly half of the missense and in-frame deletion mutations do not fold efficiently, and, thus, these genotypes presented an opportunity to study which mutations could be corrected by specific small-molecule correctors and categorized. We have evaluated the differential responsiveness of 41 missense and in-frame deletion mutants from the CFTR2 dataset for their ability to mature in response to correction by temperature shift, step 2 correctors such as C3, C18, a step 1 NBD1 corrector P247-A, and combi-nations thereof in HEK 293 cells; a model used to study CFTR maturation. We then performed functional studies on several of the correctable mutants to assess Clchannel function in FRT cells. The results reveal that some of the mutants respond to a single compound, while others exhibit synergy when two compounds are employed, and still others are not significantly rescued by extant small molecules in this system. Based on their responsiveness to specific correction strategies, these mutations were then clustered into three broad clades: those that did not achieve 1% of wild type maturation after treatment with any corrector or combination (severe Class 2 maturation mutants), those that responded to at least 1% levels (partially correctable Class 2), and those that exceeded 50% of wild-type maturation prior to treatment. Many of those in the last cluster were either gating or conductance mutants or were nonCF-causing. We further examined the cluster of class 2 mutations that reached 1 to 50% maturation after treatment and found that increased folding was reflected in increased function for some, but not all, of these mutants. Thus, this cluster contains not only classic Class 2 mutations, but also Class 2 mutations that also have either a gating and or conductance defect even when folded. Some of the mutants in the well-folded cluster also matured more efficiently after treatment with correctors and this was reflected in functional improvement. As such, some of these non-Class 2 mutants may also benefit from corrector treatments. These results are an early step toward precise theratyping of all CF-causing mutations. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians and results from a paucity of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (1, 2) . CFTR is a cAMP-activated chloride (Cl -) channel that is localized in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells where it has an integral role in regulating the transport of electrolytes and water. The major pathology of CF is the accumulation of viscous mucus at the epithelial surfaces of organs including the lungs (3) and gastrointestinal tract (4) , which can result in blockages, infection, inflammation and progressive organ dysfunction including respiratory failure.",

Interestingly, we more recently found that 4PBA also regulates the expression of a novel chaperone of the ER lumen, ERp29 (ER protein of 29 kDa). We demonstrated that ERp29 has increased expression in CF epithelial cells treated with 4-phenylbutyrate, and that ERp29 appears critical for proper biogenesis of wild-type CFTR. In addition, overexpression of ERp29 corrected F508del CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane (16) . ERp29 was thus the first luminal ER chaperone demonstrated to promote CFTR biogenesis and trafficking.",

Viral infections are linked to pulmonary function decline, antibiotic use, prolonged hospitalizations and increased respiratory symptoms in the CF patient population (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . While the incidence of virus infection is not elevated in CF patients, as compared to healthy controls, the length of infection and severity of symptoms is dramatically increased in CF patients. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinoviruses (RV) are two of the most common viral culprits of disease progression in CF, with RSV promoting early respiratory tract morbidity and lung function reductions and RV being the most common causative agent in pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients (7) (8) (9) . Moreover, beyond the morbidity associated with viral infections alone, infection with viruses has been shown to facilitate infection with P. aeruginosa and may lead to chronic infections in CF patients (10) . Increased incidence of viral infections has been associated with worsening pulmonary function as well as secondary bacterial infection and colonization (11) . Seasonal variations have also been noted in which patients with CF initially contract infection with P. aeruginosa during the winter months (5) . Viruses can facilitate binding of pathogenic bacteria to the respiratory epithelium and impair immunologic clearance of the bacteria (12) . The mechanisms underlying how viruses enhance chronic infections with P. aeruginosa, however, are not understood. Using a co-culture model for bacterial biofilms grown in association with the CF airway epithelium, our data demonstrate that respiratory virus infection with both RV and RSV dramatically enhances P. aeruginosa biofilm growth in association with the airway epithelium.",

            "text": "The airway epithelium is a critical component of the innate immune system, providing the first line of defense against pathogen invasion and is activated when microbial ligands engage various families of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs). When respiratory viruses infect the airway epithelium, they are detected by PRRs and antivi-ral substances are produced, with type I and III interferon (IFN) being the major antiviral molecules produced by airway epithelial cells (AECs) (13) . Type I and III interferons stimulate an antiviral state in target cells by increasing the transcription of hundreds of diverse genes, as well as down-regulating gene expression of a handful of genes to exert antiviral effector functions. Since the antiviral functions of IFN-regulated genes can be deleterious to the host if inappropriately activated, many of these genes maintain very low levels of basal expression and rapidly and robustly increase their expression when IFN is detected by its receptor (IL-28\u03b1/IL-10R\u03b2 receptor for IFN-\u03bb; IFN\u03b1R1/2 for IFN-\u03b2). For this reason, type I and III IFN signaling uses a unique signaling pathway, where engagement of a ligand with its cell surface receptor leads to a rapid activation of a transcription factor complex (STAT1/2 and IRF9), which in turn activates IFN target gene transcription (14) . IFN signaling induces antiviral, as well as anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory effects in target cells (14) . Using a variety of models, others have shown that some IFN target gene effector functions promote pathogen replication, suggesting that pathogens have evolved to subvert and even benefit from the interferon response in host cells (15) (16) (17) (18) . In our studies, induction of IFN signaling, in the absence of virus infection, can recapitulate the virus-stimulated P. aeruginosa biofilms. A major area of interest is elucidating the IFN effector genes that induce P. aeruginosa biofilm production and the mechanism by which biofilm production is induced during virus infection.",

            "text": "Many environmental cues have been described to contribute to the conversion of P. aeruginosa to a biofilm mode of growth, including the nutrient iron. Nutritional immunity postulates that due to the necessity of iron for microbial growth, respiration and metabolism, the host employs many regulatory pathways to sequester free iron from pathogens. This competition for iron between pathogens and the host has been widely studied. A recent study by Hunter et al reports dramatically elevated levels of ferrous iron in CF patient sputum and correlates this with disease severity (19) . While increased sputum iron clearly advances CF lung disease, many questions are still unanswered about how iron homeostasis is altered in CF and how this relates to airway infection. How iron homeostasis is impacted during viral infection is also not well understood. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to increase cellular iron and reduce plasma iron levels by down-regulating FPN in the GI tract and on macrophages. Increased cellular iron favors HCV replication through a mechanism that is not well understood (20) . Increased cellular iron in macrophages has also been reported with HIV infection and dysregulated iron homeostasis is thought to play a role in HIV pathogenesis (21) . In our studies, RSV infection increases iron levels in the airway surface liquid (ASL) and chelation of iron in the ASL can prevent the observed virus-stim-ulated biofilm production. In addition, induction of IFN signaling also promotes iron release into the ASL and potentiates P. aeruginosa biofilm production. Current studies are underway to understand how IFN signaling, in response to virus infection, is modulating iron homeostasis in the airway epithelium.",

The multiple breath washout (MBW) technique measures ventilation inhomogeneity using an inert gas and a simple tidal breathing method. Data in preschoolers demonstrate that the lung clearance index (LCI), a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity, is abnormal or elevated compared to healthy controls and predicts later abnormalities in the school age years (4, 12) . Given that changes in the LCI are associated with chest CT abnormalities, this less invasive and low risk methodology has the potential to be used to track disease more frequently (every 3 months) than sensitive imaging techniques (13) . Finally, abnormal ventilation inhomogeneity at 3 months of age predicts continued abnormality at 1 year of age. These findings during early life may allow identification of the most high risk infants and lead to individualized treatment for those with disease detected through lung function tests (10) .",

With the advent of newborn screening in all 50 states, aggressive identification and monitoring of lung disease becomes paramount. Our current approach relying only on symptoms does not detect the \"silent disease\" in the youngest population and irreversible disease often occurs without clinician awareness. Early lung function testing identifies disease in those without clinical symptoms, is feasible at multiple sites and has shown the ability to monitor treatment response. Given the presence of early disease and the short timeframe to intervene prior to irreversibility, monitoring lung function in our youngest population becomes as important (perhaps more important) as spirometry in the older population.",

In the research setting, this technique has clearly shed light on early CF lung disease (2,3) and has been shown to demonstrate a possible treatment effect with inhaled hypertonic saline (4). Nonetheless, integrating infant pulmonary function tests (PFTs) into routine clinical care, particularly in the US, is another matter. First, at least in our multicenter US study, infant lung function is frequently normal (5) . Second, the lack of robust reference equations, particularly for plethysmography, makes interpretation of results difficult (6) . Third, even in experienced hands, the failure rate (lack of acceptable quality measurements) is high (4, 6) . Fourth, infant PFTs are a burden for families and care providers. Because they are performed under sedation, infants and toddlers must be without food or drink for hours prior to the procedure, making them fussy and irritable. They must be kept awake on the drive to the lab or the chloral hydrate will not successfully sedate. Toddlers can be unstable on their feet and prone to falling for the rest of the day following sedation, so parents must be vigilant. From the providers' perspective, the training required to perform quality measurements is extensive and each test takes several hours of two technicians' time to perform. Fifth, many US centers purchased the nSpire Infant Pulmonary Laboratory to conduct the testing. This device is no longer manufactured or supported. Thus, sites face purchasing the Jaeger/CareFusion Master Screen Baby Body device, at significant expense. Finally, chloral hydrate, the established sedative for infant PFTs, is no longer commercially manufactured in the US (7) and may be at risk in a number of European countries as well.",

Unfortunately, infancy is the one age range for which MBW is not clearly more sensitive than other monitoring modalities. In contrast to older groups, at least half of infants with CF have normal LCI (8) (9) (10) (11) , even in the presence of abnormal RVRTC measurements (9) or abnormal CT (8) . While MBW has been performed in infants in the research setting, moving it into the clinical setting poses important challenges. There are few commercially available licensed devices available that are suitable for measurements in infants and young children. Very little data are available comparing measurements between devices. There also are unresolved issues related to the choice of the inert gas for washout. Most infant studies have been performed with SF 6 as the inert gas, but, as a potent greenhouse gas, SF 6 is expensive and difficult to obtain in the US. For older children, SF 6 is being increasingly replaced by nitrogen (ie, washout of endogenous nitrogen by 100% oxygen), but in infants breathing 100% oxygen may alter breathing pattern and cause atalectesis (12) . Measurements using different inert gases are not interchangeable and their relationship in health and disease is different. Finally, limited reference data in infants and children <6 years are available and are device-and gas-specific (13, 14) . LCI declines through infancy and early childhood (13, 15) , so z-scores must be used to aid in interpretation of raw values. Unfortunately, data generated from one system cannot be applied across other devices.",

Thus, MBW certainly appears to be a promising measure to integrate into clinical care.

Bronchoscopy data concurred with previous work, suggesting that infection with S. aureus occurs early in life -31% of infants have S. aureus in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens at a median age of 3 months. Markers of inflammation (such as interleukin 8 and neutrophils) were significantly raised in CF infants with infection, compared to CF infants who were infection free and to control infants (5). However, bronchoscopy requires a general anaesthetic and most young children do not expectorate. Therefore most day-to-day decisions to treat S. aureus in young children are made on the basis of upper airway culture (sensitivity 80-86% and specificity 61-77% for lower airway infection) (6, 7) . S. aureus can be isolated from the oropharynx of around 48% of healthy children (8) and in around 28% of healthy infants (9) . Treating positive upper airway cultures in every case will therefore result in overtreatment. Nonetheless, there are registry data (though none from randomised controlled trials) which indicate that treatment of each isolate of S. aureus achieves microbiological clearance and results in clinical improvement (10) . Finally, there is little evidence to guide treatment decisions for resistant strains of S. aureus (MRSA) (11) , though an on-going randomised trial is expected to report soon (NCT01349192).",

This practice has been evaluated through registry studies, with conflicting results. A German study suggested that prophylaxis favoured infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12) whilst an Australian study found no such effect (13) . The prophylaxis hypothesis has also been tested in a number of clinical trials. Four randomised controlled trials, of good methodological quality, reporting data on 401 participants aged 0-7 years, were included in a systematic review (14) . The trials varied in the age at study entry (from 5 weeks to 53 months), the prophylactic antibiotics used and the duration of follow-up (between 1 and 7 years). The only consistent finding, across all studies, was that prophylaxis was associated with fewer children having S. aureus at every time point from 1 to 5 years. There were no significant differences in lung function, nutrition, hospital admissions, additional antibiotics or adverse effects. The largest trial (Stutman, et al (15) , 209 patients enrolled and 119 completed, 5-7 years of treatment) suggested that prophylaxis was associated with more children having P. aeruginosa. However, when the data from this trial were combined in a meta-analysis, there was no longer a significant difference in the number of children acquiring Pseudomonas.",

In the next decade we may find out whether these observations are relevant for babies with CF born in the twenty-first century and whether they stand up to the robust test of a clinical trial. Staphylococcus aureus is the bacterium cultured most often from the respiratory tracts of all people with CF. It is particularly prevalent among children, with a peak prevalence in CF of about 80% between the ages of 6 and 17 in the United States, and dropping off to about 50% in advanced adulthood (1) . The reported prevalence of S. aureus respiratory culture-positivity has more than doubled since 1990 (1), a change thought to be due to changes in both microbiological methods and treatment practices. However, S. aureus has long been associated with CF lung disease. In fact, S. aureus was the first bacterium specifically discussed in reference to disease pathogenesis; the earliest reports of the pathology of CF lungs noted high abundances of this bacterium, resulting in the development of inhaled penicillin as one of the earliest CF antibiotic treatments (2) . These early approaches presumed both that S. aureus was an important contributor to CF lung disease, and that antibiotic treatment would be effective in improving clinical and microbiologic outcomes. Information available then, and more accrued since, provides at best variable support for these assumptions.",

Similarly, S. aureus small-colony variants are slow-growing subtypes of S. aureus that have been associated with worse lung disease outcomes.

The agreement, however, stops there. For example, antistaphylococcal prophylaxis is commonly practiced in some countries, but not others. This is also the case for antistaphylococcal treatment upon detection, but in this case, eradication policies and protocols differ depending upon whether the detected strain is methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or MRSA (14) . The evidence that any of these treatments leads to better clinical outcomes is scant and conflicting, and some evidence further suggests that aggressive antistaphylococcal treatment might lead to harm. For example, antistaphylococcal prophylaxis may increase the risk of earlier respiratory infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15) , which has been repeatedly and strongly associated with advanced lung disease. Higher lifetime levels of antibiotic exposure in general are associated with decreased respiratory microbiome diversity, which in turn is associated with worse lung function (16) .

Siblings share an identity, they influence one another's personal development and they form the first social group to develop social skills, solve conflicts and form friendships (1) . The strength of a sibling relationship depends on the children's developmental stage and circumstances. In healthy siblings research shows that during the toddler and primary school years one observes close friendship as well as sibling rivalry; during adolescence siblings may be less close because peers are more important, and during adulthood sibling relationships are often renewed. The bond depends largely on proximity, eg, whether siblings are raised together, similar in age, whether they share friends, etc. The importance of a sibling's relation lies in the warmth and companionship that come with it. Research shows that positive sibling relationships are associated with less loneliness, fewer behavioral problems and higher self-esteem (1). Special circumstances can make a sibling part of an atypical sibling group (1, 2) . Cystic fibrosis (CF) is such a special circumstance.",

            "text": "Siblings and Cystic Fibrosis. CF affects the whole family. Siblings can get lost in the chaos (especially at diagnosis), are (temporarily) treated differently by their parents, rules change because of lack of time. CF may also affect finances or anticipated opportunities (2) . Living with a brother or sister with a chronic illness makes the life of siblings different from peers and studies have shown that siblings often experience psychological problems (3) . Siblings may feel guilty because they do not understand where the illness comes from and maybe it is their fault (4)? Siblings feel less special because a lot of attention goes to the sick child. A young sibling may get angry or disobedient or may show regressive behavior (eg, baby-like behavior). During primary school, siblings becomes more aware of the fact that the sick child is different, has different needs and limitations (1, 2) . Fairness of tasks and household chores may became an issue. Meal times are often burdensome (5) . During this age siblings become aware of other people's reactions. Internalizing problems is common: they worry more, feel lonely, anxious and have low self-esteem (2, 3, 6) . Siblings may take on a part-time caretaker role, eg, supervise nebulizing. Caring for a sick sibling does not necessarily have a negative impact on the sibling, because it provides them with a role, distraction from own emotions and they feel less helpless (1, 2, 7) . During the adolescent years awareness of being different grows. The adolescent siblings may be jealous of peers who have healthy siblings (2, 3) . Siblings may worry about their brother/sister, about causality, their own carrier status, their own future, but also the future of the sick child (2, 3, 6) . Adolescents may feel guilt because they can go out with friends after school, whilst the sick child has to do physiotherapy. Adolescent siblings also become aware of societal prejudices and biases about chronic illness. Many adolescent siblings take up a responsible role towards the sick child (8) . During adulthood, most siblings are still concerned about their sick brother or sister. Feelings of responsibility often remain strong and the adult sibling wants to stay informed and involved. On the other hand adult siblings also need to build their own life, with their own family, job, house, etc. Healthy adult siblings consider themselves diplomatic, responsible, mature, important and loyal but remember themselves as angry, envious and neglected (9) .",

They may have to stay with friends or family. Parents may want to protect siblings from grief, but the risk is that siblings will make up their own story about death, which can be upsetting and/or besides the truth. From the cancer literature it is clear that it is important to prepare siblings (12) . Siblings need to be ready for difficult questions from peers or other adults. Roles in the family may change and it is important for the siblings to know that s/he does not have to make up for the loss of the sick child. Grief and mourning are normal human processes. It becomes traumatic when a person does not want to mourn, cannot mourn or is not allowed to mourn. This may lead to abnormal bereavement behaviors.

Overall, findings in the sparse research on the impact of CF on siblings shows that having a brother or sister with CF affects a sibling's life, yet this impact is not necessarily negative. Only one study has been conducted on the impact of CF on adult siblings (9) . More research is needed on siblings' knowledge of CF, their ideas about CF and treatment and siblings' coping and resilience. Siblings play a crucial role in the lives of patients with CF and it is important to improve our understanding of this special relationship. Within the field of developmental psychology, adolescence has been framed as a period during which peer relationships take on increasing significance. A body of psychosocial research has established the critical impact of friendships on a variety of short-and long-term outcomes, including mental and physical health, emotional and behavioral functioning, and academic success. Furthermore, research among adolescents with diabetes, cancer, and other chronic illnesses suggests a critical role of social support in adolescent functioning, as well as differential ways that youth with chronic illness may perceive support from other healthy versus ill peers. Yet the role of friendships among adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been studied infrequently, and little is known about the impact of adolescents' friendships on critical health outcomes, including adherence, quality of life, and physical health trajectories over time. Thus, the current aims were to: 1) describe friendships among adolescents with CF, including number, duration, frequency of interactions, and positive/negative friendship qualities; 2) examine cross-sectional associations between friendship quality, treatment adherence, and health-related quality of life; and 3) explore the longitudinal impact of friendship quality on trajectories of BMI and FEV 1 .",

Higher levels of positive friendship qualities (eg, companionship, intimacy, support, nurturance, positive alliance) were associated with better overall health-related quality of life (\u03b2 = .43, p < .01). Yet, these same positive friendship qualities were associated with poorer treatment adherence (\u03b2 = -.35, p < .05). Higher levels of negative friendship qualities (eg, conflict, criticism, antagonism) also were associated with poorer treatment adherence (\u03b2 = -.33, p < .05). Furthermore, after controlling for age, gender, and baseline treatment adherence, higher levels of negative friendship qualities were associated with poorer lung health trajectories (FEV 1 %) over the three-year follow-up period.

However, risks of friendships among peers who also have CF may pose unique threats to health that must continue to be addressed by healthcare teams. Mixed support for the role of positive friendship quality (ie, in improving quality of life but not treatment adherence) may reflect the competing demands for youths' time (eg, in spending time with friends versus completing treatments). In contrast, the presence of negative friendships (ie, those involving high levels of conflict, criticism, or antagonism) demonstrated consistently negative effects on adherence and health trajectories over a three-year follow-up. Balancing the demands of CF-related healthcare with normative adolescent social development can present unique challenges, yet preliminary evidence suggests the potential for both short-and long-term health benefits for adolescents with positive friendship experiences. As the life expectancy increases for people with CF, so does the importance of studying issues of adulthood. A relatively new area in CF is illness disclosure. During the transition to adulthood, patients likely encounter situations where telling others about their CF diagnosis, such as new romantic relationships or issues in the workplace becomes necessary or advantageous. Disclosure may be implicit, such as using oxygen in front of others, or explicit, where a patient tells someone directly about their diagnosis. Little is known about disclosure in CF, but previous research with other chronic illnesses populations has identified positive associations with adherence, illness severity, and perceived social support.",

The CF regimen is complex, and may entail performing treatments in front of others (e.g., taking enzymes while out to lunch with friends). If someone is hiding their diagnosis from others, it may prevent them from adhering to their medical regimen. Additionally, if someone is withholding their CF diagnosis, it may inhibit their access to social support. The primary goal of this project was to explore this novel area in adults with CF by examining patterns of disclosure and identifying psychosocial correlates of the construct.",

Participants were majority Caucasian (93%) and male (53%), with a mean age of 29 years (SD = 11.1). Disclosure data were collected at baseline using the Cystic Fibrosis Disclosure Questionnaire. Participants were asked to report whether they had disclosed to all, some, or no people in a category (e.g., Close Friends, Casual Friends, Romantic Partner, Boss, and Coworkers). If they had disclosed, then they rated on a 10-point Likert scale their comfort in discussing their CF with and their comfort in performing CF treatments in front of those people. Baseline psychosocial data were collected using the following measures: 1) Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SS); 2) Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R; Emotional Functioning and Social Functioning); 3) Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D); and 4) Self-Efficacy. Pulmonary medication adherence was measured using pharmacy refill data to calculate a composite medication possession ratio. Lung function was measured by FEV1% predicted values, and body mass index (BMI) was used as a nutritional health marker. We examined patterns of disclosure to others as well as relations between disclosure and psychosocial variables, and disclosure and medical outcomes. Correlations were used to determine relations between comfort in discussing CF and doing therapies in front of the social group and psychosocial and medical variables. T-tests and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to determine psychosocial and medical differences based on whether the person had disclosed his/her CF diagnosis to none, some, or all members of the social group.",

Treatment self-efficacy emerged as a significant correlate of disclosure across multiple domains, with better treatment self-efficacy associated with greater disclosure. Interestingly, there were no correlations with medication adherence. The absence of a direct association between disclosure and adherence suggests that an association could perhaps be mediated through self-efficacy. For example, those who are comfortable with disclosure may also be confident they can overcome adherence barriers, some of which may include social situations. Self-efficacy is an important factor to examine in future disclosure research to determine its contribution to adherence in adults with CF. Longitudinal research is needed to determine potential causal pathways. Clini-cians can work with patients to improve feelings of mastery surrounding disclosure and completion of treatment tasks, and potentially increase adherence.",

On the other hand, disclosure was significantly associated with social support only within the context of close relationships with people who might typically be expected provide tangible, emotional, and informational social support such as romantic relationships, close friendships, and employers. Based on these results, clinicians should gather detailed information about patient's social network and disclosure behaviors to determine whether the patient has adequate social support.

Participants who reported higher levels of confidence in managing their CF and higher levels of social support felt more comfortable discussing their CF and doing treatments in front of close and casual friends. Clinicians should gather more information from adolescent and adult patients about friendships and how CF affects these relationships to determine its impact on their psychosocial well-being and possibly treatment adherence. Chronic illnesses such as cystic fibrosis (CF) can have a significant impact on sexuality/intimacy and adherence in the adolescent and adult population. Chronic illness can have a profound negative effect on relationship and sexual satisfaction of both patients and partners (1) . According to Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development the task of young adulthood is to establish intimacy with others and with oneself. Erikson stated that healthy identity development during adolescence is a precursor of intimacy in romantic relationships during emerging adulthood (2) . Chronic illness can interrupt the process of establishing intimacy (3) . This in turn often negatively impacts young adult sexuality. Issues around adherence and sexuality/intimacy may also have a negative reciprocal relationship in adulthood, causing damage to marriages and adult relationships. This impact can then further lead to psychosocial difficulties around adherence to prescribed health care regimes.",

Goss, M.D., M.Sc. 1. Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; 2. Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the earliest bacteria detected in infants and children with CF. It is the most prevalent organism among US CF children with a peak prevalence between ages 11-15 years (1). The rise of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the last 10 years has caused a lot of attention to this organism. Rates of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA are considerably lower in most European CF centers. Infections of the CF upper and lower airways are commonly polymicrobial, can grow in biofilms, and once established rarely can be eradicated with antimicrobial therapy",

Despite concerns regarding pre-transplant infections and immunosuppression, numerous studies showed that CF patients, including those with pan-resistant bacteria, had similar survival to other pre-transplant diagnoses (1). Regardless of the pathogen's virulence pre-transplant, most pathogens are manageable with the improved mucociliary clearance of the allograft. P. aeruginosa does not significantly affect post-transplant survival. Studies show similar survival even with resistant P. aeruginosa, with an actuarial survival superior to that of non-CF patients",

In the United States approximately 200 patients receive lung transplant yearly. However, as many as 50 patients die or become too sick to transplant while waiting for one. Even though these numbers have improved in favor of offering transplantation to patients, a high number of patients with CF who need a transplant never receive one. There are many reasons for this outcome including access to care, regional and center variations in listing practices, delayed introduction and acceptance of lung transplant by the patients and issues with lung allocation. It is exceedingly difficult to predict timing of death in end-stage patients with CF; even high risk patients might survive for a long time, making it tough for them to decide on the unknown \"journey\" of lung transplant. Assessment of patient readiness is important, but not always easy to do. In addition, there is evidence that patients with Medicaid insurance tend to have less ability to be listed for lung transplantation. In addition, significant variations occur in transplant rate, organ availability between US regions; this is also true when compared to Canada. In addition, different centers use different criteria to keep patients on the waiting list. Despite all the issues, more patients are being transplanted than die and the new CFTR medications might help patients remain alive for longer periods and therefore become able to recieve a lung transplant. In addition, new techniques, including ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP), which makes more lungs available for transplantation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which can help very sick patients remain well enough to receive a lung transplant, can help improve the chance for CF patients who need a lung transplant to receive one.",
