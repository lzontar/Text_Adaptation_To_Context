Within the week of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the University clinic operations were modified to meet the imminent challenges of the epidemic. Routine and nonemergency visits to the University Healthcare Center were suspended. Healthcare workers were retrained and reassigned to emergency shifts with strict compliance to infection prevention and control guidelines. 5 A triage system for suspected cases was setup, which included a 24-hour collaborative emergency network with the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, as well as the State and national emergency response taskforces.",

To address phenomenal spread of such issues across networks, while providing the needed guidance for the University community, various platforms were adopted for a systematic release of veritable and accurate information to the University community. First, a 3-minute in-house produced video (on COVID-19 preventive measures) was aired weekly at film shows organized for students; shared through multiple social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter; and displayed on digital devices across the university campuses. On invitation from local television and radio media houses, live interviews on COVID-19 preventive measures were organized, aired, and streamed as corporate social responsibilities. Weekly interviews, audio-jingles and announcements on COVID-19 preventive measures in English and local languages were aired on the far-reaching radio waves of the University radio station (Unilorin FM) within 40 miles of the University campus. A series of weekly updates on the COVID-19 pandemic response was also published in the University bulletin; while health educational messages were circulated via the university website.",

In addition, the use of 60% to 90% alcohol-based solution in water (volume/volume) as disinfectants is highly recommended for their bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and viricidal properties. 9 To promote the culture of good hand hygiene as well as curtail spread of COVID-19, public hand wash stations were constructed across the University campuses by direct labor. 10 These were complemented with alcohol-based sanitizers produced in-house and dispensed through touchless sensor-based units and 100 mL aliquots across the University campuses.",
