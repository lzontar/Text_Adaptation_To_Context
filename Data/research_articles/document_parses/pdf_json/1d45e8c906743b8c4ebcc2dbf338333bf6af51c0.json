Little is known about the different phenotypes of patients with BOS and their outcomes. We reviewed the data of all allogeneic HSCT recipients referred to our pulmonary department for a non-infectious bronchial disease between 1999 and 2010. We identified 103 patients (BOS (n \u00bc 77), asthma (n \u00bc 11) and chronic bronchitis (n \u00bc 15)). In patients with BOS, we identified two functional phenotypes: a typical OLD, that is, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio o0.7 (n \u00bc 53), and an atypical OLD with a concomitant decrease in the FEV1 o80% and FVC o80% predicted with a normal total lung capacity (n \u00bc 24). The typical OLD was characterized by more severe FEV1 and fewer centrilobular nodules on the computed tomography scan. The FEV1 was not significantly affected during the follow-up, regardless of the phenotype.

[2] [3] [4] Although BOS mostly occurs within the 2 years following transplantation, it can occur as late as several years post transplantation. 3 Many risk factors have been proposed for BOS; however, there are discrepancies in the literature, and only chronic GVHD was systematically identified in all of the studies, which led to the consideration of BOS as a chronic GVHD of the lung. 3 In all previous studies, despite the introduction or augmentation of immunosuppressive regimens, especially steroids, BOS was associated with poor survival. 4 The main limitation in studying BOS is the lack of reliable diagnostic criteria, as respiratory symptoms are usually nonspecific and may reveal another bronchial disease (BD). At present, the diagnosis of BOS mostly relies on PFT, and it was associated with various definitions until 2005, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposed PFT consensus diagnostic criteria for BOS that mainly relied on the presence of a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of o0.7 and a FEV1 of o75% predicted. 5 However, this is a partial definition because some patients with BOS may not fulfill this criterion. In fact, in the case of an OLD arising from a predominant small airway disease (that is, BOS), the FEV1/FVC ratio may remain 40.7; in this situation, because of lung distension with an increase in the residual volume, FEV1 and FVC may decrease concomitantly. 6, 7 Thus, a modification of the NIH PFT criteria for BOS has recently been proposed. 8 These spirometric profiles generate two different populations of patients with BOS that have not been compared before.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 124, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 373, "end": 376, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 377, "end": 380, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 381, "end": 384, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 518, "end": 519, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 762, "end": 763, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 921, "end": 922, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1461, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1824, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1826, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1908, "end": 1909, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Air trapping in lung computed tomography (CT) at expiration may also reflect lung distension; air trapping has been retained in the NIH consensus as a diagnostic criterion of BOS.

We confirmed that the patients who developed BOS within the 6 months following transplantation had a poor prognosis, 11 and we further determined that there was a poor prognosis if BOS developed within the first year.

Although the NIH proposed diagnostic criteria in 2005, it is now believed that these criteria probably only identify the most severe cases. Both these criteria and previous studies did not consider patients who had a concomitant decline in FEV1 and FVC with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio caused by lung distension; however, this phenomenon is a frequent occurrence in the course of small airway diseases such as BOS. [6] [7] [8] In our study, the patients meeting this criterion accounted for as much as 31% of our cohort. The only difference that we found between the two groups of patients was that those with an FEV1/FVC ratio o0.7 presented with a more severe form of the syndrome. Until now, the PFT was considered to be the most reliable diagnostic and follow-up criteria for BOS. However, like Dudek et al., 11 we found that the value of FEV1 was not associated with the patient outcome, and that the FEV1 only changed slightly during the follow-up after the diagnosis of BOS. This finding suggests that the occurrence of an OLD in PFT, regardless of the lung function phenotype, is a late feature of established BOS and that the decline in FEV1 is sudden, rather than progressive, in most patients. However, this conclusion should be tempered by the fact that because of the retrospective design of our study the FEV1 decline could be assessed only in a subset of our patients. When restricting ourselves to this subset, we found that patients who died exhibited a decline in FEV1 over the follow-up. To get further insight in the natural history of BOS and to propose new tools for the early diagnosis of BOS, prospective cohort studies are mandatory. In this setting, we recommend a pre-transplant PFT and then a PFT follow-up at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, then every 12 months after transplantation. We further report that a significant proportion of patients with non-infectious BD after allogeneic HSCT had asthma or CB. Although it has been shown that allergen-specific IgE-mediated hypersensitivity transferred by allogeneic HSCT may explain some asthma after allogeneic HSCT, 20 it is noteworthy that 36% of our allogeneic HSCT recipients who subsequently developed asthma had a history of asthma before allogeneic HSCT. We did not find any specific cause for CB in our patients who were predominantly nonsmokers; it remains to be determined whether this symptom may be related to allogeneic HSCT.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 581, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 582, "end": 585, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 586, "end": 589, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 976, "end": 978, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2246, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study has several limitations.
