Four of them are among the ten most important causes of deaths worldwide: Pneumonia has the highest death toll of all infectious diseases, lung cancer kills the most people of all malignant proliferative disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ranks third in mortality among the chronic noncommunicable diseases, and tuberculosis is still one of the most important chronic infectious diseases. Despite all efforts, for example, by the World Health Organization and clinical and experimental researchers, these diseases are still highly prevalent and harmful. This is in part due to the specifi c organization of tissue homeostasis, architecture, and immunity of the lung. Recently, several consortia have formed and aim to bring together clinical and molecular data from big cohorts of patients with lung diseases with novel experimental setups, biostatistics, bioinformatics, and mathematical modeling. This \"systems medicine\" concept will help to match the different disease modalities with adequate therapeutic and possibly preventive strategies for individual patients in the sense of precision medicine.",

In addition, pneumonia, COPD, tuberculosis, and lung cancer are also among the ten most common causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost worldwide. Pneumonia alone is the single most important cause of DALYs lost, more important than HIV/AIDS, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or diarrhea [ 2 ] . The total cost of lung diseases in the European Union amounts to more than \u20ac380 billion annually. In addition to the abovementioned diseases, asthma alone causes costs of over \u20ac72 billion, consisting of \u20ac19.5 billion for direct medical costs, \u20ac14.4 billion for lost productivity (work absence, early retirement, etc.), and \u20ac38.3 billion for monetized value of DALYs. Lung cancer causes the greatest socioeconomical loss from disability and premature mortality. Because of late diagnosis and limited treatment options, most treatment costs are concentrated within the year of the diagnosis. Therefore, the total annual costs per case are calculated as \u20ac364,000 for lung cancer [ 2 ] .",

            "text": "The lung and airways provide many unique features in terms of anatomy, physiology, and immunology. This paves the way for manifold pathologies and presents challenges for pulmonary clinicians and researchers. The lung is the body's largest organ, but contains about four liters of air and only about half a liter of tissue and the same amount of blood [ 3 ] . Therefore, the organ tissue has to be organized in a sophisticated and delicate way. The main function of the lung is the exchange of two gases, O 2 and CO 2 , between the air that we breathe and the bloodstream. Three main processes are involved in this: ventilation of air along the bronchial tree, passive diffusion of gases, and perfusion of blood through the alveolar capillaries [ 4 ] . These processes are tightly regulated, and not every part of the lung is equally ventilated and perfused. Every day, about 10,000 l of air-containing pollutants, allergens, pathogens, etc.is ventilated through the about 23 generations of dichotomically dividing airways and over a lung surface of about 130 m 2 that is condensed mainly in over 300 million alveoli. The capillary surface has about the same size. Diffusion of oxygen critically depends on a short diffusion distance over the air-blood barrier [ 3 ] . In healthy lungs, the mean thickness of this tissue barrier is about 0.6 \u03bcm, consisting of very thin parts of alveolar epithelial type I cells and capillary endothelial cells sharing one single layer of basement membrane [ 5 ] . This delicate architecture is only possible due to the surfactant layer that lines the alveolar surface, reduces its surface tension, and is released by alveolar epithelial type II cells.",

This disease affects 200-300 million people worldwide, and its prevalence has been increasing over the last decades [ 13 ] . Up to 10 % of asthmatics are considered as severe cases. Typically, the infl ammation in asthma is described to be allergic, eosinophilic, IgE dependent, and Th2 driven [ 14 ] . Therefore, therapy besides bronchodilation targets mainly this eosinophilic infl ammation, either unspecifi c with topical or systemic glucocorticoids, with antileukotriene drugs, or with \"biological therapies\" specifi cally addressing IgE, or probably in the future IL-13, IL-5, and others [ 15 ] . However, suffi cient control of asthma symptoms is impossible in many patients, in part due to more than 50 % of asthma patients that do not show a persistent eosinophilic infl ammation [ 16 ] , and this seriously challenges the classical pathophysiological concepts. Systems-based approaches can help to stratify patients to their phenotypes and respective available therapies and to identify new targets for the treatment of patients that are unresponsive to existing drugs [ 17 ] .",

It causes signifi cant disability, mortality, and healthcare costs, e.g., for lifelong medication, lung transplantation, or mechanical ventilation. The most common causes for the development of COPD are long-term exposure to primary or secondary tobacco smoke, combustion of biomass, e.g., by open-fi re cooking in developing countries, or genetic predisposition. Increasing evidence indicates that COPD is rather a syndrome than a solitary disease. The pathophysiological hallmarks are (1) chronic, cortisone-insensitive infl ammation which causes mucus hypersecretion and fi xed bronchoconstriction and remodeling as well as (2) irreversible tissue destruction in terms of bronchiectasis and emphysema [ 18 ] . They result in respiratory and ventilatory failure. An aggravating aspect is the vicious circle of impaired innate immunity, chronic bacterial colonization, and recurrent viral or bacterial infections called exacerbations and often resulting in hospitalization [ 19 ] . Besides substance avoidance and exercise training, COPD symptoms are typically treated by long-acting airway dilators on a lifelong basis. The underlying pathophysiology of chronic airway infl ammation can be targeted by either topic or systemic glucocorticoids or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. However, these treatments are hampered by side effects and low effectivity. Increasing numbers of patients with severe ventilatory insuffi ciency receive lifelong mechanical ventilation, which is expensive and requires special infrastructure. On the other hand, the chances of COPD patients to receive lung transplantation are decreasing due to high risk of, e.g., cardiovascular or metabolic comorbidities .",

            "text": "The basic aim of systems medicine is to model human pathophysiology and disease to advance our understanding and to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment . Therefore, it is a logical and straightforward strategy to establish big and well-characterized patient cohorts to collect as many clinical and molecular data as possible-and suitable-as a solid base for this modeling process. However, certain processes or features cannot be observed or tested neither in healthy volunteers nor in patients. This includes the early origins of disease, e.g., environmental infl uence on asthma predisposition that may be epigenetically transferred from mother to child, the initial pathophysiological events in the alveolus during development of an infl uenza virus-induced pneumonia, and many more. In part, these problems can be resolved by the use of cell culture or tissue culture models [ 26 ] . However, some aspects can only be addressed in a living organism. In the past, for academic experimental research as well as for drug candidate studies for subsequent human trials, mice have been used to model human diseases because of the practical convenience (easy handling and low costs), the possibility to generate transgenic or gene knockout animals, and the availability of molecular and immunological tools [ 27 ] . However, certain caveats have to be kept in mind: Firstly, some of the lung diseases, e.g., asthma, are unique to humans and do not occur naturally in mice. Secondly, the anatomy and (patho-) physiology may differ signifi cantly between mice and humans. Besides the obvious size difference-the human lung has a volume of 5 l, and the murine lung has a volume of 1 ml-there are also signifi cant anatomical and physiological differences. For instance, the human airways have 23 generations, and the murine has only 13-16, the human airway division is dichotomic, and the murine airway division is monopod; mice do not have respiratory bronchioli, and the cellular composition and vascularization of the lung are different for both species [ 5 , 27 , 28 ] . Moreover, mice strains differ in their likelihood to react to stressors with certain pathophysiological events. In addition, there is increasing evidence that the immune systems of mice and men differ signifi cantly. For trauma, burns, and endotoxemia, Seok and co-workers compared gene response patterns between human subjects and corresponding mouse models: They found that these stressors resulted in highly similar patterns in humans, whereas the responses in corresponding mouse models showed only poor correlations with human conditions and also among each other [ 29 ] . Accordingly, there are several examples where the reliance on animal models misguided the pathophysiological understanding [ 28 ] , led to unsuccessful clinical trials [ 29 ] , or even resulted in disastrous outcomes of clinical studies [ 30 ] . This may be in part due to differences in the molecular repertoire of immune cells in mice and humans: For example, the inherent versatility of macrophages harbors the potential for a plethora of different activation subtypes [ 31 ] . Inappropriate polarization can be detrimental to the host, as macrophages can potentiate an inapt immune response and thus aggravate a pathological condition: In rodents, alveolar macrophages have been found to play an important role for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic animals [ 32 , 33 ] . In mice, solid markers for macrophage polarization are established, as is exemplifi ed by the well-described induction of NOS2 in M1(IFN\u03b3) and of ArgI in M2 (IL-4) macrophages. Corresponding functional markers in the human system are yet to be found, and there are notable differences between human and murine macrophage activation patterns on the transcriptional level [ 34 ] . Accordingly, a comparative study of M2 (IL-4) polarization in mouse and man shows very limited interspecies consistency, as only transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) was found to be a functional marker shared by both [ 35 ] .",

Smith and co-workers established a mathematical model to predict the outcome of pneumococcal pneumonia with the two possible states (1) bacterial clearance, or (2) sustained bacterial growth [ 36 ] . The model is based on data of pulmonary bacterial replication from a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia. Using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it describes three lines of barrier defense: First, the initial alveolar macrophage response mounts a fast but weak defense and is described by only one equation for the bacterial population. Second, the early recruitment of neutrophils consist of cytokine release by different populations of alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, the infl ux of neutrophils, neutrophil apoptosis, and debris removal by alveolar macrophages.

Some more data from previously published mouse studies have been included in another effort to model pneumococcal pneumonia: Bacterial numbers in the lung and the blood and also neutrophil levels from infection experiments with four differently susceptible mouse strains [ 37 ] have been used to calibrate this ODE model. It consists of four equations describing the time evolution of the number of pathogens in the lung and in the blood, damaged lung epithelial cells, and total activated phagocytes. The model has been validated on other published data sets, and its predictions are consistent with most experimental observations. However, no study so far has modeled pneumonia dynamics in patients.

Marino and Kirschner [ 40 ] used a two compartment model to investigate the human immune response to Mtb in the lung. By performing bifurcation analysis of the model, the authors identifi ed key processes of cellular activation and priming that occur between the lung and the nearest draining lymph node that have the potential to determine different outcomes of the Mtb infection. To identify control mechanisms of granuloma formation during Mtb infection in the lung, Segovia-Juarez et al. [ 41 ] built a complex agent-based model which accounts for interactions between Mtb, immune effectors such as chemokines and cytokines, and immune cells like macrophages, CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells. With the help of the model, the authors identifi ed several issues that are crucial for granuloma formation during the course of Mtb infection, including effi ciency of chemokine diffusion, prevention of macrophage overcrowding within the granuloma, arrival time, location, and number of T cells within the granuloma, as well as overall host ability to activate macrophages. To investigate the contribution of CD8 + T cells to control Mtb infection, Sud et al. [ 42 ] built an ODE model of the immune response to Mtb in the lung. Using the model, the authors examined the importance of CD8 + T cells in the control of the infection and determined putative minimum T cell levels providing effective protection following vaccination. A model of differential equations was also developed to investigate the different roles played by alternatively activated macrophages ( AAM ) versus classically activated macrophages ( CAM ) in the early stages of Mtb infection in the lung. The model described the interactions among cells, bacteria, and cytokines involved in the activation of AAM and CAM and was a useful tool to analyze strategies for reducing the switching time (i.e., when CAM become more dominant than AAM), which ensures an adequate immune response to the pathogen [ 43 ] . Similarly, Kirschner's group built two ODE models to investigate the function of macrophage (CAM)-activating cytokines (i.e., TNF \u03b1 and IFN \u03b3 ) in Mtb infection. One model was used to test the ability of macrophages to kill Mtb under different scenarios, in which the macrophage activation is characterized by the timing of IFN\u03b3 and TNF \u03b1 signaling relative to the infection [ 44 ] . The model simulations unraveled a preferred host strategy for mycobacterial control that is implemented via the direct entry of macrophages into a granuloma site from lung vascular sources. The other model was used to predict the contribution of multiple TNF \u03b1 activities to the control of Mtb infection within the granuloma, with the assumption that macrophage activation is a key effector mechanism for controlling bacterial growth in the lung. The simulation results suggested that bacterial numbers are a strong contributing factor to granuloma structure with TNF, and TNF-dependent apoptosis can reduce infl ammation at the cost of impairing mycobacterial clearance [ 45 ] .",

Having in mind the diffi culties to generate suitable in vivo data to elucidate this question, mathematical modeling under the systems biology paradigm seems to be a good methodological option. In line with this, Kuhn's group used a Markov chain Monte Carlo model that describes cancer progression to identify and quantify the multidirectional pathways and timescales associated with metastatic spread from primary lung cancer [ 60 , 61 ] . In contrast to the traditional view of cancer metastasis as a unidirectional process starting at the primary site and spreading to distant sites as time progresses, the authors quantifi ed three types of multidirectional mechanisms of cancer progression based on large autopsy data sets: (1) self-seeding of the primary tumor, (2) reseeding of the primary tumor from a metastatic site,",

Particularly, two studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of ventilation/perfusion mismatch on hepatopulmonary syndrome and lung infl ammation, respectively. Chakraborty et al. developed a differential equation model of pulmonary oxygen uptake by considering three disparate scales, namely, micro (red blood cell), meso (capillary and alveolus), and macro (lung) [ 63 ] . The authors used the model to quantify the oxygen uptake abnormalities in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome as a result of functional intrapulmonary right to left shunting of pulmonary blood fl ow, as well as spatial heterogeneity of ventilation/perfusion mismatch in the lung. Furthermore, the quantifi ed pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities in the patients were used for stratifying them into two categories-those who are oxygen responsive and those who are oxygen nonresponsive with intractable hypoxemia. Reynolds et al. [ 64 ] developed a multi-compartment model of ODEs for gas exchange with focus on infl ammation in acute lung injury. Using the model, the authors explored effects of infl ammation on ventilation/perfusion distribution and the resulting pulmonary venous partial pressure oxygen level during systemic infl ammatory stresses.",

The model showed that patients with cystic fi brosis have a higher risk of inhaled particle accumulation and related particle overload in specifi c lung compartments than healthy subjects. Markovetz et al. built a more complex model to describe the mucociliary clearance and absorption of aerosolized radiolabeled particles and small molecular probes from human subjects with and without cystic fi brosis [ 66 ] .

On the other hand, new scientifi c insights, e.g., in the role of the microbiome and noncoding RNA, and new technological developments, e.g., the new sequencing technologies, may help us to improve our clinical performance in future. But these tremendous amounts of clinical and molecular data require a new way of organizational, technological, and intellectual cooperation between many clinical, experimental, and theoretical disciplines, called \"systems medicine.\" Many questions remain to be answered: What type and amount of clinical data do we need and can we afford to collect and analyze? What will be the role of animal models, human tissue models, complex cell culture models, or even artifi cial organs on a chip? How can we bring all these complex and multilevel data together by means of mathematics and computer science?
