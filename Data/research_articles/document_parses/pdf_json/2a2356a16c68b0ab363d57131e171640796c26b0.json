To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Considering the first symptoms, the disease was originally recorded as 'a number of pneumonia cases of unknown origins' [1] ; however, at the end of the first week of January 2020, it was identified by the Chinese authorities as a new type of coronavirus [2] later termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to other parts of China, then to neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Korea, and Japan before finally emerging in many other parts of the world [1] . Based on its sphere of influence and the growth in the number of cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 an outbreak on 11 March 2020 [3] . Until April 05, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 210 countries and territories around the world, and as of 23 May 2020, over 5.1 million confirmed cases and almost more than 330.000 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported [4] .",

            "text": "From the daily situation reports of the WHO [5] , it becomes evident how COVID-19 evolved into a global crisis in every respect and how WHO's public health strategic objectives have changed from simple to intricate measures. In parallel, basic protective measures taken by local and national authorities to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, to limit the pressure on the health care systems, and hence to curb the number of COVID-19-related causalities have been implemented all over the world. They often began with limited measures on the local level and were soon extended to the closure of national borders and, finally, severe restrictions on everyday life. Sanctions such as the closure of hotels, restaurants and other entertainment venues, the cancellation of all public meetings, the closure of schools and universities, in some places the subsequent declaration of a curfew are examples of notable measures taken to reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Aside from these structural measures, almost all national and regional governments in the world have issued different sets of recommendations or regulations, oftentimes implemented as decrees, on how its people should change their behaviour in order to decrease the risk of both contracting SARS-CoV-2 and passing it to others, especially those at particular risk for a severe course of COVID-19. For example, in Germany [6] , aside from the recommendations on hygienic measures (particularly washing hands often), these decrees comprise the avoidance of close contacts (especially staying 6 feet or two meters apart from other people) (i.e., 'social distancing'), including gathering of more than two persons, and in some federal states of Germany even encompass 'contact bans' (i.e., prohibiting the gathering of more than two persons, except those living together).",

In France, Belgium, England [8] , the USA, Germany, and New Zealand [9] , an increase in parties has been reported by the media, particularly after the closure of schools and universities.

Therefore, although the number of threads taken from Twitter is high, fewer threads were used for analysis. As the social distance topic was more recent in the social forums of YouTube and Reddit compared to Twitter, the number of threads was low, but the number of comments for each thread was high. Posts were textual, and the use of emoji and slang words on YouTube was higher than on Reddit. Texts on Twitter and YouTube included more topics on accusing authorities and politicians, distribution of income, and the impact of the social environment on the individual.

In a similar vein, it can be observed that people who do not have in-depth knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 tend to perceive precautions taken as an attack on their freedom. A survey by BVA-Doxa and Gallup conducted in mid-March 2020 on the link between the willingness to sacrifice some human rights and helping to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 shows that large percentages of the populations in six European countries (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, and Austria) support these measures.

Using social communication platforms that offer a wealth of unbiased data on selected and prioritised issues [32] , it is therefore one of the first attempts to in-depthly explore the relationship of ignoring the instructions and recommendations of the authorities on the one hand and producing a shared sense of inclusion within a limited time frame on the other hand. Some limitations also need to be considered. Only three social media websites that are widely used by the population were chosen as data sources; therefore, posts on the boards may not represent other social media forums. The current study provides a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak concerning the reactions of people to the recommendations and regulations of the authorities. However, social media users are younger than the average population and also differ in other characteristics. It therefore remains unclear to what extent our results are transferable to other population groups [33] . Since the corresponding information is not available, it was not possible to include the demographic and socio-economic information of the users in the evaluation of the social media contributions. For that reason, also, no contrasting analyses of COVID-19related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours with respect to these variables were possible.",

Human judgment, decision-making, and personal freedom in association with social conscience and shared sense were discussed as relevant issues to be considered in addressing global crises. The study reveals that transparency and a consistent approach play a key role in the development of participation-oriented measures to address global crises such as SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the steps to be taken in times of crisis. Future research should be related to how and in what ways the COVID-19 outbreak affects individuals with chronic disease. It should further explore how the impact of the lack of transparency and a consistent approach psychologically affects individuals during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study, in this respect, highlights the importance of presenting qualified information on social media, manifesting its advantages and disadvantages. The results further suggest the potential advantages and opportunities of using social media data in scientific investigations. ",
