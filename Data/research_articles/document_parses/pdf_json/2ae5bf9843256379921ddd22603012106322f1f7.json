The Gr-FET immunosensors can rapidly identify (about 2 mins) and accurately capture the COVID-19 spike protein S1 (which contains a receptor binding domain, RBD) at a limit of detection down to 0.2 pM, in a real-time and label-free manner. Further results ensure that the Gr-FET immunosensors can be promisingly applied to screen for high-affinity antibodies (with binding constant up to 2\u00d710 11 M -1 against the RBD) at concentrations down to 0.1 pM. Thus, our developed electrical Gr-FET immunosensors provide an appealing alternative to address the early screening/diagnosis as well as the analysis and rational design of neutralizing-antibody locking methods of this ongoing public health crisis.",

            "text": "Graphene field-effect transistors (Gr-FET) are very attractive for the development of immunosensors due to their unprecedented sensitivity and chemical stability with proved capability for label-free digital biomolecules detection. [4] [5] [6] Compared to optical based immunoassays including fluorescence-linked and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA and/or ELISA) technology, Gr-FET biosensors eliminate the complicated procedure for fluorescence or enzyme labeling and do not require bulky and expensive optical instruments. Thus, facile Gr-FET biosensors with high sensitivity hold great potential for rapid diagnosis and early risk prediction of infectious diseases, which often present low copy numbers in vivo pathogen. In the case of coronaviruses, it has been reported that its spike (S) glycoprotein plays an extremely important role in recognizing the cell surface receptor, which is essential for both host specificity and viral infectivity. Further studies confirms that COVID-19 infects the human respiratory epithelial cells through the S1 subunit protein, which mainly contains a receptor binding domain (RBD) interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 7 Moreover, the S protein also plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and T-cell responses, as well as protective immunity. 8 Here, to enable digital detection of the virion attachment protein of coronaviruses for fast screening/diagnosis, we combined the extremely sensitive Gr-FET with highly selective SARS-COV spike S1 subunit protein antibody (CSAb) -COVID-19 spike S1 subunit protein (which contains the RBD) antigen interaction to develop an immunosensor. Strikingly, CSAb modified Gr-FET is capable of real-time detecting S1 at a limit of detection (LOM) down to 0.2 pM concentration with a fast responding time within 2 mins. Moreover, our results indicate that CSAb modified Gr-FET possesses a higher sensitivity than its counterpart with ACE2 receptors, which can be attributed to the higher bonding affinity of CSAb to S1 (K=2\u00d710 11 M -1 ) compared to that of ACE2 (K=10 9 M -1 ). Thus, along with the capability of utilizing S1 modified Gr-FET to screening antibodies, we expand the potential utility of Gr-FET for rapid screening/diagnosis of respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses and its fast drug screening.",

The hybridization of the slightly positively charged S1 protein with CSAb/ACE2 receptors immobilized on the graphene surface, alters its conductance/resistance via field effect, which can be electrically read out. We note here that we applied a reference electrode in constant contact with the antigen buffer solution to fix its electrostatic potential (Vref) during antibody-antigen reaction, and to control the current flow in the graphene channel between the source and the drain electrodes. As CSAb is positively charged, while ACE2 is negatively charged in PBS buffer solution (pH=7.2), we applied a negative or a positive potential at graphene during the incubation process, respectively, to improve their immobilization on the sensor surface. We functionalize the graphene surface with either CSAb or ACE2 receptor, which have proved affinity for the S1 subunit protein (which contains the RBD) from coronaviruses.

To responses (\u0394Vref) monitored at varying concentrations of S1 ranging from 0.2 pM to 10 nM (added at time intervals of about 5 mins with increasing concentration). The decrease of \u0394Vref depending on the increasing concentration of S1 is consistent with the bonding of slightly positively charged molecules on the sensor surface. Such CSAb-S1 complex can be refreshed and reused with comparable performance after thoroughly rinsing with buffer solution (Fig. S3) . Additionally, repeating the same measurement when shifting the liquid-gate voltage from Vref=0 V (electron branch) to Vref=-0.2 V (hole branch), yields similar sensing behavior as expected (Fig. S4) . As a negative control, pure T20 modified Gr-FET was also tested (Fig. S5 ). Compared to the CSAb immobilized Gr-FET immunosensor, T20 passivated Gr-FET shows negligible sensing response to the target S1. Therefore, our results clearly suggest that Gr-FET signal output is specific to the immobilized CSAb-S1 complex. Strikingly, such CSAb immobilized Gr-FET immunosensors target S1 subunit protein of COVID-19 with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.2 pM, which rivals that of state-of-the-art ELISA technology but eliminating the requirements of complicated procedure for enzyme labeling or bulky/expensive optical instruments. 12, 13 We note here that there is still plenty of room for improving the LOD by innovative antibody design and/or optimal Gr-FET sensing scheme. In addition, the real-time monitoring of the \u0394Vref response ( Fig. 2a) indicates a fast response time (within 2 min) for the detection of S1, which competes the current fast FLISA and/or ELISA technologies. 13 Alternatively, ACE2 is an integral membrane protein served as functional receptor for the spike glycoprotein of human coronaviruses SARS and COVID-19 infections. We further examined the affinity of ACE2-functionalized Gr-FET in the presence of S1 subunit protein at varying concentrations (10 pM-1 \u00b5M). In contrast to CSAb, real-time measurement of ACE2-functionalized Gr-FET immunosensor (Fig. 2b) suggest that sharp increase/change of \u0394VDirac happened only when 1 nM S1 was added.",
