It shows the important role played by Professor Rao in the founding of the Indian Econometric Society, which recently held a 54-th Annual meeting in Jammu, India, attended by over 400 econometricians from all parts of India and abroad. Rao helped late Prof. P. C. Mahalanobis, his colleague and mentor at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta, in formulating economic policies of free India upon achieving independence in 1947. He encouraged sound statistical training for economists and encouraged spending resources for good economic data collection. The journal Econometric Theory paid tribute to Rao by printing a 70-page long interview with him in Bera (2003) , which includes detailed lists of Rao's 458 publications and various honors received. The Government of India acknowledged Rao's leadership in helping to improve Indian economic data collection and policy-a worthy activity for a potential Nobelist in Economics.",

Calling it a breakthrough is particularly appropriate for economists, since it had considerable influence on asymptotic econometrics. 5) Rao's new probability distributions called weighted distributions are applied in Econometrics in Vinod (1991) for studying unemployment statistics and Okun's law. 6) Maximum entropy concepts commonly used in Econometrics owe a great deal to the characterization of probability distributions developed by Rao and coauthors from Russia in Kagan et al. (1973) . 7) Rao's quadratic entropy (Rao 1991, p. 58) was motivated by trying to understand diversity between two groups by considering the average distance between two randomly chosen points. Rao's cross-entropy generalizes Kulback-Liebler 'directed divergence.' Financial economists who want to diversify their portfolios can use these divergence measures.",
