Methods: This study used publicly available data to examine gender, age, source of infection, date returned from Hubei, date of disease onset, date of first medical visit, date of final diagnosis, and date of recovery of COVID-19 cases. Results: Public-use data revealed similar risks of infection by age and that the numbers of new and final diagnoses of confirmed cases first increased, peaked at about two weeks, and then gradually decreased. The main sources of infection were firsthand or secondhand exposure in Hubei Province and contact with confirmed cases, which mostly involved contact with infected household members. The mean periods from disease onset to first medical visit, first visit to final diagnosis, and final diagnosis to recovery were 4.44, 3.18, and 13.42 days, respectively.
