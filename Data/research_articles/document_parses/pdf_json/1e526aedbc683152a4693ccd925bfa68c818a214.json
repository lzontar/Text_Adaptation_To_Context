On 31 December 2019 this was reported to the local World Health Organisation (WHO) Country Office. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organised an intensive outbreak investigation programme. The aetiology of this illness was attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus family, COVID-19, which is the acronym of 'coronavirus disease 2019'.",

            "text": "According to early data reported by the CDC from more than 44,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, death rates among patients with diabetes were 7%, compared with 0.9% for those without an underlying health condition. 4 In a separate study of 32 non-survivors, from a group of 52 intensive care unit patients with COVID-19 infection, diabetes was the second most common comorbidity (22%). 5 These finding were further corroborated by two additional studies: the first included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with 16.2% having diabetes; 6 the other study included 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection with 12% having diabetes. 7 So why are patients with diabetes considered 'high risk groups'? Human pathogenic coronaviruses bind to host target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely expressed by bronchial mucosal epithelial cells. 8 ACE2 expression is increased in diabetic patients prescribed ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs). 8 ACE2 expression is also increased by ibuprofen and thiazolidinediones and leading on from this the WHO has recommended that patients suffering COVID-19 symptoms should avoid taking ibuprofen. To date there is no consensus statement or scientific evidence suggesting thiazolidinediones should be discontinued in patients with diabetes with COVID-19 symptoms. These data suggest ACE2 expression is increased in patients with diabetes treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which may facilitate infection with COVID-19. However, on the contrary, there is evidence from animal studies suggesting that ACE inhibitors and ARBs are protective against serious lung damage in COVID-19 infection but this has not been replicated in human subjects. 9 Therefore, due to a lack of evidence supporting harmful effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the context of the pandemic COVID-9 outbreak, the Council of Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) released a position statement recommending ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued in those infected with COVID-19. 10 The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) cites two main reasons for patients with diabetes being 'high risk' for COVID-19 infection, namely, the functional immunocompromised state associated with diabetes and the favourable conditions hyperglycaemia confers towards viral replication.",
