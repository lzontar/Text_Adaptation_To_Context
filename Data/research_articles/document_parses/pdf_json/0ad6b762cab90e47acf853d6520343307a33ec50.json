Our findings are in line with this and suggest kidney infarction as a potential cause of COVID-19 associated acute kidney injury.The development of acute kidney injury despite hemodynamic stability in the presence of a mottled skin appearance and an increased LDH are possible clues pointing towards kidney infarction. No extrarenal evidence of thromboembolism was detected in case one except for a sharp rise in serum LDH levels. However, in case two, the patient did develop intestinal ischemia and digital necrosis, as an indication of arterial thromboembolic disease.Contrast-enhanced CT led to the diagnosis in both patients and is the diagnostic method of choice for the detection of kidney infarction as ultrasound of the kidneys has a much lower sensitivity10 . The logistic challenges of a CT scan for patients with COVID-19 on mechanical ventilation and the possible risks of administering contrast agents in patients with acute kidney injury are possible limitations. At the time of writing, the University Medical Center Groningen had 101 ICU admissions with COVID-19 of which 11 required renal replacement therapy, but since abdominal contrast-enhanced CT was not routinely performed, we are unable to make statements regarding the incidence of kidney infarction in COVID-19 patient with acute kidney injury at our hospitals.Thromboembolic events during COVID-19 appear to involve both the arterial and venous system[7][8][9] . However, the underlying mechanisms are currently largely unknown, but may include direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on endothelial cells leading to endothelial dysfunction 11 , pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulating tissue factor expression12 or the presence antiphospholipid antibodies leading to thrombotic events 9 . It should be noted that while we found large wedge-shaped arterial thrombi, there is also the possibility ofmicrothrombi, which may remain undetected by radiological examination. The possibility of microthrombus formation is supported by a recent post-mortem histopathological analysis of 26 patients with COVID-19, where segmental fibrin thrombus formation was found in the glomerular capillary loops of three of the patients 13 . The course in our patients suggests that initiation of anticoagulant treatment may have contributed to the improvement of kidney function in both patients and underscores the possible benefit of a timely diagnosis of kidney infarction in COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury.
