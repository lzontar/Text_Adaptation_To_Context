This data is present in various forms such as images, text, videos, links, and others and reflects user behaviours including their mental states. It is challenging yet promising to automatically detect mental health problems from such data which is short, sparse and sometimes poorly phrased. However, there are efforts to automatically learn patterns using computational models on such user-generated content. While many previous works have largely studied the problem on a small-scale by assuming uni-modality of data which may not give us faithful results, we propose a novel scalable hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) and Convolutional Neural Networks to detect depressed users on social media such as Twitter-based on multi-modal features. Specifically, we encode words in user posts using pre-trained word embeddings and BiGRUs to capture latent behavioural patterns, long-term dependencies, and correlation across the modalities, including semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). The CNN model then helps learn useful features. Our experiments show that our model outperforms several popular and strong baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-modal features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Mental illness is a serious issue faced by a large population around the world. In the United States (US) alone, every year, a significant percentage of the adult population is affected by different mental disorders, which include depression mental illness (6.7%), anorexia and bulimia nervosa (1.6%), and bipolar mental illness (2.6%) [1] . Sometimes mental illness has been attributed to the mass shooting in the US [26] , which has taken numerous innocent lives. One of the common mental health problems is depression that is more dominant than other mental illness conditions worldwide [60] . The fatality risk of suicides in depressed people is 20 times higher than the general population [54] . Diagnosis of depression is usually a difficult task because depression detection needs a thorough and detailed psychological testing by experienced psychiatrists at an early stage [39] . Moreover, it is very common among people who suffer from depression that they do not visit clinics to ask help from doctors in the early stages of the problem [66] . However, it is common for people who suffer from mental health problems to often \"implicitly\" (and sometimes even \"explicitly\") disclose their feelings and their daily struggles with mental health issues on social media as a way of relief [3, 33] . Therefore, social media is an excellent resource to automatically help discover people who are under depression. While it would take a considerable amount of time to manually sift through individual social media posts and profiles to locate people going through depression, automatic scalable computational methods could provide timely and mass detection of depressed people which could help prevent many major fatalities in the future and help people who genuinely need it at the right moment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 339, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 418, "end": 422, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 590, "end": 594, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 694, "end": 698, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 881, "end": 885, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1047, "end": 1051, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1296, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1300, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The daily activities of users on social media could be a gold-mine for data miners because this data helps provide rich insights on user-generated content.

While there are approaches which have tried to learn a model on a small-scale data, the performance of these methods is still sub-optimal. For instance, in [10] , the authors tried crawling tweets that contain depression-related keywords as ground truth from Twitter. However, they could collect only a limited amount of relevant data which is mainly because it is difficult to obtain relevant data on a large-scale quickly given the underlying search intricacies associated with the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) and the daily data download limit.

They then extracted various features representing user behaviour in social media and grouped these features into several modalities. Finally, they proposed a new model called the Multimodal Dictionary Learning Model (MDL) to detect depressed users from tweets, based on dictionary learning. However, given the high-dimensional, sparse, figurative and ambiguous nature of tweet language use, dictionary learning cannot capture the semantic meaning of tweets. Instead, word embedding is a new technique that can solve the above difficulties through neural network paradigms. Hence, due to the capability of the word embedding for holding the semantic relationship between tweets and the knowledge to capture the similarity between terms, we combine multi-modal features with word embedding, to build a comprehensive spectrum of behavioural, lexical, and semantic representations of users.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 434, "end": 438, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Recently, using deep learning to gain insightful and actionable knowledge from complex and heterogeneous data has become mainstream in AI applications for healthcare, e.g. the medical image processing and diagnosis has gained great success. The advantage of deep learning sits in its outstanding capability of iterative learning and automated optimizing latent representations from multi-layer network structure [32] . This motivates us to leverage the superior neural network learning capability with the rich and heterogeneous behavioural patterns of social media users. To be specific, this work aims to develop a new novel deep learning-based solution for improving depression detection by utilizing multi-modal features from diverse behaviour of the depressed user in social media. Apart from the latent features derived from lexical attributes, we notice that the dynamics of tweets, i.e. tweet timeline provides a crucial hint reflecting depressed user emotion change over time. To this end, we propose a hybrid model comprising Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and Conventional Neural network (CNN) model to boost the classification of depressed users using multi-modal features and word embedding features.

In general, GRU-based models have shown better effectiveness and efficiency than the other Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model [8] . By capturing the contextual patterns bidirectionally helps obtain a representation of a word based on its context which means under different contexts, a word could have different representation. This indeed is very powerful than other techniques such as traditional unidirectional GRU where one word is represented by only one representation. Motivated by this we add a bidirectional network for GRU that can effectively learn from multi-modal features and provide a better understanding of context, which helps reduce ambiguity.

Concretely, the goal of the paper is to estimate that there is a risk of user depression from their social media posts. To this end, the authors collect data from social media for a year preceding the onset of depression from user-profiles and distil behavioural attributes to be measured relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. The authors collect their data using crowd-sourcing task, which is not a scalable strategy, on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

While the authors have conducted thorough quantitative and qualitative studies, they are disadvantageous in that it does not scale to a large set of users and does not consider the notion of text-level semantics such as latent topics and semantic analysis using word embeddings. Our work is both scalable and considers various features which are jointly trained using a novel hybrid deep learning model using a multi-modal learning approach.

Their model also uses multi-modalities in data, but keep themselves confined to Instagram only. While the model in [23] showed promising results, it still has certain disadvantage. For instance, BERT vectors for masked tokens are computationally demanding to obtain even during the fine-tuning stage, unlike our model which does not have to train the word embeddings from scratch. Another limitation of their work is that they obtain sentence representations from BERT, for instance, BERT imposes a 512 token length limit where longer sequences are simply truncated resulting in some information loss, where our model has a much longer sequence length which we can tune easily because our model is computationally cheaper to train. We have proposed a hybrid model that considers a variety of features unlike these works.

We summarise the results in Table 2 and Figure 4 as follows:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 595, "end": 602, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 607, "end": 615, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"text": "\u2022 Naive Bayes obtain the lowest F1 score, which demonstrates that this model has less capability to classify tweets when compared with other existing models to detect depression. The reason for its poor performance could be that the model is not robust enough to sparse and noisy data. \u2022 \u223cMDL model outperforms SVM and NB and obtains better accuracy than these two methods.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"text": "Since this is a recent model especially designed to discover depressed users, it has captured the intricacies of the dataset well and learned its parameters faithfully leading to better results. \u2022 We can see our proposed model improved the depression detection up to 6% on F1-Score, compared to \u223cMDL model. This suggests that our model outperforms a strong model. The reason why our model performs well is primarily because it leverages a rich set of features which is jointly learned in the consolidated parameters estimation resulting in a robust model. \u2022 We can also deduce from the table that our model consistently outperforms all existing and strong baselines. \u2022 Furthermore, our model achieved the best performance with 85% in F1, indicating that combining BiGRU with CNN for multimodal strategy for user timeline semantic features strategy is sufficient to detect depression in Twitter.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experimental Results"}, {"text": "To get a better look for our model performance and how it does classify the samples, we have used the confusion matrix. For this, we import the confusion matrix module from Sklearn, which helps us to generate the confusion matrix. We visualize the confusion matrix, which demonstrates how classes are correlated to indicate the percentage of the samples. We can observe from Figure 3 that our model predicts effectively non-depressed users (TN) and depressed users (TP). We have also compared the effectiveness of each of the two attributes of our model. Therefore, we test the performance of the model with a different attribute, we build the model to feed it with each attribute separately and compare how the model performs. First, we test the model using only the multi-modalities attribute, we can observe in Fig 4 the model perform less optimally when we used BiGRU only. In contrast, the model performs better when we use only CNN with word embedding attribute. This signifies that extracting semantic information features from user tweets is crucial for depression detection. Although, the model when used only word embedding attribute outperform multi-modalities, still the true positive rate (sensitivity) for both attribute are close to each other as we see the precision score for each BiGRU and CNN. Finally, we can see the model performance increased when combined both CNN and BiGRU, and outperforms when using each attribute independently. After depressed users are classified, we examined the most common depression symptoms among depressed users. In Figure 5 , we can see symptom one (feeling depressed), is the most common symptom posted by depressed users. That shows how depressed users are exposing and posting their depressive mood on social media more than any other symptoms. Besides that, other symptoms such as energy loss, insomnia, a sense of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts have appeared in more than 20% of the depressed user.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 375, "end": 383, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1576, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Comparison and Discussion"}, {"text": "To further investigate the five most influencing symptoms among depressed users, we collected all the tweets associated with these symptoms.

Besides, using a new recently proposed popular word representation techniques also known as pre-trained language models such as Deep contextualized word representations (ELMo) [35] and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [11] , and train them on a large corpus of depression-related tweets instead of using a pre-trained word embedding model. While there will be challenges when using such pre-trained language models can introduce because of the restriction that they impose on the sequence length; nevertheless, studying these models on this task helps to unearth their pros and cons. Eventually, our future works aim to detect other mental illness in conjunction with depression to capture complex mental issues which have pervaded into an individual's life.", "cite_spans":
