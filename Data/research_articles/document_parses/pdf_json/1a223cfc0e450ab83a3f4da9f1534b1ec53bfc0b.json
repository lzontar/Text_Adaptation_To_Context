IAVs pose a threat, particularly to human health, through the continual emergence of seasonal epidemics and occasional global pandemics (Krammer et al., 2018; Paules and Subbarao, 2017) . The epidemiological ''success'' of IAVs depends on their ability to efficiently infect and subsequently transmit among host individuals, typically via airborne respiratory droplets (Killingley and Nguyen- Van-Tam, 2013; Neumann and Kawaoka, 2015) . To combat this danger, significant resources have been deployed to establish global networks for detecting, sequencing, and surveilling potentially hazardous IAV strains, both within humans and other species (Ziegler et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Human IAVs comprise three strains: H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, which were introduced into the population from avian and swine species during pandemic outbreaks over the last century (Garten et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Webster et al., 1992) . While hemagglutinins (HAs), from human IAVs bind specifically to N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) linked a2-6 to galactose (Neu5Aca2-6Gal) present on human upper airway cells, HAs from avian IAV strains preferentially recognize a2-3-linked sialosides (Neu5Aca2-3Gal) (Connor et al., 1994; . This divergence of receptor structures and/or chemistries forms a protective ''species barrier,'' preventing transmission and circulation of avian IAV subtypes within humans without adapting to human-type receptors (de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014; Imai and Kawaoka, 2012) . The H1, H2, and H3 HAs of avian virus progenitors responsible for these pandemics required only one-or two-amino acid mutations in the receptor-binding site (RBS) to achieve a switch from avian to human-type receptor specificity (Connor et al., 1994; Tumpey et al., 2007) . In addition to well-studied specificity changes, ''humanized'' HAs have been shown to acquire other adaptations including increased thermal stability, decreased fusion-pH, and increased N-linked glycosylation (Linster et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2004) . While many of these changes reflect escape from immune responses or represent adaptative alterations to improve binding, infection, and replication in human cells, the role of additional glycans, and particularly details of their composition and structure, remain comparatively under-investigated. Indeed, only two recent literature examples report site-specific and quantitative analysis of N-linked glycans from representative influenza HAs providing limited information with regard to the impact of species of origin and evolution during passage in humans (Khatri et al., 2016; Parsons et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "Here, we report a more comprehensive site-specific analysis of N-linked glycans from contemporary IAVs comprising six evolutionarily distinct hemagglutinin subtypes: H1, H3, H5, H6, H7, and H10 from human and avian influenza viruses. We find that HA stem-domain glycosites conserved across all subtypes exhibit extensive processing of glycans from a high-mannose to complex-type, while glycosites within the head domain of human HAs, including those added incrementally over time, exhibit significant oligomannose-type glycans with minimal processing. Consistent with the presence of conserved oligomannose glycans on influenza HAs, we show that, even when present at low frequencies, a highmannose-specific lectin from Galanthus nivalis (GNL; snowdrop lectin) (Kaku and Goldstein, 1989) can be used for universal labeling and detection of whole IAVs and recombinant HAs on sialoside microarrays, without the requirement for specific antiviral reagents, such as monoclonal antibodies or antisera. Moreover, GNL was also able to inhibit receptor binding and broadly neutralize recent human H3N2 viruses with either comparable or superior potency to a panel of antiviral antibodies. Energy-minimized modeling of glycosylated crystal structures for all six representative HAs reveals conservation of both the positions and types of glycans at individual glycosylation sites, particularly within the group 1 and 2 HA phylogenetic classes (Air, 1981; Nobusawa et al., 1991) . Comparison of the glycosylated HAs suggests overall location on HA, together with local structural features surrounding the glycosites to be the major determinants of oligomannose glycoforms, rather than dense packing of multiple sites, as observed in other viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Cao et al., 2017 (Cao et al., , 2018 . Structural mapping of high-mannose glycosites in the HA of human H3N2 viruses reveals the presence of a small high-mannose patch, in close proximity to the RBS at the top of H3, accounting for the effectiveness of GNL neutralization. Insights into immune recognition of glycosylated HAs, vaccine production and development, and universal virus detection via surface glycans are discussed in light of these findings.",

            "text": "Influenza HAs from Diverse Subtypes Exhibit Substantial Differences in N-Linked Glycan Processing To investigate differences in IAV glycosylation, we performed global site-specific analysis of glycan occupancy and degree of processing from high-mannose to complex-type glycans for all potential N-linked glycosylation sites present on six representative HA ectodomains from both human and avian IAVs, including: A/California/07/2009 (pH1N1, human 2009 pandemic; Cal/07), A/ Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2, human seasonal; Vic/11), A/Viet Nam/ 1203/2004 (H5N1, avian origin; Viet/04), A/Taiwan/2/2013 (H6N1, avian origin; Tai/13), A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9, avian origin; Shang/13), and A/Jiangxi Donghu/346/2013 (H10N8, avian origin; Jiang/13). These strains were selected to include HAs from two contemporary human IAV strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and four avian IAVs, which together comprise the two major HA phylogenetic subgroups, group 1 (H1, H5, and H6) and group 2 (H3, H7, and H10). This proteomics-based method for site-specific analysis of N-linked glycan processing uses endoglycosidases to introduce mass signatures that contain either no glycan, minimally processed high-mannose or hybrid-type, or more extensively processed complex-type N-glycans. This allows a semi-quantitative assessment of the proportion of each glycoform present at each glycosite (Cao et al., 2017 (Cao et al., , 2018 .",

Conversely, the majority of glycosites present on avian-derived HAs are uniformly more processed to complex-type glycans ( Figures 1C-1F ). Interestingly, although contemporary human H3 HAs are regarded as ''highly glycosylated'' (Vic/11 has 13 potential glycosites), we observed that one position (N122) is entirely unoccupied, and a further two sites (N45 and N144) are occupied by a glycan less than 50%, suggesting that H3 HAs on an average have a more modest 11-12 fully occupied glycosites, in line with recent proposals of a HA glycan saturation limit (Altman et al., 2019) . Several poorly occupied glycosites in Vic/11 H3 and a single unoccupied site at N296 (H3 numbering, used here and throughout) in Jiang/13 H10 fall in close proximity to other glycosites in the primary amino acid sequence ( Figures  1B and 1F) . Similarly, the adjacent glycosites at positions at N278 and N289 in Cal/07 H1, N126 and N133 in Vic/11 H3, and N158 and N169 in Viet/04 H5 appear to result in minimal processing, with at least one glycosite of each pair observed as oligomannose-type ( Figures 1A-1C) . Notably, however, glycan crowding is not the only reason for under-processing of glycans since isolated glycosites at N94 in Cal/07, N165 and N285 in Vic/11, and N242 in Jiang/13 display significant proportions of high-mannose glycans ( Figures 1A, 1B , and 1F), suggesting that the architecture of the folded HA structure may also influence the extent of glycan processing. All six HAs have a conserved glycosite at N483 that is predominantly complex type (Figure 1 ), while group 1 HAs (H1, H5, and H6) contain a pair of predominantly complex glycans at N21 and N33, and group 2 HAs (H3, H7, and H10) feature a directly comparable pair of glycosites at positions N22 and N38, also found to be mostly complex type ( Figures 1A-1F) .",

GNL is a commercially available, non-Ca 2+ -dependent lectin with specificity for a1-3-linked mannoside sugars found in high-mannose type N-glycans, making it a candidate to detect HAs and IAVs in glycan array experiments. While our glycan arrays contain N-linked glycans with a Man 3 GlcNAc 2 core, GNL does not appear to be able to bind complex-type glycans with terminal sialic acids and gave minimal background reactivity with sialylated N-linked glycans on the array ( Figure S1A ; for a list of array glycans see Data S1). To assess detection of purified IAV HAs, the same panel of six human and avian HAs used for MS analysis were applied to microarrays, either as a pre-incubated complex with anti-His and AF488-labeled secondary antibodies (standard protocol, see STAR Methods) or by direct incubation of pure HA trimers on the microarray surface, followed by washing and incubation with a pre-formed complex of biotinylated GNL and AF488labeled streptavidin. Detection of bound samples via GNL staining of high-mannose glycans was comparable to that achieved with antibodies in all cases, with specificity patterns and binding fingerprints appearing qualitatively matched (Figure 2) . Furthermore, GNL detection was also able to enhance signals of weaker-binding glycans, presumably due to more robust staining of multiple high-mannose glycosites per trimer.",

Despite their distinct antigenicities, when detected with GNL, specific binding to the array was clearly observed for all virus samples (Figures S1B-S1E). Both Cal/04 and Vic/11 virus samples maintain closely matched receptor specificity to purified HA counterparts in Figures 2A and 2B . For Anhui/13 and NC/ 99, we also sought to compare glycan-specific labeling with serological methods for detection, including an antiviral mouse antibody (Anhui/13) and sheep-derived antisera (NC/99). Again, GNL reproduced receptor specificities identified by serological staining, with Anhui/13 showing mixed linkage preferences for both a2-3 and a2-6-linked N-glycans, and NC/99 appearing majority a2-6 specific with minor interactions with some a2-3 receptors (Figures S1D and S1E). Since labeling with GNL offers comparable data to antibody or antisera-based detection, this method may provide a simple future alternative for detection of HAs and IAVs in glycan-binding assays when specific antiviral reagents are not available.",

Relative to a specific anti-H1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with known MN function, GNL failed to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells from infection with Cal/04 (H1N1) virus, suggesting that the observed high-mannose glycans are located some distance from the RBS ( Figure 3A) . Conversely, however, GNL showed potent neutralization of Per/09 (A/Perth/16/2009; H3N2) compared with a control anti-H3 mAb ( Figure 3A) , indicating that at least one oligomannose site in the more-heavily glycosylated H3 head is likely suitably positioned for strong inhibition of receptor engagement. Comparable data were also obtained for HAI assays, where GNL showed successful inhibition of Per/09 only, while comparison of GNL with a panel of lectins with diverse glycan specificities revealed potent neutralization to be confined to high-mannose-targeted reagents only ( Figure S2 ).",

Selected H3N2 IAVs included: Bris/07 (A/Brisbane/10/2007), Per/09, Vic/11, Switz/13 (A/ Switzerland/9715293/2013), and HK/14 (A/Hong Kong/4801/ 2014). As expected, various mAb clones exhibited neutralization in a mainly strain-specific manner, generally favoring the parent IAV or HA against which they were raised, with the exception of anti-Vic/11 clone FR1122, which failed to neutralize any IAV tested ( Figure 3B ). All four anti-Bris/07 mAbs weakly neutralized Bris/07, while two, FR509 and 512, showed similar cross-neutralization of Vic/11 (509 and 512) and HK/14 (509 only). Correspondingly, one anti-Vic/11 mAb (FR1124) showed similar neutralizing titer against Bris/07, suggesting a shared epitope shared between the two viruses. Interestingly, despite evolving between Bris/07 and Vic/11, Per/09 appears to show little cross-reactivity with anti-Bris/07 mAbs (and vice versa), despite highly potent neutralization by both anti-Per/09 and anti-Vic/11 species ( Figure 3B ). Vic/11 was the most widely neutralized virus, revealing mainly weak titers against eight out of eleven mAbs tested. Interestingly, however, anti-Vic/11 mAbs appeared to give strongest MN titers against Per/09 virus, although observed titer differences of generally 1log or less are comparatively small within the context of this assay. In terms of broad neutralization, none of the antiviral mAb samples tested were able to neutralize all five H3N2 strains. Two anti-Vic/11 clones, FR1124 and 1125, neutralized four of five viruses with generally weak potency. Unsurprisingly, given their later appearance in evolution and likely advanced antigenic drift, Switz/13 and HK/14 were only relatively weakly neutralized-with Switz/13 sharing reactivity with closely related anti-Vic/11 mAbs, and HK/14 with one anti-Vic/11 and one anti-Bris/07 sample.",

Together, these data suggest that consideration of specific glycan epitopes within vaccine design (such methods are prominent within the HIV field [Andrabi et al., 2018] ) could enhance both efficacy and broad protection, especially within human IAV strains where glycosites accumulate and oligomannose species appear conserved across the HA head domain.",

To better understand such glycosylation differences, we set out to look at the glycosylation data for the six HAs in Figure 1 in the context of their three-dimensional structures. Due to their conformational flexibility, HA glycans are not typically found in crystal or cryo-electron microscopy structures deposited in the PDB. We therefore employed a computational approach to assign energy-minimized glycan structures and conformations de novo at glycosites on the recombinant HAs (see STAR Methods and Figure S3A ). Shown in Figure 4 are the top and side views of each of the six HA subtypes, with energy-minimized glycan structures modeled at each glycosite, and colored according to the dominant glycan type determined by MS (Figure 1 ). Predominantly high-mannose and complex-type glycans are shown in green and purple, respectively, while sites with at least 30% of each type are designated ''mixed'' and colored orange. Sites with substantial high-mannose content (green) are present only in H1, H3, and H5, and are located exclusively within the HA1 subunit, with the vast majority found adorning the antigenically dominant head domain that contains the RBS (Figures 4A-4C ). While further broad similarities among the panel are mainly confined to subgroups, e.g., within human or avian origin, or phylogenetic group 1 and 2 HAs, all six HAs contain one mainly complex-type glycan at N483 that occupies a very similar conformation (Figure 4) .",

These glycans include the comparable pairs of N21 and N33 (group 1 HAs), and N22 and N38 (group 2 HAs), N278 (H1), N285 (H3), N289 (H1 and H5), and N411 (H7 and H10) . The glycan ring appears to form a relatively closed shield, obstructing access to the top of the stem domain that forms the core of the HA membrane-fusion machinery. Within Cal/04 H1 (Figure 4A ), the ring harbors two predominantly high-mannose glycosites, N278 and N289, located immediately at the head-stem interface. A similarly located glycosite in Vic/11 H3, N285, is also predominantly high-mannose ( Figures 1B and 4B) , while N289 in avian Viet/04 H5 is 100% complex type (Figures 1C and 4C) . Although Cal/ 04 N289 is somewhat close to N278 in the primary sequence, suggestive of hindrance to processing by a-mannosidases, structural analysis suggests this region to be uncrowded in both H1 and H5 ( Figures 4A and 4C ). Sequence and structural alignments reveal subtle differences around the Cal/04 and Viet/04 N289 positions that may account for the strong divergence in attached glycoforms ( Figure 5 ). Within Cal/04 H1, the N289 glycosite comprises an ''NTS'' glycosylation sequon, compared with ''NSS'' in Viet/04 ( Figure 5A ). In the Cal/04 structure, the hydrophobic methyl group on T290 appears rotated into a small hydrophobic pocket created by the side chains of T280 and P306, leading to a rearrangement of the amino acid backbone relative to Viet/04 and an approximate 45-degree rotation of the N289 side chain in toward the protein surface ( Figures  5B and 5C ). Final energy-minimized models of the glycosylated form of Cal/04 N289 reveal that the attached glycan lies closely packed against the HA surface, rather than in an extended solvent-accessible form as for Viet/04 ( Figure 5D ), likely contributing to reduced access for processing and the consistent observation of a high-mannose species at this position. Similar structural variances are also evident for Cal/04 N94, whose location within a shallow pocket beneath the major part of the head domain and proximal to the trimer interface, appears to result in a similar high-mannose glycoform closely contacting the HA surface ( Figure S3B ).",

Interestingly, while the glycosylation profile (see Figure 1 ) of Tai/13 is most closely matched to Shang/13, the location of all four observed glycosites is most closely conserved in Viet/04 H5 ( Figures 4C and 4D) , however, the attached species vary strongly. Interestingly, structural or positional variances that might impair mannosidase processing in Viet/04, relative to Tai/13, are less readily observed than in H1 and H5, with glycan conformations in respective glycosylated structures appearing highly similar ( Figure S3C ). Within group 2 HAs, Shang/13 H7 and Jiang/13 H10 feature several matched or comparable glycosites, including predominantly complextype glycans at N22, N38, N411, and N483 ( Figures 4E and  4F ). Shang/13 and Jiang/13 also contain one comparably positioned glycan with heterogeneous occupancy at N240 and N242, respectively (N240 is 100% complex in H7, while N242 is only 51% complex in H10; Figure 1 ). Glycosylated models of N240 and N242 reveal that the attached glycoforms possess very different conformations, with Shang/13 N240 pointing directly out from the HA surface in an open conformation, while Jiang/13 N242 projects directly up toward the top of HA, and packs closely against the protein surface, potentially reducing access for processing ( Figure S3D ).",

Viet/04 possesses a complex-type glycan at N158, which projects directly out and above the molecule, and while likely an antigenic adaptation, has also been shown to be a major obstacle for a2-6 receptor binding (Herfst et al., 2012; . The top of Vic/11 H3 is densely covered by multiple glycans and contains fully occupied glycosites at N63, N126, and N133, and partially occupied species at N45 and N144, that are not observed in other HAs ( Figure 4B ). Interestingly, complex (purple), >70% high-mannose/hybridG (green), and mixed occupancy (orange) and are labeled according to the protomer they belong to (either A, B, or C; see top view). The trimer interface in each HA is defined by broken lines in top view. Unoccupied (no glycan) or unobserved (glycopeptides that could not be detected) glycan positions are not modeled. The location of the RBS is labeled for each HA and a bound Neu5Ac-Gal disaccharide (purple and yellow spheres) modeled within each for illustration. Complex, high-mannose, al and NeuAc species color schemes are according to the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) guides for Neu5Ac, mannose, and galactose, respectively. the structure and location of two significant high-mannose glycosites in Vic/11, N165 and N285, are analogous to oligomannose sites in H1 and H5 (compare Figures 4A-4C) , while a third unique site, N133, is positioned nearby, creating the appearance of a ''high-mannose patch'' ( Figure 4B ). While all three of these glycans appear close to the RBS, the modeled high-mannose glycan at N165 lies extremely nearby and appears the most likely target for neutralization by GNL. That N165 and N285 are conserved in all H3 HAs since 1968 ( Figure S4 ) also provides a rationale for observed broad neutralization within this group. All modeled high-mannose glycans in Vic/11 H3 appear to pack closely against the surface of the HA molecule, similar to those described above. Together, these data suggest a model whereby IAVs, particularly those associated with human infection, select for increased glycosylation around the HA head domain, and that evolution of predominantly high-mannose species at particular glycosites may be controlled by structural and/ or sequence features within HA itself.",

Zoonotic IAV strains adapt to transmission among human hosts initially through changes in receptor specificity, increased HA stability, replication-enhancing polymerase mutations, and, subsequently, through antigenic drift within the HA head and addition of head-domain glycans. While research in many of these areas has matured significantly during the last decade, particularly with respect to receptor specificity switching (Chen et al., 2012; de Vries et al., 2017a de Vries et al., , 2017b Srinivasan et al., 2013; Tzarum et al., 2017; Yamada et al., 2006) , details of IAV glycosylation and evolutionary or adaptive changes to the HA glycome remain poorly understood. This is in-part due to substantial technical challenges, meaning many studies employ non-sitespecific or poorly quantitative techniques to interpret glycosylation patterns, while more advanced methods have proved labor-intensive and extremely low-throughput, revealing only limited insights. Knowledge of HA glycosylation and links to antigenicity are of increasing interest, since despite long-running immunization programs, development of effective and broadly protective IAV vaccines has remained difficult and represents a major research goal (Erbelding et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated variably heterogenous glycosylation patterns within a diverse panel of HAs, ranging from minor high-mannose fractions in avian HA stem domains, to near-complete oligomannose sites within the heads of human IAV HAs. Glycoproteomics analysis and structures of glycosylated HAs highlight broad conservation as to the location of many HA glycans, while occupancy of these sites with either complex or high-mannose glycoforms appears far more diverse, particularly between avian and human examples. That highly occupied oligomannose sites are almost exclusively associated with human-adapted HAs, suggests the possibility that reduced glycan processing might be selected for as part of host adaptation. Notably, glycosites with significant oligomannose content such as N94 and N289 in H1, and N165 and N286 H3, are well-conserved since the respective emergences of both H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs in humans ( Figure S4 ). Further glycoproteomic analysis of two early H3 HAs from A/Duck/Ukraine/1/1963 (DK/ 63; avian H3 precursor) and A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (HK/68; human pandemic H3) strongly supports this possibility, revealing that both H3 precursors also contain significant high-mannose fractions at N165 and N285 ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, with significant oligomannose fractions detected at all glycosites, the avian H3 pandemic precursor DK/63 appears quite distinct from contemporary avian examples profiled. Thus, appearance of high-mannose type glycans on IAV HAs may well be more complicated than simple host origin or adaptation. However, while the H5, H6, H7, and H10 HAs investigated here do reflect avian IAVs that have been able to infect humans in isolated cases, none have yet fully evolved properties to enable sustained human-to-human transmission. Comparison of glycome profiles determined here with additional examples in the literature (Khatri et al., 2016; Mir-Shekari et al., 1997; Nakamura et al., 1980; Dopheide, 1981a, 1981b; Ward et al., 1980 ) (see Figure S5 ) further supports observations that certain high-mannose glycoforms are well-conserved in fully adapted human H1 and H3 HAs, even between very early and late examples. Together these data suggest a model where IAVs carrying high-mannose glycans may be predisposed to human adaptation, or that hostadaptive pressures may instead select for strains with potential for increased high-mannose incorporation.",

            "text": "While an exact evolutionary driver is unclear, several potential selective advantages conferred by a shift to favor high-mannose glycosylation in human IAVs can be observed. For example, modeling analyses suggest that high-mannose type glycans mostly favor close packing against the HA surface. Glycans in such a conformation have potential as a steric shield, and are suggested here since almost all glycosites with significant oligomannose fractions map to functionally important regions of HA such as key antigenic sites, and the interface of the head and stem domains which houses the membrane-fusion machinery (Blijleven et al., 2016) (Figure 4) . Steric blocking at this interface region, which has high sequence homology across all HA sub-types, would likely confer advantage on human seasonal IAV strains, biasing antibody responses to more exposed areas of the viral surface with greater tolerance to antigenic drift. Additionally, the altered presentation of glycoepitopes where high-mannose glycans are attached might also reduce immunogenicity by altering or inhibiting antibody recognition of the more recessed carbohydrate component. Increased high-mannose glycosylation may also provide a replicative advantage during infection, since treatment of MDCK cells with the ER a-mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine has been shown to lead to enhanced growth and replication (Elbein et al., 1982; Pan et al., 1983) . One recent report has suggested that this effect may center around specific induction of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, directly targeting HA biosynthesis as a potential antiviral mechanism (Frabutt et al., 2018) . Thus, evolution of glycosites with reduced accessibility of nascent glycans to mannosidases and mannosidase-like proteins could inhibit this pathway, leading to enhanced replication. Presence of oligomannose glycans on human IAV HAs may also be relevant to localization of infection within respiratory tissues. IAV infection in humans is typically initiated through exposure to airborne respiratory droplets, resulting in virus binding to a2-6-linked receptors on the surface of epithelial cells in the upper airway (Connor et al., 1994; Peng et al., 2017; Shinya et al., 2006) . It is now well established that primary innate immune defenses against influenza in the respiratory tract consist of secreted host factors, including calcium-dependent (C-type) surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D (Hartshorn et al., 1994; Nayak et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2012) . Notably, SP-D binds specifically to high-mannose type N-glycans (Goh et al., 2013) , particularly Man 9 , and confers protection against pathogens containing oligomannose. However, gene expression studies have revealed that SP-D is mainly isolated to the lung and lower respiratory tissues (Su et al., 2004) , thus human-adapted IAVs that primarily target the upper respiratory tract are able to increase high-mannose N-glycan expression while still evading host immune defenses.",

With up to thirty N-linked glycans per monomer, both HIV gp120 and MERS CoV S-2P are well-characterized examples that comprise numerous oligomannose sites arising due to close packing of their many structurally proximal glycosites (Cao et al., 2017 (Cao et al., , 2018 . By contrast, HA glycans are far fewer and appear sparsely arranged (Figure 4) , suggesting that in this case, presence of oligomannose glycans is not due to steric restrictions imposed by neighboring glycan chains. We have found that appearance of glycosites with significant high-mannose incorporation in HA is more strongly associated with global placement on the molecule, particularly when located within the head domain, and with local structural and/or sequence adaptations that serve to alter the positioning or conformation of the attached glycan. Observations that some high-mannose glycans span the gap between protomers within the HA trimer, notably N165 in Vic/11 H3 and N169 in Viet/04 H5 (Figure 4 ), also suggests a potential role in stabilizing subunit interactions and has been posited for influenza NA (Nagae and Yamaguchi, 2012) .",
