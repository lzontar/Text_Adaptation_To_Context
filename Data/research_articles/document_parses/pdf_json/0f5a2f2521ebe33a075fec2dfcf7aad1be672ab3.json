Given the magnitude of the school-aged child population, a sizeable proportion of influenza virus transmission events are expected to occur within school settings. However, influenza virus activity in schools is not wellunderstood, likely due to our limited ability to accurately monitor for respiratory viruses without disrupting the school environment. In this study, we evaluated the use of a bioaerosol sampling method to noninvasively detect and quantify airborne influenza A virus (IAV) densities in a public elementary school. Air samples were collected from multiple locations in the school, two days per week, throughout an eight-week sampling period during influenza season. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the IAV M gene revealed detectable IAV on five occasions in densities ranging from 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u22121 to 1.9 \u00d7 10 4 . No significant differences in IAV densities were related to student presence/absence. The majority of IAVassociated particles were \u22644 \u03bcm in diameter, and theoretical calculations indicate infectious thresholds after minutes of exposure.

Infection could have also arisen from breathing for 3 minutes in the gymnasium on Day 80, but is less likely, as particles were >4 \u03bcm in diameter. While no specific activity can explain elevated IAV densities in the classroom, two defined activities in the gymnasium throughout the school day are thought to promote elevated IAV densities. First, the gymnasium is used by approximately 25 students during each class period for physical education instruction. Physical activity/exercise can result in aerosolized IAV through increased respiratory rates, and increased respiratory distress due to bronchoconstriction 39 , which has been demonstrated to affect up to 16% of children 40 . Second, the gymnasium hosts the student lunch period, which lasts for 50 minutes, during which two cohorts (approximately 235 students each) eat for 25 minutes. The entire student body is not only represented in the gymnasium during the lunch period, but is also moving, en masse, as each cohort enters and exits the space, theoretically creating turbulence to maintain suspension of IAV (if present) throughout the period, and likely into the post-lunch hours.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1057, "end": 1059, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1124, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Airborne IAV densities were highest in the school corridor, which was expected, and can be partially explained by two factors. First, student lockers are situated along the walls of the corridor which encourages air turbulence as students pass through the corridor and open and shut locker doors. Second, the corridor represents the only available passage between classrooms and therefore each student passes through the corridor multiple times per day, which dually increases the probability that an infectious student will shed virus in the area, and that other students will be exposed. In a college student office setting, Zhang and Li (2018) 41 demonstrated that the frequency of close contact (within 1 m) is 9.64 contacts per hour per student, which contributed to 45% of reported IAV infections. Additionally, previous studies have suggested that influenza illness and death rates could be decreased by as much as 50% by reducing the contact rates of infected persons 42 .

Therefore, in the school, lower IAV densities and high variability were anticipated, and sampling parameters were chosen to maximize detection, including short sampling durations to preserve the integrity of captured IAV RNA. We chose a flow rate of 3.5 L/min for four hours at a time, which was previously demonstrated to efficiently capture and preserve airborne IAV RNA for RT-PCR detection 37, 38 .

We did not collect individual student health data during the study, and therefore could not definitively link the prevalence of influenza among the student population with virus detections. However, the detection of IAV during the absence of all students from the building was nonetheless an important observation, indicating persistence of the virus in the airshed. Airborne IAV can remain viable for up to 36 hours 52,53 and is likely facilitated by two factors. First, it has been demonstrated that temperature and RH influence the viability and transmission of influenza viruses [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . However, research has recently demonstrated that RH does not influence influenza virus viability 59 , but rather the rate of aerosol deposition, which influences the concentration of virus particles in the air. In the current study, the environmental conditions during the school day (19-29% RH and 20-23 \u00b0C) were optimal for IAV persistence. Second, children shed IAV for a longer duration than adults shed the virus 60 , encouraging prolonged IAV aerosolization in a school setting where children predominate.
