Organisations have had to adopt new information technology (IT) systems during the pandemic, while others have had to completely rethink their business model, moving to online services and products and engaging in new business channels to those eroded or removed by the pandemic.

To this end, planning for, implementing, embedding, and integrating technology to facilitate new norms is incredibly challenging. To exacerbate this, there is a lack of any guidance from governments or policymakers on how to best facilitate these unprecedented changes to work practices. This research described the application of NPT and its usefulness in offering (i) a novel theoretical perspective on the normalisation of new technology-driven work practices, and (ii) practical insights on how NPT can better guide organisations to normalise technology-driven work practices during pandemics. It is envisaged that this framework will explain the implications of pandemics and debate about the normalisation of new tech-driven work practices and transformations.
