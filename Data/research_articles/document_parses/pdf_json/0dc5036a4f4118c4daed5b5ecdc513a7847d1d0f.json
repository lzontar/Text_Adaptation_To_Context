He was treated with O 2 at different volumes (up to 60% FiO 2 VM), lopinavir/ritonavir (200/50 mg, 2 tablets \u00d7 2/day), hydroxychloroquine (400 mg b.i.d on the first day, and 200 mg b.i.d afterwards), enoxaparin 6000 IU b.i.d., methylprednisolone (starting dose 40 mg b.i.d, lately tapered).

Our hospital required two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests, plus normal body temperature, resolution of respiratory symptoms, with the improvement of lung imaging. The two nasopharyngeal swabs collected on March 30 and 31 were both negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was therefore discharged and encouraged to maintain home quarantine for at least 14 days. The molecular test was also negative at his follow-up visit on April 15, suggesting that the patient was cured from COVID-19. In addition, two serological assays (VivaDiag\u2122, VivaChek Laboratories, INC, USA and Anti SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG Test, Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany) revealed the presence of IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. However, on April 30, he developed new symptoms, i.e., dyspnea and chest pain. He visited again the Emergency Department where he was re-admitted to the same ward with a suspicion of a pulmonary embolism that was confirmed by CT scan. The imaging showed the presence of segmental and sub-segmental signs of arterial microembolism with some parcel area of ground glass. Because of his recent clinical history, a SARS-CoV-2 molecular test was performed and proved to be positive. Moreover, serological assay revealed the presence of only IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. To date, the patient is well, on anticoagulant therapy and does not require O 2 supplementation.",

Nevertheless, the case we describe points to a real reactivation of the infection since the molecular test became positive again following three previous negative tests in one month. In a recent paper, Ye et al. reported a 9% proportion of reactivation in COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital [3] . Risk factors of reactivation would probably include host status, virologic features and, for example, steroid-induced immunosuppression [3] . The possibility of a reactivation of COVID-19 poses a major public health concern since it could significantly contribute to the spread of the virus in the population. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days applies to all COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge, but a clear definition of the infectiousness timing and duration of viral shedding is still lacking [4] . Presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers may be infectious [5], but we should consider that also the convalescent may transmit the virus [2] . Further investigations should better define the most appropriate quarantine period, to avoid transmission [4] . This case had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, indicating that the acute phase of the disease was exceeded. Preliminary evidences suggest that antibody responses occur in those who have been infected [6] . If these antibodies are protective and how long their protection will last, is yet to be established. According to the present report, we could speculate that in some cases the presence of IgG antibodies is not protective.",
