A group of individuals, who can be called responsive individuals, will be safe from the risk of drug abuse, by receiving and understanding such information. In this paper, by proposing mathematical models, we investigate the effect of the distribution of this kind of information on the transformation of susceptible individuals into responsive individuals as well as their effect in preventing the occurrence of substance abuse epidemics. In these models, we take into account the fact that the spirit of responsiveness of these individuals can be decayed with time, and these people can become susceptible people, and eventually to addicts. We analyze the dynamical properties of the models, such as local and global stability of equilibrium points and the occurrence of backward bifurcation. The results of this study show that the higher the rate of conversion of susceptible individuals to those responsive, the prevention of drug epidemy is easier.",

In some infectious disease such as sexually transmitted diseases, i.e., STDs, Pandemic Influenza, and SARS, the diffusion of information through targeted campaigns, various media resources and individual to an individual contact, can alert the population to the spreading disease.

Occurrence of backward bifurcation is also proved for the model which shows, under some conditions, it is not enough to reduce R 0 to the region R 0 < 1, to control the drug epidemy. In fact, when R 0 < 1, the drug problem may be persistent.

At first, we considered a model without treatment/rehabilitation compartment. A complete qualitative study of this model including the existence and local and global stability of the equilibrium points are carried out. The drug-free equilibrium P 0 was shown to be locally and globally stable if R 0 < 1, and the endemic equilibrium point exists and is locally and globally stable if R 0 > 1. Then, we considered a model with a compartment for the individuals under treatment/rehabilitation programs. This model shows more complexity, in fact, endemic equilibrium may exist (up to 3 point), in cases, R 0 < 1, R 0 = 1 and R 0 > 1. Occurrence of backward bifurcation is also proved for the model. The backward bifurcation analysis showed that, if the relapse rate exceeds a certain value, then the backward bifurcation will occur. The occurrence of backward bifurcation makes it harder to control the infection, in fact, to prevent the epidemic from occurring, the reducing of R 0 to the region R 0 < 1, is not enough.",

However, at the same time, (3.9) showed that increasing the parameters \u03b1 s and \u03b1 l , or decreasing the parameters k and d, increases the amount of the threshold necessary for the occurrence of backward bifurcation, which makes the occurrence of backward bifurcation harder, and hence, it makes the infection control easier.",

In this case, z = |z 2 | + |z 3 |, andfrom |z 1 | < |z 2 |, we have:Case 5: z 2 < 0 < z 1 , z 3 and |z 1 | + |z 3 | > |z 2 |. In this case, z = |z 1 | + |z 3 |, andCase 6: z 2 < 0 < z 1 , z 3 and |z 1 | + |z 3 | < |z 2 |. In this case, z = |z 2 |, andfrom |z 1 | + |z 3 | < |z 2 |, we have:Case 7: z 3 < 0 < z 1 , z 2 and |z 1 | + |z 3 | > |z 2 |. In this case, z = |z 1 | + |z 3 |, andCase 8: z 3 < 0 < z 1 , z 2 and |z 1 | + |z 3 | < |z 2 |. In this case, z = |z 2 |, andsince |z 1 | + |z 3 | < |z 2 |, we have:Now, using the supposed inequalities, in all of the above cases, the coefficient of ||z|| is a negative number, and hence, there exists \u03c7 > 0, with D + z \u2264 \u2212\u03c7 z for all z \u2208 R 3 . Lemma 3.1 and a proof similar to corollary 5.4 in [1] , implies the following theorem.Theorem 3.2 If the inequalities (3.11) hold, positive semi-trajectories of system converge to an equilibrium point, i.e., any \u03c9-limit point of system in \u2022 , is an equilibrium point.Finally, the above theorem implies the following result. 1. when the only equilibrium point is the drug-free equilibrium P 0 , then all solutions tend to P 0 ;",
