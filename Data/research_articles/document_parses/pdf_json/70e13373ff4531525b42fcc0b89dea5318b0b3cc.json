As a result, the aquaculture industry has continuously increased profits in a high rate. However, outbreaks of diseases caused by infectious agents are significantly restricting intensified aquaculture. According to literature 3 , 22.6% of all disease outbreaks are caused by viruses. Among these, viral nervous necrosis (VNN), also named vacuolating encephalopathy and retinopathy or encephalomyelitis, is a devastating disease, which induces cell necrosis accompanied by vacuolation in fish retina and brain. Its clinical symptoms include changes in skin color with abnormal swimming, low feed ingestion and altered buoyancy in affected fish. The disease is caused by nervous necrosis virus (NNV) or nodavirus, affecting more than 30 different fish species, worldwide. VNN causes high mortalities (80-100% in several species e.g. European sea bass), emerging as a major problem especially in the Mediterranean area, since it cannot be prevented by vaccination or effective treatment 4-6 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Fish nervous necrosis virus (belonging to Betanodavirus genus and Nodaviridae family) is icosahedral, and non-enveloped (\u223c25 nm in diameter).

The samples supernatants were applied directly to the nodavirus biosensors, which were run and scanned.

All tested samples were verified with SSN-1 cell culturing. Five samples were originated from Saronikos Gulf area (S1, 2, 6, 8, 9), 2 samples were from Korinthian Gulf region (S3-4), 1 sample was collected from Amvrakikos Gulf (S7) and 3 samples were originated from aquacultures in Cyprus (S5, 10, 11).

The use of the cell culture supernatant in an amount corresponding to the assays detection limit was intended to be used as a visual \"yardstick\", a comparison measure to indicate which signal could be positive. If the positive control was intended to be used just to confirm the LFBs' proper operation more supernatant could be applied to provide more intense signal.

The development of a highly promised robust and rapid lateral flow biosensor has been reported in the present study.

To enable on site analysis of nodavirus, we developed and optimized a paper LFB based on gold nanoparticles for easy, specific and sensitive visual detection of nodavirus viral particles (virions) in biological samples. The target virions can be simply detected by the red colored signal formation in the LFBs test zone. The LFB permits the visual detection of nodavirus particles within 30 minutes without using any instrumentation. The total assay starting including tissue homogenization, centrifugation and virion detection with the biosensor was accomplished in less than 60 min. The total cost of the assay is less than 3 \u20ac. Undergoing studies by our research group include complete validation of the nodavirus biosensor on fish culture facilities, and efforts to improve the biosensors' sensitivity of the LFB utilizing dual nanoparticles labels 26, 41 and signal enhancement systems in general. Moreover, the elimination of centrifugation from the sample preparation step is among our future goals to further simplify nodavirus detection on-site. Concluding, the proposed biosensor could become a reliable tool for the rapid screening of questionable samples in aquaculture facilities.
