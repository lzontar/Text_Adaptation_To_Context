The knowledge transfer mainly depends on task relationships. Most of existing multi-task learning methods guide learning processes based on predefined task relationships. However, the associated relationships have not been fully exploited in these methods. Replacing predefined task relationships with the adaptively learned ones may lead to superior performance as it can avoid the misguiding of improper predefinition. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Task Relation Attention Networks to adaptively model the task relationships and dynamically control the positive and negative knowledge transfer for different samples in multi-task learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments on various datasets are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art multi-task learning baselines.",

In MTL, positive knowledge transfer leads to improved performance, because: 1) more related information is incorporated into the target tasks, which benefits the feature learning process to obtain better feature representations; 2) the incorporated information of positively related tasks acts as regularizer to avoid the risks of over-fitting. The knowledge transformer mainly depends on the task relationships. Therefore, how to appropriately model task relationships and how to control the knowledge transfer among tasks are crucial in MTL. With the recent advances in deep learning, MTL with deep neural networks has been used widely and successfully across many applications of machine learning, from natural language processing [7] to computer vision [11] . In most of these existing methods, the task relationships guiding the learning process are generally predefined, and the knowledge transfer among tasks relies on the sharing of hidden layers. Despite they have achieved promising results, but there are still several challenges for further improving the performance of MTL methods.",

For some multi-task learning problems with complex task associations, the pre-definition based on limited human knowledge requires costly human efforts. Besides, if there are not adequate efforts for sophisticated pre-definitions, there is likely to be negative knowledge transfer because of the misguiding of improperly predefined task relationships [8, 16] . Since an improper pre-definition of task relationships may result in negative knowledge transfer, it is essential for MTL methods to adaptively and appropriately model the task relationships with learning-based modules.",

The relationships among tasks are not constantly fixed, but vary slightly from different samples. However, in most of the methods relying on pre-definition, the task relationships are fixed [9] , even in some MTL methods equipped with adaptively learning modules [14] . A concrete example is, in the works of [21] , the task relationships are determined by the inputs X and outputs Y of training data. In the testing phase, the model directly performs predictions on the learned relationships and the inputs X test , i.e., the relationships are fixed for the testing data. However, the task relationships in different samples may not be necessarily consistent. Therefore, dynamically modeling these relationships based on different inputs may lead to superior performance.",

For leveraging the task relationships in MTL, there are some recent examples. The cross-stitch networks [14] learned an optimal combination of task-specific representations for each task using linear units.

The average relative improvements of MH-TRAN in all tasks are 4.68% (L2-Norm), 5.78% (CSN) and 2.45% (MMoE) for Census-income dataset, 2.94% (L2-Norm), 1.68% (CSN) and 2.85% (MMoE) for FashionMnist dataset and 67.95% (L2-Norm), 55.09% (CSN), 40.50% (MMoE) and 25.29% (MRAN) for Sarcos dataset.Comparison Between Different MTL Methods. Compare with TRAN, both CSN and MMoE are based on linear models, and MMoE model task relationships implicitly, while our method is based on attention networks to explicitly model task relationships. The fact that TRAN outperforms CSN and MMoE, indicating the advantages of our method. Besides, compared with statically modeling task relationships (MRAN), TRAN is able to dynamically control the knowledge transfer, and the fact that TRAN outperforms MRAN demonstrates the effectiveness of this key component. Although MRAN includes different types of relationships, our method still outperforms it with the relative improvements of 25.29%.",
