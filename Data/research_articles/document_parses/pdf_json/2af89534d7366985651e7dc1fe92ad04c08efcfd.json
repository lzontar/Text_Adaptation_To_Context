In Italy the first person-to-person transmission was reported on February 21 st , 2020, in Lombardia 5 region, causing so far one of the most extensive outbreaks in Europe. As of May 4 th , 2020, the total number of cases in Italy was 211,938, with 29,079 deaths and the estimated percentage of infected persons was 4,76% (4,28%-5,37%), that means almost 5.000.000 people [1, 2] . The near totality of elective non-oncologic procedures has been postponed by the end of February to increase capacity for in-patient beds and acute care [3] . 10 The elderly, especially those with a higher rate of comorbidities, were the most severely affected population [4] . It seems that the increased prevalence of obesity in older adults in Italy compared to Chinese population may account for the differences in mortality between the two countries. Thus, the rising prevalence of obesity in the US and prior experience of the impact of obesity on mortality from H1N1 flu should increase the sensitivity of clinicians caring for patients 15 with obesity and COVID-19 for the need for aggressive treatment [5] .",

Robust data show a link between the BMI and the need for hospitalization and ICU admission in positive patients younger than 60 years [6] . A French study on 124 patients in ICU reports that obesity and morbid obesity affected 47.6% and 28.2% of COVID-19 cases respectively. [7] .

The secondary aim of the paper was to present the proposal of selection criteria for elective obesity surgery in the phase 2 based on Delphi modified process [24] The proposed patient's selection criteria for obesity surgery during phase 2 in Italy follow: The patient should arrive at the hospital 24 -48 hours before hospitalization: outside the hospital, the medical staff must repeat the interview as above and swab the patient. In the case of a positive swab, surgery must be suspended. In the case of negativity, the patient must sign a specific 145 consent, after which the operation can be carried out with hospitalization on the same day of the procedure.",

We gathered a group of eight high-volume Italian bariatric centers, which during January and February 2020 performed 840 bariatric procedures. Out of the eight centers, five were in regions with high infection rates [Lombardia (2 centers), Veneto, Piemonte, Emilia Romagna], and 3 in areas with an infection rate closer to the national average [Toscana, Lazio (2 centers)]. A structured phone 45 interview was administered to all the patients operated during that period. We found five infections [5,9 cases out of 1000 inhabitants], four in Lombardia and one in Veneto. In the two regions, the overall rate of infection on May 2 nd , 2020, was similar [7,190 out of 1000 inhabitants] [1]. Among infected patients, two had mild symptoms with home care management, and three were hospitalized for fever and dyspnea; none died. Four out of five cases were over 60 years, and three out of five 50 cases, reported an extra-hospital contact with positive COVID-19 people. The five cases made a full recovery with a negative swab. In the same group of patients we recorded the rate of post-operative complications comparing it with the same rate of subjects undergone to bariatric procedures in the eight centers during the same period of the year before [2019]. Out of the 840 patients of the 2020 we registered 55 14 severe complications [Clavien-Dindo III: 12 cases, Clavien-Dindo IV: 2 cases]. In 2019 out of the 836 patients submitted to bariatric surgery, 12 developed post-operative complications, all class III according the Clavien-Dindo classification, showing a similar outcome when compared to 2020 results [chi-square test 0.1467, p-value .701685]",

The re-start of elective bariatric surgery should be progressive and prudent, with proper patient selection based on the lesson learned during the phase 1. An expert panel of bariatric surgeons and infectious disease specialist agree on the patient's selection criteria, in and out of hospital protocol, to minimize the risk of Covid-19 175 infection in phase 2. From July 2020, all the data of the bariatric cases performed in the eight centers will be collected in a prospective database, to monitor the postoperative course of the patients until the WHO will declare the end of the pandemic. Nonetheless, high-volume centers must take responsibility to plan the new scenario to continue their surgical and clinical activity, respecting the patient safety and the need for the cure of morbid obesity, which was considered, 180 before the Covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic of the Third Millennium. Nevertheless, criteria of prioritization of access to diabetes surgery are matter of debate [17]. In summary, the deliverance of transparent information to the patients and the introduction of the Covid-19 protocol concerning patients and health-professionals protection, seem to guarantee in Italy a safe re-start of elective laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The establishment of a network of 185 high-volume centers sharing information and protocol in this \"unexplored\" period is a guarantee for the safety of patients. Patients with severe obesity usually have multiple comorbid conditions, which would make them vulnerable to a severe form of Covid-19. Bariatric surgery induces a postoperative amelioration of those comorbidities reducing the risk in case of a second outbreak while waiting for 190 the anti-Covid-19 vaccination.
