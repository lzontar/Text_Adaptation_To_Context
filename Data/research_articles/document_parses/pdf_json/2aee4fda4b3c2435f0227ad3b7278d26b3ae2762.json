Here we only discuss the practical aspects related to (i) and (ii), and briefly comment on the sources of uncertainty (iii). Sources of uncertainty. The previous estimates (risk predictions, decision threshold) are subject to uncertainties which can be due to sampling bias (e.g. clinical trial data used are not reflecting population data or electronic medical records failing to account for the part of the population who was never admitted to the hospital) or methodological bias (model misspecification, suboptimal machine 455 learning/statistical method used). In order to provide statistical guarantees on the estimators obtained, it is necessary to compute confidence bands on the estimated ROC curve which will then lead to explicit confidence bands on the decision parameters of the risk prediction strategy. Typical approaches to derive confidence bands are to perform error propagation on distribution parameters 460 (in a parametric framework), or to generate several ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves through resampling and provide some bootstrap estimate of the confidence band. 42 Resampling strategies may include label flipping (prediction uncertainty), sample perturbation or shifting (sampling bias).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1813, "end": 1815, "text": "42", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 72, "end": 91, "text": "(Figures 4(a, c, e)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 138, "end": 157, "text": "(Figures 4(b, d, f)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": ".

For the less strictly isolated population (the lower 205 risk one -\u03b4 r = 0 \u00b7 1 or 0 \u00b7 2 inFigure 3), the results are more intricate. It is also better to isolate more strictly, except when the risk prediction model is of very high quality and people of high risk are in stricter isolation.
