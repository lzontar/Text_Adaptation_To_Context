Together with the exponential rate presented in the baseline scenario, we model the decay rate via a sigmoid function, using a Gompertz model [1] , and via a constant function. As shown in Figure S1 , we set these models to have the same values after 4 days, representing the decrease in viral load induced by Remdesevir in as study on MERS [2] . Final size and peak incidence are not affected by the tested decay rates as shown in Figure S2 . Figure S1 .
