The recursive multiple-step forecasting involved using a one-step model multiple times where the prediction for the preceding time step was used as an input for making a prediction on the following time step. For example, for forecasting the number of the new confirmed cases for the one more next day, the predicted number of new cases in one-step forecasting would be used as an observational input in order to predict day 2. Repeat the above process to obtain the two-step forecasting. The summation of the final forecasted number of the new confirmed cases for each province/city was taken as the prediction of the total number of the new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China. Clustering The values of the latent variables in the second latent layer of the MAE for each province/city were extracted. For each province/city, a 34 \u00d7 4 dimensional latent matrix were formed. The largest single value of the latent matrix was obtained via single value decomposition. We performed five-time trainings and obtained five largest single values. For each province/city, we 8 formed a feature vector that consisted of the five largest single values , the starting day and the forecasted end day of the Covid-19 outbreak, the day, the number of new confirmed cases reaching the maximum, the largest number of the forecasted new confirmed cases and the number of the forecasted accumulated confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the respective province/city. The k-means algorithms were performed on the 34 feature vectors to group provinces/cities into clusters. Results Figure 2 plotted the total number curves of the reported and forecasted cumulative and new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in China as a function of days.

Clustering its temporal dynamics will provide numerous insights on patterns of propagation of Covid-19. To further capture the dynamic pattern of Covid-19 spread across the provinces/cities, we presentedFigure 4 where 34 provinces/cities formed nine clusters. Since the spread of Covid-19 was influenced by the pattern of contacts between individuals, clusters partially showed geographic structure. For example, Hubei province, a major source of Covid-19, formed a cluster. Followed by the Anhui, Guangdong, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and Zhejiang, which are in areas surrounding pathogen sources (Hubei province).

However, we have not explored such functions of the MAE due to lack of data. Similar to epidemiologic transmission dynamic models, the MAE can also be used for simulations. The trained MAE can well approximate many dynamic processes. Using the hypothesized initial sizes of the epidemic outbreak, we can use the MAE with known parameters and architecture to estimate the sizes of 11 outbreak in the future and simulate the impact of the interventions on the sizes and severity of the epidemics.
