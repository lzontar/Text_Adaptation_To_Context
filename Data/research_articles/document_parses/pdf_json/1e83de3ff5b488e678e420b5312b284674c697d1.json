            "text": "Clinicians have a complex task when attempting to identify infectious disease aetiologies, particularly in critically ill patients. Current diagnostic practices typically detect and report single pathogen analysis from individual patient samples, often being curtailed when a pathogen is detected. Adopting a syndromic approach for the rapid identification of infection(s) would not only change current clinical diagnostic practices but also provide a rapid diagnostic tool to inexpensively supply evidence of specific infections and super-infections, particularly in paediatric, critically ill and immunosuppressed patients. Test selection may be based on limited information and therefore screening for many relevant pathogens may not occur, simply because they were not requested by the referring clinician, consequently infectious aetiologies can remain unidentified. Delays may also occur if reference laboratories are required to run tests for less common pathogens, greatly increasing the turn-around time for results. The patient may remain for extended periods on broad-spectrum therapy pending the results of different tests, with the associated increased drug toxicity, unwarranted selective pressure for antibiotic resistance, cost and length of hospital stay. There is, therefore, a great need to simplify complex workflows for pathogen detection and identification to allow the rapid initiation of tailored treatment regimens.",

PCR and, more recently, real-time PCR have revolutionised diagnostic practices in clinical microbiology laboratories (Bankowski & Anderson, 2004; Cockerill, 2003; Mackay, 2004) , allowing rapid pathogen identification. The combination of excellent sensitivity and specificity, low contamination risk, speed, reduced hands on time and ease of use has made real-time PCR technology an appealing alternative to conventional culture-based or immunoassay-based testing methods, which are often time consuming and labour intensive. As a direct result of the introduction of realtime PCR into clinical microbiology, turn-around times have decreased considerably with obvious benefits at the bedside. The use of molecular diagnostics has proven advantageous resulting in more accurate results with overall better patient care and outcomes.",

Array technology has revisited monoplex assays but utilising them as 'simultaneous singleplex' to detect many more pathogens from the full spectrum of organisms, thus introducing a syndromic rather than pathogen-focused approach to diagnosis. The TaqMan \u00ae Array Card (TAC) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) formally known as TaqMan \u00ae Low-density Array (TLDA) is a microfluidic card which utilises primers and probes pre-loaded and lyophilised onto wells. The TAC platform offers a 384-well, single-plate real-time PCR in an 8 sample by 48-well format with a single target tested in each of 48 available wells/pods (including controls). Microfluidic technology distributes the sample into individual PCRs and real-time PCR and detection takes place within an analyser (ViiA7 or QuantStudio 7) with results generated in less than 1 h. The process and individual steps involved in setting up a card are schematically outlined in Figure 1 .",

This relies on clinical judgement; however, the cycle threshold (Ct) value at which a particular organism is detected on the TAC (and which represents the relative amount of that organism within the sample) can aid in this interpretation.

There is the possibility to include assays for antibiotic and anti-viral resistance relevant to a particular organism/syndrome, for example, carbapenamases or oseltamivir resistance. This technique can also be used in surveillance for pathogens which are not sought routinely, for example, toroviruses, kobuviruses and parvoviruses in gastrointestinal disease. Array cards can be used in outbreak response, for example, with respiratory outbreaks whereby outbreak specimens can be rapidly tested for multiple respiratory pathogens allowing for rapid initiation of appropriate public health response, implementation of infection control precautions and prophylaxis/treatment where necessary.",

The initial step was to transform all assays to a single monoplex format, with high specificity and sensitivity while using identical reaction conditions, chemistry, probes with the same reporter fluorophore and quencher. Although each assay had previously been extensively validated, the changes required for transformation to TAC assays necessitated re-optimisation and validation. This opportunity provided a chance to re-evaluate each assay individually and perform BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.gov/Blast) of primers and probes to ensure specificity (utilising recently deposited sequences in the GenBank database); to examine primer and probe melting temperatures (T m ) and whether any adverse primer/probe dimer and heterodimer interactions existed using OligoAnalyzer 3.1 (www.idtdna. com) that required modification. In some instances, the primers needed to be modified at the 5 0 end (adding target-matched extensions) to raise their T m to approximately 55-60\u00b0C to ensure uniform amplification across 48 different assays at the single defined temperature (60\u00b0C). Ideally, the amplicon length should be between 60 and 150 nucleotides but we have had acceptable results with amplicons up to 200 nucleotides in length. A huge benefit is that once validated on the TAC format, an assay can be incorporated into any syndromic TAC.",

These probes have proven to generate better precision in quantitation due to a lower background signal. Further, the MGB moiety stabilises the hybridised probe, effectively raising the melting temperature (T m ), and increasing specificity. MGB probes can therefore be shorter than traditional dual-labelled probes, making them better suited for applications such as allelic discrimination, or when designing probes in regions of high AT content, for genotyping or when designing assays to detect mutations conferring drug resistance. The majority of assays using traditional dual-labelled quenchers transfer to the MGB format with minimal re-optimisation required; indeed, in many cases the shorter MGB probes increase the sensitivity and efficiency of the reaction, as well as the amplitude of the fluorescence signal giving high rising sigmoidal amplification curves. In our experience, designing the T m of the MGB probe to be between 48 and 55\u00b0C works effectively with probe lengths ranging from 14 to 24 nucleotides.",

The Fast Virus 1-Step mastermix amplifies both RNA and DNA with high sensitivity allowing for mix-and-match RT-PCR and PCR on any TAC. It has an added benefit of retaining high sensitivity even in the presence of RT-PCR inhibitors often found in blood, stool and other typically inhibitory specimens. Although not essential, for ease of use, we chose to have one cut-off threshold value for all assays on each developed TAC (Figure 2) .

A range of sample types including plasma, stool, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, naso-pharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), CNS, fresh biopsy tissue and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens may be included in assay optimisation. Extraction volumes can also be optimised and increasing the volume can be beneficial when low levels of pathogen are suspected, e.g., very early or late in the infection. An internal control such as bacteriophage MS2 (or Bacillus thuringiensis cells) should be included in all extraction protocols to serve as a process control (Rolfe et al., 2007) . The next step is to transfer the assays to a 384-well PCR plate format using fast reaction conditions (see Figure 1 ) on the ViiA7 and determine sensitivity, specificity and LODs for each assay, again using known standards and patient samples. Although a larger volume (20 ml) is used in the 384-well PCR plate format on the ViiA7, it does provide a good indication of how assays will perform on a TAC (1 ml reaction volume) due to the proximity to the fluorescence detectors within the ViiA7 instrument.",

Employing such a combination allows for optimal assay scrutiny, providing information on LOD, sensitivity, specificity and any reaction inhibitors from different sample types. NEQAS and QCMD panels provide a good indication if a generated TAC is of sufficient sensitivity to be used in an accredited diagnostic service. A panel of engineered plasmid controls can serve multiple purposes: initially to determine specificity of each assay on a TAC and their LODs, and subsequently to determine any batch variation. For our TAC development, we used a commercial company, GenScript (www.genscript.com), to generate a panel of synthetic control plasmids containing all our target sequences (with 20 nucleotides each side of the primer target sites also included) combined together. These plasmid panels also serve to quality-check each new batch of TAC plates, in a checker board fashion, to ensure all the primers and probes have been spotted correctly into their assigned pods. Extraction and internal controls (MS2, RNase P gene and 18S) can be used to determine sample quality, the reaction failing if any of the control reactions are outside of pre-determined ranges. Specific positioning of the control assays throughout the TAC also enables the user to determine whether sufficient centrifugation has taken place and the mastermix has reached all pods on the TAC.",

This was capable of detecting 21 targets (13 viruses and 8 bacteria) plus control, aimed at diagnosing the cause of acute respiratory infection. Others, including ourselves, have expanded the range of organisms to include those causing atypical pneumonias, a wider range of specific organisms (e.g. influenza A subtypes) and those causing infections in specific patient groups, e.g., those receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy for severe respiratory failure due to a suspected infectious aetiology (see Figure 2 for respiratory/ECMO card layouts). One of the inherent advantages of the TAC development process is the ability to make changes and improvements to individual assays when ordering the next batch of plates (minimum order is 50 plates/400 specimens), which take 6-10 weeks to manufacture. Our current respiratory TAC is now in its eighth version and has dramatically improved during this evolutionary process. Its performance with a commercially available respiratory ZeptoMetrix verification panel (www.zeptometrix.com) compared to Cepheid GeneXpert Flu/RSV test, Biofire FilmArray respiratory panel and our routine multiplex real-time respiratory assays is clearly demonstrated in Table 1 . Moreover, performance with all the available QCMD respiratory pathogen panels (www.qcmd.org) over the last few years has been excellent and is equal to and in most cases now superior to our current routine molecular real-time respiratory assays. Improvements observed in TAC performance during development of the plate have correlated with increased analytical sensitivity of the individual assays and reflect the fact that all assays on the eighth version of the respiratory card can detect down to approximately 3 copies per reaction using our panel of synthetic plasmid controls. A recent comparison with our routine multiplex assays on 417 consecutive respiratory specimen demonstrated the TAC performance (Table 2) , with discrepant results seen only in specimens with very late Ct values (low viral load) and highlighting that the card now outperforms the gold standard test, i.e., more sensitive for RSV and adenovirus.",

While validation of this plate is currently underway in our network of regional laboratories within PHE, the data generated (>500 samples processed) so far are extremely encouraging, and this is clearly illustrated in the performance obtained for the recent Norovirus QCMD (Table 3) and Clostridium difficile QCMD (Table 4 ) panels.",

            "text": "Rachwal and colleagues published a study in which they described an array for the detection of biothreat organisms (Rachwal et al., 2012) . These included Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei. As in the initial paper from Kodani et al. (2011) , these authors pointed out that the array system is around 10-fold less sensitive than singleplex RT-PCR assays performed alongside. This is a factor that has to be borne in mind when considering the clinical application of these assays but since the relevance of very low Ct value results is always a point of contention, this issue is not new to molecular diagnostics. However, as outlined above for our respiratory TAC, striving to improve assays during card development and ensuring only sublime assays (with exquisite analytical sensitivity) migrate to the finalised validated diagnostic card should mitigate and address this point. Additional TACs have been developed within our laboratory. Like the respiratory and Gastro TACs shown in Figure 2 , a jaundice TAC was designed incorporating assays considered important in causing or complicating jaundice in patients. Assays on the jaundice TAC currently include hepatitis viruses A-G, HCV genotyping (1-4), erythrovirus B19, SEN virus (SEN-V), SV40, Dengue virus, pan-adenovirus, polyomaviruses BK and JC, herpes viruses 1-8, Toxoplasma gondii, M. tuberculosis complex, Chlamydophila psittaci and internal controls (Figure 2) . A similar TAC has also been developed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta) but is limited to the hepatitis viruses (Kodani et al., 2014) . Including additional pathogens allows for a more rapid and comprehensive diagnosis without the requirement for multiple blood or biopsy samples to be sought from a patient. It also removes or limits the possibility of missing a complicating infection once an initial diagnosis is made. Another area in which TACs are being applied is in the diagnosis of infections in immunocompromised patients. The number of transplants per year continues to rise, placing increased demands on the clinical care teams and therefore also on diagnostic laboratories. Despite technical innovations, morbidity and mortality rates have not improved in the past 20 years, mainly due to infection, cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Significant advances in early diagnosis of infections will have a beneficial impact on morbidity and mortality rates and therefore will continue to be the focus of current diagnostic algorithm improvements.",

The number of different TACs available continues to expand and their versatility has been explained. As a clinical intervention tool, they offer many possibilities. Locally, the use of TAC assays has provided rapid diagnosis in seriously ill patients requiring ECMO. It has also been instrumental in identifying B19 as the possible causative agent of recurring rhabdomyolysis in a young child, HSV type 1 pneumonia in an immunocompetent patient and a case of BK virus-induced pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient, all of which would have otherwise remained undiagnosed. In addition, the real potential for the use of TAC in outbreak situations has been recognised in its ability to identify M. pneumoniae as the causative agent in an outbreak among university students (Waller et al., 2014) . In that outbreak, the TAC exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity when compared to multiplex realtime PCR and allowed the outbreak to be quickly recognised and appropriately managed. The syndromic approach offers many advantages over a monoplex targeted one. The assays are not without their limitations, and the concommitant loss of sensitivity when using relatively small amounts of nucleic acid extract has to be considered. That aside, the TAC heralds a step forward in the development of versatile molecular assays for diagnosis of infectious disease.",
