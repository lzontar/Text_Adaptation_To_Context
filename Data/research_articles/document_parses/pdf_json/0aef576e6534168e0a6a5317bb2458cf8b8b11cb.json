The sequence flow macro-element is the most articulated one with its 18 elements and 91 occurrences. An interesting group is the one of data object, showing different types of knowledge (17 in total) that can appear in business process model elements, even though their appearance is not as common as the one of the other three groups. The second largest group is activity with its 64 occurrences. Also this group is very diversified including many kinds of \"activities\" and especially the most recurrent element in the meta-models, i.e., activity (27) . Another key area of business processes is the actor /organisational aspect. Indeed, also in the meta-models, we found several occurrences of organisational-related elements (72). We also surprisingly found that other groups of elements appearing in existing business definitions, as for instance goal and value, do not occur in the meta-models. In particular goal is considered as central in one of the more recent business process definition proposed by Weske in [30] , however the element goal appears only few times in the meta-models. Yet, also some time-related elements are not very represented. For instance only five elements are considered in the macroelement state and also the element state itself appears in only 4 meta-models. We also observed that five elements are considered as members of more than one group, such as information, position, role, application, and process participant. In this sense, the macro-element resource is the most interconnected having elements in common with the group actor and data object. This aspect is mainly due to the fact that some elements could play several roles in a business process (model). For instance information could be conceived as a resource but also as a data object.

In fact, only few authors did include explicit semantics, while for most of the cases it was either lacking or provided in terms of commonsense descriptions.

Also some of the organisational and data elements, such as actor, resource and artifact, are quite well investigated although their semantics and relations are still quite unclear.

The relations between elements across different categories are also rather limited, thus leaving the behavioural, the data/organisational and the goal components poorly connected the one to the other.

By looking at the LB meta-model and at its taxonomy, however, we can clearly notice that the goal element, besides being under-investigated in the literature, is also scarcely connected. This can be due to the lack of a graphical element for representing goals in most of the business process modelling graphical notations.

The EPC-event is intended instead as \"describing preconditions and postconditions of functions\" [19] , that is, in terms of state. This overloading of the same label for different semantics, as well as the lack of a clear relation between event-EPC and precondition reveals an imprecise and non-agreed understanding of these concepts and of their relations within the community. This criticality is further confirmed when looking at the relations between the two notions of event and activity. While the causality essence of the initiated by relation between activity and event-BPMN reflects the active nature of the event-BPMN, the predecessor and successor relations between activity and event-EPC confirms their temporal characterisation, the activates relation between activity and event-EPC is tricky.

As already noted in Sect. 4, the different metamodels analysed associate, at type (i.e., conceptual) level, two different semantics to the term \"event\", which we resolved by explicitly renaming this element into event-BPMN and event-EPC. This overloading would become even more complex if we would take into account also the token (i.e., execution) level (mentioned for instance in [27] ), where the term event is used to denote specific executions of activities and is close to the meaning of event as used in an \"event log\". This semantic overloading is somehow not a surprise for the BPM community, where the term \"event\" is used to denote elements that can pertain the type level, the token level, something that happens in time, a trigger that has causal power, and pre-postconditions. 5 In this paper we concentrate our analysis mainly on the way \"event\" is used, in the different meta-models at type level. Nonetheless, it is easy to notice that, from an ontological point of view, events are often understood as elements happening at token level, that is, specific occurrences in time (see e.g., [8] ). Then, what are event-BPMN and event-EPC? By looking at the language specification of BPMN, event-BPMN can be explained in terms of \"a pattern of behaviour\", that is, an activity type, which is an abstract entity [8] . 6 Indeed event-BPMN, similarly to activities in that language, can be realised at token level by event occurrences (they happen in time), and can be repeated again and again in several process executions. What seems to differentiate the two notions in BPMN is more the fact that events \"happen\" in the world while activities denote pieces of works that a company (or a process owner more in general) should perform. Our proposal, therefore, is to borrow some concepts from the domain of statistics and conceive them as a sort of exogenous activity type, in contrast to the activities that happen within the process owner boundaries, that we rename endogenous activity type. This is a first analysis that may be further refined as these boundaries in BPMN are not always clear and events in BPMN are used to denote both elements with an \"active\" flavour (e.g., sending a message) as well as elements with a more \"passive\" flavour (e.g., exceptions or timers), whose differences should be accounted for. Nonetheless, we consider event-BPMN as an activity type as all these elements would be considered as \"a pattern of behaviour\" at type level according to [8] and not elements happening at token level.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 823, "end": 824, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1139, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1358, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1362, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2516, "end": 2519, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Towards an Ontologically Grounded Meta-model Refinement"}, {"text": "If we move to ARIS EPCs, the analysis is slightly more complex. On the one hand, event-EPC is used as pre-postconditions which seem to be conceived as states. On the other hand, event-EPC is also described as an activator of activities. These two views are, from an ontological point of view, incompatible, as states cannot have causal power characteristics. Indeed, although states can be involved in causal relations, they cannot cause anything per-se [9] . Consider in a loan application process, \"To have the credit history\" is a state which acts as precondition for the \"assess eligibility\" activity, but that precondition alone cannot cause the assessment of eligibility. In this respect, the relation precondition enables activity found in the LB meta-model 7 appears to be more adequate than the one of event-EPC activates activity. Inspired by the analyses in [3] and [9] , in this paper we propose to solve this inconsistency by viewing event-EPC as a specific pre-postcondition, and thus removing it, together with the activates relation from the diagram. Nonetheless, we strongly believe that this causal notion involving activities should be further investigated. Indeed, this double view of the notion of event-EPC, together with the higher presence of the notion of precondition w.r.t. the one of postcondition in the analysed metamodels, seem to suggest a need to incorporate some notion of \"trigger\" (distinct from a notion of state) that can explain (cause) the activation of activities within a business process. Instead, when discussing causal relations we can note that, although activities cannot cause directly anything (e.g., create) at type level, they have a sort of causal power, as they can explain why a certain activity type can cause something else, such as a state or other activities. Figure 2 summarises the refactoring of the two notions of event-BPMN and event-EPC explained above. Filled boxes represent newly added entities, and boldface has been used to denote newly added relations.
