These applications typically comprise a set of sensors that are installed in open fields and measure metrics, such as temperature or humidity, which are used for irrigation control systems. Though useful, most contemporary systems have high installation and maintenance costs, and they do not offer automated control or, if they do, they are usually not interpretable, and thus cannot be trusted for such critical applications. In this work, we design Vital, a system that incorporates a set of low-cost sensors, a robust data store, and most importantly an explainable AI decision support system. Our system outputs a fuzzy rule-base, which is interpretable and allows fully automating the irrigation of the fields. Upon evaluating Vital in two pilot cases, we conclude that it can be effective for monitoring open-field installations.",

The first two nodes send data to a base station and the user can manually activate the valve connected to the third node to irrigate the field. A similar system was proposed in [21] , which also monitors these metrics and further integrates a solar-power node to reduce the energy needs of the system. Project SWAMP [12] takes water control one step further, by integrating not only water consumption but also water reserve and distribution metrics. All of these systems, however, are not automated, so an expert agronomist has to continuously monitor them and take any decisions concerning irrigation.",

A similar algorithm based on sensor and weather data is proposed in [16] . Though useful, these approaches still require expert monitoring. A more advanced method is proposed in [11] , employing Support Vector Regression to predict soil moisture for a range of upcoming days, which is then used to determine whether and when irrigation should start.

The involvement of fuzzy logic is justified by the following: i) expert knowledge is fuzzy and not precise and can thus be easier integrated, ii) data from sensors in the real world are noisy and are reported with a degree of fuzziness, iii) fuzzy consequents enable a smoother output response than traditional crisp systems [3, 9] . One of the first approaches [10] includes a fuzzy logic model that receives as input soil humidity values from a sensor and determines the irrigation duration using four linguistic variables: zero, short-term, middle-term, and large-time. A more complex model is proposed in [29] , which is based on temperature (low, moderate, high), soil moisture (dry, moderate, wet), and humidity (less, medium, high) and results in a set of rules capable of determining pump operation and its duration. In [17] five triangular membership functions are used as input corresponding to sunlight intensity, wind speed, humidity, temperature, and soil moisture, while the output indicates the necessary irrigation quantity. Similarly, the model proposed in [15] uses Gaussian membership functions and receives input from ten sensors, two air sensors (for humidity and temperature) and eight ground moisture sensors placed in different parts of the area, to provide more accurate recommendations.",

These systems have displayed their superiority to classical decision trees and crisp rule-based systems and their robustness in different AI applications including classification [2, 6, 25] , big data analysis [6, 27] , and regression [19, 26] . FRBSs allow for the definition of simple and verbally formulated rules over imprecise domains which can be combined to generate precise yet understandable results. They are an extension to classical rule-based systems, since they involve \"IF-THEN\" type of rules, but the antecedents and consequents comprising each rule are composed of fuzzy logic statements, instead of classical ones. The use of fuzzy sets with linguistic labels is particularly noteworthy, as the output system has a significant interpretability degree for the expert to understand the reasoning mechanisms of the model and the inner details of the problem characteristics. These types of systems are called Mamdani-type FRBSs [5] and have two main components (illustrated in Fig. 3) : i) the fuzzy inference system, which implements the fuzzy reasoning process to be applied on the input to infer the output, and ii) the fuzzy knowledge base (KB), representing the knowledge about the problem being solved. The KB contains the fuzzy rules composed of linguistic variables that take values from a descriptive term set with a real-world meaning. This distinction between the fuzzy rule structures and their meaning allows us to define two different sub-components, namely the fuzzy rule base (RB) containing the collection of fuzzy rules, and the data base (DB) containing the membership functions of the fuzzy partitions associated to the linguistic variables. The Mamdani-type FRBS structure demonstrates several features that are of particular importance for the application presented herein: i) firstly, it provides a natural framework to include expert knowledge in the form of linguistic fuzzy rules; ii) secondly, the fuzzy inference mechanism makes full use of the power of fuzzy logic-based reasoning; and iii) thirdly, it composes a highly flexible means to formulate knowledge, while at the same time it remains interpretable.",

Both soil moisture content and ETo were potential inputs and could be taken into account by the FRBS in order to infer the best time to irrigate as well as the amount of irrigation necessary.",

            "text": "In the two plots controlled by the FRBS two independent courses of actions were followed. In both cases, the fuzzy KB was preselected by an expert (i.e. an agronomist) using the linguistic description of the input variables. This was done to demonstrate the ability of fuzzy systems to incorporate the expert knowledge in a straightforward way, enabling people not familiar with machine learning models to effortlessly develop an AI-based model. In one of these two plots however, the rule base was allowed to evolve to automatically tune the components of the fuzzy KB. This was deemed important as the irrigation mode of operation represents an open-loop type of control, where a decision to irrigate is sent to the gateway and thence to the relevant slave device and valve, without immediate feedback-feedback is received once the gateway synchronizes its data with the IoT platform at its predetermined time interval. The FRBS can then use this input-output relationship from prior actions and improve its structure and components by tweaking the necessary parameters, in accordance to the delayed feedback it receives, so that it can improve in the future. Additionally, and because the system automatically redefines its components to address the needs, the rule base can accordingly be more robust to perturbations and changes (e.g. in ambient conditions). Hence, this smart AI-driven system can be more precise in the management of irrigation and thus ipso facto help conserve water and resources. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5 for the month of January (which was dry and had the most irrigation needs). The crop needs are the calculated ETo minus the precipitation; the FRBS-auto is the closest to the theoretical values with an RMSE of 0.63 mm, compared to 2.10 mm for FRBS-expert and 6.47 mm for control, which was the most wasteful of all.

Furthermore, we design a fuzzy-rule based system that effectively takes decisions about the irrigation of the fields. Compared to other open-field agriculture systems, our system encompasses an eXplainable AI approach, thus ensuring maximum efficiency as well as increased interpretability, by enabling humans to inspect the model, which is highly desirable in such critical applications.",
