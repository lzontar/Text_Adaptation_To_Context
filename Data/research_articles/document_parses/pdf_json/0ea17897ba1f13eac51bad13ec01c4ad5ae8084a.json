In other cases, stroke signs could be misdiagnosed in patients with COVID-19 severe respiratory problems or because protection measures and distancing limited or even prevented neurological consultations. Although these two reports are related to restricted geographical areas of Europe, these observations introduce a warning message on the negative impact that COVID-19 had on quality of pre-hospital and in-hospital stroke care and hint at possible long-term consequences in terms of increased disability burden. Because stroke is the second cause of mortality and the first of disability in Western countries, the best stroke care should be ensured, also in any challenging time, in order to not vanish the excellent results achieved over the last years in improving stroke outcome (5, 8) .",

            "text": "In this European Journal of Neurology issue, two papers report on stroke care changes during COVID-19 outbreak. In the first Tejada Meza et al. (3) show COVID-19 impact in Aragon region, Spain. Data concerning 275 and 79 patients, admitted respectively before and during the COVID-19 period, showed a significant drop in the number of hospital admissions for stroke and in the rate (8.5 vs. 4 per week) of reperfusion therapies (intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy). The second paper from Pop et al. (4) reported an analysis of the change of acute stroke pathways parameters between March 2019 and March 2020 in three stroke units of Alsace, France. A reduction of 39.5% in stroke alerts (174 in 2020 vs. 288 in 2019) and 33.3% in acute revascularization therapies was observed. No delay in the onset-to-needle time was reported in either study and no clinical and demographic difference between patients admitted in the pre-and post-COVID era were shown. The two papers highlight the importance of alert activation measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.",
