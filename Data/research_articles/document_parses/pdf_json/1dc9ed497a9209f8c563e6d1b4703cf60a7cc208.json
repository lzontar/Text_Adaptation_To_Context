            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is widely used to investigate host-virus interactions. Cellular responses to HCV infection have been extensively studied in vitro. However, in human liver, interferon (IFN)stimulated gene expression can mask direct transcriptional responses to infection. To better characterize the direct effects of HCV infection in vivo, we analyze the transcriptomes of HCVinfected patients lacking an activated endogenous IFN system. We show that expression changes observed in these patients predominantly reflect immune cell infiltrates rather than cell-intrinsic pathways. We also investigate the transcriptomes of patients with endogenous IFN activation, which paradoxically cannot eradicate viral infection. We find that most IFN-stimulated genes are induced by both recombinant IFN therapy and the endogenous IFN system, but with lower induction levels in the latter, indicating that the innate immune response in chronic hepatitis C is too weak to clear the virus. We show that coding and non-coding transcripts have different expression dynamics following IFN treatment. Several microRNA primary transcripts, including that of miR-122, are significantly down-regulated in response to IFN treatment, suggesting a new mechanism for IFN-induced expression fine-tuning.",

An estimated 160 million persons are chronically infected worldwide and are at risk to develop liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Lavanchy, 2011) . Because of their substantial impact on human health, HCV infections have been extensively studied. HCV is now one of the most widely used model systems to investigate host-virus interactions (Colpitts et al, 2015) . HCV is transmitted through blood and infects and replicates in hepatocytes. Due to the lack of a small animal model and of the difficulties inherent to working with human samples, HCV-host cell interactions have been mainly studied in a cell culture system, specifically in Huh7-derived hepatoma cells infected with the JFH1 isolate of the virus (Lindenbach et al, 2005; Wakita et al, 2005; Zhong et al, 2005; Walters et al, 2009; Colpitts et al, 2015) . Experiments in this in vitro system have identified a large number of host factors that are required for viral replication or that have antiviral properties (Colpitts et al, 2015) . This experimental system also brought important insights into the virus-host interactions that may contribute to pathogenesis, for example, revealing cell cycle perturbations in HCV-infected cells (Walters et al, 2009) . However, few of these findings have been evaluated in the human liver.",

            "text": "Studying HCV infections in vivo presents important challenges. An intrinsic difficulty comes from the immune response, which is a strong confounding factor in analyses of human liver biopsies. Gene expression differences between HCV-infected and uninfected livers are the result of direct HCV-induced cell-autonomous adaptive responses in infected cells and of more global changes that result from the immune response in the liver. The chronic phase of HCV infections is characterized by a largely ineffective cellular immune response combined with a highly variable interferon-lambdamediated innate immune response (Heim & Thimme, 2014) . A significant proportion of patients are characterized by an endogenous activation of the interferon (IFN) system, in which hundreds of classical IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are strongly induced (Heim & Thimme, 2014) . The presence of the endogenous IFN system activation can mask more subtle changes that occur as a direct consequence of viral infection and replication in HCV-infected cells. The confounding effect of the immune answer is aggravated by the fact that the percentage of HCV-infected hepatocytes rarely exceeds 50% and often is below 20%, whereas ISG expression can be observed in up to 95% of cells (Wieland et al, 2014) . To better understand the molecular consequences of HCV infection in vivo, it is thus important to disentangle the direct cellular response to viral infections from the transcriptional signature of the immune response, and in particular of the endogenous IFN system activation.",

            "text": "The endogenous activity of the IFN system is also highly relevant for therapeutic choice in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Until the recent introduction of direct antiviral drugs for the treatment of CHC, recombinant pegylated IFN-alpha 2 (pegIFN-a) had been an essential component of the standard of care for CHC for over 25 years, and it is still used in many parts of the world. Treatment with pegIFN-a and ribavirin achieved cure rates between 30 and 80%, depending on the viral genotype, pre-treatment patient history, and stage of liver fibrosis (Heim, 2013) . The success of the treatment is also highly dependent on the genetic background of the patients. Genome-wide association studies revealed significant associations between polymorphisms in the IFNL4 gene and response to pegIFN-a/ribavirin (Bibert et al, 2013; Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013; Terczynska-Dyla et al, 2014) . The recently discovered IFNL4 protein has strong antiviral properties and stimulates ISG production through binding to the IFN-lambda receptor (Hamming et al, 2013; Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013) . The IFNL4 gene harbors several genetic variants in human populations, including a frameshift mutation that abrogates the production of the IFNL4 protein (Terczynska-Dyla et al, 2014) . Paradoxically, the IFNL4-producing genotype is associated with poor response to pegIFN-a/ribavirin, whereas mutated alleles coding for an IFNL4 variant with strongly reduced biological activity or even a complete loss of function are associated with very good spontaneous and treatment-induced resolution rates (Terczynska-Dyla et al, 2014) . These observations are consistent with earlier findings that patients who have a strong endogenous induction of ISGs during the chronic phase of HCV infection do not respond to therapeutically injected pegIFN-a (Chen et al, 2005; Asselah et al, 2008; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al, 2008) . It is presently not known why the activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver in patients with the IFNL4-producing genotype is ineffective against HCV, whereas pegIFN-a-induced ISG expression results in viral eradication in so many patients.",

With this objective, we generated and analyzed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing profiles from liver biopsies derived from different categories of HCV-infected and non-infected patients, prior to and during treatment. First, to unveil HCV-induced cell-autonomous effects and to separate them from IFN-induced changes in the transcriptome, we selected liver biopsies from CHC patients without hepatic ISG induction, and compared them with uninfected control biopsies. Second, we examined the transcriptomic changes associated with the endogenous activation of the IFN system in a subset of CHC patients. Finally, we analyzed the gene expression changes resulting from pegIFN-a/ribavirin treatment, by comparing transcriptome data from liver biopsies obtained before treatment and at different time points during the first week of therapy. We found that the transcriptional profiles associated with endogenous IFN activation and with pegIFN-a/ribavirin treatment share a core set of IFN-stimulated genes, although quantitative differences can be found in gene activation levels.",

Interestingly, we found that the primary transcripts of several miRNAs [including miR-122, which is required for HCV replication (Jopling et al, 2005) ] are down-regulated following pegIFN-a treatment in the human liver. Consistently, we observe a subtle up-regulation of the corresponding miRNA target genes, indicating that the expression changes observed for the precursor transcripts are reflected in the mature miRNA levels.

The first group, characterized by overall low-ISG transcript levels, comprised 21 samples, including all six non-CHC liver biopsies and 15 of the CHC samples. Importantly, no clear distinction was found between the non-CHC and the CHC samples in this group. The second group, consisting of seven CHC samples, displayed higher expression levels across the 20 analyzed ISGs (Fig 1A) . Importantly, we note that this separation between two groups of patients cannot be explained by the HCV genotype carried by the CHC patients, as all four genotypes were found in the seven patients with high-ISG levels ( Fig 1A) . Similarly, analysis of the inflammation and fibrosis METAVIR scores (Bedossa & Poynard, 1996) and of the HCV viral load indicated that these factors cannot explain the patient grouping (Fig 1A and B ). To verify that the clustering of CHC samples was not dependent on the set of genes used as markers, we performed a principal component analysis on 360 genes associated with Gene Ontology (GO) categories related to response to interferon (Materials and Methods). This analysis confirmed that our sample sub-classification is robust with respect to the choice of the ISG input dataset (Appendix Fig S1) .",

The height of the rectangles represents the percentage of genes that reaches maximum expression in each of the tissues. D Boxplots of the intensity of the expression change (log2-fold) between non-CHC patients and CHC low-ISG patients, for different categories of protein-coding genes defined based on the miRNAs that are predicted to target them. Only miRNAs with high expression in normal or HCV-infected liver were analyzed (Hou et al, 2011) . Evolutionarily conserved miRNA target predictions were extracted from TargetScan v7.1 (Agarwal et al, 2015; Materials and Methods) . From left to right: genes that are not conserved targets of any expressed miRNA; genes that are targeted by at least one expressed miRNA; genes that are targeted by miR-122-5p, miR-192/215, let7a-i/miR-98, and miR-199a/199b, respectively. Horizontal bars represent median values. Boxes represent the inter-quartile (25-75%) ranges of the distribution. Boxplot whiskers extend to the most extreme data point found within 1.5 times the inter-quartile distance from the box. Outlier points are not shown. . We found that miR-122 targets had significantly higher fold changes (median 0.045) than targets of other expressed miRNAs (median \u00c00.025, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P-value 1e-3) and than genes not targeted by this set of liver miRNAs (median \u00c00.15, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P-value < 1e-10; Fig 2D) . These observations are compatible with the reported subtle de-repression of miR-122 target genes in the presence of HCV infection (Luna et al, 2015) . However, we also found that miR-122 targets have comparable expression fold changes with the targets of other highly expressed miRNAs, such as miR-192, let-7, or miR-199 ( Fig 2D) . Similar conclusions were reached when analyzing a set of miRNA targets identified in Huh7 cells using highthroughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (Luna et al, 2015; Appendix Fig S2B, Dataset EV4) . Overall, the fold expression change was positively correlated with the number of distinct miRNA families that are predicted to target each gene (Appendix Fig S2C) . This observation cannot be simply explained by the previously reported sequestration of miR-122 by HCV, but may reflect the expression or functional characteristics of genes targeted by multiple miRNA families. Our results thus reveal a potential confounding factor in the up-regulation of miR-122 targets following HCV infection.",

To do this, we contrasted gene expression levels between non-CHC and CHC high-ISG samples (Materials and Methods). Using the same parameters as above, we observed numerous differentially expressed genes in the high-ISG patients, including 503 protein-coding genes, 80 candidate long non-coding RNAs, and 125 other genes ( Fig 3A, Dataset EV2 ). The observed expression fold changes and significance levels spanned a wider range than for the comparison between non-CHC and CHC low-ISG patients (Figs 2A and 3A) . As expected, the most highly up-regulated protein-coding genes were known ISGs, including LAMP3, IFI27, and RSAD2 ( Fig 3B) . The up-regulated long non-coding RNAs included a previously described interferon-inducible transcript, NRIR (Kambara et al, 2014; Fig 3C) . Gene ontology analyses showed a strong enrichment for genes involved in immune system processes, in particular response to virus and type I interferon signaling pathway (Dataset EV3). Interestingly, the GO categories found to be enriched among the genes up-regulated in CHC low-ISG patients were generally also over-represented in this second comparison, although the enrichment was much weaker than the one observed for the interferon pathway (Dataset EV3). In agreement with these observations, we found that interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) motifs and IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) motifs were strongly overrepresented in the promoters of the genes up-regulated in CHC high-ISG samples (Appendix Fig S3) . However, we also observed a significant enrichment for NFKB and ERG motifs (Appendix Fig  S3) , indicating the presence of immune cells in these high-ISG samples. The promoters of down-regulated genes were enriched in binding sites for two liver-specific transcription factors, HNF4a and HNF1, indicating that most down-regulated genes are hepatocyte-specific genes (Appendix Fig S3) . As in the comparison between non-CHC and CHC low-ISG samples (see above), we found no evidence for a specific de-repression of miR-122 target genes ( Fig 3D) .",

The remaining genes that were only differentially expressed in low ISG compared to non-CHC patients generally displayed consistent fold changes in both comparisons, but did not pass the FDR threshold when comparing CHC high-ISG and non-CHC samples (Fig 4B-D) . In contrast, most of the genes that were uniquely up-regulated or down-regulated in CHC high-ISG patients compared to controls had only weak expression changes in the comparison between CHC low-ISG and control samples (Fig 4B, E and F) . These observations are consistent with the presence of a unique expression signature associated with the group of high-ISG patients ( Fig 1A) . To further define this expression signature, we directly compared the two groups of CHC samples (Appendix Fig S4, Dataset EV2). We found numerous genes with significant expression changes, including 176 proteincoding genes and 21 lncRNA candidates (Appendix Fig S4) . As expected, we observed a strong enrichment for biological processes associated with defense response to virus and type I interferon signaling pathway among the genes up-regulated in high ISG (Dataset EV3).",

A previous genome-wide analysis of differential gene expression in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells revealed that numerous genes involved in cell death, cell cycle, and cell growth/proliferation are mis-regulated following viral infection (Walters et al, 2009 ). Although our unsupervised gene ontology analyses did not reveal enrichments for cell cycle-associated categories among the genes differentially expressed in CHC samples (Dataset EV3), we found significant intersections between the sets of genes that are differentially expressed following HCV infection in vivo and in vitro. Specifically, out of 698 protein-coding genes differentially regulated in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells (Materials and Methods), we found that 25 (3.6%) were differentially expressed between control and CHC low-ISG samples and 48 (6.9%) were differentially expressed between control and CHC high-ISG samples (FDR < 0.1, Dataset EV5). The extent of the overlap was significantly higher than expected by chance given the total number of differentially expressed genes, in both cases (chi-square test, P-value < 1e-9). The common differentially regulated genes included several genes associated with cell death and cell cycle, such as UBD, TNFRSF9, BIRC3, JUN, and FOS (Dataset EV5). Differentially expressed genes shared between HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells and high-ISG liver biopsies include classical ISGs, such as MX1, ISG15, and IFIT1 (Dataset EV5), as expected given the previously reported A Volcano plot for the differential expression analysis between non-CHC patients and CHC patients with high levels of endogenous ISG activation (CHC high ISG). The x-axis represents the log2-fold expression change in CHC high-ISG compared to non-CHC patients. The y-axis represents the false discovery rate (with a \u00c0log10 transformation) of the differential expression test. Protein-coding genes, candidate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and other gene categories (including pseudogenes and transcripts with unclear coding potential; Materials and Methods) are represented separately. Only genes with false discovery rate (FDR) < 10% and with fold expression change > 1.5 are shown. B Heatmap of the expression patterns of the top differentially expressed genes between non-CHC and CHC high-ISG patients. To select the top differentially expressed genes, we set a fold change threshold of 5 for up-regulated genes and of 1/3 for down-regulated genes. The heatmap represents the Z-score of the log2-transformed RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) gene expression levels, normalized based on housekeeping genes (Materials and Methods). C Example of a lncRNA (NRIR; Kambara et al, 2014) significantly up-regulated in high-ISG patients. The boxplots represent the distribution of expression levels (log2-transformed RPKM) for the three categories of samples. Each point represents an individual sample. Horizontal bars represent median values. Boxes represent the inter-quartile (25-75%) ranges of the distribution. Boxplot whiskers extend to the most extreme data point found within 1.5 times the inter-quartile distance from the box. D Boxplots of the intensity of the expression change (log2-fold) between non-CHC patients and CHC high-ISG patients, for different categories of protein-coding genes defined based on the miRNAs that are predicted to target them. Only miRNAs with high expression in normal or HCV-infected liver were analyzed (Hou et al, 2011) . Evolutionarily conserved miRNA target predictions were extracted from TargetScan v7.1 (Agarwal et al, 2015; Materials and Methods) . From left to right: genes that are not conserved targets of any expressed miRNA; genes that are targeted by at least one expressed miRNA; genes that are targeted by miR-122-5p, miR-192/215, let7a-i/miR-98, and miR-199a/199b, respectively. Horizontal bars represent median values. Boxes represent the inter-quartile (25-75%) ranges of the distribution. Boxplot whiskers extend to the most extreme data point found within 1.5 times the inter-quartile distance from the box. Outlier points are not shown. ",

Strikingly, for all gene categories the vast majority of down-regulated genes were observed 16 h after treatment, with only few detected cases elsewhere (Fig 5A) . At all time points, we found strong enrichments in GO categories related to the type I interferon signaling and response to virus pathways among the genes that were up-regulated following pegIFN-a treatment (Dataset EV7), as expected. Consistently, we observed that interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) motifs and IFNregulatory factor (IRF) motifs were strongly enriched in the promoters of up-regulated protein-coding genes, at all time points (Appendix Fig S5A-E) . For down-regulated genes, we found significant (FDR < 0.1) enrichments in functional categories related to small-molecule biosynthetic process and lipid metabolism, but only for the 16-h time point (Dataset EV7).",

For up-regulated lncRNAs and other non-coding genes, the time point-specificity was even stronger (Fig 5B) . However, we were able to identify a core set of 59 genes that are up-regulated at four or more time points, including 30 genes up-regulated at all analyzed time points (Dataset EV8). Interestingly, three lncRNAs were found to be significantly up-regulated at all time points (Dataset EV8, Appendix Fig  S5F-H) . However, two of these lncRNAs [including NRIR, a lncRNA previously proposed to act as a negative regulator of interferon response (Kambara et al, 2014) ] are found downstream of interferon-stimulated protein-coding genes (CMPK2 and BST2), and our RNA-seq data suggest that their induction may be at least in part due to leaky transcription from the upstream gene (Appendix Fig  S5F and G) . No such neighborhood effects were observed for the third lncRNA, which is found upstream of RHOT1 (Appendix Fig  S5H) .

            "text": "The endogenous induction of hundreds of ISGs in patients with CHC has little impact on viral replication, whereas treatment of patients with recombinant pegIFN-a achieves high cure rates specifically in patients without an activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver (Heim, 2013; Heim & Thimme, 2014) . To investigate the molecular differences between these two modes of IFN system activation, we compared the transcriptional response to pegIFN-a treatment with the one elicited by the endogenous IFN system activation. We first extracted the genes that are significantly up-or down-regulated following pegIFN-a treatment, at each time point, and analyzed their expression differences between CHC low-ISG and CHC high-ISG patients (Fig 6, Dataset EV9 ). We found that the vast majority of genes that are up-regulated upon pegIFN-a treatment are also induced in high-ISG patients (Fig 6,  Dataset EV9 ). In numerous cases, these differences were also statistically significant (FDR < 10%) in the comparison between low-ISG and high-ISG patients (Fig 6) . However, the level of gene induction was significantly stronger in the pegIFN-a treatment analysis (Fig 6A) , as were the absolute levels of gene expression in the corresponding samples ( Fig 6C) . In other words, the ISG expression levels reached after pegIFN-a/ribavirin treatment are higher than the ones observed in patients with high endogenous ISG levels. In contrast, genes that were down-regulated upon pegIFN-a treatment were only rarely down-regulated in high ISG compared to low-ISG patients (Fig 6B and D) . Similar conclusions were reached when extracting genes that are significantly differentially expressed between low-ISG and high-ISG patients and analyzing their expression patterns following pegIFN-a treatment (Appendix Fig S6) . We analyzed the global similarity in expression patterns between high-ISG samples and post-treatment samples, using a principal component analysis and a hierarchical clustering analysis applied to pegIFN-a-affected genes (Appendix Fig S7) . Both clustering methods indicated that high-ISG samples are globally similar in expression patterns to the later time points in the pegIFN-a treatment (48, 96 and 144 h). Taken together, these observations suggest that the endogenous IFN system activation and its external stimulation with pegIFN-a/ribavirin treatment have qualitatively similar effects on the gene expression patterns on the human liver transcriptomes. However, numerous quantitative differences in the two transcriptional responses can be observed, with stronger ISG induction levels following pegIFN-a/ ribavirin treatment.",

We analyzed the expression of these genes in our samples (Fig 7, Dataset EV10) . We found that their expression levels in pegIFN-a/ribavirin-treated samples and in high-ISG samples were strongly positively correlated (Fig 7A) . However, a number of these candidate ISGs were indeed significantly more stimulated by pegIFN-a than by endogenous IFNs in high-ISG patients (Fig 7A, Dataset EV10 ). In particular, six genes (IRF1, IRF2, IRF7, IRF9, OASL, IFITM3) that were reported as antiviral effectors in at least two publications (Schoggins et al, 2011; Metz et al, 2013) did not differ significantly between low-ISG and high-ISG samples. However, with the exception of IRF2, all of them appeared to be induced in high-ISG patients compared to controls or low-ISG patients, albeit at weak levels. Thus, we could not identify ISGs that are exclusively induced by pegIFN-a and that could be bona fide anti-HCV effector genes.",

Note that no genes displayed statistically significant opposite patterns (e.g., up-regulated by pegIFN-a treatment, but down-regulated in high ISG compared to low-ISG samples). This dataset included some genes with known antiviral functions, such as APOBEC3A and OASL, which is potentially relevant for the inability of patients with high endogenous ISG levels to spontaneously clear the viral infection. Overall, a tendency for up-regulation or down-regulation for these genes was also observed in high-ISG samples compared to low-ISG samples, but at lower levels and with more variability among individuals (Appendix Fig S8) .",

In total, 11 miRNA host genes were significantly differentially expressed (FDR < 0.05) for at least one time point, and all instances were down-regulated rather than up-regulated ( Fig 8A) . Strikingly, these down-regulated precursors include the \"host\" gene of miR-122, which enhances HCV replication in human hepatocytes (Jopling et al, 2006 ; Fig 8A and B) . The estimated decrease in expression levels is likely not due to differential processing of the mature miRNA out of the primary transcript, as consistent differences between baseline and post-treatment biopsies were observed along the entire gene length (Fig 8B, Appendix Fig S9) . Among the other miRNAs whose precursor genes are down-regulated upon pegIFN-a treatment, miR-146a is a striking example, with significant down-regulation (at 10% FDR) for three out of the five analyzed time points (Fig 8A) .",

C Dot-chart of the median fold expression change following pegIFN-a/ribavirin treatment at the 16-h time point, for predicted targets of miRNAs whose hosts are down-regulated (red dots) or of other miRNAs (black dots). We show 79 miRNA families with at least 100 conserved target genes. As a control, we show the median fold expression change for all genes predicted to be targets of any liver-expressed miRNAs or of genes not predicted to be targeted by these miRNAs (blue dots). The horizontal bars represent 95% confidence intervals of the median, constructed with a bootstrap resampling approach (Materials and Methods). Only miRNAs with high expression in normal or HCV-infected liver were analyzed (Hou et al, 2011) . genes, the three highest median expression fold changes at the 16-h time point were found for miRNAs whose precursor genes were down-regulated following treatment: miR-122, miR-331, and miR-146a/b (Fig 8C) . High median fold changes were also observed for miR-22, as well as for miR-24, miR-214, and miR-192 to a lower extent (Fig 8C) . We note that this pattern is specific to the 16-h time point; that is, the miRNAs whose primary transcripts are downregulated do not stand out from the bulk of liver-expressed miRNAs at other time points (Appendix Figs S11 and S12). This result is consistent with our analysis of the temporal dynamics of interferoninduced gene expression, as the strongest changes following pegIFN-a treatment were also observed at the 16-h time point, for most gene categories (Fig 5) .",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most widely used model systems to investigate host-virus interactions. The adaptive changes to HCV infections have been studied extensively in cell culture systems. For example, a comprehensive analysis of gene expression in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells reported over 800 genes with > 2-fold changes in expression (Walters et al, 2009 ). Adaptive changes were described in lipid biosynthetic pathways, endoplasmatic reticulum stress response, autophagy, and cell cycle regulation. However, due to the difficulties inherent to human liver tissue sampling, few of these findings have been validated in vivo. To investigate whether the observations obtained in cell culture systems can be confirmed in the human liver, we have collected and analyzed transcriptome data from liver biopsies derived from control and chronic hepatitis C patients, in the absence of and during treatment with pegIFN-a/ribavirin. In the liver, cell-intrinsic adaptive changes to HCV infections are difficult to distinguish from changes induced by the immune response. In experimentally infected chimpanzees, transcriptome analysis revealed a strong induction of hundreds of ISGs in all animals (Bigger et al, 2004) . Due to a genetic polymorphism in the IFNL4 gene, ISG induction in humans is variable (Prokunina-Olsson et al, 2013; Terczynska-Dyla et al, 2014) . In this study, in order to reduce the strong confounding influence of the endogenous IFN system, we analyzed gene expression patterns separately for patients with or without endogenous IFN activation. We found that gene expression changes between uninfected liver samples and low-ISG samples mainly reflect the presence of immune cell infiltrates in the latter group. However, even in biopsies from patients without ISG induction (low-ISG patients) we could not detect expression changes of genes involved in cellular responses to HCV described in cell culture. For example, a previous large-scale analysis of differential gene expression in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells revealed that numerous genes involved in cell death, cell cycle, and cell growth/ proliferation are mis-regulated following viral infection (Walters et al, 2009 ), while our differential expression analyses did not reveal enrichments for these functional categories of genes. We therefore used a targeted approach and specifically analyzed genes previously reported to be changed in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells (Walters et al, 2009 ). Specifically, we could identify a core set of 25 genes that are differentially expressed following HCV infection both in Huh-7.5 cells and in liver samples from patients without IFN system activation. This common gene set included several cell cycle-associated genes, such as UBD, ITIH1, and BIRC3 (Dataset EV5; Walters et al, 2009 ). Thus, we were able to identify a significant number of genes that respond to HCV infection both in vivo and in vitro.",

It has been estimated that the number of HCV virions per infected cell is between 1 and 8 in the human liver, but can be as high as 500-1,000 in the Huh-7.5 cell culture model (Stiffler et al, 2009) . It is thus conceivable that some of changes described in cell culture are due to the high viral concentration and do not occur in vivo. However, it is also possible that our analysis was underpowered to detect HCV-induced cell-intrinsic changes in gene expression. Changes in infected hepatocytes could be masked by unchanged gene expression in non-infected hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells (endothelial cells, biliary epithelial cells, stellate cells, fibroblasts, and Kupffer cells). Nonparenchymal cells provide about one-third of the liver mass, and the number of infected hepatocytes can vary from 1 to 55% (Wieland et al, 2014) . To minimize the information dilution from uninfected cells, we preferentially included in our study samples from patients with high viral load, because the proportion of infected cells significantly correlates with serum viral load (Wieland et al, 2014) . Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that because of these limitations we could not detect some genuine HCV-induced cell-intrinsic changes of gene expression.",

            "text": "We also addressed a long-standing conundrum in the field regarding the inability of the endogenous IFN system activation to eradicate HCV infections. Ever since the discovery that a substantial proportion of patients with CHC have a strong induction of hundreds of ISGs in the liver (Chen et al, 2005; Asselah et al, 2008; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al, 2008) it remained unclear why the endogenous IFN system is ineffective against HCV, whereas therapies with recombinant (pegylated) IFN-a were curative in many patients. Two alternative explanations were discussed: Either some critical ISGs are exclusively induced by pegIFN-a, or pegIFN-a induces the same ISGs but at a higher level than the endogenous IFNs. At first sight, our results indicate that the number of significantly changed ISGs is much higher after pegIFN-a compared to those induced by endogenous IFNs (in high-ISG samples), suggesting that pegIFN-a indeed induces additional ISGs that are not stimulated by endogenous IFNS. However, most of these \"additional\" genes were up-regulated in high-ISG samples as well, albeit to a lesser degree and therefore not passing the significance threshold. Such quantitative differences were also observed for a number of candidate anti-HCV effector ISGs identified in large screens (Schoggins et al, 2011; Metz et al, 2013) . Most of them were significantly stronger induced by pegIFN-a compared to endogenous IFNs, but their expression levels were highly positively correlated between samples treated with pegIFN-a/ ribavirin and samples with high endogenous ISG levels (Fig 7,  Dataset EV10 ). We present six candidate antiviral effectors [IRF1, IRF2, IRF7, IRF9, OASL, IFITM3, reported in both publications cited above (Schoggins et al, 2011; Metz et al, 2013) ] that do not differ significantly between low-ISG and high-ISG patients. However, with the exception of IRF2, these genes also appear to be slightly induced in high-ISG samples compared to low-ISG or non-infected samples, although at lower levels (Fig 7) . Of note, IRF2 stands out because it is induced by pegIFN-a at the 4-h time point, but appears to downregulated by endogenous IFNs (Fig 7) . However, IRF2 is unlikely to be an antiviral effector sensu stricto. IRF2 is a transcriptional regulator involved in IFN induction and in IFN signaling (Ikushima et al, 2013) . Our in vivo analysis therefore could not reliably identify a set of ISG effectors uniquely up-regulated by pegIFN-a that could be responsible for the superior antiviral efficacy of the treatment. Thus, our current analysis for the first time provides strong evidence that quantitative rather than qualitative differences in gene induction are responsible for the failure of the endogenous IFNs and the success of pegIFN-a in viral eradication. We also addressed the contribution of non-coding RNAs to gene regulation in response to HCV infections and to pegIFN-a treatments. Most prominent of them is miR-122, because it is an essential host factor for HCV replication (Jopling et al, 2005) . The fascinating role of the highly abundant miR-122 in HCV replication and virus-host interaction has recently been enriched by the observation that binding of miR-122 by HCV can regulate host gene expression by reducing (sponging) the amount of miR-122 available for gene repression (Luna et al, 2015) . Detailed functional experiments in Huh7 cells brought evidence that HCV infection leads to significant de-repression of miR-122 target genes due to this sponging effect (Luna et al, 2015) . At first sight, our in vivo transcriptomic analysis appeared to confirm this observation, as miR-122 target genes had higher expression levels in HCV-infected compared to control biopsies, more so than genes targeted by all other miRNAs and than genes that are not targets of miRNAs (Figs 2 and 3) . However, a closer look revealed the same pattern for other miRNAs highly expressed in the liver (e.g. miR-192, let-7). Because HCV does not bind these other miRNAs, this observation cannot be simply explained by a sponging effect.",

Strikingly, the primary transcript of miR-122 is part of these downregulated transcripts. Moreover, the genes targeted by these downregulated miRNAs had the highest median expression fold changes following treatment. We note that only subtle differences were observed for the miRNA target genes, which is suggestive of an expression fine-tuning mechanism, although a miRNA-mediated regulatory process is unlikely to be responsible for major expression changes following pegIFN-a treatment. Nevertheless, this observation indicates that the expression changes observed for the primary transcripts are reflected in the mature miRNA levels, as also indicated by our qPCR analysis for three candidate miRNAs. This finding is in agreement with previous evidence that IFN-beta treatment decreases mature miR-122 levels (Pedersen et al, 2007) and that miR-122 levels are lower in patients with endogenous IFN system activation (Sarasin-Filipowicz et al, 2009) . Interestingly, besides miR-122, several other miRNAs whose host genes are down-regulated have been associated with HCV infections and/or interferon treatment. For example, miR-146a was previously reported to inhibit type I interferon production (Hou et al, 2009; Ho et al, 2014) . Its down-regulation following pegIFN-a/treatment might thus allow for a sustained activation of ISGs and thus more effective antiviral response. Another example is miR-192, which was previously proposed as a predictor for the response to IFN treatment (Motawi et al, 2015) . Finally, it is tempting to speculate that the down-regulation of miR-122 levels might contribute to the efficiency of the pegIFN-a/ribavirin treatment in eliminating HCV infections.",

The patients agreed to participate in the study and written informed consent was obtained (approved by the ethics commission of the cantons Basel-Stadt and Basel-Land; approval number EKBBM189/ 99). All patients with CHC were screened for potential response to treatment using a previously published classification method based on the expression values of IFI27, RSAD2, ISG15, and HTATIP2 (Dill et al, 2011) . Patients with high probability of achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) were identified, and in case of planned IFN-based treatment, they were asked to undergo a second liver biopsy. Both biopsies were performed in the morning. Nineteen patients agreed to undergo a second biopsy, as follows: after 4 h (five patients), 16 h (three patients), 48 h (three patients), 96 h (three patients), or 144 h (five patients) of the first therapeutic injection of pegylated interferons (pegIFNs). PegIFNs/Ribavirin doses were set according to HCV genotype and body weight based on standard recommendations. PegIFNs were administered subcutaneously once weekly at the initial dose of 1.5 lg/kg body weight of pegIFNa-2b (Essex Chemie) or 180 lg of pegIFN-a-2a (Roche). Serum HCV RNA was quantified using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test and the COBAS Amplicor Monitor from Roche. Diagnosis of control patients was based on clinical, laboratory, and histopathological assessment. For 18 patients, microarray-based expression analyses of the biopsy material were previously published . One additional patient was included for the 16-h time point.

We determined the protein-coding potential of de novo gene models based on the codon substitution frequency (CSF) score approach (Lin et al, 2007 and on sequence similarity with known protein databases [SwissProt (UniProt, 2015) ] and protein domains [Pfam-A (Finn et al, 2014) ], as previously described (Necsulea et al, 2014) . For the CSF approach, to determine the codon substitution frequencies expected for coding and non-coding regions, we aligned Ensembl-annotated protein-coding sequences and intronic regions, for 9,000 1-1 orthologous gene families for 42 vertebrate species extracted from the Ensembl Compara database (Vilella et al, 2009) . We then counted all observed codon substitutions and constructed coding and non-coding substitution matrices. We downloaded whole-genome alignments for human and 99 other vertebrate genomes from the UCSC Genome Browser (Rosenbloom et al, 2015) and we computed the CSF score in 75-bp sliding windows along the entire human genome, as described previously (Necsulea et al, 2014) . We then extracted all genomic regions with positive CSF scores. As positive CSF scores can appear spuriously on the opposite strand of protein-coding regions (Cabili et al, 2011) , for regions with positive CSF scores on both strands we considered only the strand with the highest score. Gene models were classified as potentially protein-coding if had positive CSF scores over at least 90 bp or 25% of their exonic length. In addition, we searched for sequence similarity between exonic sequences and known proteins from and protein domains from the SwissProt (UniProt, 2015) and Pfam-A (Finn et al, 2014) databases, using blastx (Altschul et al, 1990) . We kept SwissProt proteins with high confidence annotations (protein existence score 1, 2, or 3). We retained blastx hits with e-values below 0.001. Gene models were classified as potentially proteincoding if they had significant blastx hits with SwissProt or Pfam-A protein sequences over at least 90 bp or 5% of their exonic length.",

For protein-coding genes, only protein-coding isoforms were kept, discarding retained introns and other potentially non-functional isoforms. We used two approaches to estimate gene expression levels. First, we estimated gene-based RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) values by counting uniquely mapped RNA-seq reads that overlapped with exon coordinates over at least 5 bp. RNA-seq reads that were mapped to senseoverlapping exonic regions were added to the read count of all corresponding genes. The total number of mapped reads for each sample (corresponding to the M denominator in the RPKM computation) was computed after discarding ambiguously mapped reads and reads that aligned to the mitochondrial genome. We normalized expression levels among samples using a previously described median-scaling procedure, based on the least-varying genes in terms of expression ranks (Brawand et al, 2011) . Second, we used Cufflinks to estimate gene expression levels using all TopHataligned reads, assigning reads with multiple alignments to each gene depending on gene expression levels estimated with unique reads (default multiple read correction procedure in Cufflinks).

To test for differential gene expression between groups of patients (normal liver, CHC high ISG, or CHC low ISG), we compared a model with one explanatory variable (the patient group) and the null model, according to which the patient group has no effect. For the comparison between normal liver, CHC high-ISG and CHC low-ISG patients, we further selected the samples based on their METAVIR score for inflammation and fibrosis (A1/ F1, A1/F2, and A2/F2 samples were kept for further analyses).

In addition, our dataset included different number of patients in the control (6), low-ISG (7), and high-ISG (7) categories, which may affect the statistical power of the analysis. To avoid outlier effects in our differential expression analyses for these comparisons (contrasting non-CHC, low-ISG, and high-ISG patients), we resampled six out seven patients for the low-ISG and high-ISG categories and we performed differential expression analyses with the reduced number of samples. All possible patient combinations were tested separately. We then selected gene expression differences based on their average false discovery rates (FDR) and average log2-fold expression change level across all resampling replicates. The analyses presented in the manuscript correspond to this resampling correction. Similar conclusions were reached when differential expression analyses were performed with all samples (results provided in Dataset EV2). For these comparisons, we considered that genes are differentially expressed if the FDR was below 0.1 and the absolute fold change above 1.5. We voluntarily chose slightly less restrictive FDR and fold change thresholds for these analyses than for the pegIFN-a treatment analysis, to avoid a loss of sensitivity associated with this resampling procedure.",

Second, we used target predictions determined experimentally with HITS-CLIP in Huh7 cells (Luna et al, 2015) . This dataset included binding sites for 50 miRNAs expressed in Huh7 cells. We filtered this dataset to keep only binding sites found in the 3 0 UTR region, and we excluded 6mer binding sites. For the TargetScan dataset, we analyzed only miRNAs that were expressed in normal and HCVinfected liver, as defined above. All data are provided in Dataset EV4. For the analysis of miRNA targets and their expression patterns, we always exclusively analyzed genes that are expressed at an RPKM level of at least 1 in at least one of the relevant samples. For the analysis presented in Fig 8, we computed confidence intervals for the median expression fold change (following pegIFN-a/ribavirin treatment at the 16-h time point) with a bootstrap approach, by resampling the same number of genes 100 times with replacement.

We find that the differences in expression patterns between endogenous IFN activity and recombinant IFN therapy are quantitative rather than qualitative. Most IFN-stimulated genes are induced by both recombinant IFN therapy and the endogenous IFN system, but with lower induction levels in the latter. This indicates that the innate immune response in chronic hepatitis C is too weak to clear the virus. Moreover, we found that a specific class of non-coding genes, which generate microRNAs with regulatory roles, are down-regulated following recombinant IFN therapy.
