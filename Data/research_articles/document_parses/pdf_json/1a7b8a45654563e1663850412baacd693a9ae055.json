Subsequent studies by Tang et al, have demonstrated that approximately 6% of bats sampled in China were positive for CoVs. 29 Interestingly, these CoVs are genetically diverse and many bat CoVs clustered with existing group 1 viruses, while others formed a separate lineage that included only viruses from bats (putative group 5). Other SARS-CoV like viruses clustered in a putative group 4 consisting of two subgroups, one of bat CoVs and another of SARS-CoVs from humans and other mammalian hosts. Although the direct progenitor of the SARS-CoV isolated from palm civets has not been determined, bats are the most likely reservoir of SARS-CoV that infected those animals. Subsequent major genetic variations in the spike gene of the viruses from civet cats seem to have been essential for the transition from animal to human transmission to human to human transmission that eventually caused the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003.",
