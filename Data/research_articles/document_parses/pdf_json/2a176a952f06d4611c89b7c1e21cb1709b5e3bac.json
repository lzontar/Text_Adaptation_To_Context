In MDCK I cells, both virus inoculum concentrations produced detectable titers of progeny within three days (Table 1 ). In the parallel setup, however, MDCK-pi cells did not respond to superinfection by either of the two virus concentrations, which was reproduced in further experiments testing different inoculums. It should be mentioned that reactivation of the suppressed endogeneous virus was not observed within one week in these experiments. Similar results were obtained when fresh MDCK I cells were infected successively with persistent and wild-type virus. After having been used for a transfer of C/AA-pi virus to establish a new state of persistence over 1 month, the cells were subsequently superinfected with C/AA-wt virus.

Bovine brain gangliosides are known to contain the receptor determinant Neu5, 9Ac 2 and have been successfully used to enhance virus uptake by cells de\u00aecient in surface receptors [7] . In this study we performed ganglioside treatment of MDCK-pi cells in the nonproductive phase. As described for Table 1 , the cells were subjected to superinfection with C/AA-wt or C/AA-pi virus, respectively. In a concentration-dependent manner, ganglioside supplementation increased the susceptibility of these host cells to virus infection. Interestingly, the C/AA-pi variant showed slower kinetics of progeny production than wild-type virus (possibly due to defective virus in the egg-grown inoculum), but reached the same quantitative end points. This experiment provides evidence that the low concentration of receptor deter-minants on the MDCK-pi cell surface is a limiting factor for virus uptake. The quantity of sialoglycoproteins containing receptor determinants for in\u00afuenza C virus binding was determined for MDCK-pi cells. Single cell cloning was performed in order to investigate the degree of heterogeneity within the culture. The glycoproteins of individual clones were isolated by wheat germ agglutination and used for an in vitro virus binding assay (Fig. 1) . With MDCK I cells a number of sialoglycoproteins are recognized by in\u00afuenza C virus. Among these, only a protein of 40 kDa is expressed on the cell surface [19] . This protein, termed gp40, appears to be heterogeneous in quantity on uninfected MDCK I cells, as determined by immuno\u00afuorescence staining (G. Zimmer, unpubl. obs.). In the clonal analysis of MDCK-pi cells, neither the gp40 nor any other glycoprotein was recognized by in\u00afuenza C virus, indicating a lack of receptor determinants on these proteins.

MDCK I cells were freshly infected with the persistent virus variant and analyzed 10 days postinfection. Both antigens were mainly detected in the form of a ring-shaped membrane staining. The intensity of labelling was variable for both antigens, i.e. clearly positive signals were restricted to a subset of cells. Hereby gp40 detection was quantitatively reduced in comparison to uninfected cells. Typically, the cell distribution of gp40 and HEF showed an inverse proportion: cells expressing high amounts of HEF were devoid of gp40 and, in opposite, those cells remaining brightly gp40-positive postinfection did not produce viral antigen (not shown). This behaviour re\u00afects the tendency of exclusive surface presentation of either cell receptor or viral receptor-binding protein on each speci\u00aec cell. Given these informations, the signi\u00aecance of receptor levels for virus production during persistence was illustrated by cocultivation tests (Table 3) . Uninfected MDCK I cells were freshly seeded together with an equal number of nonproductive MDCK-pi cells (the latter again having been suppressed in virus production by incubation at nonpermissive temperature). In contrast to MDCKpi cells alone, which remained in the nonproductive state for the test period, the coculture showed a clear shift to enhanced virus synthesis. Apparently, undetected amounts of virus, still disseminated from MDCK-pi cells, were suf\u00aecient to be readily multiplied in the MDCK I cells added.

In comparison to the distinct effect seen with the high-receptor type MDCK I cells (induction to 10.1% positive cells from a basal level of 3.7%) the MDCK II subline offered a low suitability as viral hosts (induction to 4.8% from 3.7%). By pretreatment of MDCK II cells with ganglioside-receptor substitutes, however, the induction in cocultures was increased stepwise to 8.3%. Thus, the difference between the two MDCK coculture hosts may re\u00afect the linkage of cell surface receptor densities with persistent virus production.

A coselection of spontaneous virus mutants, side by side with adapted cell subpopulations seems suggestive, since the stabilization of infected cells surviving the cytopathogenic stress was reported to be crucial ( [3, 16] , H. F. Maassab, unpubl. obs.). In this study we describe the loss of cell susceptibility to in\u00afuenza C virus after persistent infection. Three points of evidence link this effect to reduced receptor concentrations: (i) ganglioside treatment of MDCKpi cells restores the possibility of superinfection, (ii) binding of in\u00afuenza C virus to glycoproteins of MDCK-pi cells in a virus overlay assay is undetectably low and (iii) high-receptor type MDCK I cells, in contrast to lowreceptor type MDCK II, can function as productive acceptor cells in cocultures. The impact of differential receptor expression in a persistently infected cell culture was analyzed in detail for murine coronavirus MHV. A dynamic equilibrium of cells, either susceptible (receptor-positive) or resistant (receptornegative) to infection with MHV, was postulated to regulate the maintenance of persistence [14] . Furthermore in the case of human immunode\u00aeciency virus type 1, a speci\u00aec down-regulation of the CD4-receptor was found to occur regularly during viral persistence in lymphocytes. The viral NEF factor was identi\u00aeed to induce CD4 endocytosis followed by lysosomal degradation, presumably contributing to the HIV-1 persistence mechanism [1] . In analogy, the recently described receptor for measles virus, CD46, is signi\u00aecantly downregulated either after MV infection or after transient expression of the viral hemagglutinin in cultured cells [13] . Persistent infection of monkey kidney cells with MV resulted in the lack of CD46 surface expression [8] . Reduced amounts of a second measles virus receptor, moesin, were also detected in persistently infected human monocytes [6] . These examples, in accordance with the data presented here, indicate a speci\u00aec regulatory function of receptor concentrations in viral persistence. While the in\u00afuence of receptor downregulation is poorly explained in vivo, the in vitro situation suggests the importance of limited viral replication for the bene\u00aet of host cell survival.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 373, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1259, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1599, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1806, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1912, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2038, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Taken together our observations suggest that in vitro persistence of in\u00afuenza C virus is established under continuous reduction of the amount of cell surface receptors. As a consequence, virus ampli\u00aecation by superinfection of cells is suppressed and the total virus production of the culture was determined to remain in a restricted range, facilitating host cell survival. In an extreme case, virus transfer within the persistently infected culture is suggestive to be maintained exclusively on the viral RNA genome level by cell division. This statement is supported by the \u00aending that nonproductive phases, even over months, do not terminate the state of persistence. To the contrary, nonproductive phases are characterized by the maintenance of C/AA-pi virus genomes in every single cell and by the possibility of reactivation ( [12] M. M., unpubl. obs.). Reactivation of infectious virus production might initiate from productive centers (as visualized in Fig. 2 ). Subsequently, enhanced virus spread could be connected with the capability of MDCK I cells to restore their surfaces with sialoglycoproteins, e.g. as reported for the rapid turn-over of gp40 [19] . The mechanism of receptor down-regulation, however, has still to be clari\u00aeed. The most obvious explanation is the selection of low-receptor type cells, mediated by the permanent presence of viral receptor-destroying enzyme activity. Another possibility is given by the modi\u00aeed intracellular events during long-term viral replication. Presumably viral products interfere with the expression and transport of cellular proteins.
