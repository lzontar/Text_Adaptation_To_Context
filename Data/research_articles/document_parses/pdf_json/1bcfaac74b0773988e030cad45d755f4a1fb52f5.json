The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, already appear to be impacting on people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is likely that many countries will experience a 'wave' of COVID19 related mental disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as social isolation; child-maltreatment; intimate partner violence; unemployment; housing and income stress; workplace trauma; and grief and loss. The 'two-pronged' approach used to deal with COVID19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is particularly important to 'flatten the curve' and avoid a surge in incidence of mental disorders stemming from the COVID19 pandemic. Many evidence-based interventions designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up. These interventions include parenting programs, social and emotional learning programs, self-care strategies, and workplace mental wellbeing programs, among others.",

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic is one the biggest challenges the global community has faced. Across the world, scores of countries have imposed strict physical distancing and socioeconomic lock-down measures to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The sudden and dramatic changes to people's lives and livelihoods are creating high levels of stress among people across the world. Much of this stress is a normal and hopefully temporary reaction to the new and uncertain nature of the situation and the social and economic disruption it has created.",

Since many schools are closed it may be possible to utilise this opportunity to offer educators intensive training in these prevention-focused programs so they can implement them effectively when students return to the classroom.
