Based on the data of 154 individuals from 26 provinces, age remained a key mortality risk factor among geriatric patients of different ages. While dyspnoea and chest pain/discomfort were more commonly seen in deceased patients as they represented severe pneumonia, fever was more prominent in surviving patients. This was likely due to the lower baseline body temperature observed in elderly which translated to a lower maximum temperature of fever. However, lowering the threshold temperature for fever is not recommended in surveillance. Instead, baseline body temperature measured on a regular basis should be used to define the threshold temperature for fever.

In fact, the data in the present study suggested that patients without fever were more likely to be older (crude OR 0.952. 95% CI 0.910, 0.996). This phenomenon is not uncommon and perhaps overlooked. A recent study reviewing the clinical features of COVID-19 patients admitted to Hainan General Hospital found significant difference in the prevalence of fever between young and middle-aged, and elderly patients 15 . However, the authors did not further discuss this finding. It has also been suggested that approximately 20%-30% of elderly patients with serious bacterial or viral infection presented with a blunted or even no fever 16 . It is likely because of the lower baseline body temperature in elderly due to aging [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] which may translate to a lower maximum temperature of fever 16 . This suggests that the usual temperature threshold for fever should not be used as a case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients. In fact, a study on a total of 111 nursing home residents found that lowering the threshold for a clinically significant fever increased the sensitivity of detecting infections 22 . However, it is not recommended to lower the temperature threshold in the case definition of COVID-19 in geriatric patients because an individual's baseline body temperature is also determined by a range of demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and physiological measurements 18 . To assist surveillance against the current pandemic, elderly should measure on a regular basis the baseline body temperature that can be used to define the threshold temperature for fever. If this is not feasible, a baseline body temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius might be used instead 19 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 236, "end": 238, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 654, "end": 656, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 876, "end": 878, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 965, "end": 969, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 975, "end": 979, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 980, "end": 984, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 985, "end": 989, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1052, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1370, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1654, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1947, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Studies concerning the association between comorbid conditions and mortality/disease severity in the Chinese COVID-19 patients of all ages showed mixed results.
