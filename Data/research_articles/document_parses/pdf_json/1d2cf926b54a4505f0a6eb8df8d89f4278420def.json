Whatever the lateral pressure, in the amide I region, the main contribution around 1627 cm \u22121 is characteristic of \u03b2-sheets. A shoulder around 1650 cm \u22121 , characteristic of \u03b1helix, is present whatever the lateral pressure and increases with compression. The weak amide II contribution whatever the spectrum shows that the structures are mainly laying flat at the interface and that the orientation does not significantly changes with lateral pressure increase [56] . To have a better insight on the secondary structure, the difference spectrum between lipids and absence and presence of SFV21 at comparable lateral pressure was calculated (Fig. 5B ). For this, separate PMIRRAS measurements with monolayers of the pure lipids were registered at the same surface pressure and we assume that these spectra can be used for the subtraction. The data clearly show that the two main secondary structure contributions are due to the 1650 cm \u2212 1 and 1627 cm \u22121 bands, and that their respective proportions vary depending on the applied lateral pressure. One can observe that the position of the alpha helical and beta sheet components of the amide I band in Fig. 5A remains unchanged in all spectra whereas some differences in position and shape of some of the amide I bands appear in Fig. 5B . This can mainly be explained by the fact that this region of the spectrum (broad negative dip around 1650 cm \u22121 associated with the deformation vibrational mode of liquid water [57] ) is sensitive to the interface coverage, then small differences in the pure lipid film organisation compared to the mixed SFV21/lipid film can lead to small distortions. To minimize these effects and assuming that the main contributions to the secondary structures are due to these bands and that the orientation does not change significantly, the area of the band was estimated and the respective proportion of both secondary structures calculated using three independent experiments. The results are summarized in Table 1 for Ri = 20 and Ri = 75. The values show that whatever the Ri, at low lateral pressure, the \u03b2-sheet structure is largely predominant. The \u03b2-sheet proportion decreases with lateral pressure increase while the \u03b1-helix proportion increases. The \u03b1-helical proportion becomes predominant from 15 mN/m (55,5%) at Ri = 75, while it slowly increases up to 48% for 35mN/m at Ri = 20. These results show a progressive secondary structure transition from \u03b2-sheet to \u03b1-helix induced by compression of the monolayer, the behaviour is more pronounced for the higher Ri (75), then the lower SFV21 content. This behaviour demonstrates a structural flexibility of the SFV21 sequence and shows that the conformation is both sensitive to lateral pressure and to the presence of lipids. During decompression, the transition is not reversible since the \u03b1-helix predominates compared to the \u03b2-sheet whatever the RI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 644, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 856, "end": 860, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1415, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2415, "end": 2419, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 13, "end": 20, "text": "(Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 731, "end": 740, "text": "(Fig. 5A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1598, "text": "(Fig. 5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2108, "text": "Fig. 5A", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2235, "text": "Fig. 5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 2937, "end": 2944, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Morphological and structural study of SFV21 inserted into a lipid monolayer"}, {"text": "To estimate the effect of the SFV21 incorporation on the lipid chain organization, the position of the band corresponding to asymmetric stretching modes of the methylene groups, \u03bd as (CH 2 ), was measured Table 2 ) since it is sensitive to the lipid chain order [58] [59] [60] .

The band around 1735 cm \u22121 corresponds to the v(C = O) ester of the lipids while the 1700-1600 cm \u22121 domain corresponds to the amide I. The amide I region was analyzed and the secondary structure content was evaluated from the analysis of the amide I band shape and curve fitting (Supplementary data S2) [39] . The 1685 \u00b1 1 cm \u2212 1 , 1632 \u00b1 1 cm \u2212 1 and 1624 \u00b1 1 cm \u22121 bands were assigned to \u03b2-sheets, the 1664 cm \u22121 and 1653 \u00b1 1 cm \u22121 bands to \u03b1-helices, the 1642 \u00b1 2 cm \u22121 band to random structures and the 1675 \u00b1 2 cm \u22121 band to \u03b2-turns. The results, presented in Table 3 , show that the predominant structures are the \u03b1-helices and the \u03b2-sheets. There is a progressive interconversion from the predominant \u03b1-helices (41,0% at Ri = 150) to the \u03b2-sheets (37,2% at Ri = 20) with peptide concentration. The other structures, \u03b2-turns and random, counts respectively for around 10% and 20% and their proportion remains constant whatever the Ri. Using the p-and s-polarized spectra, we then estimated the dichro\u00efc ratio of the amide I band of the \u03b1-helix (1664/1653 cm \u22121 ) and of the \u03b2-sheet (1632/1624 cm \u22121 ) presented in Table 3 . The evolution of R ATR (amide I) for the \u03b1-helix from 1.44 (Ri = 150) up to values between 1.8 and 2.0 demonstrates a progressive reorientation of the \u03b1-helix tilt angle from around 70\u00b0to 0-20\u00a8compared to the interface normal [12] . This means that when diluted in the lipids, the helix is mainly laying flat on the membrane while its becomes perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer at higher concentration. Concerning the \u03b2-sheet, the weak variation of R ATR (amide I) allows to estimate a tilt angle around 35\u00b0relative to the membrane plane, this orientation does not significantly depends on the peptide concentration [12] . To investigate the consequence of SFV21 bilayer incorporation on the organization of the lipid acyl chains in the bilayer, the shift of the bands corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the methylene groups, \u03bd s (CH 2 ) and \u03bd as (CH 2 ), respectively, were measured (Table 4) . Indeed, the wavenumbers of these bands are known to be sensitive to changes in the configuration of the acyl chains, in chain mobility and packing [53] [54] [55] [56] . The \u03bd s (CH 2 ) and \u03bd as (CH 2 ) of 2851.7 and 2920.7 cm \u2212 1 respectively for the bilayer alone are characteristic of quite well ordered acyl chains, which is consistent with a bilayer composed of phospholipids with phase transition temperature higher than 23\u00b0C. When SFV21 is added to the bilayer, there is an increase up to 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 cm \u22121 at Ri = 20 in the wavenumbers of the \u03bd s (CH 2 ) and \u03bd as (CH 2 ) which indicates a decrease in chain order due to SFV21 peptide incorporation (Table 4 ). This is confirmed by the evolution of the dichroic ratio (R ATR ) of the \u03bd s (CH 2 ) band of lipid chains which was measured on the polarized ATR spectra (Table 4) . Indeed, since the transition moment for the \u03bd s (CH 2 ) lies perpendicular to the chain axis, the introduction of order or disorder alters the direction of the main chain with respect to the normal of the ATR crystal. The dichroic ratio is then expected to provide a sensitive and quantitative indicator of acyl chain order by estimating the average C\\ \\C\\ \\C angle of the lipid carbon chains with the normal to the interface [12, 27] . Here, the R ATR increases when SFV21 interacts with the lipids, compared to the lipid alone (Table 4) . This corresponds to a reorientation of the lipid chains from approximately 45\u00b0defined to the membrane normal to 60-65\u00b0in presence of SFV21 at Ri = 150 and 75. A R ATR value of 1,93 obtained at Ri = 20 is characteristic of an important disorder of the bilayer, close to the isotropy [12] . Conversely, the dichro\u00efc ratio of the \u03bd(C = O) ester band of the lipids increases from 1.67 for the lipid alone to around 2.00 in the presence of SFV21 at Ri = 75 and 20 which is characteristic of an important increase of disorder. Altogether, this experiment is showing SFV21 insertion leads to disorder increase in both the acyl chains and the glycerol region of the lipids, but the glycerol region is sensitive at higher Ri compared to the acyl chains.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 630, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1683, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2076, "end": 2080, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2530, "end": 2534, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2535, "end": 2539, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2540, "end": 2544, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2549, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3641, "end": 3645, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3646, "end": 3649, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4038, "end": 4042, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 249, "end": 255, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 888, "end": 895, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1450, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2380, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 3037, "end": 3045, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 3203, "end": 3212, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 3744, "end": 3753, "text": "(Table 4)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Study of SFV21 inserted into lipid bilayers"}, {"text": "The structural studies of SFV21 show a sensitivity of its conformation whether the conditions used.

At low lateral pressure at the air/ water interface (with or without lipid), the main conformation of SFV21 is the antiparallel \u03b2-sheet. This structure may be favoured by the large surface available since \u03b2-sheets occupy a larger area at the interface than \u03b1-helices and by the fact that the hydrophobicity of the air/water interface may favour changes in the hydrogen bonding interactions [61, 62] . Increasing lateral pressure for pure SFV21 monolayer at the air water interface only leads to weak changes in the proportions and/or orientation of the minor structural components as shown by PMIRRAS spectra. The addition of lipids leads to a different structural behaviour of SFV21 by increasing lateral pressure of the mixed lipid/ peptide monolayer with a progressive increase of the \u03b1-helix contribution. This phenomenon demonstrates a specific interaction of SFV21 with lipids which can modify the hydrogen bonding network. Such interactions are also prooved by the formation of aggregates at the air/ water interface when SFV21 is inserted into the lipid monolayer, while no aggregates are observed both for the pure lipid and the pure SFV21 film (BAM microscopy and ellipsometry). In further studies it could then be interesting to investigate potential specific interactions of SFV21 fusion peptide with cholesterol which is present at high content in the membrane composition used (30% molar) since SFV alphavirus fusion with host cells is characterized by a striking requirement for cholesterol in the target membrane [3] . Cholesterol effect on membrane fusion has been extensively studied, and cholesterol demonstrated to be necessary for very different fusion processes as neuronal exocytosis [63] and viral entry. Indeed several recent studies on viruses as different as Influenza [64] , Human or Feline Immunodeficiency Virus [65] [66] [67] [68] , Herpes Simplex virus [69] demonstrate the potential role of cholesterol or cholesterol-enriched domains (rafts) as possible platforms for the entry of viruses into cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 494, "end": 498, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 499, "end": 502, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1636, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1815, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1904, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1946, "end": 1950, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1955, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1960, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1965, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 1993, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influence of environmental conditions on SFV21 conformation"}, {"text": "It is also interesting to compare our results on SFV21 to these obtained for the putative fusion peptide VT18 of Chikungunya alphavirus using NMR spectroscopy in zwitterionic lipid environments [31] . VT18 is an 18 residue-long peptide which shares 13 residues with SFV21 (VYPFMWGGAYCFC). In the conditions used (DPC micelles at diluted lipid to peptide ratio around 250), authors do not observe significant contribution of \u03b1-helices as we observe in lipid bilayers in diluted conditions but rather extended or \u03b2-type conformations for most of the residues. Authors compare the NMR derived DPC bound structure of VT18 with that of the conformation deduced in the context of protein complexes (prefusion state) obtained by X-ray crystallography [70] . They show that the micelle-bound structure of the fusion peptide, VT18, markedly differs in terms of packing interactions of some aromatic residues compared to the the X-ray structure and conclude that the lipidic environment of DPC micelles led to a significant conformational reorganization of the aromatic residues in the fusion peptide. This result is in agreement with the observation that the conformation of fusion peptides is very sensitive to the lipid environment as well as the experimental conditions used. Concerning VT18, authors also observe that residues MWGG adopt a type I \u03b2-turn conformation with the Nand C-termini pointing in an antiparallel orientation. In our case, we show that in lipid bilayer environment, the proportions of random and \u03b2-turn structure remain rather constant whatever the Ri (\u2248 20% and \u22489% respectively). It cannot be excluded that this relatively high but conserved proportion of random and \u03b2-turn could be due to this part of the sequence. One can also speculate that the presence of such a \u03b2-turn will result in a partial folding of SFV21 into intramolecular antiparallel \u03b2-sheet for the residues close to the turn, the structural plasticity resulting from the N-and C-terminal part of the sequence and from the 8 residues which are not present in the VT18 sequence.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 194, "end": 198, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 744, "end": 748, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influence of environmental conditions on SFV21 conformation"}, {"text": "It is then interesting to see that the conformational flexibility observed for SFV21 fusion peptide of class II is also shared by viral fusion peptide of class I (HIV1, paramyxovirus, Ebola [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] ) and SNARE proteins involved in intracellular fusion process [71] .

A conformational transition from an \u03b1-helix to a \u03b2-sheet is induced by a change in the peptide to lipid ratio in the membrane. At low concentration in lipids, SFV21 interacts with lipids mainly as \u03b1-helices. As the local peptide concentration increases in the membrane, the proportion of \u03b1-helix drops off in favor of a mainly antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure. The formation of antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure is probably due to peptide self-assembling triggered by close peptide contacts induced by increasing their concentration (Fig. 7) . This is confirmed by the aggregates which are observed in presence of SFV21 by BAM and ellipsometry. This concentration dependent effect on peptide conformation might be of biological relevance during the formation of the trimers of hairpins composed of \u03b2-sheets as seen in the post-fusion state of class II fusion proteins. Formation of fusion oligomers was already suggested for class I viruses like HIV to be linked to fusion activity for both envelope protein-mediated fusion and for liposome fusion mediated by fusion peptides [72, 73] . For instance, in the case of the fusion peptide of the Senda\u00ef virus [74] , the peptide could self-assemble in its membrane-bound state, thus suggesting its role in assisting the assembly of the envelope protein of the virus. This structural plasticity with formation of \u03b2-sheets as fusogenic conformation, may then promote membrane topological changes during fusion. Indeed, we observe by ATR spectroscopy that while the proportion of the \u03b2-sheets increases with the SFV21 concentration, the \u03b2sheets remain tilted compared to the interface plane of the bilayer (35\u00b0), which lead to important disorder in the lipid chain organisation as observed by the increase of the R ATR and of the wavenumber of bands characteristic of the stretching of the chain acyl groups. Conversely, while the proportion of \u03b1-helix decreases with SFV21 concentration increase, their orientation becomes perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer, which may result in a weaker perturbation of the lipid chain organization but a destabilization of the lipid head groups [12] . It is also interesting to notice that we do not observe this orientationnal change with the monolayer lipid model. Such a difference may be due to the fact that a lipid monolayer does not match correctly the hydrophobic thickness of a membrane and does not allow a proper orientation of SFV21 \u03b1-helix which is then too long to match the hydrophobic part of the lipids. Therefore, even if the monolayer system allows the detection of the structural plasticity of SFV21, the lipid bilayer model seems to be more relevant in mimicking the biological membrane and the orientation of SFV21 in such a system will be more representative of the reality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1337, "end": 1341, "text": "[72,", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1345, "text": "73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1420, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2401, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 254, "end": 263, "text": "(Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 794, "end": 802, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "SFV21 interaction with model membranes"}, {"text": "Such a process of lipid bilayer disorganization should be essential during membrane fusion processes by generating new lipid phases that are thought to be associated with initial steps of membrane fusion by increasing the negative curvature strain, favoring the formation of inverted phases [75, 76] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 295, "text": "[75,", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 296, "end": 299, "text": "76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SFV21 interaction with model membranes"}, {"text": "To conclude, the present study shows the structural plasticity of SFV21 fusion peptide and demonstrates its ability to transit from a mainly \u03b1-helical structure to antiparallel \u03b2-sheets leading to a destabilization at large scale of the lipid membrane.
