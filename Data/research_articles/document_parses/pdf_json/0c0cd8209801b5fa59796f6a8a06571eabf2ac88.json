Coronavirus had not yet been successfully cultured from tears or conjunctival swabs in humans, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor SARS-CoV. However, live feline coronavirus has been isolated from conjunctival swabs. In addition, infection of COVID-19 through unprotected eye exposure had been suspected in several articles. Reports of ophthalmologists and otolaryngologists died of COVID-19 also raised concern on ocular transmission. As a result, we strongly suggest that personal protective equipment (PPE) should cover the mouth, nose, and eyes of ophthalmologists, especially when conjunctivitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 is clinically indistinguishable from other viral follicular conjunctivitis.

All samples were negative even in those eyes that later developed conjunctivitis with PCR-proved identical virus with the first eyes. In addition, given the characteristic of nonenveloped structure, viral spreading requires cell lysis. Hence, the possibility of viral spreading is very small before onset of symptoms. This is possibly the reason why we could not find available incidence data for HAdV in Table. Similarly to other enveloped viruses, the release of SARS-CoV-2 does not require the process of host cell lysis. This is less immunogenic compared with the disruption of the host cell. Hence, Sungnak et al 18 speculated this could be the mechanism of transmission in presymptomatic cases.
