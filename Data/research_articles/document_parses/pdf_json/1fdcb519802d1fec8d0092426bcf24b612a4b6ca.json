For example, China closed down large areas almost completely to increase social distance; South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts; and many European countries try to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies , i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and that should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population in time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available at each time point. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). Two main scenarios were tested with several variants. The first, a mitigation strategy , aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. The other, a suppression strategy , consists of the same mobility restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their Tuomisto et al.

Both take as their starting point the actual situation as of 2020-04-06. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30-40% mobility reduction appears able to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not to suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20-25% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction during the first year of the cumulative number infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy. Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes of various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While latter are important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, the mitigation strategy aiming to slow down the epidemic mainly via social isolation appears to be a destructive policy, i.e. a policy that has, based on scientific knowledge, better alternatives. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population model and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas have tackled differently the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the novel coronavirus labelled SARS-CoV-2). There are disparate views about whether the pandemic is stoppable and what the crucial actions to be taken are. For example, South Korea has done extensive testing of symptomatic people and their contacts, including asymptomatic ones, and then isolated all that show a positive test result (Normile, 2020) . In contrast, Great Britain was originally going for minimal action policy with an idea to let people develop herd immunity, but only a week later they switched to strict social isolation policy (Boseley, 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 436, "end": 451, "text": "(Normile, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 648, "end": 663, "text": "(Boseley, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "There are two main approaches to the coronavirus crisis. First, one can assume that a pandemic is already so widespread globally that it will inevitably infect a large fraction of the population. Then the key thing is to slow down the spread in each country so that the health care system can cope with the COVID-19 patients, many of which need intensive care with respirators. Eventually, the epidemic fades away due to herd immunity, i.e. there are enough recovered people to prevent effective spread of the virus in the population. This is called the mitigation strategy and often referred to as \"flattening the curve\". Depending on the still debated fatality and intensive care requirements of COVID-19, the mitigation strategy may require a very long time frame of slow-down measures to allow the health care system to cope. This in turn could lead to unacceptable damage to the economy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Second, one can assume that the disease can (and must) be suppressed so that only a small number of patients shall exist in the population. Rather than relying on herd immunity like in mitigation, suppression has to be actively maintained by isolating infected people. Total eradication in any one country is impossible in practice as long as the disease is still common in other countries. The epidemic is kept under control by actively searching for all patients (including those without symptoms) and isolating them so that the infection chains are cut. This is called the suppression strategy, sometimes referred to as \"the hammer and the dance\" in mass media. The \"hammer\" refers to concerted actions of mobility restrictions and coronavirus testing to get the numbers of infected patients down; and the \"dance\" is a delicate balance of opening up the society and partially removing mobility restrictions while still maintaining the capacity to trace and isolate all patients (Pueyo, 2020) .

In this case the population-level consequences would also be moderate because there would be fewer severe cases.

As of writing, Finland's latest clearly communicated objective is still to just slow down the epidemic, corresponding to the mitigation strategy. However, the suppression strategy is increasingly discussed by the health authorities and is clearly being evaluated as potentially a better option. Moreover, the very stringent mobility restrictions currently in place appear based on the REINA model to be sufficient to practically eradicate the virus if continued until fall 2020. The mitigation strategy would call for relaxation of restrictions, and this has been modelled by under the mitigation strategy simulations discussed in this study.
