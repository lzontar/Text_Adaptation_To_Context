The close phylogenetic 121 relationship also implies that much of our knowledge of SARS-CoV molecular biology, 122 accumulated over the past 17 years, can probably be translated to SARS-CoV-2. Many reports 123 posted over the past months have described such similarities, including the common affinity 124 of the two viruses for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (9, 31). This 125 receptor is abundantly expressed in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells). Since 126 2003, Vero cells have been used extensively for SARS-CoV research in cell culture-based 127 infection models by many laboratories, including our own. 128 We set out to establish the basic features of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells and 129 compare it to the Frankfurt-1 SARS-CoV isolate from 2003 (32, 33) .

Using pseudotyped 483 virions carrying mutant S proteins of SARS-CoV (65) or SARS-CoV-2 (66), it was shown that 484its presence minimally impacts S protein functionality. In the SARS-CoV S protein, an adjacent 485 sequence that is conserved across CoVs can be cleaved by other host proteases like 486 cathepsin L or TMPRSS2 (67-69), thus providing an alternative pathway to trigger viral entry. 487", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF10": {"text": "594immunosuppressive cyclosporin A analogue Alisporivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, as 595 demonstrated previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (58).

Rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during passaging in Vero E6 cells. (a) Outline of 939 a plaque picking experiment that was initiated when the p2 stock of SARS-CoV-2 940 Australia/VIC01/2020 showed remarkable plaque heterogeneity on Vero E6 cells (leftmost 941 well). Following a plaque assay of the p1 virus stock, small and large plaques were picked and 942 these virus clones were passaged three times in Vero E6 cells, while their plaque phenotype 943 was monitored. In contrast to the large plaque viruses (example L8; bottom row), the plaque 944 phenotype of the small plaque viruses (example S5; top row) rapidly evolved within these 3 945 passages. (b) Evolution/adaptation of the S protein gene during Vero E6 passaging. Overview 946 of NGS data obtained for the p2 stock, S5p1/p2/p3 and S8p1 in the S1/S2 region of the SARS-947 CoV-2 S protein gene that encodes the so-called 'furin-like cleavage site. The analysis was 948 based on NGS reads spanning nt 23,576 to 23,665 of the SARS-CoV genome (see Methods 949 for details) and their translation in the S protein open reading frame. Deletions are indicated 950 with \u0394 followed by the affected amino acid residues. 951 Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells. 953 (a) Growth curve showing the release of infectious viral progeny into the medium of infected 954 Vero E6 cells (m.o.i. 3), as determined by plaque assay (n = 4; mean \u00b1 sd is presented).

The table shows the 966 average of these three measurements. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA sizes were calculated on the 967 basis of the position of the leader and body transcription-regulatory sequences (ACGAAC) in 968 the viral genome (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995, Xu, Hu et al. 2003). 969 Cross-reactivity of antisera raised against SARS-CoV structural and non-971 structural proteins. 972 Selected antisera previously raised against SARS-CoV nsps and structural proteins cross-973 react with corresponding SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

SARS-CoV-2 isolate 160Australia/VIC01/2020 (GeneBank ID: MT007544.1; (34)) was derived from a positively-testing 161 nasopharyngeal swab in Melbourne, Australia, and was propagated twice in Vero/hSLAM 162 cells, before being shared with other laboratories. In Leiden, the virus was passaged two more 163 times at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) in Vero E6 cells to obtain a working stock (p2 stock).164 SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt 1 (36) was used to compare growth kinetics and other features 165 with SARS-CoV-2. Infection of Vero E6 cells was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline 166 (PBS) containing 50 \u00b5g/ml DEAE-dextran and 2% fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco). The 167 inoculum was added to the cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, after which cells were washed twice with PBS 168 and maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza) with 2% FCS, 2mM L-169 glutamine (PAA) and antibiotics (Sigma). Viral titres were determined by plaque assay in Vero 170 E6 cells as described previously (37). For plaque picking, plaque assays were performed using 171 our p1 stock, while using an overlay containing 1% of agarose instead of Avicel (RC-581; FMC 172 Biopolymer). Following neutral red staining, small and large plaques were picked and used to 173 inoculate a 9.6-cm 2 dish of Vero E6 cells containing 2 ml of EMEM-2%FCS medium, yielding 174 p1 virus. After 48 h, 200 \u00b5l of the culture supernatant was used to infect the next dish of cells 175 (p2), a step that was repeated one more time to obtain p3 virus.
