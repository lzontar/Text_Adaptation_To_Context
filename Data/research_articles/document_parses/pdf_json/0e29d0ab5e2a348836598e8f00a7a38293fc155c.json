This study aimed to assess reliability of SFs to identify the T18 spinous process (SP). Part 1 investigated agreement between T18 (T18SF) as identified by three SFs using palpation and a veterinary surgeon (VS) using radiography (T18VS) in seven horses. SF1 and SF2 palpated the lumbosacral joint and counted cranially six SPs, whereas SF3 followed the rib curvature toward the dorsal midline. In part 2, SF1 and SF2 identified T18 by counting cranially five SPs in seven horses on two occasions. Agreement between SFs and VS was assessed using t tests and Bland-Altman plots. Interrater and intrarater reliability were estimated using intraclass correlation coefficients. In part 1, SF1 and SF2 found T18SF 4.3 cm (AE4.1 and 4.0 cm, respectively) cranial to T18VS. Mean difference between T18SF3 and T18VS was 0.1 AE 4.9 cm (95% CI: \u00c09.5 cm, 9.6 cm). When counting cranially five SPs, mean difference between T18SF1 and T18VS was \u00c01.5 AE 3.4 cm (95% CI: \u00c08.3 cm; 5.1 cm) and T18SF2 and T18VS was \u00c00.3 cm AE 4.5 cm (95% CI: \u00c08.8 cm; 8.5 cm). Interrater reliability was 'good' (ICC = 0.798 These results indicate that counting cranially five SPs from the lumbosacral joint, when coupled with observation of the rib position and curvature should ensure a saddle is not placed beyond T18.",

The number of signs exhibited by each horse before and after CT removal was compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test. Before the operation, avoidance behaviours, such as evading the bit, difficulties in eating, and even asocial or aggressive behaviours were commonly reported by the owners. Removing the infected tooth significantly reduced the number of these behavioral patterns expressed by the horses, suggesting that they could be associated with dental pain. Half of the cases had been diagnosed during a routine dental examination, indicating that many owners did not realise that certain undesirable behavioural patterns of their horses might be associated with dental pain.",
