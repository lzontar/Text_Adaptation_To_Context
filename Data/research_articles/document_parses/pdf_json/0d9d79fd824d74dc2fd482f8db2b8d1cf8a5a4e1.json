However, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated it as the SARS-CoV-2 virus[4]. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the disease caused by this novel virus as coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19). The repeated emergence and outbreaks of CoVs indicate a public health threat. This suggests the possibility of animal-to-human and humanto-human transmission of newly emerging CoVs.
