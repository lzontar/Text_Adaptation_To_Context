The emergence of novel respiratory viruses such as the SARS-CoV-2 creates dramatic challenges to the healthcare services, including surgical pathology laboratories, despite their extensive daily experience in dealing with biological and chemical hazards. Here, we cover important aspects on the knowledge on COVID-19 gathered during the first six months of the pandemic and address relevant issues on human biological sample handling in the Anatomic Pathology laboratory in the context of COVID-19 global threat. In addition, we detail our strategy to minimize the risk of contamination upon exposure to the different biological products received in the laboratory, which can be of general interest to other laboratories worldwide. Our approach has enabled a safe work environment for laboratory staff, while ensuring the maintenance of high quality standards of the work performed. In times of uncertainty and given the lack of specific guidelines directed at Anatomic Pathology services to better deal with the global COVID-19 public-health emergency, it is essential to share with the community rigorous methodologies that will enable us to better cope with probable novel waves of COVID-19 infection and other viruses that will possibly arise in the near future.",

The pandemic, whose first cases were initially detected in the city of Wuhan, China, quickly spread to other Asian countries, to Europe and is currently in full expansion in the American continent, with also significant number of cases in Africa and Australia. As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, healthcare services worldwide need to adopt new approaches and re-adapt to the challenges posed by this novel respiratory virus. The Anatomic Pathology laboratory, which deals with human biological samples must also prepare itself to deal with these challenges and continue to offer high-standard services to all the patients, while guaranteeing that its administrative staff, technicians, trainees, and pathologists work in a safe environment.",

            "text": "In Portugal, the first two cases of COVID-19 were reported on March 2 nd 2020, in the Northern region and the first case was diagnosed at Hospital and University Center of Porto. Both cases were related with recent visits to Italy during the second half of the month of February. Nearly three months after the first reported cases the number of confirmed cases is increasing in a steady fashion up to 37000 cases, with more than 1500 deaths. 2 On March 18 th 2020, the Portuguese government declared the emergency state and enforced a nationwide lockdown which lasted until May 2 nd 2020. As a result of the lockdown and social distancing measures, the rate of new infections is currently less than 1% in most of the territory, except for the greater Lisbon area, which is facing a novel surge of COVID-19 infections, accounting for nearly 90% of novel cases reported in Portugal during the first week of June. 2 In addition, most experts warn that a second and more deadly wave of COVID19 could arise during the fall/winter season of 2020, similarly to what happened during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. 3 In March 2020, the measures established by the Portuguese government and Ministry of Health aimed at the National Health System with an impact on the activity of the surgical pathology laboratory were mainly two: most hospitals diverged their efforts towards the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, thus non-urgent scheduled surgeries and complementary diagnostic techniques were cancelled or postponed; and all autopsies started being performed at the National Institute for Forensic Medicine, with the accompanying requisition form mentioning the results of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Altogether, this led to a global reduction in the amount of cytology, biopsies J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and surgical specimens received in the Anatomic Pathology laboratory, yet we kept the laboratory running and had to deliver high quality results, while assuring the biosafety of the healthcare professionals. The Portuguese Anatomic Pathology College recommendations focused on reinforcing the usage of individual protective measures in line with laboratory guidelines devised by the General Directorate of Health [Dire\u00e7\u00e3o Geral de Sa\u00fade (DGS)] and the national good practices manual of Anatomic Pathology with special attention to cytology laboratories. These recommendations alerted that the effectiveness of the deactivation of the virus by commercial methanol-based fixators has not been proven and therefore suggests that the handling of cytology products should be carried out in a class II biological safety cabinet (BSC2); and if not available the technician must wear an FFP2 respirator mask. None of the recommendations used as reference [from World Health Organization (WHO) 4 and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 5 ] provided accurate risk analysis and delivered specific measures to prevent contamination and contagion within an Anatomic Pathology laboratory, other than those directed at Clinical Pathology laboratories for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.",

            "text": "On December 31 st 2019, a group of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in China's Hubei province, epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market, which rapidly spread to other Chinese and Asian cities. 7 On January 3 rd 2020, a novel coronavirus in the SARS-CoV phylogenetic clade identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples was reported as the causative agent of these uncommon pneumonia cases. 8 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern on 30 th January 2020. On February 11 th 2020 the responsible virus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and the associated disease is now globally known as COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11 th 2020. 9 The SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses and like the 2003 SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (\u03b2-CoV lineage B). 7 SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus emerging in the last 17 years and the seventh coronavirus type demonstrated to infect humans: SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease, whereas the other four are associated only with mild symptoms. 10 The origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be established with proposed theories ranging from the bats (it shares 96% of its sequence with a coronavirus found in bats) till laboratory generation and leakage. 10 The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus containing nearly 30000 bases, with 50-200 nm in diameter. 7 Similarly to other coronaviruses, it has four structural proteins: the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). 11 The viral envelope is created by the S, E, and M proteins, while the N protein holds the RNA genome. 12 The spike protein allows the virus to attach to and fuse with the host cell membrane. 12 The SARS-CoV-2 has affinity to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells, which it uses as mechanism of cell entry. 13 Once the viral RNA is released into the cell, it will force the cell to produce and disseminate copies of its own, leading to the SARS-CoV-2 infection of even more cells. 13 The clinical presentation of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic, to mild symptoms (including fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste) or severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and multi-organ failure, which may lead to death. 14 In nearly 80% of the cases the COVID-19 infection causes mild disease, while severe disease occurs in 15% of the patients, with dyspnea, hypoxia and >50% lung involvement on imaging within 24-48 hours. 15 In about 5% of the patients a life-threatening disease develops, with respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ dysfunction, requiring intensive care unit medical care with mechanical ventilation. 16 In Portugal, in the first months of the pandemic, the most frequent presenting symptom was cough (40%), followed by fever (29%), myalgia (21%), headache (20%), general malaise (15%) and breathing impairment (11%). 2 The diagnose COVID-19 infection mainly relies on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab or other upper respiratory tract specimens, including throat swab or saliva. 17 In most cases of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, the viral RNA is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f already detected one day after symptom onset and peaks during the first week. 17 However, accumulating evidence suggests that the virus genome has been suffering different mutations worldwide, which could pose significant extra challenges in the diagnosis using rRT-PCR in nearly 14% of the cases. 18 The imaging methods, namely chest x-ray and chest CT scan, are extremely helpful in the diagnosis of high suspicion individuals based on symptoms and risk factors. The most common and relevant imaging findings are bilateral pneumonia and ground-glass opacifications. 19 The most frequent clinical laboratory findings are lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 20 Despite the flourish of COVID-19 studies, much remains to be understood regarding pathological findings. The first autopsies of COVID-19 related deaths showed typical features of lung diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), the histopathological image of acute respiratory distress syndrome, along with signs of exudative early-phase acute diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, intra-alveolar edema and thickened alveolar septa with perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. 21 In addition, the authors observed organizing-stage diffuse alveolar damage with marked fibroblastic proliferation, partial fibrosis, pneumocyte hyperplasia with interstitial thickening, collapsed alveoli and patchy lymphocyte infiltration. 21 In a few cases, thrombi were noted within small pulmonary artery branches. 22 Furthermore, in a few cases mild lymphocytic myocarditis, epicarditis and liver periportal fibrosis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was noted. 21 No viral inclusions were observed. 22 Significant viral related changes in other organs were not evident. 21 Further studies are needed to more accurately describe the myriad of pathological findings related with COVID-19 infection.",

            "text": "The incubation period for COVID-19 occurs within 14 days following exposure, with most cases displaying symptoms four to five days after exposure. 28 Remarkably, the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be more contagious during the first three days after symptoms onset, even though the spread is possible before symptoms appear and from symptomless people. 28 To prevent infection, health ruling bodies worldwide recommend frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others, in particular, people with symptoms, quarantine (especially for symptomatic patients), covering coughs and sneezes, keeping unwashed hands away from the face and using face masks. 29 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Human coronaviruses can remain infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days. 30 A recent pioneer study demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is able to remain viable in aerosols for at least 3 hours. 31 Regarding surface contamination, in the same study SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be more stable on plastic and stainless steel, with half-lives of 6,8 hours and 5,6 hours, respectively. 31 However, depending on the viral load, it could be detected up to 72 hours. 31 On copper, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was identified after 4 hours, whereas on cardboard, no viable virus was detected after 24 hours. 31 These results shed new lights on the aerosol and fomite transmission, providing relevant information to better tackle the viral spread. In fact, given that SARS-CoV-2 (similarly to SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and influenza virus) can survive on surfaces for extended periods of time, there is a need to perfect the cleaning and disinfection of surfaces to warrant effective infection prevention and control. The disinfectants with proven viricidal activity against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV include 0,1% sodium hypochlorite, 62% to 71% ethanol and 0,5% hydrogen peroxide after 1 minute of exposure. 30 Thus, it is expected that these agents are also effective against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the virus is inactivated by soap as it disrupts its lipid bilayer; and previous studies showed that several coronaviruses could be rendered non-infectious upon heat exposure, after 90 minutes at 56\u00b0C, 60 minutes at 67\u00b0C or 30 minutes at 75\u00b0C. 32 The histopathology protocols used in the surgical pathology laboratories are known to be effective in inactivating a broad range of viruses, including the Ebola virus. 33 Besides, formalin and glutaraldehyde were demonstrated to inactivate SARS-CoV-1 in a temperature-dependent and time-dependent manner and alcohol solutions with >62% alcohol are effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2. 30 As described above, heat can also be used to inactivate coronaviruses. 32 However, it remains elusive whether fixatives applied in the preparation of cytology specimens using lower alcoholic concentrations [for example, PreservCyt \u00ae and CytoLyt \u00ae (Hologic Inc., USA)] adequately inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 34 Therefore, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown and fundamental questions concerning which disinfectants are most effective against it remain unanswered. In addition, the appropriate fixation and processing methods in the context of COVID-19 for both histological and cytological samples remain to be firmly established.",

Cytological evaluations were performed only for essential cases, thereby limiting and reducing the number of routine cytology samples. Similarly, rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) procedures were discouraged and mostly halted.

The cytological material is processed in a dedicated BSC2 cabinet by a highly trained technician wearing adequate PPE [includes FFP2/N95/KN95 face mask, eye protection (goggles or face shield), disposable fluid-resistant nitrile gloves, a disposable water-repellent apron and coveralls with sleeves that fully cover the forearms, and shoe covers or dedicated shoes]. Regular change of gloves (every 30 minutes) is highly recommended. Surfaces, including the computer, computer keyboard, mouse and mouse pad, are disinfected at regular intervals during the day using 0,1% sodium hypochlorite or 70% ethanol solution depending on the surface type.",

            "text": "To enhance safety in the cytology laboratory, two novel protocols for cytology specimen preparation with improved sterilization were developed and compared with standard methods for bladder washing samples, peritoneal and pleural fluid specimens (Table I and Figure 1 ): one based on the usage of 70% ethanol and the other based on the usage of heat. Even though these methods of processing may alter the quality of the cytology sample when compared with samples processed using methanol-based fixatives, the modification of standard approaches for cytology sample preparation has the objective to improve laboratorial security in the COVID-19 context. In line with this, regarding the heat based protocol, we went further to determine the amount of time it takes for a 20 mL room temperature solution to heat up until 67\u00ba C inside the laboratory oven: it took nearly 45 minutes. Thus, to guarantee the period of one hour at 67\u00baC required to inactivate coronaviruses reported in the literature, 32 we started heat-sterilizing the cytology samples inside the laboratory oven for 1 hour and 45 minutes (TABLE I) . We did not observe overall significant morphological changes that precluded the pathologists from reaching a high quality diagnosis for the heat-based sterilization protocol (TABLE I and  Figure 1 ). Morphology with the 70% ethanol protocol was suboptimal (TABLE I and Figure 1 ) and thus, it shall not be a solid alternative choice to the standard processing protocol. These approaches, which can be of general interest to all the laboratories worldwide, need to be systematically assessed and further optimized before using in a large scale. It will be particularly important to determine their effectiveness in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation, using laboratory controlled experiments in adequate research facilities, which to the best of our knowledge do not exist in Portugal.",

The emergence of new pathogens such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a series of challenges to health services, especially during the initial phase of the struggle, when the knowledge on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f characteristics of the pathogen is still scarce and there is a lot of contradictory information. The current pandemic of COVID-19 emphasizes the importance of biological risk management in surgical pathology, reinforcing the critical need to adopt strict protocols and guidelines to establish and keep a safe work environment for health professionals, while ensuring maintenance of high quality standards of the diagnoses performed. The modification of established protocols may in some cases result in non-negligible changes in the morphological patterns commonly observed, while guaranteeing a higher level of laboratory biosafety for the healthcare professional working in a pandemic scenario and, on the other hand, also constitutes an opportunity to improve the protocols in use, helping to develop better solutions for the present and for the future, as we share in the current work. In line with this, it cannot be stressed enough that the processing and evaluation of human samples in scenarios with a high influx of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should be limited to essential cases for which the final diagnosis is likely to significantly alter patient management.",
