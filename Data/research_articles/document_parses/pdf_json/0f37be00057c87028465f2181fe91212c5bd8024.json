Proliferation policy is more complicated than superpower strategic weapons policy, since nuclear power supplies commercial energy to 30 nations, which could grow to 50. The START/SORT/ New-START and ABM treaties involve only two nations (United States and Russia) and they do not impact commercial energy supplies. In 2012, 30 nations produced 16 % of the world's electricity with nuclear power for a total capacity of 374 GW e . The United States had 101 GW e of nuclear power in 2012, producing 14 % of its electricity. The US load factor rose to 90 %, as the new fuels remain longer in reactors, giving less frequent shutdowns. Many nations depend heavily on nuclear energy; these include France (63 GW e , 78 % nuclear), Japan (44 GW e , 18 %), Russia (24 GW e , 17 %), South Korea (21 GW e , 35 %), Germany (18 GW e , 12 %), United Kingdom (10 GW e , 18 %), and Belgium (6 GW e , 54 %). Some of these states have their spent fuel reprocessed (France, UK, Japan, Belgium) in France, UK, and Russia, but the foreign contracts are coming to an end. Most countries plan to use deep burial, but with few specifics. Japan has almost completed its 800-tonne, Rokkasho reprocessing plant, capable of producing 8 Pu tonne/ year, while the Monju breeder reactor is shut down since 2010. Japan's fallback position is to use MOX fuel in at least 15 light water reactors, but much is uncertain after the Fukushima accident.

Luxembourg is next to go. Then who knows, maybe Monaco. We'll try to stay serene and calm When Alabama gets the Bomb. Who's Next? (Tom Lehrer, Reprise Records, 1965) Nuclear weapon programs usually grow out of dedicated national programs, rather than civil nuclear power programs. But there often is a connection between the peaceful and military fuel cycles that pass through reactors, making plutonium, or centrifuges that make highly enriched uranium (HEU). India, Pakistan, Israel, Iraq, Iran, and other countries used research programs to hide military programs. Proliferation watchers are rightly concerned when nations with small electrical power grids move toward nuclear power. If a nation risks destabilizing its small grid by connecting it to large nuclear power stations, there could be another reason. Similarly, small nations that plan to build an enrichment or reprocessing plant could establish a weapons program since it is not cost effective to enrich or reprocess on a small scale. As we discuss later, reactor-grade plutonium (RgPu) from civil power plants could be used, but in most cases these would be of a lesser quality. Still, reactorgrade Pu can be made into weapons of, perhaps, 0.5 kton, which is why commercial production and storage is monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). And nations that practice work with civil-use plutonium gain knowledge that will help in future weapon programs. Thus far, the eight nuclear weapon states with plutonium weapons have used only weapons-grade plutonium (WgPu) from dedicated, non-power reactors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 198, "text": "5.1.

Eisenhower claimed that nuclear fuel could be \"proliferation-proof\": \"The ingenuity of our scientists will provide special safe conditions under which such a bank of fissionable material can be made essentially immune to surprise seizure.\" Did Eisenhower mean plutonium would be immune to surprise attack because of excellent physical protection and safeguards? Or did he mean that ample amounts of the spontaneous neutron-emitter 240 Pu would prevent the use of plutonium in bombs? At that time, scientists incorrectly believed that 20 % 240 Pu gave enough early neutrons to preinitiate a chain reaction and greatly reduce the yield for all weapons designs. This belief has been proven false, but with qualifications. An interesting question to debate is whether actions subsequent to the Atoms for Peace speech reduced or increased global proliferation of nuclear weapons? I agree whole-heartedly with Len Weiss: \"Did the 50-year-old Atoms for Peace program accelerate nuclear weapons proliferation? The jury has been in for some time on this question, and the answer is yes. 2 \" There is no simple answer, to the broader question of \"was the Atoms for Peace program wise?\" This author takes a long-range point of view. Eisenhower did the right thing because his policies fostered the establishment of the IAEA in 1957 and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1970. Alone, the United States has never had the leverage to dictate its wishes to all nations. With all nations agreeing on a common framework of rules and inspections, the world can act in concert. Without the IAEA and NPT, which are the international nuclear regime, the world community would not have an effective way to exercise control over NNWS weapons programs and plutonium/uranium stockpiles.

The U.S. abandoned plutonium recycling with the 1978 cancellation of the breeder reactor and reprocessing. This course has been adopted by many other nations. r Reduction in excess weapons-grade materials. The United States and Russia agreed to each dispose of 34 tons of WgPu, as well as 500 tons of Russian and 174 tons of US HEU. r An assured supply of uranium. To reduce interest in recycling reactor fuel is for the U.S. to be an assured supplier of less-costly LEU. It is for this reason that the United States maintains control over reprocessing rights on spent fuel that has been enriched in the US or irradiated in US-supplied reactors. Uranium supplies have been helped by a dramatically slowed growth in nuclear power, increased uranium efficiency of reactors, and conversion of weapons-grade uranium of the Cold War into reactor fuel. r Fuel Bank. This was first proposed in the Eisenhower regime and continues to resurface as the world looks for difficult solutions. $150 million has been committed to help nations with their peaceful fuel supplies if they are threatened for other reasons. The existence of the fuel bank removes the main argument for a nation to want enrichment and reprocessing. r Nuclear suppliers group. The supplier nations agreed to constrain exports of sensitive nuclear fuel facilities (enrichment and reprocessing) and require that all the importer's nuclear facilities be under safeguards. r Export Criteria. The Indian bomb of 1974 created the climate for the passage of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1977, which requires safeguards on all nuclear facilities before exports are allowed. It also established criteria for U.S. when processing requests for reprocessing US-origin spent fuel by other nations. r Sanctions. When an NNWS moves toward the bomb, it will be denied nuclear power exports, military equipment, and other items of commerce. These enhanced sanctions were removed 2 years after the Indian and Pakistani 1998 nuclear tests. r Russian weapons usable materials. It is imperative that Russian warheads and weapons-grade nuclear materials remain under firm Russian accounting and control. The US Cooperative Threat Reduction programs have significantly improved this situation, but more needs to be done. r Spent fuel storage. The 35,000 tons of US-origin spent fuel at storage sites around the world do not have a final destination. The U.S. does not want to accept these materials nor does it want it reprocessed. Russia passed a law in 2001 that allows it to establish a large storage site, which could be a useful constraint on the plutonium in the event that it is not reprocessed. As of 2009, global spent fuel was distributed as follows: Canada (38,400 tonnes), Finland (1,600), France (13,500), Germany (5, 850) , Japan (19,000), Russia (13,000), South Korea (10,900), Sweden (5, 400) , UK (5, 850) , U.S. (61,000). r Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. France, Russia, UK and US have declared a halt to the production of HEU and Pu, primarily because they have much more than they need. The fifth nuclear weapon state, China, is believed to have halted production, and does not have large stocks of these materials. But its rivals, India and Pakistan, continue to produce these materials. A global ban on the production of weapons usable materials would lessen this regional proliferation concern. The IAEA Additional Protocol requires declarations on the production and stockpiling of these materials. It allows inspections to confirm their declarations. Brazil and Argentina have not signed the advanced protocol, but yet manage monitoring without it. FMCT verification is not yet agreed, but if did not include the monitoring of all existing P-5 weapons materials it would be less expensive. It would be very difficult to establish the IAEA base-line levels for these materials. The U.S. uses about 2 tons of HEU a year for its fleet, a conversion to 20 % enriched might be a requirement. If FMCT verification was constrained to new production it would be a manageable assignment. r Anti Ballistic Missiles: After $100 billion, missile defenses have faltered, but has the Israeli Iron Dome system changed the scene for tactical missiles? r Military Preemption. Case by case? Iran? r Vertical AND Horizontal Proliferation: Ratified CTBT and START treaties at 1,000 total warheads would lower the political reach of nuclear weapons and assist non-proliferation efforts. r Zero Nuclear Weapons. In the near-term, it would seem that ratifying the CTBT and going from 2,200, to 1,550, to 1,000 nuclear weapons would not diminish the ability to deter an attack on the U.S. All have admitted we don't know how to get to zero nuclear weapons in a stable, verifiable manner as we climb the mountain through the clouds.

The June 1981 Israeli destruction of Iraq's Osirak reactor was decried by most members of the UN and the IAEA since Iraq was a member \"in good standing.\" Today there is little hand wringing over the unilateral attack on Osirak, since it could have produced plutonium for Iraqi weapons. This preemptive attack rolled back proliferation (counterproliferation), and such attacks may become more likely. As with all policies, there are upsides and downsides. Preemptive rollbacks get the job done quickly, while international diplomats argue and postpone. But preemptive attacks shake the foundations of international processes and due process, unless international organizations are part of the process. An examination of motives for preemptive attacks points to inconsistencies, but these have to be balanced against the degree of threat from proliferation. The military has long defined threats in terms of both capabilities and intentions. Preemptive counterproliferation appears to be driven more by perceptions of the intentions of nations, since many states certainly have capabilities. The 2002 US National Security Strategy states it clearly: \"We will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by acting preemptively.\" But in soured relationships it is often difficult to separate worst-case interpretations from lesser interpretations. Ultimately, counterproliferation can lead to assassinations of leaders. This outcome is constrained by Presidential Executive Order 12333, which, nonetheless, can be quickly nullified without the approval of congress. One might ask if less stringent criteria for assassinations could rebound to put leaders in harm's way.

They are an extension of a diverse war on terror in faraway places for a nation with expensive troops and nation that is tired of war deaths. Drones are a response to save both American lives and money. Pilots sit at desks in Nevada or Djibouti, Gulf of Aden. The number of drone attacks peaked at 120/year in 2010, mostly in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. In Pakistan there were 296 drone strikes between 2004 and 2012, killing about 2,500 people, claimed to be mostly militants. Drones have the advantage that they can hover more than a day, tracking individual persons and their cars with visible and infrared cameras, or other sensors. When the time is right, the Predators launch Hellfire missiles to erase the target. By 2013 the U.S. had 6,000 drones, and is projected to spend $37 billion in the next decade. Some 50 nations seek drones, as well as local police and companies. The University of North Dakota has a degree program in unmade aerial systems. \"The sky is going to be dark with these things,\" says Chris Anderson, former editor of Wired. Sales have risen to 7,500 per quarter, with prices as low as $1,000, compared to renting a helicopter at $1,100/h. Current laws appear to have little protection against prying drones. The Federal Aviation Administration may require that they fly under 100 m altitude. Management of drones has shifted from the Pentagon to the CIA, as drones are more cloak and dagger, than traditional military. But in 2013 they return to the Pentagon.

The Golden Hawk is expected to replace the classic U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and the Orion submarine hunting aircraft.
