Enteric viruses commonly associated with these diarrheic syndromes include rotavirus, TAstV, enterovirus, reovirus, adenovirus, and TCV . Electron microscopy is the most commonly used method for detecting enteric viruses and is currently favored over molecular methods because it can potentially detect all enteric viruses in a single sample preparation, whereas several polymerase or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) may be needed to detect all enteric viruses. The molecular techniques, on the other hand, are sensitive and specific and can detect very small quantities of viral nucleic acids. We suspect that the true role of enteric viruses in PES is underestimated because of the relative insensitivity of EM.

It is possible that these viruses in combination may cause more increased adverse effects in poults than an individual virus. Such a possibility under field conditions cannot be ruled out based on our observations of detecting these viruses in combination from PES cases. In experimental studies, we have reported that oral inoculation of poults with PES material (positive for rotavirus, TAstV-2, and Salmonella) led to significant growth retardation for up to 50 d postinoculation. At no point postinoculation did any of the challenged birds' weight converge with that of controls (N. Jindal, unpublished data) .

The TAstV-2 assorted into 2 groups. In a previous study, the TAstV-2 also assorted into 2 groups based on polymerase phylogeny (N. Jindal, unpublished data).
