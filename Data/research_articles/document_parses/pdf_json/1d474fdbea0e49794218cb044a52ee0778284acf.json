A profound dose-dependent suppression of arthritis was noted (P < 0.001). The EDs0 was 80 _+ 14 /zmol/kg/day. The arthritis index correlated positively to the phagocytic production of oxygen radicals (r z > 0.672) and negatively to the concentration of allopurinol (r 2 = 0.915). Ex vivo, allopurinol and various conventional antirheumatic drugs were screened for the inhibition of 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated whole human blood chemiluminescence.

Therapeutic doses of NSAIDs, SAARDs, or steroids inhibited the phagocytic generation of reactive oxygen species by 10-50%.

In these patients the status of antioxidative sulfhydryls (SH) was significantly diminished and correlated inversely to the levels of XOD in serum. The intracellular SH status is crucially involved in the regulation of T-cell function (2) . Under physiological conditions xanthine oxidase is ubiquitously present in the form of a dehydrogenase (XDH), which uses NAD + as electron acceptor and degrades purines to uric acid (3) . Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) convert XDH to XOD, mainly by oxidizing structurally important sulfhydryls (4) . XOD now no longer uses NAD \u00a7 as an electron acceptor, but transfers electrons onto oxygen, thereby generating superoxide anion radicals (02 9 -), peroxides (O2-), hydroxyl radicals ('OH) and singlet oxygen (1AGO2) (5) . ROS are crucially involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and cause DNA strand breakage (6, 7) . DNA damage activates the chromatin-bound enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase. Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase promotes the repair of DNA by transferring the ADP-ribose part of NAD \u00a7 on to nuclear proteins. However, excessive activation of the enzyme depletes the intracellular NAD + pools and eventually causes cell death. The subsequent release of XOD into systemic circulation extends the intracellular oxidative stress to the extracellular space. The poly-ADPR-dependent \"suicide program\" has been associated with synovial hypertrophy and pannus formation in rheumatic patients (8) .",

            "text": "Reactive oxygen species are also known to regulate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) -dependent expression of proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and the expression of MHC class I and II genes (9) . Oxidative attack on the inhibiting subunit IKB of the cytosolic IKB/NF-KB complex causes its dissociation, and NF-~B travels into the nucleus, where it mediates gene transcription by interaction with its specific DNA recognition sites (10) . The subsequent expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-c~, IL-1, IL-3, IL-8, and GM-CSF prime the phagocytic NADPH oxidases to the 5-to 10-fold elevated production of ROS (11) . Similar to traditional second messengers like cAMP and inositolpolyphosphates, NF-KB does not require new protein synthesis (12) . The independence from de novo protein synthesis and the activation of NF-KB by reactive oxygen species embody an efficient autoregulatory loop for the rapid transduction of extracellular signals into specific patterns of gene expression in the nucleus. Due to the collapse of the antioxidant defense system in rheumatic patients (13) the dysregulated NF-rB-dependent gene expression may contribute to the onset and progression of rheumatic diseases. XOD, pathologically present in rheumatic serum, imbalances the ROS/NF-KB/cytokine network by the additional production of ROS. The leak of XOD into systemic circulation from oxidant-injured tissue was demonstrated first by Yokoyama et al. (14) . XOD was also monitored in the bloodstream of patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), extremity ischemia-reperfusion, and ischemia-reperfusion of the liver (15, 16) . An increased substrate level of hypoxanthine was found during hypovolemic traumatic shock (5) . Histamine, released from mast cells and basophils, during inflammatory processes, lowers the Km values for XODs substrates, thereby enhancing the activity of XOD (17) . In addition to its natural substrates, xanthine and hypoxanthine, XOD uses an array of other substrates, e.g., acetaldehyde originating from ethanol metabolism, gut bacteria, or various enzyme reactions. The oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid by XOD is accompanied by the generation of high energetic oxidants such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals (18) , which are known to rapidly degrade biopolymers like hyaluronic acid and collagen (1, 6) . Oxidants produced by XOD also activate inflammatory cells by ROS-derived chemoattractants formed from plasma compounds and increase the adhesiveness of the endothelium for those cells (17, 19) . At the same time, H202 induces platelet-activating factor (PAF) production by the endothelium. PAF causes adherence via the PAF receptor on leukocytes (20) . The oxidizing activity of PMNs induces the circulatory interruption in the capillaries, which again leads to ischemia and reperfusion. During ischemic reperfusion processes, the degradation of purine nucleotides is markedly affected, giving rise to enhanced levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine, thereby fueling the substrate pools for XOD (15) .",

Male DBA/lxB10A(4r) mice, weighing 25-30 g, were kept under specified pathogen-free (SPF) conditions on a standard laboratory diet ad libitum and a 12-h light/dark cycle. On day zero, 120 DBA/IxB10(4r) mice each were anesthetized with diethylether and 3 #mol/kg K3CrO 8 administered topically by intraplantar application into the left hindpaws. The animals were then subdivided randomly into groups of 20. Allopurinol was dissolved in a minimal volume of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). One hour after the induction of arthritis, 20 mice each received allopurinol by intraperitoneal application at the concentrations stated in the legends to the figures. Ten mice received either PBS or PBS plus DMSO at the highest concentration, which was required to dissolve allopurinol. This dose of DMSO did not detectably affect the arthritis. The intraperitoneal injections of aUopurinol or PBS were repeated daily and the arthritis index determined by an experimenter, who was unaware of the experimental design. The arthritis index is a grading system routinely used to assess the arthritis (21): 0, normal paws; 1, erythema of toes; 2, erythema and swelling of paws; 3, swelling of ankles; 4, complete swelling of the whole leg and inability to bend it. The maximum achievable score is 16. The time versus arthritis index curves were recorded for 20 days and integrated.",

The acute CL response then declined progressively until day 6. A secondary response followed, which peaked on day 12. The CL curve stayed at high levels until day 17 and then began to wane slowly. This secondary CL response correlated with the development of arthritis in noninjected paws. A dose-dependent reduction of CL was monitored in allopurinol treated animals ( Figure 6 ). Doses of 300, 100, and 10/xmol/kg/day of allopurinol caused 70, 40, and 20% reductions respectively, of CL (P < 0.001). No significant reduction was obtained with 1 /zmol/kg/day of allopurinol. The concentration of allopurinol required to inhibit the CL response by 50% was calculated graphically as 1 l0 #mol/kg/day, resembling the daily dose needed to inhibit the arthritis index by 50% (80/zmol/kg/day; Figure 4) . Interestingly, the secondary CL response of the disease controls ( Figure 5 ; days 7-12) was almost completely suppressed in the presence of 300/xmol/kg/day of allopurinol and dose-dependently inhibited by 1-100 #mol/kg/day of allopurinol. Similar to the murine model of arthritis induced with Freund's complete adjuvant, where a swelling of noninjected hindpaws appears at days 9-12 (26) , the secondary increase of CL in PIA mice may reflect an immunological response of proliferating lymphocytes, which have been shown to generate superoxide (27) . Comparable to immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, this immunological response is blocked by allopurinol through the inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis (28) .",

Low doses of allopurinol combined with mercaptopurine or azathioprin are also effective in antitumor therapy (25) . Unlike conventional antirheumatic therapy with NSAIDs and SAARDs, which is often complicated by loss of effectiveness and severe side effects, daily doses of 100-900 mg allopurinol are well tolerated in most patients (25) . The suppression of both lymphocytic and phagocytic responses combined with its immunosuppressive and XOD-inhibiting activity make allopurinol a promising candidate for the basic therapy of inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Our results add to the recent findings of Chocair et al. (29) , which report a > 90 % reduced occurrence of rejection episodes in patients with renal transplantation treated with allopurinol plus conventional immunosuppressive therapy. Interestingly, the withdrawal of allopurinol from patients with tophaceous gout was reported to cause acute attacks of arthritis in 81% of patients (30) . Recently, allopurinol was also shown to form stoichiometrical complexes with copper(II) (31). These Cu(II)-allopurinol complexes decreased markedly the oxyradical-induced DNA breakage. As the copper concentrations in plasma of rheumatic patients are commonly elevated by up to 300% (32), in vivo formation of Cu(II)-allopurinol can be responsible for the inhibition of NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production by mimicking superoxide dismutase-like activity (33) .",
