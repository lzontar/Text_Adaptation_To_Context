With the increment in COVID-19 incidence, more is being learned about which individuals and groups experience the most complications. Researchers have emphasized that older age, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, concomitant cardiovascular diseases (including coronary artery disease and heart failure), and myocardial injury are significant risk factors associated with worse outcomes [2] . With these factors set in mind, we must acknowledge that racial/ethnic minority populations have a disproportionate burden of underlying comorbidities like diabetes, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease [3] .",
