The source was thought to be a wet market called the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Subsequently, it was determined that the agent responsible was an enveloped RNA beta coronavirus, designated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, or 2019-nCoV) (1) (Fig. 1) . The condition associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was named COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) , and it was designated a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 . Genomic characterization of the virus determined that the agent was distinct from other coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) (2) . SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious. As of May 3, 2020, there were 3.6 million documented cases globally with, 248,000 deaths, resulting in a case fatality rate of 6.9%. However, these numbers are likely to be inaccurate since asymptomatic infections occur and the rate of testing in different countries range from a low of 4 people tested out of 1 million population in Yemen to 146,000 tested out of 1 million population in Iceland (3) . Patients with cancer are at a heightened risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19 (4, 5) . As a group, they tend to be older and have an increased risk of relative immunosuppression from the underlying malignancy and from anti-cancer treatments. Furthermore, patients with lung cancer may have additional comorbidities, including a history of smoking and pre-existing lung disease. There are challenges in the management of a patient with lung cancer given similarities in radiologic findings, respiratory symptoms and presence of underlying immunosuppression. In addition, immune checkpoint inhibitors are now widely used in the management of advanced lung cancer. Immune related pneumonitis from these agents could mimic COVD-19 radiologically. In this article, we aim to provide guidance in the management of lung cancer patients during this period through a multi-disciplinary perspective, based on clinical experience and the available data in the literature.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 469, "end": 484, "text": "2019 (COVID-19)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 562, "end": 576, "text": "March 11, 2020", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 743, "end": 746, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1182, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "(4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1288, "text": "5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 385, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "According to the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the preferred current diagnostic method is the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in patient specimens (6, 7) .

Viral load is more similar to influenza and it does not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (17) . Like SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to use the ACE2 receptor to enter host cells (18) . ACE2 is highly expressed on cells in blood vessels, the heart, the kidney and AT2 cells in the lungs. The latter are important for the synthesis, storage and secretion of surfactant, a substance that prevents atelectasis of lung tissue by lowering surface tension of alveoli. The destruction of AT2 cells may play a key role in the development of severe pulmonary symptoms in patients with COVID-19.

To protect trial participants, policy and procedures are being revised to manage study conduct in compliance with control of Covid-19 with appropriate protocol amendments approved by the Institutional Review Boards and sponsors. Specific recommendations and considerations for different stages of lung cancer are discussed below and outlined in Tables 3-5.Early Stage Lung CancerFor patients with stage I/II and resectable stage III NSCLC, treatment is either surgical resection or ablative radiotherapy strategies. The surgical principles of lung cancer remain the same during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the logistics of clinical practice for early stage lung cancer may be modified. If the COVID-19 outbreak is impending, an important issue is to decide whether to delay surgery or not. Guidance from CDC and most professional societies indicates that elective surgeries should be rescheduled if possible(51). The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommended that clinicians and patients need to make individual determinations based on the potential harms of delaying needed cancerrelated surgery(52). It has been suggested that in patients with a recent diagnoses of early-stage lung cancer or those with suspicious pulmonary nodules, it is advisable to reschedule surgery as undergoing surgery during the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in a dismal outcome(53). College of Surgeons (ACS) has recently published COVID-19 elective case triage guidelines for surgical care focusing on the hospital resources available depending on the phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (55). In phase I, a semi-urgent setting, they recommended surgery restricted to patients likely to have survivorship compromised if surgery is not performed within the next three months. For lung cancer, such cases include solid or predominantly solid (>50%) lung cancer or presumed lung cancer > 2cm, or node-positive lung cancers. It is also recommended that patients who finished induction therapy proceed to surgery. Predominantly ground glass nodules, solid nodules < 2cm, or indolent histology should be deferred.In phase II, an urgent setting, surgery is restricted to patients likely to have survival compromised if surgery is not performed within the next few days, such as tumorassociated infection or surgical complications. Alternative treatment options, including transferring patients to a hospital that is in phase I, neoadjuvant therapy, or stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), are recommended.If a SARS-CoV-2 test is positive, surgery should be delayed for 2-3 weeks if possible. If the patient's condition is urgent, it is recommended that surgery proceed in a specialized negative-pressure operating room with full personal protection equipment and postoperative care in a negative-pressure isolation room. All patients should be retested for SARS-CoV-2 when delayed surgery is rescheduled.As a specific example, in the setting of a widespread outbreak throughout the whole region, as experienced in Lombardy, Italy(26), an approach based on the stage of the disease and other oncologic clinical evaluations was implemented. Lung cancer patients were categorized into two groups: 1) red code, those with stage IC, II or III disease with a real risk of progression and patients who already received induction chemo-or chemo-radiation treatment, for which surgery should be guaranteed in 4 weeks; 2) yellow code, those patients with stage I tumor (< 2cm) or indolent malignancies that can be postponed for 1 or 2 months. The Lombardy region identified and selected several hospital hubs that should theoretically be 'COVID free' for oncology cases. Surgical 'red code' cases from other hospitals, were diverted to those hub hospitals.In patients with resectable locally advanced disease with a single positive mediastinal station (resectable non bulky IIIA) or T3N1 tumors for which surgical treatment is scheduled after induction therapy(56), the timing of surgery could be planned such that adjuvant chemotherapy starts at a later date. This approach is based on two main reasons; 1) to avoid exposing the patient to the risk of infection during the frequent trips to and from the hospital for chemotherapy cycles at the apex of the COVID-19 emergency period; 2) to reduce chemotherapy induced immunosuppression which can expose the patient to an increased risk of COVID -19 and, in case of infection, to serious pulmonary complications with a delay of potential curative surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapy is recommended in appropriate patients to mitigate any deleterious effects from postponing surgery in situations where surgical services are overwhelmed. In general, measures that allow home management of cancer patients are encouraged, including telemedicine and phone calls replacing physical visits (57). Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a well-established non-invasive method of treating early stage (<5 cm) nodenegative NSCLC. Treatment with SBRT results in highly effective cure and local control rates with minimal risk. The delivery of SBRT can involve treatment with 50-70 Gy in as many as 5-10 fractions for central tumors but can be delivered in a single fraction of 24-34 Gy for peripheral tumors <2 cm (58). For patients where SBRT is appropriate, careful consideration should be given to whether treatment should be delivered immediately or delayed for small slow growing tumors. Wherever possible, SBRT fractionation schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic should be shortened as much as possible with maximal use of single fraction treatment. Brachytherapy is another modality for radiotherapy primarily of early stage, recurrent, or small endobronchial obstructive lesions involving insertion of a radioactive source to treat small areas with less deposition of radiation dose to surrounding tissues. However, brachytherapy requires multidisciplinary coordination in a protected operating room or brachytherapy suite, patient sedation, bronchoscopy, and planning that increases risk of exposure to patients and providers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is suggested to consider avoiding all brachytherapy procedures if there are any external beam radiotherapy or alternative options. Adjuvant therapy is not recommended for stage I NSCLC patients. In cases where local conditions render systemic chemotherapy hazardous resulting in the inability to start adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy, adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy could be considered for resected EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC (59, 60).If patients are clinically stable post adjuvant therapy, follow-up imaging can be delayed for 3-4 months", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "given to the institution of adjuvant therapy, particularly in frail patients. The start of treatment after surgery should be delayed for as long as possible consistent with the adjuvant chemotherapy data (up to 12 weeks post surgery). Systemic therapies associated with a reduced risk of myelosuppression, shorter treatment time and lower frequency of treatment visits are recommended. A three weekly schedule such as cisplatin/ pemetrexed (66) may be reasonable, although one limitation is its longer infusion time. In contrast, therapies with frequent visits such a daily (67) or weekly schedules should be avoided. Paclitaxel should also be avoided if possible, given the need for relatively high doses of steroids as a premedication as well as the longer infusion time. Because of a shorter infusion time and steroid-sparing properties, nab-paclitaxel may be a preferred alternative to paclitaxel, if it is available. The use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)should be strongly encouraged as prophylaxis or early secondary prevention of neutropenia as appropriate.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "L1 or PD-L2 leads to inhibition of an ongoing or starting immune response. PD-1 determines the threshold, the strength and duration of an immune response, and is sometimes called the immune \"rheostat\". Blocking PD-1 by monoclonal antibodies has resulted in anticancer efficacy. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are currently approved for many cancer types as a new standard of care, including 1st line and 2nd line treatment of NSCLC and 1st line treatment of SCLC (73). During an acute viral infection, CD8 T cells upregulate cell surface PD-1. Blockade of PD-1 at this stage results in accelerated viral clearance (74, 75). Depending on the type of virus, this may be accompanied by more severe inflammation of the infected tissue. Following viral clearance, the expanded virus specific T cell population contracts and T cell memory is formed. One type of T cell memory cells, so-called tissue resident memory T cells, permanently populate the infected tissue, such as lung tissue during virus infections of lower airways (76). At this stage, expression of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1/2 may prevent further tissue damage, whereas blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis could result in immunopathology. Also, PD-L1 expression especially may be differentially regulated during an acute viral infection. PD-L1 is much more widely expressed compared to PD-1. Apart from cells belonging to the hematopoietic lineages, endothelial and parenchymal cells can also upregulate PD-L1 (77). Upon an acute viral infection, in addition to PD-1 expression by CD8 and CD4 T cells, PD-L1 is also upregulated by cytokines, especially IFN type 1 and IFN\u03b3, and by pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLR and others, depending on the type of virus. Expression of PD-L1 by virus-infected cells may inhibit T cells from efficiently eliminating these cells. In other models of acute viral infection, the PD-L1 expression occurring later during an acute infection could limit tissue damage by controlling PD-1 expressing virus-specific T cells (77). Hence, ideally, an immune response proceeds in such a way that viral clearance is optimal with as little tissue damage as possible [reviewed in (78)]. What would be the effect of blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis during an acute viral infection, such as COVID-19? Could this lead to a better or worse outcome? To even more tissue damage?
