            "text": "We declare no competing interests. Robust data acquisition on the effect of emergent pathogens on pregnancy is often absent, and often data are available after considerable delay, 3 leaving scientists and clinicians seeking knowledge to depend solely on intuition, extrapolation, and case series as they emerge. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic is no exception. 1,4-8 Large cohorts are required to allow for accurate risk estimates, and therefore a global perspective is needed. To scientists and clinicians involved in the care of pregnant patients during a pandemic, this situation feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, given the many similarities to the Zika virus epidemic only 5 years ago. 3 To tweak resources, we have adjusted the Zika virus international web registry 9 to create COVI-Preg, a structured data collection tool available to any facility assessing pregnant patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Today, with increased mobility and considerable migration, we have to use the modern tool of worldwide and immediate communication to trigger knowledge sharing and prepare for rapid assessment of existing and future emergent pathogens. This registry and its associated international network will be organised to be rapidly adaptable to any other emerging infectious agent in the future. The feasibility of this global responsive and customisable structure for future emergent pathogens is supported by the strong platform of well established collaborations with 198 antenatal clinics from 23 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and the Americas (figure). This structure will allow for the creation of a large dataset capturing global information in an attainable and realistic manner, with affordable costs and an acceptable timeframe.",
