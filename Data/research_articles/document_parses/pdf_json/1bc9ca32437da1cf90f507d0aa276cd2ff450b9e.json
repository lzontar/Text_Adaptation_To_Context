Of course, pathological findings found through these techniques cannot be specific to the type of virus causing the pathology. Covid-19 is a type of viral pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and has many things in common with other types of viral pneumonia and infections such as influenza, H1N1, SARS or MERS. Therefore, strictly speaking, by using only the image without any other clinical information of the patient, these methods cannot confirm whether a patient is infected by covid-19. They can only detect whether the patient has a viral pneumonia. But since during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic most viral pneumonia is caused by SARS-COV-2, detecting these cases quickly in an automated manner can be beneficial. The information provided by the AI methods could be combined with all the other information regarding the patient (clinical history, symptoms, closeness to other covid-19 cases, etc.) to reach a more informed decision 31 .",

Finally, to have more healthy images, we added a random subset of ChestX-ray8 56 dataset (10,000 random healthy lung images). In all cases only Anterior-Posterior or Posterior-Anterior views were used, discarding all lateral images. In the case of covid-19 suspicious patients, we only retained those with a confirmed positive PCR record in the two weeks prior to the image acquisition date. Table 1 shows the number of patients and X-Ray images from each. A total of 9,841 patients were included in the study, with a covid-19 prevalence of 17.6% (1,733/9,841) and a Tuberculosis prevalence of 8.2% (810/9,841). In average each patient had 2.03 X-Ray images available, for a total of 20,024 images. Demographical information such as age, gender, etc. was not used in this study. The reasons are three-fold: 1) this data was available only from a handful of patients, 2) To avoid overfitting due to dangerous data correlations and 3) to test the power of AI image analysis on its own. Images from these sources were already provided after a pre-processing done by the dataset authors: clinical image headers were removed for anonymization, and images converted to either as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) or Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) images. The exception was COVIDDSL 49 , which was provided using original Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format images. These images were automatically processed in a similar fashion to the other datasets, removing the image header and converting them to PNG format after adequate conversion to 8-bits. Figure 1 Power sampling 57 was used to establish the N necessary to validate a model with at least 90% detection rate considering the prevalence of the data (17.6%) and error rates of type I below 5% and type II below 10%. The result was N=548. Although this condition could have been met using only 5% of the data for testing, we performed a 66%/33% training/test split for fairness and to have a large test set. Therefore, 3,528 patients were used for testing and the remaining (6,313) for training. Resulting prevalences on the test set were 23.3% (823/3,528) for covid-19 and 7.6% (269/3,528) for Tuberculosis.",

We have performed the study combining patients from several sources, each of which was in turn constructed using patients from different centers. This means that the data used is inherently multi-center and multiple equipment and operators were responsible for the acquisition of the images, giving more credibility to the results. Furthermore, we have carefully separated patients to train and test methods, and established the number of test patients using power sampling. This resulted in \"fair\" train/test splits and moderated sized test sets. Moreover, we evaluated methods simulating a real application, where if several images are acquired for each patient all of them are incorporated into the analysis. Another strength worth noting is that we used all data available (as long as clinical outcome was confirmed through a positive PCR), refraining from manual filtering of images and/or patients based on dubious quality criteria that cannot be checked by a third party for correctness. We tested both CT scans and X-Ray images with a common methodology, to establish virtues and defects of each for covid-19 detection. Finally, for the first time, we demonstrated that AI methods seem to be able to distinguish between viral infections and bacterial infections (covid-19 vs tuberculosis).",

Another limitation is the varying prevalence regarding covid-19 patients found in the datasets used, which undoubtedly difficult a direct comparison of results. Finally, all covid-19 patients evaluated were patients showing symptoms and had lungs affected; it is unclear whether the methods evaluated could be used to detect asymptomatic patients.
