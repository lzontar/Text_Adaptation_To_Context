Bone is the most common first site of metastatic disease accounting for 40% of all first recurrence and 70% of patients with advanced disease develop skeletal involvement. Treatment of bone metastases currently focusses on symptom relief and prevention and treatment of skeletal complications. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects. Methods/design: CARBON is a UK-based, open-label, multi-centre study which comprises an initial safety phase to establish the feasibility and safety of combining radium-223 given on a 6-weekly schedule in combination with orally administered capecitabine followed by a randomised extension phase to further characterise the safety profile and provide preliminary estimation of efficacy.",

Metastatic tumour development is thought to follow complex interactions between the tumour cell and the bone microenvironment allowing occupation of the haematopoietic stem cell and other cellular niches in the bone marrow by tumour cells. Tumour-derived factors attract and stimulate osteoclasts, increasing bone turnover and releasing bone-activated growth factors and cytokines [1] The skeletal lesions seen in association with breast cancer are most commonly osteolytic and associated with significant morbidity due to the skeletal complications, termed skeletal-related events (SREs): severe bone pain requiring radiation, pathological fracture, spinal cord or nerve root compression, hypercalcaemia and the requirement of surgery or radiation to bone. However, there is usually an osteoblastic component that is manifested by the visualisation of bone metastases on radionuclide bone scans and elevation of osteoblastic bone markers such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP). Although sometimes identified on imaging tests, most SREs are associated with symptoms when they are known as symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs). The median survival time after the development of bone metastases is approximately 2-3 years.",

            "text": "Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223) is a novel alphaemitting pharmaceutical that has been developed for the treatment of bone metastases. The product is based on the alpha-emitting radionuclide radium-223. The intrinsic bone-targeting property of radium-223 compounds is similar to that of other alkaline earth elements, like calcium. The characteristics of alpha-emitting radionuclides have benefits over beta-emitting radionuclides for bone targeting. Firstly, radium-223 emits alpha-particles with high linear-energy transfer and a radiation range limited to less than 100 \u03bcm [8] [9] [10] [11] . This generates a highly localised and effective radiation zone with high probability of inducing double-strand DNA breaks in the cancer cells. LOn the other hand, beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals, such as strontium, emit particles with lower energy, mainly inducing single-strand breaks which are more easily repaired. Additionally, beta-particles typically have 30-80 times longer radiation range compared to alpha-particles. An alpha-emitting radiation source located in a target tissue, such as bone metastases, will deliver higher energy radiation to a more localised volume than beta emitters, thereby reducing exposure of surrounding normal tissues and leading to less toxicity, importantly less myelotoxicity. Radium-223 received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2013 for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and bone metastases [12] .",

Currently, larger randomised trials are evaluating the addition of radium-223 to an aromatase inhibitor alone or with everolimus (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02258451 and NCT02258464). The results are anticipated in 2020. Combinations with chemotherapy are also of interest for treatment later in the clinical course. Capecitabine was selected due to its frequent use as a single agent in breast cancer and relative lack of myelotoxicity. The combination may, therefore, target both bone metastases and visceral metastases.",
