Red dots are real data; red lines are the forecasted daily deaths with the associated bands of uncertainty (CL 95%).According with these predictions, some important consequences in easing the locking of a big number of the confined population are extracted.First of all, the number of diagnosed infected people will increase with time continuously during the rest of the month of April and the whole month of May. In fact, if there are no changes in the ease of the confinement or in the statistical methodologies of counting infected or deaths, there will be a peak in the daily rate of infected by the 28 th of May and a peak in the daily rate of deaths by the 1 st of June. The total number of deaths in Spain by that date will reach the 46,000 \u00b1 15,000.Of course, these predictions do not consider important changes, as a sudden increase in the temperatures which would hopefully reduce the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2, or the discovery of a vaccine -which seems extremely difficult in a so reduced period of time. During this time possibly the treatment of hospitalized patients will improve and therefore a smaller fraction of them would need intensive care with ventilators.And, as mentioned, all of these predictions lose their validity if there are changes in the situation, as additional people leaving the confinement, relaxation of the use of personal countermeasures (gloves, masks), etc.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF11": {"text": "-Map of Spain showing the level of infection at each region forecasted with the model described in this paper. This result has an important use for the authorities, as the population which have a high level of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 have probably developed immunity against the virus (at least temporarily as discussed before), and therefore there is no chance for them to be infected again in the future. And on the contrary, there is a bigger chance of being infected in those regions where the percentage of the infected population is smaller. The model provides counterintuitive results in this case. As observed, the capital, Madrid, presents a medium level of infection of the population, whereas Catalonia shows a high level. In fact both, the number of diagnosed cases and deaths in Madrid was higher at the time of writing this paper, what would imply a higher level of infection in Madrid. However this could be explained in the different criteria applied in different regions. For example Catalonia decided to include in the statistics the deaths of people occurred in their homes and not only in the hospitals, while it was unknown if", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF12": {"text": "a prediction of the percentage of the population infected in the different regions of Spain was performed by using the suggested semiempirical model. These predictions have been shown in a map of Spain showing those regions where the infection level was low, medium or high. Some results obtained with this methodology were not intuitive according with the official information. The more counterintuitive result probably being the higher level of infection of Catalonia compared with Madrid region. This result can be only validated by the use of massive testing in the whole Spanish territory.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "-Values obtained by fitting equation 2 to the experimental data in different regions or countries. *Data used for the fitting from worldometer 4 . **Data used for the fitting from the Spanish official source of information 5 . For the parameters H and C empirical averaged values from the studied region were used. Also for the CFR empirical averaged values were used, as the initial value taken from China was well overpassed in many European countries, although with the time it is expected to tend to the same equilibrium value observed at China. In Spain for instance, the values obtained the 6 th of April were H = 0.467 and C = 0.1497, whatindicates that an elevated rate of diagnosed cases needed to be hospitalized, or more probably that only severe cases were diagnosed at the hospitals needing about half of them to be hospitalized. Also a high percentage of the patients at the hospital (almost a 15%) needed at some time to receive intensive care using ventilators, what was in agreement with the observed pattern at China and other countries. In this case H\u22c5C = 0.07 (7%) which is within the initial range observed for the patients needing an ICU. As all parameters are dynamically calculated every day, the predictions can be slightly altered by the new data provided by the sources of information.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Brauer, F.
