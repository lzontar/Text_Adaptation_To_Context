Historic models project that 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients will need rehabilitation following their illness, and 20% more will need in-home care. [1] These numbers likely represent hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide, and may underestimate the actual need because of the increased risk of functional decline seen in high-risk groups such as older patients and patients with pre-existing co-morbidities. Additionally, COVID-19 has been associated with significant cardiopulmonary impairment including arrhythmia, myocardial injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [2] and numerous potential neurologic deficits, including ataxia, encephalopathy, myopathy, and cerebral vascular accidents, with more severe cases carrying an increased risk of neurologic injury. [3] Providing sufficient rehabilitation care is a particular challenge for regions with high per-capita infections that have to rely on temporary field hospitals to supplement over-capacity hospitals. Unfortunately, there exists no framework for distributing rehabilitation care in field hospitals during a pandemic, and traditional models for disaster care focus on triaging patients after traumatic events (natural disaster, warzone). [4] Field hospitals are designed to maximize bed capacity and likely do not allocate space solely for rehabilitation; providers must therefore think of innovative ways to deliver care in this atypical setting. In the case of the authors' field hospital, original plans were for one physical therapist per 100 patients until members of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation became involved in facility planning.",

This includes reviewing how many patient scores indicated high rehabilitation needs, and if those patients ended up receiving therapy. Patients who continued to receive therapy during their stay at the field hospital would be considered to have actually needing rehabilitation because a physical therapist or physiatrist would have evaluated the patient and continued (or discontinued) therapies based on the patient's clinical presentation. Additionally, the RCovR tool will be evaluated from a feasibility standpoint, as the providers who screen patients with this tool will be asked to evaluate its effectiveness and ease of use. The number of times the tool was used compared to the number of patients admitted to the field hospital will also be recorded, since if the tool is arduous to use or perceived to be inaccurate, triage personnel may stop using it.

It also takes into account cognition, as deficits may be a sign of neurologic damage from the disease (and therefore rehabilitation is indicated). Of course, patients with impaired cognition may have delirium without a brain injury and still benefit from field hospital rehabilitation. In addition to adding exercise to their field hospital care, skilled therapy and/or physiatric evaluation allows for routine re-assessments of their cognitive status, which may improve during their stay at the field hospital. Regardless of the degree of cognitive impairment, these patients will likely benefit from seeing a physiatrist and/or other rehabilitation team members as an outpatient once discharged.
