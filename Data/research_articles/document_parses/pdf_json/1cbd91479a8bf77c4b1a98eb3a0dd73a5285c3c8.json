The recombinant FIPV-UU4 S protein was overexpressed in a human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell line. With 1,391 amino acids in its sequence, the expected molecular mass of the homotrimeric recombinant protein is 465 kDa. Nevertheless, size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle static light scattering (SEC-MALS) indicated an apparent molecular mass of 722 kDa for the single elution peak, of which 192 kDa (27% of the total molecular mass) was ascribed to glycan moieties (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A ). The extensive glycosylation and the trimeric state were confirmed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing and native conditions, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B) . Importantly, immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrated that mouse anti-FIPV-UU4 S protein serum was able to differentiate serotype I-and II-infected cells, thus establishing the potential of FIPV-UU4 S protein as a potent vaccine candidate for FIP treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D). Using a 200-keV electron microscope, we determined the 3D electron density map of the FIPV-UU4 S protein to 3.3-\u00c5 resolution, which revealed a propeller-like homotrimer structure with an overall dimension of 180 \u00c5 in diameter and 170 \u00c5 in height (Fig. 1A , Table 1 , SI Appendix, Figs.

Detailed inspection of the EM map showed well-defined sidechain densities in most regions, including the interstrand disulfide bonds, attesting to the high quality of our EM-derived structural model (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D and Movie S2). After considering the electron densities of individual amino acids, many electron densities remained unaccounted for. It transpired that these additional densities correspond to the N-glycan structures (vide infra).

According to the sequence, 37 N-linked glycosylation sites are predicted for FIPV-UU4 S protein. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the de-Nglycosylated tryptic peptides led to identification of 29 occupied N-glycosites based on the conversion of Asn to Asp upon PNGase F treatment ( Fig. 2A) . The remaining 8 predicted N-glycosylation sites, namely 27 NTSH, 31 NNSK, 482 NYTD, 585 NGSV, and 590 NVTS in the S1 subunit, 1308 NTTH in the S2 subunit, and 1352 NQTK and 1357 NLTA in HR2, were not verified due to the lack of corresponding tryptic peptides.

Taking the average size of these 2 predominant N-glycan structures-1,768 Da for biantennary and 1,864 Da for M9-that were released from the FIPV-UU4 S protein, a total of 37 glycosylated sites would contribute to a total of 66.6 kDa of glycan per monomer, namely ca. 200 kDa for a trimer, consistent with the 192-kDa glycan contribution as inferred from SEC-MALS data (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A ).

Through different image-processing procedures, we could unambiguously build 28 N-linked glycan structures onto the atomic model, including 2 N-glycosylation sites, N585 and N590, which were not identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of the de-N-glycosylated peptides (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ).

This brings the total of MS-verified N-glycosylation to 31 out of the predicted 37 sites (summarized in Fig. 2A ). For each of the identified sites, the most abundant and hence most representative glycoforms were deduced from the relative peak intensities of the manually extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) of the corresponding glycopeptides (SI Appendix, Table S2 ). For example, the XICs of glycopeptides derived from N1218 and N949 indicated that the major glycoforms correspond to an M9 high mannose and a nonsialylated, fucosylated biantennary complex-type glycan structure, respectively ( Fig. 2 C and E, Left) . Close examination of the EM density protruding from the side chain of N949 revealed additional density next to the first GlcNAc moiety linked to N949.

The most significant structural difference is the unique 3-blade propeller-like structure formed by the S1 subunit. The combined efforts of cryo-EM and MS analyses identified and delineated the positions and structures of 33 out of the 37 predicted N-glycosylation sites, accounting for 27% of the total molecular mass. Our results represent the unprecedentedly detailed analysis of the N-linked glycans of a CoV S protein in terms of their chemical compositions and 3D structures, made possible through the use of a mammalian expression system to introduce physiological mammalian glycosylation patterns. The resulting models revealed some spatial partitioning of high-mannose versus complex-type glycans. Several high-mannose-type glycans are located at the junctions between domains and appear to serve as wedges to maintain the domain architecture (Fig. 2B) . It is plausible that the protein domain junctions generate significant steric hindrance, thereby preventing subsequent trimming and addition of the complextype glycan structures (32) . In addition to protein folding, viral protein glycosylation plays a pivotal role in viral infection. Glycosylation of virus envelope proteins helps shield their antibody-neutralizing epitopes as a way to evade host immunity. One of the best-known examples is the envelope glycoprotein (gp120) of HIV-1, of which glycosylation accounts for almost half of its molecular mass and plays an essential role in host immunity evasion (33) . In CoVs, a recent study on HCoV-NL63 suggests that the glycosylation at N358 within its RBMs may serve as molecular trickery for evading host immunity (19) . However, the role of the absent glycan shield at the corresponding putative RBMs in FIPV-UU4 S protein should be further investigated. In addition to their protective roles in shielding viruses from being neutralized by host immune systems, spike-protein glycosylation can be selectively recognized by host cells to facilitate viral infections. Lectin-dependent enhancements of viral infections have been reported for SARS-CoV (34), Ebola virus (35, 36) , Marburg virus (34) , and Dengue virus (37) . Both serotype I and serotype II FIPVs use feline dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (fDC-SIGN) as a coreceptor to recognize high-mannose glycans during viral entry and transmission (34) .
