At the time of writing, the Government response has involved three core components. One has been more and more regulated spatial stilling through a range of measures, including voluntary and then forced two-week quarantine of travellers; closure of venues/businesses that gather people, including schools and universities; the recommendation or instruction to work from home and to stay at home; discouragement of socializing, meeting, or acting in groups; and restrictions of more than 2 people congregating in public spaces.",

An interesting aspect of the Government's response has been its constituting of a national cabinet made up of members from both major parties to guide its policy decisions.",

The differential effects on people in Melbourne of the Government's initiatives to contain the virus were seen immediately in the losing of work by up to a million people (particularly in hospitality, tourism, retail, the arts), compared to increased duties for people employed in 'essential' services, and work at home for more privileged employees. Melbourne inhabitants' diverse existential experiences of the pandemic were keenly related to these processes.",

Responding to such a mood, the Government legislated policy that funded businesses to pay stood down workers, as well as doubling the unemployment benefit. The policy produced highly uneven outcomes, determined by the degree of existing exploitation in the myriad arrangements concerning casual workers, including the 'legality' of their employment; whether workers were citizens or non-citizens (temporary visa holders); and whether workers qualified for the one-year employment duration (in one company) that guaranteed the business a replacement wage to be bestowed upon a worker. Many casual workers did not.",

Certain fragile realities of existence emerged that usually were made hard to hear by the din of discourses and ideologies defending capitalists' interests. Precarity was displayed in the sudden queues of people lined up to enrol for the 'dole', which for many people enlivened social memories of earlier depressions.",

Here appeared a baffling 'leftist' blindness to the terrible course of the pandemic in Italy, Spain, the U.K., and the USA, all countries slow for various reasons to enforce social distancing and to still their population's movements, in the name of questioning a medical response that because it was dominant must be untrue.",

Targets of the virus and in Melbourne victims of its grim statistics, the anonymity and forgotten-ness of the aged showed that amongst all the changes somethings remained the same: the privileging of the discourse and significance of the new, the young, the movers and the shakers, the consumers, the able, the working, and the intellectuals \u2026",

Discerning between clickbait and proper debate became difficult. One feature of the gigantic media coverage of the virus, both personal and corporate, has been the shaming of [young] people as selfish, irresponsible, or delusional etc. for not taking social distancing seriously. Gratuitous pictures of their apparent nochelance on Melbourne's beaches circulated in media space. Literary minded folk referenced the 'party' scenes as a revelling in reckless behaviour before lockdown or illness (as in Edgar Allen Poe's story 'The Masque of the Red Death'): beach-going to spite and to spit in the face of the virus. New affective perceptions of the 'threatening' power of Melbourne's places to gather people emerged, leading to calls to 'de-magnetize' them by closure or by the enforcing of social distancing there. Snitches informed police of people-meeting.",
