            "text": "The mammalian innate immune system detects viral infections through pattern recognition receptors and initiates an immune response mediated predominantly by type I interferons (IFNs). 1 IFN-mediated cell signaling subsequently results in the transcriptional upregulation of a number of interferon-response genes encoding antiviral restriction factors that block viral propagation by diverse mechanisms. 2,3 A potent antiviral restriction mechanism involves the oligoadenylate synthase (OAS)ribonuclease (RNase) L pathway. 4 OAS genes are induced in response to IFN stimulation. 5,6 Upon binding and activation by viral double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA), catalytically active OAS isoforms convert ATP into 5'-triphosphorylated, 2 0 -5 0 linked adenylate oligomers (2-5A). 7 Trimeric and longer species of 2-5A bind to the inactive monomeric form of the pseudokinaseribonuclease RNase L to induce dimerization of the enzyme and its catalytic activation. 8,9 Activated RNase L exerts its antiviral effect by cleaving single-stranded RNA regions in viral RNAs, as well as by promoting apoptosis in infected cells through degradation of cellular mRNAs and rRNAs. 10 Thus, OAS enzymes function as pattern recognition receptors of viral dsRNA, while 2-5A is a conserved second messenger of viral infection whose only known biological function is to activate RNase L. 3, 7 In the host-pathogen arms race, viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to evade the innate immune response of the host, including direct inhibition of OAS-RNase L pathway. The genomes of coronaviruses and rotaviruses encode 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes that degrade 2-5A and prevent its cellular accumulation, thereby blocking RNase L activation. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), an enveloped (1)RNA virus of the coronavirus family, expresses a cytoplasmic 30-kDa 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase protein ns2 that functions as an IFN antagonist and is required for the induction of hepatitis. 11-13 Group A rotavirus (RVA), a member of the rotavirus family of segmented dsRNA viruses that cause severe infant diarrhea, encodes the capping enzyme VP3 that contains a C-terminal phosphodiesterase domain [ Fig. 1(A) ]. 14 Both the VP3 PDE domain and ns2 have been shown to cleave 2-5A in vitro and in vivo, thereby antagonizing RNaseL activation while enhancing viral growth and pathogenesis. 14,16 The proteins share 18% sequence identity [ Fig. 1(B) ] and are functionally interchangeable, as the VP3 PDE domain is able to rescue the replication of ns2 mutant MHV in cells expressing RNase L. 14 MHV ns2 and the C-terminal domain of RVA VP3 are members of the 2H phosphoesterase family and contain two characteristic His-X-Ser/Thr motifs in their catalytic sites. Both proteins are structurally homologous to A-kinase-anchoring protein-7 (AKAP7), a 2H phosphoesterase domain-containing protein that mediates signaling within cAMP microdomains by anchoring multiple signaling proteins. 17 AKAP7 exhibits 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase activity and can complement an inactive ns2 gene in a MHV mutant to restore infectivity of the virus. 18 Despite their essential role in antagonizing the OAS-RNase L innate immune response pathway, there is little structural information available for viral 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase enzymes. Here we report the structure of the PDE domain of the RVA VP3 protein (UniProt entry A2T3S1, residues 696-835) at a resolution of 1.39 \u00c5 , highlighting its evolutionary relationship with cellular phosphodiesterases and providing insights into the catalytic mechanism of 2-5A cleavage.",

            "text": "We compared the VP3 PDE domain with the structures of other 2H phosphoesterase enzymes using the DALI server. 29 Superposition with the phosphoesterase domain of AKAP7 30 (PDB ID 2VFK) reveals substantial structural homology, with a root mean square deviation of 2.8 \u00c5 over 137 Ca atoms [ Fig. 2(A) ]. AKAP7 adopts a globular a-b architecture consisting of four a-helices and eight b-sheets. 30 In contrast to AKAP7 and a predicted structural model of the VP3 PDE domain, 14 the crystal structure of the VP3 PDE domain lacks two a-helical segments and one b-strand in the upper lobe. The DALI search additionally identified human 3 0 -5 0 exoribonuclease USB1 31 (C16orf57, PDB ID 4H7W), 2 0 -5 0 RNA ligases from Pyrococcus horikoshii 32 (PDB ID 1VDX) and Thermus thermophilus 33 (PDB ID 1 IUH) and the 1 0 -2 0 -cyclic nucleotide 2 0 -phosphodiesterase from Arabidopsis thaliana 34 (PDB ID 1JH7) as close structural homologs, all of which contain the two additional ahelices in their upper lobes. The observed differences in secondary and tertiary structures are likely in part due to the diversity of substrate specificities across the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily. Nevertheless, the overall structural similarity underscores a clear evolutionary relationship of VP3 to vertebrate 2H phosphoesterase domain-containing proteins including AKAP7, USB1, as well as CGI-18 and LENG9. 27 This supports the hypothesis that a vertebrate host phosphodiesterase served as the ancestral precursor of 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterases harbored by rotaviruses and coronaviruses. 18 The C-terminal domain of VP3 has 2 0 ,5 0 -phosphodiesterase activity that cleaves 5 0 -AMP from the 2 0 -termini of 2-5A molecules. 14 To obtain structural insights into its catalytic mechanism of 2-5A hydrolysis, we collected diffraction data from VP3 PDE domain crystals soaked with 5 0 -AMP as well as crystals grown in the presence of 50 mM 5 0 -AMP. In neither case were we able to observe electron density corresponding to the bound cleavage product. Closer inspection of the crystal packing interfaces revealed that in all four copies in the asymmetric unit, the catalytic site of the VP3 PDE domain is blocked by the insertion of a loop (Ser759-Asp760) from a symmetry-related molecule, likely explaining the lack of ligand binding in the structure. Comparison of the active sites of AKAP7 and the VP3 PDE domain reveals that the catalytic His-X-Thr motifs are found in equivalent positions, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism of substrate cleavage is conserved in the two proteins. We therefore modeled the binding of the ligand in the active site of the VP3 PDE domain based on the superposition with the structure of AKAP7 in complex with 5 0 -AMP (PDB ID 2FVK). In AKAP7, both active site threonines donate hydrogen bonds to the phosphate oxygen atoms of the AMP product, while His224 of the second catalytic motif (equivalent to His797 in VP3) forms an additional hydrogen bond to the bridging ester oxygen [ Fig. 2(B) ]. A similar binding mode is expected in VP3, with the phosphate group being hydrogen-bonded to Thr720 and Thr799. The adenine moiety of the AMP ligand is sandwiched between the side chains of Arg219 and Phe179 in AKAP7, the two residues interacting with the base via cation-p and p-p stacking interactions, respectively. 30 While the conserved Arg792 likely fulfills the same function in VP3, the phenylalanine position is occupied by Leu758, suggesting that the precise mode of product binding might differ slightly between VP3 and AKAP7. Assuming that the bound AMP represents the product cleaved off from the 2 0 terminus of the 2-5A substrate, the adenosine residue upstream of the scissile phosphate would likely bind in the vicinity of amino acid residues Phe700, Val723, Tyr821, Arg823, and Ile825, in a conserved pocket adjacent to the catalytic site [ Figs. 1 (B,C) and 2(B)]. Hydrolysis of phosphodiesters by 2H phosphoesterases involves a nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate. The product of the reaction, however, varies depending on the attacking group and the type of ribose linkage in the substrate. We propose a catalytic mechanism of 2-5A hydrolysis for the VP3 PDE domain reminiscent of the catalytic mechanisms predicted for T. thermophilus 2 0 -5 0 ligase 33 and A. thaliana 1 0 -2 0 -cyclic nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase. 34 In VP3, the unprotonated form of His797 would act as a general base, deprotonating a water molecule for in-line nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate [ Fig. 2(C) ]. In turn, His718 acts as a general acid, facilitating the cleavage reaction by protonating the 2 0 -oxygen atom of the leaving group. During the reaction, the scissile phosphate is anchored by hydrogen bonds to Thr720 and Thr799, while the buildup of negative charge on the pentacovalent reaction intermediate might be stabilized by the overall positive surface electrostatic potential of the active site cleft.",

(B) Multiple sequence alignment for 2H phosphoesterase superfamily members displaying 2 0 ,5 0phosphodiesterase activity. Primary sequences of RVA VP3 (Uniprot ID A2T3S1), MHV ns2 (UniProt ID P19738) and human AKAP7 (Hs_AKA7G, UniProt ID Q9P0M2) proteins were aligned using MAFFT 15 with the E-INS-I strategy. Conserved catalytic His-X-Ser/Thr motifs (red boxes) and active site residues (red asterisks) are highlighted. Secondary structure elements of RVA VP3 are indicated above the sequence. (C) Crystal structure of the VP3 PDE domain. Left and middle: Two perpendicular views shown in cartoon representation. Histidine and threonine sidechains of the two His-X-Thr catalytic motifs are shown as sticks. Right: Surface representation colored according to electrostatic surface potential.",
