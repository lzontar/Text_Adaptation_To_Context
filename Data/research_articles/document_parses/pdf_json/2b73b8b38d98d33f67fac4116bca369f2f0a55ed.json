Interestingly, coronaviruses virions bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum-84 Golgi intermediate compartment, ERGIC, raising unanswered questions regarding the precise 85 mechanisms by which viral surface glycoproteins are processed as they traverse the secretory 86 pathway (21,22). Nonetheless, it has been proposed that the virus acquires a glycan coat 87 sufficient and similar enough to endogenous host protein glycosylation that it serves as a glycan 88 shield, facilitating immune evasion by masking non-self viral peptides with self-glycans (15,20-89 22). In parallel to their potential masking functions, glycan-dependent epitopes can elicit specific, 90 even neutralizing, antibody responses, as has been described for HIV-1 (15,23-26). Thus, 91 understanding the glycosylation of the viral spike trimer is fundamental for the development of 92 efficacious vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and therapeutic inhibitors of infection. 93 ACE2 is an integral membrane metalloproteinase that regulates the renin-angiotensin system 94 (27).
