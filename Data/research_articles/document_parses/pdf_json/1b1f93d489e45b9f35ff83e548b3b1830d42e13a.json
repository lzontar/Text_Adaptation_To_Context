In the 37 COVID -19 positive patients, 6 (16.2%) died. Although CT images of the chest showed the ground glass like changes, symptoms were mild, and none was admitted to ICU. The Authors underline that none of them died because of COVID-19. About 15 days later, after increasing protection measures, the universal screening and the isolation of the infected cases, the risk of infection was under control and no new cases were observed. Cheng Li [9] , from the Department of Blood Purification Center, Wuhan No.1 Hospital, Wuhan China, in a preprint report documents a wider experience from the same region where the pandemic started. The report records 66 out of 627 HD patients certainly infected (10.5%), and 24 cases \"suspected\" (i.e. the diagnosis was made just on clinical ground). The Authors treat the \"suspected\" cases as if they were real positives, thus, based on this assumption, the infection prevalence rate was 14.3% (90/627). The Authors do not report if the mortality rate between the two subgroups (proven infected and suspected ones) was different, however, putting it all together the mortality rate was 13.3% (12 patients out of 90 with confirmed or suspected infection).",
