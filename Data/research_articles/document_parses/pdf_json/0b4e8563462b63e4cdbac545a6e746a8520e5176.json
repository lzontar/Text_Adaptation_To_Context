Whereas most infected individuals are asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia), 10-20% of patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (1). Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay is relatively long, and the need for prolonged orotracheal intubation (X48 hours) is frequent (2, 3) . Although information is still limited, patients can experience post-acute consequences, including severe muscle weakness and fatigue, joint stiffness, dysphagia, (neuro)psychological problems, and impaired functioning in terms of mobility and activities of daily living (4). There is, therefore, a need to prepare for the care/rehabilitation of patients in the postacute phase. This brief communication presents preliminary results on swallowing performance and safety after extubation in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "One of the reasons why patients with COVID-19 are considered at risk for dysphagia or for some swallowing impairment is that swallowing and breathing are coordinated functions, i.e., respiration halts when the swallowing reflex is triggered, and they require the activation of common anatomical structures (5) . Breathing and swallowing are physiologically linked to ensure effortless gas exchange during oronasal breathing and to prevent aspiration during swallowing. Besides that, prolonged intubation has been shown to alter the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors of pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosae, while also causing muscle atrophy and loss of proprioception (6) . Reduced pharyngeal and laryngeal sensation places patients at higher risk of silently aspirating food and fluids into the upper airway (i.e., no cough response when aspiration occurs), which can lead to chest infection and pneumonia, malnutrition, increased length of hospital stay, and readmission to the hospital (7).",

Association National Outcome Measurement System (ASHA NOMS) (9).
