In order to face it, the Italian government has placed the whole of Italy-a country with an estimated population of 60.4 million-under quarantine.

These norms are even more rigorous in Lombardy, a large region in northern Italy, where most hot zones (i.e., where COVID-19 cases are more concentrated) have been reported to date.",
