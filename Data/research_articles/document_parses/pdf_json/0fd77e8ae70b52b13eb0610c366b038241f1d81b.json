This commentary reviews the numerous biologic mechanisms that have been presented in recent literature that may explain why people with diabetes fare worse with COVID-19 than those without.

SARS-CoV-2 may infect circulating immune cells and cause increased cell death of these more helpful immune cells, leading to lymphocytopenia, which is associated with worse severity of COVID-19 [4] . The death of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells relieves inhibition and effective modulation of the innate immune system, causing an exaggerated deluge of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a cytokine storm. Specifically, recent reports have shown that there are reduced numbers of memory T lymphocytes, Treg subtypes, and helper T cells in patients with severe COVID-19 [15] .

According to a paper published recently in Physiologic Reviews, \"the cleavage of the new furin sites in the S protein of the [COVID-19] virus by plasmin...may enhance its infectivity by expediting entry, fusion, duplication, and release in respiratory cells. Elevated plasmin(ogen) and furin levels are a common feature in COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions, and could be an independent factor for risk stratification of patients with COVID-19 [4, 18] .\" For the virus to infect, the S1 region of its spike fusion protein is cut and released by proteases, allowing the virus to be absorbed into the cell. In short, proteases normally elevated in diabetes may be facilitating viral entry into human cells [4] . 5 . Diabetes changes lung structure and glucose levels in lung fluid, which may increase the ability of the virus to replicate.",

Additionally, exposure to this trace-gas also has been linked to development of diabetes and many other chronic diseases, and is a potent driver of cytokine release and inflammatory cascades [20] . Minimizing exposure to environmental pollutants may serve a role in quelling the underlying proinflammatory state that characterizes metabolic disease and COVID-19 associated cytokine storms, however more research needs to be done to confirm this. Other environmental toxins, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) found in air, water, and food generated from pesticides and industrial chemicals, are also strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome; promoting \"clean living,\" toxinavoidant strategies for patients as simple as emphasizing organic foods, home air purification, and non-toxic home supplies could be considered, although the clinical utility of these measures in the acute setting is unknown [21] . 7.
