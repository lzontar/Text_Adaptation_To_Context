March-2020 onwards; importation of cases from rest of the countries followed by seeding of local transmission triggered further outbreaks in India. We used ARTIC protocol based tiling amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 (n=104) from different states of India using a combination of MinION and MinIT from Oxford Nanopore Technology to understand introduction and local transmission. The analyses revealed multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from Europe and Asia following local transmission. The most prevalent genomes with patterns of variance (confined in a cluster) remain unclassified, here, proposed as A4-clade based on its divergence within A-cluster. The viral haplotypes may link their persistence to geoclimatic conditions and host response. Despite the effectiveness of non-therapeutic interventions in India, multipronged strategies including molecular surveillance based on real-time viral genomic data is of paramount importance for a timely management of the pandemic.",

March 2020 onwards, India also witnessed a surge of imported cases from countries other than China which has been further assisted with local transmission. In March, imposition of nationwide lockdown checked the epidemic curve. Despite these measurements, India is at the verge of a large outbreak as the transmission is rapidly increasing with more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19 having been reported in the third week of May, 2020.",

The virus was named as \"SARS-CoV-2\" and the disease it causes has been defined as \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (CSG, 2020) . WHO declared COVID-19 a Pandemic on 11 th of March, 2020 based on the speed and scale of transmission with almost 4.7 million cases reported across the globe, so far (WHO, 18th May 2020). The common signs of infection by SARS-CoV-2 include cough, fever, sore throat, respiratory symptoms inclusive of shortness/difficulties in breathing. More severe symptoms can include pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death with coalescence of factors (Zhu et al., 2020 , Youg et al., 2020 . Many COVID-19 cases have been reported to be asymptomatic and may serve as carrier of SARS-CoV-2 (Xu et al., 2020; He et al., 2020) . Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 suggest bat-CoV to be its closest progenitor with 96% homology but, the RNA binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein with an efficient binding to ACE-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cell seems to have been derived from Pangolin-CoVs (Wan et al., 2020 , Andersen et al., 2020 . Next generation sequencing (NGS) aided understanding of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and its transmission patterns after it enters a new population is proving to be an important step towards formulating strategies for management of this pandemic (Chen and Li et al., 2020) .",

In nucleocapsid, there are two structural domains, the N-and Cterminal connected via a long linker region that facilitates RNA packing [Kang et al., 2020] . We found that all the mutations, including P13L found in 53 genomes, are present outside these domains, specifically, linker regions (S194L, G204R, R203K), and the N-arm of the protein (P13L). The nsp12 is a highly conserved protein with multiple domains. The observed mutations are overlaying onto the interface (P323L) and NiRAN (A97L) region. The latter is critical as it contains a Zn+ binding site, however, little is known about the exact functional output. In contrast, the P323L mutation is present on protein interaction junctions where a hydrophobic cleft is known to bind to inhibitors ( Figure 6B) . This variant will result in loss of kink due to amino acid substitution from proline to leucine, i.e., 5-membered amino acid which resides in the buried area of the protein from to an acyclic amino acid. The nsp3 protein has a similar higher order domain arrangement, and the mutation is present on the NAB domain, which is a nucleic acid binding domain and also interacts with nsp12. This mutation may impact RNA synthesis machinery; however, little is known about its exact mechanism of action. Lastly, the D614G mutation in spike protein is an interesting substitution and has been reported with increased tally [Korber et al., 2020; Chnadrika et al., 2020] . Structurally, this mutation is located in the S1 subunit that also contains the RBD domain. Although present outside the functional region, the proximity of D614G around S1 cleavage site implicates an important change in the local environment.",

            "text": "This is the first comprehensive genomic picture of the SARS-CoV-2 prevalent in the Indian population during the early phase of outbreaks. The understanding is important keeping in view the vast geographical expanse and population density of India. There were three major waves of viral entry in India associated with multiple outbreaks (Figure 7) . First wave includes importation of SARS-CoV-2 (A2a cluster) through travelers from Europe (Italy, UK, France etc) and the USA. Second wave of SARS-CoV-2 (A3 cluster) was linked with the Middle East (Iran and Iraq). Third wave comprises combined viral (haplotype redefined as A4) entries from Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia) and Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan). The study taken together with other reported genomes (Potdar et al., 2020) revealed A4 cluster (previously unclassified) is the most prevalent in Indian population. Many novel mutations identified may be specific to Indian conditions but more genomic data is needed to strengthen the assumption to rule out sampling bias and other factors (Lu et al., 2020) . During the early phase of the epidemic in India, imported cases followed by local transmission were restricted to urban regions where effective IDSP network, diagnostic support, health care services and timely placed interventions (nationwide lockdown, establishment of containment zones and practicing social distance) interrupted community transfer. The mounting burden of epidemic in urban regions associated with job crunch forced migrant workers to return to their home mostly situated in rural areas which is an impending threat of the viral entries in rural regions (comprising major portion of the Indian population) and expected community transmission. To tackle domestic transmission at larger scale and higher risk of community transfer, preventive measures shall be strengthened in rural regions in addition to safe transportation arrangements for domestic migrants.",

These observations are important to consider the variants especially that map to the Indian genomes during such prioritization studies since these strains would now form a major fraction of the genomes that are likely to become more prevalent in India after lockdown. Mapping of these variant genomes in conjunction with the clinical history in terms of recovery, hospitalization and co-morbidity might allow identification of variants that should be actionable and would also have relevance for prognosis. It is imperative that robust genomic data based on large sample size including rural populations with even distribution can bring out the real scenario once correlated with epidemiological data eventually helping in drafting of further management policies.

B) Genome coverage and sequencing depth of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We plotted the Ct value of the two genes (E-gene and RdRp gene) used for RT-PCR vis-a-vis genome %age coverage and sequencing depth of the samples (Blue -missing N% below 5 and Orange -N% above 5). In general, it was observed that samples with lower Ct value have higher average sequencing depth and genome coverage compared to higher Ct value samples. C) Genetic variants across ONT and Illumina platform. A subset of ONT sequenced samples were sequenced on MiSeq to benchmark the genetic variants observed in the positive samples. The genetic variants marked in yellow are the same between the two platforms.",
