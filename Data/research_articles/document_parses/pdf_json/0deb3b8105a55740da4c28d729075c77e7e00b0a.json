That is, the more decision makers are oriented toward the future, the more weight they assign to prospective rather than immediate outcomes of a purchase decision (Hansen et al., 2007) . Thus, during the progressing coronavirus pandemic these decision makers may be less affected by the prospect of delayed cash flows or profits following a purchase decision.
