In study cohorts of Wuhan, the median age of affected patients ranges from 49-56 years 4,22,23 . In previous studies on COVID-19, it has been established that risk increases with age and comorbidities 13,22,23 . The broad based nature of India's population pyramid means there are more people in the younger age group and very few people in the \u226580 years age group. Another reason is that as there is limited evidence of community spread in the epidemic in India so far; it has been reported to be driven by imported cases who mostly belong to the younger age group. In 2018, Indian residents between 35 and 49 years of age took the most holidays outside the nation 24 . On normalizing the percentage of patients in each age group with the corresponding percentage representation of the population, we observed that the highest number of patients is in the 60-79 years age group category. Interestingly, according to this analysis, men in the 60-79 years age group are affected more than the \u226580 years age group. This is something that has not been reported until now and it has to be seen whether this changes as the number of cases in India grows. This is new to the literature of COVID-19 and needs to be studied further.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Second, we found a case fatality rate of 2.5%, which is lower than countries like Italy 25 . The reason for this could be that Italy is in the later phases of the epidemic with widespread community transmission and high mortality due to overburdening of the health system. This has also led to focussing testing on severe patients and possible advise to suspected patients with mild symptoms to stay at home. In China, the case fatality rate was found as 2.3%, 14.8% in the above 80 years population, and 8.0% in the 70-79 years population 13 . Our estimate gives a slightly higher value, which may be due a smaller sample size or can also be because mild cases of COVID-19 have so far been missed due to restricted testing strategy during the initial stage.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Third, from the SIR model, the values of \u03b2 and the trend for R t shows that the interventions which were put in place by the Indian government starting from mid-March were partially effective, preventing the scenario where R t can reach even more than four 26 . The increase in \u03b2 from day eight is probably due to the identification of a cluster in Delhi 27 . Additionally, Indian Council of Medical Research recently updated the testing strategy, which might have increased the detection of the positive cases significantly. According to a study in the early days of the epidemic, Wuhan city and Hubei province reported R t between 1.85 and 4.46, which aligns with our study findings 26 . All over China, the R t varied from 1.23 to 5.77. South Korea, which has high population density like India, had a decreasing trend of R t from 9.72 on 20 February to 1.50 on 7 March.

Hence we are addressing more dynamicity and realness by taking into account multiple compartments with robust mathematical assumptions in our future models to study the current pandemic.

I congratulate them on their work. However a few queries:The data analysis has been performed on 1161 patients. To project it for such a large population has limited scope.The range of the projection of 1.10 lakh to 2.20 lakh is quite wide. How do we interpret it?In COVID, most of the patients recover in due course. If possible, the SEIR model could have been used for a better picture.The discussion section contains a comparison with the descriptive data of different countries. It could have been compared with the modeling data of different studies of other countries to highlight the similarity/difference of the Indian scenario.The authors in the discussion state that \"we observed that the highest number of patients is in the 60-79 years age group category. The exact percentage projected needs to be mentioned.The assumptions that the authors took for the modeling approach needs to be clearly stated in the methodology apart from birth and death rate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Soumya Swaroop Sahoo"}, {"text": "Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?

And also, not all susceptible individuals are infected. Why was the \"SEIR\" model not considered by authors? Although, the model mentions that the birth rate and death rate were not taken into account, its effect on outcome estimation has not been explicitly mentioned. The reason that the duration of infection is much lesser than the lifetime of an individual can be explanatory for non-inclusion of birth and death rate.Clear mention of the force of infection with proper notation is required.Reasons for the younger age group being affected more can be explained in greater detail.Various studies have been published to date with different modelling techniques for the estimation of COVID-19 cases.
