[35] [36] [37] According to the key domains of pharmacist interventions, most studies were carried out for healthcare professionals and patients. Pharmacist-provided interventions with the recipients have been shown to improve patient outcomes and contribute to substantial healthcare savings. 38 In contrast, two studies did not classify as to the recipient of the intervention because the DEPICT version 2 did not predict interventions in the general population. It is important to note that pharmacists can play a role in health education and disease prevention in various ways for the general population. [39] [40] [41] [42] Moreover, the level of pharmacist-recipient interaction varied between studies. Most of them described the use of telephone, written interaction including web-based, and video conference. Studies involving the use of these methods of communication have been successful [43] [44] [45] and these valuable tools may be applied in a social distancing context. In addition, one study reported that pharmacists used a hospital's radio station as a communication strategy in patients who had difficulty in dealing with available technologies, highlighting the creative character. 22 Regarding the setting of intervention, most studies were performed in hospital bedside, ambulatory, and recipient's home. Pharmacist interventions were described in several settings [46] [47] [48] as to improving the quality of care. Unfortunately, only two studies related the community pharmacy as the setting of intervention. A recent study discussed the role of community pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, collecting and summarizing the experience of Chinese community pharmacies. 49 It is well known that community pharmacies are an important setting of care in the COVID-19 pandemic period and further studies in this context should be encouraged.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 544, "end": 546, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 668, "end": 672, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 673, "end": 677, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 678, "end": 682, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 962, "end": 964, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1281, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1286, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1287, "end": 1291, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1296, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1566, "end": 1570, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1575, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1580, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1870, "end": 1872, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2060, "end": 2064, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2069, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2366, "end": 2368, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General view of the studies"}, {"text": "Drug information for healthcare professionals and patient counseling were the main actions provided by the pharmacists identified in this review, similarly with other studies. 48, 50 These actions focus on enhancing the problem solving skills of the patient for the purpose of improving or maintaining the quality of life. 18 In addition, other actions (drug supply management and safety measures for infection control) were also identified in some studies.
