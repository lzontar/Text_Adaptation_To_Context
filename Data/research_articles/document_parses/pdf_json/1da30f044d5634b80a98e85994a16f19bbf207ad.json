The detailed NCCN and ACMS 36 recommendations are available online (https://www.nccn.org/covid-19/default.aspx and 37 https://www.facs.org/covid-19/clinical-guidance), and here we provide our perspective 1 .38 Clinical judgment should be exercised on a case-by-case basis while interpreting the 39 general guidelines. All efforts should be directed towards minimizing unnecessary exposures to 40 patients and staff. Excisional biopsies with narrow margins to completely remove all suspicious 41 lesions including melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), and others should be attempted to 42 minimize travel and to allow for delays in definitive treatment, if necessary. 43 We divide skin cancers into low-, intermediate-and high-risk categories to guide 44 treatment decisions. The low-risk category includes basal cell carcinoma (BCC), cutaneous 45 squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in situ and cSCC without high-risk factors (\u22652 cm in diameter, 46 poorly differentiated histologically, perineural invasion \u22650.1 mm, invasion beyond subcutaneous 47 fat), 2 melanoma in situ, and indolent cutaneous lymphomas. For this category, elective therapies, 48 surgeries, and radiation may be postponed for at least 3 months. Again, clinical judgment on 49 case-by-case basis weighing individual risks for the patient, including risks of serious 50 complications and death from COVID-19, should be exercised. 51 For the intermediate-risk category (T1 melanomas with clear margins post-biopsy, T1 52 melanoma without a clear margin, assuming the majority of the tumor was removed, and T1b 53 melanoma without high-risk features), wide local excisions (WLE) and sentinel lymph node 54 biopsies should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be postponed.",
