In a forthcoming paper in Science, researchers at Oxford argue that COVID-19 spreads too quickly and asymptomatically to be controllable through traditional contact tracing methods. 19 To alleviate the need for long term mass social distancing, the authors of that study argue that communities will need to deploy \"instant digital contact tracing.\" 20 15 Id. 16 COVID-19 testing and support for quarantining identified contacts, undermine the efficacy of digital contact tracing efforts that its proponents seemingly take for granted. 21 As for privacy, digital contact tracing efforts abroad already raise significant cause for concern. These mass surveillance programs sweep up revealing location data indiscriminately. Although they are defended on grounds of emergency and the urgent need to contend with the present health crisis, experiences in those countries already reveal the potential for abuse. Moreover, our own history amply demonstrates that surveillance powers claimed on emergency grounds frequently remain after the emergency has passed, often morphing into tools of social control targeted against Should the political branches fail to perform on these duties, then the courts, as guardians of the Fourth Amendment's sacred trust, must act.",

It is important here to distinguish between two distinct Fourth Amendment questions: whether government action constitutes a \"search,\" and, if so, what form of prospective restraint is necessary to guarantee the security of the people against unreasonable search. When answering the \"search\" question, it does not matter whether the government agent is engaged primarily in criminal law enforcement or public health. A search is a search, whether conducted by police looking for evidence of a crime or the CDC looking for traces of a contagion. By contrast, when addressing the remedy question, it matters quite a bit whether a search is conducted to advance a criminal investigation or to advance other governmental interests.

Part II cautions that the absence of a firm warrant requirement for digital contact tracing should not serve as a green light for unregulated digital location tracking, whether in the form of individual or aggregate surveillance, and by means of location or proximity tracking.23  In light of substantial risks to privacy that a digital contact tracing program might entail, this Article argues for a thoughtful, constitutionally sufficient, legislative scheme that does not indulge the hubris of emergency, assert claims of broad, unchecked power, or follow the siren's song of technovelty.

The epidemiological surveillance programs discussed in recent months, be they individual tracking, location monitoring, or the use of aggregate data, are likely to fall under the special needs doctrine because their purpose is to address public health challenges rather than to effect the goals of traditional law enforcement. The Court has endorsed public health as a legitimate ground for special needs searches on a number of occasions 53 where the programs are sufficiently likely to succeed in serving a legitimate public interest 54 and stayed true to their public health goals.55  The centerpiece of the special needs doctrine is the balancing of compelling government interests served by searches against the privacy interests of those subject to potential search. In the present context, there is no doubt that there are significant public health interests at stake. Proper interventions could well save thousands, if not hundreds of policy interests while still guaranteeing the right of the people to be secure from threats of unreasonable searches and seizures.

The privacy harms of digital location tracking are exacerbated the longer tracking lasts and the longer data remains available to government agents.85  The Supreme Court has recognized that the time-machine nature of digital location tracking is inconsistent with \"a central aim of the Framers . . . to place obstacles in the way of a too permeating police surveillance.\" 86 Strict durational limits on data collection, storage, and destruction are vital to minimize threats to privacy posed by epidemiological surveillance programs.For example, current public health practice recommends a two-week quarantine or active monitoring period for individuals potentially infected with the COVID-19 virus. 87 A similar durational limit would be appropriate for location data utilized for digital contact tracing. Only contacts within that fourteen-day period are likely to be at risk of infection, with more temporally distant contacts having interacted with the infected person before they were infected or contagious. It therefore seems that location data should be collected and retained only for two weeks at a time, after which it should be destroyed. Insofar as there may be good reasons to extend this window, the point remains that it is important to set limits on how much data is retained and for how long. access, analysis, and use. Access to the data gathered, aggregated, and stored as part of an epidemiological surveillance program-and authority to query that data-should be strictly limited to those whose access is essential for the program to function. This data should not be available to people, groups, or algorithms for purposes unrelated to digital contact tracing 25 and certainly should not be open source. The reason is straightforward: Mission creep imperils the success and constitutional soundness of such a program as does the risk of abuse.For instance, mass digital location data would surely aid the Department of Justice in investigating and prosecuting crimes or the Department of Homeland Security in tracking and arresting undocumented immigrants in the United States. But these uses would plainly diverge from the purposes undergirding this digital location data program. So, too, would a functionary's use of the data to trace a former spouse's movement and associations. Just as data should be siloed to prevent its misuse, access and authority to query this data should be zealously guarded, privileging public health efforts and excluding law enforcement or other efforts. Absent such segmentation, the Supreme Court's recent epistle on digital location privacy in Carpenter would be meaningless.Similarly, even within the public health arena, the use of this mass surveillance data must be strictly limited to its intended purpose. For instance, while digital location data might be accessible to public health officials engaged in contact tracing efforts, it would be inappropriate for that data to be accessible to government officials charged with enforcing general social distancing orders. 88 This constitutes a separate purpose requiring independent justification.Moreover, if decentralization of data is possible, then direct access by any government entity might well be unnecessary, and therefore inappropriate.The program must end. A well-designed and well-justified epidemiological surveillance program designed to combat COVID-19 must be coupled with strict sunset provisions. The War on Terror, launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, is instructive in the way that demands for emergency authority can act as one-way ratchets, effecting permanent expansions of surveillance88  But seeGian Volpicelli, The NHS Coronavirus App Could Track How Long You Spend Outside, WIRED, Apr. 7,  2020, https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nhs-coronavirus-tracking-app.    powers, and how crises can metastasize, developing into perpetual claims of emergency. It is telling that, in the midst of the current crisis, Congress once again granted a reprieve to the National Security Agency's troubled Section 215 program, which originated the bulk collection of telephonic metadata. 89 Once a tool like contact tracing is operational, it will be tempting for public health officials to utilize this tool to combat other infectious diseases. Seasonal influenza, after all, sickens millions and kills thousands each year. 90 The ability to more easily track and trace the flu would surely aid public health efforts. Yet this, too, would constitute unjustified mission creep.Recursive review. Finally, audit procedures should be required to ensure accountability after the fact. Audit trails or other documentation should enable review of who gains access to sensitive location data, on what authority, and for what queries. In addition, program managers",
