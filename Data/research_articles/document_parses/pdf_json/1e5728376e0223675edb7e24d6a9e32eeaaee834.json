COVID-19 is, in fact, complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for a high number of patients needing mechanical ventilation or intensive care units (ICU) treatment and for the elevated mortality risk. However, lung damage is not the only reason for the high death risk as other organs such as heart and kidney may be seriously damaged and favor poor survival. This entails that SARS-CoV-2 is a multiorgan disease with mechanisms such as, for example, systemic inflammation which may precipitate organ failure. A link between COVID-19 and multiorgan failure may be dependent on the fact that almost all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease are complicated by pneumonia, which is known to be associated with systemic inflammation and thrombotic-related events such as myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke. 1, 2 Accordingly, previous studies reported that patients with pneumonia display changes of clotting and platelet activation, 3, 4 which occur during the early phase of disease and may precipitate systemic or local thrombosis. It is arguable, therefore, that SARS-CoV-2 patients may experience thrombotic events in coronary and cerebral trees or in other circulatory districts including lung and kidney. Clinical data so far reported are suggestive of vascular complications occurring in the coronary circulation while the involvement of other districts is still unclear. [5] [6] [7] Conversely, there are many studies reporting that the behavior of clotting variables and platelet count in COVID-19 patients is suggestive of a hypercoagulation Keywords \u25ba thrombosis \u25ba hypercoagulability \u25ba infectious diseases",

Recent data showed that myocardial injury compatible with coronary ischemia may be detectable in SARS-CoV-2 patients and laboratory data exploring clotting system suggest the presence of a hypercoagulation state. Thus, we performed a systematic review of COVID-19 literature reporting measures of clotting activation to assess if changes are detectable in this setting and their relationship with clinical severity.

The percentage of patients with elevated D-dimer was almost wide with high values ranging from 14 to 46%. Analysis of D-dimer according to disease severity was reported in six studies (\u25baTable 2), and all consistently showed increased values of D-dimer in patients with severe versus nonsevere disease; significance was shown in all but two studies. 14,17 These data are in accordance with a recent meta-analysis showing enhanced D-dimer according to disease severity. 18",

            "text": "Hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 are frequently complicated by serious pneumonia, which may occur, from roughly 80 to 100% of cases. 11, 21, 22 Considering that respiratory tract infections are associated with an increased risk of vascular disease, including artery and venous thrombosis, it is not surprising that SARS-CoV-2 may be complicated by clotting changes that ultimately lead to thrombosis. Among artery thrombosis complications patients with pneumonia may experience MI in approximately 10% of cases, and less frequently, ischemic stroke. 3 In SARS-CoV-2 patients, detailed description of cardiovascular complications is still lacking even if in some reports it is possible to appreciate data indicating the occurrence of myocardial damage as depicted by enhanced levels of troponin associated or less with EKG changes compatible with MI. 6, 7 Conversely, no data have been so far reported regarding deep venous thrombosis. Systemic coagulation abnormalities, including clotting activation and inhibition of anticoagulant factors, have been observed not only in sepsis but also in pneumonia. At this last regard, we have previously reported that pneumonia may be associated with clotting activation as well as lowering of natural anticoagulants. Thus, we found enhanced levels of the prothrombin fragment F1 \u00fe 2, which is a marker of thrombin generation, along with impaired activation of the anticoagulant Protein C. These changes occurred during the acute phase of the disease and tended to normalize at the discharge. 4 Platelet activation has been investigated by measuring the soluble levels of CD40L and P-selectin, which were both elevated during the acute phase of pneumonia, along with an overproduction of platelet thromboxane (Tx) B2 23 ; of note, platelet TxB2 was independently associated with the occurrence of MI. Finally, we observed that patients with pneumonia display impaired artery dilatation, which is detectable during the acute phase of the disease and improve at discharge. 24 The mechanism accounting for these changes is not clear, but it is intriguing that Nox2, which is the most important enzyme generating reactive oxidant species (ROS), is overactivated in patients with pneumonia. 25 Thus, Nox2 is implicated in artery dilatation and platelet activation by inactivating nitric oxide or enhancing platelet eicosanoid production; experimental model of platelet-related thrombosis provided support to the role of Nox2 as in Nox2 animal knockout thrombus growth is prevented. 26, 27 Thus, there are at least three changes occurring during the acute phase of pneumonia, which may precipitate artery and/or venous thrombosis (\u25baFig. 2). The mechanisms accounting for clotting and vascular changes have not been defined yet by systemic inflammation, including production of reactive oxidant ROS might have a role. In this context, there are growing body of experimental and clinical evidence that Nox2-derived ROS are implicated in both clotting and platelet activation, acting as intrasignaling pathway to promote thrombin generation and platelet aggregation or to impair artery dilatation 26, 27 (\u25baFig. 2) . Data regarding Nox2 in SARS-CoV-2 patients are still lacking but should be investigated as experimental data provided evidence for a role played by Nox2 upregulation in the systemic inflammation and pathogenicity elicited by several RNA viruses including influenza virus. 28 Data regarding clotting changes in SARS-CoV-2 are still sparse and elusive. The only finding which could be consistent with clotting activation is the increase of D-dimer; however, which is not specific for clotting activation as it may also increase as result of systemic proteolysis. 29 There is also a trend toward PT prolongation and low platelet count in patients with severe disease, suggesting a role for coagulation in precipitating poor outcomes. Preliminary data regarding the relationship between elevated D-dimer and poor outcome would be in favor of this hypothesis, but limited study methodology precludes definite conclusions. 12",

The finding more consistent in support of this hypothesis is the increase of D-dimer, which is almost evident in patients with severe; in a small series of a retrospective study, D-dimer was associated with poor survival. 16 Concerning PT, aPTT and platelet count data are more elusive even if there is a trend for changes suggestive of a hypercoagulationstate in patients with severe disease. Thus, future study should employ more sophisticated methodology to screen for hypercoagulation state and, in the same time, clarify if platelet activation occurs also in this setting; in this last context, analysis of systemic markers of platelet activation such as soluble P-selectin or IIb/IIIa could be useful to address this issue. In the meantime, a hot issue is if SARS-CoV-2 patients should be treated or not with antithrombotic drugs and if the clinical presentation may drive this therapeutic decision (\u25baFig. 3). On the basis of previous reports showing that patients with pneumonia are associated with platelet and clotting activation, 3, 4 interventional trials aimed at assessing the efficacy of antithrombotic treatment, including aspirin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be planned: preliminary data suggested a potential efficacy of aspirin in patients with pneumonia. 30 Antithrombotic treatment could be investigated in patients with severe pneumonia or pneumonia complicated by ARDS 31 or by sepsis 32 or needing mechanical ventilation/ICU; the gray area is in case of no pneumonia or pneumonia with low mortality risk according to several risk scores such as PSI, 33 CURB65, 34 or SOFA, 32 in which antithrombotic treatment may be questionable; the coexistence of elevate D-dimer in patients with mild pneumonia may be another setting to be investigated (\u25baFig. 3).",
