We firstly estimated the viral transcription activity within RT samples using viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs), which is only synthesised in infected host cells [9] . The sgmRNA abundance was measured as the ratio of short reads spanning the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) sites to the viral genomic reads. The sgmRNA abundance within nasal and throat swab samples was similar to that within sputum samples (Figure 1a) , reflecting an active viral replication in the upper respiratory tract. Notably, the patient P01, who eventually passed away due to COVID-19, showed the highest level of sgmRNA abundance ( Figure S1 ). Among the samples from patients with improved clinical outcomes, their viral Ct (cycle threshold) value of reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) negatively correlated with the days post symptoms onset (Figure 1b) . Interestingly, the sgmRNA abundance showed a similar trend across time (Figure 1c ). This result is further strengthened by the positive correlation between sgmRNA abundance and the Ct value (Figure 1d) , reflecting a direct biological association between viral replication and viral shedding in the respiratory tract tissues.",

The samples were firstly categorised into intra-host pairs (serial samples from the same host), intra-household pairs and inter-household pairs (Figure 2b and Table   S4 ). As expected, the intra-host pairs had the lowest genetic distance compared to either intrahousehold pairs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.018) and inter-household pairs (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P < 2.22e-16). Interestingly, the genetic distance between intra-household pairs was significantly lower than that of inter-household pairs (Figure 2b ; Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.03), supporting a direct passage of virions among intra-household individuals. Nonetheless, we only observed a few minor variants shared among intra-household pairs, suggesting that the estimated genetic similarity was mostly determined by consensus nucleotide differences (Figure 2c,d) . Specifically, in one intrahousehold pair (P23 and P24), one patient (P23) contained iSNVs that were coincided with the linked variants, C8782T and T28144C, suggesting that this patient may have been co-infected by genetically distinct viruses. However, the strain carrying C8782T and T28144C was not observed in the intrahousehold counterpart (P24). It is likely that there is a narrow transmission bottleneck allowing only the major strain to be circulated, if P23 was infected by all the observed viral strains before the transmission.",

The estimated bottleneck sizes were 6 (P03 and P11) and 8 (P23 and P24) for the two intra-household pairs (Table S5) . This result is consistent with the patterns observed in many animal viruses and human respiratory viruses [11, 12] , while the only study reporting a loose bottleneck among human respiratory viral infections [13] was argued as the generic consequence of shared iSNVs caused by read mapping artefacts [14] . The relatively narrow transmission bottleneck sizes is expected to increase the variance of viral variants being circulated between transmission pairs [15] . Even after successful transmission, virions carrying the minor variants are likely to be purged out due to the frequent stochastic dynamics within the respiratory tract [7] , which is also consistent with the low diversity and instable iSNV observed among the RT samples.

Although the number of transmitted virions is sparse, they can easily replicate in the respiratory tract, given the observed viral replication activities in all the RT sample types and the high host-cell receptor binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 [16]. The narrow transmission bottleneck also indicate that instant hand hygiene and mask-wearing might be particular effective in blocking the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, we have characterized and compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of patients within and across households using both metatranscriptomic and hybrid-capture based techniques. Our work showed an active viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolution. The present work enhanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and shed light on the integration of genomic and epidemiological in the control of this virus",
