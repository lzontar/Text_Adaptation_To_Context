For users, they benefit from the sharing behavior as it might enable them to create online personal healthcare knowledge repositories (Mano, 2014) . If needed, users could conveniently retrieve and access these articles that have been shared on social media platforms. When we finalized this manuscript, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has forced many people to do activities online. An emerging trend we observed is that people share relevant articles, which healthcare professionals published on social media platforms, with their friends or family so as to increase their awareness to defend against the virus. Therefore, we focus on such health information sharing: users actively choosing to share an article provided by trustworthy healthcare professionals through sharing functions, or post a link to an article on social media platforms.",

First, current literature suggests that users' intention to share health information on social media may differ in terms of their levels of eHealth literacy (e.g., Chi, He, Han, & Jiang, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018) . eHealth literacy refers to the extent to which a user possesses the capacity to seek, understand, evaluate and use online health information needed to make appropriate health-related decisions (Norman & Skinner, 2006; Van der Vaart et al., 2011) . Generally, compared to their counterparts, users who hold a high level of eHealth literacy tend to actively engage in online health-related activities, such as health information seeking and use (Chang et al., 2015; Quinn, Bond, & Nugent, 2017; Zhang, Sun, & Kim, 2017) .",

Content valence refers to the overall emotions embedded in an online article, which are commonly classified as positive and negative (Meng et al., 2018) . For a given health topic, positive and negative writing styles may yield distinct stories (Kim, 2015) . Additionally, extant research reveals mixed findings regarding the effect of content valence on online information diffusion. For example, negative online articles seem to draw readers' attention quickly and cause more transmissions (e.g., Chua & Banerjee, 2018; Yin, Zhang, & Liu, 2020) . By contrast, some research argues that positive online articles could drive information seekers to share it with others (e.g., Berger & Milkman, 2012; Myrick, 2017) . Hence, current literature has not achieved a consensus on whether positive or negative online health articles evoke users' intention to share.",

It is a multifaceted construct including several key dimensions such as essential mastery of medical knowledge and information-search skills, which are adapted from health literacy and H. Zhao, et al. Information Processing and Management 57 (2020) 102354 online information literacy (Crook, Stephens, Pastorek, Mackert, & Donovan, 2016; Van de Vord, 2010; Van der Vaart et al., 2011) . We compared the three related constructs-health literacy, online information literacy, and eHealth literacy-based on the review of relevant literature (e.g., Institute of Medicine, 2004; Van de Vord, 2010; Van der Vaart et al., 2011) . We find that despite overlaps between each concept, they highlight several distinct abilities of online users. The comparison between the three constructs is presented in Table 1 . First, regarding health literacy, it emphasizes that users should receive health education and master essential health and medical knowledge (Institute of Medicine, 2004) . Such knowledge can help them make informed health-related decisions, including healthcare services selection, disease prevention, and health promotion (Fu, Chen, & Zheng, 2020; Nutbeam, 2000) . Prior research also indicates that users who have high health literacy are more likely to share health information with others (e.g., Crook, Stephens, Pastorek, Mackert, & Donovan, 2016; Pian, Song, & Zhang, 2020) . This is perhaps because those who hold high health literacy can recognize and articulate their health information needs and thus know how to share the health information with others effectively.",

In our research context, whether users are willing to share health articles on social media might involve relevant online health interactions. When a user with a high level of eHealth literacy reads an online health article, he or she may flexibly connect medical knowledge embedded in the article to the reality such as one's current health condition and lifestyle. Consequently, the user might share the article with others for further discussions or clarifications (Chi et al., 2018) . Users sharing a health article could also be a critical step to make a healthrelated decision such as deciding to inform doctors and discuss with them (Chen, Guo, Wu, & Ju, 2020) . Unfortunately, relevant empirical investigations into the impact of eHealth literacy on the intention to share are still lacking. Thus, we propose the first hypothesis as follows.",

Such selfconfidence also affects their assessment of the specific content characteristics of given online information that they are exposed to, as well as their related information-search experience (Knobloch-Westerwick & Kleinman, 2012) . For instance, if people are more confident in their initial beliefs, they are more likely to form an extreme confirmation bias (e.g., very agree or very disagree) when encountering online information. In this case, people are inclined to process the information by leveraging their preexisting beliefs rather than the content characteristics of the information or their particular information-seeking and information-use experience (Yin et al., 2016) .",

RQ 1b: How does confirmation bias moderate the relation between content valence and intention to share? We choose young people in China as our study participants for three reasons. First, young people are active users on social media platforms all over the world (Proulx, 2017) . They are increasingly adopting these platforms for information sharing, including sharing health-related issues (Korda & Itani, 2013) . Second, against the backdrop of China's fast development and transformation, young Chinese nowadays face more severe mental and physical health problems than their predecessors (e.g., Gong et al., 2012; Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, & McGorry, 2007) . Accordingly, health information sharing on social media may become one vital means to enhance their healthcare self-awareness (Byron, Albury, & Evers, 2013) . Third, research on health information sharing via social media among Chinese young people still lags. To respond to such a drawback, we thus investigate this particular group of social media users.",

According to the Cronbach's \u03b1 values (threshold value >0.70) and factor loadings (threshold value >0.50) of the table, we can conclude that the variables have good reliabilities (Qiu, Pang, & Lim, 2012) .

Information Processing and Management 57 (2020) 102354 health-related topics, when initially providing them with health articles. In the process, consumers' eHealth literacy can be measured through professional scales (e.g., Norman & Skinner, 2006) , while confirmation bias can be assessed by the propensity of their initial attitudes toward such topics (Vydiswaran et al., 2015) . However, such suggestions are also contingent on related platforms' affordances and system settings. If possible, health information providers are encouraged to serve the consumers based on their respective eHealth literacy and the assessment of their initial beliefs about a certain topic. For consumers who hold a low level of eHealth literacy, the providers may offer positive health articles about the topic similar to their initial beliefs to a great extent (forming an extreme positive confirmation bias). On the other hand, for consumers who hold a high level of eHealth literacy, the providers may offer positive articles about the topic that leads to their polarized confirmation bias or offer negative articles about the topic that may lead to their relatively moderate confirmation bias. As suggested by previous research (e.g., Vydiswaran et al., 2015) , confirmation bias can be controlled by recommending articles that are inconsistent with consumers' initial beliefs but full of persuasive and informative arguments.",

Although a controlled lab experiment can ensure the internal validity of this study, the external validity (i.e., generalizability) might face challenges. For this study, we used a between-participants design and each participant was exposed to only one type of online health articles (positive or negative). However, in reality, users tend to browse multiple online health articles with congruent or opposite valence at the same time. Hence, future research may investigate users' intention to share when they are exposed to multiple online health articles. Moreover, the sample size of our research was relatively small (n = 80). Although prior research using a lab experiment with a between-participants design suggests that sample size of each treatment group should be larger than 18 (ours is 20 for each treatment group) (see Qiu et al., 2012) , we hope future work to enlarge the sample size and strengthen the reliability of our results.",

However, it is also interesting to do further investigations to improve generalizability in the following three ways. First, future studies may recruit young Chinese people from diverse sources, such as those from local factories and rural China as future research participants. These young people tend to be less educated and thus have relatively low eHealth literacy. The role of confirmation bias in their sharing intention could differ from those university students. Second, future studies may target other groups of social media users, such as older adults. Because older adults seem to have more health-related issues, and such health conditions might confound the role of confirmation bias. Third, future studies ought to conduct cross-cultural studies to validate the findings of this study. One significant direction could be a comparison of the role of confirmation bias in sharing online health articles between Chinese social media and non-Chinese ones.",

However, enhancing users' intention to share health articles is tricky as the sharing intention differs in their eHealth literacy and the content valence of the articles that they read. This study investigates the boundary conditions under which eHealth literacy and content valence can promote users' intention to share by introducing a moderating factor: confirmation bias. This study concludes that for users with a high level of eHealth literacy, their intention to share health articles could be promoted in two conditions: (1) if their confirmation bias holds extreme, the providers may edit positive health articles for them; (2) if they have moderate confirmation bias or no confirmation bias, the providers may edit negative health articles for them. In contrast, for users with a low level of eHealth literacy, only when they have moderate positive confirmation bias, their intention to share is enhanced regardless of providing positive or negative health articles.
