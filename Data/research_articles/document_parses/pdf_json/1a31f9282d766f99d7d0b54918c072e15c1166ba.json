In vitro transcription RNA from pSVOK 12 transfected IBRS-2 cells and the recovered virus RNA were isolated and sequenced, then indirect hemagglutination test, indirect immunofluorescence assays, eleectron microscope test, 50% tissue culture infecting dose (TCID 50 ) assays and mouse virulence studies were performed to study the antigenicity and virulence of the recovered virus. The result showed that the infectious clones we obtained and the virus derived from pSVOK 12 had the same biological properties as the parental strain HK/70. The full-length infectious cDNA clone, pSVOK 12 , will be very useful in studies of the antigenicity, virulence, pathogenesis, maturation and replication of SVDV.",

            "text": "Swine vesicular disease (SVD) is a highly contagious viral disease of pigs. Symptoms are clinically indistinguishable from those caused by other vesicular disease viruses, such as foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus, vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus and vesiviruses (which include vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV)), so SVD is classified as a list A disease by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) [1] . The causative agent, swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), is a member of the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. It is a non-enveloped virus, containing a single-strand RNA genome of positive sense which is approximately 7.4 kb nucleotides in length [2, 3] with a poly (A) tail at the 3\u2032 end, and can act directly as messenger RNA in host cells. SVDV is both antigenically and genetically closely related to the human pathogen coxsackievirus B5 (CV-B5) [4] [5] [6] [7] , although pigs inoculated with CV-B5 do not show overt clinical signs of SVD [8] . It is possible that SVDV have potential harm to the human health. For example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbroke in 2002-2003 in southern China. It has been already reported that species of bats are natural host of coronavirus closely related to those responsible for SARS outbreak [9] . We also should attach importance to the questions of interspecific barrier and origin of the etiological agent, SVDV (or CV-B5), to prevent and control future outbreaks of SVDV or CV-B5.",

Subsequent report came from the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In 2003/4, clinical outbreaks of SVD were only reported in Portugal, while subclinical infection was continuously detected in Southern Italy [1] . Outbreaks continue to occur in Italy and the disease is thought still to be present in China including Hong Kong region, and possibly other countries in Asia [11] . Once introduced, SVD can be a disease difficult to eradicate, and improved methods of control would be highly beneficial.",

Full-length infectious cDNA constructs of the RNA genome of poliovirus were first described by Racaniello and Baltimore [12] . From then on, several infectious cDNAs corresponding to the genomes of Picornaviruses have been constructed [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , which make it possible to apply the technique of in vitro mutagenesis, known as reverse genetics, to the analysis of viral function and the development of recombinant vaccines. Poliovirus, like SVDV, a member of the genus enterovirus, has been successfully controlled using the live attenuated Sabin vaccines [16] . Analogically, it might therefore be possible to get a live attenuated vaccine for SVD. Three infectious cDNA clones of SVDV have been established, but these cDNA clones were based on H/3\u203276 [17] , J\u203273 [11] and NET/1/92 [18] . J1\u203273 and H/3\u203276 were isolated from Japan, and NET/1/92 was isolated from Netherlands. To date, there is no report available about infectious cDNA clones of some SVDV isolated from China. In order to understand the mechanisms of molecular pathology of SVDV and develop effective vaccines, we have achieved an infectious clone of SVDV HK/70 strain.",

By the reverse genetics, we can understand the mechanisms of molecular pa- thology and immunology of the virus. Moreover, these clones can also be considered as \"pool\" to develop recombinant vaccines and other effective vaccines. Since the first infectious cDNA clone of poliovirus [12] was constructed, many cDNA copies from RNA genomes of members of the Picornaviridae have been obtained. For example, full-length cDNA copies constructed from two Japanese SVDV strains (J1\u203273 and H/3\u203276) [11, 17] were used to study virulence differences between the two strains [20] . A full-length cDNA clone of the European SVDV NET/1/92 strain isolated in the 1990s [18] was also constructed. SVDV strains significantly differ from the Japanese strains at the genetic and antigenic level. Based on the monoclonal antibody (MAb) reaction pattern, SVDV NET/1/92 was classified into group IV together with all other SVDV strains isolated in Europe from 1992 to 1995 [21] . The epitopes of newly prepared monoclonal antibodies were roughly mapped by fusion-PCR. Fine mapping of epitopes at the amino acid level was achieved by introducing single amino acid mutations in the genome of strain. Two new important amino acids in epitope formation were located in VP1; one was mapped in the C-terminal end and the other was thought to be located in the H-I loop [22] .",
