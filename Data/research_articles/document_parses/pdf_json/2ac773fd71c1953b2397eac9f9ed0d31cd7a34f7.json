            "text": "Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an increasingly common intervention in the treatment of pancreaticobiliary disorders. Patients are often elderly with complex co-morbidities. While monitored anaesthesia care with sedation is commonly used for most cases, few would require general anaesthesia with an endotracheal tube. Both low-flow and high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) are established ways of delivering supplemental oxygen, but it is unclear whether one technique is better than the other. HFNC seems a promising tool for advanced procedures but evidence to support its application in high-risk ERCP cases is limited. The rate of oxygen desaturation during endoscopy has been reported to be as high as 11%-50% and the method of oxygen delivery for ERCP merits further study. Methods/design: This is a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial comparing the efficacy of oxygen supplementation through HFNC versus low-flow nasal cannula during ERCP, in a cohort of patients at risk of adverse respiratory events. A total of 132 patients will be recruited across three sites and randomly assigned to either the low-flow or the HFNC group. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients experiencing hypoxia, defined by any event of SpO2 < 90%. The secondary outcomes include parameters centred on oxygenation, requirement of airway manoeuvres, successful completion of procedure, perioperative complications, patient satisfaction and cost analysis of the consumables. An intention-to-treat principle will be applied while analysing.",

There are several difficulties for the anaesthetist to deal with. It is generally performed in a prone or lateral position under moderate to deep sedation or general anaesthesia [1] [2] [3] . In most hospitals, ERCP is usually performed outside the operating room. The patients who require this procedure are typically elderly with significant comorbidities. General anaesthesia with an endotracheal tube may be a 'safe option' in the prone position in terms of having a secured airway and a lower ERCP failure rate [3] ; there may be a reduction in complication rates, but intubation has drawbacks. In addition to the well-known problems associated with insertion of the tube, managing a paralysed intubated patient prone creates its own challenges. Note that there is frequently a prolongation of anaesthetic time concurrent with the use of muscle relaxants.",

            "text": "Deep sedation using propofol is perhaps the most commonly employed technique for ERCPs. ERCP generally requires a deeper level of sedation compared to simple gastroscopy and there is an increased risk of both partial and complete airway obstruction. The goals of deep sedation are: preserving adequate spontaneous ventilation; maintaining cardio-respiratory stability; early recovery; and minimising any hypoxaemia at all times. Hypoxemia and aspiration have occurred when these procedures have been performed under deep sedation, especially in high-risk cases [4] . Reasons for desaturation during ERCP under deep sedation have been attributed to reduced cardiopulmonary reserve, advanced age, respiratory depression, duration of the procedure, and prone positioning. The incidence of hypoxemia during any endoscopic procedure is in the range of 11%-50% [5] [6] [7] and it is possibly as high as 60% with ERCP [8] (definitions of hypoxia vary between the studies). Prolonged hypoxia is a major risk factor for periprocedural cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia [9] [10] [11] . Any methods of avoiding such occurrences is worthy of investigation.",

Conventionally, it is delivered via nasal prongs and/or an extension tubing attached to the mouth guard (the application of the endoscope in the oral cavity precludes the use of normal face masks). The recommended flow rate through the low flow nasal cannula is 2-4 L/ min, while the inspired FIO 2 (fractional inspired oxygen concentration) is dependent on the ventilatory minute volume, in the range of 0.27-0.50 [12, 13] . Patients with high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status (III) [5, 14] , high body mass index (BMI) [5, 15] and those with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) [16] are especially at an increased risk of hypoxia during advanced endoscopic procedures such as ERCP; these patients will obtain most benefit from any improvement in oxygenation techniques. It has been the case that superior oxygen delivery options preserving spontaneous respiration without interfering with the pharyngeal cavity have been limited for these procedures.",

It has been demonstrated to provide better oxygenation compared to the venturi face mask and low-flow nasal cannula during intravenous sedation for both bronchoscopy and dental procedures [17, 18] . HFNC can provide a maximum flow up to 70 L/min and delivers a flow-dependent positive airway pressure which increases end-expiratory lung volume and thereby improves oxygenation [19] . It has numerous physiological advantages that are not possible through standard (ventilation dependent) low-flow delivery systems. These advantages include the ability to create PEEP (up to 5-7.5 cm H 2 0), reduce the work of breathing, provide constant FIO 2 up to 100%, provide good humidification, and aid washout of the pharyngeal dead space [19, 20] . In one centre, introducing the option to use HFNC affected anaesthetic practice and decreased the usage of general anaesthesia with an endotracheal tube (for a mixed group of ERCP and endobronchial ultrasound procedures) [21] . This observational study also showed HFNC also decreased the anaesthesia only time.",

It has been successfully employed in various perioperative settings such as preoxygenation and airway management, including awake intubation [22, 23] . In our own institution, we have used HFNC for endoscopy and ERCP procedures in high-risk cases and have found it convenient to use and frequently beneficial. Being administered nasally, there is nil interference with the endoscopic insertion and manipulation in the oropharynx.",
