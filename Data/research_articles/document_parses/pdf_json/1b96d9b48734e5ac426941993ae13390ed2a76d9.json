Recently, the role of APN as a receptor for PEDV has been questioned. In our study, the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infections was studied in primary porcine enterocytes. After seven days of cultivation, 89% of enterocytes presented microvilli and showed a two-to five-fold higher susceptibility to PEDV and TGEV. A significant increase of PEDV and TGEV infection was correlated with a higher expression of APN, which was indicative that APN plays an important role in porcine coronavirus infections. However, PEDV and TGEV infected both APN positive and negative enterocytes. PEDV and TGEV Miller showed a higher infectivity in APN positive cells than in APN negative cells. In contrast, TGEV Purdue replicated better in APN negative cells. These results show that an additional receptor exists, different from APN for porcine coronaviruses. Subsequently, treatment of enterocytes with neuraminidase (NA) had no effect on infection efficiency of TGEV, implying that terminal cellular sialic acids (SAs) are no receptor determinants for TGEV. Treatment of TGEV with NA significantly enhanced the infection which shows that TGEV is masked by SAs.",

It is known that the peripheral S1 portion is a globular cellular receptor binding subunit while the transmembrane S2 portion is required to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes [1] . The S protein also contains important antigenic determinants for coronaviruses. The triple-spanning M protein has a short N-terminal glycosylated domain, a long C-terminal domain, and three transmembrane domains [2] . M proteins play key roles in virion assembly/budding. The lateral interactions between M and E proteins are supposed to mediate the formation of the virion envelope. The M-S protein interactions are also needed to retain the spike proteins at the budding site, incorporating the S proteins into the viral envelope [3] . The E protein is a small hydrophobic protein of 9-12 kDa. It plays crucial roles during virus budding and transiently localizes at the pre-Golgi compartment before progressing to the Golgi apparatus. Deletion of the E protein in TGEV arrests virus transportation and maturation [4] . The E protein possesses an ion channel activity, contributing to virus virulence and pathogenesis [5] .",

            "text": "The replication of viruses in their host cells is firstly mediated by the virus binding to the cellular receptors. Some Alphacoronaviruses, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), TGEV, and PEDV, may use aminopeptidase N (APN) as a cellular receptor [6-10]. APN is a type II cell membrane metalloprotease, that is linked to cells by its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It is highly abundant on the brush border membrane of the mature small intestinal enterocytes, kidney, and liver epithelial cells. APN is highly species specific. Human coronaviruses cannot recognize porcine APN as a cellular receptor because of certain differences in glycosylation regions [11] . APN has been identified as a major receptor for TGEV, as it has been shown that TGEV virions are able to specifically bind to purified APN and conferred the infectivity of TGEV to a non-permissive cell line when the cells were expressing recombinant APN [7] . An interaction between APN and PEDV infection has also been demonstrated. Transient expression of APN in Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells conferred susceptibility of these cells to PEDV infection and the infection was inhibited by anti-APN polyclonal antibodies [9] . Cong and colleagues demonstrated that APN mediates PEDV infection in Vero E6 and in an immortalized porcine enteric cell line [12] . However, increasingly more data demonstrates that APN is not essential for PEDV infection, because PEDV exhibits no binding to soluble APN [13, 14] . Moreover, Vero cells are commonly used for PEDV propagation and cultivation in vitro. The endogenous expression of APN in Vero cells was undetectable in the mRNA and the protein levels, which challenges the role of APN as a cellular receptor for PEDV. Therefore, whether APN is a functional receptor for PEDV is disputable. However, no data are available on the role of APN in primary enterocytes.",

Sialic acids are electronegatively charged monosaccharides in animals and some microorganisms. They are prominently positioned at the outer end of N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipids. TGEV shows a hemagglutinating activity with \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acids on the erythrocyte surface as target. Among different types of sialic acids, N-glycolylneuraminic acid was recognized by TGEV more efficiently than N-acetylneuraminic acid [15] . Sialic acid binding by TGEV is not essential in the initiation of infection of cultured cells, as TGEV mutants lacking sialic acid binding activity can be propagated to the same extent in cultured cells [15] . However, sialic acid binding activity is important for the enteropathogenicity of TGEV. Mutants without sialic acid binding were not capable of initiating intestinal infection in vivo, showing that sialic acid binding is required for efficient intestinal infections [17] . This sialic acid binding activity of TGEV is supposed to help the virus to penetrate the mucus layer and to infect intestinal epithelial cells. PEDV is also able to bind sialic acids. PEDV S1 protein was reported to bind bovine and porcine mucins that contain a mixture of different types of sugar [16, 18] . Furthermore, Neu5Ac was identified as the most favored binding sugar of PEDV S1 by a glycan array screen [16] . Different from the APN binding domain in the C-terminal of PEDV S1 (residues 477-629), the sialic acid binding domain was reported in the N-terminal of PEDV S1 (residues 1-320) [18] .",

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and its variant porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are classified as Alphacoronavirus. They are enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28.5 kb. The positive ssRNA serves as mRNA for the generation of viral replicative proteins by translation of open reading frame (ORF) 1a and ORF1b. The genome contains a 5 untranslated region (UTR), a 3 UTR, and at least seven ORFs. ORF1a and ORF1b make up two-thirds of the viral genome and encode the non-structural replicase polyproteins (replicases 1a and 1b), which further guide the viral replication and translation, regulate cellular processes, and potentially fulfill other unknown functions. The remaining proximal third of the genome encodes four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) by ORF2, ORF4, ORF5, and ORF6, respectively). The S protein is a type I glycoprotein that projects from the virions surface forming In the present study, the co-culture system of primary porcine enterocytes that was established in our laboratory was used to study the role of APN in PEDV and TGEV infection in their target cells [19] . Further, it was investigated whether sialic acids are cellular receptors for TGEV in primary enterocytes.",

PEDV CV777 fecal suspension was collected from a three-day-old infected suckling piglet. A twenty percent fecal suspension was prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1000 U/mL penicillin (Continental Pharma, Puurs, Belgium), 1 mg/mL streptomycin (Certa, Braine l'Alleud, Belgium), 1 mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco BRL, Merelbeke, Belgium), and 0.01% v/v fungizone (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Braine l'Alleud, Belgium). Hydrocortisone, spermidine, and Wnt agonist were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma, St-Louis, Mo, USA). Porcine insulin was purchased from Protein specialists (ProSpec, Rehovot, Israel). The small intestinal contents (IC) were collected from the duodenum of a three-day-old suckling piglet. After euthanasia, a 20 cm long segment of duodenum was closed by two surgical clamps and was removed from a piglet. Then, one clamp was removed and the intestinal contents were released from the lumen into a 15 mL centrifugation tube. In order to collect all the intestinal contents, the lumen was washed once by filling it with 5 mL Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1000 U/mL penicillin, 1 mg/mL streptomycin, 1 mg/mL gentamicin, and 0.01% v/v fungizone. Then, the DMEM was released from the lumen into the 15 mL tube that already contained the intestinal contents. After centrifugation (1200 rpm, 10 min at 4 \u2022 C), the supernatant of the intestinal contents was collected and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C until use.",

            "text": "The epithelium of the small intestines is continuously and rapidly renewed in a process involving cell generation and migration from the multi-potent stem cells in the crypts to the differentiated cells at the tips of the villi within 2-3 days. In our study, after three days cultivation, the primary enterocytes were positive for sucrase and iso-maltase, which are considered as differentiation markers for epithelial cells [19] . However, the expression of aminopeptidase N was only around 11%, indicating that the primary enterocytes are not fully mature at three days cultivation. Therefore, we analyzed APN expression in enterocytes at a later time point (seven days cultivation). A significantly higher expression of APN was detected at seven days cultivation compared to three days cultivation. Interestingly, the seven-day-cultured enterocytes with a higher APN expression showed significantly higher infection to TGEV than that of enterocytes cultured for three days. This agrees with the fact that the virus mainly infects and destroys mature enterocytes lining the villi of small intestines [23] . However, the infection efficiency of PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells was still low, indicating that other factors than APN need to be considered for PEDV infection. Therefore, several positive enterocyte differentiation factors were tested. Hydrocortisone plays an important role in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, and is a known promoter for differentiation of cultured cells. Hydrocortisone was found to be a critical factor for the differentiation of skeletal muscle, osteoblasts, and endothelial cells [24] . Sorrell and colleagues demonstrated that hydrocortisone significantly upregulated the expression of APN in human dermal fibroblasts [25] . Besides, Wnt signaling is required for the formation of normal crypt-villus units of intestines, and stimulates the differentiation of intestinal secretory epithelial cells [26] . Activated Wnt signaling has also been shown to promote mesenchymal differentiation [27] . The original rationale for including intestinal contents in our primary cell cultures was trying to mimic the in vivo situation in the intestinal tract. Intestinal contents contain a large number of enzymes, such as: Amylase, which digests carbohydrates to monosaccharides; pancreatic enzymes, which digest proteins into amino acids; and lipase which digests fats. It has been demonstrated that intestinal contents play an important role in virus infection. The proteases (trypsin) in the intestinal contents activate rotavirus infection by cleaving the outer capsid protein VP4 [28] . The propagation of porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC) on a cell line critically relies on the presence of intestinal contents in the culture medium [29] . Chang et al. demonstrated that the bile salts in intestinal contents are essential for growth of PEC by inducing the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway [30] . In our study, the intestinal contents collected from the upper duodenum promoted the expression of APN and enhanced the infection of both TGEV and PEDV, especially the CV777 Vero adapted strain. Further investigation is needed to determine which growth-promoting factor in the intestinal contents is responsible for the increase of coronavirus infection.",

            "text": "To date, coronaviruses use four different proteins as cellular receptors. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) initiates the infection by binding to the carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocyte membranes and intestinal brush border membranes [31] . Next, APN was found to act as a receptor for porcine, feline, canine, and human coronaviruses [6] . The receptors for the highly pathogenic human respiratory viruses SARS-CoV type 1 and type 2 as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) [32, 33] . Cong and colleagues proved that the porcine small intestine epithelial cell line was more susceptible to PEDV when a high expression level of APN was present, and that interference with APN expression in epithelial cells inhibited PEDV infection, demonstrating that APN serves as an essential receptor for PEDV [12] . In addition, a transgenic mouse model expressing porcine APN was proven to be susceptible to PEDV, which confirmed that APN plays a role as the cellular receptor for PEDV [34] . In our study, we found that the higher infection of PEDV in enterocytes is correlated with higher APN expression. Both aged enterocytes and enterocytes treated with differentiation factors expressed more APN and were more susceptible to PEDV, which indicates that APN may play role in PEDV infection in enterocytes. Moreover, we found that the APN was expressed at the apical surface of enterocytes and PEDV infected 40 times more enterocytes at the apical surface than at the basolateral surface (supplementary Figure S1 ). These results were in agreement with the previous finding that PEDV enters polarized cells via the apical membrane [12] . Our results indicate that APN facilitates the entry of PEDV into primary enterocytes. Shirato and colleagues indicated that APN may promote PEDV replication in porcine kidney cell line, CPK cells via its protease activity [14] . How APN facilitates PEDV infection in enterocytes should be further investigated. However, due to the fact that other molecules besides APN will also be expressed at the apical plasma membrane during differentiation, they may also contribute to the higher susceptibility of differentiated enterocytes. Recently, increasingly more data has been published that show that APN is not a cellular receptor for PEDV. Overexpression of APN in non-susceptible cells did not confer susceptibility of the cells to PEDV and knocking out APN in susceptible cells did not abrogate PEDV infection, which indicates that APN is not required as a cellular receptor for PEDV in vitro [13, 14, 22] . Furthermore, APN knockout pigs retained their susceptibility to PEDV confirming that PEDV may use another additional receptor in pigs [35] . In agreement with these findings, we found that PEDV can infect APN negative primary enterocytes, which further confirmed that a cellular receptor different from APN exists in enterocytes for PEDV replication. The primary enterocytes isolated and cultured in our study are not 100% positive for APN, as we not only get the villi epithelial cells, but also the crypt epithelial cells during our isolation procedure. By immunofluorescence staining of ileum tissue of a three-day-old piglet, we observed that the villi epithelial cells are APN positive, while the crypt epithelial cells are APN negative (data not shown). As PEDV has been shown to infect goblet cells and crypt stem cells in addition to villous mature enterocytes [36] , we believe that PEDV may also use another cellular receptor besides APN to infect intestinal cells. Taken together, our results indicate that although APN could significantly promote PEDV infection in enterocytes, an additional cellular receptor exists in enterocytes for PEDV replication. Since ACE2 is expressed in the gut epithelial cells, it will be tested in the near future if it can function as a PEDV receptor.",

            "text": "In addition to PEDV, APN has been identified as a major cellular receptor for TGEV. In the present study, it was shown that a higher expression of APN significantly increased the replication of TGEV in enterocytes, indicating that APN plays an important role as a cellular receptor for TGEV. Whitworth and colleagues demonstrated that APN knockout pigs were resistant to TGEV infection, indicating that APN is the sole functional receptor for TGEV [35] . However, we found that except APN positive enterocytes, TGEV could also infect APN negative enterocytes, suggesting that an additional receptor also exists in enterocytes for TGEV. The result obtained in our in vitro experiment may not fully reflect the in vivo experiments, as the in vivo situation is composed of a complex set of cells and tissues. The Purdue strain used in our study has been passaged 114 times in primary kidney cells and a nucleotide mutation (T to G at nucleotide position 1753), which causes a serine (S) to alanine (A) at aa 585 [37, 38] . This mutation may be correlated with the cell adaptation and also it may result in a broader cell tropism of the adapted strain, which may explain that the virus is able to grow more efficiently in APN negative cells. Purdue has been proven to infect primary colon epithelial cells and porcine myofibroblasts, which are both negative for APN [19] . In vivo, TGEV shows a higher cell tropism to villous enterocytes of newborn piglets compared to older pigs and causes only high mortality in the early life of piglets. Since APN is present on enterocytes from both newborn and older pigs, the age-dependent susceptibility to TGEV infection may be caused by an additional receptor that is specifically present in newborn piglets. Taken together, we hypothesize that APN is the determinant cellular receptor for TGEV, but an additional receptor exists in young piglets. Apart from APN, TGEV also uses SA as an attachment mediator on the cells. Shahwan and colleagues have shown that NA treatment of jejunum epithelial cryosections did not reduce the TGEV Spike protein binding in vitro and were doubting on the role of SA during infection [39] . In our study, removal of SA from intestinal cells had no effect on TGEV infection, showing that terminal SA residues are not receptor determinants for TGEV. Removal of SA from TGEV virions significantly enhanced the viral infectivity in vitro. This indicates that SA on the virion surface masks the binding site of the viral protein to cellular receptors. Removal of SA from virions facilitates TGEV to bind to its functional receptor on the enterocyte membrane. To confirm the role of APN and SA in TGEV infection in primary enterocytes, a binding assay was performed in this study. The results demonstrated that both TGEV Miller and Purdue could bind to APN positive and SA positive cells. Meanwhile, Miller and Purdue could also bind to APN negative and SA negative enterocytes. Furthermore, our study showed that APN and SA double-negative enterocytes could be infected by TGEV Miller and Purdue (supplementary Figure S2) , which suggests that besides APN and SA, TGEV can use another cellular receptor for the replication in enterocytes. Further investigation will focus on identifying this unknow receptor. A binding assay for PEDV could not be conducted due to the low titer of the virus stock.",

When cells were pretreated with intestinal contents, 9 \u00b1 6 cells were infected. For TGEV Miller, incubation with intestinal contents, porcine insulin, and Wnt agonist significantly increased the virus infection from 1.0 \u00b1 0.3% to 3.6 \u00b1 0.9%, 3.2 \u00b1 0.9% and 3.0 \u00b1 0.5%, respectively. Hydrocortisone and spermidine increased the virus infection to 2.7 \u00b1 0.5% and 2.5 \u00b1 0.6%(Figure 3). The results show that pretreatment of primary enterocytes with hydrocortisone, spermidine, porcine insulin, Wnt agonist, and intestinal contents could stimulate the expression of APN and enhance the infection of PEDV CV777 Vero adapted and non-adapted strains and the TGEV Miller in the enterocytes.",
