Funding recipients data were obtained through cross-checking information from funding mechanism websites and the French national company registry where companies' financial statements are available. Financial information was frequently missing, specifically for newly created companies which are the targeted recipients of numerous funding mechanisms. Data collected had a significant number of missing features. Moreover, most funding mechanisms did not communicate on their recipients, especially for small funding mechanisms. As such, available funding recipient data were strongly biased towards well-known funding mechanisms. Supervised learning on data with these limitations would have easily led to overfitting. These limitations were avoided using unsupervised learning and another larger dataset of French companies obtained using a proprietary software. This other dataset was representative of all French companies and suffered from fewer missing data.",

Linear dimension reduction algorithms, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA), strive to preserve global input data structure but describe poorly the true geometry of nonlinear data [7] . In this study, former funding recipient and representative populations had similar spatial distributions in the low-dimensional space, hence PCA was unable to isolate the target population from the representative population. Nonlinear dimension reduction algorithms, also referred to as manifold learning algorithms, can describe a wider range of variable interactions [14] . They are usually divided into two categories based on whether they focus on local or global data structure preservation. Global nonlinear dimension reduction algorithms such as Kernel PCA [10] or Isometric feature Mapping (ISOMAP) [17] strive to preserve input data geometry at all scales: neighborhood and remoteness are preserved between the input and output spaces. Local nonlinear dimension reduction algorithms such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [11] or t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [8] focus primarily on local geometry preservation in small neighborhoods of the manifold [14] . Recently developed, UMAP [9] falls into this last category. The local approach has two advantages over the global approach: first, lower computational complexity as computations involve sparse matrix manipulation, second, an enhanced ability to represent a wider range of manifolds, specifically when geometry is Euclidean at a local scale but is non-Euclidean at a global scale. t-SNE has proven to balance well local and global data structures on real life data giving t-SNE a competitive edge. This was not the case for LLE and its other nonlinear counterparts [8] . But t-SNE suffers from several drawbacks [13, 18] , which do not affect UMAP, such as:",

Features selected for this study were limited to turnover, net income, equity and headcount over a threeyear period. Data were not processed as time-series. Feature selection was based upon finElink's use case: information asked to users needed to be easily available to improve user-friendliness.

Business sector and location were categorized with respectively NACE codes and region names.

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) [12] is another multiple imputation method based on regression. Both MICE and MissForest deal with mixed data types (categorical and/or continuous). However, MissForest is non-parametric and, as such, can handle non-linearity and variable interactions in data, which MICE cannot. Initial missing data rates were 58% and 34% for respectively the target and representative populations. Given the high missing data rates, data imputation on the overall available population would have been inappropriate.

The initial modeling step depends on whether the algorithm should focus on preserving the local or global input data structure.

In DBSCAN, cluster identification is carried out by assessing the neighborhood density of each sample, i.e. evaluating the number of neighbors within an radius of that sample. Provided the number of neighbors is above the user-defined threshold, that sample is said to be a cluster core point. If the sample does not have enough neighbors within an radius while having at least one core point as a neighbor, then that point is assigned to the core point's cluster. Otherwise, that point is labeled as noise. Projections from the target population were fed into DBSCAN to isolate the projection space area with a high density of target population samples. The remaining samples were labeled as noise. DBSCAN tuning led to the following setup:",

Output dimension analysis, as commonly performed for PCA, cannot be carried out. Nonetheless, analysis of input feature distribution in the UMAP projection space is an alternative as it gives a broad overview of variable importance with regard to the projection. Plot analysis can help identify strong correlations between projections and input features. This was the case for turnover and headcount variables for year N-1, presented in respectively Fig. 1a and Fig. 1c . These variables appeared to have an impact on the overall data projection pattern. Net income and equity variables did not show a high degree of correlation with the projection, as shown respectively in Fig. 1b and Fig. 1d , as feature distribution appeared to be random in some projection space areas. Results were plotted for year N-1, but the patterns were similar for the two other years (N-2 and N-3). Turnover and headcount appeared to be the variables that mattered the most distance-wise in the output space. Net income and equity, which showed a weaker or limited impact on the overall UMAP projection distribution, might have had a more local impact distance-wise in the output space.",

Distribution patterns for funding recipients were different from those observed for the representative population as shown in Fig. 2a . Funding recipients were prone to concentrate primarily in the left region of the projection in the shape of a curve. The curve went from the projection's upper left side to the lower center region, in the shape of a \"backbone\". Projection space division into a grid, presented in Fig. 1b , helped understand the projection space density distribution. Density analysis confirmed the shape identification. Funding recipient samples were mainly located within the \"backbone\" shape as 74% of funding recipients belonged to it (i.e. 1,041 out of the 1,413 funding recipient samples). Funding recipient concentration within a specific projection space area confirmed that our similarity-based approach on financial features for potential funding recipient identification was relevant. DBSCAN was then applied on the target population and its main cluster was identified. The remaining funding recipients were labeled as noise. Company samples from the representative population that were within an radius of cluster core points were labeled potential funding recipients as shown in Fig. 2c . Membership to the main cluster was fed into the recommendation system and potential funding recipients were suggested more competitive funding mechanisms.",

Combining a novel non-linear dimension reduction method with a density-based clustering algorithm proved to be most instructive. Similarity was assessed using a limited set of financial features: turnover, net income, headcount and equity over a period of three fiscal years. Our approach can be summarized in three stages. First, representative company data were projected onto a lowdimensional space using the manifold learning algorithm UMAP. Second, former funding recipient data were projected onto that same low-dimensional space. Third, the cluster with the highest density of former funding recipients was identified using the density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN. Companies close to that cluster, either from the representative company dataset or newly added from a finElink user, were separated from the rest. They were deemed to be more successful than their counterparts. Finelink suggestions were personalized to companies' financial information as companies with higher chances of success were proposed the most competitive funding mechanisms while the others were offered smaller funding mechanisms. Further recommendation system tuning includes analyzing funding recipients from mechanisms with similar characteristics in order to identify distribution patterns specific to these sub-groups. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other contexts for minority population identification within a larger population sample when facing strong data constraints. Notwithstanding significant data sparsity, bias and missing data constraints, we have demonstrated that combining non-linear dimension reduction with density-based clustering, important correlations can be unraveled.",
