By effective triaging, transitioning to teledermatology consultations, restructuring the workplace and by implementing strict handwashing/wearing of face masks dermatology patients can be seen in an outpatient setting whilst minimizing the risk of virus transmission.",

Currently no specific video conferencing software has been legislated. The traditional set up with the patient video-conferencing the specialist at a GP practice is time consuming and less efficient due to issues with the software, network connection and punctuality of all parties. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients with referrals from general practitioners can access teledermatology directly with specialists. This is more flexible and reliable.",

To prevent occupational skin diseases after repeated hand washing, use of a barrier cream or emollient after hand sanitization is recommended by a Cochrane Review on interventions for prevention occupational hand dermatitis. 3 If dermoscopy is required the site should be cleaned with an alcohol wipe and the dermatoscope should be cleaned for one minute prior. 4 Disposable dermoscopic lens covers are also available or polyvinyl chloric (PVC) cling film wrap can also be placed between the dermatoscope lens and lesion. 5 Other non-touch dermoscopic techniques have also been proposed that patients can do at home such as placing a drop of immersion fluid (i.e olive oil) and taking an enlarged photograph an a mobile phone or digital camera. 6",
