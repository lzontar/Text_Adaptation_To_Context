Patients with rheumatic diseases are known to be at higher risk of infection because of immune dysregulation, comorbidities, and immune-modulating treatments 3-5. Many of these diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) affect patients of an older age on average 6. Beyond the typical challenges of self-managing a chronic disease, disease management has become significantly more complex with the implementation of social distancing, including limiting nonessential health care visits. This has led to confusion about how patients with rheumatic diseases should balance managing their disease and reducing their risk of infection 7,8. In addition, there were early reports that treatments typically used for rheumatic diseases might be effective against COVID- 19 9 . Most notably, in vitro studies and a small cohort study reported that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) showed some benefits in treating COVID-19 10-12. HCQ is a commonly used conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that reduces flares and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus and is a common treatment for RA and other rheumatic diseases, In a small case-series, the interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor tocilizumab, a biologic DMARD, also showed promise for treating respiratory manifestations related to COVID- 19 13. There are several ongoing clinical trials examining the use of tocilizumab or sarilumab as treatment for COVID- 19 14. These early reports and the emergency authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of HCQ as a treatment for COVID- 19 have led to critical shortages in medication availability during a time when regular access to medication is inherently more difficult 15 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "7,8.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1007, "text": "19 9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1538, "text": "19 13.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1651, "end": 1657, "text": "19 14.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1787, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1923, "end": 1925, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The objective of this study was to understand how patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases in the United States have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through a onetime COVID-19 questionnaire querying their experiences during the last 2 weeks of March 2020.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The study population consisted of participants in FORWARD, The National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases, a longitudinal open-enrollment observational patient registry 16.

This belief seemed to stem from previous experiences of being instructed to stop immunosuppressive medications during infections or before surgeries.
