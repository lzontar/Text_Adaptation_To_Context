(1) on their important publication (March 2020) reporting a high incidence of digestive symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection among 204 patients hospitalized, between January and February 2020 at 3 Chinese hospitals, of whom 29 patients (14.2%) had diarrhea as their chief complaint. They associated the presence of any digestive symptom (anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain) with higher COVID-19 mortality but did not quantify the diarrhea and did not investigate the pathophysiology of morbidity/mortality from diarrhea. Although pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are well recognized, diarrhea is insufficiently characterized. A novel case is reported of moderately severe COVID-19 associated diarrhea that produced electrolyte derangements, dehydration, and likely prerenal kidney injury.",

Medical history included chronically taking rivaroxaban for prior transverse sinus thrombosis; no history of alcoholism, drug abuse, recent travel, or antibiotic use; and no known pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or liver diseases. Patient had diabetes mellitus treated with metformin, hypertension treated with metoprolol, and untreated hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia, probably all from metabolic syndrome associated with severe obesity (body mass index 5 37 kg/m 2 ). Patient was potentially exposed to COVID-19 from working as a nurse's aid. She had been vaccinated against influenza 4 months earlier.",
