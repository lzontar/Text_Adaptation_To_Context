The two polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into mature 45 nonstructural proteins (nsps) by ORF1a-encoded proteases including nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, 46 nsp2, and nsp4 (1, 10, 11). Nsp1 and nsp2 are involved in the cleavage at nsp1/2 and nsp2/3 sites, respectively, while nsp4 is responsible for the cleavage of the remaining 48 nsps (12, 13). Nsp4, a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP), plays a significant role in the 49 processing of pp1a and pp1ab to release nsp3 to nsp12 from pp1a/ab (14, 15). and D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Asp185 regulates the capacity of 124 nsp4 to cleave VISA and NEMO. 125 The structure of residue Asp185 in nsp4 might play a role in keeping its 3CLSP 126 activity. 127 Nsp4 is a 3C-like serine protease, which is responsible for most of the 128 nonstructural protein processing including nsp3'4 and nsp11'12 in PRRSV replication 129 (30). We then investigated whether the protease activity alteration in nsp4 was 130 associated with Asp185 mutation. To verify the 3CLSP activity of nsp4, we first 131 generated fusion proteins nsp3'4(S118Y) and nsp11'12, which were used as 132 substrates (25, 32). The nsp3'4(S118Y) substrate contains the last 8 amino acids of 133 nsp3 and the whole amino acids of nsp4, which has a mutated Ser118 to disrupt its 134 3CLSP activity to avoid self-cleaving. The nsp11'12 substrate contains the whole 135 amino acids of both nsp11 and nsp12. As expected, nsp4 with Ala185 mutation did 136 not cleave the substrates, implying that replacing Asp185 with Ala impaired its 137 protease activities ( Fig. 3A-B) . To further clarify how residue Asp185 regulates the 138 3CLSP activity, we first generated a nsp4 mutant (nsp4-D185E) by replacing Asp185 139 with a negatively charged amino acid Glutamate185 (Glu, E) or a mutant 140 (nsp4-D185K) by replacing Asp185 with a positively charged amino acid Lysine185 141 (Lys, K). We then transfected each of the vectors into Hela cells along with nsp11'12 142 expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 3C , both nsp4-D185E and nsp4-D185K did not 143 cleave nsp11'12, suggesting that the charge of the residue 185 is not a key factor in 144 affecting the protease activity of nsp4. Next, to explore if the size of residue 185 in 145 nsp4 plays a role in regulating its 3CLSP activity, we made nsp4 mutants with 146 Serine185 (Ser, S) and Cysteine185 (Cys, C), which have similar sizes with aspartic 147 acid. Similarly, nsp4-D185C and nsp4-D185S did not cleave nsp11'12 ( Fig. 3D) , 148 implying that the amino acid size of residue 185 in nsp4 is also not a key factor in 149 keeping its protease activity. Then, to investigate whether the residue structure at 150 position 185 in nsp4 plays a role in keeping its protease activity, we replaced nsp4 Nsp4 with Asn185 substitution reduces its protease activity. 157 Considering that nsp4-D185N can cleave the optimal substrates, we next 158 performed experiments to examine the proteolytic activity of nsp4-D185N in vitro. 159 Previous study shows that pET32a-nsp3'4(S118Y) is used as one of the most optimal 160 substrates (32). Once the substrate is cleaved at the nsp3 and nsp4 (S118Y) junction 161 (E/G) by the active 3CLSP, pET32a-Nsp3 moiety of 18 kDa will be expected. To However, the fluorescence value with nsp4-D185N increased slowly and lightly. In 171 addition, when a small amount of purified proteins were incubated with sufficient 172 fluorogenic peptide substrates in vitro, the fluorescence value with wt nsp4 was 173 significantly higher than that with nsp4-D185N after 10 minute reaction (Fig. 4C ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 85, "end": 87, "text": "45", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 633, "end": 636, "text": "125", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 730, "end": 733, "text": "127", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2517, "text": "148", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2842, "end": 2845, "text": "157", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3003, "end": 3006, "text": "159", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1592, "end": 1602, "text": "Fig. 3A-B)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2036, "text": "Fig. 3C", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2503, "end": 2511, "text": "Fig. 3D)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3587, "end": 3595, "text": "(Fig. 4C", "ref_id": null}], "section": ""}, {"text": "These results suggest that replacing aspartic acid with asparagine at position 185 175 reduces the proteolytic activity of nsp4. impaired its ability to cleave nsp3'4(S118Y) and nsp11'12 ( Fig. 3A-B) . Interestingly, 237 we observed that both of HV nsp4-D185A and VR2332 nsp4-D185A still cleaved 238 some nsp3'4, but not nsp11'12. We speculate that it might be due to the specific 239 structure of this nsp3'4(S118Y) substrate. Although both nsp3'4(S118Y) and nsp11'12 240 are substrates for nsp4, the amino acids in nsp3'4(S118Y) are totally different from 241 nsp11'12. Nsp4-D185A might have some protease activity for nsp3'4 but not for 242 nsp11'12. However, the underlying rationale needs to be investigated in the future. (Fig. 6A ). Analysis showed that there were hydrogen bonds between Asp185 258 and Leucine159 (Leu159) and between Asp185 and Ser160 (Fig. 6B) . However, when 259 Asp185 was replaced by Ala, there were no hydrogen bonds formed between Ala185 260 and Leu159 or Ser160 (Fig. 6C) . Interestingly, when Asp185 was replaced with Asn, 261 similar hydrogen bonds were formed between Asn185 and Leu159 and between 262 Asn185 and Ser160 (Fig. 6D) . Energy analysis showed that nsp4 with Ala185 263 mutation had higher energy value than nsp4 with Asp185 or Asn185 mutation, 264 indicating that both Asp185 and Asn185 can keep nsp4 at a stable condition (data not 265 show). These findings suggest that the hydrogen bonds between these residues might 266 be an important factor in keeping nsp4 structure stable and its proteolytic activity. in PAMs with a much lower titer in vitro (Fig. 5B-C) . This is in consistent with the 280 proteolytic activity study, which shows that the proteolytic activity of nsp4 with 281 Asn185 mutation is decreased (Fig. 4A-C) .

In addition, 185 PRRSV-D185N grew much slower than wt HV, with a titer about 100 times lower 186 than that of wt HV at 48 hpi (Fig. 5C).

The arterivirus nsp4 421 amino acids were from HV (GenBank accession number JX317648.1), JXwn06 422 (GenBank accession number EF641008.1), JXA1 (GenBank accession number 423 EF112445.1), WUH1 (GenBank accession number EU187484.1), VR2332 (GenBank 424 accession number EF536003.1) and EAV (GenBank accession number X53459.3). (C) 425 Nsp4-D185A expression plasmids at different doses (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 \u03bcg) were 426 co-transfected into CRL-2843 cells with pGL3-IFN-\u03b2-Luc and pRL-TK. At 24 h post 427 transfection, cells were treated with or without poly(I:C) (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 8 h and then 428 analyzed for luciferase activities. (D) CRL-2843 cells were transfected with control 429vector, wt nsp4, or nsp4-D185A expression plasmid.
