ELIXIR's 23 nodes have reacted swiftly to support researchers in their combined efforts against the pandemic setting out three joint priorities: 1. Connecting national COVID-19 data platforms to create federated European COVID-19 Data Spaces; 2. Fostering good data management to make COVID-19 data open, FAIR and reusable over the long term; 3. Providing open tools, workflows and computational resources to drive reproducible and collaborative science. ELIXIR's strategy is based on the support given by our national nodes -collectively spanning over 200 institutes -to research projects and on partnering with community initiatives to drive development and adoption of good data practice and community driven standards. ELIXIR Nodes provide support activities locally and internationally, from provisioning compute capabilities to helping collect viral sequence data from hospitals. Some Nodes have prioritised access to their national cloud and compute facilities for all COVID-19 research projects, while others have developed tools to search, access and share all data related to the pandemic in a national healthcare setting.",

Using these established interfaces enables an agile response and by strenghtening connections between national centres the solution does not only address immediate needs but also supports the development of a Below we briefly outline the response-including actions taken by national Nodes-and note that this strategy directly answers to priority action 8 (\"Access to research infrastructures\") and action 9 (\"Research data sharing platform\") in the EU action plan for COVID-19 [10] .

The national infrastructures will in many (most) cases provide storage and data management support for national projects. National infrastructures also provide the bulk of data processing capabilities for the many COVID-19 research projects now underway. ELIXIR Nodes are involved in-and in several cases coordinate-these national genomic and phenotypic data stores. The European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) is a resource for the secure archival and access to all types of potentially identifiable genetic and phenotypic data resulting from biomedical research projects [11] . The EGA is currently transitioning from a centralised model to becoming a federated resource with data deposition and access nodes across Europe. This federated model provides the coordination across Europe to ensure consistent discovery and access to relevant human genetic datasets for research. As much of the COVID-19 host data will come directly from clinical care it will likely be subject to national laws and regulations and therefore, for example, much of the data is unlikely to be consented to leave national jurisdictions. As part of the COVID-19 response ELIXIR will accelerate implementation of the Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (FEGA) to provide the necessary infrastructure and coordination between European national initiatives and ensure rapid sharing of COVID-19 host data in full compliance with national regulations (e.g. GDPR). In addition, the rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic provides a blueprint for European data access in projects such as 1 Million European Genomes [12] .",

We encourage researchers to deposit their data in ELIXIR's Deposition Databases 1 and in particular all raw sequence data should be deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). EMBL-EBI has a dedicated page to assist deposition and sharing of SARS-CoV-2 data into molecular databases. 2 However, not all data can be shared freely and immediately-in addition to preserving trust and respecting the privacy of patients and participants there might also be public health considerations. Here the federated EGA, where ELIXIR nodes are contributing, will be important, enabling data storage compliant with GDPR. In the first weeks of teh European response ELIXIR has further reached out to the data generation underway in the facilities of the ESFRI Research Infrastructures and ensure that data is deposited in existing archives where possible (e.g. EMBL-EBI COVID19 Portal, ENA, IDR, Biostudies etc.) and are made FAIR for the research community at large. Roll-out open source tools, workflows and computational resources to support reusable and reproducible computational analysis of COVID-19 data Galaxy (covid19.galaxyproject.org) is emerging as a key system for connecting national facilities and rapidly deploying open reproducible workflows in the COVID-19 response. In addition, a rapidly increasing number of national facilities are providing cloud compute capacity that underpin the community use of Galaxy. For instance by providing interfaces into open-access workflow and analysis environments (e.g. usegalaxy.eu) and fast-track a minimal viable product for the WorkflowHub.eu, to provide a registry to collect COVID-19 related workflows to ensure that researchers can collaborate, publish and reuse developed workflows and pipelines.",

For example, the virtual COVID-19-BH-20 BioHackathon pulled together bioinformaticians globally to create a cohesive effort and work on tooling for COVID-19 analysis. Many ELIXIR Nodes are supporting this BioHackathon with e.g. cloud compute and storage resources and ELIXIR Fig. 1 ELIXIR' s drive open and rapid access to data, tools and workflows for the European COVID-19 response. We will achieve this by developing COVID-19 actions across our member states and support the linking of these into Interconnected European Data Spaces for COVID-19. By rooting our response in existing national and European infrastructures the strategy contributes to the development of a European data platform for health-related information exchange. The European landscape is rapidly developing and an up-to-date version of the map is provided online: https://elixir-europe.org/services/covid-19resources.",

Healthcare is a national-or often regional-competence and a coordinated federated environment for secure data archival, access, and analysis is essential for European collaborations. By rooting our response in existing national and European infrastructures the strategy contributes to the development of a European data platform for health-related information exchange. Via national infrastructures ELIXIR will also drive development and publication of open reproducible tools and workflows for COVID research. The sustainability of the solutions is key-whilst scientific efforts are quickly refocused to support the developing pandemic Europe also needs to think about the longer term. Resources are finite and so investments need to be focused on solutions that can be redeployed towards future challenges and ensure a long-term preparedness.",
