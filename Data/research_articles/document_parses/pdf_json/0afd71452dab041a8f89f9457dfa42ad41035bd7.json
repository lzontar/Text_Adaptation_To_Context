The study was performed on 388 patients. It was found that thromboembolic events occurred in 28 patients (21%), half of whom were diagnosed in the first 24 h of hospitalization. 44 patients underwent VTE imaging, which was confirmed in 16 patients (36%). Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed in 30 subjects (7.7% of total cases), in which pulmonary embolism was confirmed in 10 subjects (33% of CTPA subjects). Both Ischemic Stroke and ACS/MI were observed in 2.5% and 1.1% of patients, respectively. Overt Diffuse Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) was observed in 8 patients (2.2%). It was concluded that due to the high number of arterial and especially venous thromboembolic events in hospitalized patients, especially in the first 24 h of admission, as well as the high number of positive VTE cases in imaging, They urgently stated the needs to improve VTE diagnostic strategies and thromboembolic events and also consider thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19. And discuss the in patients with COVID-19.",

The use of prophylaxis with Enoxaparin or Heparin in severe cases of COVID-19 or in patients with D-dimer level more than six times of normal levels has been reported to reduce mortality. So, in Iran, according to the recent version of guidelines published by the Iran's Ministry of Health, prescription of anticoagulants in patients with COVID-19 is considered as follows: 1. in all patients admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19, prophylaxis with Enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg daily subcutaneously or heparin at a dose of 5000 units subcutaneous twice daily or three times daily is recommended. 2. In patients who are prohibited from taking anticoagulants, the use of mechanical prophylactic methods such as compressive stocking is recommended.",
