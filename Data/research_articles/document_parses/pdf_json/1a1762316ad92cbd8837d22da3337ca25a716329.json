Air pollution is a causative factor for both various symptoms such as bronchospasm, rhinorrhea, eye redness, and irritation, as well as various allergic diseases such as asthma, chronic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, atopic dermatitis, seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis, and vernal or atopic keratoconjunctivitis. 4 increasing asthma exacerbations and the global mortality. 6 Putative etiologic relation between atmospheric changes and allergic diseases is mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress in tissues exposed enhancing immunologic responses to allergens, carrying aeroallergens into the airways, and inducing epithelial permeability. 6 Interestingly, NASA's Aura satellite described a NO 2 decrease by 25% across China from January 1-20, 2020 (before the quarantine) to February 10-25 (during the quarantine). 7 Similar decrease was measured in most megalopolis of developing countries around the world where containment was set for limiting the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1 ). 8 following containment for limiting the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (satellite images from European Spatial Agency (ESA)). 8 ",

Initially described in Wuhan, Hubei, China, the increase of worldwide tourism and commercial airline flights upgraded the numbers of countries infected, causing hundred-thousand cases and several thousands of deaths. The worldwide authorities responded by promulgating global quarantine in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO). Consequently, human activities have been drastically decreased with massive reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Since one century, the worldwide emission of greenhouse gas, i.e. NO 2 and CO 2 , involved a global warming up to 1\u00b0C compared to the preindustrial era, increasing air humidity and mould exposure, and modifying pollen patterns. 5 Concordantly with the climatic changes, sensitisation rates and allergic diseases increased with the level of allergenicity of several species of plants as ragweed, birch or plan tree. The heat stress and the air pollution peaks promote mucosal and systemic inflammation decreasing the airway hyperreactivity threshold,",

Initially spreading around Asia, the epicenter of epidemic moved to Europe and, tomorrow, probably in American and African continent. Even if this global containment lasts one or two months, the impact on the air quality should be significant on the allergic diseases exposome during forthcoming months. We have seen smaller examples in which regional decrease in use to fossil fuels is related to decreased exacerbation of allergic disease. However, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in global decrease in the use of fossil fuels. This may offer an unintended insight on a global scale of the impact of decreased fossil fuel use impacts allergic and respiratory disease.",
