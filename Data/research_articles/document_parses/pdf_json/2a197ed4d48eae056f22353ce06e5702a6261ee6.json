In this review article, we examine the new picture of the evolution of RNA viruses, the dominant component of the eukaryotic virome, that is emerging from metagenomic data analysis. The major expansion of many groups of RNA viruses through metagenomics allowed the construction of substantially improved phylogenetic trees for the conserved virus genes, primarily, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). In particular, a new superfamily of widespread, small positive-strand RNA viruses was delineated that unites tombus-like and noda-like viruses. Comparison of the genome architectures of RNA viruses discovered by metagenomics and by traditional methods reveals an extent of gene module shuffling among diverse virus genomes that far exceeds the previous appreciation of this evolutionary phenomenon. Most dramatically, inclusion of the metagenomic data in phylogenetic analyses of the RdRp resulted in the identification of numerous, strongly supported groups that encompass RNA viruses from diverse hosts including different groups of protists, animals and plants. Notwithstanding potential caveats, in particular, incomplete and uneven sampling of eukaryotic taxa, these highly unexpected findings reveal horizontal virus transfer (HVT) between diverse hosts as the central aspect of RNA virus evolution. The vast and diverse virome of invertebrates, particularly nematodes and arthropods, appears to be the reservoir, from which the viromes of plants and vertebrates evolved via multiple HVT events.",

Ideally, it would be enormously useful to know the exact host organism(s) for each virus found in both environmental and holobiont metagenomes. Such knowledge would contribute to tracing evolution of the virus host ranges and empower development of evidence-based scenarios for the origins and evolution of each virus class. In the real world, we are limited to educated guesses on the likely hosts of 'metagenomic viruses' based on the known host ranges of their closest relatives. In some instances, such inferences come with high confidence: e.g., when a typical bacteriophage is found upon sequencing a spider, chances are that this bacteriophage infects spider-associated bacteria. Furthermore, for some viruses, metagenomics could provide ways for definitive assignment of the host(s), such as identification of multiple CRISPR spacers for a bacterial or archaeal virus genome (Edwards et al., 2016; Willner and Hugenholtz, 2013) .",

For instance, aquatic samples are typically run through filters that could enrich either for viruses or for bacteria and pico-eukaryotes, while leaving multicellular eukaryotes and large protists behind (Brum and Sullivan, 2015; Chow and Suttle, 2015; Hayes et al., 2017) . Another layer of selectivity is provided by the abundance bias. For aquatic environments, it could be expected that most of the isolated viruses would come from the most abundant organisms, such as prokaryotes and eukaryotic plankton, rather than from large animals, such as sharks, walruses or whales, the global abundance of which in the oceans is low (even taking into account that larger hosts could yield more viruses than small ones).",

            "text": "Due to the limited known diversity of prokaryotic RNA viruses that include a single family each of bacterial (+)RNA and dsRNA viruses, and only one putative (+)RNA virus of archaea , most of this review deals with the RNA viruses of eukaryotes that represent the majority of the eukaryotic virome. By any measure, the emergence of eukaryotes (eukaryogenesis) was one of the principal evolutionary transitions in the history of life (Booth and Doolittle, 2015; Koonin, 2015; Martijn and Ettema, 2013) . Cohabitation of two types of cells, the archaeal host and the bacterial \"guest\" that became an endosymbiont and eventually evolved into the mitochondrion, as well as the emergence of the endomembrane system and the nucleus, dramatically changed cell biology and resulted in a tectonic shift in host-parasite interactions. This shift presented enormous challenges and opportunities for then extant viruses and other selfish genetic elements. One major outcome of this process was the massive proliferation of Group II introns, bacterial retroelements that are thought to have reshaped eukaryotic genome by spawning spliceosomal introns and numerous types of retrotransposons (Irimia and Roy, 2014; Rogozin et al., 2012) . Another striking outcome was a cardinal change in the virome composition: whereas the viromes of archaea and bacteria are heavily dominated by DNA viruses, the eukaryotic virome exhibits a substantial excess of RNA viruses, albeit with a healthy proportion of DNA ones .",

This turbulent process was followed by rapid diversification of the newborn ancestors of the major virus lineages along with the radiation of the supergroups of eukaryotes. It has been further proposed that the representation of DNA viruses in the eukaryotic virome was limited due to the separation of the nucleus, the 'DNA-RNA compartment', from the cytosol, the endomembrane-rich 'RNA compartment'. Due to this compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells, DNA viruses that evolved to utilize at least some elements of DNA replication and transcription machineries of the prokaryotic cell were challenged with finding ways to enter the nucleus through the membrane barrier or else evolving autonomous replication and transcription systems, which hampered their spread in eukaryotes. Concurrently, eukaryotes evolved antiviral innate immunity mechanisms that identify and inactivate 'illegitimate' cytosolic viral DNA, further compromising reproduction of DNA viruses (Goubau et al., 2013; Mansur et al., 2014; Paludan and Bowie, 2013; Sparrer and Gack, 2015) .",

Unlike the short-lived, co-transcriptionally translated mRNAs of prokaryotes, mature mRNAs of eukaryotes, typically show much lower turnover rates (Chen and Shyu, 2017; Mohanty and Kushner, 2016) . Perhaps even more importantly, the cytosol is highly compartmentalized by the endomembrane system that consists of the expansive endoplasmic reticulum network, various vesicles and larger organelles, such as Golgi stacks, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Therefore, the cytosol provides a hospitable habitat for RNA viruses, most of which recruit various endomembranes, especially, the ER, to form 'viral factories', distinct membranous formations within the cytosol in which viral genomes are replicated and expressed, and virions are formed (Ahlquist, 2006; Diaz and Ahlquist, 2012) . These factories also provide a level of protection against antiviral responses that target 'alien' RNAs.",

This modality of virus evolution was generally supported by in-depth studies of several virus lineages including the vast picornavirus-like superfamily of small (+)RNA viruses although vertical evolution clearly was confounded by numerous exchanges of gene modules among viruses (Koonin et al., 2008) . In addition, we have considered another route of evolution, namely, horizontal virus transfer (HVT) between diverse hosts. The HVT scenario has found support in phylogenomic analyses of plant viruses with (\u2212)RNA genomes which appear to be a derived subset of related animal viruses, a likely result of HVT facilitated by herbivorous arthropods (Dolja and Koonin, 2011) .

We further compare the RNA viromes of different types of organisms and present evidence that distinct RNA virus lineages originated from prokaryotic RNA viruses, prokaryotic reverse-transcribing elements, or from pre-existing groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses. The resulting new evolutionary scenario for RNA viruses signifies a major shift in our understanding of virus evolution and implies that the extant (+)RNA virome of eukaryotes was shaped through a complex process whereby evolutionary continuity of major viral lineages was complemented by rampant HVT.",

Given that bacteria are far more ancient, ancestral organisms relative to eukaryotes, the most parsimonious, intuitive scenario for the origin of eukaryotic (+)RNA viruses would involve direct descent from Leviviridae-like ancestors. The problem with this scenario is that, although not outright false, it seems to be substantially incomplete because there is no clear indication of a direct evolutionary relationship between leviviruses and the bulk of eukaryotic RNA viruses. Actually, the RdRps of the eukaryotic viruses appear to be more closely related to reverse transcriptases (RT) of prokaryotic mobile elements, namely Group II self-splicing introns, than to the levivirus RdRps (Koonin et al., 2008) . Phylogenetic trees combining the RdRps of eukaryotic and prokaryotic (+)RNA viruses with RTs are inherently unreliable due to the large evolutionary distances. Nevertheless, the higher sequence similarity between eukaryotic viral RdRp and RTs of group II introns along with the wide spread of these retroelements in bacteria, which contrasts the relatively narrow host range of leviviruses, seems to make the RT origin plausible for the RdRps of the eukaryotic (+)RNA viruses. It is unclear whether the RdRp of leviviruses (Kidmose et al., 2010) itself also originates from a bacterial RT or from a primordial RdRp that is generally thought to have been one of the central players in the transition from an ancient RNA world to the RNA-protein world. The coat protein that forms the icosahedral levivirus capsids has a unique structural fold (Golmohammadi et al., 1993) , and its origin remains obscure .",

Given the bacterial origin of mitochondria, it can be assumed that a levivirus-like virus of the \u03b1-proteobacterial ancestor of the mitochondrion was brought along during eukaryogenesis, and subsequently, upon the transition of the endosymbiont to the organelle life style, lost its coat and other non-replicational genes, becoming a selfish RNA element of the genus Mitovirus (Koonin and Dolja, 2014) . The Narnavirus elements could originate from either a Mitovirus that escaped to the cytosol or (less parsimoniously) from another levilike virus that adopted to reproduction in the cytosol. This scenario implies that the mitoviruses are ancestral in eukaryotes even though these viruses so far have not been discovered in any hosts other than the unikont and archaeplastida supergroups (Fig. 1B) . Although the descendants of (+)RNA bacteriophages might have been lost in the rest of the eukaryotic lineages, we suspect that the major reason for their apparently narrow spread is the limited scope of protist metagenomics. Once such studies advance, mito-like viruses can be expected to be identified in diverse protists. Indeed, narna-like viruses have been recently detected in parasitic trypanosomatid protists (Akopyants et al., 2016a; Lye et al., 2016) , as well as in Baltic sea meta-transcriptomes, although the hosts of these marine viruses remain known (Zeigler Allen et al., 2017) .",

The three-partite cystovirus genomes encode 14 proteins, which form a complex capsid that consists of two icosahedral shells. An internal shell has a T = 1 symmetry (often referred to as T = 2, because unlike true T = 1 capsids, a capsomer is a CP dimer), whereas an external T = 13 shell is formed from a different capsid protein (Makeyev and Grimes, 2004) . The outer-most virion layer is formed by a lipoprotein envelope containing receptor-binding spikes. The crystal structure of the cystovirus RdRp exhibits a 'palm-and-fingers' fold typical of the viral RdRps and RTs, which supports a common origin for all of these polymerases. Structural comparisons have shown significant similarity between the cystovirus RdRp and that of the Hepatitis C flavivirus (Butcher et al., 2001) . More recent comparisons, however, indicate a closer structural similarity between the RdRps of cystoviruses and picobirnaviruses, one of the eukaryotic dsRNA virus families (Krupovic, personal communication). The picobirnaviruses also share a T = 2 capsid symmetry with that of the internal shell of cystoviruses. Thus, the possibility seems to exist that picobirnaviruses are direct descendants of cystoviruses in eukaryotes, in parallel to the origin of nano-, mito-and ourmiaviruses from leviviruses (see the preceding section). Interestingly, the dsRNA reoviruses of diverse eukaryotes possess a T = 2 and T = 13 double-shelled capsid (Poranen and Bamford, 2012; Trask et al., 2012) similar to that of cystoviruses but not seen in any other viruses, suggesting an evolutionary connection between these virus families. Thus, the dsRNA bacteriophages and their apparent eukaryotic descendants exhibit complex evolutionary relationships that appear to involve both the replicational and the structural gene modules. Clarifying these relationships is in important problem on the way to a general concept of RNA virus evolution.",

            "text": "Unicellular eukaryotes (aka protists) is an umbrella name that covers extremely diverse organisms from all major eukaryotic lineages (Katz, 2012; Parfrey et al., 2006) . Many protists are free-living organisms, both heterotrophs like amoebae and autotrophs like many photosynthesizing classes of phytoplankton. Other diverse protists, such as Leishmania or Plasmodium, are parasites. Although the extant protists are no less evolved than more complex, multicellular eukaryotes, they play a special role in discerning the origins of present-day viruses. One reason for this is that protists represent all major eukaryotic lineages (supergroups) that apparently radiated from the Last Common Eukaryotic Ancestor (LECA) over a relatively short time interval following the initial events of eukaryogenesis (Katz and Grant, 2015; Keeling et al., 2005; Koonin, 2010; Yoon et al., 2008) . Therefore, direct ancestors of modern protists presumably were already around at the time when the ancestors of eukaryotic viruses have emerged. In contrast, the multicellular eukaryotes, such as some brown and green algae, oomycetes and fungi, as well as the more complex animals and vascular plants, form relatively small twigs in the phylogenic tree of eukaryotes that have emerged much later than protists (Berbee et al., 2017; Hinchliff et al., 2015; Katz and Grant, 2015) . Furthermore, most protists are aquatic organisms that have never left the environment in which both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic life forms have evolved accompanied by their respective viromes. This primeval environment also provided a medium conducive to virus dispersal through diffusion, as well as to virus survival thanks to the protection from UV irradiation Schematic dendrogram based on the phylogenetic tree for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of Narna-Levi clade from Shi et al.

Strikingly, the very first investigation of marine eukaryotic (+)RNA viruses revealed a community that appeared to be dominated by picorna-like viruses most similar to previously described viruses of eukaryotic plankton (Culley et al., 2006) implying that these viruses infect marine protists. A few tombus-like viruses also have been identified; although these viruses encoded RdRps related to those of plant tombusviruses, they lacked movement proteins typical of plant viruses indicating distinct, most likely protist hosts (Culley et al., 2006 (Culley et al., , 2007 . Two other tombus-like viruses have been identified in holobionts of freshwater shrimp; because these viruses use ciliate genetic code, they likely infect these alveolate protists associated with shrimp (Shi et al., 2016a) . Several subsequent studies on marine and freshwater RNA viromes have greatly expanded the geographic coverage from tropical to Antarctic seas to Antarctic inland lakes (Culley et al., 2014; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2015; Miranda et al., 2016; Moniruzzaman et al., 2017) . However, the general trend in the RNA virome structure remained the same: the majority of new viruses were picorna-like, with a handful of tombus-like viruses. Likewise, a large variety of picorna-like viruses most similar to those found in marine metagenomes and various unicellular alveolates and stramenopiles have been identified in reclaimed water (Rosario et al., 2009) .",

Because the lion share of RNA viruses discovered in a variety of diverse protists are (+)RNA viruses from the picorna-like lineage, this group most likely emerged and diversified very early in the evolution of eukaryotes (Koonin et al., 2008) . Other lineages of potential ancient origin include (+)RNA tombus-like viruses and dsRNA totiviruses. The apparent absence of (\u2212)RNA viruses in prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes implies their more recent origin, presumably associated with the emergence of multicellularity. Clearly, this evolutionary scenario would be falsified if (\u2212)RNA viruses were discovered in unicellular eukaryotes. This latter possibility was emphasized by the detection of Mononegavirales-like viruses in the Baltic sea RNA virome although it is not clear if the hosts of these viruses are protists because some fish and mammalian viruses were also present in the samples (Zeigler Allen et al., 2017). Furthermore, a Bunya-like virus has been identified in a trypanosomatid protist parasite of insects (Akopyants et al., 2016b) ; in this case, an HVT from the host to the parasite is a suspect.",

            "text": "However, not all (+)RNA viruses of fungi are capsid-less. The fungal members of the family Alphaflexiviridae (genera Botrexvirus and Sclerodarnavirus) possess RNA replication modules and filamentous capsids typical of plant viruses of the same family, but lack homologs of plant virus movement proteins (Ghabrial et al., 2015) . A recent metatranscriptome analyses recovered several fungal (+)RNA virus genomes related to Benyviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Virgaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Tymoviridae, large families of plant viruses for which no fungal members have been identified previously (Deakin et al., 2017; Marzano et al., 2016) . Given the tight association between plants and plantparasitic-and symbiotic fungi, an evolutionary scenario in which the fungal (+)RNA viruses have originated via HVT from plants appears to be plausible. An additional argument in support of this scenario is that plants host a greater diversity of viruses from each of the families mentioned above, implying a longer co-evolution of these virus families with plants than with the fungi. The inter-kingdom HVT to fungi might not be limited to plants: a capsid-less Sclerotinia sclerotiorum virus L exhibits the closest evolutionary affinity to animal viruses of the alphalike superfamily (Liu et al., 2009) . In contrast to the fungal (+)RNA viruses discussed above, Mushroom bacilliform virus and other recently discovered members of the family Barnaviridae (Marzano et al., 2016; Revill et al., 1994) , possess distinct bacilliform capsids and appear to be V.V. Dolja, E.V. Koonin Virus Research 244 (2018) 36-52 the 'original' mycoviruses, with only very remote relatives within the picornavirus-like superfamily (Koonin et al., 2008) . As mentioned above, the fungal virome is enriched in dsRNA viruses, some families of which are thought to be unique to fungi (Ghabrial et al., 2015) . These families include Chrysoviridae with fourcomponent genomes and 'true' T = 1 icosahedral capsids built of a single capsid protein, Quadriviridae, whose four genome segments are encapsidated into isometric virions built of two capsid proteins, and Megabirnaviridae with icosahedral capsids and two genome segments.",

Two of the partitivirus genera, Alphaparititivirus and Betapartitivirus, harbor closely related viruses that infect either fungi or plants, again suggestive of extensive HVT between plantparasitic fungi and their hosts. A less expansive dsRNA virus family isolated from both fungi and plants is Amalgaviridae, with monopartite genomes (Depierreux et al., 2016) . Virions of amalgaviruses remain to be identified but protein sequence analysis has unexpectedly shown that these viruses encode a homolog of the nucleocapsid proteins of (\u2212) RNA viruses of the genera Phlebovirus and Tenuivirus, suggesting evolution via unprecedented recombination between a dsRNA virus and a (\u2212)RNA virus (Krupovic et al., 2015a) .

Such HVT is likely facilitated by the tight fungus-plant association that involves penetration of fungal appressoria through the plant cell walls (Ryder and Talbot, 2015) , as well as by recruitment of fungal zoospores as transmission vectors by some plant viruses (Rochon et al., 2004) . As discussed below, this form of HVT likely operates also between fungi and arthropods.",

More recent metagenomics studies, also called 'ecological genomics', because viruses have been identified in individual plants collected from particular environments, such as prairie or tropical forest, have revealed prevalence of persistent viruses that cause no obvious disease in their wild plant hosts (Roossinck et al., 2015) . These studies have also identified many new viruses that belonged to already known plant virus families. Although the obtained data sets have been claimed to include additional sequences of highly divergent, novel viruses, to our knowledge, none of these have been released so far. Likewise, metagenomics approaches to virus identification in crop plants, e.g., grapevine, yielded mostly RNA viruses of known families (Coetzee et al., 2010) .",

The presence of this conserved module in both vertebrate and plant viruses clearly indicates monophyly of the alpha-like superfamily. Given the extreme evolutionary divergence and relatively recent origins of these 'crown groups' of multicellular, most complex eukaryotes, it could be proposed that the ancestral alpha-like virus emerged in a unicellular eukaryote prior to the divergence of the plant and vertebrate lineages.

Following the original HVT event, presumably, from the proto-mitochondrion to the proto-eukaryote, the Levi-Narna clade was firmly established in fungi, being represented by the Mitovirus and Narnavirus genera. Intriguingly, a handful of crustacean viruses are lodged within the mitovirus cluster in the phylogenetic tree of the RdRp. Moreover, the yeast and other fungal viruses of the narnavirus cluster are sandwiched between branches filled with viruses of crustaceans and other invertebrates (Shi et al., 2016a) . Assuming that fungi, which are omnipresent in aquatic environments, are older than invertebrates (Berbee et al., 2017) , it appears likely that the latter acquired their narna-like viruses from the former via HVT. The opposite HVT direction is also possible, e.g., via fungi that are invertebrate parasites. As to plant Ourmiavirus, which clusters with the invertebrate narna-like viruses, there is little doubt about their origin through HVT from invertebrates (Fig. 1) .",

This hypothesis has found substantial support in the case of the picorna-like superfamily, where the conserved signature gene array appears to have been drawn from bacteriophages, bacterial selfish elements and the mitochondrial endosymbiont (Koonin et al., 2008) . The global ecology of picorna-like viruses that includes diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes is also in agreement with the early origin of these viruses followed by rapid diversification and continuous evolution along the emerging branches of eukaryotes.

Among the staggering variety of picorna-like viruses, a vast 'Aquatic picorna-like cluster' has been identified as a monophyletic group (Shi et al., 2016a) . This lineage combines viruses of diverse aquatic invertebrates including crustaceans, chelicerates and lophotrochozoans. Remarkably, different branches of the aquatic lineage also include viruses of diverse marine unicellular hosts such as diatoms, raphidophytes and thraustrochytrids, organisms that are phylogenetically far removed from invertebrates, but share the marine environment with many of them. Such tight evolutionary affinity between viruses infecting unrelated hosts but sharing the same habitat seems best compatible with extensive HVT. Should this be the case, it can be further hypothesized that the contiguous lineage of the ancient picornavirus-like viruses present in marine plankton seeded the emerging invertebrate virome early in the evolution of invertebrates (Fig. 2B) . It stands to reason that this insemination occurred in the shared marine environment, during the Cambrian explosion, the rapid animal diversification that spawned most of the extant invertebrate lineages (Janvier, 2015; Knoll and Nowak, 2017) .",

The position of this branch leaves little doubt of its later emergence compared with the clusters containing viruses of unicellular eukaryotes and invertebrates ( Fig. 2A ) (Shi et al., 2016a) . However, the exact ancestry of picornaviruses remains somewhat enigmatic because there is no compact sister group closely related to this family of vertebrate viruses. Such a sister group might be still lurking undetected in some unexpected habitat and would come up in subsequent metagenomics studies. Alternatively, it could be the case that, when the ancestor of Picornaviridae, most likely, an invertebrate virus, was transferred to a primitive chordate, rapid evolution required to adapt to a new type of host all but obliterated the ancestral evolutionary signal. Similar reasoning could apply to the 'Caliciviridae' branch that consists of a family of vertebrate viruses at the root of the expansive 'Picorna-Calici clade' (Fig. 2) . In this case, however, a lone virus closely related to the caliciviruses has been identified in a freshwater mollusk. Ditto the 'Astro' clade, a lineage remotely related to other picorna-like viruses. This clade includes a family of vertebrate viruses Astroviridae and so far, only four viruses of diverse invertebrates (Shi et al., 2016a) .",

            "text": "The evolutionary patterns among the picorna-like viruses of plants and vertebrates are notably contrasting. The families of picorna-like viruses of angiosperms are positioned within clusters of invertebrate viruses, apparently, indicative of relatively recent origins of the former from contiguous lineages of the latter via HVT (Fig. 2) . In contrast, vertebrate picornaviruses, caliciviruses and astroviruses appear far diverged from their presumable invertebrate ancestors, implying longer and/or faster host-dependent evolution of the vertebrate viruses compared to that of their plant counterparts. This implication is compatible with the currently accepted timeline of evolution, according to which Chordates emerged in the marine environments, perhaps, as early as early Cambrian, \u223c540 Mya (Janvier, 2015; Knoll and Nowak, 2017) . The flowering plants' line of decent comes from Zygnematophycea, filamentous or single-celled, freshwater algae of the Characean lineage (Umen, 2014) . Upon terrestrialization \u223c400 Mya, evolution of land plants included emergence of liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, horsetails and gymnosperms. A recent transcriptome analysis of the pre-flowering plant lineages has revealed only a marginal presence of (+)RNA viruses (Mushegian et al., 2016) implying that the enormous extant RNA virome of flowering plants emerged later, i.e. at the time when these plants conquered the land as late as early to mid-Cretaceous, \u223c100 Mya (Bowman et al., 2007; Kenrick and Crane, 1997) . Thus, the chordates would enjoy extra \u223c400 M years for evolving their viromes after the presumed HVT from ancient marine invertebrates, which explains why these viromes appear farther diverged from invertebrate ones than those of plants (Fig. 2B) . All the indications of HVT notwithstanding, the possibility remains that the early chordates received their pro-virome via vertical inheritance from their ancestors. Investigation of the extant viromes of basal branches of metazoa, such as sponges and Cnidaria, will help to choose between these possibilities.",

Previous attempts at discerning the evolutionary relationships between (+)RNA viruses have suggested affinity between plant Tombusviridae and animal Flaviviridae that, however, relied solely on clustering of these two groups in the phylogenetic trees of the RdRp (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) . The drastic increase in the number and diversity of the available virus genomes resulted in an apparent flavi-tombus breakup. An even more feeble relationship between nodaviruses and picorna-like viruses has also ended in separation that was buttressed by the identification of a putative capping enzyme encoded by nodaviruses, but never found in picorna-like viruses (Ahola and Karlin, 2015) . Furthermore, when the enormous ecological and evolutionary diversity of both tombus-like viruses and noda-like viruses has been revealed, these two major lineages showed mutual attraction in the amended phylogenetic trees of the RdRps, resulting in the 'Tombus-noda clade' of small icosahedral (+)RNA viruses (Shi et al., 2016a) .",

This clean split started to deteriorate upon identification of Yokoi et al., 2003) and nematodes (Felix et al., 2011; Franz et al., 2012) . The massive transcriptome analysis of various invertebrates further bloated this virus lineage with new viruses that possessed either alphanodavirus-like or tombusvirus-like capsid protein (also present in betanodaviruses), as well as with some viruses with a capsid protein that appeared related to those of marine picorna-like viruses (Shi et al., 2016a) . These new findings have blurred the boundaries between the two nodavirus genera while closing the gulf in the host range of the Nodaviridae by expanding it across a wide range of animals. Furthermore, the large group of viruses closely related to fish Betanodavirus turned to be viruses of crustaceans, an older animal group than fish, but sharing the same environment. Thus, the same, now familiar evolutionary scenario would involve diversification of the noda-like lineage in invertebrates followed by HVT from crustaceans to fish. Recently, the Tombus-noda clade has received another reinforcement in Statoviruses, a novel group of viruses found in mammalian stool samples (Janowski et al., 2017) . It remains to be established if statoviruses reproduce in mammalian hosts or in organisms present in their alimentary tracts. The extremely broad host range of the Tombus-noda group that includes diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, together with the existence of all possible combinations of the noda-like and tombus-like RdRps with noda-like and tombus-like capsid proteins, imply an ancient origin, co-habitation and notable host promiscuity of these small viruses.",

These flaviviruses have relatively uniform, monopartite, 10-12 kb genomes with a conserved gene module that encodes protease, superfamily 2 helicase, capping enzyme and RdRp . Metagenomic analysis resulted in the discovery of flavi-like viruses that are specific to arthropods (rather than shuttling between mammals and arthropods as the classical flaviviruses do), nematodes and plants, with monopartite genomes up to 26 kb in length, twice the size limit of the 'orthodox' Flaviviridae. In addition, several novel branches of flavi-like viruses, such as arthropod Jingmenvirus were discovered (Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016b) ; in contrast to other viruses of this clade, the genomes of jingmenviruses are tetrapartite.",

These findings imply that vertebrates have acquired flavi-like viruses via HVT that was probably facilitated by tight associations of blood-sucking arthropods with their vertebrate prey. Given the existence of closely related viruses of plant-parasitic nematodes (Bekal et al., 2014) and aphids (Teixeira et al., 2016) , the origin of the plant-infecting flavi-like viruses so far discovered (Kobayashi et al., 2013) similarly could be explained by HVT from invertebrates feeding on plant roots or leaves. So far, no flavilike viruses have been found in unicellular eukaryotes, implying a later origin of this group, perhaps in ancestral metazoa, although discovery of related viruses infecting protists could refute this hypothesis.",

Previously, the TMV-like CPs have been thought to be specific to an array of plant viruses with rigid, rod-shaped capsids (Dolja et al., 1991) . The discovery of TMV-like capsids in invertebrate viruses, although not revealing the ultimate ancestry of their unique \u03b1-helical fold, implies an origin outside the plant virome. It should be emphasized, however, that the diverse proteins that drive cell-to-cell movement of plant viruses, as well as those that suppress plant RNAi defense, remain unique to the plant RNA virome (Csorba et al., 2015; Heinlein, 2015) . Notably, one of the insect viruses that encodes a TMV-like capsid protein also encompasses an unusual, large RNA replication module similar in size to those of Closteroviridae, suggesting that this family of the largest plant viruses with \u223c15-20 kb genomes also emerged from a particular lineage of invertebrate viruses.",

These viruses, similarly to many vertebrate and invertebrate viruses of the alpha-like virus superfamily, possess enveloped particles, a feature that is so far unique among plant alpha-like viruses, which typically form simple proteinaceous capsids. Given the position of the cilevirus RdRps in the phylogenetic tree and their transmission by arthropod vectors, it seems most likely that cileviruses are a result of a relatively recent HVT from an arthropod to a plant.

It is not yet certain whether the alpha-like replication module emerged early in unicellular eukaryotes, or later in metazoa. Obviously, however, the phylogenomic diversity of invertebrate alpha-like viruses encompasses prototypes of the structural modules found in both vertebrate and plant viruses.

It cannot be readily placed into the currently recognized superfamilies of the (+)RNA viruses although affinity with picorna-like viruses has been proposed based on the RdRp comparison and the presence of a 3C-like protease typical of picorna-like viruses in the Coronaviridae family of Nidovirales . So far, no nidolike viruses have been found in unicellular eukaryotes or any branches of the eukaryotic tree other than animals. The phylogenetic tree of the 'Nido clade' is currently split into four major lineages: i) the deepestrooted branch with two insect and one spider virus; ii) vertebrate Coronaviridae (Corovavirinae); iii) insect Mesoniviridae and crustacean Roniviridae intermixed with divergent crustacean and mollusk viruses; iv) vertebrate Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae (Torovirinae) (Shi et al., 2016a) . Surprisingly, the latter subfamily also contains two viruses associated with the snake nematodes, both closely related to a Ball python nidovirus, which causes a severe respiratory disease in this snake (Stenglein et al., 2014) . This could be a case of a recent HVT although a nematode contamination with virus-containing snake material cannot be ruled out. The overall topology of the RdRp tree suggests that the nido-like clade of animal viruses emerged in early invertebrates and then invaded the vertebrate virome via HVT. The relatively small genome size of the deep-rooted arthropod viruses (roughly half of that of vertebrate coronaviruses) agrees with this interpretation, further suggesting that the largest known RNA genomes of Coronaviridae (\u223c30 kb) have evolved via accretion of genes during coevolution with the vertebrate hosts.",

The flavilike superfamily, with its dubious unification of flaviviruses and tombusviruses, is gone but the departure of the tombus-like viruses is compensated by the dramatic expansion in the diversity and host range of new flavi-like viruses. In parallel, the vast picorna-like superfamily has lost its purported peripheral members, the noda-like viruses, and yet, became even vaster by absorbing new large clusters of undeniable picorna-like viruses, such as the 'aquatic cluster'. The third of the previously established (+)RNA virus superfamilies, the alpha-like one, while absorbing numerous invertebrate viruses, retained all the previously included families of the plant and vertebrate viruses. A major new addition to the evolutionary layout of the (+)RNA virome is the expansive, widespread tombus-noda supergroup that includes the smallest and simplest among the known RNA viruses of eukaryotes. This simplicity of genome architecture, along with the broad host range, suggests that tombus-noda viruses, together with the picornalike viruses, are the most ancient (+)RNA viruses of eukaryotes. However, caution is still due, given that the positive evidence in support of the tombusvirus-nodavirus affinity stems solely from the topology of the RdRp tree. Although the current genome collection vastly exceeds that of two decades ago, lending extra credence to the phylogeny, it is difficult to rule out that, with further accumulation of diverse genomes, this supergroup goes the way of the flavi-tombus assemblage.",

The 'Toti-Chryso clade' of viral RdRps combines the families Totiviridae, Chrysoviridae and Quadriviridae with a panoply of newly discovered viruses of invertebrates, fungi, plants, vertebrates and likely diatoms, and splits into two major clusters (Shi et al., 2016a) . In one cluster, there is a well-supported branch that encompasses Victorivirus, Leishmaniavirus and Trichomonasavirus genera of Totiviridae. A notable feature of this branch is that the former genus includes fungal viruses, whereas the other two consist of viruses of parasitic excavate protists. The enormous evolutionary distance that separates the two host taxa implies that the close phylogenetic relationship between viruses infecting parasites of vertebrates (Leishmania and Trichomonas) and of plants (many of the fungi hosting victoriviruses are plant-parasitic) is due to HVT. It is difficult to imagine an ecological niche where such HVT could have occurred but missing links are likely to exist. Notably, this branch of the Toti-Chryso clade also includes a Diatom colony-associated virus (Urayama et al., 2016) . The diatoms belong to stramenopiles, a eukaryotic lineage that is equally distant from fungi and excavates. This diatom virus is most closely related to a virus identified in a razor clam holobiont; this relationship could be due either to HVT from a diatom to a mollusk that feeds by filtrating water often containing diatoms, or to contamination of the mollusk holobiont with totivirus-infected diatoms.",

Phylogenomic comparisons of the viruses infecting vertebrates and plants, two distant lineages of the multicellular eukaryotes, indicated that the plant (\u2212) RNA virome is a subset of that of the vertebrates (Kormelink et al., 2011) . For instance, the family Tospoviridae of plant (\u2212)RNA viruses placed within the much larger order of the primarily vertebrate viruses, Bunyavirales. Moreover, comparison of genome architectures shows that the genomes of plant (\u2212)RNA viruses are closely similar to those of the vertebrate relatives, with the additions of plant virus-specific movement proteins and RNAi suppressors that were likely acquired from plant (+)RNA viruses (Dolja and Koonin, 2011; Kormelink et al., 2011) . To explain this evolutionary pattern, it has been proposed that the plant (\u2212)RNA virome evolved via HVT from vertebrates mediated by arthropod vectors (Dolja and Koonin, 2011) .",

Analysis of the first solved 3D structure of a (\u2212)RNA virus RdRp, that of Bat influenza virus A, has unequivocally shown that not only this RdRp shared the fold with other virus RdRps and RTs, but that it appeared to be most similar to the flavivirus RdRps (Pflug et al., 2014) .

This notion is further supported by the evolutionary pattern whereby diverse invertebrates in the same ecological niche often share similar viruses, with incongruent virus and host phylogenies, again pointing to pervasive HVT and host promiscuity of invertebrate viruses (Li et al., 2015) .",

One of the two largest ones is the 'Mono-Chu clade' combining Mononegavirales with monopartite genomes and the Chuviruses, which possess monopartite or bipartite, apparently, circular genomes (Fig. 3A) . In the phylogenetic tree of the RdRps, the Chuvirus is the basal lineage, whereas in the rest of tree, the traditional families of vertebrate and plant mononegaviruses are buried within the dominant diversity of the invertebrate viruses, implying the ancestral status of the latter. In a remarkable instance of arthropod-transmitted plant viruses of the genus Cytorhabdovirus, such viruses as Persimmon virus A or Lettuce necrotic yellows virus have viruses of insects rather than other plant viruses as their closest kin. Together with the tendency of the plant rhabdoviruses to group according to their insect vectors rather than plant hosts (Kormelink et al., 2011) , this phylogenetic outcome clearly favors a relatively recent HVT of rhabdoviruses from insects to plants.",

Although most of the virus genomes in this clade possess 2 or 3 minus strand or ambisense genome segments, plant Tenuivirus have 4-6 segments. The 'Orthomyxo clade' of (\u2212)RNA viruses seems to show some affinity to the Bunya-Arena clade; fittingly, the genomes of orthomyxo-like viruses consist of 6-8 segments. In a phylogenetic pattern that is already too familiar from the preceding discussion of RNA virus evolution, the bona fide influenza viruses form but a twig deep within the RdRp phylogenetic tree that is full of invertebrate viruses, many of which were identified in insects. However, because the most basal of the orthomyxo-like viruses were identified in Lophotrochozoa (an earthworm and a mollusk), as well as in marine tunicates (early chordates), it seems that vertebrate influenza-like viruses might have evolved in marine invertebrates, were passed on to early chordates and then followed those during their terrestrialization.",

These viruses possess 2-3 genome segments and occupy intermediate positions between the Bunya-Arena/Orthomyxo and Mono-Chu clades. In contrast to the vast majority of enveloped (\u2212)RNA viruses, plant Ophyoviridae and Tenuivirus form atypical, non-enveloped helical, flexuous nucleocapsids similar to those of typical enveloped viruses (Kormelink et al., 2011) . Because of the thick plant cell walls that make plasma membranes inaccessible for interaction with the virus envelopes, it seems that these viruses simply shed the genes encoding glycoproteins and switched to the naked capsid lifestyle that is characteristic of most plant viruses. Thus, the large-scale metagenomics studies on invertebrate viruses point to these abundant and diverse eukaryotes as the hosts, in which (\u2212)RNA viruses have diversified and from which these viruses were transmitted to other complex eukaryotes, namely, vertebrates and plants (Fig. 3B) . Because the majority of the vertebrate and plant (\u2212) RNA viruses are arthropod-transmitted, this evolutionary trajectory appears to be effectively certain. Importantly, not only these viruses lack any prokaryotic relatives, but they are also conspicuously absent from the aquatic or protist viromes that have been sampled so far. Thus, a plausible origin of (\u2212)RNA viruses could date back to primitive metazoa or their early invertebrate descendants. A broader sampling of the most ancient diverging lineages of multicellular eukaryotes is needed to support or refute this hypothesis. What is even less certain, however, is where the gene modules that were recruited into ancestral (\u2212)RNA viruses come from. As discussed above, the more ancient (+) RNA or dsRNA viruses are potential sources of at least the RdRp of (\u2212) RNA viruses.",

The confidence in the major contribution of HVT in virus evolution differs between virus groups and the hosts. In particular, the huge, highly diverse plant RNA virome is densely populated by picorna-like, alpha-like, tombus-like, partiti-like, reo-like, bunya-like, rhabdo-like and some other clades of RNA viruses. Such massive RNA virome could have emerged by either vertical descent from the plant ancestral lineage of Zygnematophycea algae, or by HVT from the much more expansive invertebrate virome, or via a combination of these pathways. The small ancestral algal taxon appears unlikely to host all extant components of the flowering plant virome. Moreover, the algal virome is known to be dominated by Phycodnaviridae, large DNA viruses that are completely excluded from the plant virome. Thus, although some components of the plant virome could lurk in Zygnematophycea, the hypothesis that the RNA virome of plants flourished through HVT from marine environment via freshwater, soil and air routes seems to be preferable (Fig. 4) . Such HVT was likely mediated by nematodes, aquatic and soil inhabitants that are the most abundant animals on earth (Telford et al., 2008) , arthropods, and, perhaps to a smaller degree, mollusks and fungi.",

This role of invertebrates in virus evolution is compatible with the vector life style of many arthropods and nematodes. Apart from the vector transmission, HVT is clearly facilitated in aquatic, compared to terrestrial, environments, where viruses seem to be shuttled between highly diverse hosts such as various protists and animals. Accurate dating of the likely HVT events is problematic because of the likely changes in the evolutionary rates following a host switch.

            "text": "The new metaviromic data appear to support the three major routes through which the RNA viruses of eukaryotes have emerged and evolved. The first one, a continuous line of descent from (+)RNA bacteriophages, was taken by narna-like viruses whose RdRp is related to that of Leviviridae and some of which still reproduce in the mitochondria (Fig. 1B) . The second route, exemplified by the picorna-like viruses, involves assembly of the ancestral viral genome from genes derived from bacteria, their viruses and selfish elements (Fig. 2B ). Although the ultimate evolutionary provenance of picorna-like RdRp is not firmly established, it appears plausible that it evolved from the RT of bacterial Group II introns. The third route involves more recent origin of major groups of viruses; given the current lack of evidence of presence of (\u2212)RNA viruses, flavi-like viruses and alpha-like viruses in eukaryotes predating invertebrates, it appears likely that these groups of viruses emerged late in evolution, perhaps, at the root of the Metazoa (Fig. 3B) . As transpired upon deep sampling of invertebrate RNA viruses, all three routes seem to have converged during the extensive diversification of aquatic invertebrates yielding the vast invertebrate RNA pan-virome (Fig. 4) .",

As pointed out by Shi et al. (2017) , certain invertebrate taxa, in particular nematodes and arthropods, themselves represent major parts of the animal diversity, while being globally abundant and often living in extremely large and dense populations. Furthermore, many invertebrates are excellent HVT agents because they form tight biological associations with such organisms as vertebrates and plants, often serving as vectors that shuttle viruses between these organisms (Blanc and Gutierrez, 2015) .",

The first glimpses of the fungal virome show that it is richer than previously V.V. Dolja, E.V. Koonin Virus Research 244 (2018) 36-52 expected. Given that fungi are ubiquitous organisms whose diversity and population sizes could be comparable to or exceed those of invertebrates, future deep sampling of fungi for viruses potentially could reveal major contributions of fungi to the formation of the eukaryotic RNA pan-virome. We have to admit that, despite the transformative impact of metaviromics on our understanding of RNA virus evolution, a unifying scenario that would explain the relationships between (+)RNA, (\u2212) RNA, dsRNA and retroelements is still lacking. To develop such a grand scheme, major improvements are required in at least two directions: first, large-scale phylogenetic analysis of highly diverged proteins, such as the RdRps and RTs, and second, 'evolutionary viromics', a systematic study of the viromes of all major host taxa. Furthermore, the possibility remains that further trawling of metagenomes, especially with most powerful methods for sequence similarity detection, results in the discovery of completely new groups of viruses within what currently looks like \"dark matter\" of RNA metagenomes. Such findings would have the potential to dramatically change the picture of RNA virus evolution.",
