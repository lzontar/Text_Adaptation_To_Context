We did not have detailed information on all investigations because not all Epi-Aids International Epi-Aids, 1946-2005 S105 resulted in published papers. The categories used to classify the etiology of the investigations were mutually exclusive; however, investigations might have fallen into more than one category used. In addition, we might have underestimated the number of international investigations conducted by EISOs because field investigations and requests for technical assistance can be processed through means other than the Epi-Aid mechanism used for acute responses. Although we might not have captured all of the international activities performed by EISOs during the 60-year period, this review clearly demonstrates the depth and breadth of their response efforts globally. Through its field investigations, the EIS Program has served as an example to the global health community by showing how epidemiologic principles can be applied to address epidemic and nonepidemic conditions. Since 1980, approximately 40 countries, with support from CDC, have established Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) and FELTPs (59); all were modeled on CDC's EIS Program (60, 61) . Figure 1 indicates that FETPs have developed in each region in which Epi-Aids have been conducted. FETPs/FELTPs help to improve global public health capacity by developing a trained cadre of public health professionals in low-and mediumincome countries. Similar to the EIS Program, FETPs and FELTPs provide training in core public health competencies, including epidemiology, biostatistics, public health surveillance, laboratory practice, communication, computer technology, management and leadership, and prevention effectiveness (62) (63) (64) . CDC continues to provide financial support and technical assistance to 18 programs in 34 countries (includes regional programs) with FETPs and FELTPs (59) . Six other countries (Zimbabwe, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Brazil, and Egypt) were once supported by CDC but now have self-sustaining programs managed by the host country (59) .
