Within 3-1/2 months since outbreak in December 2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected across 206 countries with over 70,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60-140nm with mean size of the nano-aerosols, 100nm. The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95 and N98 at 300nm, to-date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants.

By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules, each separated by a permeable scrim material, the electrical interference was reduced, if not fully mitigated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter that further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amount of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer performance without incurring higher pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, and nano-aerosols from air pollution which lead to chronic diseases. [5]. This does not exclude also the possibility of the virus being attached to fine particles in the respiratory track or mouth of the infected person and got aerosolized during coughing, sneezing, speech and vomiting [6]. The aerosolization of virus may be one of the several causes that explains the sustained person-to-person spread of the COVID-19 in the world in such a short period of time. Interestingly, other than practicing social distancing and washing hands to keep disinfected, people wearing facemasks and respirators in the Far East, a deep rooted tradition, seem to have better control on the spread of COVID-19 as compared to the West where facemasks and respirators are less commonly used.

As the virus can be attached to particulates less than 100nm, the smallest size for the COVID-19 and its carrier (droplet or particle) can still be about 100nm. Can our current filtration technology provide adequate protection filtering out the airborne 100nm aerosol? The 100nm aerosol has been referred to as nano-aerosol, nanoparticle or ultrafine particle. While the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has standardized N95 and N98 respirator at 300nm, there is no standard filtration test for nanoaerosols at 100nm. The objective of the present study is to fill in this unmet need by developing effective new filtration technology target on this nano-aerosol size (i.e. 100nm) that represents the average size of COVID-19, as well as any other viruses including common cold/flu viruses, SARS and MERS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "There is no standard on personal protection gear, such as facemask, on filtering 100nm, it can be safe to set an objective of this study being to develop a filter/mask that can provide at least 90% filtration efficiency for the 100nm nano-aerosols but with pressure drop less than 30Pa at 5.3 cm/s face velocity.

This applies more to the PM0.1, which is even smaller. Despite this, the high concentration of PM1 and more so the PM0.1 can penetrate deeply in our body [8] . Indeed, it has been reported nanoaerosols of 41nm were found in the erythrocyte in the capillary lumen and 81 nm particle in the cytoplasm of a capillary endothelial cell in the lung [9] . In fact, when nano-aerosols enter the blood stream they can be transported to various organs, including to our central nervous system and even having adverse effect on our brain [8]. Indeed, nano-aerosols are also present in large number concentrations, about 200 million per cubic meter, from road emission [10].

This is much smaller than 20-40 gsm being used for facemasks with microfibers of diameter 2 -20 \uf06dm. However, the pressure drop can be significant for nanofiber filters as the theoretical pressure drop \uf044p \uf0b5 1/d f 2 according to the Davis' equation [13] established experimentally for microfibers. If this holds, then it is expected the pressure drop is at least 100X more for nanofibers with the same basis weight (i.e. gsm). Other than the large specific surface of nanofibers that lead to high pressure drop, another factor leading to pressure drop is the smaller pores (on the order several micrometers or less depending on the gsm of the nanofibers) of the nanofiber mat versus the larger pores (tens of micrometers) for the microfiber mat.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 113, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 533, "end": 537, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Nanofiber"}, {"text": "One novel approach to reduce pressure drop is to distribute the same amounts of nanofibers to achieve a certain efficiency into multiple layers (or multiple modules) with each thin nanofiber layer laid on a permeable substrate (a module) with large permeable macropores [14] inter-dispersed in the filter stack.

There have been various attempts to charge the nanofibers in the past [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , but in most of the situations the charges decay within a day and the stability of the charges implanted in the nanofiber becomes the biggest challenge. Recently, we have been able to charge the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber mat using corona discharge [21, 22] . The electrostatic charges can stay for 3 months with only 1% reduction in filtration efficiency, which is extremely promising. This is due to using corona discharge charging the nanofibers by implanting more stable space charges in the nanofiber mat. In that study, comparison was made on the single fiber efficiency based on the nanofiber filter with microfiber filters having fiber diameter 10-20\uf06dm . It was found that the single-fiber efficiency due to the charged nanofiber is much more superior. Unfortunately, in the study the average fiber diameter was held fixed at 450nm [21] . It is expected that a stronger electric field can greatly affect dielectrophoresis, i.e. first inducing dipoles on approaching neutrally charged aerosols and subsequently attracting the charged aerosol by the charged fiber by interacting with the opposite charge of the dipole on the particle. This leads to an interesting issue that if the fiber diameter is made smaller, would the charged fiber in the nanofiber mat more superior having stronger electric field (given E\uf0b51/R 2 where E is the electric field and R is the distance from the axis of the fiber to the particle)? On the other hand, as the fiber diameter is being reduced, pressure drop also increases. If the pressure drop indeed follows inversely to the quadratic power of the fiber diameter in accordance to Davis' equation, one may be limited in reducing the nanofiber diameter. Perhaps, there may be an optimum for which the fiber diameter is sufficiently small providing strong enough electric field to effect dielectrophoresis, yet the pressure drop is still acceptable.

The pressure drop behaviour revealed that as the fiber diameter increased, \uf044p decreased inversely with the fiber diameter d f and not inversely as the quadratic power of the fiber diameter as suggested by Davis equation[13]! On the other hand, dimensional analysis with \uf044p, d f , \uf06d, u and h showed that the dimensionless pressure drop should be, which implied that \uf044p\uf07e1/d f 2 . But, with nanofiber and nanoscale flow it was possible that the mean free path of air \uf06c also came into play, especially for flow with dimension scale near \uf06c for which there could be significant slip flow. Flow inside the nanofiber which has diameter of 84-500nm were of order comparable to \uf06c which at standard temperature and pressure was approximately 66nm. In other words, the dimensional analysis should also include the variables: \uf044p, d f , \uf06d, u, \uf06c and h. Therefore, we may end up with This could explain why \uf044p\uf07e1/d f . This was an important finding as we could design filters with smaller fiber diameter in multilayer arrangement without severely being penalized with high pressure drop as dictated by the inverse quadratic dependence of fiber diameter. Therefore, to target at 95% and lower pressure drop, we could use 0.096gsm as the basic module in the multilayer configuration and design filter with either 191nm or even 84nm fiber diameter and it might be possible to achieve much higher filtration efficiency for the nano-aerosols.

By reducing the basis weight in the module from 0.191gsm to 0.096gsm and doubling the number of layers to compensate for the reduced basis weight, the performance could be significantly increased. This was demonstrated for the 349-nm fiber filter. Also, the QF stayed relatively constant along the iso-QF curve. This strategy could be applied for optimizing the 200-nm fiber filter in the future. For the large diameter fiber, such as 525nm, increasing the basis weight from 0.191gsm to 0.745gsm did not increase substantially the pressure drop, but could boost-up significantly the capture efficiency by electrostatic mechanism.The pressure drop decreased inversely with increasing fiber diameter.
