It is also important to note that school closures without simultaneous social distancing means that children gather in parks, libraries, and other facilities and could still transmit to each other and fuel spread in the community. At the time of this writing, much of the debate around social distancing has focused on how long these measures need to be implemented and what should be expected in terms of new cases once social distancing recommendations are lifted. 4, 7 Many of these questions were posed back in 2009, when the pandemic of infection with the hemagglutinin type 1 and neuraminidase type 1 (H1N1) influenza strain emerged to cause similar global disruption, albeit with less severe clinical illness. 8 The purposes of this commentary were to review the events of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic emergence, to examine how only limited school closures with minimal social distancing were implemented, and to offer a discussion about the likelihood of subsequent waves of COVID cases once these measures lapse.",

During a typical influenza season (eg, 2015e2016), activity starts in late November and December, peaks in January and February, and tapers off by March and April (Fig. 1 , part A). 9 In sharp contrast, the onset of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic came in late March, with many respiratory illnesses being reported in Mexico and then spreading to the United States and other parts of the world over the next several weeks (Fig. 1 , part B). 9e11 The onset of infections in early spring caused several school-based outbreaks in New York City and other areas. 12 Individual schools did close, but early cases never matched the explosive spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the focused geographic activity of 2009 H1N1 and because schools would be adjourning for summer break, national school closures were never seriously considered. While social distancing was discussed as part of a general public health strategy for managing a pandemic, no specific measures were put into place. 8 The other issue with emerging in late March was that the pandemic occurred almost 2 months after global decisions about strain selection for the 2009e2010 seasonal influenza vaccines were made. A pandemic vaccine would need to have been prepared in parallel to the seasonal vaccine, with a lag of about 2 months, assuming no delays. No other community-based preventive measures were put into place beyond the accelerated pace of trying to produce a pandemic vaccine.",

A study showed that school closures instituted in the fall had no impact on transmission. 14 New infections continued until November and early December before tapering off. The irony of the situation was that the massive efforts were put forth to create an H1N1 vaccine, but the initial strains did not grow well, and vaccine production was delayed by several weeks. 15 By the time a vaccine was available in November and early December, the pool of susceptible children had likely been depleted and peak activity had long since passed.",

            "text": "It is important to acknowledge major differences between the circumstances of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic. First, a global influenza pandemic was a known commodity, something the international community had experienced in the past and expected to return in the future. While the initial SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 temporarily grabbed the world's attention, it petered out within a few months, never to return. 16 Therefore, this SARS-CoV2 virus was not an outbreak that the world had anticipated, which has hampered the rapid response required for better containment. Second, because influenza is a global and consistent seasonal health problem, there is an established infrastructure for surveillance, prevention, and treatment that can be applied to any new pandemic strain. Public health officials know they can collaborate with industry partners to create a vaccine within a few months, and indeed this did happen in 2009, albeit too late to impact the second wave of cases. There is no existing vaccine or treatment infrastructure for coronavirus, so all candidates must start with Phase I studies or the rapidly conducted, but highly flawed, open-label treatment studies that are being rapidly published and disseminated. 17, 18 Assuming no major adverse events, good efficacy, and easy Phase I and II testing, it will be at least a year before a vaccine candidate would be ready for use in the general population. Last, varying levels of influenza immunity exist in the community and help to limit the spread and severity of circulating strains. For example, in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the elderly were relatively protected because they had archived immunity to H1N1 epitopes after having been exposed to the similar 1918 strain earlier in life. 19 Aside from those already infected with SARS-CoV2, the entire population is na\u00efve and at risk for infection. While it is possible that there may be some degree of cross-protection with other coronaviruses, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV2 suggests otherwise.",

            "text": "With all that being said, there are still important lessons that can be drawn from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic experience. The first are the expected effects of social distancing and a potential second wave of cases. Schools did not close initially in 2009 due to summer being near at hand. The influenza surveillance data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fig. 1, part B ) demonstrated that there was ongoing person-to-person transmission during the summer, when typically there is no detectable activity. Once widespread close contact in schools was reestablished, children with H1N1 infected other children, who subsequently spread influenza to adult contacts, and influenza cases surged. Once the fall peak of cases was underway, school closures implemented at that time had no impact on transmission or total flu cases. 14 Data from the 1918 pandemic suggest that US cities that instituted social distancing and school closures earlier and for a longer period of time had fewer overall cases and better economic outcomes in the long term. 20, 21 It is very likely that once social distancing measures are lifted for COVID-19, and school or summer activities resume, there will be a second wave of cases. This second wave has already been seen in Hong Kong. 5 Given how immune-na\u00efve the population is to this virus, and given how SARS-CoV2 has proven to be much more contagious than seasonal influenza, a second wave of cases is a virtual certainty. 22, 23 The goal of social distancing is to blunt the first wave and allow the medical system time to manage cases without being overwhelmed. Over time, with widespread testing and prompt diagnosis, social distancing could transition to a more targeted cohorting of infected persons and \"cocooning\" isolation of highly susceptible people, such as the elderly and those with chronic respiratory and/or cardiovascular conditions. Sadly, it appears that the social distancing and school closures were implemented too late and in too regional a fashion to allow for optimal containment. 24 ",
