It is common practice for healthcare workers to interview individuals diagnosed with a communicable disease about their recent movements in order to identify and alert others who they may have come in contact with. This process is referred to as contact tracing and is crucial as health entities, communities and governments attempt to contain viral outbreaks. Manually performing contact tracing is highly resource-intensive, intrusive and time-consuming. Yet the ubiquitous use of personal digital devices provides access to detailed location histories that are collected automatically, enabling a system that could conduct this process at scale. The objective of this paper is to describe such a system in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic that better preserves the privacy of its users than the systems we see governments adopting.",

Instead of recording user location histories, these systems record when users come in proximity of one another. A user's smartphone application generates, and periodically updates, a random identifier called a \"contact event number\" (CEN). The user's device broadcasts this CEN using Bluetooth Low Energy and receives and locally records CENs broadcast by other users' devices. Users who later fall ill then share their CENs, which can be matched against the CENs recorded locally by other users to identify points of contact between diagnosed users and the other users. The different implementations vary in the privacy and security they provide their users. For example, the Singapore government requires users of its TraceTogether app to share their phone numbers and identities with a central authority that maintains a database of recorded CENs. This authority contacts users whose recorded CENs match against diagnosed users' CENs to alert them of their exposure. This system provides users with no privacy from the central authority but does protect users from having their identities exposed to other users. In contrast, the COVID-Watch and CoEpi projects place more trust in users rather than in a central authority. 4 With their designs, diagnosed users' CENs are stored in a database that is either made public for other users' apps to download or made available for them to poll [13, 14] . These models are not perfectly privacy-preserving either, as they are susceptible to privacy attacks from other users, as described by Cho et al. [15] .",

Similarly COVID-19 surveillance innovations in China are likely to be used by China's counterterrorism forces beyond the pandemic to further monitor and regulate the movement of its people. Consider the Uighur people. The Chinese government has categorized this ethnic group as terrorists and has subjected many of them to forced labor [22] . 8 Phones collect GPS data with limited accuracy and therefore trying to match users across spatial areas with radii too small will miss points of contact. 9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash 10 https://h3geo.org/ on. The 3-dimensional grid of point intervals is an underlying system parameter (or logical \"map\") that is agreed-upon and shared across all user devices in the system. The specific partition scheme and interval sizes used are implementation details. What matters more is that the chosen partition scheme and the geographic and temporal resolution used are consistent across devices.",

We assume that there is a semi-trusted authority (e.g. a local health agency) operating a server. When a patient is diagnosed as a disease carrier, they share their redacted, anonymized, hashed point intervals to the central server. Other users' apps periodically exchange information about their own hashed point intervals with the server to detect if their hashed point intervals match against those shared by diagnosed carriers. They do so with a private set intersection protocol. 11 Technical note about matching against adjacent intervals: Since the partition of geographic space into intervals was predetermined, two points may be close together in space but fall into different intervals. For this reason a user's app checks each of their collected point intervals, as well as the spatially adjacent intervals against the diagnosed carriers' shared point intervals. That is, if we use a spatial grid of hexagons (like H3), a user's collected point falls within a grid cell and that grid cell is used as an interval. We must check that interval as well as the surrounding 6 hexagons in the grid against each data point shared by diagnosed carriers.

These partner applications can then ask the user for the extra permissions and consent for this system's use case. There are many such applications that already collect user location histories in the background. They often use this information to serve the user more relevant advertisements and content.

At the same time, we must avoid building any new surveillance systems to serve as short-term emergency measures that can last beyond a time of crisis. This protocol allows for flexibility in terms of whether it allows a client to learn which of its points have matches versus how many of its points have matches. At step (3) of the protocol the server further encrypts the data received from the client, H(PU)a, and returns H(PU)ab. If the server maintains the order in the sequence of points intervals, then the client can then learn exactly which hashed point intervals in the sequence it sent to the server, H(P U ) a = [H(p U 1 ) a , H(p U 1 ) a , ...H(p U n ) a ] match against items in the server's encrypted data, H(P I ) ba .

            "text": "A An example private set intersection protocol using Diffie-Hellman Below we outline an example of how our system would work with a simple Diffie-Hellman PSI protocol. Note that the actual implementation may differ from this example. Our description assumes familiarity with Diffie-Hellman, modular arithmetic and concepts from cryptography such as the discrete log problem. Readers can otherwise skip this section to the PSI protocol summary below. Before we walk through this PSI protocol, we clarify the problem and notation.Notation and Problem Statement: We call a point interval p, and a collected sequence of point intervals P = [p 1 , p 2 , ...]. We call the users' point intervals that are collected by their device P U . We call the point intervals collected for diagnosed carriers and later shared with the server P I . As we noted earlier, each point interval is encrypted by a commonly shared deterministic hash function, which we call H. This means that a user's phone really stores H(P U ) = [H(p U 1 ), H(p U 1 ), ...H(p U n )], and the server storesIf a user has a point interval matching one shared by a diagnosed carrier, i.e. p U i = p Ij for some p U i in P U collected by the user's device, and some p Ij in P I collected by a diagnosed carriers' device and later shared to the server, then the encrypted hashes of these point intervals match as well.Consider H(P U ) as a set which is stored on the user's device, and H(P I ) as a set stored on the server. The problem is then to allow the user's app to learn the set intersection of H(P U ) and H(P I ).Protocol: Our described use of Diffie-Hellman is written with the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, where p is prime, and g is a primitive root modulo p.Setup: The server and the client user's device have an agreed upon modulus, p, and base of the multiplicative group, g. The server and client each generate secret private keys, a and b, respectively.",
