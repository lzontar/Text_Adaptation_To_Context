Although the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 remains uncertain, it may serve as a potential prophylactic agent especially in those at high risk, such as healthcare workers, household contacts of infected patients, and the immunocompromised. Our aim was to identify possible hydroxychloroquine dosing regimens through simulation in those at high risk of infections by optimizing exposures above the in vitro generated half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) and to help guide researchers in dose-selection for COVID-19 prophylactic studies. To maintain weekly troughs above EC 50 in > 50% of subjects at steady-state in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, an 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg twice or 3 times weekly is required. In an exposure driven, postexposure prophylaxis setting, 800 mg loading dose followed in 6 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days achieved daily troughs above EC 50 in > 50% subjects. These doses are higher than recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, and clinical trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy.",

There is no approved therapy for COVID-19, and a number of trials have been initiated, including hydroxychloroquine, losartan, remdesivir, tocilizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, and convalescent plasma. 1 There are > 100 recruiting or not yet recruiting treatment studies listed on clinicaltrials.gov as of March 29, 2020. Although reports have surfaced regarding the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used in malaria, the efficacy for COVID-19 remains uncertain. Hydroxychloroquine has known in vitro activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. However, the half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) for SARS-CoV-2 virus is different than for malaria with a > 20fold higher in vitro EC 50 of hydroxychloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 vs. malaria. EC 50 values for SARS-CoV-2 virus in the literature have ranged from 0.72-17.31 \u03bcM, with higher EC 50 values generally associated with higher multiplicity of infections, indicative of a potential need for greater systemic exposure for the higher viral loads. 2, 3 Hydroxychloroquine is also proposed as a prophylactic agent in those at high risk, such as healthcare workers, the immunocompromised, and household contacts of infected individuals. Oral hydroxychloroquine was authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 28, 2020, to treat adult and adolescent patients who weigh 50 kg or more hospitalized with \uf0fe These findings are intended to guide the research community in optimizing dose selection for COVID-19 prevention and early treatment trials.

Choosing the correct dose for a clinical trial needs to consider the risk of toxicities but also ensure the best chance of successful achievement of therapeutic targets.

The median and 90th percentile of hydroxychloroquine simulated concentrations (n = 1,000 subjects) over time were calculated. The percent of subjects with troughs above the SARS-CoV-2 target concentration (EC 50 0.72 \u03bcM) 3 and median time above target were reported. For the pre-exposure simulations, weekly troughs are reported, whereas for post-exposure simulations daily troughs are reported. Because prophylaxis would be given before high viral loads are achieved, we targeted the lower range EC 50 of 0.72 \u03bcM 3 and aimed to keep at least 50% of subjects above this target. For the post-exposure and pre-emptive treatment settings, we simulated exposures over 14 days to represent a typical incubation time for SARS-CoV-2. 8 We simulated the current FDA approved dosing for malaria treatment (800 mg followed by 400 mg at 6, 24, and 48 hours after the initial dose, a total of 3 days) and prophylaxis (400 mg weekly) and other regimens, such as those tested in recent COVID-19 trials (i.e., 400 mg/day for 5 days or 200 mg 3 times daily for 6 days). 9, 10 We also tested recommended regimens against an EC 50 target of 1.44 \u03bcM to account for potential differences in vitro and plasma protein binding. 11 ",

Simulations of once-weekly dosing predicted that only 3% of subjects would have troughs above the target per week once steady-state is reached ( Table 1) . For the FDA recommended treatment dose of malaria (800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg daily for a total of 3 days), simulations predicted 89% of subjects would have troughs above the target on day 1, however, this number dropped to 7% by day 14 post-exposure after the start of prophylaxis ( Table 1) .",

Notably, therapeutic effect may be maintained even longer, as preclinical models have demonstrated up to 30-fold accumulation of hydroxychloroquine in lung tissue. 12 Similar to what has been proposed for treatment by other groups, 4,5 our simulations suggest higher treatment and prophylactic doses for COVID-19 may be needed than those recommended for malaria. This is consistent with the > 20-fold lower in vitro EC 50 for malaria compared with SARS-CoV-2. 13 Unlike with malaria, where dosing is recommended to start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area, prevention for COVID-19 requires more rapid attainment of therapeutic concentrations, thus supporting the rationale for a loading dose in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. Although, in general, hydroxychloroquine is a well-tolerated drug, increasing the dose may come with untoward effects that should be Table 1 Percentage of simulated subjects with troughs above targeted EC 50 and median cumulative time above targeted EC 50 (0.72 \u03bcM), by the end of each prophylactic durations, for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis a Pre-exposure prophylaxis, 12-week simulation duration",

Hydroxychloroquine systemic severe adverse effects include retinal-toxicity and cardiotoxicity, however, these toxicities are mostly associated with daily and/or long-term use. We chose to simulate total plasma concentrations, as the in vitro generated EC 50 was not protein-adjusted yet, it was performed in the presence of protein. 3 Previous studies have shown that in vitro protein binding can occur in the presence of added protein but may not be equal to plasma protein-binding that may be observed clinically in humans. 14 Therefore, we also evaluated our regimens against 1.44 \u03bcM EC 50 , which would assume no in vitro protein binding (i.e., most extreme scenario) and found that higher dosing would likely be required in the pre-exposure setting, whereas the post-exposure regimen performed reasonably, although target concentrations were not maintained as long. If higher EC 50 targets are required, dosing may exceed the therapeutic index, although this is largely unknown for hydroxychloroquine in the context of COVID-19. Notably, for many infections (e.g., malaria, influenza, and pneumocystis pneumonia), dosing for prophylaxis are substantially lower than those used for treatment but yet are highly effective.",

This modest success is consistent with our model simulations. In contrast, a study performed in China tested 5 days of 400 mg/day and observed no difference between treatment and control groups, with 13 of 15 vs. 14 of 15 achieving viral negative swabs by day 7. 9 Our simulations have shown that 5 days of 400 mg without a loading dose was not sufficient to maintain daily troughs above the EC 50 in 50% of the subjects for 14 days. Furthermore, patients with active COVID-19 disease may require a different efficacy target due to higher viral loads.",
