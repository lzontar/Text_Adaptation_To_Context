            "text": "Analysis of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant viruses is a classic method allowing researchers to identify genetic loci involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. Here, we report genetic analysis of a ts strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), tsNC11, focusing on the role of mutations in the macrodomain (MAC) and the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the viral replication complex. Using MHV reverse genetics, we generated a series of mutant viruses to define the contributions of macrodomain-and PLP2specific mutations to the ts phenotype. Viral replication kinetics and efficiency-ofplating analysis performed at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures revealed that changes in the macrodomain alone were both necessary and sufficient for the ts phenotype. Interestingly, mutations in the PLP2 domain were not responsible for the temperature sensitivity but did reduce the frequency of reversion of macrodomain mutants. Coimmunoprecipitation studies are consistent with an interaction between the macrodomain and PLP2. Expression studies of the macrodomain-PLP2 portion of nsp3 indicate that the ts mutations enhance proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein. Furthermore, we found that during virus infection, the replicase proteins containing the MAC and PLP2 mutations were more rapidly degraded at the nonpermissive temperature than were the wild-type proteins. Importantly, we show that the macrodomain and PLP2 mutant viruses trigger production of type I interferon in vitro and are attenuated in mice, further highlighting the importance of the macrodomain-PLP2 interplay in viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emerging human and veterinary pathogens with pandemic potential. Despite the established and predicted threat these viruses pose to human health, there are currently no approved countermeasures to control infections with these viruses in humans. Viral macrodomains, enzymes that remove posttranslational ADP-ribosylation of proteins, and viral multifunctional papain-like proteases, enzymes that cleave polyproteins and remove polyubiquitin chains via deubiquitinating activity, are two important virulence factors. Here, we reveal an unanticipated interplay between the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain that is important for replication and antagonizing the host innate immune response. Targeting the interaction of these enzymes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to treat CoV disease.",

Replication of the virus initiates with the engagement of the spike glycoprotein with a host cell receptor and the release of the positive-sense RNA into the cytoplasm of the cell. The large (\u03f332-kb) viral genomic RNA is translated to produce two long polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed by viral proteases, including the papain-like proteases (PLP1 and/or PLP2) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro or Mpro), into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16, Fig. 1A ). To generate the viral replication complex, the coronaviral nsp's sequester host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate convoluted membranes and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are the sites of viral RNA synthesis (3, 4) . The viral replication complex generates a nested set of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates to produce copious amounts of mRNAs, which are then translated to produce the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and virusspecific accessory proteins. The genomic RNA and structural proteins assemble in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment to generate infectious virus particles that are released from the cell (5, 6) .",

As a result, CoVs have evolved multiple strategies to counteract and delay activation of these host immune responses and establish an environment amenable to virus replication. These strategies include (i) expressing species-specific accessory proteins as modulators of innate immune responses (reviewed in reference 7), (ii) encoding highly conserved nonstructural proteins that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists (8) (9) (10) , and (iii) sequestering viral RNA in DMVs (3, 4) to prevent detection by host pattern recognition receptors. A key component in the assembly of the DMVs is nsp3 (11, 12) . To date, eleven distinct nsp3 domains have been identified using either bioinformatic approaches or enzymatic studies (Fig. 1A) . Here, we focus on two multifunctional components contained within nsp3, the macrodomain (MAC) and papain-like protease 2 (PLP2).",

Structural and biochemical studies revealed that the X domain exhibited structural similarity to the cellular histone MacroH2a and catalyzed measurable ADP-ribose-1\u0409-phosphatase (ADRP) activity (16) (17) (18) , although the functional significance of this enzymatic activity was unclear. Using reverse genetics to inactivate the catalytic site of the enzyme, researchers found that ADRP activity was not essential for CoV replication in cultured cells (19) . However, further studies revealed that an ADRPcatalytic mutant virus was attenuated in mice (20) and that ADRP activity in SARS-CoV and human CoV-229E mediated resistance to antiviral interferon responses (21) . These findings were consistent with an essential role for enzymatic activity in vivo, although the target for the ADRP activity was still unclear. A breakthrough came in 2016 from a study revealing that the macrodomain of HEV acts as an ADP-ribose hydrolase (22) . ADP-ribosylation is a known posttranslational modification that regulates cellular activities (23); therefore, viral enzymes that reverse this process could interrupt host cell signaling. For CoVs, nsp3 macrodomain activity was shown to promote MHV-induced encephalitis (24) and increase virulence during SARS-CoV infection (25) .",

For MHV, PLP2 is responsible for processing the nsp3/4 junction using a highly conserved LXGG/X cleavage site (26) . Studies using SARS-CoV revealed that the single papain-like protease encoded on nsp3 (termed PLpro) cleaves all three sites at the amino-terminal end of the polyprotein (27) . PLpro also functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) which is capable of removing polyubiquitin chains from substrates (28, 29 revealed that CoV PLpro/PLP2s are multifunctional, with protease, deubiquitinating, and deISGylating activities (30) (31) (32) (33) . Viral DUB activity has been implicated as a modulator of the innate immune response to viral infection (32, 34, 35) , but the target(s) of the DUB activity has not yet been identified. Thus, both the PLP2 and macrodomains of nsp3 have been independently identified as contributors to coronavirus virulence. In this study, we characterized a temperature-sensitive (ts) MHV mutant virus containing mutations within both the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain. We investigated the contributions of these mutations to the temperature-sensitive phenotype, as well as the resulting effects on viral pathogenesis. The results presented here reveal a previously undescribed interplay between the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain that impacts replication, antagonizes the innate immune response, and contributes to viral pathogenesis. Modulating the macrodomain-PLP2 interaction may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.",

Complementation analysis indicated that tsNC11 harbors mutations in the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) region of the replicase polyprotein, but the specific mutations were unknown. To identify the nucleotide changes in tsNC11, we isolated the genomic RNA from the viral supernatant, subjected it to deep sequencing, and then aligned the reads to the genomic sequence of MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) (GenBank accession no. AY910861). In agreement with the complementation study by Schaad et al. (36) , the sequence analysis revealed seven nonsynonymous substitutions in ORF1a of tsNC11. These substitutions resulted in 7 amino acid (aa) changes: two in nsp2 (I4V and T543I), four in nsp3, and one in nsp10 (P23S). The four mutations within nsp3 are distributed between the macrodomain (K532E and G554D) and the PLP2 domain (D1026N and D1071N) (Fig. 1A ). As noted above, previous studies documented the importance of the macrodomain and PLP2 domain in virus replication and disease; therefore, we focused our efforts on evaluating how these substitutions contributed to the ts phenotype, the stability of the phenotype, and the pathogenesis of the virus in mice.",

As expected, all viruses replicated to high titers and formed similarly sized plaques at 32\u00b0C (Fig. 2 , upper panel). tsNC11 is profoundly temperature sensitive, with a low number of plaques detected at the 10 \u03ea1 dilution on the plate incubated at the nonpermissive temperature. The tsNC11 plaques that were detected at the nonpermissive temperature exhibited a large-plaque phenotype, suggesting that these viruses may be revertants. We found that the PLP2mut virus formed large plaques at 40\u00b0C, which is consistent with the results of the kinetic analysis and indicates that the mutations in the PLP2 domain are not sufficient to cause the ts phenotype. Analysis of the MACmut virus revealed a mixed population of small and large plaques at the nonpermissive temperature, the majority of which displayed the small-plaque phenotype. The MAC/PLP2 mutant virus mirrored the plaque size and plating efficiency of tsNC11. We calculated the EOP values, which represent the ratio of viral titers obtained at 40\u00b0C and at 32\u00b0C (Fig. 2B) . Again, the PLP2mut and icWT viruses had similar titers at both temperatures, resulting in an EOP of \u03f31. In contrast, the MACmut virus exhibited titers that were significantly lower at 40\u00b0C than the titers obtained at 32\u00b0C (EOP of 10 \u03ea2 ). These results indicate that the MACmut virus, but not the PLP2mut or icWT viruses, has a defect in plaque formation at the nonpermissive temperature. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the mutations in the macrodomain, but not those in the PLP2 domain, are the major determinants of the ts phenotype of tsNC11. In addition, these results are consistent with a critical role of the macrodomain in viral replication. Interestingly, we found that the MAC/PLP2 mutant virus mirrored the plaque size and low reversion frequency of tsNC11 (EOP of 10 \u03ea5 ), supporting a role for the PLP2 domain as a genetic enhancer of the ts phenotype. A genetic enhancer, as defined by genetic studies of eukaryotic organisms, is a mutation in one gene that intensifies the phenotype caused by a mutation in another gene (38) .",

While generating the MACmut virus, we noticed that, in addition to the majority population having the small-plaque phenotype, a subpopulation of large plaques was also present at 40\u00b0C. The large plaques consistently appeared even after several rounds of plaque purification of the small-plaque isolates. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the small plaques were formed by temperature-sensitive viruses while the large plaques were due to revertant viruses. To address this question, we selectively isolated plaques with different sizes and propagated them at 32\u00b0C to obtain viral stocks for subsequent analysis (Fig. 3 ). We found that the small-plaque isolates recapitulated the phenotype of the parental MACmut virus: small plaques and similar EOP values (Fig. 3A ). In contrast, the large-plaque isolates exhibited a phenotype similar to that of icWT. Sequencing results of PCR amplicons, representing the region spanning the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain, revealed that small-plaque isolates had no additional mutations in either the macrodomain or PLP2. In contrast, the large-plaque isolates had either a true reversion (D554 to G) or harbored putative suppressive mutations located within the macrodomain or the adjacent downstream sequence (Fig. 3B ). Among seven large-plaque revertants, all maintained the K532E mutation, indicating it was not associated with the ts phenotype. Three isolates had the D554-to-G reversion, suggesting that it may be sufficient for the ts phenotype of the MACmut virus. We found that isolates 4 to 7 maintained the engineered mutations but had also acquired additional, potentially suppressive mutations in the downstream region. Together, these results indicate that altering the coding sequence of either the macrodomain or the downstream region is likely sufficient to revert or suppress the ts phenotype caused by the G554D mutation. We also evaluated the MAC-PLP2 region of tsNC11 large-plaque revertant viruses and found that all three isolates had the D554-to-G reversion (Fig. 3C) , consistent with our findings with the MACmut revertants.",

We determined that the macrodomain mutations are the major contributors to the ts phenotype; however, we noticed that the MACmut virus did not completely phenocopy tsNC11. We found that the replication of the MACmut virus was defective at 40\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C. In addition, the MACmut virus exhibited a higher EOP value (10 \u03ea2 ) than that of tsNC11 (10 \u03ea4 ) (Fig. 2B) , indicating a relatively high reversion frequency. These data imply that mutations outside the macrodomain may enhance the ts phenotype by stabilizing the replication defect, thereby preventing reversion to the wild-type phenotype (38) . Therefore, we sought to determine whether the addition of the PLP2 mutations observed in tsNC11 could enhance the ts phenotype of the MACmut virus and reduce reversion. We found that the MAC/PLP2mut virus exhibits a severe replication defect at both 37 and 40\u00b0C (Fig. 1B) and replicated only under permissive conditions, similar to tsNC11. The MAC/PLP2mut and tsNC11 viruses exhibited similar EOP values (\u03f310 \u03ea4 ) (Fig. 2B ). Of note, the low titer of the MAC/PLP2mut virus at 40\u00b0C indicates a low level of reversion to the wild-type phenotype, suggesting that the PLP2 mutations stabilize the MACmut virus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while the PLP2 mutations are not sufficient to cause the ts phenotype, they act to enhance the ts phenotype caused by the mutation in the macrodomain. Enhancement of phenotypes has been described for other coronavirus interacting proteins (39, 40) , which motivated us to determine whether the enhancement phenotype we detected here is due to an interaction between the macro and PLP2 domains.",

The structures of several domains of nsp3 have been solved individually (reviewed in reference 41) or in combination (42) .

The capacity of the PLP2 mutations to enhance the ts phenotype in the presence of the macrodomain mutations raises the possibility of domain-domain interaction between the macrodomain and PLP2. To test this hypothesis, we generated plasmids that express either an epitope-tagged macrodomain (HA-MAC) or PLP2 domain (PLP2-V5) (depicted in Fig. 4A ). When these plasmids were cotransfected into HEK-293T cells, expression of both the macrodomain and PLP2 was detectable by the cognate epitope antibodies (Fig. 4B ). We detected HA-MAC in lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-V5, and inversely, PLP2-V5 was detected when HA-MAC was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. These results indicate that the ectopically expressed macrodomain associates with PLP2 in cell lysates, consistent with either a direct or indirect interaction.",

The MAC/PLP2 (WT) protein was maintained at levels comparable to those prior to treatment up to 5 h posttreatment with CHX. In contrast, we detected rapid reductions in the levels of all of the mutant forms of the protein. Addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked degradation of the proteins (Fig. 5B and C) .

Previous studies have shown that the papain-like protease domains of MHV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV antagonize the IFN response, likely through the deubiquitinating activity of these enzymes (32, 34, 35, (43) (44) (45) (46) . In addition, coronaviral macrodomains have been shown to suppress IFN production both in vitro and in vivo (20, 21, 24, 25) . We sought to determine whether the mutations in the macrodomain and PLP2 modulate the type I interferon response during infection of macrophages. As shown in Fig. 7A , infection of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with mutant viruses at the permissive temperature produced significantly more IFN-\u2423 during infection than icWT virus infection. At 12 h postinfection, the MACmut virus induced 2-fold more IFN-\u2423 than icWT virus. Furthermore, the level of N gene transcripts, which reveals the abundances of all viral mRNAs, was reduced in the MACmut-infected cells compared to that for the wild-type virus. We found that the PLP2mut virus elicited Because the ts mutant viruses had reduced replication efficiency and elicited type I IFN production during infection of macrophages, we were interested in evaluating the pathogenicity of these viruses. To this end, C57BL/6 mice were intracranially inoculated with 600 PFU of virus and monitored for weight loss and mortality. As shown in Fig. 7B , all WT virus-infected mice lost weight rapidly and succumbed to infection by day 11 postinfection. In contrast, the mutant virus-infected mice exhibited transient or no weight loss during the infection period and all mice survived. These results demonstrate that the ts mutant viruses are attenuated in vivo, and those mutations adjacent to the catalytic sites of the macrodomains and PLP2 domains can modulate viral pathogenesis.",

Here, we described an unanticipated interplay between two previously characterized virulence factors, the macrodomain and the papain-like protease, of coronaviruses. The enzymatic activities of these domains have been implicated in removing posttranslational modifications: macrodomains remove mono-or poly-ADP-ribose from proteins (18, 22, 23) , and the deubiquitinating activity of viral papain-like proteases removes mono-or polyubiquitin chains from signaling proteins (30, 32, 47) . Our study stems from characterizing a temperature-sensitive mutant virus that harbored mutations within both the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain of nsp3. We found that the mutation within the macrodomain (G554D) was associated with the most significant temperature-sensitive phenotype but that this alteration of the macrodomain reverted to the wild-type phenotype at high frequency. However, viruses containing mutations in both the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain reverted less frequently, consistent with the PLP2 domain having an enhancing effect on the ts phenotype. Although these two enzymes reside within the same nsp3 polypeptide (Fig. 1A) , to our knowledge this is the first suggestion of an interplay between these domains. By expressing the macrodomain and papain-like protease 2 domain on independent expression plasmids, we were able to evaluate and detect coimmunoprecipitation of the proteins, which is consistent with either a direct or an indirect interaction. Furthermore, we report that the mutations identified in the macrodomain and PLP2 domain destabilize the proteins, as revealed by proteasome-dependent degradation. Lastly, we demonstrated that these mutant viruses promote type I IFN production from macrophages in tissue culture and are attenuated in mice. This study confirms and extends previous studies that independently identified the macrodomain and the papain-like protease 2 domain as modu- and 49). Studies of the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) revealed that the macrodomain at the N terminus of nsp3 hydrolyzes ADP-ribose groups from monoribosylated proteins and that this deribosylating activity is critical for CHIKV replication in vertebrate and insect cells and for virulence in mice (50) . Interestingly, viruses engineered to encode a mutation of the CHIKV macrodomain catalytic site rapidly reverted to the wild-type sequence (51) , similar to the high-frequency reversion we reported for the MHV MACmut virus (Fig. 3) . Studies of the role of the macrodomain during coronavirus replication indicate that catalytic activity is not required for virus replication in interferon-nonresponsive cell lines (19, 20, 24) . However, catalytic activity is important for replication in primary cells and in mice, implicating the macrodomain in evading the innate immune response and promoting viral pathogenesis (20, 24, 25) . Identifying the ribosylated substrates that are targeted by the viral enzymatic activity is an important future direction for this work.",

The removal of posttranslational modifications such as ADP-ribosylation and polyubiquitination could be directed at cellular proteins either to redirect them for use during viral replication or to subvert signaling of innate immune responses. Ultimately, structural and biochemical studies will be needed to fully investigate the multiple cis and trans interactions of nsp3 and to determine whether there is a dynamic interplay that modulates the stability, substrate specificity, and/or affinity of the enzymes and substrates.",

For nsp10, previous studies revealed that this protein plays critical roles in 3C-like-protease-mediated polyprotein processing and viral RNA synthesis (54, 55) . The results from these studies indicate that the mutations in nsp2 and nsp10 may also contribute to a ts phenotype.

Nucleotide sequences encoding the macrodomain (467 to 622 aa of nsp3) were amplified from a codon-optimized MHV nsp3 gene (sequence available upon request) and cloned into a pCAGGS vector with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, designated HA-MAC. The pCAGGS-PLP2 plasmid (PLP2-V5) was generated in a previous study (52) . The coding sequence of the macrodomain through the PLP2 domain (467 to 1,085 aa) was inserted into pcDNA3.1 and fused with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (pMP-WT). Mutations were introduced into these constructs using site-directed mutagenesis PCR or the Gibson Assembly technique to generate pMP-GD (G554D), pMP-2DN (D1026N/ D1071N), and pMP-GD/2DN (G554D/D1026N/D1071N), which all contain a C-terminal V5 tag.",
