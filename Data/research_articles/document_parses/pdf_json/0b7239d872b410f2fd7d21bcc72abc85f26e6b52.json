Two questions were added to the scale to determine COVID-19 impact on university student studies, social life, and family relations. The influence of COVID-19 on student substance use including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and prescription drugs was examined as well.

Present findings are consistent with those of prior studies and evidence that students who are religious tend to have a higher level of fear than those who are secular. This outcome is contrary to the belief that religiosity is a protective factor that helps a person overcome difficult life circumstances and promotes psychological well-being (Howell et al. 2019; Koenig 2015) . However, studies of religiosity in Russia and Belarus show it may be declarative in nature to a large extent and not accompanied by regular religious practice such as attending church on a regular basis and receiving communion (prayers, church visits, religious observance of restrictions, etc.) (Tikhomirov 2017; Zabaev et al. 2018) . Present study results, based on multiple psychological, mental health, and substance use factors evidence the impact of quarantine. Overall, university students from Belarus where there is less quarantine/self-isolation restrictions report more positive psycho-emotional conditions and less substance use than those from Russia. In addition, it is worth noting that the official Belarusian media are more cautious in covering the pandemic and tend to downplay its scope and consequences compared to Russia, where there is an overabundance of often controversial information about COVID-19 (Sorokin et al. 2020; Zogg 2020 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 275, "text": "(Brooks et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 276, "end": 296, "text": "Sorokin et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 643, "end": 663, "text": "(Howell et al. 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 664, "end": 676, "text": "Koenig 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 975, "end": 992, "text": "(Tikhomirov 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 993, "end": 1012, "text": "Zabaev et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1604, "end": 1625, "text": "(Sorokin et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1635, "text": "Zogg 2020", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The present study has limitations.
