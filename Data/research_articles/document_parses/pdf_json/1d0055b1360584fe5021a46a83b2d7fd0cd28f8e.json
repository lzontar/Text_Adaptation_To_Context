We could not detect any statistically significant difference between IgG >12 nasal swab positive and the COVID-19 populations, suggesting that the positivity to the swab does not correlate with a higher IgG plasma level (Fig. 5A) . Consistently, we could not detect statistically significant difference in IgG plasma levels in the IgG>12 AU/mL population divided by nasal swab negative and positive, even though the latter seemed slightly higher (Fig. 5A ). When we analyzed the plasma level of IgG in individuals coming from the different sites, we did not detect any statistically significant difference (Fig. 5B ). This indicates that while the proportion of individuals exposed to the virus was higher in the Bergamo area (Gavazzeni and Castelli), the magnitude of the response was similar (Suppl. Table 2 ). We observed a difference in the proportion of IgG positive individuals between males and females. This may indicate either a higher exposure to the virus, a higher incidence of infection or a higher ability to mount an immune response. Thus, we evaluated whether this difference was paralleled by increased IgG plasma levels, but there was no difference between IgG plasma levels of males versus females, suggesting a similar magnitude of the immune response ( Fig.   5C , Suppl. Table 2 ). However, when assessing a difference of IgG plasma levels across age ranges, males between 41 and 50 yo had significantly higher plasma levels of IgG than younger individuals (21-30 or 31-40) (Fig. 5D ). This, together with the finding that middle-aged men had also a higher frequency of IgG positive individuals, suggests that they seem to respond better in terms of antibody production (Fig. 5D ). This is in line with a recent report in COVID-19 patients showing that younger patients developed lower titers of IgG 10 . The difference of IgG response between females and males in relation to age remains quite intriguing and we still have to understand its relevance with the higher incidence of COVID-19 in males 9 .
