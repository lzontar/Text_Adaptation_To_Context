To examine the association between 41 the use and timing of IFN-\u03b12b and clinical outcomes, we analyzed in a retrospective multicenter 42 cohort study 446 COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. Regression models estimated that early 43 administration (\u22645 days after admission) of IFN-\u03b12b was associated with reduced in-hospital 44 mortality compared to no IFN-\u03b12b, while late administration of IFN-\u03b12b was associated with 45 increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-\u03b12b was not associated with hospital discharge 46 or CT scan improvement, while late IFN-\u03b12b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, 47 early IFN-\u03b12b and umifenovir (UFV) alone or together were associated with reduced mortality 48 and accelerated recovery compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone. We concluded that 49 administration of IFN-\u03b12b during the early stage of COVID-19 may induce favorable clinical 50 responses. 51 52",

Among patients admitted to Center 1, only 25% received IFN-\u03b12b, while 72.2% 122 received LPV/r. In contrast, among patients admitted to Center 2, 73% received IFN-\u03b12b and 123 36.3% received LPV/r. To assess the standard care at the two medical centers, we compared the 124 cumulative event curves for hospital discharge and CT improvement. Among all survivors, 125 patients admitted to Center 1 had longer hospitalization (Log-rank test, p < .001) ( Figure S1A ). 126 However, after excluding patients that received LPV/r, which tended to prolong hospitalization 127 due to various adverse effects, both centers showed comparable rate of hospital discharge cities. Together, we conclude that location of care was not associated with clinical outcomes in 135 this study. 136 Since the timing of IFN therapy may be crucial to its efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 137 infection, we calculated the time from admission to initiation of IFN therapy and found that 68.2% 138 IFN users received the first dose within the first 2 days of hospitalization and 89.3% received the 139 first dose within the first 5 days. Together with the fact that the first CT re-evaluation and 140 adjustment of treatment plans would also be carried out around the 5th day of hospitalization, we 141 empirically determined that initiation of IFN therapy within the first 5 days of hospitalization 142 was deemed early IFN therapy, and vice versa (Figure 2A) (4.9%) groups (Log-rank test, p < .001) ( Figure 2B ). Using logistic regression, we determined 173 that early IFN therapy was univariately associated with lower mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.18, p = .029), while late IFN therapy (OR = 3.53, p = .046), age >60 years (OR = 6.87, p < .001), 175 hypertension (OR = 6.87, p < .001), diabetes (OR = 8.96, p < .001), respiratory rate >22/min at 176 admission (OR = 10.1, p < .001), O 2 saturation between 90-93% (OR = 11.8, p < .001) or <93% 177 (OR = 25.2, p < .001) were univariately associated with higher mortality ( Figure S2 ).",

There are currently no proven 57 effective therapies for COVID-19 (Li and De Clercq, 2020; Sanders et al., 2020). Instead, a 58 number of anti-viral medications are repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients based on their in 59 vitro effectiveness against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that 60 causes COVID-19 and other coronavirus strains (Mantlo et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). 61 Interferons (IFN) have shown clinical efficacy in treating various viral infections and are 62 widely repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients (Hung et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 63 2020). Mechanistically, severe COVID-19 patients exhibit IFN insufficiency similar with those 64 seen in SARS-CoV infections, which could potentially be the immune evading mechanism of umifenovir (UFV). During the pandemic, each hospital has developed their own preferred drug 115 regime based on both clinical impression and drug availability. The preferred regime was given 116 to patients on a first-come first-serve basis before resorting to alternative drugs.

In fact, this drug combination has been used in China to treat COVID-19 256 patients after the disease first broke out in Wuhan in January 2020 (Zeng et al., 2020). However, 257 IFN was given much less focus than investigational antiviral agents such as Remdesivir and 258 hydroxychloroquine (Sanders et al., 2020), and substantial evidence of its clinical efficacy in 259 treating COVID-19 is still lacking. In this study, we took advantage of the drug stock disparity 260 during the peak of COVID-19 outbreak between two medical centers in Hubei, China and 261 conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing patients which underwent IFN-based therapies 262 with those which received no IFN. We found association of early IFN use with significantly 263 reduced in-hospital mortality. However, no significant clinical benefit of IFN was observed in 264 moderately ill COVID-19 patients, and late administration of IFN could be associated with 265 longer hospital stay and slower recovery of lung function. Additionally, we showed that using 266 early IFN with LPV/r is associated with favorable clinical responses than using LPV/r alone in 267 COVID-19 patients. 268 Our findings resonate with recent findings about the role of IFN in COVID-19 269 pathogenesis. 270 First, it is reported that the acute inflammation often seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients 271 is a result of repressed type I IFN expression and subsequent imbalanced IFN response with 272 excessive cytokine production, which could be corrected by administration of therapeutic IFN 273 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Indeed, animal studies has already shown that early IFN treatment protects mice from lethal SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection (Channappanavar et al., 2016; 275 Channappanavar et al., 2019). Together with our findings, it is plausible to speculate that early 276 administration of IFN in COVID-19 patients with high viral load or compromised immune 277 system would slow down the viral replication and disease progression (Nile et al., 2020).",

In this study, type \u2160 IFN was administered to the airway281 directly via an aerosol nebulizer, and thus should be highly potent to upregulate ACE2 282 expression in airway cells. In fact, our data showed no association of early IFN use with length 283 of hospital stay and time to CT improvement in survived patients, and late IFN use was 284 associated with slower CT improvement. These results point to the possibility that during the 285 peak of viral replication in moderately ill patients the beneficial and harmful effects of IFN may 286 cancel out each other. However, since critically ill patients often have a high viral load that may 287 already saturate airway cells (Zheng et al., 2020), IFN-induced ACE2 expression thus may no 288 longer pose significant risk as it does in moderately ill patients.",

Randomized controlled trials are still 292 needed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of IFN in treating COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, our293    findings presented in this study should provide interest and motivation to scientists and physicians in future research of IFN therapy, and hopefully lead to effective has several limitations. First, the retrospective design and the nonrandomized nature 298 of assignment of therapies limit the interpretation of our results. Second, there is potential for 299 survivorship bias due to the requirement of receiving IFN for at least 3 consecutive days in the 300 early IFN group, which is not required for no IFN group. However, examination of 16 records of 301 deceased patients found that the shortest duration from admission to in-hospital death was 5 days 302 with a median value of 17 days, which could accommodate a 3-day course of IFN or any other 303 therapies. In fact, all deceased patients received at least one anti-viral therapy, which was among 304 the entry criteria of this study. We also checked those records not included in this study and305 found no deceased patients among them. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that 306 some patients received therapies of interest may decease before confirmation of COVID-19 307 diagnosis and thus were excluded from the study. Third, detailed virologic data were not 308 included in the study which precluded comparison with randomized controlled trials of IFN 309 (Hung et al., 2020). Forth, our regression models did not include location of care as a confounder 310 because of multicollinearity with therapy choices between IFN and LPV/r. Although we did 311 investigate the potential variation of standard care and concluded no significant difference 312 between the two medical centers, selection bias and confirmation bias may still affect the 313 findings. Last, adjunctive and supportive therapies, such as corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, immunomodulatory agents and herbal medicine, were not included in the analyses but may 315 influence the length of hospital stay. 316 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 317 We thank Drs.

By this criterion, the combined 143 cohort from both medical centers was stratified to three groups: 216 (48.4%) received early IFN 144 therapy, 26 (5.8%) received late IFN therapy, and 204 (45.7%) received no IFN therapy. No patient received IFN-\u03b12b therapy prior to admission. Demographic characteristics were not significantly different between early, late and no IFN 147 groups except location of care and fewer female patients received early or late IFN (Table 1). Regarding clinical features at admission, the early and no IFN groups had comparable prevalence 149 of high respiratory rate and low O 2 saturation within 24 hours of admission, while late IFN group 150 had higher prevalence than both early and no IFN groups. More symptoms were reported in early IFN group with 19.9% that reported 3 or more symptoms at admission, comparing to 12.8% and 0% in no and late IFN groups, respectively. No IFN group had the lowest prevalence of lymphopenia and eosinopenia while late IFN group had the highest at admission. In general, patients in late IFN group exhibited higher disease severity at admission, while severity in early 155 and no IFN groups were comparable. For treatments, the median time from admission to first IFN dose was 2 and 8.5 days in early and late IFN groups, respectively. Median duration of IFN therapy was 10 and 8.5 days in early and late IFN groups, respectively. There were 60-90% prevalence of antibiotics use and Lianhua Qingwen capsules, an herb-based medication with 159 potential anti-viral efficacy, use among all groups. For overall evaluation of hospitalization, patients in late IFN group had significantly longer hospital stay, delayed CT improvement, and 161 longer disease course from symptom onset to hospital discharge. Late IFN group also had more 162 severe and critical patients retrospectively determined according to the Chinese CDC guideline, partly because they were more likely to initiate late IFN therapy after failing the first non-IFN 164 regime, while disease severity in early and no IFN groups was comparable. No IFN group had less prevalence (80.9%) of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids tests than other two groups (94.9% 166 and 92.3%) despite of 97.5% abnormal CT findings at admission. The prevalence of viral 167 shedding after showing CT improvement was comparable between all 3 groups.Primary OutcomeIn-hospital mortality was 3.6% among all patients and 14.4% among severe to critical patients (n 170 = 111). No death was recorded in mild or moderate patients. By comparing Kaplan-Meier curves, significant difference in mortality was observed across early (0.9%), late (15.4%), and no IFN",

The discharge criteria were defined as (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days, (2) significant improvement of respiratory symptoms and two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids tests of throat or nasal swab samples with at least 24 hours interval between the two tests. CT improvement was defined as the first CT scan showing significant improvement of the lungs compared with the previous scan, or the second consecutive CT scan at least 5 days after the first CT scan both showing marginal or incremental improvements in the lungs over previous scans. In severe and critical cases with disease relapse, CT improvement occurred before relapse was not counted. For patients re-admitted because of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids tests during follow-up, their timing of CT improvement during the first hospital stay would still be valid if they showed no symptom and were without radiological disease activity during the second hospital stay.An initial target sample size of 500 was determined based on the assumption of a 1:1 ratio of patients that received IFN or not, previously observed mortality rates(Guan et al., 2020)    and \u03b1 = .05. This sample size was calculated to have 90% power to detect a significant 435 hazard ratio of 0.5 if the mortality rate is 19%, a previously observed mortality estimates in the US.

Survival and cumulative event curves were compared by Log-rank test. Proportional hazard assumption was tested by examination of the Kaplan-Meier curve. Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression. Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models fitted for time from admission to death or last follow-up, time from admission to discharge, and time from admission to CT improvement, after adjusting for comorbidities. Analyses were performed using SPSS 26 (IBM) or Prism 8 (GraphPad). Missing data were excluded pairwise from analyses. Significance was evaluated at \u03b1 = .05 and all tests were 2-sided.
