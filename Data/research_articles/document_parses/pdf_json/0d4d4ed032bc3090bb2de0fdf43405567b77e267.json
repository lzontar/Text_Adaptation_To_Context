Eleven patients had COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples and one had two negative RT-PCR tests but positive findings on chest CT images. Eleven patients were hospitalized in the infectious diseases department and three of them were secondarily transferred to the ICU because of severe acute respiratory syndrome. One patient was directly hospitalized in the ICU. During their care, seven patients (58%) received oxygen therapy. One patient died during their hospital stay. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir was initiated in median (range) 4 days (1 to 9 days) after the first symptoms. Thirty plasma samples from the 12 patients were tested.

It would be important to evaluate the influence of tablets versus oral solution on lopinavir pharmacokinetics in COVID-19 ICU patients.",
