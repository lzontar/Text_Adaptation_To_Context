            "text": "Brazil currently has one of the fastest growing SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in the world. Due to limited available data, assessments of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on virus transmission and epidemic spread remain challenging. We investigate the impact of NPIs in 20 Brazil using epidemiological, mobility and genomic data. Mobility-driven transmission models for S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro cities show that the reproduction number (R t ) reached below 1 following NPIs but slowly increased to values between 1 to 1. 3 (1.0-1. 6 ). Genome sequencing of 427 new genomes and analysis of a geographically representative genomic dataset from 21 of the 27 Brazilian states identified >100 international introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. We 25 estimate that three clades introduced from Europe emerged between 22 and 27 February 2020, and were already well-established before the implementation of NPIs and travel bans. During this first phase of the epidemic establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, we find that the virus spread mostly locally and within-state borders. Despite sharp decreases in national air travel during this period, we detected a 25% increase in the average distance travelled by air passengers 30 during this time period. This coincided with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from large urban centers to the rest of the country. In conclusion, our results shed light on the role of large and highly connected populated centres in the rapid ignition and establishment of SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that current interventions remain insufficient to keep virus transmission under control in Brazil. 35",

As of 9 June 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused over 7 million cases and 404 thousand deaths globally (3) . SARS-CoV-2 was declared a public health emergency of 5 international concern on 30 January 2020. The virus can be classified into two phylogenetic lineages, named lineage A and B, that spread from Wuhan before strict travel restrictions were enacted (4, 5) and now co-circulate around the world (6) . The case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been estimated between 1.2 and 1.6% (7-9) with substantially higher ratios in those aged above 60 years (10) . Over 18 to 56% of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is from asymptomatic 10 or pre-symptomatic individuals (11) (12) (13) , complicating epidemiological assessments and public health efforts to curb the pandemic.",

Diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection were widely distributed across the national public health laboratory network from early on (16, 17) . However, several 20 factors including delays in reporting, changes in notification and heterogeneous access to testing across populations, have obfuscated real-time assessments of virus transmissibility based on SARS-CoV-2 case counts (15) . Given this, death counts caused by severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) reported to the Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade (SUS) provide a more accurate measure for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country (18) .

To investigate how SARS-CoV-2 became established across Brazil, and to quantify the impact of NPIs in virus spatiotemporal spread, we tested a total of 26,732 samples from public and private laboratories using real-time PCR assays and found 7,944 (29%) to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Sequenced samples were obtained from samples collected on average 5 days (median, range: 0 to 29 days) after onset of symptoms and were generated in 3 laboratories using harmonized sequencing and bioinformatic protocols. Despite the use of different diagnostic assays and sequencing primers across sites (Table S2) , our data suggests that higher genome coverage samples are characterized by lower real-time 25 PCR cycle threshold (Ct) and shorter times between symptom onset and sample collection (Fig.  S3) . When we include 63 additional available sequences from Brazil deposited in GISAID, a strong spatial representativity was obtained when considering the total number of genomes per state and SARI SARS-CoV-2 cases (n=490 sequences from 21 states, Spearman's correlation, \u03c1=0.83, P-value < 3.79 x 10 -7 , Fig. 2A ). This correlation ranged from 0.70 to 0.83 (P-values < 30 0.0001) when considering SARS-CoV-2 deaths or suspected cases, respectively (Fig. S4) . Moreover, we used an in-silico assessment of diagnostic assay specificity for Brazilian strains (n=490) to identify potential mismatches in some assays targeting Brazilian strains. We find that the forward primers of the Chinese CDC and Hong Kong University nucleoprotein-targeting RT-qPCR may be less appropriate for use in Brazil than other diagnostic assays for which few or no 35 mismatches were identified (Fig. S5, Table S3 ).",

With recent relaxation of NPIs in Brazil, continued surveillance is required to monitor trends in transmission and the emergence of new lineages in Brazil. Our analysis shows how changes in mobility may impact global and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and demonstrates how combining genomic and mobility data can 20 guide traditional surveillance approaches. sequences used in this study can be found in Data S1.

(C and D) Reproduction number Rt over time for the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo (C) and Rio de Janeiro (D). Reproduction numbers (R t ) were estimated using a Bayesian approach incorporating daily number of deaths and four 15 variables related to mobility data (a social isolation index from Brazilian geolocation company InLoco, and Google mobility indices for time spent in transit stations, parks, and the average between groceries and pharmacies, retail and recreational, and workspaces). Dashed horizontal line indicates Rt=1. Grey area and geometric symbols represent the time at which NPIs interventions were implemented. Bayesian credible intervals (BICs, 50 and 95%) are shown as 20 shaded areas.
