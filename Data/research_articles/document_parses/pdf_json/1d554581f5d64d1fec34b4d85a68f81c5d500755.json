Given its scale and accelerating expansion COVID-19 behooves a coordinated and simultaneous Whole-of-World approach that galvanizes clear global leadership and solidarity from all governments of the world. Considering an 'all hands-on deck' concept, we present a comprehensive list of tools and entities responsible for and enabling them, as well a conceptual framework to achieve the maximum impact. The list is drawn from pandemic mitigation tools developed in response to past outbreaks including influenza, coronaviruses, and Ebola and includes tools to minimize transmission in various settings including person-to-person, crowd, funerals, travel, workplace, and events and gatherings including business, social and religious venues. Included are the roles of individuals, communities, government and other sectors such as school system, health, institutions, and business. While individuals and communities have significant responsibilities to prevent person-to-person transmission, other entities can play a significant role to enable individuals and communities to make use of the tools. Historic and current data indicate the role of political will, whole-of-government approach, and the role of early introduction of mitigation measures.

Paramount for all healthcare systems must be keeping the health care staff COVID-19-free: without a robust healthcare force the crisis deepens and perpetuates. (23, 24) Classic disease control strategies such as early detection, case isolation, contact testing, health care infection control and clinical care remain a responsibility of the health care system. However, when the system is overwhelmed or when public health reach has been chronically under invested and lacking, in the pandemic setting, not only health care systems but governments may restrict services to providing care for the critically ill while delegating the isolation of contacts and less severe infections to the individuals, individual care providers, and communities. At times of large outbreaks, contact testing may not be sustainable, and testing may be confined to the confirmation of the severely ill, leading to exaggerated case fatality rates The business sector can enhance both service delivery (for example rapid test kit availability), innovation or production of countermeasures such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and novel delivery systems including drone and robotics assets in multiple countries. Elsewhere, online and drive-through delivery options may need massive upscaling directly contributing to mitigation while augmenting social distancing.

This may be due to variation in immunologic response in men and women and should be confirmed. The immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosome in female gender causes lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in man; the levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men; women generally produce higher levels of antibodies which remain in the circulation longer; and testosterone in males predisposes them to cardiovascular inflammation. 36 There is an urgent need to study the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines an important modulator of COVID-19, and drugs that bind to IL-1, IL-1R, IL-37, IL38 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). 37 Kawasaki's illness. 39 Along with home quarantine and other community mitigation measures, Conti P etal have called for better understanding of the role of oxygen therapy and the mode of action of O3 that has been proven to be beneficial to inhibit viral replication and improvement of lung function.

Previous Public Health Emergencies of International Concern have been geographically distinct, affording safe havens outside of the outbreak hotspot (2). For example, at the height of the recent 2018-19 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, life in the capital Kinshasa was near normal save occasional public health messages on billboards seen in the streets.

We have used the arbitrary term \"institutions\" to reflect a broad range of not-for profit and nongovernmental entities (academic, advocacy, funding, research) and may include health, economy, commerce, policy, politics, and technology sectors. Institutional contributions may include redirection of and supplementing pandemic mitigation efforts of the health system, academic institutions or governments. Such institutions can advance hybrid governmental and private sector responses. Universities can help seamless information flow, dedicated information sites, and support to corporate telehealth initiatives, and participate in research. The John Hopkins University COVID-19 Resource Center is an example. This week, the Task Force for Global Health convened a virtual meeting across 46 global entities representing pharmaceutical commodity donors, implementing partners and shippers, under WHO leadership to assess and respond to anticipated interruptions in critical supply chain of deworming drugs. This rapid consultation across multilaterals and private sector entities helped rapidly access existing platforms such as the DHL Control Tower for Humanitarian Supply Chain to assist the movement of medical supplies and other essential drugs from China to the rest of the world. sector is a critical determinant of modern societal functions worldwide and has huge stakes in making pandemic mitigation successful. For example, N-95 masks may be made in Cambodia by a U.S. owned corporation but sold in Canada or Chile.

The peace keeping missions of the United Nations (2) and the African Union are examples of international stewardship for security. Such options must be explored for mitigation efforts where needed. For example, if a country's defense or health sector is severely affected by absenteeism from illness or lacking resources to maintain mitigation measures or maintain law and order, multilateral peace keeping missions and staff may be deployed for assistance.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "measures in nations seeking to escape escalating pandemics should ideally begin before clinical cases are identified.

A patchwork of different timings of mitigation measures in multiple countries will only help SARS-CoV-2 maintain reservoirs awaiting reintroduction to nations that lift mitigation efforts prematurely. China and Hong Kong may be in the early stages of successive waves. It is premature to discern if all countries will have similar trajectory. As such, while extreme measures may be relaxed based on data, they should not minimize the importance of continuity of individual and community measures.If countries are financially and organizationally capable and have reached interval between pandemic waves, some of these skills and resources can be shared with more challenged countries, as has been done by China in Italy. There is a need to simplify international procedures for countries communicating and collaborating to repatriation of stranded citizens (consider the U.S. and U.K. citizens marooned in Peru), the sharing of relevant epidemic data, sharing of transparent outcome data in real-time including both successes and challenges with mitigation measures, and the leveraging of nation-specific capacities.(29)(30)(31)", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "an urgent need to assess the impact of COVID-19 on child health.

Such challenges can only be effectively addressed through a pan-global mindset. Though all countries may be affected by the time of the publication of this paper, some communities may not have detected their first case. We appeal to all communities to get ahead of the virus and take measures to keep the common enemy out. Nothaving huge caseload is no assurance of freedom from COVID-19. The only difference is that those that take early, broad and proactive measures will have the least burden and best prepared to weather the pandemic.
