Therefore, it's thought to reduce the ri sk of environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) based on the precautionary principles. However, long-time mask w earing could increase the flare of acne due to higher temperature and humidity on the surface of facial skin caused by expired air and the perspiration [1] [2] .
