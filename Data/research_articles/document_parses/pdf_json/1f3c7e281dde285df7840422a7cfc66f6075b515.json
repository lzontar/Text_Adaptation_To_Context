The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has the largest land area and population among the GCC members, where expatriates form 25.9 per cent of the total population (Center for Population Studies 2012). That is, one in every four persons in the Kingdom is an expatriate, indirectly influencing fertility decisions (Khraif 2009a, b; Courbage 1995) . The expert and technical labour force brought in to fulfil the increasing requirements of technological development and innovation affects the locally available native manpower in the fast changing Saudi Arabia, resulting in an imbalance on regional and urban scales, impacting upon economy, urban planning, transport, housing and employment and, in return, creating an over-urbanization (United Nations 2009 Khraif 2007 Khraif , 2001 Makki 1986 ). Still, from the role played by migrants in the economy, provisions of government services and social contracts, citizens benefit from their unregulated cheap employment at domestic level (Forstenlechner and Rutledge 2011) .",

The increasing administrative jobs and industrial job market influence the internal migration in the Kingdom, which has reasons other than employment, such as residential mobility-buying or building homes, increase in family size, affordability for better dwelling, rental rates, evacuation by the owner or inadequate services substantiate the migrants' relation with house ownership (Helderman et al. 2006) . However, majority of internal movements are from rural to urban in nature, accelerating the urbanization process, as stated by Clarke and Murray (1973) , with a successful spatial distribution policy that reduces widespread regional disparity in physical and social infrastructure and uneven settlements scattered at long distances (Al-Khalifeh 1993; Makki 1986) .

However, as compared with the other GCC countries-Bahrain, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-the effect of migration on population growth is found lesser in the Kingdom, despite the push to develop infrastructure-power stations, government ministries and industries (Khraif 2000) . Perhaps, the Saudization policies that changed labour and immigration laws since 2000 have influenced this trend. On the other hand, it is a fact that liberalization and globalization attract professional or skilled labour force from East Asia and Africa to Western countries. With the changing labour visa regulations, a decline in immigration in the Kingdom is expected in the future, which will create a population structure and distribution conducive for enabling an equitable treatment, policies and programmes. To achieve a positive relation between population dynamics and socioeconomic development, planning for migration at all levels should be associated with decentralization of decision-making in large urban centres and distribution of economic investment over a wide area, where urban population spreads out in medium and small centres (Makki 1986 ). According to the US Census data, net migrants in the Kingdom kept on decreasing annually since 1993, reaching the lowest level in 1999. Thereafter, with slight changes, their numbers declined and reached a negative level by 2006, and the same trend continues at present. That is, the immigrants have started returning to their native countries more often (Fig. 5.3 ). In contrast, the national censuses show a continuously increasing immigrant population in the Kingdom but with lower growth rates, during 2004-2010, as compared to 1992-2004 . In short, the migration data (net migrants) as given by the US Census Bureau do not tally with the national datasets. A similar trend is visibly noted in all the other GCC states but at different periods. Oman started experiencing negative net migration since 2003. Similarly, Qatar has the highest rate of net migration, followed by Bahrain. Definitely, these countries will soon follow the trends of Saudi Arabia, as the labour laws of Saudi Arabia are usually adopted by the other GCC states. These data also require comparisons with the national censuses for understanding the trend of immigration.",

The number of persons per household, an indicator of population density at household level, shows differences between the natives and immigrants. While native households have more than six persons on an average, immigrants have just four, which could explain the immigrants' status (as forced bachelorship), expanded male adults and age-sex distribution.

More than 90 per cent of Saudi households in Northern Borders, Al-Riyadh, Al-Jouf and Eastern House ownership is generally restricted to the natives, as per the Kingdom's housing policies; however, there are few immigrants who own their housing as per special sanctions granted by the Kingdom. But the rental housing system is more focussed on the immigrants; still, there are natives who also live in rented housings, which may be due to migrations or for the flexibility of labour force. One-third of the immigrants reside in rented houses, while the rest reside in official houses. Rental houses remain less than 50 per cent in Al-Qaseem and Al-Baha, implying that official houses are higher in proportions. But the proportions of natives living in rental houses are very low in these areas, as compared to immigrants.",

There exits tremendous and varying degrees of pull and push factors determined by socioeconomic development, industrialization and urbanization. The major in-migrating areas are Tabouk, Al-Riyadh and Eastern region, while the major outmigrating destinations are Al-Baha, Jazan, Hail, Al-Qaseem, Aseer and Northern Borders. A few areas remain more or less stable without pulling or pushing native population. Public sector employment and proximity to metropolis (Riyadh, Jeddah/Makkah or Dammam) are major pull factors. Makkah Al-Mokarramah maintains the status without being influenced significantly by the migration flows. Again, as seen elsewhere, males migrate more than females, as observed in the absolute numbers of inmigrants and out-migrants as well as net migrants. The regional development-infrastructure development and promoting medium-sized cities-with an aim to create employment encourages native population to continue living at their own birth places. Those areas experiencing substantial levels of immigration require redistribution policies, both for population and infrastructure development programmes. The spatial mobility may be regulated by encouraging local-level human resource development and regional development efforts underway in the Kingdom such as the creation of industrial, educational and medical townships at various geographic destinations. Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the GCC in terms of both land area and population, thus having the highest level of international migration within the Arab world and beyond. The changing labour laws and Saudization efforts shall curb this situation, bringing a balance between the demand and supply in the labour market. The hiked net migration rate (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) has immediately been brought to unity, which will reduce at prevailing emigration trend.",
