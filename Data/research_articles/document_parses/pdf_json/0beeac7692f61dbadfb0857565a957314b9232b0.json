However, there were conflicting findings reported in several studies as Meng J. et al, Liu Y. et al and Feng Y. reported that patients on ACE inhibitors/ARB had lower rates of severe outcomes whereas Richardson S. et al reported higher rates of invasive ventilation and ICU admissions in patients on ACE inhibitors/ARB as compared to non-users and Guo J. et al found that patients on ACE inhibitors/ARB had higher rates of cardiovascular disease and elevated troponin T (TnT) levels. It is pertinent to note that all above studies did not perform adjustment for covariates or matching for analysis, undermining the statistical strength of their results to a certain extent [12, 14, 15, 17, 18] . However, Zhang P. et al did perform matching and an adjusted analysis of 348 patients in which he found slightly higher rates of ICU admissions in patients on ACE inhibitors (21.4%) and ARB (20.8%) as compared to non-users (14.8%) [16] . Zhang P. et al again performed matching and adjustment in assessing the mortality outcomes strengthening their conclusions regarding safety of ACEI/ARB, however a large sample size study conducted in New York in over 1000 COVID-19 patients by Richardson S. et al raised concerns of worse mortality outcomes with ACEI/ ARB and cannot be overlooked [15, 16] .",

Meng J. et al and Li J. et al reported lower rates of mortality in ACEI/ARB users versus nonusers in an unadjusted analysis. Zhang P. et al performed matching and an adjusted analysis of 348 patients in which he found that the rate of mortality was statistically significantly lower in patients on ACEI/ARB as compared to non-users [Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.37, p value = 0.03]. Similarly, Bean D.M. et al found lower rates of their primary endpoint of death or critical care transfer in patients on ACE inhibitors as compared to non-users (13.5% vs 27.7%) [12,13,15,19]. (",
