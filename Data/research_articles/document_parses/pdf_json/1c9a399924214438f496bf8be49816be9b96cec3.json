For Canada, our estimates of the expansion factor lie in this range of 10 to 500 (Table 4) .

In both cases, investigations of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Canada and Mexico align well with Canada; however, according to our analysis the underestimation in laboratory-confirmed surveillance in the US is more substantial.

Another limitation to this study is the assumed homogeneous mixing between age groups; however, this may also be addressed in a future study.
