Here, we demonstrate that strains harboring the mof4-1 allele inactivated the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. The MOF4 gene was shown to be allelic to UPFJ, a gene whose product is involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Although cells harboring the mof4-1 allele of the UPF1 gene lose the M1 virus, mutations in other UPF genes involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay maintain the M1 virus. The mof4-1 strain is more sensitive to the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin than a upflA strain, and frameshifting efficiency increases in a mof4-1 strain grown in the presence of this drug. Further, the ifsl and ifs2 alleles previously identified as mutations that enhance frameshifting were shown to be allelic to the UPF2 and UPF1 genes, respectively, and both ifs strains maintained Ml. These results indicate that mof4-1 is a unique allele of the UPF1 gene and that the gene product of the mof4-1 allele affects both -1 ribosomal frameshifting and mRNA turnover.",

However, in the last 10 years, a number of cases of directed ribosomal frameshifting have been reported in viruses, including retroviruses, coronaviruses, the L-A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus and the Ty family of viruses in yeast, the dsRNA virus of Giardia lamblia, (+) single-stranded RNA viruses of plants and the bacteriophage T7. In addition, programed frameshifting has been utilized by a number of bacterial transposons, as well as in a few bacterial cellular genes and the omithine decarboxylase antizyme gene in mammals (for reviews, see Chandler and Fayet, 1993; Dinman, 1995; Farabaugh, 1995; Hayashi and Murakami, 1995) .",

            "text": "The dsRNA L-A virus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two ORFs. The 5' gag gene encodes the Gag protein and the 3' pol gene encodes a multifunctional protein domain required for viral RNA packaging and replication. A -1 ribosomal frameshift event is responsible for the production of the Gag-pol fusion protein. M1, a satellite dsRNA virus of L-A which encodes a secreted killer toxin, is encapsidated and replicated using the gene products synthesized by the L-A virus (reviewed in Dinman, 1995) . The combination of L-A and M1 constitute the yeast 'killer' virus system. The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting determines the relative ratios of Gag to Gag-pol fusion protein available for viral particle morphogenesis, and changes in ribosomal frameshift efficiencies have major effects on the ability of cells to propagate viruses which use ribosomal frameshifting (reviewed in Dinman, 1995) . Screens for mutations that increased the programed -1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies in yeast cells identified chromosomal mutations that are called mof (for maintenance of frame; Dinman and Wickner, 1992, 1994; Dinman, 1995) and ifs (increased ftameshifting; Lee et al., 1995) . The screen originally used to identify the mof mutants utilized a construct in which the lacZ gene was inserted downstream of the L-A -1 ribosomal frameshift signal and in the -1 reading frame relative to a translational start site. Similarly, the ifs mutations were identified using a reporter construct in which the CUP] gene was used as a reporter and inserted downstream of a -1 ribosomal frameshift signal from the mouse mammary tumor virus and in the -1 reading frame relative to a translational start site (Lee et al., 1995) . The assays for mofand ifs mutants relied upon identifying cells with higher ,B-galactosidase activities or cells demonstrating increased resistance to media containing copper. The inference was that the efficiency of -1 ribosomal frameshifting was increased in these mutants.",

Since ribosomal frameshifting is inefficient (i.e. 2to 8-fold increase) in these mutants, it is conceivable that the translation apparatus may 'see' these reporter transcripts as nonsensecontaining mRNAs. Transcripts containing premature translation termination codons are degraded rapidly in a cell, in a process that is referred to as nonsense-mediated 76 Oxford University Press mof4-1 in mRNA turnover and ribosomal frameshifting mRNA decay (reviewed in Peltz et al., 1994; Maquat, 1995; Weng et al., 1996a) . Reduced mRNA levels or decreased stability of nonsense-containing transcripts have been observed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (reviewed in Peltz et al., 1994; Maquat, 1995; Jacobson and Peltz, 1996) . Chromosomal mutations that stabilize nonsense-containing mRNAs by inactivating the nonsensemediated mRNA decay pathway have been identified and characterized in the yeast S.cerevisiae. Mutations in the UPF, UPF2 and UPF3 genes elevate the concentration of nonsense-containing mRNAs in cells by increasing their half-lives without affecting the decay rates of most wild-type transcripts (Leeds et al., 1991 (Leeds et al., , 1992 Peltz et al., 1993; Cui et al., 1995; Hagan et al., 1995; He and Jacobson, 1995) . Seen in this light, the increased P3galactosidase activity or copper resistance observed in mof or ifs strains may result from mutations that increase the intracellular concentrations of these nonsensecontaining reporter transcripts.",

The inefficiently spliced CYH2 precursor, which contains an intron near the 5' end, is a naturally occurring substrate for nonsensemediated mRNA decay and has been demonstrated to be a reliable indicator of the activity of this decay pathway (He et al., 1993; Cui et al., 1995; Hagan et al., 1995) . The status of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay activity in cells can be determined easily by comparing the ratio of the abundance of the CYH2 precursor to the CYH2 mRNA on an RNA blot. Wild-type, upflA and mof4-1 strains were grown to mid-log phase, RNAs were isolated, and the abundance of transcripts was determined by Northern blotting. The abundance of the CYH2 precursor was low in wild-type cells but increased at least 5-fold in a upflA strain ( Figure IA ). In the mof4-1 mutants, the abundance of CYH2 precursor was elevated to a level similar to that observed in a upf]A strain ( Figure IA ). The abundance of the nonsense-containing mini-PGKI transcript, which is extremely sensitive to the UPF] status of the cell , was also monitored and its abundance was increased 10-fold in both tnof4-1 and upf]A strains as compared with wild-type cells ( Figure  1B ). The abundance of the CYH2 mRNA and wild-type PGK1 mRNA was equivalent in all strains ( Figure 1B) , indicating that they are probably degraded by a different mRNA decay pathway (Peltz et al., 1994) .",

In addition, the complete UPFJ gene from a mof4-1 strain was also synthesized by PCR (Materials and methods). These plasmids were transformed into a upflA strain (Y52-, Table II ) and the CYH2 precursor abundance was determined in these strains ( Figure 2B ). The CYH2 precursor was abundant in cells containing a hybrid in which the 5' segment of the wild-type UPFJ gene was replaced with the 5' fragment from the mof4-1 allele (Figure 2, pmof4AEI_2), or in cells containing plasmid pmof4BEI12, which encodes the complete mof4-1 allele of the UPFJ gene. The abundance of CYH2 precursor was low in cells harboring plasmid pmof4ABI_2, which contains the hybrid UPFI gene in which the 3 ' two-thirds of the gene was replaced with the DNA fragment from the mof4-1 allele (Figure 2, pmof4ABI_2) . These results indicate that the mutation in the mof4-J allele is located within the 5' one-third of the UPFI gene. The DNA sequence of the 5' region of the mof4-1 allele (nt -83 to 1469) was determined from plasmids pmof4AE1 and pmof4BE, (Figure 2A ). Comparison of this sequence with wild-type UPFJ revealed a single G->A mutation at nucleotide 586 in the cysteine/histidine-rich region, changing a cysteine codon at codon 62 to a tyrosine. The mof4-1 clones from both plasmids pmof4AE2 and pmof4BE2 also contained the same G-4A mutation (data not shown). To confirm that the identified Cys-Tyr mutation resulted in the Mof4 phenotype, a 900 bp BstXI-Asp718 DNA fragment from the wild-type UPFJ gene was replaced with an analogous DNA fragment from either plasmid pmof4AE1 or pmof4BEj harboring the mof4-1 mutation ( Figure 2B , pmof4XAE and pmof4XBE). Cells harboring the above hybrid UPFJ gene had the same three phenotypes as the mof4-1 strain, including: (i) elevated abundance of CYH2 precursor and frameshift reporter LacZ mRNA (Figures 2B and IC); (ii) inability to propagate the M1 killer virus (Table IV, Table IV , #5).

A upflA strain (YGC106) containing the lacZ frameshift reporter construct in the zero or -1 frame relative to the translation start site (p315-JD86-ter or p315-JD85-ter) was transformed with a single copy plasmid harboring either the wild-type UPFJ gene, the mof4-1 allele or the vector alone. The ,3-galactosidase activities in these strains were monitored, and the percentage of -1 frameshifting was calculated. Cells containing the mof4-1 allele had a -1 ribosomal frameshifting efficiency of 6.4%. UPFJ and upflA cells had an efficiency of 1.4 and 3.1%, respectively. Interestingly, the~2-fold increase in -1 ribosomal frameshifting observed in upflA cells is very similar to that reported for the ifs2-1 mutants (Lee et al., 1995) . The 2-fold increase in programed frameshifting efficiency in these strains corresponds to the 2to 3-fold stabilization of the frameshift reporter transcript ( Figure IC) . The elevated level of -1 frameshifting in mof4-1 cells, however, was not due solely to the stabilization of the LacZ frameshift reporter mRNA, since the abundance of the LacZ frameshift reporter mRNA was equivalent in both mof4-1 and upflA cells ( Figure IC) . Thus, the higher expression level of the lacZ gene product in the -1 reading frame in mof4-1 cells as compared Hybrid genes between the wild-type UPFI and the mof4-1 alleles schematically represented in (A) were constructed, transformed into a upflA strain (Y52-) and CYH2 precursor abundance was determined by RNA blotting analysis as described in Figure 1 . An autoradiogram of this analysis is shown in (B). The black rectangle in (A) represents sequences from the wild-type UPFJ gene while the hatched rectangle represents sequences from the mof4-1 allele. The cysteine/histidine-rich region of the UPFI gene is represented by a gray rectangle in the wild-type UPFJ gene. The dark vertical line represents the location of the mutation within the mof4-1 allele. The mof4-1 allele was sequenced and the sequence change is shown. For each hybrid allele shown in (A) two identical constructs were prepared from different PCRs and are designated with the subscript 1 or 2 in (B) (see Materials and methods).

The contribution of frameshift suppression independent of the programed -1 frameshifting signal in a mof4-1 strain was also examined. The ratio of ,-galactosidase activities where the lacZ gene is in the -1 frame but lacks the ribosomal -1 frameshift signal (pTI24; Dinman et al., 1991) was determined with regard to pTI25, the zero frame control. We found that a mof4-1 strain was able to enhance frameshift suppression from the lacZ fusion transcript synthesized from pTI24 from 0.01 to 0.22%, a 22-fold increase in ,-galactosidase activity compared with wild-type cells. Although this represents a significant increase in frameshift suppression, it is far below the 8% efficiency of programed ribosomal -1 frameshifting observed in mof4-1 cells. A 600-fold increase in frameshift suppression in mof4-1 cells would have had to be observed to account for the increase in f-galactosidase activity generated from the lacZ reporter construct containing the programed -1 frameshift signal. Therefore, frameshift suppression at the termination codon does not account for the apparent increase in the efficiency of programed -1 ribosomal frameshifting in mof4-1 cells.",

Cells harboring the mof4-1 allele lose the ability to propagate the Ml dsRNA virus Therefore, we next examined whether mutations that inactivate the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway affect the maintenance of the M1 dsRNA virus. L-A and Ml were introduced by cytoduction into strains harboring the mof4-1, upflA, upfl-2, upf2-1, upJ2A, ifsl-l or ifs2-1 alleles, and these cells were replica plated onto a lawn of cells that are sensitive to the killer toxin. Cells maintaining the Ml virus secrete the killer toxin, creating a ring of growth inhibition (Dinman and Wickner, 1992) . The results from these experiments are shown in Figure 3A and summarized in Table III . Only cells harboring the mof4-1 allele were unable to maintain the killer phenotype ( Figure  3A ; Table III ).

Paromomycin sensitivity was monitored in isogenic strains (mof4-1 + pYCp33-UPF1, mof4-1 + vector and mof4A::ura3 + vector; Figure  4A ) by placing discs containing 1 mg of paromomycin onto the plate. By comparing the zone of growth inhibition around the disc containing the drug, the antibiotic sensitivity of these strains can be assessed. The results demonstrate that strains harboring the mof4-1 allele were more sensitive to paromomycin than cells harboring either the wild-type UPFJ gene or a mof4A1upflA allele ( Figure 4A , compare #1 with #2 and #4). Unlike the mof4-1 strain, the isogenic mof4A/upflA strain (mof4A::ura3 + vector) was no more sensitive to paromomycin than the wildtype UPFI+ strain, consistent with the results reported previously ( Figure 4A , compare #2 with #4; Leeds et al., 1992; Cui et al., 1995) .

Cells were grown in liquid media in the presence of different concentrations of the drug and the f3-galactosidase activities were determined, normalized to the number of cells used in the assay. The ,3-galactosidase activities from pJD 107 (harboring the -1 frameshift reporter gene) in the mof4-1 strain (mof4-1 + vector) climbed steadily with increasing concentrations of paromomycin, while there was no change in 3-galactosidase activity in mof4-1 cells containing pYCp22UPF1 or in mof4A::ura3 cells (Table V) . The 0-galactosidase activities from pJD108 (the zero frame control) were unaffected by the addition of paromomycin in all three strains (Table V; Figure 4B ). Taken together, these results suggest that paromomycin can affect the efficiency of-1 ribosomal frameshifting in a mof4-1 strain, and that paromomycin exacerbates the defect of the mof4-1 allele of the UPFJ gene. We further wanted to determine whether substrates for the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway increased in cells that were treated with paromomycin. The mRNA abundance of the CYH2 precursor was determined in UPFJ+/MOF4+, mof4-1 and upflA/mof4A strains grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of paromomycin. Cell aliquots were collected, RNAs were isolated and the CYH2 mRNA and precursor abundances were determined by RNA blotting analysis as described above. The results demonstrate that the ratio of the CYH2 precursor to mRNA was not altered by the presence of paromomycin in any strains tested ( Figure 4B ). This result indicates that paromomycin treatment does not affect the nonsensemediated mRNA decay pathway. Discussion mof4-1 was identified originally as a recessive mutation that increased the efficiency of programed -1 ribosomal frameshifting at the L-A frameshift site (Dinman and Wickner, 1994) . Here we show that MOF4 is allelic to the UPFJ gene and mof4-1 mutation increases the abundance of the nonsense-containing mRNAs, suggesting that this mutation completely abrogates the activity of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (Figure 1 ). aStrain JD474-5A, harboring either pYCp22UPFl or vector, and strain Y109 were transformed with either the high copy plasmid pJD107 (-1 ribosomal frameshift tester) or pJD108 (zero frame control). Paromomycin was added to cells inoculated at 0.1 OD595/ml and grown in -Trp -Leu liquid media at 30\u00b0C for 4 h. The f-galactosidase activities were determined by subtracting the f-galactosidase activity of cells lacking these plasmids (harboring a single copy integrated -1 frameshift reporter construct) from P-galactosidase activity observed in cells harboring the reporter constructs on 2g plasmids (pJD107, pJD108) and the percentage of -1 ribosomal frameshifting was calculated by: (pJD07/pJDL08)X 100%.",

Both the mof4-1 and upflA alleles stabilized nonsense-containing RNAs (CYH2 precursor, mini-PGK1 mRNA; Figure IA and B) as well as the frameshift LacZ reporter mRNA to the same level ( Figure IC ), yet mof4-1 cells had 2-fold more -1 ribosomal frameshifting efficiency than upflA or ifs2-1 cells.

However, these alleles do not affect the maintenance of the Ml dsRNA virus (Table III) . The ability to propagate the Ml dsRNA killer virus serves as a second independent assay to distinguish between mutations that affect ribosomal frameshifting efficiencies from those mutations that only affect mRNA turnover. Clearly, without such a secondary assay, use of only frameshift reporter constructs, which monitor only the level of the end-product expressed, will often identify mutations that apparently affect the level of frameshifting without actually altering this process. The isolation of ifs mutants is an example of this problem. ifs]-l and ifs2-1 are alleles of UPF2 and UPF], respectively (see above; Lee et al., 1995) , which increased the apparent frameshifting efficiency 2-fold, similar to that observed in a upflA strain. However, strains harboring these mutations did not promote loss of the Ml virus (Table III) . By using both the frameshift reporter system and monitoring the ability to propagate the Ml virus as measures of alterations in frameshifting, the ifs mutants do not alter the efficiency of programed -1 frameshifting to promote loss of the Ml virus. Similarly, the previously reported mof3-1, mop7-l and mof8-1 lesions, which increase -1 frameshifting as monitored by the lacZ frameshift reporter but do not lose the Ml virus (Dinman and Wickner, 1994) , also cannot be classified strictly as mutations that effectively alter -1 ribosomal frameshifting efficiencies. At present, it is difficult to determine whether the increased ,-galactosidase activities observed in these strains are consequences of stabilizing the frameshift reporter mRNA or changes in programed -1 frameshifting. Currently, we are developing new frameshift reporter constructs that will be insensitive to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway and, thus, these should allow us to separate the effects of mRNA stabilization from alterations in frameshifting efficiencies. The observation that the efficiency of -1 ribosomal frameshifting in mof4-1 cells was elevated in response to increasing doses of paromomycin is an important result since it demonstrates that a drug can modulate programed -1 frameshifting efficiencies. This supports the notion that ribosomal frameshifting may serve as a potential target for antiviral compounds, altering the Gag to Gag-pol ratio. It is anticipated that the identification and characterization of gene products involved in this process and of drugs that modulate it will lead to therapeutics to combat viral diseases.",

The deduced amino acid sequence of the UPFI gene indicates that it encodes a 109 kDa protein with zinc finger motifs near its N-terminus and harbors the appropriate motifs for it to be classified as a member of the ATP binding RNA-DNA helicase superfamily group I (Altamura et al., 1992; Koonin, 1992) . Purification of the Upflp demonstrated that it is an RNA binding protein with ATPase and helicase activities (Czaplinski et al., 1995) . A UPF] gene disruption results in stabilization of nonsense-containing mRNAs and also yields a nonsense suppression phenotype (Leeds et al., 1991; Cui et al., 1995) . A single Cys->Tyr change at codon 62 in the N-terminal cysteine/histidine-rich region of the UPF] gene accounts for the mof4-1 allele of the UPF] gene and Mof4 phenotypes (Figure 4) . Interestingly, other mutations in the cysteine/histidine-rich region of the UPFJ gene have been identified that were able efficiently to degrade nonsense-containing transcripts but inactivated its translation termination activity at a nonsense codon, thus allowing for suppression of nonsense alleles (Weng et al., 1996b) . These results indicate, but do not prove, that the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay properties of the Upf1 protein can be separated from its function in modulating translation termination at a nonsense codon. Furthermore, the results suggest that the cysteine/histidinerich region may be required for modulating certain aspects of translation termination at nonsense codons. The mof4-1 allele is unique because this lesion inactivates both the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay activity and alters programed translational frameshifting. Taken together, these results pose a very interesting question concerning how the processes of translation termination at a nonsense codon, programed -1 frameshifting and mRNA decay are related. Future work will be required to determine whether these are directly or indirectly related processes.",

In pJD107, the 4.9 kb HindIII fragment from pF8 was ligated into HindlIldigested pRS426 (Christianson et al., 1992) and contains the PGK1 promoter, a translational start site, followed by a 218 bp cDNA fragment of L-A containing the -1 ribosomal frameshift signal. This is followed by the lacZ gene, which is in the -1 frame with respect to the start site. pJD108 contains the 4.7 kb Hindlll fragment of pT125 cloned into the HindIll site of pRS426, and the lacZ gene is in the zero frame without any intervening sequence. p31l5-JD85-ter, p315-JD86-ter, p314-JD85-ter and p314-JD86-ter were constructed and used for the measurement of LacZ mRNA abundance. HindIIl fragments from pJD85 (lacZ in -1 frame, Dinman and Wickner, 1994) and pJD86 (lacZ in zero frame: Dinman and Wickner, 1994) were ligated into pRS315 or pRS314, and a 300 bp BglII-HindIII fragment containing the PGKI transcription termination signal was inserted downstream of the lacZ gene. The constructions of pYCp33UPFl, pYCp22UPFl and pYCp33UPF2 were as described before (Cui et al., 1995) . The plasmids pmof4AE, pmof4AB and pmof4BE, used to clone the mof4-1 allele, were constructed as follows: the 1.47 kb Asp718-EcoRI fragment or the 2.6 kb Asp718-BamHI fragment from pYCp33UPFI, containing the UPFI gene, was deleted and replaced with the corresponding fragments of the inof4-1 allele that were isolated by PCR (see below). pmof4BE was cloned by inserting the 4.2 kb EcoRI-BamHI PCR DNA fragment from the mof4-1 strain into pYCplac33. Since the pYCp33UPF1 contains more than one BstXI site, pmof4XAE and pmof4XBE were constructed by two steps. A 978 bp BstXI-Asp718 DNA fragment from pPUC-UPFl (Cui et a!. 1995) was replaced with a BstXI-Asp7l8 DNA fragment from pmof4AE and pmof4BE, forming pPUCmof4XAE and pPUCmof4XBE respect-ively. The 4.2 kb BamHI-EcoRI fragments from these two plasmids were cloned into pYCplac33 vector.",
