            "text": "In the last decades, humanity has experienced control and eradication of several diseases due to the development of vaccines (Hotez et al. 2020) . Some generations have never experienced an epidemic situation of some diseases such as measles and polio (Greenlee and Newton 2018) . Recently, nevertheless, the world has been through the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, and the absence of an effective vaccination against such virus has caused so far devastating impact on public health, with millions of casualties (Luan et al. 2020; Velavan and Meyer 2020) , reinforcing the importance of vaccines. Unfortunately, vaccination coverage has been decreasing worldwide and this reduction could be a potential risk of reemergence of vaccine-preventable disease (VPDs), jeopardizing the overall population health (Siani 2019) . The Brazilian National Immunization Program (Programa Nacional de Imuniza\u00e7\u00f5es, PNI) and the Unified Health System (Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade, SUS) have been providing free vaccines for several diseases to people from all age groups, reaching a national coverage higher than 90% (Sato 2018) . Notwithstanding, the government efforts with the vaccination campaigns, Brazil's vaccination coverage has been dropping since 2013 and an increased level of vaccine refusal has been detected in the country (Brown et al. 2018 ). These phenomena have been strongly associated with the \"scientific proofed disadvantages of vaccines\" rapidly spread through social media. This misinformation campaign leads the population hesitancy to be vaccinated and has become a big challenge for the PNI in recent years . Despite the regular challenges to vaccinate the population, all these new issues have a harmful impact on the coverage with a potential increase in the number of preventable deaths (Sato 2018) . The comprehension of the dynamics of the vaccination coverage in Brazil can be accessed using the PNI's vaccination data. This approach helps to identify the behavior of the population and potential risks for reintroduction of VPDs in the country.",

In the analysis of the whole country, a seasonal pattern was observed starting in 2004; such pattern was lost in 2011 ( Figure 4B ). In order to confirm the seasonal pattern, a lag plot analysis was performed. The lag plots showed an absence of autocorrelation within the timeseries, suggesting a random structure across the data by the months ( Figure 4C ). To predict the vaccination coverage pattern for the next 5 years, the exponential smoothing state space model was employed using ARIMA (see Methods for details). The prediction model revealed a maintenance of random pattern in vaccination coverage for the next 5 years ( Figure 4D ).",

            "text": "The same approach was performed in each Brazilian region and revealed that the change from seasonal to random as well as the prediction for the next 5 years were reproduced in all regions (Supplementary Figure 1) . This observation is of extreme concern, because of this age group's increased susceptibility to new infections due to less mature immune system. Furthermore, successfully controlled VPDs would be ready to return, potentially causing new epidemics, raising challenges for new physicians without experience with these diseases (Greenlee and Newton 2018) . Since 2016, the vaccination coverage has been dropping in children under 10 years about 10% to 20% in Brazil (Hussain et al. 2018 ). This reduction was associated with reduction in funding dedicated to the SUS, aside from the increasing people's distrust in vaccines and vaccination hesitancy (Sato 2018) . However, in the present study, we observed a peak of overall immunization in 2017, due to yellow fever vaccine shots especially in the southeastern region, which was the epicenter of a yellow fever outbreak in that year (Goldani 2017 ). This peak was followed by a continuous decrease in the absolute number of vaccinations in the following two years. The ARIMA time-series model was used here to predict the vaccination coverage profile for the next 5 years in the whole country and in each region. This model has been used to predict mortality incidence of pneumonia and influenza (Choi and Thacker 1981) , infectious diseases (Allard 1998) pointed out as challenges for the Brazilian national immunization program (Hotez et al. 2020) . A study conducted in S\u00e3o Paulo has highlighted the psychological element as an important factor in delaying vaccination schedules due to parents' anxiety, pitying their children from getting vaccine shots (Silveira et al. 2020) . Such aspects combined with antivaccination groups activism in social media and distrust in medical science expose the complexity of contending the reduction of vaccination coverage (Smith 2017; Silveira et al. 2020 ). Therefore, a multifaceted strategy is necessary to avert recurrence of VPDs and to eradicate once again such diseases. Although our findings led us to speculate that there is a relation between anti-vaccination movement and immunization coverage in Brazil, additional prospective investigations systematically collecting primary data on both anti-vaccination movement and vaccination hesitancy are still warranted to directly test hypotheses.",

They pay more attention to vaccine minor side effects such as mild fever, muscle, and joint aches, headache and pain where the shot was given (Nour 2019 ). This behavior is reinforced by anti-vaccination propaganda, spread in social media, which highlights those side effects together with unproven \"facts\" (e.g. MMR vaccine associated with autism (Kolff et al. 2018) ) over the individual and community benefits of vaccines. Therefore, to counteract this bad propaganda against vaccines, the physicians, scientific community and health agencies should be more active in the internet and social media remembering how dangerous these VPDs are and guiding people to maintain better health behaviors (Smith 2017) . A social-ecological model can suggest where vaccination campaigns should go to promote increased coverage taking into account strategies in individual, interpersonal, organizational, community and society levels (Kolff et al. 2018) . Not only social media should be aimed at, but blogs and apps delivering surveillance data and health education material may also contribute to stimulating healthy behaviors. It is important to note that to battle such a complex health problem, all strategies should be performed together and for a long-term solution it is essential to educate future generations about scientific methodology and evidence-based medicine and health, leading them to critically evaluate the veracity of the information they get from social media (Hopf et al. 2019) .",

Thus, it is extremely important for physicians, the scientific community and health agencies to take countermeasures and avoid the recurrence of once eradicated VPDs. The reduction in the last 3 years and the random pattern of vaccination coverage detected and predicted by the analyses presented here are an alert to Brazilian authorities and strategies must be developed to improve the vaccine coverage and reduce the vaccine hesitancy, primarily in the pediatric vaccines.",

On the converse, 2014, 2001 and 2017 exhibited the highest number of vaccinations, with125,357,642, 123,428,150 and   118,590,603 immunizations, respectively. This peak in 2017 was followed by a decrease in the next two years, resulting in 102,469.969 vaccinations in 2019 (a reduction of 13.6%).The smooth line in vaccination data depicts a fluctuation of the immunization coverage in the last 8 years inFigure 1A. Although there was a decrease in absolute number of vaccination shots, the PNI had increased the variety of vaccines offered during the same timeframe: itoffered 11 vaccines in 1994 and increased to 36 vaccines in 2019 (Supplementary File 1). A closer, look at the profiles of each specific vaccine offered in 2019 revealed that 44.44% (n=16) of those had a decrease in the number of applied doses, whereas 22.22% (n=8) exhibited increases in the number of doses in comparison with the last 2 years (2017 and 2018). The differences in proportions of vaccinations across these years was substantially different, with p<0.001 evaluated by the chi-square test (Figure 1B). We next profiled the vaccination coverage among the different country regions (Figure 2A). We detected a reduction in the absolute numbers of vaccination shots occurring in all regions in the last three years, mirroring the overall reduction observed in the whole country (Figure 1), except the South region which presented an increase in the number of vaccination in the last three years (Figure 2A). Although the reduction in the absolute number, the linear regression analysis revealed just a slight decline in the North, Northeast and Midwest regions in the last three years (Figure 2B). The region presenting with more significant reduction in vaccination coverage was the Northeast, which exhibited a decrease of 1,162,122 vaccines in 2018 in comparison with 2017 and 1,344,017 in 2019 in comparison with 2018 (representing 4.05% and 4,68% reduction respectively in the number of vaccinations). The variety of vaccines offered in all regions increased in 2019, tested by chi-square test (p<0.001; Figure 2C). After describing the overall changes in vaccination coverage observed in Brazil studied period, we investigated the of coverage of each specific vaccine in 2019. Using the Venn diagram approach, we observed that 7 vaccines were identified as displaying a reduction in the number of shots in all Brazilian regions in 2019 when compared with 2018 (Figure 3A). Interestingly, all of the 7 vaccines identified were doses given to babies and children and are recommended by the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. Several vaccines presented a specific reduction in coverage in some regions such as OPV (Oral Poliovirus) in the South; Tdap (acellular triple vaccine -Pertussis, Tetanus, and Diphtheria), Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) and PCV13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate) in the Southeast; and Measles-Rubella and MMRV (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella) vaccines in the Northeast. On the other hand, only 2 vaccines, meningococcal ACYW, and varicella vaccines had an increase in immunization doses in 2019 for all regions (Fig 3B).Only in the South region, yellow fever and Td (diphtheria and tetanus for adults) vaccines have shown an increase in immunization doses.To investigate the evidence of reduction in the number of vaccinations in Brazil, a timeseries analysis was performed using data from 2004 to 2019. The number of applied vaccines in Brazil was higher in June, August and May, with lower vaccination doses being applied in December and November (Figure 4A). The time-series pattern was extracted from the data by a decomposing technique (described in Methods), using the forecast modelling.",

This phenomenon had a strong association with measles, mumps and pertussis outbreaks in the United States (Ventola 2016; Goldani 2017; Smith 2017; Paniz-Mondolfi et al. 2019). Recently, measles outbreaks have also occurred in South American countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil (Dias Leite and Naaman Berezin 2015). These outbreaks have brought attention to the public health systems of such countries about the importance of improvements in their vaccination surveillance and control strategies (Silveira et al. 2020). According to our results, in 2019 seven vaccines showed a reduction in doses applied in Brazil when compared with the previous year, all of these being used for the immunization of children. Our study findings from Brazil are in direct agreement with the idea that there has been a recent decrease in vaccination coverage in other countries.",

These modeling approaches are based on the mathematical properties of the time series and do not consider other aspects related with the event, in our case the population behavior or socioeconomic.The socioeconomic inequities may have played an important role in this reduction reported here. A study evaluating four birth cohorts between 1982 -2015 conducted in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, demonstrated that there was a shift in vaccination coverage through those years (Dias Leite and Naaman Berezin 2015). The authors have shown that vaccination coverage in the 1980s was higher in wealthy families and such socioeconomic inequality had reduced in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2015, the vaccination coverage profile was reversed, with children from better-off families presenting lower coverage. This misleading assumption could make them feel able to criticize medical science regarding vaccines, tending them to believe in alternative non-scientific facts found in the internet (Dias Leite and Naaman Berezin 2015). Vaccination hesitancy is not the only factor responsible for lower vaccination coverage. Political conflicts, socioeconomic collapse, and difficulties to bring vaccines to remote areas, such as indigenous and rural communities, have been",
