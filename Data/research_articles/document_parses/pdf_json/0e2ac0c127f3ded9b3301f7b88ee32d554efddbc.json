It introduces a new dimension to aviation security in that, within the conventional machine readable passport with its machine readable zone, an additional layer of verification of information contained in an electronic chip is placed, which verifies the information in the passport's machine readable zone by the use of a special reader. Much research has gone into the areas of the technology and verification in the development of the ePassport. At a Symposium held at the International Civil Aviation Organization in early October 2012, the ePassport was subjected to much discussion by the various experts gathered from across the globe. This article discusses these deliberations and places them against the backdrop of the privacy of the individual and aviation security law.",

The additional feature that the ePassport carries in the conventional machine readable passport is a chip containing biometric and biographic information which have to be validated accurately, efficiently and quickly while retaining the security and integrity of the information. Ideally, an ePassport should be issued in accordance with the technical specifications approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 1 However, this does not happen in all cases of issuance of ePassports. This lapse could seriously compromise global security. The nuances of this threat are described and discussed in this article against their legal background.",

Biometric identification has been defined as \"a generic term used to 1 ICAO is the specialized agency of the United Nations handling issues of international civil aviation. ICAO was established by the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed at Chicago on 7 December 1944 (Chicago Convention). One of the overarching objectives of ICAO, as contained in Article 44 of the Convention is to foster the planning and development of international air transport so as to meet the needs of the peoples for safe, regular, efficient and economical air transport. ICAO has 191 member States, who become members of ICAO by ratifying or otherwise issuing notice of adherence to the Chicago Convention. See ICAO Doc 7300/9 Ninth Edition 2006. 2 Machine Readable Travel Documents Part 1 Volume 2 ICAO Doc 9303 Sixth Edition: 2006, at Page II-3 at Paragraph 6.1, Definitions. 3 See The Facilitation Manual, Doc 9957, ICAO: Montreal, First Edition 2011, Definitions at X. ICAO has been working on the development of passports since 1968. The Seventh Session of the ICAO Facilitation Division in 1968 recommended that a small panel of qualified experts including representatives of the passports and/or other border control authorities, be established: to determine the establishment of an appropriate document such as a passport card, a normal passport or an identity document with electronically or mechanically readable inscriptions that meet the requirements of document control; the best type of procedures, systems (electronic or mechanical) and equipment for use with the above documents that are within the resources and ability of Member States; the feasibility of standardizing the requisite control information and methods of providing this information through automated processes, provided that these processes would meet the requirements of security, speed of handling and economy of operation. 4 http://www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec/programs/content_multi_image_0021.shtm 5 To \"verify\" means to perform a one-to-one match between proffered biometric data obtained from the holder of the travel document at the time of inquiry with the details of a biometric template created when the holder enrolled in the system. describe automated means of recognizing a living person through the measurement of distinguishing physiological or behavioural traits\". 6 Biometrics target the distinguishing physiological or behavioral traits of the individual by measuring them and placing them in an automated repository such as machine encoded representations created by computer software algorithms that could make comparisons with the actual features. Physiological biometrics that have been found to successfully accommodate this scientific process are facial recognition, fingerprinting and irisrecognition which have been selected by ICAO as being the most appropriate. The biometric identification process is fourfold: firstly involving the capture or acquisition of the biometric sample; secondly extracting or converting the raw biometric sample obtained into an intermediate form; and thirdly creating templates of the intermediate data is converted into a template for storage; and finally the comparison stage where the information offered by the travel document with that which is stored in the reference template.",

This measure not only ensures that the holder of the document is the legitimate claimant to that document and to whom it was issued, but also enhances the efficacy of any advance passenger information (API) 8 system used by the State to pre-determine the arrivals to its territory. Furthermore, matching biometric data presented in the form of the traveler with the data contained in the template accurately ascertains as to whether the travel document has been tampered with or not. A three way check, which matches the traveler's biometrics with those stored in the template carried in the document and a central database, is an even more efficacious way of determining the genuineness of a travel document. The final and most efficient biometric check is when a four way determine is effected, were the digitized photograph is visually matched (non electronically) with the three way check described above. 9 In this context, it is always recommended that the traveler's facial image (conventional photograph) should be incorporated in the travel document along with the biometric templates in order to ensure that his identity could be verified at locations where there is no direct access to a central database or where the biometric identification process has not entered into the legal process of that location. 6 Machine Readable Travel Documents Part 1 Volume 2, Supra note 2 at Page II-3 at Paragraph 4.1. 7 The Chicago Convention, supra, note 1, defines, in Article 2, \"territory of a State\" as the land areas and territorial waters adjacent to the State under the sovereignty, suzerainty, protection and mandate of such State. 8 API involves exchange of data information between airlines and customs authorities, where an incoming passenger's essential details are notified electronically by the airline carrying that passenger prior to his arrival. The data for API would be stored in the passenger's machine readable passport, in its machine readable zone. This process enables customs authorities to process passengers quickly, thus ensuring a smoother and faster clearance at the customs barriers at airports. One of the drawbacks of this system, which generally works well and has proven to be effective, is that it is quite demanding in terms of the high level of accuracy required. One of the major advantages, on the other hand, is the potential carried by the API process in enhancing aviation security at airports and during flight. See Abeyratne (2002a, b) 9 Issuing States must ensure the accuracy of the biometric matching technology used and functions of the systems employed if the integrity of the conducted checks are to be maintained. They must also have realistic and efficient criteria regarding the number of travel documents checked per minute in a border control situation and follow a regular biometric identification approach such as facial recognition, fingerprint examination or iris identification system.",

The establishment of a public key directory, through means of public key cryptology and in a PKI environment, is consistent with ICAO's ultimate aim and vision for the application of biometric technology on the fundamental postulate that there must be a primary interoperable form of biometric technology for use at border control with facilities for verification, as well as by carriers and the issuers of documents. This initial premise is inevitably followed by the assumption that biometric technologies used by document issuers must have certain specifications, particularly for purposes of identification, verification and the creation of watch lists. It is also ICAO's vision that States, to the extent possible, are protected against changing infrastructure and changing suppliers, and that a technology, once put in place, must be operable or at least retrievable for a period of ten years.",

[Westin (1970)] The role played by technology in modern day commercial transactions has affected a large number of activities pertaining to human interaction. The emergence of the information superhighway and the concomitant evolution of automation have inevitably transformed the social and personal life styles and value systems of individuals, created unexpected business opportunities, reduced operating costs, accelerated transaction times, facilitated accessibility to communications, shortened distances, and removed bureaucratic formalities. [Orwell (1984) ] Progress notwithstanding, technology has bestowed on humanity its corollaries in the nature of automated mechanisms, devices, features, and procedures which intrude into personal lives of individuals. For instance, when a credit card is used, it is possible to track purchases, 14 (Abeyratne 2001 (Young 1978) . 16 As far back as in 1973 it was claimed that ten reels, each containing 1,500 m of tape 2.5 cm wide, could store a twenty page dossier on every man, woman, and child in the world. See (Jones 1973). discovering numerous aspects about that particular individual, including, food inclination, leisure activities, and consumer credit behaviour. 17 In similar vein, computer records of an air carrier's reservation system may give out details of the passenger's travel preferences, inter alia, seat selection, destination fondness, ticket purchasing dossier, lodging keenness, temporary address and telephone contacts, attendance at theatres and sport activities, and whether the passenger travels alone or with someone else. 18 In similar vein, does it follow that a full body scanning exercise would reveal imperfections of the human body which person would desire to keep private? This scheme of things may well give the outward perception of surveillance attributable to computer devices monitoring individuals' most intimate activities, preferences and physical attributes, leading to the formation of a genuine \"traceable society\". 19 The main feature of this complex web of technological activity is that an enormous amount of personal information handled by such varied players from the public and private sector, may bring about concerns of possible \"data leaks\" in the system, a risk that could have drastic legal consequences affecting an individual's rights to privacy.",

A contrario to the argument supported in this thesis that the advancement of technology directly affects the intimacy of individuals. U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner favours the idea that other factors, such as urbanisation, income, and mobility development have particularly weakened the information control that, for instance, the government has over individuals: this denotes that individuals' privacy has increased. See Posner (1978) . 20 The text reads: \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks\". See Universal Declaration of Human Rights. enlarging its scope to include privacy as the individual's decision -making right, 23 and culminating in the control over one's personal information. 24 Thus, the conceptual evolution of privacy is directly related to the technological advancement of each particular period in history.",

This idea was given further impetus by two prominent young lawyers, Samuel D. Warren and Louis D. Brandeis, 25 in 1890. 26 Before this idea was introduced, the concept of privacy reflected primarily a somewhat physical property or life. The foundations of \"information privacy\", whereby the individuals would determine when, how, and to what extent information about themselves would be communicated to others, inextricably drawing the right of control of information about oneself, 27 is a cornerstone of privacy. With the development of computer capabilities to handle large amounts of data, privacy has been enlarged to include the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of personal information Reidenberg (1995) . The notion of informational privacy protection, a typically American usage, has been particularly popular both in the United States and Europe, where the term \"data protection\" is used. 28 Self-determination in the right to protect one's privacy was first judicially embraced by the German Bundesverfassungsgericht in 1983. 29 The US Supreme court followed this trend by adopting the principle of privacy self-determination in DOJ v.",

This information may not later be used for commercial or other gain for instance for advertising purposes (such as using the physical profile of a prominent actor or actress whose biometric information originally given for customs clearance). 33 The protection of human rights is the most significant and important task for a modern State, particularly since multi ethnic States are the norm in today's world. Globalization and increased migration across borders is gradually putting an end to the concept of the nation State, although resistance to reality can be still seen in instances where majority or dominant cultures impose their identity and interests on groups with whom they share a territory. In such instances, minorities frequently intensify their efforts to preserve and protect their identity, in order to avoid marginalization. Polarization between the opposite forces of assimilation on the one hand and protection of minority identity on the other inevitably causes increased intolerance and eventual armed ethnic conflict. In such a scenario, the first duty of governance is to ensure that the rights of a minority society are protected. 30 See Halpin (1997) at 111. See also Foschio (1990) . For a comprehensive study on the conflictive interest on privacy and the mass media and the Freedom of Speech, see Pember (1972); Prowda (1995) . See also J. Montgomery Curtis Memorial Seminar (1992 The foregoing discussion addressed the right of privacy of the individual which is paramount over most legal considerations. The only factor that would override this would be the security of State. Inherent to the concept of security of State is State responsibility 34 to its citizens and others who are in its territory. The fundamental issue in the context of State responsibility for the purposes of this article is to consider whether a State should be considered responsible for its own failure or non-feasance to prevent a private act of terrorism against civil aviation or whether the conduct of the State itself can be impugned by identifying a nexus between the perpetrator's conduct and the State. One view is that an agency paradigm, which may in some circumstances impute to a state reprehensibility on the ground that a principal-agent relationship between the State and the perpetrator existed, can obfuscate the issue and preclude one from conducting a meaningful legal study of the State's conduct. 35 Security It is incontrovertible that in issuing an ePassport, the State concerned ensures aviation security not only in its own territory but also in the territory of the State to which the ePassport holder travels. New and emerging threats to civil aviation are a constant cause for concern to the aviation community. Grave threats such as those posed by the carriage of explosives and dangerous pathogens on board, are real and have to be addressed with vigour and regularity. The leakage of dangerous pathogens 36 from laboratories also presents an ominous analogy to the aviation sector in that the same could well occur in the carriage of such dangerous goods by air (Abeyratne 2007) . Although past instances of the escape of dangerous pathogens are small in number, nonetheless their occurrence and the threat posed to the wellbeing of humanity cannot be underestimated. In 2002 when Anthrax spores escaped from two military laboratories in the United States, the authorities agreed that the leakage was due to a security lapse. 37 In 2003 a string of such leakages occurred in Asia, this time of the SARS virus. 38 ICAO has been addressing these threats for some time and continues to do so on a global basis, particularly with regard to the impact of unpredictable security measures on passenger confidence in aviation security. There has been much support for this approach because of its value as a deterrent. It has been suggested that States adopt an approach providing for a baseline regime, but with the addition of unpredictable measures, thus achieving a balance between certainty and unpredictability. 34 For an in-depth discussion of State Responsibility see Abeyratne (2009) . 35 Caron (1998 ) cited in Becker (2006 . 36 Pathogens are microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, parasites, fungi) or recombinant microorganisms (hybrid or mutant) that are known or are reasonably expected to cause infectious disease in humans or animals. 37 An year earlier, a covert event occurred in October 2001 when anthrax spores were sent through the mail exposing persons in the eastern USA to contaminated mail resulting in deaths, illnesses and identified exposures to Anthrax. Overt, announced events, in which persons are warned that an exposure has occurred, have taken place in the United States, although most of these were determined to have been hoaxes, that is, there were no true exposures to infectious agents. 38 The security ensured by the introduction of the ePassport undoubtedly has its genesis in the maintenance of international peace and security is an important objective of the United Nations, 39 which recognizes one of its purposes as being inter alia:",

            "text": "Liability of the manufacturer of the electronic chip, often a private entity, and the State is a significant factor in this equation. Ultimately, even though the chip incorporated in the ePassport is the creation of a public or private entity, is so incorporated in a State documenti.e. the passport, and therefore the State is ultimately liable for defects in the passport. State liability under administrative law can in turn be divided into two limbs: liability for acts of instrumentalities of State; and liability for privatized service providers for whose acts, relating to the provision of technical services, the State would still bear responsibility. The traditional model of administrative responsibility and accountability of the administrative State is based on the premise that Parliament controlled the executive but was in turn controlled by the people. Added to this, the fundamental postulate lay in the overarching principle that the judiciary played its role in keeping instrumentalities and agencies of the State intact. Accountability of the State for its agencies' actions was two fold: one stemming from a statutory power given to that agency by the State; and the other arising from delegation of authority by the State to the agency concerned. In the latter instance, however, the legislature could intervene and share some control of the agency. This gave rise to the inexorable principle that administrative law and judgments of courts on such agencies could be involved only in the former instance, when the State had provided a statutory base for a private agency or entity. In the 1983 British case of O'Reilly & Mackman, 41 the House of Lords limited the circumstances in which a public law remedy, such as a declaratory judgment or injunction, could be brought outside of Section 31 of the Supreme Court Act of 1918, which prescribed instances of legal actions to be brought against the State for an act of its statutory agent. This is notwithstanding the fact that Section 21 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1949 allows the Court in civil proceedings to issue a declaratory order against the State, although there could be no injunction specific performance orders against a State. Furthermore, a later case established that although the claim for judicial review might be brought against the Crown, the Crown's involvement is merely nominal and the ultimate dispute would be between the claimant and the defendant. 42 In the instance of a privatized service provider, the situation calls for a discussion of the reasons for privatization leading to the legal nature of a privatized entity. 44 The reasons for privatization could well range from improvement of efficiency to reducing government involvement in industrial decision making. The corollaries to privatization are often the widening of share ownership; encouraging share ownership by employees; providing more flexibility to pay policies; and enhancement of economic freedom. There could be two types of privatized service providers: the first being large companies which were once instrumentalities of state, which, even after privatization, do not possess potential for undue competition in the market. These would easily transit to a position in which large companies had been private in the first place, and would not be subject to principles of public law. The second category of the privatized service provider is one which has market power and consequent potential for untrammelled competition. In such cases, the State may regulate the provider by bringing it under the administrative purview of a State agency. These privatized bodies may be vulnerable under public law through the agencies having administrative control over them.",

The Director General of Telecommunications, established by the Act, can grant licenses to operators of telecom systems. The Director General is also empowered to refer a matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, particularly on issues related to public interest such as pricing.

The like uniform conditions shall apply to the use, by aircraft of every Contracting State, of all air navigation facilities, including radio and meteorological services, which may be provided for public use for the safety and expedition of air navigation services.

The first came in the form of the 1948 Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control), Act which devolved regulatory responsibility on an agencythe Monopolies and Restriction Practices Commission (MRPC) -a body outside the normal departmental framework. The second stage commenced with the 1956 Restrictive Trade Practices Act which addressed the competitive threat of cartels and the Restrictive Practices Court was established to adjudicate an anti-competitive and privy issues. The third stage took on with the expansion of the Monopolies Commission which investigates monopolies issues. Merger irregularities were added to the jurisdiction of the Commission with the Monopolies and Mergers Act of 1968. The 1980 Competition Act which followed gave the Commission power to investigate particular anti-competitive practices. The final stage of the evaluation demarcates choice of institutions to investigate and adjudicate on anti-competitive practices. From an administrative perspective, the citizen has been known to challenge these State instrumentalities, 49 the most notable of which has been the challenge offered to the various governmental institutions created under Statute to define their extent of duty to give reasons for competition legislation. 50 A Government's approach to regulation of a public utility, whether public or privatized, is usually based on the public interest rationale where individual consumer choice will determine the demand and supply for goods and their pricing and quantity (Ogus 1994) . In the United Kingdom, these factors are intrinsically related to transparency, accountability, proportionality, consistency and targeting. 51",

For this, there must be a clear definition of State responsibility and accountability brought to bear by a close and unbreakable link between government and industry stakeholders. A security culture would make States aware of their rights and duties, and, more importantly, enable States to assert them. Those who belong to a security culture also know which conduct would compromise security and they are quick to educate and caution those who, out of ignorance, forgetfulness, or personal weakness, partake in insecure conduct. An ePassport must necessarily be the result of efficient and fail-safe organizational arrangements. It should be tested at border control by trained professionals. eGovernment and eID are the bare essentials for State security. The digital economy has also brought much facilitation that helps the world move to paperless processes which result in greater economy and streamlined processes. However, there must essentially be global harmonization in this process. In this regard ICAO has made remarkable progress in advancing its MRTD programme to the level it is at now. If harmonization means ensuring consistency between global practices, standardization means compliance with international Standards. There is no room for doubt that both harmonization and globalization are needed in this context.",
