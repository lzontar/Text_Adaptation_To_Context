On Day 16, a respiratory virus panel detected parainfluenza 4 virus besides the already known SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities, and crazy paving with negligible pleural effusions (Figure 1). Additionally, CLL progression was evident with enlarged mediastinal plus bilateral axillary lymph nodes and splenomegaly.

Patients with leukemia are known for an increased risk for serious parainfluenza virus infections with significant mortality rate.5 The patient was transferred to MICU, and despite recommendations favoring early intubation, we treated the patient with high-flow oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula and reassessed the respiratory situation frequently. By this conservative strategy, we were able to avoid emergency intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation, which is associated with high mortality in cancer patients per se.
