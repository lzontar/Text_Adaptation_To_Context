Moreover, fear that restrictive measures may negatively affect cancer management and prognosis may fuel patients' anger and mistrust, leading to low compliance to such measures: in a moment of extreme vulnerability, patient mind activates coping mechanisms that focus on their primary objective, cancer treatment, confining the fear of the infection in the background [20] . Adequate and timely information, an effective doctor-patient relationship, and prompt psychological support are critical to transcend the new physical barriers represented by masks and remote assistance [21] [22] [23] . This conclusion is supported by our data on patients' reported perception of restrictive measures: even though approximately 30% of patients still feared the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the vast majority felt well informed and acceptance of the adopted measures was very high (>80%).",

            "text": "Data reported on SARS-CoV-2 infections in Oncology healthcare professionals and oncological patients are meant to be purely descriptive and have no epidemiological value. The Wuhan Union hospital reported a 1.7% infection rate among healthcare workers [24] and in Italy, more than 21.800 healthcare workers were confirmed as infected [25] . However, epidemiological conclusions cannot be presently drawn, as testing strategies vary widely across different hospitals and within the same hospital; in addition, close contacts of positive oncology healthcare professionals were aggressively tracked down and none tested positive. Importantly, only 1 of the positive health professionals was actually in contact with oncological patients and colleagues in charge of \"clean\" oncological activity, supporting the effectiveness of a segregated-team model in containing infection risks [18] . With regard to cases of infection in our cancer patient population, we elected to collect and analyse only cases requiring hospital admission, for whom we had a reliable source of information and a precise reference population. A recent epidemiological study conducted in the Veneto region indicates a 0.3% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among male cancer patients, with a slightly but significantly higher odds ratio, as compared to the general population [OR: 1.79 (1.62-1.98) , P<0.0001] [26] ; however, these data should be interpreted with caution, since neither all cancer patients nor the general population have been systematically tested and NPS may not detect a resolved past infection, thus potentially underestimating the actual prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Whether incidence and clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in oncological patients is different from those in the general population remains to be answered. Currently available series are limited and convey conflicting results [5] [6] [7] [27] [28] [29] ; larger, well-designed, epidemiological studies will need to be conducted, perhaps using serological approaches [30] , to definitively address these questions.",

However, the experience we report herein suggests that timely and thoughtful adoption of organizational and protective measures, coordinated efforts of all the figures involved in modern cancer care (physicians, psychologists, nurses, auxiliary and support personnel), and effective communication strategies to frankly share risks and needed sacrifices with patients/caregivers [22] can lead to effective protection of healthcare workers and cancer patients alike, while minimally disrupting adequate cancer care.
