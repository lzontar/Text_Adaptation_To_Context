It is moreover interesting to note that there are numerous cases with high IgG even after the first days of symptoms. It must be emphasized that the incubation time of the disease varies from 2 to a maximum of 14 days (6) , and therefore it is also conceivable that cases with early high IgG may be related to patients with longer incubation times. However, in our case series the onset of the appearance of the serological response remains rather short, especially in consideration of the limited presence of IgM, which seems to have a parallel trend but with much lower concentrations than IgG. The study of 9 cases with at least 3 samples each, confirms the increase in IgG and the tendency to a plateau after 15 days ( figure 2 ).",

Clinical correlations None of the 35 control samples resulted positive for IgM and IgG. Forty-seven cases (61%) were positive for IgM, while 66 cases (85.7%) were positive and 2 in gray zone for IgG. The correlation of the results with respect to the days of the onset of the symptoms is shown in Figure 1. We have distinguished the cases of samples analyzed before 15 days of illness (Group 1) from those analyzed 15 or more days later (group 2). In Group 1 the positivity rate was 71,1% (27 samples out of 38) but we found 100% positivity rate in the remaining 39 samples collected more than 15 days after the symptoms (Group 2).The median concentration was 24.4 U/mL (25\u00b0-75\u00b0 perc: 0.92-50.6) in Group 1 and 60.6 U/mL (25\u00b0-75\u00b0 perc: 29.9-66.5) in Group 2 (Mann-Whitney test p=0.0003).",
