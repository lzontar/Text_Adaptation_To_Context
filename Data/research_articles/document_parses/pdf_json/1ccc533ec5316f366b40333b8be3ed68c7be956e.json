In addition, he complained about diarrhoea and weight loss of 4 kg during the past four months. His medical history was unremarkable. He was not known to be HIV-positive. On examination, the patient was alert and oriented, but in respiratory distress. His temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, blood pressure 110/ 45 mmHg, pulse 127 min -1 ; the respirations were 50-60 breaths per minute, with an oxygen saturation of 50% without supplemental oxygen. Chest examination did not reveal rhonchi or crackles. The axillary and inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged; the remainder of the examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed extensive diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates ( Figure 1a ). An electrocardiogram was unremarkable. Laboratory test results included a mild normocytic anaemia with a haemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dl, a lymphocytopaenia with 410 cells/ll, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 175 mg/l (<5), an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 2,640 U/l (240-420) and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 130 U/l (10-50). A blood gas analysis with room air revealed a partial pressure of O 2 (pO 2 ) of 5.1 kPa, a partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) of 3.5 kPa and a pH of 7.47. An HIV test turned out to be positive. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Besides ceftriaxone and clarithromycin, high-dose trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and prednisone were started. During the next day, his condition worsened, with increasing dyspnoea and respiratory exhaustion and mechanical ventilation was required. His CD4 cell count was 21 cells/ll and an HIV-1 viral load was 348,000 copies/ml. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. In Giemsa and indirect immunofluorescence stains, toxoplasma tachyzoites were identified (Figure 1b, c). There was no evidence of Pneumocystis jirovecii and acid-fast bacilli. Toxoplasma serology turned out to be highly positive with IgG > 549 IU/l and negative IgM antibodies. Pulmonary toxoplasmosis with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a patient with advanced HIV infection was diagnosed. Therapy was changed to sulphadiazine and pyrimethamine plus folinic acid. After three days, the patient was extubated and he subsequently ",

HIV serology turned out to be positive. The CD4 cell count was 5 cells/ll and HIV1-RNA 1,620,000 copies/ml. Assays for toxoplasma antibodies were positive for IgG (not quantified) and negative for IgM. An electrocardiogram was normal. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral, diffuse patchy infiltrates and increased interstitial striation. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan also showed bilateral, patchy infiltrates (Figure 1d ) and in a cranial CT scan, edema and midline shift was found. One day later, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple abscesses. Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma was ruled out by positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A BAL was performed: the Giemsa-stained specimen revealed tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, together with cysts of P. jirovecii (Figure 1e ) that were confirmed by toluidine blue O staining (Figure 1f ) and immunofluorescence staining (not shown). Pulmonary and cerebral toxoplasmosis with contemporaneous pulmonary pneumocystis infection was diagnosed. Treatment with sulphadiazine, pyrimethamine, folinic acid and atovaquone was started. The former drug was prescribed instead of trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole to minimise sulphonamide toxicity. In the following several days, the patient's condition progressively improved. After 17 days, he was discharged from the hospital.",

As toxoplasma pneumonitis is clinically difficult do diagnose and is associated with a considerable mortality, it is necessary to force the diagnosis by the microbiological examination of respiratory samples. Especially in patients with severe clinical pictures or not responding to therapy, it is judicious to perform a BAL with cytological examination of BAL fluid, using appropriate special stains to detect toxoplasma organisms. In both of our cases, early diagnosis led to a favourable outcome.",
