One of the major problems of modern chemotherapy is the disappointing efficacy when using available drugs against resistant bacterial strains. Natural antibiotics, i.e., antibiotics produced by various microorganisms, have been and continue to be an important source of new highly active antimicrobial and antitumour agents. One of the most relevant approaches to the design of new drugs relies on targeted chemical transformations of natural antibiotics. 1 In the world science, considerable efforts are currently underway to combat the problem of resistance of microorganisms to available drugs. However, in comparison with other drugs, the development of new antibiotics is not carried out sufficiently. The design of anti-infective drugs and the creation of marketable products are still a challenge. 2 Since the development of medicines for the treatment of chronic diseases is much more profitable and because of high requirements for safety, large cap pharmaceutical companies (big pharma) shut down their antibiotic research projects. Currently, small-and medium-sized enterprises are developing a majority of new drugs through investments, venture capital, etc. Because of high demands for new anti-infective drugs and extremely high cost of these works, cross-country collaborations are needed for research in this field. Only a few new compounds were approved for therapeutic use in human medicine or have completed phase-III clinical trials. 3 The problems are compounded by the fact that the increasing percentage of the population, particularly in developed countries and Russia, suffer from infections that were not earlier dangerous, i.e., from opportunistic infections. This is due to a significant decrease in the immune status of the population caused by natural or man-made factors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 550, "end": 551, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 899, "end": 900, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1549, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The translation of semi-synthetic antitumour antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin) into clinics resulted in the development of gold standard chemotherapeutic agents. Many antibiotics have made a great contribution to understanding of mechanisms of development of resistance in bacterial and tumour cells. Due to high innate or acquired drug resistance of cancer cells, chemotherapy of malignant tumours is often ineffective. The international research community has focused its attention on the search for new, more effective and less toxic antitumour agents. One of the most rational approaches to the targeted therapy is based on the search for inhibitors of important tumour cell targets among natural products, primarily antibiotics. 4 Even the repurposing of known antitumour antibiotics is considered in order to address the problem of antibiotic resistance of antiinfective agents. 5 Researchers of the Gause Institute of New Antibiotics (GINA) headed by Academician of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences G.F.Gause in the 1960 \u00b1 1990s made considerable contribution to the discovery of a series of original antibacterial and antitumour agents (a total of 15 compounds), their characterization and introduction to medical practice. Major achievements of the Institute during this period are considered in the review. 6 Antibiotics comprise an important class of natural products with unique structural diversity. Chemical transformations of natural antibiotics imply a change of particular functional groups of the starting molecules with preservation of structural elements responsible for biological activity. The structure determines the possibility of chemical transformation of the antibiotic and reaction conditions. For example, many antibiotics contain nitrogenous and(or) nitrogen-free sugars, which are easily eliminated in acidic or alkaline media. Many antibiotics are sensitive to oxidants, are poorly soluble in organic media or, on the contrary, in aqueous solutions, etc. On the other hand, in the case of similar structures of certain moieties [e.g., the presence of NH 2 , CO 2 H, OH, C(O), etc. groups)], methods developed for one class of antibiotics can be applied to antibiotics of another class. The goal of synthetic chemists is to transform natural products with preservation of the sites responsible for biological activity. Besides, targeted modification can be performed to gain better understanding of the mechanisms of action, in particular in order to investigate the interaction between the antibiotic and the target.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 732, "end": 733, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 883, "end": 884, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1320, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this review, the following classes of compounds are considered as scaffolds for the synthesis of new antibiotics: polycyclic glycopeptides of the vancomycin \u00b1 teicoplanin group, classical macrolides, macrolides of the amphotericin B \u00b1 oligomycin group, anthracyclines, aureolic acid derivatives, heliomycin, synthetic benzoxaboroles and some other antibiotics.

They are commonly applied for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive cocci, particularly, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. Glycopeptide antibiotics bind with high affinity to the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala group of the growing peptidoglycan chain on the outer bacterial cell wall, thereby inhibiting the enzymes transpeptidase and transglycosylase. The vancomycin resistance in enterococcus strains (VRE) (for VanA and VanB phenotypes) arises due to replacement of the D-Ala-D-Ala group by D-Ala-D-lactate, which weakly interacts with the antibiotic. Semi-synthetic glycopeptide analogues, such as oritavancin, telavancin and dalbavancin, have recently been used worldwide in medicine. These drugs only partially solve the problem of the treatment of infectious diseases caused by vancomycinresistant enterococci. 7, 8 The search for more effective glycopeptide analogues is an ongoing process. 7 \u00b1 9 Eremomycin 3 (see Fig. 1 ), the natural antibiotic of this group, was discovered in the Gause Institute of New Antibiotics. 17 This compound differs from vancomycin (1) by the absence of a chlorine atom and the presence of the additional amino sugar eremosamine in the side group of amino acid 6 (AA6), as well as by the structure of the amino sugar (4 H -epivancosamine or eremosamine) at the D-glucopyranose moiety attached to AA4.

The mechanism of their action is related to the interaction with the decoding site (A site) of the 16S subunit of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), which leads to disturbance of translation, i.e., protein biosynthesis. According to the literature data, a number of semi-synthetic derivatives of a new generation were synthesized based on aminoglycosides. 33 Various heterodimeric aminoglycoside conjugates with other antibiotics were reported, and some of them are used in medicine. 28, 29 The synthesis of hybrid kanamycin A conjugates with glycopeptides 1 and 3 was described for the first time in our publication. 34 Kanamycin A (26a) was conjugated with compounds 1 or 3 via an amino group of the antibiotic at the 1 position of 2-deoxy-D-streptamine. The acylation of this amino group is known to reduce the risk of the development of resistance, because it prevents deactivation of the antibiotic by enzymes. The amino group at the 3 position of 2-deoxy-Dstreptamine and the 6 H -amino group of 6 H -deoxy-6 H -amino-D-glucopyranose of aminoglycoside 26a were protected by the benzyloxycarbonyl group (Cbz). 3,6 H -Bis-(Cbz)-kanamycin A (26b) was synthesized by the reaction of the zinc complex of compound 26a with CbzCl in the presence of a base (Et 3 N) using a modified method 35 (Scheme 8).

Two semi-synthetic derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics have completed phase 3 clinical trials and were approved by the United State Food and Drug Administration (FDA): chloroeremomycin (discovered by Eli Lilly, acquired by The Medicine Co in 2009) and dalbavancin (discovered by LePetit; acquired by Pfizer in 2005). 8, 10 The drawbacks of vancomycin are the poor accumulation within tissues, because of which it is not used in the treatment of, for example, pneumonia, and a pronounced pseudoallergic reaction typical of glycopeptides.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 143, "end": 145, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 146, "end": 148, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 149, "end": 151, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 801, "end": 803, "text": "8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 804, "end": 806, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Research in international cooperation showed the promise of chemical transformations of the antibiotic eremomycin belonging to this group of glycopeptide antibiotics. Eremomycin is a highly active domestic antibiotic that suppresses the growth of Gram-positive organisms; it is 3 \u00b1 5 times more effective than vancomycin but is inactive against drug-resistant strains of staphylococci and enterococci. 6 Original approaches and methods were developed under the supervision of Professor M.N.Preobrazhenskaya in the Gause Institute of New Antibiotics. These methods can be applied to prepare derivatives of antibiotics of this group with desired properties. In 2006, the method for the synthesis of glycopeptide analogues was protected by an international patent. 18 Promising analogues, various N H -derivatives and carboxamides of eremomycin, were synthesized. These derivatives compare favourably in efficacy against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of staphylococci and enterococci with the related vancomycin derivatives and they are even more effective in a number of assays. 12 \u00b1 15 Some carboxamides show no allergenicity. 13 Other derivatives (e.g., the adamantane derivative of eremomycin) are promising as a protection against biological risks because they were found to be active against the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, including fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. 15 High activity of the resulting hydrophobic glycopeptide derivatives can be attributed to the dual mechanism of action on Gram-positive bacteria. 20, 21 Modifications of aglycones of glycopeptide antibiotics with hydrophobic substituents resulted in the discovery of a new class of polycyclic peptides active against a large group of enveloped viruses, such as HIV 23 or hepatitis C virus. 25 Studies on the mechanisms of antiviral activity are currently ongoing. It was suggested that protein kinase is one of possible targets for this agluco analogue, because antiviral activity was shown to correlate with the inhibition of serine/ threonine protein kinases. 27 Comprehensive research on the synthesis and characterization of heterodimeric conjugates based on different classes of antibiotics was initiated in the Gause Institute of New Antibiotics under the supervision of Professor M.N.Preobrazhenskaya. The following hybrid antibiotics were synthesized: glycopeptide \u00b1 macrolide, glycopeptide \u00b1 aminoglycoside and hybrid compounds containing the benzoxaborole chromophore. The literature data provide evidence that this line of research holds promise. 28, 29 Macrolides modified through the carbamoyl group at the 4 HH position can acquire activity against drug-resistant bacterial cell lines. Generally, conjugates containing a long spacer exhibit higher activity than the related compounds with a shorter spacer. 40, 41 Investigations of interactions between different benzoxaboroles and antibiotics made a significant contribution to the chemistry of not only antibiotics with complex structures but also the relatively poorly studied borole compounds. Benzoxaboroles were found to be quite stable under different reaction conditions. In particular, the acylation, amidation and reductive alkylation with reactive agents and on heating are virtually not accompanied by oxaborole ring opening. 32 The introduction of the benzoxaborole substituent into the polyene macrolide amphotericin B (AmB) also enhances biological activity. The resulting compounds possess valuable properties, such as lower cytotoxic and haemolytic activity compared to AmB combined with high antifungal activity. 52 The efficiency of the approach to the design of antibiotics of a new generation was demonstrated in relation to antifungal polyene macrolides. It is based on a combination of genetic engineering techniques and methods of organic synthesis 48 \u00b1 50 and is protected by an international patent. 46 The chemical modification of polyene antibiotics, which were obtained via the genetic engineering of nystatin A1 biosynthesis at the Norwegian University, gave a series of agents exhibiting lower toxicity and higher activity compared to amphotericin B in animal assays. The dependence of antifungal activity on the structure of the polyol region [C(7) \u00b1 C(10)] of these antibiotics was revealed for the first time by Preobrazhenskaya et al. 49 Pioneering studies on the development of methods for selective chemical modification of the unique macrolactone oligomycin A, a specific F 0 F 1 -ATP synthase inhibitor, and the original antitumour antibiotic olivomycin A of the aureolic acid group were performed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 402, "end": 403, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 762, "end": 764, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1140, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1388, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1537, "text": "20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1540, "text": "21", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1780, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2052, "text": "27", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2549, "text": "28,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2552, "text": "29", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2809, "end": 2812, "text": "40,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2815, "text": "41", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3290, "end": 3292, "text": "32", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3583, "end": 3585, "text": "52", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3878, "end": 3880, "text": "46", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4322, "end": 4324, "text": "49", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "In both cases, examples of chemical modifications of related compounds for these antibiotics are absent in the literature.

Chemical transformations of oligomycin A using different reagents were studied in detail. Alkaline hydrolysis reactions were performed and conditions for the selective reduction of double bonds and keto groups, cyclization, etc. were found. The replacement of the C(33)-hydroxyl group by the activated mesyl group has proved to be particularly successful. 55 This modification has no significant effect on biological activity of the antibiotic but provides a possibility to optimize its pharmacological properties. 65, 67 Only transformations via the biosynthesis were described for the aureolic acid group antibiotics mithramycin and chromomycin. 70, 76 These natural antibiotics, which have a limited use in the treatment of some malignant tumours, have attracted increasing attention of researchers in different fields. 71, 73 The synthesized compounds were tested for antiproliferative activity. Based on the results of in vitro studies of a series of new olivomycin A analogues of different types, compounds were selected for the in vivo evaluation. After preclinical trials in laboratory animals (evaluatrion of antitumour activity and toxicity), one olivomycin A analogue was recommended for further clinical trials. 87 \u00b1 89 A systemic approach applied to series of new semisynthetic analogues of olivomycin A allows a detailed study of the molecular mechanism of antitumour action of this antibiotic. 79 \u00b1 81 In particular, it was shown that olivomycin and its analogues, acting as DNA duplex minor groove ligands, can inhibit topoisomerase I and the Dnmt3a enzyme responsible for the disruption of the key epigenetic DNA methylation process. 79, 80 The structural fragments of olivomycin A critical for antitumour activity were identified. A model of the interaction of the antibiotic and some its analogues with the DNA duplex was proposed. 82 New analogues of anthracycline antibiotics with substituents of different types and different length, including those containing mono-and disaccharide residues, were prepared. The evaluation of the effect of polyhydroxylated moieties of doxorubicin and 14-hydroxycarminomycin on antitumour activity showed that this modification does not lead to the loss of activity of anthracyclines 93 \u00b1 95 and enhances inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I. 92 14-Hydroxycarminomycin derivatives proved to be particularly valuable because these compounds, as opposed to related doxorubicin derivatives, inhibit the proliferation of both doxorubicin-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant tumour cell lines. 96 A new water-soluble depot form of doxorubicin with the high-molecular-mass polysaccharide galactomannan DAVANAT was constructed and it was shown that it exhibits antiproliferative activity against three tumour cell lines. 94, 95 Series of new heliomycin analogues \u00d0 water-soluble salts of amino derivatives \u00d0 were synthesized and these compounds were shown to have high antiproliferative activity against many tumour cell lines and inhibitory activity against different targets. 100 The value of these studies is that the majority of aminomethyl derivatives of heliomycin are active against both wild-type and drugresistant cancer cells at micromolar or submicromolar concentrations. The method is protected by a patent. 101 Targeted chemical modifications of antibiotics are not only performed in order to prepare new potential drugs of a new generation but are used as an efficient tool for investigation of the mechanisms of action on bacterial or tumour cells.
