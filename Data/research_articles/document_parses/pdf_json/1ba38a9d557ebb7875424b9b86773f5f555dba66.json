            "text": "The rapid spread of the new coronavirus across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to the response capacity of hospitals at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.",

Similarly, it becomes paramount to identify which healthcare facilities are likely to face surges in demand due to the need to hospitalize severely ill patients. In this paper we combine traditional and novel accessibility metrics to address these questions. Using networkdistance metrics, we first estimate the number of vulnerable people living in areas with poor access to inpatient or outpatient facilities able to provide care for patients with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Next, we use a new balanced floating catchment area method (BFCA) proposed by (Paez, Higgins, & Vivona, 2019) to analyze levels of access to hospitals that could treat patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, taking into account healthcare system capacity and competition effects for ICU beds with mechanical ventilators.",

Furthermore, although overall the average number of intensive care units (ICU)beds with ventilators is 1.06 per 10 thousand inhabitants, there are large variations in this level of service, both between and within cities. In particular, we find that the accessibility to ICU resources is substantially lower in black and poor communities.

The affected person was a man from S\u00e3o Paulo who had travelled that month to Italy. This case was typical of the beginning of the epidemic in Brazil, with other early cases of the disease imported via international flights coming mostly from Italy and the United States (Candido et al., 2020) . At that early stage, the then-Minister of Health noted that it would remain to be seen how the virus behaved in a tropical country in the middle of summer. While there is evidence that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures (Paez et al., 2020) , it is now clear that the disease can be devastating during summer too: as early of July, less than five months after the first confirmed case of the COVID-19 in Brazil, over 1.8 million cases have been confirmed, and over 70 thousand deaths have been attributed to the disease, 45% of which concentrated in the 20 largest cities of the country. By early June, Brazil had become, after the United States, the country with the highest number of cases of COVID-19 in the world.",

In Brazil's mixed health care system, these segments of the population typically can afford to pay for healthcare or use health services intermediated by private health insurance. This is not the case for lower-income groups, who are largely dependent on the public health system in Brazil, and among whom community transmission rapidly increased the number of infections. This development is particularly worrisome as low-income groups in the country also typically live in less developed urban areas with poor transport services and poor access to health, education, and employment opportunities (Pereira, Braga, Serra, & Nadalin, 2019) . Previous research, in fact, has identified important spatial gaps in accessibility to emergency services in Brazil . To further complicate matters, other research has linked poor accessibility to higher pneumonia mortality (Zaman et al., 2014) .",

The work of Noronha et al.

They found that even in an optimistic scenario, of an infection level of 0.1% in the first month, roughly half of the nation's health regions would face a grave deficit of ICU beds to meet demand for admission of patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Similar regional modeling studies conducted by Coelho et al (2020) and Castro et al (2020) suggest the pressure on the health system is more likely to reach critical levels in large urban centers, where the number of confirmed cases is higher.",

Vulnerable population groups were defined as people above 50 years old with lower income (in the bottom half of the income distribution).

Another limitation is that we analyzed the attendance capacity of the public healthcare system focusing only on the number of adult ICU beds and ventilators. Other studies should also consider restrictions imposed by the availability of healthcare professionals to staff ICUs when the data is available. Another limitation of the method is that our analyses are restricted to the population and supply of services within cities. This generates two effects. The first is the tendency to underestimate the level of access to services by people who live near the border between two cities, since they could possibly access hospitals in the neighboring city. The second effect is the underestimation of the demand from people from other neighboring cities who can seek admission to hospitals in the 20 cities analyzed. To minimize this second problem, we applied an adjustment factor for hospital admissions by non-residents (Brasil, 2005) according to the size of the population living in each hexagon, as suggested by Paez et al. (2019) . A factor of 1.5, for example, would simulate that the size of the demand for admission to each hospital is 50% higher due to patients living in other cities. In a recent study, Servo, Andrade and Amaral (2019) demonstrated that in 2015 on average 30% of the hospitalizations for medium complexity treatments in cities was from patients living in other cities. Based on data from the SUS Hospital Information System for 2019, we calculated the value of the correction factors for each city (Table 1 ). Note that the .

Figures 1 to 4 present for four selected cities the size and living place of the low-income population older than 50 years who (A) cannot access any primary healthcare establishment in less than 30 minutes by walking; and (B) live more than 5 Km from the nearest hospital with at least one ICU bed and one ventilator. For the sake of brevity, we only present the maps for Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza and Manaus, the 4 cities most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil. As of the end of June, these four cities alone concentrated 18% of COVID-19 confirmed cases and 32% of deaths in the country. These maps show that vulnerable populations with poor access to health services are mostly located in urban peripheries, indicating those areas which would be good candidates for local policy interventions, such as setting up field hospitals or engaging pre-hospital mobile units (such as the Urgent Mobile Response Service -SAMU) or community health agents.",

The maps on Panel A show the spatial distribution of hospitals, where each hospital is represented by a circle whose size reflects the ratio between the number of beds/ventilators of that hospital and the population of its catchment area. Although the situations vary across cities, as a rule, downtown areas generally concentrate the greatest number of hospitals, especially the ones with more beds per inhabitant. This is the case for example in Fortaleza, Manaus and Rio de Janeiro. The availability of ICU beds and ventilators to serve patients with severe COVID-19 tends to be considerably lower in the peripheral regions of these cities. In these regions, it is common to observe ratios of ICU beds per 10 thousand inhabitants persons. This translates into 9.76e-6 beds per person, compared to 8.74e-5 beds per person average for S\u00e3o Paulo. This shows how the regional PPR can be misleading, by assuming that every person in the region has equal access to medical facilities. Analysis using the BFCA indicator also illustrates how living close to a hospital does not necessarily translate into high levels of accessibility, once congestion effects are taken into account.

Final remarks This paper examined the geographical access to COVID-19 healthcare in the 20 largest Brazilian cities, looking at both healthcare facilities with capacity for triage and referral of patients with suspected COVID-19 infections to hospitals, as well as those able to treat patients in serious condition through the support of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators. We mapped approximately 230 thousand vulnerable people (low-income above 50 years old) living more than 30 minutes walking from a public healthcare facility able to test for COVID-19 or refer suspected cases to hospitals. Our results also indicate that some 1.6 million vulnerable people live farther than 5 Km from a hospital with capacity for ICU admission. Because patients suspected with COVID-19 might face mobility constraints due to grave conditions, it becomes crucial to develop strategies for provision of transport and health services to these people. This is particularly true of lowincome people living on the outskirts of cities, where there are fewer mobility options and where health services are scarcer.",

We find that thirteen out of the 20 cities analyzed have fewer ICU beds with ventilators than the minimum level recommended by the Health Ministry, which could be insufficient to deal with large growth of demand for hospital admissions in the most optimistic scenarios of COVID-19 propagation in Brazil. Accessibility analysis using the new balanced float catchment area (BFCA) shows this scenario is particularly worrisome when we account for competition effects on both supply and demand for health services. The BFCA estimates show substantially lower access to health services in low-income and black communities in urban peripheries, which generally face scarcer supply of health equipment and could more easily be overwhelmed by the near-future hospitalization demands.",

The reduction of transportation services without a coordinated restriction of other activities causes longer waiting periods, and can consequently increase the agglomeration of people at transport stations and crowding aboard vehicles, aggravating dissemination of the virus. In this respect, it is important for local managers to reorganize the public transit service to assure better access to healthcare facilities. This could include provision of exclusive services to healthcare professionals and providers of other essential services, without impairing the supply of services of regular lines.",

These ratios can be considered critical against a backdrop of an epidemic with growing numbers of patients needing hospitalization for respiratory complications. The example of cities like Rio de Janeiro also illustrate how setting up field hospitals in farther areas can increase the capillarity of health services in epidemic situations like the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, the maps on Panel B show the number of ICU beds and ventilators accessible from each location considering at the same time the level of service availability and the potential overlap of demand and supply competition effects estimated with the balanced float catchment area (BFCA). Compared to the results in Panel A, these maps present in more detail how the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare is particularly higher in central urban areas. This is perhaps more clearly seen in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, where accessibility to equipped beds steadily declines from the central parts of the city to the periphery. Considering the average population per tile of the hexagonal grid in S\u00e3o Paulo, this indicates that in the regions with the highest accessibility, there are approximately 0.000012 beds per 10,000 people serving on average 1,240",
