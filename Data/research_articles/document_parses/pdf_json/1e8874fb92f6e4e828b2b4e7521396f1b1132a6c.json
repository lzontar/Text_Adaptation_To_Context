Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir.",

For RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) presents an optimal target due to its crucial role in RNA synthesis, lack of host homolog and high sequence and structural conservation. The RdRp remains the target of choice for the treatment of several viral diseases, including chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus infection. Arguably the most promising, broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs).",

These NAs are unable to be recognized as 'regular' Watson-Crick nucleobases during subsequent rounds of RNA synthesis from the NAcontaining template. This results in an increase in mutations and ultimately leads to non-viable genomes, a process known as 'lethal mutagenesis' 5 . Ribavirin (Rbv) and Favipiravir 6 belong to this class of antivirals, and are active against a variety of viruses (eg., HCV, influenza virus, Ebola virus).",

Using the SARS-CoV nsp12 cryo-EM structure (PDB 6NUR), we built a model by stacking nsp12 onto a set of related RdRps described by Peersen 27 and used the T7 RNA polymerase ternary complex 28 to position both RNA and the incoming NTP.

Overall, the structure is similar to that of the poliovirus polymerase: Motifs A-G encircle and constitute the polymerase active site, with an open NTP entry tunnel leading to the catalytic center ( Fig. 2A) . In CoV nsp12, motifs A,B,C,D and F the most conserved, and this conservation extends to Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae families 29 : it is thus reasonable to extrapolate that the mechanism of action is similar to that of other viral RdRps, and in particular to Picornaviridae with which CoVs share the \"small thumb\" feature 27 .",

The phenyl ring is orientated towards hydrophobic residues from the palm (V637, L638) and the fingers (I579, V693), and plays a structural role in tightening the two domains by a strong mesh of hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, residue V557 is located at the end of motif F on the second strand forming the side of the RNA template entry channel (Fig. 3A) . Based on the theoretical model derived from the poliovirus polymerase elongation complex (4K4S) 31 , it can be predicted that the valine side chain faces the template RNA and interacts with the base to be paired with the incoming NTP.

The structure of motif B is considered loose, but its conformational change upon binding the NTP is considered as a fidelity check point of viral RdRps 33 .

In other words, if the pseudo-adenine basepairs properly, the \u03b1-phosphate would be pushed away and unaligned for catalysis with the metal ions.

Furthermore, while a nucleotidylation activity has been defined for the small-genome arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) 25 , the exact role of the NiRAN domain in the Nidovirus viral life-cycle is unknown.

To accommodate this structurally, the ribose would have to move away from its canonical position and towards the catalytic ions. Due to the small size of the catalytic cavity, this would generate in turn a displacement on the catalytic ions from the active site, as shown for a similar two-metal ion catalysis ExoN reaction where any slight modification in ion position or distortion leads to inhibition of the reaction40 . Better structurally defined nsp14:RNA complexes are needed to fully understand the structural requirements of 3'-terminal nucleotides for ExoN-mediated removal. Of note, the engineered MHV V553I RdRp mutant was found to be inextricably linked with ExoN activity, i.e. the fidelity effect could only be detected in ExoN deficient virus23 . Importantly, as is the case for Rbv, the ExoN of CoV may be able to recognise and excise incorporated GS 441524-MP, as shown by the increased potency against ExoN deficient viruses 21 .However, unlike other Rbv and 5-FU, Remdesivir is active on WT, and ExoN(-) mutants show only modest 4.5 fold increase in sensitivity to Remdesivir, indicating that inhibition likely originates by a mixed effect balanced between incorporation and excision.The increased efficiency of Remdesivir relative to other NAs indicates that its metabolite GS 441524-TP must be incorporated by the polymerase at a level superior to that of the excision rate of the GS 441524-MP by the ExoN, and/or be less accessible or removed less-efficiently by the ExoN. In contrast, while Rbv-TP also appears to be efficiently incorporated into the nascent RNA by the RdRp, it is likely to be excised just as efficiently by the ExoN.CoV RdRps are able to accommodate a wide variety of different chemical modifications of NAs (e.g., on the ribose, on the base, on both)30 . The ability of the ExoN domain to recognise these diverse modifications should therefore be taken into consideration, and represents a potential avenue which could be exploited for NA drug development. Studies which analyse the difference in recognition, incorporation of GS 441524 5'-TP and excision of GS 441524-MP compared to other NA-TPs by the CoV RdRp, ExoN and other replication machinery will provide crucial insights into proper design of novel NAs.

NAs incorporated into RNA can be removed by the CoV exonuclease (ExoN) residing in the N-terminal domain of nsp14[12][13][14] .
