The concept of \"critical transitions\" has been an invisible aspect of daily care in the NICU and has not been well studied, though some data suggest that poor transitions contribute to suboptimal outcomes. For example, studies have shown that poorly executed transitions of care at the time of discharge home can lead to increased length of stay, higher post-discharge healthcare utilization, and increased costs [28, 29] . Poor transitions likely also contribute to family dissatisfaction. A small qualitative study reported parents feeling distressed by the transfer of an infant to the NICU after birth and by the length of time they were separated from their infant and that even the transition from high-intensive to low-dependency care within the NICU is frightening for parents [30] . With respect to handoffs in the NICU, a recent study examining the impact of neonatologist continuity of care on short-term patient outcomes did not show any association between the number of neonatologist transitions and ventilator duration, oxygen use, blood stream infection, or urinary tract infections; however, similar to our results, they found that transitions were strikingly frequent [31] . We hypothesize that by focusing on implementation of evidence-based potentially better practices related to communication, teamwork, family integration, and standardization during transitions, we will be able to improve many of these important outcomes such as LOS, post-discharge healthcare utilization, family satisfaction, as well as key clinical outcomes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1073, "end": 1077, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1081, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1449, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1850, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study is the first to describe and characterize NICU transitions using an action-oriented, improvement-focused logic model (key driver diagram).

The current shift in focus, emphasizing smaller, but more frequent transitions of care represents an entirely new and fertile horizon for QI initiatives. The Joint Commission, Institute of Medicine and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality have challenged hospitals to improve the effectiveness of transitions, with much of the current focus on the care of adults [15, 34, 35] . The opportunities for improvement uncovered in the baseline VON audit serve as a call to action to focus NICU QI efforts in this area.

First, this was a cross-sectional structured assessment taking place in 95 units on 1 day in a 2-week period. Therefore, assessments of patient-level care practices are limited by day-to-day variability in census, care providers, and patient acuity. In addition, the unit-level measures rely on self-report of the existence of policies, procedures, and guidelines, which may not reflect the actual existence of policies and guidelines, the quality of these policies, or compliance with these guidelines in practice. Sampling strategies for the patient-level audit varied among sites and may have affected our estimates of transition frequencies. The audit tool has not been validated and the assignment of questions to each of the four key drivers of the conceptual model was performed by the authors without formal psychometric testing. Therefore, it is possible that items we assigned to a construct (e.g., teamwork, communication, family integration), may in fact, be measuring something else or have overlap with other constructs. However, the authors feel that the assignment of items to these constructs (Supplementary Table 3 ) has face validity and is appropriate for such an exploratory analysis. The audit tool was designed with efficiency of large-scale implementation in mind, and was not intended to comprehensively measure all NICU transitions or to measure all types of transitions (changes in care team, site of care, or status/ plan of care) equally. In particular, policies and procedures related to changes in care team were addressed with the fewest items. However, the gaps between evidence and practice seen across audited transitions are likely to also be present in the other types of transitions.
