Second, our infectious disease clinicians ensured that suspect cases were assessed thoroughly before ruling out MERS-CoV infection, with many being tested for influenza and other possible aetiological agents (e.g. S. pneumoniae).

Moreover, while Hajj pilgrims are advised to be vaccinated against influenza and pneumococcal disease, the administration of these vaccines is highly variable, and only the mandatory meningococcal vaccine is routinely administered to pilgrims. There is no structured programme to vaccinate this population although the vaccines are widely available at polyclinics, private general practitioner clinics, and travel clinics at private and restructured hospitals. Healthcare providers should be educated on the importance of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for Hajj pilgrims in order to advocate them when providing meningococcal vaccination to pilgrims. This study has several limitations. Data collection for patients was mainly for surveillance purposes, and not all clinical information was readily accessible. Furthermore, we may have underestimated the rates of influenza vaccination, as the data collected for this study did not include vaccinations given to the Singapore residents at other healthcare institutions, and vaccination history may not have been welldocumented for non-residents.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 549, "end": 552, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In conclusion, our study reflects the experience of our institution in carrying out enhanced surveillance for MERS-CoV.
