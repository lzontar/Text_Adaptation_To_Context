            "text": "This paper argues that the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 constituted the first Anthropocenic war: as an anthropogenic virus and biological attack on the human body and as the first global pandemic requiring a truly global response since our recognition of the Anthropocene. The paper explores how each nation was forced by the virus into a pause of global connections and relationships and a war against the human body, with the 'total demobilization' and bunkerization of their domestic populations. With space cut-off, this became a war of time and of endurance, with relations reduced, as Virilio suggests, to those of the connected 'terminal citizen'. Beyond the civil war against the body, however, there was also the civil war within the domestic populations who were active participants in this imploded home front line, producing and sharing both feel-good and disciplinary propaganda and engaging in debates around politics, conspiracy theories and disinformation. The paper explores the problems governments face in remobilization, the new data regime of informational totalitarianism remobilization will help produce and the likely instability of the post-covid-19 international order. It concludes that this 'war' was only the beginning and that anthropogenic environmental factors will play an increasing role in human conflicts in coming years.",

            "text": "From this moment until that in which the enemy shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic, all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the service of the armies. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothing and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the aged shall betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic. (Halsall 2020) This call for mass conscription (literally, a 'mass uprising') would transform the French military, replacing the professional army within the year with a vast, national army of 800,000 trained soldiers made up of citizens. But the lev\u00e9e meant more than the creation of a mass army, being built on two key ideas. The first was a new relationship to the state, with an implicit post-revolutionary compact whereby all those united and protected as citizens owed a similar duty of protection to the state: from now on, the body of the citizen was intimately tied to the survival of the body politic. The second, following from this, was that the entire society would be mobilized to support the military. As Ernst Junger notes here, 'the image of war as armed combat merges into the more extended image of a gigantic labour process': now the military army is joined by-and to-'the modern armies' of commerce, transport, foodstuff and munitions, until 'there is no longer any movement whatsoever-be it that of the homeworker at her sewing machine-without at least indirect use for the battlefield' (Junger 1991, 126) .",

WWI saw the fruition of these processes, with the mass mobilization of populations for mass warfare, supported by the mass mobilization of home industries. For some, this mobilization was insufficient. In his 1930 essay 'Total Mobilization', Ernst Junger complained of Germany's only 'partial' mobilization (1991, 125) . For revolutionary conservatives like Junger, true greatness required a 'total mobilization' with its 'unlimited marshalling of potential energies', a mobilization 'that requires extension to the deepest marrow ' (1991, 126) . This mobilization was itself a reflection of the kinetic rhythms of the machine age:",

With a pleasure-tinged horror, we sense that here, not a single atom is not in motion-that we are profoundly inscribed in this raging process. Total mobilization is far less consummated than it consummates itself; in war and peace, it expresses the secret and inexorable claim to which our life in the age of masses and machines subjects us. (1991, 128) The totally mobilized peace of modernity, therefore, prefigured and produced the total mobilization of modern war. Junger's hopes for a new German youth who would throw themselves into this project of renewal-through-mobilization soon found its expression in Nazism's blitzkrieg and the 'total mobilization' of WWII that definitively erased the difference between civilian life and military action.",

By the time of the 1991 Gulf War, smaller, professional armies dominated again, defined now by their total mobilization not of men, but of technologies. By then, war itself was in crisis in the west, with questions being asked as to whether western societies could sustain casualties and still support military action. The solution was a new phase in the history of mobilization. With the military and media collaborating in the Gulf to produce and disseminate the global spectacle, domestic populations would now be mobilized as its audience. In this new lev\u00e9e-en-masse-medias, the public's role was to watch television: to consume the war, to follow the press briefings, marvel at the 'smart-bomb' footage and 'clean war' and applaud the military operation.",

A Steve Bell cartoon of the time showed a penguin grandfather replying to his grandchild's question of what he did in the war with, 'Me? I watched television and I'm proud of it!' (Merrin 2019, 24) . It was a model of war and mass-media mobilization that would dominate in the west in the following decades, through Kosovo in 1999 , Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 , albeit one increasingly left behind as the 'War on Terror' developed. With the move to unseen drone strikes and special-forces operations, it was better if no-one knew what was happening; hence, the public were effectively stood down. That demobilization would last until the 2020 covid-19 lockdown which inaugurated a new era of total demobilization.",

Xi Jinping vowed to wage a 'people's war' on the virus; in a speech on 16 March, Emmanuel Macron repeatedly declared France was 'at war'; on 17 March, Italy's special commissioner for the coronavirus emergency called for a 'war-time economy'; on 18 March, Donald Trump presented himself as a 'wartime president'; in his 23 March address to the nation, UK PM Boris Johnson told the public this was 'a fight' in which 'every one of us is directly enlisted', whilst on 6 April, the US surgeon general warned of the 'Pearl Harbour moment' coming for this generation (see Serhan 2020; Momtaz 2020; Woodward 2020). Of course, as many equally quickly pointed out, 'war' metaphors were neither accurate or helpful, as war is a purely human phenomenon, representing a clash of wills, to which a human solution is always possible, whilst the victims' deaths did not represent a personal failure to fight (Serhan 2020 ). Freedman notes all this but nevertheless suggests 'there are similarities between pandemics and war, especially if a realistic view of modern war is adopted' in terms of effects and governmental responses (Freedman 2020) . But perhaps we can go even further? Perhaps our concept of 'war' itself needs redefining: perhaps, biologically, this is a war?",

We have long known that humans have transformed the world and have done so since huntergathering times, but recent decades have seen a growing awareness that the scale and speed of human transformation has exponentially increased. Though the concept of the Anthropocene remains controversial, with disagreements as to what geological records to accept and when the Anthropocene began (with the mid-twentieth century being seen by many as a key moment), the broader trends it identifies in climate change, systemic pollution, the transformation of habitats and ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity are beyond dispute.",

Conflict shifted instead into posturing and soft power, from Trump's insistence on calling it the 'Chinese virus' and attacks on the WHO as pro-Chinese (Al Jazeera 2020; Shear 2020), to China's post-lockdown reframing of themselves as benevolent global providers of PPE (The Economist 2020).",

A system defined by motion-by the hypercirculation of goods, commodities, people, money, data and communications-was fundamentally interrupted, slowed down and even paused, forced in its extremes into idleness, into furlough, even hyperredundancy. The whole remained in motion, but with its systems disrupted-with employment and consumption locked-downit lacked both its meaning and the means to complete its circuits.",

Crucially, the cause of that crash was not simply the lack of demand but the immobility of the oil itself, as places to store the oversupply ran out.

Indeed, war's violence is, first of all, the violence of movement itselfthe speed of assault-recall, again, Sun Tzu: 'The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll stones along in its course' (Sun Tzu 2020, Ch.5, part 12). War, therefore, is the rapid transferral of bodies and energies from one point in space and time to another point already occupied by other bodies, with the aim of displacing or destroying them. It is a kinetic phenomenon with the destructive force and character of a projectile: one that begins and ends with movement, with mobilization and demobilization.",

In a reversal of the lev\u00e9e-en-masse and of Junger's call for 'total mobilization', this global, specieswide world war produced instead the total demobilization of the population. The essence of war reverses here from speed into immobility and inertia. Whereas, in modern societies, Junger suggests 'not a single atom is not in motion', ours immediately dedicated itself to eradicating it. If, for Virilio, the speed of contemporary weapons technologies brings an advantage over the enemy, in allowing us 'to gain fractions of seconds ' (1986, 137) , this was a war that worked in the opposite direction, with demobilization hoping to gain weeks, even months, worth of advantage. Whereas Marinetti proclaimed that the Futurists would glorify war, describing it as 'the world's only hygiene' (Marinetti 2009, 22) , here the proto-Fascists desire to destroy human life reversed into a new defence of the human against covid-19: for today, for the period of viral infection, hygiene became the world's only war.",

This was the apocalypse as a dull Sunday afternoon-as Alan Partridge's famous appeal to the heavens: 'Sunday, bloody Sunday!' (Brand 2014) . For Virilio, when WWI ended as a war of space-as a war of movement-bogged down in the stalemate of the trenches, it became instead a 'war of attrition', a war of time, where 'duration was survival ' (1986, 52-53;56) . This was our fate too. With the lockdown closing down space and movement, this world war was turned into a war of time with duration again representing survival. To live meant to bunkerdown: to cut oneself off from space and survive time. Life was reduced to endurance, and especially to the endurance of oneself.",

Whole nations immediately transformed themselves into carceral societies-or rather, in our compliance, into self-incarcerated societies.

This stopping is traditionally a punishment, as the arrested person is imprisoned and refused space to move, whilst motionlessness has also been used as torture-central to the 'enhanced interrogation techniques' used against Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, for example, were 'stress positions', handcuffing people into painful, prolonged immobility. Here, therefore, we put ourselves under house arrest: we stopped ourselves, locked ourselves in and placed ourselves into stress positions, torturing the public body for weeks with enforced immobility. Or perhaps this was more medieval in tone-responding to the plague-like, miasmic threat with a self-siege warfare, with each individual retreating behind their walls to hold out with their stores?",

Sloterdijk's 2002 book Terror From the Air explores the movement in the twentieth century from targeting the body to targeting the environment and the new 'military climatology' that resulted (Sloterdijk 2009, 19) . Following Heidegger, he emphasizes how our 'Being-in-the-world' was always a 'Being-in-the-air or more exactly a Being-in-the-breathable' (2009, 48) , tracing how chemical warfare, Nazi gas chambers and nuclear weapons created an 'unliveable milieu ' (2009, 16) , devastating the 'life world ' (2009, 55) . For Virilio, similarly, the 'new climactic reality' of environmental warfare and bombardment in WWII led, in response, to the discovery of the 'bunker form'-our new 'survival machines' (Virilio 1994, 39) . 'Just as there are two times, the time of peace and the time of declared war', Virilio argues, 'there are two atmospheres and not just one': those we can breathe in and those which kill us (1994, 42) . Hence, bunkers became 'a shelter for man in this critical period, the place where he buries himself to subsist ' (1994, 46) . So, in this lockdown, the terror from the air became a terror of the air, and military bunker architecture was democratized and generalized to all, as we locked ourselves in our 'casement' (literally, a 'stronghouse') (1994, 46) . Being-in-the-world became Being-inthe-bunker, with Sloterdijk's claim that 'we are condemned to being-in \u2026' describing now not only the fatality of phenomenological reality, but the fate of the body within an unbreathable world.",

Covid-19 had a curiously similar effect: the explosion of this enhanced biological weapon and our desperate bunkerization showing us a world without us in it. Stories spread of the environment's recovery-the reduction in industrial emissions (Regan 2020) and animals reclaiming the world-and a new photographic-essay genre emerged of covid-19-emptied cities (Liubchenkova 2020; Manning 2020 ; The Guardian 2020).

(1997, (10) (11) It is hard to read this without thinking of our lockdown in an isolated, hyperextended present, disconnected from the real experience of time and space and engaging through real-time interfaces. For Virilio, this loss of the terrestrial body has another, theological meaning: as the loss of motion ('anima'-the root of 'animation') is also the loss of our soul (Latin: 'anima') (1997, 25) . Hence, the body terminal, in only being 'mobile on the spot ' (1997, 20) , is fundamentally a terminal body.",

From adolescence to retirement each twenty-four hour cycle repeats the same shattering bombardment \u2026 (Vaneigem 1994, 52) Against this bombardment, Vaneigem hymned the 'rage to live', but covid-19 perhaps exposed these dreams. Though some spent their time refining their craft skills, for most the experience of liberation from both the division of labour and consumerist leisure owed more to Blaise Pascal's 1670 claim that 'All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone' (Pascal 1995, 37) .

But the civil war also had an important, on-the-ground reality. Virilio's theory of 'dromocracy' (of governments of speed) suggests different speed classes-different 'orders of speed' (1986, 119)exist: hence, the lockdown class division between those who did not have to move and those who did: the health and care workers, delivery drivers, and warehouse and retail workers who faced the risk of exposure and death; and hence, the division too between those for whom money continued to move into their accounts and those for whom it stopped.",

The UK government especially waged a war on the vulnerable, preparing for the expected surge in hospital demand by mass evacuating the ill and weak back into their homes with little or no care, or into care homes, which became centres of infection. For weeks, the protection of care workers and rising number of care-home deaths were ignored, with the latter left out of official hospital-death figures (BBC 2020e). Add to this, the problems of the elderly, ill or vulnerable getting supplies; the rise in mental-health problems including self-harm and suicide (Mills 2020; Mohdin 2020) ; families going hungry (Iqbal 2020); a rise in domestic violence (Graham-Harrison et al. 2020) ; lockdown murders; the digital divide of those without adequate Internet access (Kelly 2020) ; the rise in problem-drinking (Campbell 2020); a rise in online child exploitation and child abuse imagery (Solon 2020) ; increased online videos of abuse and nonconsensual sex (Grant 2020) ; and an increase in cybercrime with new, covid-19-related scams (UK Government 2020b).

Ongoing antilockdown protests, encouraged by Trump, were increasingly dominated by far-right militia groups and conspiracists, prompting fears of serious political violence (Perkins 2020) . Whilst Trump's critics saw his handling of the crisis as a disaster, in fact he was playing to his strengths. What Trump achieved was to transform the covid-19 civil war into an extension of his already successful political and cultural civil war against the American people and its democratic institutions.

By the time covid-19 hit, the Internet was seen as an out-of-control 'toxic' realm of trolling, abuse, death threats, hate speech, political extremism, populism, Russian hacking, information warfare and disinformation, 'fake news', electoral manipulation by paid, targeted advertising, cybercrime, government surveillance and mass-harvested personal data with few privacy protections. Almost overnight, this reversed again, with the real world and human relations becoming toxic and the Internet being transformed into our saviour, allowing safe work, education, entertainment and communication. Within weeks, we became, like the cell-bound inhabitants of Forster's tale, afraid of human contact. The outside world was no longer a site of possible risk, but instead was absolutely impure. 'The sacred', Caillois writes, 'is always more or less \"what one cannot approach without dying\" ' (2001, 21) , and this was how we now treated life. The arbitrary 2 m distancing was treated as a meeting point between the safe, profane and the sacred world of contagion, impurity and death: to get close to another was not simply a risk, it was a passage between orders of being.",

In the UK, the relaxation of restrictions was confusing and the suggestion that some could return to work emphasized the reality of speed classes, with middle classes more able to remain at home, teleworking, whilst the working classes had to take their chances with public transport and work (Jones 2020) . Despite the most effective model of remobilization being the labour-intensive process of mass testing, contact tracing and isolation, many nations preferred technological solutionism, embracing the continuous controls of digital surveillance, with electronic tagging replacing house arrest. China pioneered this approach, as a logical extension of their massive, near-ubiquitous surveillance system deployed against the Uighurs in Xinjiang (Wall Street Journal 2017; Byler 2019) and the 'social credit' systems and facial-recognition cameras used against their domestic populations (Mistreanu 2018; Dudley 2020) . Here, CCTV facial recognition, drones, QR codes, location tracking by telecoms and technology companies and voluntary or mandatory apps formed a network of sensors enmeshing individuals in exactly that city-wide 'control-mechanism' Guattari foresaw. The same systems were widely adopted beyond China, highlighting an underlying trend within global political systems: the movement of all governments towards informational totalitarianism.",

Stripped of its politico-aesthetics and aided by the rise of digital technology, it reverses now from spectacle to secrecy and from public to private, to silently access, monitor and evaluate every aspect of personal interiority and singularity.",

It is freed here not only from the burden of terror, the manpower of policing and the cost of costumery, but, most importantly, from ties to any political system or ideology, existing simply as the technocratic aim and result of digital systems. Today, therefore, even western liberal democracies are informationally totalitarian, in their mass surveillance, their treatment of personal data and their systems of monitoring and control, in their desire-no different to that of authoritarian regimes-to access everything and their absolute conviction that they have the right to do so. Once again, this is for our benefit-what was once for our 'security' is now for 'public health'-but it nevertheless remains an internal attack on the data integrity of the state's own citizens. The US and UK governments had joked about this, archly naming two of their spy programmes, 'Bullrun' and 'Edgehill', after Civil War battles (Ball et al. 2013) . That data civil war against private data has continued without a pause since Snowden's revelations, and it is likely that the advances allowed by the covid-19 crisis will never be rolled back.",

As Naomi Klein argues, 'the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent-and highly profitable-no-touch future'. It is a future 'in which our homes are never again exclusively personal spaces, but are also, via high-speed digital connectivity, our schools, our doctor's offices, our gyms, and, if determined by the state, our jails' (Klein 2020) .

We can expect to see the post-covid-19 explosion, therefore, of drones, surrogate robotics and autonomous systems, all controlled from remote shipping containers or box-room bunkers. This will be a new phase of clean war, defined now not by the absence of civilian casualties but by the hand sanitizer available for the next shift of pilots and the plastic screen between them and the camera and weapons operators.

Actually, bacteria were not the smallest things-it would take years before the much smaller viruses were discovered-but Wells was correct about our hubris. Although in his 'scientific romance' these bacteria were our 'microscopic allies', we failed, in the subsequent years, to take seriously the threat of these microbial forces.
