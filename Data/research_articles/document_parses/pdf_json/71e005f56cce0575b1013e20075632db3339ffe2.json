However, despite vulnerability to poorer outcomes, disaster preparedness for individuals with SCI is inadequate. Telemedicine has been effectively used to mitigate the impact of natural disasters. In this case study, we describe the provision of clinical care, via telemedicine, to an individual with SCI who was affected by the California Valley Fire in 2015. Case presentation The individual described was an adult who sustained a SCI. Before discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation, they enrolled in a research study, through which they received outpatient SCI-specific care via telemedicine (teleSCI). The participant attended several teleSCI visits prior to the start of the Valley Fire. In the midst and immediate aftermath of prolonged wildfire, and despite experiencing significant personal loss as a result of the fire, the participant continued to receive teleSCI services. TeleSCI was used to address emergent and extant medical concerns and to facilitate replacement of medical supplies and equipment destroyed by fire. Discussion TeleSCI was used to provide continuity of care and was responsive to the needs of an individual with SCI severely affected by wildfire. Emergency preparedness that meets the needs of persons with disabilities is critical during times of crisis. Telemedicine may be an effective tool that can be applied to meet the medical needs of individuals with SCI and to mitigate the impact of disasters.",

For instance, the majority of US individuals with SCI rely on wheelchairs or scooters; however, natural disasters typically result in greater mobility challenges such that individuals with SCI may experience difficulties with evacuation, transportation, and access to customized living quarters [14, 15] . Furthermore, disasters may result in disruptions to receiving healthcare. Given the high degree of psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder) among individuals with SCI and their unique physical health concerns (e.g., spasticity and chronic pain), the stress and disruption caused by natural disasters may exacerbate physical and mental health conditions among individuals with SCI [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, despite vulnerability to poorer outcomes in the context of natural disasters, studies examining disaster preparedness among individuals with SCI and other disabilities suggest inadequate planning and a lack of specific strategies for evacuation, survival, and care needs [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

Indeed, telemedicine has been used to provide care and to support relief efforts during disaster situations [28, 29] .

The individual with SCI also followed an intermittent catheterization program for bladder management and a bowel management program consisting of laxatives and stool softeners with digital stimulation and evacuation. Prior to returning to their private residence in the north central portion of California, a significant distance away from SCVMC, they enrolled in a telemedicine for SCI (teleSCI) study (SCiPad; Craig H. Neilsen Foundation Quality of Life Grant #296161), through which they received remote SCI-specific care from a board-certified SCI specialist. As part of the study, the participant received a tablet (Apple iPad Air) with a 6-month cellular data plan as well as a home blood pressure machine for selfmonitoring [31, 32] . The participant's teleSCI visits were completed through the FaceTime application. FaceTime uses end-to-end encryption to prevent interception and decryption of data while in transit between devices, satisfying the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards for the protection of electronic health information [33] . TeleSCI visits with the physician were able to be scheduled within a day of request and a program coordinator, who was available to all participants for nonemergency needs during regular business hours, liaised between the participant and the physician outside of scheduled appointments. All applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers were followed during the SCiPad study.",

Furthermore, the participant reported that although they still had their manual wheelchair, most of their supplies and durable medical equipment (DME), including commode/shower bench, electric compression devices, standing frame, and equipment for home exercise were lost. Thus, the participant's new medical needs at that time were to replace essential DME and supplies; these were immediately ordered and promptly authorized by the participant's insurance.

As illustrated by this case example, when individuals with SCI experience a natural disaster, they may also face the loss of DMEs, supplies, and medications they routinely use, resulting in poorer health outcomes. Furthermore, their caregivers and their primary care providers, who live and practice in the same area, may also be affected by the disaster; thus, individuals with SCI may be unable to access and receive adequate or expeditious care. Given additional hurdles experienced by individuals with SCI, teleSCI, as an adjunct to other disaster relief services, may provide a means of delivering timely and convenient care and may facilitate swifter replacement of necessary equipment and supplies.",

In particular, recommendations suggest establishing infrastructure for telemedicine programs, principally in areas that are at high risk for disasters, so that when emergency situations are encountered, existing telemedicine networks can be used [45] . Indeed, reviews of several natural disasters suggest that instituting telemedicine capabilities after a disaster, rather than using extant infrastructure in response to disasters, is costly and may delay the provision of care [28, 29, 45] . A good example of the benefits of co-opting existing telemedicine programs during disasters is provided by the University of Texas Medical Branch's response to Hurricane Ike in 2008. Although Hurricane Ike resulted in significant disruptions to the medical center's operations, telemedicine services resumed significantly earlier and at higher levels than in-person care in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane [46] . Moreover, in another example, following a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in Pakistan in 2005, mobilization of resources at Rawalpindi's telemedicine training programs ameliorated effects of the disaster by enabling communications between affected rural clinics and preventing clinics from becoming overwhelmed [28, 47] . In our case example, an existing telemedicine service was used to provide timely and responsive care to an individual impacted by the Valley Fire within days of the start of the wildfire and before it was contained.",

Indeed, the need for telemedicine and its wider integration into healthcare systems has become even more salient following the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [48] . As a result of COVID-19's high transmissibility, recommendations were made to limit in-person clinic visits and to find alternatives to face-face encounters, including using telemedicine for visits [49] . However, changes to reimbursement structures had to be made to accommodate the rapid shift to telemedicine services. In particular, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services temporarily expanded Medicare reimbursement to allow healthcare seekers to receive telemedicine services regardless of their location. Prior to this, Medicare reimbursed telemedicine only in limited circumstances (e.g., when healthcare seekers resided in a designated rural area and when they received telemedicine services at a medical facility) [50] . Although the use of telemedicine has grown rapidly in recent years, a combination of a number of barriers, including limited financial reimbursement, have resulted in its relatively slow uptake nationally [51] [52] [53] .",
