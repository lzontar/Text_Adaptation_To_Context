Then they may search Zhejiang internet hospital platform (in Chinese), and choose an online consultation or internet phone consultation. Patients are able to upload their medical records, which can only be seen by the consulting doctor. It is a great comfort to patients with chronic diseases to access professional advice and get free assessment. There are also online lectures and articles about health education to help prevent any relapse in chronic mental patients. These resources guide citizens on how to relax at home, for example, they may use the knowledge gained from respiratory training and meditation. Aerobic exercise programs, for example, jogging, swimming, badminton, are recommended as they can help relieve adverse emotions. If conditions are restricted, leg raises, squats, push-ups, and abdominal exercises are also helpful.",

Strategies such as (1) guide the public to recognize the epidemic correctly. Do not exaggerate the consequences. (2) Psychological reactions such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and obsession may occur during the outbreak and how to respond to these reactions. (3) Keep up social connections. Chatting and communicating with family, friends, and co-workers through the use of phone or internet. To some individuals, pets can soothe emotions. Some patients may be satisfied with online consultation, while others may not. To those who really need psychopharmacological treatment for their mental illness, we suggest such patients who are living near the Hangzhou Seventh People's Hospital to come to the hospital at their earliest convenience. Despite the potent infectiousness, the tendency of COVID-19 is possible to be inhibited. Newly ascertained cases are decreasing in numbers daily, which means the Chinese government measures have been extremely effective. However, mental health care is urgently needed [7] , especially for medical workers who faced extreme risk of becoming infected and high-pressure work caused by rescuing severely ill patients [8] . As for the current situation, networking of medical treatments is playing an important role in the development of medicines. Thus, online mental services should be further developed to help maintain support of mentally ill patients in major public health events like COVID-19.",
