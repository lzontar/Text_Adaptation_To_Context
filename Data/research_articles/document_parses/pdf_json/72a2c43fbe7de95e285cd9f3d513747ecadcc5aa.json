Here, we present a fatal case of HLH secondary to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection complicated by both anti-viral drug resistance and sepsis from multiple MDROs including pandrug-resistant superbug bacteria. Case presentation: A previously healthy, six-year-old boy presented with a 45-day history of fever prior to a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and hemorrhagic colitis, both associated with CMV. On hospital admission, the patient was found to be colonized with multiple, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carbapenamase-producing organisms (CPO). He eventually developed respiratory, urine and bloodstream infections with highly drug-resistant, including pandrug-resistant bacteria, which could not be controlled by antibiotic treatment. Antiviral therapy also failed to contain his CMV infection and the patient succumbed to overwhelming bacterial and viral infection. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the MDR bacteria and metagenomic analysis of his blood sample revealed an unusual accumulation of a wide range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in a single patient, including antiviral resistance to ganciclovir, and resistance mechanisms to all currently available antibiotics.

Globally, approximately 500,000 people die each year due to drug-resistant infections and, if not controlled, these deaths are predicted to exceed 10 million by 2050 [1] . Particularly vulnerable are patients with immune deficiency or dysregulation whose inability to fight infections leads to increased risk of disseminated infection and greater dependency on antimicrobial therapy [2] . Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by overactivation of lymphocytes and macrophages that results in dysregulation of inflammatory responses [3] . While these factors likely put HLH patients at high risk of infection with MDROs, no such reports has been published to date and the clinical course of such infections in these patients remains unknown. Here we report severe infections with multiple MDROs in a patient with cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated HLH.

This was followed by multiple positive blood cultures with Elizabethkingia meningoseptica, E. faecium and pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae, and a positive urine culture with VRE.

Primary or familial HLH may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and are grouped into 5 types based on the affected gene. Type 1 HLH is caused by a defect in chromosome 9, while types 2, 3, 4 and 5 are known to be caused by mutations in familial HLH (fHLH) genes PRF1, UNC13D, STX11 and STXBP2 genes, respectively [7] . At the initial presentation to our hospital in June 18, 2018 with CMV viremia, the patient did not meet criteria for HLH. This diagnosis was made when abroad in India, and treatment started there. Subsequent review identified that the patient developed 8/8 HLH-2004 criteria [8] . In our patient, the history of recurrent infection, the CMV viremia, the clinical diagnosis of HLH and marked reduction in B-cell and NK-cell numbers could suggest an underlying primary immunodeficiency (PID) disorder. However, a sample sent to a referral laboratory to test for PID genes including above HLHassociated genes did not identify significant mutations in known PID genes, suggesting that HLH in our patient was CMV-associated. HLH in an immunocompetent patient secondary to CMV infection is extremely rare but has been reported in the literature [9] . 2 Genotype and antiviral resistance profiles of the cytomegalovirus strain. Nucleic acid extract from patient serum was subjected to NGS library preparation using Nextera XT kit (Illumina, USA) and sequencing was performed on a MiSeq (Illumina). Paired sequence reads were mapped to UL97 and UL54 sequences (Gene ID 3077517 and GenBank accession ABV71585.1, respectively) to obtain corresponding gene sequences from the patient's CMV strain. The sequences were then analyzed by using an online mutational resistance analyzer (MRA) available from the University of Ulm, https://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/ni/mitarbeiter/HKestler/mra/app/index.php?plugin=form [5] . Ganciclovir resistance was confirmed by the presence of the A594V mutation in UL97 [6] What was unique in our patient compared to other reported CMV-associated HLH cases was the overwhelming infection with MDROs. On hospital admission, the patient was found to be colonized with multiple MDROs including VRE, and carbapenamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which may have been acquired during his previous hospital course in India. WGS revealed that the VRE isolate harbored the vanHAX gene cluster that encodes VanA, providing high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Apart from vancomycin resistance, the isolate also possessed genes encoding resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, tetracyclines and aminoglycosides (Table 1) . Phenotypically, the isolate was also resistant to linezolid but we were unable to identify the genetic determinant. The E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates harbored genes encoding a wide array of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms affecting the vast majority of antibiotic classes, including CTX-M-15 and NDM \u03b2-lactamases, the most common extendedspectrum \u03b2-lactamases and carbapenemases, respectively, found in Enterobacterales in India [10, 11] . Notably, the E. coli isolate had 5 different modifying enzymes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, which has rarely been reported [12] . There were also several narrow host range plasmids belonging to the IncF family (replicons FIA, FIB and FII) in the E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains (data not shown) [10] . Since these plasmids can simultaneously harbor most of the genes detected and can be transferred both within the same species and between both species, it is presumed that they played a role in the acquisition and subsequent exchange of resistance determinants among these isolates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 148, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 755, "end": 758, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1322, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1985, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2074, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3169, "end": 3173, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3174, "end": 3177, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3316, "end": 3320, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3490, "end": 3494, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1325, "end": 1326, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2719, "end": 2728, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion and conclusions"}, {"text": "Consequently, our patient developed respiratory, urine and bloodstream infections with highly drug-resistant, including pandrug-resistant, bacteria, which could not be controlled by antibiotic treatment. Although the patient initially responded to the antiviral drug ganciclovir as reflected by a drop in CMV viral load (Fig. 1) , he later became non-responsive to antiviral treatment. Due to the severity of the CMV infection despite ganciclovir treatment, real-time metagenomic analysis was performed, revealing ganciclovir resistance and allowing for tailoring of the antiviral therapy. Although the UL97 mutation detected in this case is well described in the literarture for its association with ganciclovir resistance, the reduced absorption of the drug because of CMVassiciated enterocolitis may have contributed to the development of resistance as well [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 861, "end": 865, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 328, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion and conclusions"}, {"text": "By WGS, the VRE isolate from his urine and the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from his blood culture were found to be of different sequence types compared to the isolates the patient was previously found to be colonized with, but the later clinical isolates harbored both the resistance mechanisms found in the colonizing strains as well as newly acquired resistance mechanisms. In particular, the pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolated from the patient's blood had NDM \u03b2-lactamases in addition to OXA-48 \u03b2-lactamases. Phenotypically, the isolate was resistant to all currently used antibiotics including the last resort antibiotic, colistin. We were unable to detect the mcr gene that is commonly known to encode for colistin resistance and the genetic determinants of colistin resistance remained unknown in this study. While the exchange of resistance determinants via horizontal gene transfer is a possibility, the invasive superbug infections in our patient may have been facilitated by his travel history as well as his CMV-associated enteropathy, which eventually culminated with untreatable sepsis, multiorgan failure and the untimely death.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusions"}, {"text": "Our study has a few limitations. Although the patient was tested for a panel of genes for PID, WGS was not performed to look for other genetic causes of HLH or PID, outside of the commonly known mutations. Also, the clinical course of our patient in India was not well documented and details regarding antibiotic and antiviral treatment of the patient are unknown. However, it appears most likely that the patient acquired MDROs while seeking medical treatment in India, where MDRO infection is frequently associated with hospitalization [14] [15] [16] . Therefore, the risks of MDRO infections associated with medical tourism to regions with high rates of antibiotic resistance should be discussed with patients, who are at higher risk for complications from these organisms. It is important that the travel and other relevant history be elicited from patients so that appropriate screening measures for MDROs can be implemented. Strict infection control measures are necessary to reduce nosocomial transmission of MDROs, especially in centers caring for immunocompromised or critically ill patients. In our institution, we perform risk-based screening for MDROs, implement appropriate isolation measures to prevent spread to other patients and health care workers, and perform WGS to monitor for nosocomial transmission. This case depicts the dire circumstances associated with severe infection with MDR superbugs in a particularly vulnerable patient, and underscores the need for urgent measures to prevent the development of antibiotic resistnace through appropriate use of antimicrobials and to prevent the spread of MDROs through surveillance and implementation of appropriate infection control measures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 548, "end": 552, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusions"}, {"text": "Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s12879-020-04966-z.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Supplementary information"}, {"text": "Additional file 1.
