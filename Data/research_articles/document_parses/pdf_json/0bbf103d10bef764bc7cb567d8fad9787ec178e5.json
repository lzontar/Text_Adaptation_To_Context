The main symptoms included de novo complaints of insomnia, anxiety, and feelings of hopeless, as well as the reactivation of previous disorders, such as depression, anxiety and even suicidal behavior. These mental health problems not only affect patients but also medical workers, which can lead to misunderstandings and poor decision making, and can also hinder the fight against COVID-19, as well as have lasting effects on individual well-being. It was also found that people with health anxiety tend to misinterpret benign bodily sensations and changes as dangerous, which increases hospital visits and, thus, the risk for infection itself. Some authors have focused on specific populations such as the homeless 5 and older adults. 6 Three important factors for overcoming the main difficulties in clinical practice emerge from reports on the Chinese mental health care response to the COVID-19 outbreak 1-7 : 1) multidisciplinary mental health teams (including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, and other mental health professionals) must be established; 2) up-to-date communication with reliable data about the COVID-19 outbreak is necessary; and 3) interventions (mainly psychological counseling) are needed for patients and healthcare providers directly involved in the outbreak (e.g., through electronic devices and apps).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 859, "end": 860, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Initial publications have addressed the overall psychological characteristics of patients and healthcare providers, as well as rapidly implemented interventions to cope with this catastrophic life-threatening scenario.
