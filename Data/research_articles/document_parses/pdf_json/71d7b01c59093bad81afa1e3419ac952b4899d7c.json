In the USA, the Cleveland Clinic has offered inperson shared medical appointments (SMAs) since 1999, in which patients with similar conditions meet with a clinician simultaneously and each receives one-on-one attention. The SMA format allows patients to learn about their disease from both the clinician and peers. In India, Aravind Eye Hospital has successfully trialled SMAs for patients with glaucoma. 1 People who provide SMAs often report improved outcomes and productivity gains through eliminating repetition of common advice; 2 however, acceptance of SMAs has been limited by inertia among patients and clinicians. 3 In the current COVID-19 pandemic, embracing virtual SMAs has potential to enhance provider capacity while mitigating transmission risks and enabling privacy: identity can be withheld, voices disguised, and patient video made visible only to the clinician.",
