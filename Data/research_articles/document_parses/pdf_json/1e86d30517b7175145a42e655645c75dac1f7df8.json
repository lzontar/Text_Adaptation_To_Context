To test the specificity of the anti-ReLM antibodies, they transfected HeK 293 cells with the various ReLM isoforms and then performed western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Not surprisingly, they found a degree of cross-reactivity among the antibodies for the various ReLM isoforms. Moreover, not all antibodies that worked well for western blotting could also be used for immunocytochemistry. The manuscript of Fan et al. (2013) serves once more as a cautionary tale regarding antibody characterization, showing that it is the responsibility of the investigator to provide details concerning the specificity of the antibody for the antigen in question.",

Testing of the rabbit antibodies showed that they recognized the CerS2 protein in wild-type mouse tissues, but were unreactive with tissues from CerS2-deficient animals. In developing and adult mouse brain, the antibodies recognized CerS2 protein in oligodendrocytes, but not in neurons. These results contrast with earlier studies suggesting that CerS2 is expressed in brain neurons in addition to oligodendrocytes. In mouse liver, the antibodies stained hepatocytes, but not Kupfer or Ito cells. By immunoblot analysis, the authors also found that their new antibodies recognized CerS2 in mouse lung, spleen, and kidney, with much smaller amounts detected in skin, heart, and skeletal muscle. with these specific anti-CerS2 antibodies now available, studies to investigate correlation of phenotypes of CerS2-deficient mice with the loss of the protein are possible. This study once again demonstrates the requirement of employing well-characterized antibodies to posit unequivocal conclusions from antibody-based assays.",

These methods can be costly and require the availability of specific antibodies. Grondona et al. (2013) have developed a method for the isolation and purification of ciliated ependymal cells from rodent brain. Starting with explants from the striatal and septal walls of the lateral ventricles, they developed an isolation procedure employing low incubation temperature in tandem with gentle enzymatic digestion. After 6 h of treatment, most of the ependymal cells have been removed from the ventricular wall, together with a small proportion (approximately 6 %) of contaminating cells; however, these contaminating non-ependymal cells can be removed by culturing the cells in a simple culture medium consisting of \u03b1-MeM with glucose (but no further supplements) at very low density. Following culture under these conditions for 48 h, only ependymal cells remained, which could then be maintained for up to 7-10 days. By 7 days in culture, the ependymal cells begin to lose their characteristic ciliated feature, acquiring features of glial cells. Thus, this simplified purification procedure will allow in vitro investigations of adult ependymal cells.",

In many instances, protocols have been established solely on an empirical basis, without rigorous experimentation. Such an instance occurs with choosing the lowest aldehyde concentration required for the complete chemical fixation of various intracellular structures. Zeng et al. (2013a) have now performed a rigorous evaluation of the lowest concentrations of glutaraldehyde alone, or in combination with paraformaldehyde required for complete fixation of the following human umbilical vein endothelial cell structures within 20 min of exposure: focal adhesions, cell surface particles, stress fibers, cell cortex, and inner structures. They used live-cell imaging with differential interference contrast microscopy on a confocal microscope, as well as the MTT assay to determine the effects of the different aldehyde concentrations on the various cellular compartments. They also investigated the effect of aldehyde concentration on the production of cell blebs. Although differing concentrations of aldehydes were required to fix the individual cellular components examined, the authors speculate that for complete fixation of a whole cell within 20 min, concentrations of at least 0.1 % glutaraldehyde and 1.5 % paraformaldehyde would be required; if longer fixation times are employed, these concentrations could likely be decreased.",

Such analysis has progressed from a simple qualitative assessment of color overlap, to a quantitative evaluation using mathematical parameters such as the Manders and Pearson coefficients. Obara et al. (2013) have expanded upon these analysis methods by introducing a bioimage informatics approach to perform quantitative colocalization analysis on blob-like structures in high-resolution three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy datasets from sparsely labeled molecules. This new technique involved two steps: (1) detection of bright isotropic structures representing immunostained human leukocyte antigen receptors in three dimensions in separate channels using confocal microscopy and (2) \"pruning\" of the data, followed by application of a matching procedure based upon centroid detection to reveal the colocalization distance between the fluorescence object in the different channels. Three-dimensional distance maps are constructed to determine how closely centroids from different spots colocalize, and histograms are then used to analyze colocalization distances. This new method provides a means for the creation of super-resolved object-based colocalization maps of isotropic particles, especially in instances of sparse colocalization.",

Among the many available fluorescent probes for DNA, 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) has found widespread use in immunofluorescence protocols due to its excitation by Uv light, which can then be used in conjunction with other visible light-excited fluorophores for immunolabeling procedures. Indeed, some cell/tissue mounting media are available with DAPI as a component, providing ease of nuclear staining in the final slide mounting step. Jez et al. (2013) now report on a potential problem with DAPI staining resulting from photoconversion of DAPI yielding specific detection with a standard microscope fluorescence filter set for blue excitation and green emission. They found that initial imaging of a DAPI-stained sample with a standard green filter set (FITC/GFP) resulted in a weak cytoplasmic autofluorescence signal. Subsequent imaging with a DAPI filter set produced the expected intense nuclear staining; however, re-imaging with the green filter set then resulted in a strong nuclear signal in the green channel. The authors propose that excitation of the DAPI stain with Uv light results in a photoconversion of the dye, leading to excitation and emission with a standard green filter set. This phenomenon could pose a significant interpretation issue if the DAPI staining is combined with the immunofluorescence localization of a nuclear antigen with a blue excitation/ green emission fluorophore. To avoid this issue, the authors propose: (1) using low concentrations of DAPI for staining;",

In PT, tissues are treated with photosensitive compounds (PS), which enter the cell, absorb applied light, and then through photochemical processes dissipate energy, leading to the production of a variety of oxidizing chemical molecules which damage intracellular processes resulting in cell death. PS can be modified with a variety of chemicals, especially acetate, to alter their plasma membrane permeability properties, resulting also in a modification of their fluorescence properties. Pellicciari et al. (2013) sought to determine the intracellular sites of PS activity by performing a diaminobenzidine (DAB) photoconversion of fluorescence reactivity to an electron dense enzymatic product visible by transmission electron microscopy. They treated cultured HeLa cells with two different fluorescent PS, Rose Bengal acetate (RB-Ac) or Hypocrellin B acetate (HypB-Ac), photoconverted their fluorescence properties into an electron dense reaction with DAB, and imaged the final product by electron microscopy. They found that both RB-Ac and HypB-Ac were internalized into the cell through the conventional endocytotic route, starting at the plasma membrane and proceeding through endosomes, and then into lysosomes and multivesicular bodies; this pathway is consistent with the multiorganelle damage associated with cell exposure to both PS compounds. Therefore, photoconversion of modified PS by DAB in the presence of a light source can be used to investigate at high-resolution intracellular sites and modes of oxidative damage inherent in PT.",

In contrast, cells incubated with ZnPC-DMF in the presence of dynasore, genistein, or cytochalasin D showed a marked decrease in ZnPC uptake and a concomitant decrease in cellular photodamage. These endocytic inhibitor-based coincubations with PS revealed that: (1) ZnPC-DMF enters cells via a caveolin-mediated endocytotic process, while (2) ZnPC-liposomes enter via a clathrin-mediated process.

Such histological analyses pose technical issues given the difficulty in infiltrating and embedding both soft and hard tissue samples with the medical implant. willbold et al. (2013) have presented a solution to this problem by developing a new protocol involving embedding the samples in Technovit 9100 New resin, followed by removal of the metallic implants by electrochemical dissolution. electrochemical dissolution is a known method for removing and machining metals, based upon dissolution of a positively charged metallic sample which acts as an anode in an electrically conducting liquid solution. After the dissolution step, the tissue is re-embedded and 5-\u03bcmthick sections are cut with a tungsten blade, followed by staining with histochemical dyes or immunohistochemical reagents. This methodological improvement resulted in fine tissue preservation, both at the implant-tissue interface, and in the surrounding tissue itself. Importantly, the electrochemical dissolution procedure did not adversely affect subsequent staining procedures, making this technique universally applicable for research into potential tissue effects resulting from medical implants.",

Raman spectroscopy uses visible to near-infrared light to measure spectra that reflect the molecular vibrations of tissue molecules. Since the molecular spectra are indicative of the types of atoms and chemical bonding of molecules, they can be used to differentiate between different tissue profiles. The authors performed Raman spectroscopic analysis on unfixed sections from various rat tissues and were able to differentiate between myelinated nerve, unmyelinated nerve, and adjacent tissues. Moreover, by applying the multivariate image analysis technique of ordinary least squares regression (OLSR) on obtained Raman spectra, they were able to detect unmyelinated and myelinated nerves in sectioned tissues from rat and human periprostatic tissue. A specific Raman spectrum resulting from axons and myelin sheath allowed for the differentiation of nerve tissue from non-nerve tissues. Further, the lipid and protein content contributing to the Raman spectra provided for the ability to distinguish myelinated from unmyelinated nerve fibers. Due to the ability of Raman spectroscopy to differentiate between nerve and other tissues, it may provide a unique method to assist surgeons in nerve-sparing surgeries.",

These cells respond to changes in transmembrane potential by modifying their length: membrane depolarization results in cell contraction, whereas hyperpolarization results in cell elongation. The plasma membrane protein prestin, its membrane distribution regulated by thyroid hormone, is believed to account for the electromobility of OHCs. Using a multitechnique approach, Cimerman et al. (2013) have examined the correlation between the subcellular localization and function of prestin, searching for factors responsible for this membrane sublocalization. They detected cochlear expression of a novel prestin splice isoform called prestin 9b. employing a yeast two-hybrid assay, they identified a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) interacting with prestin. Moreover, they found via immunoprecipitation assays that CASK and prestin 9b interact with full-length prestin and that CASK colocalized with prestin in a specific subdomain of the plasma membrane where prestin-expressing OHC membrane contacts a prestin-free zone. Their results corroborate the premise that the distribution of prestin solely in the basolateral plasma membrane in mature OHCs is likely regulated by the thyroid hormone-dependent CASK protein and that this interaction is required for the generation of electromechanical force resulting in cochlear amplification.",

Such information would be useful in the realm of pulp regenerative therapy and pulp capping. Hosoya et al. (2013) performed an immunohistochemical and immunoprecipitation evaluation of factors that may be involved in the regulation of odontoblast differentiation. They found that the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) proteins 1 and 2/3 as well as the zinc finger-containing transcription factor Osterix were colocalized in odontoblast lineage cells in the differentiation stages of dentin formation and regeneration. Moreover, using immunoprecipitation, they found that in a mouse myoblast cell culture (C2C12 cells) system, the Osterix protein could be SUMOylated by SUMO-1. Taken together, their results indicate that SUMOylation of proteins such as Osterix affects dentinogenesis via transcriptional regulation. Ookuma et al.

Growth inhibition of the tooth germ in cultured embryonic day 11 (e11) was detected in an assay using T\u03b24 antisense sulfur-substituted oligodeoxynucleotide (AS S-ODN); in contrast, no growth arrest was detected in e15 tooth germ. Moreover, T\u03b24 knockdown resulted in decreased levels of type II/III runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and nucleolin (Ncl) in the e11 tissues, as well as decreased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2, reduced cell motility, and an up-regulation of E-cadherin in cultured dental epithelial cells. These results indicate that T\u03b24 is involved in multiple functions during the development of mouse lower first molar, likely via the regulation of the expression of type II/III Runx2 and Ncl, inhibited secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2, inhibition of cell motility, and up-regulation of E-cadherin.",

They found that Rbp4 was localized to a restricted population of epiphyseal chondrocytes and perichondral cells in a region responsible for subsequent secondary ossification. Moreover, following secondary ossification processes, Rbp4 was demonstrated in chondrocytes both from the resting zone and those bordering invading cartilage canals; less immunostaining for Rbp4 was detected in proliferating chondrocytes from primary ossification.

They used immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and flow cytometric techniques to show that ALDH1A3 and ALDH3A1 were expressed in the upper suprabasal layer of the keratinocytes, and cells with high ALDH activity displayed a proliferative phenotype. By inhibiting ALDH activity with diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DeAB), the keratinocytes displayed a more quiescent, non-proliferative state. Regenerated oral epithelium from ALDH1A3 siRNA knockdown showed a phenotype similar to that from those treated with DeAB, and ADH3A1 siRNA knockdown inhibited the epithelial regenerative capacity of the keratinocytes. These results suggest that the phenotypic changes expressed by keratinocytes following treatment with DeAB were likely due to inhibition of isozyme ALDH1A3 activity. Moreover, they show that genetic inhibition of ALDH3A1 affected the regenerative ability of oral keratinocytes, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of DeAB was restricted to the differentiated cells in the suprabasal layer rather than on the undifferentiated cells in the basal layer, with implications for oral mucosal regeneration strategies.",

In brown fat adipocytes, Acot1 has been proposed to regulate the levels of cytosolic acyl-CoAs during cell maturation. Ohtomo et al. (2013) investigated whether similar regulation may occur in other cell types that utilize fatty acids, specifically white fat adipocytes. Thus, they examined the expression and distribution of Acot1 in white adipose tissue from rats, and following cellular differentiation in culture. They found that Acot1 was detected in the cytoplasm of immature adipocytes located in the perivascular of white adipose tissue. By immunohistochemical analysis, they detected Acot1 in layered structures surrounding blood vessel adventitia in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Digestion of tissue with collagenase followed by centrifugation resulted in Acot1 in the stromal vascular fraction, but not in mature large adipocytes. After adipocyte induction to differentiation by a 15-day pretreatment without insulin, dedifferentiated cells expressed increased Acot1 in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that since Acot1 expression is up-regulated during early adipocyte maturation, but not detectable in mature adipocytes, it may be involved in acyl-CoA metabolism in immature white adipocytes. vascular endothelial growth factor C (veGF-C) has been linked to the growth of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis), contributing to the pathology of several human diseases, including tumor formation.

Additionally, they analyzed the density of both lymphatic and blood vessels using specific antibody markers. Their results showed that lymphatic vessel density, as well as expression of both veGF-C and veGFR-3 was increased in pterygium versus normal conjunctival tissue. veGF-C immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasm of both normal and pterygial epithelial cells, with an increased number of positive stained cells observed in the pterygial samples.

They performed gene expression using the GeneSapiens databank, localized decorin mRNA expression with in situ hybridization, and examined the effect of decorin transduction on the subsequent behavior of a human cancer cell line. Their results showed that although significant decorin gene expression was found in human breast cancers by GeneSapiens databank, the cellular resolution of in situ hybridization clearly demonstrated that decorin was not expressed by cancer cells, but only by stromal cells. Moreover, they found that transduced expression of decorin into a cancer cell line altered the proliferation and cohesion properties of these cells. The authors propose that targeted expression of transduced decorin into breast cancer cells could be utilized as a potential adjuvant therapy for breast cancer treatment.",

Irschick et al. (2013) investigated internalization and intracellular trafficking of FGFR1 conjugated to eGFP in a human glioblastoma cell line. They showed with exquisite immunofluorescence colocalization analysis that upon stimulation of the glioma cells with FGF-2, the overexpressed FGFR1 was endocytosed into the early endosome pathway via a clathrin-and caveolindependent manner. Subsequently, the FGFR1 receptor was found to travel into both the recycling and lysosomal degradation pathways. This cell model may prove useful for further investigations into blocking the recycling receptor pathway as a therapeutic approach to glioblastoma treatment.",

Recently, it has been shown that repetitive nuclear ruptures occur in fibroblasts cultured from patients with laminopathies, with a strong correlation with disease severity, making this a promising avenue for further investigations into a potential disease biomarker. Houben et al. (2013) report on their investigations of PML nuclear bodies, structures normally found in the nucleus which leak out into the cytoplasm (becoming cytoplasmic PML particles; PML CPs) upon nuclear rupture. Using immunostained fibroblast cells cultured from laminopathy patients, together with confocal microscopy imaging, they demonstrated an increased number of PML CPs in cells having nuclear abnormalities, and that the number of particles could be indicative of disease severity. Interestingly, they also found that in patient fibroblasts without demonstrable nuclear abnormalities the percentage of cells showing PML CPs was increased. The authors thus suggest that analysis of PML CPs in cultured fibroblasts from patients with laminopathies could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for disease diagnosis and severity.",

(2013) have explored antibodies raised against the peroxisome biogenesis protein PeX14 and propose that they represent the ideal standard marker as compared to catalase and ABCD3. In their highly detailed, comparative analysis including western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunoelectron microscopy, they demonstrated the superiority of PeX14 antibodies for studying peroxisomes in various cells and tissues from different animal species and humans. By using Quantum dots, they were able to increase the detection limit of immunofluorescence and to overcome commonly encountered problems due to photobleaching observed with fluorochromes. The authors also pointed out that the use of PeX14 antibodies provides optimal conditions for comparative morphometric analysis of peroxisomes. In another publication by Baumgart-vogt et al. , the usefulness of antibodies against superoxide dismutase (SOD2) as markers for peroxisomes and mitochondria was analyzed. Contrary to other reports, they found that in a large spectrum of cells and tissues SOD2 was unequivocally identified in mitochondria but not in peroxisomes.

Besides immunohistochemistry, laser-assisted microdissection of ameloblasts and odontoblasts for RNA isolation and subsequent RT-PCR was applied. Peroxisomes were already detected at the bud stage of dental development, an increase in abundance found during differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts, a strong heterogeneity of peroxisomal enzyme content occurred within differentiated dental cell types, and a strong down-regulation of catalase was noted in maturing ameloblasts, whereas levels of lipid metabolizing enzymes were high. Suzuki et al. (2013) aimed at establishing functions of protein kinase C for lipid droplets. They found seven PKC isoforms tagged with eGFP associated with lipid droplets. Specifically, they found that PKC\u03b7 and to a lesser extent two other novel PKCs, PKC\u03b4 and PKC\u03b5, tended to concentrate at the surface of lipid droplets. Moreover, overexpression of PKCg reduced the average size of lipid droplets compared with the control even when synthesis of lipid esters was activated. It was proposed that PKC\u03b7 is involved in regulating lipid metabolism in lipid droplets by phosphorylating substrates whose identity is currently unknown. exosomes and microvesicles are particular cellular structures released from the cell surface by an unconventional mode of exocytosis. As far as it is known, they are involved in intercellular communication and transfer of protein, lipids, and mitochondrial DNA as well as RNAs. Falchi et al.

The astrocyte-derived vesicle membrane was positive for \u03b21-integrins, a marker for shedding, and the vesicle content consisted of mitochondria and lipid droplets and ATP. The shedding of the large vesicles occurred after repetitive ATP stimulation.",

A most intensely studied aspect of its highly complex function is transport. warren (2013) reviewed and discussed transport through the Golgi apparatus in Trypanosoma brucei. The major advantage of analyzing this protozoan parasite is that it is \"a stripped-down eukaryote\" containing a single Golgi apparatus through which the GPIanchored variant surface glycoprotein (vSG) is transported and delivered to the flagellar pocket membrane. Notably, the vSG represents >95 % of the surface proteins. By integration of the available morphological and biochemical data, warren suggests that stable cisternae, as compared to cisternal maturation, represent the more likely transport mode in Trypanosoma brucei. In further reviews, transport through the Golgi apparatus of mammalian and plant cells and its enormous complexity were discussed. Day et al. (2013) proposed a three-stage model of Golgi apparatus structure and function. They categorized Golgi cisternae into three classes according to their function in import and export and proposed that the three classes correspond to functional stages of maturation. Their three-stage model is based on advanced electron microscopic analysis by electron tomography of high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted cells. The first stage is related to the formation of new cisternae by eR-derived COPII vesicles. The second stage corresponds to cisternae involved in glycosylation and polysaccharide synthesis. The third stage represents cisternae forming various types of transport carriers including clathrin-coated vesicles. It is emphasized that discrete transitions occur during the maturation of the cisternae from one stage to the next. Boncompain and Perez (2013) presented a very detailed review about aspects of Golgi apparatus transport as they relate to the diversity of the secretory cargos, the machineries involved in cargo transport and the specificity of Golgi-dependent transport routes and discussed them in view of the models of cisternal maturation or static cisternae. As also emphasized in the other reviews, depending on the functional situation, the models of cisternal maturation or static cisternae are not mutually exclusive, and Boncompain and Perez (2013) propose an integrative model of intra-Golgi transport. Likewise, Mironov et al. (2013) compared different models of intra-Golgi transport from the point of view of their ability to explain existing experimental facts. In their view, the kiss-and-run (KAR) model they had proposed in 2008 (Mironov and Beznoussenko 2008) has the highest potential for the explanation of the majority of experimental observations. The review by Machamer (2013) provided a very timely discussion of the transport of large cargo-procollagen and lipoprotein particles or coronaviruses-within the Golgi cisternal stack. Transport of large rod-shaped procollagen or of large spherical chylomicrons or coronaviruses requires the reversible, local dilation of part of Golgi cisternae. Aspects of the possible importance of the activation of the Src family kinase (SFK) signaling, the flux of osmotically active ions and water, and the importance of GRASPs and Golgins for the trafficking were highlighted.",

The various signaling events occurring at the eR-Golgi apparatus interface involve several kinases such as PCTAIRe, the serine/threonine kinase AKT, or CK2 that appear to regulate the efficiency of the eR export by regulating the production and progression of COPII vesicles. In contrast, only little is known about signaling at the level of the eRGIC, alias intermediate compartment, alias pre-Golgi intermediates, whereas signaling by Ras GTPases and Src family kinases at the level of the Golgi apparatus is well established. Signaling in the Golgi apparatus appears also to involve the Golgi matrix proteins GRASP65 and GRASP55 as well as ion channels for Mn 2+ and Ca 2+ transport. As emphasized by the authors, the field of signal transduction for the organization of the eR-Golgi system is still in its infancy. The focus of the review by Cancino et al.

This function involves the formation of a subset of non-centrosomal microtubules at the Golgi apparatus that are indispensable not only for the organization of the Golgi apparatus as an organelle but also for post-Golgi trafficking and cell polarity. The authors detailed the molecular machinery involved in the nucleation of microtubules at Golgi membranes and the functions of Golgiderived microtubules in Golgi assembly and directional post-Golgi trafficking, as well as their role for establishing cell polarity and polarized cell migration. Another component of the cytoskeleton, actin, together with its binding and regulatory proteins, is important for the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and for Golgi-associated trafficking. In their review, egea et al. (2013) summarized the current knowledge of actin function as it relates to the Golgi apparatus in terms of its structural organization and its function in trafficking, including sorting as well as the formation and movement of Golgi-derived transport carriers. They also reviewed the relation between the Golgi apparatus and actin in plant cells, yeast, Drosophila, Dictyostelium discoideum, and Caenorhabditis elegans.",

As pointed out by the authors, this knowledge is an important prerequisite for further investigations on the role of lung intermediate filaments and their disease-causing mutations in animal models and human lung diseases. Pant and coworkers (Binukumar et al. 2013 ) reviewed the topographic regulation of neuronal intermediate filaments by phosphorylation with emphasis on the role of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1) and the significance of defects of these phosphorylation processes for neurodegeneration. Lepinoux-Chambaud and eyer (2013) reviewed various aspects of nervous system intermediate filaments such as their abnormal accumulation and perturbed metabolism in neurodegeneration, and their potential use as biomarkers to assess progression of neurodegeneration or targets for brain tumors. From the group of Pekny (de Pablo et al. 2013) , original work on the importance of intermediate filaments for astrocyte response to oxidative stress induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion was reported. They demonstrated the importance of intermediate filaments in the elimination of reactive oxygen species. Olbrich et al.

In addition, they reviewed the role of plectin isoforms in stress-prone tissues such as skin, skeletal muscle, and Schwann cells of peripheral nerves and implicated diseases. Tsoupri and Capetanaki (2013) reviewed the muscle-specific intermediate filament desmin and myospryn, a novel desmin-associated TRIM-like protein. They focused on the importance of the association for mechanochemical signaling in the regulation of muscle development and homeostasis, as well as aspects of the disregulation of the desmin-myospryn interactome resulting in diseases of the cardiac and skeletal muscles.

Hayes et al. (2013) examined the localization of fibrillin-1 and perlecan in the fetal human, wild-type C57BL/6, and HS-deficient hspg2\u0394 3\u2212 /\u0394 3\u2212 exon 3 null mouse IvD by confocal immunofluorescence. Fibrillin-1 fibrils were prominent components of the outer posterior and anterior annulus fibrosus of the fetal human IvD. Finer fibrillin-1 fibrils observed in the inner annulus fibrosus displayed an arcade-type arrangement in the developing lamellae. Short fibrillin-1 fibrils were present in the central region of the IvD and presumptive cartilaginous endplate and defined the margins of the nuclear sheath in the developing nucleus pulposus. Likewise, fibrillin-1 was also demonstrated in the annulus fibrosus of C57BL/6 wild-type mice, but to a far lesser extent in the HS-deficient hspg2\u0394 3\u2212 /\u0394 3\u2212 exon 3 null mouse. It was concluded that the HS chains of perlecan may contribute to fibrillin-1 assembly or its deposition in the IvD. The cell-matrix interconnections formed by the fibrillin fibrils were suggested to facilitate communication between disc cells and their local biomechanical microenvironment in mechanosensory processes which regulate tissue homeostasis. The ability of fibrillin-1 to sequester TGF-\u03b2, a well-known anabolic growth factor in the IvD also suggests potential roles in disc development and/or remodeling. Leitch et al. (2013) reported findings on the retinolbinding protein 4 during osteogenesis, since it is not only known that retinoid signaling has an essential role in skeletal development, but as also shown in their previous gene microarray study, retinol-binding protein 4 was the most highly down-regulated gene in suture tissue during the pathological process of premature bony fusion. To analyze the function of retinol-binding protein 4 in cranial suture, they studied primary cell cultures derived from human cranial suture mesenchyme and found that retinol-binding protein 4 was down-regulated during mineralization. They also observed that retinol-binding protein 4 was not secreted, which they interpreted as evidence for a cell-autonomous action. Based on the intracellular distribution of retinolbinding protein 4, the authors speculated that it has functions in addition to being a serum transporter of retinol, and hence a broader role in osteogenesis than currently assumed.",

Furthermore, Fras1 displayed a segmental localization pattern since it was restricted to certain regions of the meningeal basement membrane. The Frem2 protein exhibited a similar localization pattern, while Frem3 was rather uniformly distributed throughout the meningeal basement membrane. On the other hand, Fras1 and Frem2 proteins were detected in regions of the basement membrane that underlie organizing centers, such as the roof plate of diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain, and the roof plate-derived structures of telencephalon.

            "text": "Autophagy is a mode of type II cell death, in which cellular components are degraded in newly formed doublemembraned structures called autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with primary lysosomes. The activity of autophagosomes can be increased by nutrient starvation and may be a critical mechanism by which cells survive under severe conditions. The protein Beclin-1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells. Kim et al. (2013) examined the effect of Beclin-1 knockdown in cultured HT22 neurons challenged with amino acid starvation (AAS) on the autophagic response. In wild-type cells, 3 h post-AAS exposure led to an induction of light chain-3 (LC-3)-immunopositive and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) fluorescent dyelabeled autophagosome formation, as well as an increase in autophagosome-targeting LC3-II. Moreover, AAS treatment also led to slight-to-moderate activation of the levels of apoptotic factors caspase-3 and AIF. In contrast, knockdown of Beclin-1 resulted in reduced AAS-induced LC3-II increase, autophagosome formation, and enhanced neuronal cell death. These results indicate that a decrease in autophagy resulting from Beclin-1 knockdown leads to an increased susceptibility to AAS-induced pro-apoptotic signals, emphasizing the idea that autophagy may represent a cell protective, rather than destructive mechanism under extreme nutrient conditions. Similar to apoptosis, autophagy is also believed to play a role in programmed cell death during development. Yang et al. (2013) sought to investigate the role of autophagy in murine tooth development and whether it interacts with the apoptotic developmental mechanism. They used a variety of experimental protocols, including RT-PCR for autophagyrelated genes, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, dual immunofluorescence analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. Results from their analyses showed that autophagy is involved, and in some cases overlapped with apoptotic mechanisms during tooth development in 1 3 murine embryos and neonates. Their studies reveal that the cell death mechanisms of apoptosis and autophagy need not be mutually exclusive during tissue development and that the developing tooth germ in the mouse may represent an attractive model for investigating these mechanisms.",

They performed colocalization fluorescence analyses of Lyso-ID and Cyto-ID with well-known markers for the autophagic and endolysosomal pathways in live cells. They found that Lyso-ID specifically labeled acidic compartments also stained with the late endosome/lysosome markers Lamp1 and CINC-CKvL. Likewise, they observed that Cyto-ID labeled intracellular compartments also stained with LC3, a marker for autophagosomes (see above). Dual labeling of cells with Lyso-ID and Cyto-ID resulted in compartments labeled with either one, or both of the probes, showing that these fluorescent probes can be used to specifically label the lysosomal or autophagosomal pathways and compartments in live cells, making them useful and specific probes for evaluating the autophagosomal response in cultured cells.",

Differentiation into chondrocytes requires the activation of the wnt signaling pathway; regulation of this wnt pathway is dependent upon glycogen synthase kinase-3. eslaminejad et al. (2013) performed experiments to investigate the effect of two glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitors, lithium chloride (LiCl) and the small-molecule SB216763 on a human-derived MSC chondrogenic culture. Cell cultures were treated with the two GSK-3 inhibitors in the presence of TGF-\u03b21 or TGF-\u03b2 3 for 21 days and then analyzed for the expression of cartilage-specific genes. The results showed an upregulation of these cartilage-specific genes by both GSK-3 inhibitors, with SB216763 appearing to be more potent than LiCl. Moreover, treatment with SB216763 resulted in a greater deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the cell culture. These results demonstrate that addition of both LiCl and SB216763 to a chondrogenic cell culture leads to an up-regulation of cartilage-specific genes through a wnt/\u03b2catenin specific pathway. Li et al. (2013b) also studied the differentiation of bonederived MSCs into chondrocytes, focusing on the importance of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) chains in this process. exposing cultured MSCs to p-nitrophenol xyloside (PNPX), a competitive acceptor of CS/DS chains on proteoglycans, resulted in a delay in the onset of chondrogenesis as evidenced by a rounding-up and cell aggregation into spheroids. Moreover, PNPX exposure also caused a reduced expression of the cartilage-specific genes SOX-9, aggrecan, and collagen type II, as well as a reduction in collagen type II protein. Additionally, a delayed expression of a native CD/DS sulfation motif epitope specifically recognized by the antibody 6C3 was evident in cultured cells treated with PNPX. In aggregate, these results suggest that disruption of CS/DS chain attachment to proteoglycan core proteins alters the process of chondrocytic cell aggregation, affecting subsequent cartilage formation. CS/DS chains thus appear to be intimately involved in the initial stages of chondrogenesis, likely through specific sulfation motif sequences within their glycosaminoglycol chain structure.",

Pekovits et al.

Assays included the ability of the cells to proliferate in culture with a well attached, spread morphology, as well as the presence of a consistent set of cell surface markers. Their results showed that human alveolar bone contains mesenchymal progenitor cells (hABDCs) that can be isolated and expanded in vitro. Further, upon appropriate stimulation, these hABDCs were shown to differentiate into an osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic cell lineage as do mesenchymal cells from other tissue targets, thereby providing a source of multipotent stem cells from an accessible tissue. Morphologically, the hABDCs resembled bone marrow mesenchymal cells in that they were mononuclear, fibroblast-like, spindle-shaped, and adhered well to plastic substrates. Thus, these hABDCs should be of special interest in cases of dental surgery, where the alveolar bone is readily accessible, requiring no additional surgical intervention, nor extra-oral donor site.",

This morphological appearance, which is maintained by the cellular cytoskeleton, seems to be a critical characteristic for the ability of the cells to migrate. Moon et al. (2013) examined this process by investigating the immunohistochemical expression of ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (eRM) family of proteins known to be involved in linking the cytoskeleton with the cell plasma membrane, in murine developing brain, adult brain, and adult neural stem cells in vitro. eRM proteins were found to be highly expressed in: (1) early postnatal RMS; (2) ventricular zone of embryonal cerebral cortex; and (3) in vivo and in vitro neuroblasts. Moreover, ezrin expression was found to diminish as neuroblasts migrated. In vitro differentiation of adult neural stem cells showed that ezrin was expressed by neural stem cells, neuroblasts, and astrocytes, but not by cells with oligodendrocytic progeny. These results suggest that eRM proteins may be involved in the process of neuroblast migration along the RMS via their actin-binding properties.",

The results demonstrated similar expression of many MyHC isoforms in intrafusal fibers from both muscle types, yet many differences were also revealed, suggesting muscle-specific proprioceptive control.

After a contusion injury, LIF is up-regulated; moreover, muscle regeneration was adversely affected in an LIF-knockout mouse model based upon morphometric analysis. They also examined an inflammatory component of LIF-mediated muscle regeneration by injection of the myotoxic compound notexin and employing the LIF agonist MH35-BD. After injection with notexin, an upregulation of both LIF protein and mRNA was detected to occur in a two-phase response: the first phase included an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the second phase included myogenic differentiation and the formation of new myotubes. Treatment with MH35-BD during the second phase of LIF up-regulation did not result in an effect on genes required for myocyte differentiation or associated with inflammation; on the other hand, treatment with the LIF agonist during the initial response phase resulted in an increased expression of gene transcripts for several pro-inflammatory cytokines, concomitant with an increased number of neutrophils infiltrating the damaged muscle tissue. Subsequently, a decrease in myogenin mRNA was noted, with a diminished number of myotubes formed in the MH35-BD-treated versus control groups. Their results suggest that LIF functions in skeletal muscle regeneration not by directly effecting muscle cells, but rather by regulating the local inflammatory response to tissue damage.",

Since normal alveolar oxygen pressures lead to pro-inflammatory effects, the presence of local antioxidants is necessary to negate such effects. Since the surfactant-stimulating recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (rhKGF) has been proposed to assist in diminishing the injurious effects of hyperoxia on pulmonary epithelial cells, Koslowski et al.

In response to rhKGF treatment, they found the following results: (1) increased PCNA mRNA expression, indicating enhanced cell proliferation; (2) increased expression of three genes involved in oxygen radical protection (ATP-binding cassette protein A3, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase); and (3) increased mRNA levels of acyl-coA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase I (catalyzes dipalmitoyl-PC synthesis) and adipose triglyceride lipase (supplies fatty acids for surfactant PC synthesis). Given these results showing that rhKGF stimulated genes involved in alveolar type II cell proliferation and differentiation, PC synthesis, and anti-oxidative capacity, this growth factor may be a useful alternative to glucocorticoid treatment in preventing potential impaired lung development complications in preterm infants.",

Under these conditions, morphological analysis revealed less compact heart tissue in rats exposed to moderate hyperoxia, and a decreased number of nuclei, and thus cells, in tissue sections from animals exposed to severe hyperoxia.

The saphenous vein grafts used in CABG are subsequently prone to atherosclerosis, with an early step in this process the infiltration of macrophages. Malinska et al. (2013) investigated the presence of CD68-positive macrophages in saphenous veins harvested from patients arranged into the following two groups: (1) those between 50 and 70 years of age and (2) those 70 years of age or older. Using immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy, they found no differences in the content of macrophages between the two age groups. They also found that macrophages were only observed in the tunica intima layer if also present in the tunica media or tunica adventitia layer. when macrophages were detected in the tunica intima, the authors found that these patients had a higher number of bypass stenoses compared with patients without CD68-positive cells in this layer. The authors speculate that the presence of CB68-positive macrophages in the tunica intima may serve as an early indicator of potential saphenous vein graft occlusion.",

(2013) performed an exhaustive investigation of 19 cloned Mrg subtypes in normal and two inflamed models of mouse intestine. They employed the methods of RT-PCR, QT-PCR, and multiimmunofluorescence microscopy, to analyze the expression of these Mrg subtypes in mouse ileum and related dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in control, versus two models of inflammation utlilizing either exposure to intestinal schistosomiasis or treatment with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. They observed that most of the Mrg subtypes were only sparsely expressed (displaying a neuron-specific) pattern in the non-inflamed control ileum. In contrast, in experimentally inflamed ileum, they found the following results: (1) MrgA4, MrgB2, and MrgB8 were detected in an increased number of enteric sensory neurons and nerve fibers located in the intestinal lamina propria; (2) MrgB10 was found in both enteric sensory neurons and mast cells newly recruited to the intestinal mucosa; and (3) the Mrg10B expressing mast cells were noted to be in close proximity to nerve fibers in the lamina propria. while some differences were noted in Mrg subtype expression between the two inflammatory models investigated, in general their results have shown that multiple Mrg subtypes are up-regulated in response to intestinal inflammation; interestingly, the upregulation of these Mrg receptors was mainly restricted to the sensory afferent neurons in the ileum and in newly recruited mast cells present therein. These results should have potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of intestinal inflammatory conditions. Beyer et al. (2013) also investigated the characterization of enteric neuronal subpopulations. Using immunofluorescence techniques, they performed quadruple immunostaining on human intestinal segment wholemounts and double immunostaining on intestinal cryosections. The wholemounts were immunostained with antibodies against calretinin (CALR), somatostatin (SOM), substance P (SP), and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). By immunofluorescence observation they found: (1) all SOM-positive neurons costained for ChAT, while 50-75 % co-stained with SP (50 % in small intestinal external submucosal plexus (eSP) and 75 % in colonic eSP); (2) by contrast, between 77 and 92 % of CALR-positive neurons co-stained with ChAT, while <4 % co-stained with SP; and (3) wholemounts stained with an antibody against peripherin (marker allowing morphological analysis) revealed that both SOM-positive and SOM/SP double-positive neurons showed uniaxial morphology. Cryostat sections doubly immunostained for SOM and SP revealed: (1) co-positive nerve fibers only detected in the mucosa; (2) SOM singly stained neuronal fibers seen around submucosal arteries; and (3) SP-singly stained fibers located in the muscularis propria. Their results indicate that the chemical code of SOM-immunoreactive human submucosal neurons is ChAT+/SOM+/SP+\u2212 and that the overall target of SOM(/SP)-neurons is the mucosa.",

The stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus intersects with the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach at a \"squamocolumnar\" epithelial junction. Since eph receptor family proteins have been proposed to be involved in tissue interactions, including tissue-border formation, Ogawa et al. (2013) investigated the expression of ephB2 and ephrin-B1 in epithelial cells at the rodent squamocolumnar border, as well as ephB2/ephrin-B1 signaling in cultured rat gastric keratinocytes. On immuostained tissue sections they found unique staining patterns for the two proteins along the proximal-to-distal axis of the gastric epithelium across the squamocolumnar junction: staining for ephB2 was most intense near the junction, and greatly diminished in the stratified squamous epithelium a short distance away, while in contrast staining for ephrin-B1 was maximal in the stratified squamous epithelium, and sharply decreased upon approach to the squamocolumnar junction. These immunostaining results suggest that ephB2/ephrin-B1 signaling occurs mainly in the epithelium across the squamocolumnar junction, where the expression of the receptor and ligand is maximal. Moreover, their results indicate that ephB2 preferentially bound ephrin-B1. Finally, using a cell culture system, they found that cell repulsion/lateral migration was induced in gastric keratinocytes on ephrin-B1-and ephB2-coated substrates. Taken together, their results suggest that ephB2 and ephrin-B1 molecules may be involved in boundary formation at the rodent squamocolumnar junction.",

Ischemia/reperfusion damage also occurs in other tissues, such as intestine. Chen et al. (2013) have used their well-documented in vivo cryotechnique (IvCT), known to preserve soluble cellular components (such as signal transduction molecules) to investigate the involvement of the eRK1/2 signal transduction pathway after mouse intestinal ischemia/reperfusion by immunostaining for peRK1/2 and pCReB on frozen, freeze-substituted tissue sections. In control tissue sections, eRK immunoreactivity was widely observed in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelial cells, whereas peRK1/2 was much more restricted in distribution to some epithelial cells present in the crypt region and at the tops of villi. Following a 5-min exposure to ischemic conditions, more peRK1/2 immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial cells of the crypts; after 60 min of reperfusion, peRK1/2 expression was detected in wide areas of intestinal epithelial cells. After 20 and 60 min of ischemia, pCReB immunoreactivity was found in the nuclei of epithelial cells from the same areas found to be stained for peRK1/2. 20 min of ischemia followed by 60 min reperfusion resulted in a reduction in peRK1/2 immunoreactivity in the crypt epithelial cells, whereas, in contrast, 60 min of ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion resulted in strong peRK1/2 immunoreactivity in crypt epithelial cells. These results indicate a rapidly changing expression of the signaling molecule peRK1/2 in intestinal epithelial cells in response to an ischemic insult, with or without reperfusion, suggesting a role in regulation of cell survival. Asan et al. (2013) published a most informative and timely review on the serotonergic innervation of the amygdala. The importance of amygdala lies in the fact that it is a core component of neural circuits that mediate processing of emotional, particularly anxiety and fear-related stimuli, across species. Furthermore, it plays a key role in the central nervous system stress response, and alterations in amygdala responsivity are found in neuropsychiatric disorders, especially those precipitated or sustained by stressors. Specifically, the authors in their review focused on organizational principles of the amygdala in rodents, non-human primates, and humans. They summarized and critically analyzed findings on the origin, morphology, and targets of serotonergic innervation, the distribution patterns and cellular expression of serotonin receptors, and the consequences of stress and pharmacological manipulations of serotonergic transmission in the amygdala with focus on the extensively studied basolateral complex and central nucleus.",

By immunohistochemistry, the cerebellar molecular layer showed strongest staining that overlapped with immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Reduction in immunostaining intensity for angiotensin II receptors was observed following 5 and 10 min of hypoxia or the administration of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan. The immunoreactivity in the adrenal gland which was defined to the zona glomerulosa did not change following hypoxia. These data provided another example of the superior performance of the in vivo cryotechnique for the immunolocalization of receptors. elongation factor 1A (eeF1A) is well known for its function in protein de novo synthesis. In addition, it has non-canonical functions related to actin bundling and it interacts with microtubules. Becker et al. (2013) investigated the effects of two mammalian eeF1A isoforms on the scaffold protein gephyrin, which plays an important role for concentrating receptors in postsynaptic membranes of the central nervous system. They observed partial colocalization of gephyrin and F-actin along filamentous structures in rat hippocampal neurons. Following a 3-week period of eeF1A overexpression, cultured hippocampal neurons showed an increase in number, size and density of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters. The authors proposed that the observed effects of eeF1A overexpression indicate the stabilization of gephyrin at inhibitory synapses and that this may serve to maintain the synaptic homeostasis in neurons.",

(2013) have analyzed heterozygous and homozygous tryptophan hydroxylase-2 knockout mice to assess the influence of 5-HT deficiency on the GABA system. In heterozygous, but not in homozygous knockout or wild-type mice, the amygdala had significant increased GABA concentrations, whereas GABA concentration of the prefrontal cortex was significantly decreased. Remarkably, the hippocampus of homozygous knockout mice had increased GABA concentrations. Likewise, although the total cell density was unchanged, the density and number of GABAergic interneurons in the anterior basolateral amygdala of homozygous knockout mice was significantly decreased. The authors conclude that the effects of reduction or complete lack of brain 5-HT transmission in limbic regions they observed provide a basis for additional detailed analysis and will help to explore more deeply the regulation of emotional behavior. walton et al. (2013a) have performed an immunohistochemical analysis on the usefulness of neural stem and progenitor cell (NPC) markers in the dog. The choice of a canine model resulted from the notion that the canine brain as compared to rodent brains is more similar to the human brain in its physical organization and that many well-defined neurological diseases in the dog serve as analogs of human brain diseases. The distribution of NPCs in the three major postnatal neurogenic regions, the rostral subventricular zone (SvZ), hippocampus, and cerebellum was analyzed using antibodies against CD15, CD133, nestin, GFAP, and phosphacan. Taken together, their results demonstrated that in the dog, immunoreactivity for these markers was detected in regions known to be neurogenic in rodents and primates. Zeng et al. (2013b) reported on the expression of P2X 5 receptor subunit in neurons of dorsal root ganglia of various mammalian species. They observed quantitative differences with low levels of immunostaining in rat dorsal root ganglia, but high levels in mouse and guinea pig. In contrast, only a few neurons were immunoreactive for P2X 5 receptors in cat. At the cellular level, the P2X 5 receptor in mouse dorsal root ganglia was expressed largely by medium-diameter neurons and less in small and large neurons. However, in the guinea pig, P2X 5 receptor expression was greatest in small-diameter and less in medium-and large-diameter neurons. In addition, results of codistribution analysis with the neurofilament marker NF-200, the calcitonin gene-related peptide, calbindin, and nitric oxide synthase were reported. Uno et al.

To analyze complex geometric shapes, they used fractal dimension (D) to classify the subclasses of enteric neurons. By their fractal analysis, seven different neuronal subtypes could be differentiated according to a rising D. within the same D, the neurite length revealed significant differences between wild-type and FGF2-knockout cultures. The subclass distribution was also altered in the knockout mice and showed a reduction in a secretomotor neuronal type. In wholemount preparations, a reduction in up to 40 % of these neurons was observed.

Previously, Ohno and coworkers and others reported on the membrane skeletal molecular complex composed of 4.1G, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase, membrane protein palmitoylated 6 (MPP6), and cell adhesion molecule 4 in Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. In continuation of these studies, Terada et al. (2013) identified and localized a signal transduction protein, Src, in the Schmidt-Lanterman incisures and analyzed its phosporylation state in Y527 and Y418 under normal conditions and after deletion of 4.1G. In normal nerves, strong staining for P527-Src was detected in the Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. In 4.1G-deficient nerve fibers, which were devoid of both 4.1G and MPP6, P418-Src immunostaining in Schmidt-Lanterman incisures was strong in contrast to the weak staining in normal nerve fibers. Apparently, Src and MPP6 formed complexes as indicated by immunoprecipitation analysis. Together, it was concluded that the Src-MPP6-4.1G complex in Schmidt-Lanterman incisures functions in signal transduction.",

In von ebner's gland, gustducin-immunoreactive cells corresponded to clear cells devoid of secretory granules which were situated in the gland end portion.

In the kidney of adult human and mouse, SvCT1 is present in the apical plasma membrane of proximal tubule epithelia. Nualart et al.

By RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, SvCT1 expression increased progressively during postnatal kidney development, although in embryonic kidney SvCT1 transcripts were barely detected, if not absent. However, SvCT2, the high-affinity transporter, was strongly expressed in the developing kidney from embryonic day 15, but decreased during postnatal stages. Immunohistochemical analyses showed a changing pattern of subcellular distribution of SvCT2 during kidney development. In cortical epithelial cells, intracellular distribution of SvCT2 was observed at embryonic day 19 and along the basolateral plasma membrane domain at postnatal day 1. On the other hand, SvCT2 was detectable in the apical and basolateral membrane domains between embryonic day 17 and 19 in medullary tubular epithelia, but was intracellular at postnatal day 1. In support of these findings, functional expression of SvCT2, but not SvCT1 was observed in human embryonic kidney-derived HeK293 cells.

An injury of the epithelium requires a fast regenerative response. erman et al. (2013) investigated aspects of regeneration of the urothelium after chitosan-induced injury in an ex vivo system of side-by-side diffusion chambers. As a measure for a functional permeability barrier, they analyzed the high transepithelial electrical resistance (TeeR). Following a 20-min treatment with chitosan, a 60 % decrease in the TeeR was measured, leaky tight junctions were found and undifferentiated urothelial cells normally forming the basal layer of the urothelium were surface exposed. After about 200-min recovery, TeeR returned to normal and structural regeneration continued over the entire observation period of 350 min. Importantly, a rapid formation of functional tight junctions occurred in the ex vivo system preceding the terminal differentiation of umbrella cells. The ex vivo system of urinary bladder is proposed to represent a useful system to study aspects of regeneration. Mitsui and Hashitani (2013) performed an immunohistochemical study on the suburothelial microvasculature of mouse bladder. In their previous work, they observed that suburothelial venules, in contrast to arterioles, exhibit spontaneous phasic constrictions indicating their possible role in active drainage of the microcirculation. Here, they used wholemount bladder mucosal preparations immunostained for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. Suburothelial arterioles showed circular smooth muscle cells, whereas the venules, especially larger ones, displayed smooth muscle cells with a more complex morphology which formed a complex meshwork with processes extending from their cell bodies, e.g., stellate-shaped cells. In contrast to mouse bladder, the venules and arterioles of the rat bladder had circular smooth muscle cells. Additional studies on the innervation of mouse bladder submucosal venules and arterioles demonstrated that both were targets of sympathetic, cholinergic, and primary afferent nerve fibers.",

In mice, MAeL is a component of meiotic nuage, in which MAeL interacts with DDX4, MILI, and MIwI. MIwI proteins are critical for integrated localization of MAeL in male germ cells. various lines of evidence indicate that MAeL is essential for spermatogenesis and transposon repression in meiosis. In the present work, MAeL was localized by immunofluorescence microscopy in inter-mitochondrial cement, irregularly shaped perinuclear granules and satellite bodies of pachytene spermatocytes, and in chromatoid bodies of spermatids. The satellite bodies appeared exclusively in pachytene spermatocytes at stages IX-X and were strongly positive for MAeL. In step 12-19 spermatids, many granules stained for MAeL but not DDX4. By immunoelectron microscopy, these granules were confirmed to be nonnuage structures, such as mitochondria-associated granules, reticulated body and granulated body. In the neck region of late spermatids and sperm, MAeL-positive small granules were found. MAeL was colocalized with MIwI in nuage and non-nuage structures.

By in situ hybridization, spermatogonia showed a weak signal which gradually increased in intensity during their development.

Miyazaki et al. (2013) studied the importance of the polypeptide:N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 for spermatogenesis of mice.

In homozygous knockout mice, spermatozoa were not only rarely observed but also immotile and exhibited structural abnormalities of their heads. In addition, they had abnormal acrosomes and the arrangement of the mitochondria in the flagella was disturbed; this disturbance of acrosomal structures was due to inhibition of the fusion of proacrosomal vesicles into mature acrosomes. Additional analysis showed the expected drastically reduced O-glycosylation of acrosomal glycoproteins, in particular of equatorin.

(2013) have studied the possible role of nodal in the cattle reproductive process by analyzing its expression pattern and localization in the oviduct and uterine horn during the estrus cycle and early pregnancy. They were able to detect nodal both in oviduct and uterus during either the estrus cycle or pregnancy. However, nodal showed a differential expression profile in the uterine horn at diestrum and pregnancy, decreasing 1.5-and 1.4-fold, respectively, in comparison with estrus. Nodal immunostaining intensity was observed in stromal and in epithelial cells of the surface and the glandular epithelium. This first analysis of nodal in the bovine reproductive tract indicated that it may be involved in the remodeling occurring in the endometrium of cattle during the estrus cycle and in the embryo implantation, and as such may represent a predictor for successful pregnancy in cattle. Poon et al. (2013) investigated aspects of blastocyst implantation. Although the non-receptive uterine luminal epithelium is refractory to blastocyst invasion, this barrier is dismantled during implantation in an organized fashion to permit blastocyst attachment. The authors focused on claudin 7, a tight junction protein that in contrast to other members of the claudin family exhibits a distinct basolateral membrane localization, and investigated its localization, abundance, and hormonal regulation. Their results showed a distinct basal and lateral localization of claudin 7 in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelium throughout early pregnancy. On day 1, claudin 7 was abundantly present in response to ovarian estrogen, but at the time of implantation its abundance decreased independent of the presence of the blastocyst. The authors concluded that claudin 7 acts as an adhesion molecule that facilitates adhesion between adjacent uterine epithelial cells as well as between uterine epithelial cells and the underlying basal lamina. Furthermore, they suggest that the drastic reduction in claudin 7 as pregnancy progresses toward uterine receptivity for blastocyst implantation is a further contributor to the plasma membrane transformation, which sees uterine luminal epithelial cells detach from the underlying connective tissue.",
