However, Salmonella are also an important cause of sporadic food poisoning in developed countries. They are present in water, meat, dairy products, egg products and occasionally vegetables and fruits; they may survive partial cooking. 5 The discussion of Salmonella species is historically divided into typhoid and non-typhoid species. Patients with typhoid (enteric) fever, usually caused by Sa. typhi, typically present with fever that rises over several days, abdominal pain and headache. Abdominal rash ('rose spots'), delirium, hepatosplenomegaly and leukopenia are also fairly common. The diarrhoea, which begins in the second or third week of infection, is initially watery but may progress to severe gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation. Non-typhoid species (e.g. Sa. enteritidis, Sa. typhimurium, Sa. muenchen, Sa. anatum, Sa. paratyphi and Sa. give) generally cause a milder, often self-limited gastroenteritis with vomiting, nausea, fever and watery diarrhoea. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The infective dose is relatively low (approximately 10 2 )10 3 organisms may cause human disease). Although most Salmonella infections in developed countries resolve with antibiotics and supportive care, enteric infection may progress to septicaemia and death, particularly in the elderly, the very young or patients who are debilitated. Delayed treatment is associated with higher mortality. 12 Any level of the gastrointestinal tract may be affected, but the ileum, appendix and right colon are preferentially involved. The bowel wall is thickened, with raised nodules corresponding to hyperplastic Peyer patches. Apthoid ulcers overlying Peyer patches, linear ulcers, discoid ulcers or full thickness ulceration and necrosis often occur as disease progresses. Perforation and toxic megacolon may be seen, as can suppurative mesenteric lymphadenitis. Peyer patches become hyperplastic, followed by acute inflammation of the superficial overlying epithelium. Eventually the lymphoid follicles are infiltrated and obliterated by macrophages. The histiocyte is the predominant inflammatory cell in typhoid fever; admixed lymphocytes and plasma cells are seen, but neutrophils are typically not prominent. The ulcers are characteristically very deep, with the base at the muscularis propria.

The infective dose is very low (as few as 10-100 organisms in Sh. dysenteriae type 1). 16 Infants and small children, homosexual males and malnourished or debilitated patients are most commonly affected in developed countries. Like salmonellosis, the gross and microscopic features of shigellosis may mimic chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever and watery diarrhoea, followed by bloody diarrhoea that is often mucoid and \u2044 or purulent. Constitutional symptoms are common. 16, 17 Perforation and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome have been described. Most studies of mortality in shigellosis were performed in underdeveloped nations, and figures range from 2 to 10%. Mortality is significantly higher (> 20%) if patients develop sepsis. 16 The large bowel is typically affected (often the left colon most severely), but the ileum may also be involved. The mucosa is haemorrhagic, and variably ulcerated, sometimes with pseudomembranous exudates. 18 Early shigellosis has features of ASLC with cryptitis, crypt abscesses (often superficial) and ulceration. Apthoid ulcers similar to Crohn's disease are variably present. As disease continues, mucosal destruction develops with many neutrophils (as well as other inflammatory cells) in the lamina propria.

Yersinia have been found in chicken, fish, shellfish, swine, cattle, milk, ice cream, beef, lamb, poultry, pork, ham and water. 5 Infection with either species may cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea and symptoms and signs of appendicitis, enterocolitis or an acute abdomen. Associated mesenteric lymphadenopathy is frequent. Most infections are selflimited; however, immunocompromised and debilitated patients, as well as patients on deferoxamine or with iron overload, are at risk of more serious disease. 19 Yersinia preferentially involves the ileum, right colon and appendix. Grossly, involved bowel has a thickened, oedematous wall with nodular inflammatory masses centred around Peyer patches. Apthoid and linear ulcers may be present. Both suppurative and granulomatous patterns of inflammation can be seen, and a mixture of the two is common. [20] [21] [22] Recent studies have shown that there is significant overlap between the histological features of YE and YP infection and that either species may show lymphoid hyperplasia, epithelioid granulomas with prominent lymphoid cuffing (Figure 4) , transmural lymphoid aggregates, giant cells, mucosal ulceration, cryptitis and concomitant lymph node involvement. 20 Special stains are not helpful in the diagnosis of Yersinia, for the organisms are small, may be present in low numbers and are difficult to distinguish from normal non-pathogenic colonic flora. Culture, serological studies and PCR assays may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. 20,23 The major differential diagnoses for yersiniosis include other infectious processes, particularly Mycobacteria and Salmonella. Acidfast stains and culture results should help to distinguish mycobacterial infection; clinical features and the presence of greater numbers of neutrophils, microabscesses and granulomas may help to distinguish yersiniosis from salmonellosis. Crohn's disease and yersiniosis may be very difficult if not impossible to distinguish from one another histologically.

Many of these infections mimic other inflammatory gastrointestinal disease processes, such as ischaemic colitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. It is important for surgical pathologists to consider infectious agents in the differential diagnosis as they evaluate inflammatory lesions.
