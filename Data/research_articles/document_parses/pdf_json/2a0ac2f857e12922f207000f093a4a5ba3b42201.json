The pieces produced with 0.55 mm stepover presented higher values of flatness, as one can see in Table 1 . Also, the best deposition strategy to produce flatter cubic shapes has shown to be contour within the ones evaluated in this study; whilst chessboard with 0.55 mm stepover was the worst. When using wider stepover (0.55 mm) the melting pool is predominantly formed on the previous layer and a narrower strip of the adjacent bead is melted. Therefore, less powder might be captured by the pool, since it results wider. Such effect is probably aggravated at the borders and edges. When using narrower stepover (0.44 mm) the melting pool forms using a wider strip from the adjacent bead and has a wall left by it. Such melting pool might result more concentrated and deeper with more capacity to absorb powder and produce a flatter surface. Because the kinematic system in all CNC machines makes them slowdown in every corner and direction change, laser stays slightly longer time at those points. In linear, zigzag and chessboard strategies, slowdown points coincide with edges or corners repeatedly at the same layer. Those points received more heat and were kept at higher temperatures longer than others at the same layer. Such points probably experienced melting for more than once, which led to lower layer thickness and, consequently shorter than other points. Furthermore, at corners only approximately \u00bc of melt pool area is actually on the deposition area, reducing solidified volume at those particular points. With the contour (helical-like) strategy, heat is initially put at the center of the layer, which uniformly distributes it thought the preceding layer and to the argon flow. The melt pool is also disturbed by the powder and gas flow at the layers on the edge, but that happens just once at every layer.

Furthermore, it can be noticed the aspect on finishing, mainly on the contour strategy with 0.55 mm stepover, where it can be seen a deeper region between both pathways exactly on the corner. This is potentially due to the kinematic of the machine while performing corners, where it must stop one axis and start another at 90\u00b0.
