            "text": "Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is commonly estimated through the test-negative design (TND), an observational method that compares the odds of vaccination among influenza test-positive cases to influenza test-negative controls through the odds ratio (OR), with VE derived as (1-OR)x100%. The core prerequisite for valid VE estimation by TND is that vaccine has no effect on alternate etiologies of the same clinical syndrome included in the control group. Comparison of per-protocol and TND analyses of several large randomized-controlled trial (RCT) datasets involving >6000 participants has verified this prerequisite for influenza VE estimation, with the OR for influenza vaccine effect against non-influenza causes of influenza-like illness (ILI) approximating 1.0 (VE approximating zero) [1] .",

Cowling et.al. hypothesized such vaccine interference with infection-induced immunity to explain a significant four-fold increased NIRV risk among 69 children randomized to receive the 2008-09 influenza vaccine compared to 46 children receiving placebo [2] . That small RCT, however, included just 23 NIRV cases and was under-powered to show VE against influenza, as required by the interference hypothesis [2] . Conversely, in TND analysis of six study seasons (2004- [5, 6] . Three other coronaviruses have been associated with more severe illness including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and more recently SARS-CoV-2, the latter emerging in late 2019 and responsible for the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [5, 6] . Wolff's findings for seasonal coronaviruses, coincidentally published in January 2020, have triggered concern that influenza vaccination may detrimentally affect COVID-19 risk [4] . Here, we use historic datasets of the community-based Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) to assess the association between influenza vaccine and NIRV risk, notably seasonal coronaviruses.",

In the context of effective influenza vaccine, influenza cases would have lower likelihood of vaccination; as such, their inclusion would systematically reduce the proportion vaccinated in the control group and thereby inflate ORs comparing vaccine exposure between NIRV cases and controls. We illustrate the impact of this bias in Supplementary_Material_3, where we have re-analyzed Wolff's data as well as our own, comparing influenza vaccine effect against NIRV when influenza testpositive specimens are properly excluded (as per TND prerequisite) or improperly included (as per Wolff [4] ) within the control group.

NIRV detections included: EV/RV (645;25%); coronavirus (570; 22%); RSV (524; 20%); HMPV (390;15%); parainfluenza (316;12%); adenovirus (114;4%); and bocavirus (6;<1%). Coronavirus detections included: OC43 (230;40%); NL63 (112;20%); 229E (88;15%); 229E/NL63 combined targets (81;14%); HKU1 (53;9%); and 6 coronavirus co-infections. Median ages of influenza (35years), coronavirus (37years), and combined NIRV cases (34years) and their respective test-negative controls (36-37years) were similar. Among cases of influenza, coronavirus and combined NIRV outcomes, 27% (1165/4281), 20% (113/570) and 29%(751/2565), respectively, were children <20-years-old. The OR for influenza vaccination among influenza cases versus influenza test-negative controls was 0.55(95%CI=0.50-0.61), corresponding to a VE of 45%(95%CI=39-50%). ORs were similar when pan-negative (0.58[95%CI=0.52-0.65]) or NIRV-positive controls (0.51[95%CI=0.45-0.58]) were instead used and also similar when participants vaccinated<2weeks before ILI onset were considered unvaccinated as per Wolff[4] (0.56[95%CI=0.51-0.62])(Table_1). Conversely, influenza vaccine had no significant effect on any NIRV explored, separately or in combination(Table_1), including sensitivity analyses(Supplementary_Material_2",
