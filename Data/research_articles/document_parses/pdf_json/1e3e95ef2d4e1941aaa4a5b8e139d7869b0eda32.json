Jartti et al [21] reviewed studies that reported detection of viruses from asymptomatic adults and children, although some of the participants were household contacts of ill patients.

However, recent studies demonstrated that rhinovirus can replicate at higher temperatures and infect the lower respiratory tract [24] .
