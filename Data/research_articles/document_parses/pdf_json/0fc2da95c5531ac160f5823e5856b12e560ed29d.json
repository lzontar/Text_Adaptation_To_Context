Participants (n = 704) completed measures of individualism-collectivism, belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19, feelings of powerlessness, and intentions to engage in behaviours that reduce the spread of COVID-19. Results revealed that vertical individualism negatively predicted intentions to engage in social distancing, directly and indirectly through both belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and feelings of powerlessness. Vertical collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions directly. Horizontal collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions indirectly through feelings of powerlessness. Finally, horizontal collectivism positively predicted hygiene-related intentions both directly and indirectly through lower feelings of powerlessness. These findings suggest that promoting collectivism may be a way to increase engagement with efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. They also highlight the importance of examining the interplay between culture and both personal feelings (powerlessness) and information consumption (conspiracy theories) during times of crisis.",

Governments around the world have since taken unprecedented steps to mitigate the spread of the virus, such as encouraging social distancing and improving hygiene practices. Making these measures work is a significant challenge for governments (Tominey, 2020) . It is therefore important to understand what factors influence people's intentions to comply. Researchers have emphasized the importance of considering social psychological factors in attempts to limit the spread of COVID-19 (Van Bavel et al., 2020) . Drawing on social psychological expertise, advisory groups have specifically highlighted the role that cultural factors could play in people's intentions to engage with government instructions (SAGE, 2020) . In the current research, we examine the link between cultural orientation and people's intentions to engage in behaviours to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Research has consistently shown that collectivist (versus individualist) cultures demonstrate greater compliance and adherence to social norms (e.g., Kim et al., 1994) . In collectivist societies, it is ideal to meet social duties and obligations to maintain group harmony (Miller, Bersoff & Harwood, 1990) , whereas individualist societies tend to promote personal freedom over harmony (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) . These cultural orientations can also be measured at the level of the individualthat is, within a society some people have a more individualist (versus collectivist) orientation than others (Triandis & Singelis, 1998) . This is further broken down into vertical individualism (viewing the self as an autonomous individual who accepts inequality), horizontal individualism (viewing the self as an autonomous individual who prefers equality), vertical collectivism (viewing the self as part of a collective whilst accepting inequality), and horizontal collectivism (viewing the self as part of a collective that emphasizes equality; Singelis et al., 1995) .",

A sense of collectivism may improve people's attitudes towards actions that involve personal sacrifices. Supporting this idea, at the cultural level Gelfand et al. (2020) found that tighter cultures (considered more collectivist; e.g., Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea) have been able to contain the spread of the virus more efficiently and effectively than looser cultures (considered more individualist; e.g., the United States, Spain, and Italy).",

Although no research to date directly links belief in conspiracy theories to individualism or collectivism, there is much indirect evidence suggesting that they should be related. For example, the need for uniqueness, which is argued to be a central feature of individualism (e.g., Cai et al., 2018; Wang, Fan, & Ouyang, 2017) , consistently predicts conspiracy beliefs (Hart & Graether, 2018; Lantian et al., 2017) . Furthermore, individualists (versus collectivists) score higher on the Dark Triad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy; Wilson & Hartley, 2015) , and these traits also consistently predict conspiracy beliefs (Cichocka et al., 2015; Douglas & Sutton, 2011; March & Springer, 2019) .

For example, Xiang et al. found that individualism was positivelyand collectivism was negativelyrelated to feelings of powerlessness concerning climate change. This suggests that collectivists may garner feelings of power to overcome issues that require collective effort, whereas individualists may be less able to draw on such power. That is, collectivists may feel that they can rely on others to take action on global issues, making their own personal contribution in such cases more meaningful. Individualists, on the other hand, are less likely to feel empowered by collective support, ultimately making their own personal contribution feel less meaningful. Therefore, it is possible that feelings of powerlessness may help explain individualists' and collectivists' different responses to Research has also demonstrated that feelings of powerlessness predict health-related behaviours. For example, Jolley and Douglas (2014b) found that feelings of powerlessness mediated the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and lower vaccination intentions, a relationship they also demonstrated for climate-friendly behaviours (Jolley & Douglas, 2014a) . Feelings of powerlessness are therefore also likely to negatively influence people's responses to the pandemic. Drawing this research together, we therefore explore the possibility that individualists (versus collectivists) will show decreased compliance with COVID-19 mitigating activities as a consequence of heightened feelings of powerlessness.

Despite the large sample size and inclusion of 65 nationalities, almost 65% of the participants were either American or British. The study is therefore not internationally representative and does not allow us to test for cross-cultural or cross-national differences. Future research should access collectivist communities to increase the generalizability of these findings. It should also include a general measure of conspiracy belief, such as the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS; Brotherton, French, & Pickering, 2013) , in order to examine more general links between individualism-collectivism, conspiracy beliefs, powerlessness, and intentions. We also note that effect sizes in the current study were small, suggesting that many other factors influence the COVID-19 response. Furthermore, the literature requires experimental investigations of the indirect paths observed in our results (Van den Bos et al., 2014) . This would allow us to more stringently evaluate behavioural scientists' recommendation to promote collectivism (SAGE, 2020) as part of the COVID-19 response.",

Clearly communicating that 'we are all in this together' could be a fruitful endeavour in encouraging people to comply in this particular case and also during future crises. National leaders would also do well to follow this advice themselves and set an example for the general public. The current research also emphasizes the importance of examining the interplay between cultural factors and personal feelings (powerlessness) and information consumption (conspiracy theories) in this time of crisis. Finally, it raises the interesting possibility that during crises, collectivism encourages a powerful response, but individualism removes a sense of power and replaces it with potentially harmful conspiracy beliefs.",
