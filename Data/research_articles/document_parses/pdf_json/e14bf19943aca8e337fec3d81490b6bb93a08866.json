There is therefore a need to determine exactly why this increased risk occurs. An immediate policy response is required to ensure the health system is responsive to the needs of ethnic minority groups. This should include ensuring that health and care workforces, which often rely on workers from minority ethnic populations, have access to the necessary protective personal equipment (PPE) to ensure they can work safely. Timely communication of guidelines to reduce the risk of being exposed to the virus is also required in a range of languages. 29 Previous evidence suggests ethnic minorities in the UK tend to receive reasonably equitable care in many, but not all, areas. 30 However, this is not the case in many other countries (such as the US) where the adverse consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be even worse. SARS-CoV-2 therefore has the potential to substantially exacerbate ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in health 31 , unless steps are taken to mitigate these inequalities.
