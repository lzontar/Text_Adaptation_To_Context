The purpose of this study was to assess the psychosocial status of informal caregivers of community-dwelling adults over an eight-year period. Informal caregivers of adult care-recipients were identified from Wave 1 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) cohort. Multivariate regression analysis models were constructed to assess the association between participant's psychosocial characteristics and informal caregiving. Multilevel modelling explored the psychosocial changes between caregivers and non-caregivers over eight years. 1375 informal caregivers and 2750 age-matched non-caregivers were analyzed. Self-reported loneliness (Odd Ratio (OR): 0.26; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.01-0.51) and relationship status (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16-0.46) were independently associated with caregiving.

Previous studies have analyzed cross-sectional data [1, 3, 5] . This longitudinal assessment provides unique insights that there remains a difference that increases between caregivers and non-caregivers for a number of psychosocial variables. Furthermore, caregivers were not selected based on a specific illness or medical condition of the care-recipients. Previous evidence has frequently focused on examining informal caregiver outcomes for caregivers with specific diseases [8, 11, 19] . Accordingly, this analysis provides new insights to the wider community. However, there remains limitations which should be considered. Firstly, the ELSA cohort provides limited information on the care-recipient. Understanding the caregiving demand on physical or psychological, social, or a mixed support requirement is critical. This factor is important given that previous authors have highlighted greater strain and burden reported by caregivers when caring for people with cognitive impairment compared to people with less unpredictable behavioral challenges [36, 37] . Secondly, data were not available to analyze a number of variables which may have important contextual value, most notably whether participants lived in urban or rural communities. Thirdly, there remains limited indication on caregiver burden or the impact of family support. Given that caregiving dyad models have stressed the importance of the dyad on society (Social Ecological Model [15] ), which may fluctuate over time (Life Course Model [16] ) dependent on the care-recipient's needs, caregiver capabilities, and health and social care environment (Pearlin's Stress Process Model [17] ), consideration of these with further analyses would be value to explore how these variables interact with the caregiving scenario.
