KSHV is a member of the herpesvirus subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae, which also includes Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the first identified human oncovirus. Like all herpesviruses, assembly of an infectious KSHV virion starts at a bacte-riophage-like portal complex that putatively nucleates the formation of a T = 16 icosahedral capsid, which, at maturation, is composed of major capsid protein (MCP), small capsid protein (SCP), ab 2 heterotrimers of the Tri1 monomer and Tri2 dimer and is decorated by capsid-associated tegument complexes (CATCs) (Cardone et al., 2012) . Upon establishment of an initial procapsid, the portal facilitates the translocation of KSHV's $150-kb genome. This key process involves recruitment of an ATP-driven terminase (Yang et al., 2007; Heming et al., 2017) to the unique portal vertex to recognize, package, and cleave concatemeric viral double-stranded (ds)DNA, which, in conjunction with CATC's critical supporting roles (Heming et al., 2017) , give rise to viable genome-containing nucleocapsids (Adelman et al., 2001; Beard et al., 2002) . Unlike the comparatively high occupancies of capsid-associated tegument proteins in alphaherpesviruses Wang et al., 2018) and betaherpesviruses Yu et al., 2017) , KSHV CATC binding sites are markedly partially and/or more flexibly occupied, leading to poorly resolved CATC structures in prior icosahedral reconstructions of KSHV (Dai et al., 2014 . The CATC nonetheless plays a critical role in the release of a pleomorphic virion because the recruitment of outer tegument proteins and a glycoprotein-sporting envelope leading to virion egress depend on interactions of various viral proteins with constituents of the CATC (Owen et al., 2015; Sathish et al., 2012) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 87, "end": 107, "text": "(Chang et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 286, "end": 299, "text": "(Ganem, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 300, "end": 325, "text": "Giffin and Damania, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 871, "end": 893, "text": "(Cardone et al., 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1091, "text": "(Yang et al., 2007;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1112, "text": "Heming et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1300, "text": "(Heming et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1377, "text": "(Adelman et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1397, "text": "Beard et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1521, "text": "Wang et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1560, "text": "Yu et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1746, "text": "(Dai et al., 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2023, "end": 2042, "text": "(Owen et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2064, "text": "Sathish et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "In the absence of an in situ KSHV portal and CATC structures, how a single portal protein (pORF43) orchestrates the rise of a robust capsid and how order is maintained in the subsequently complex and variable processes of tegumentation and envelopment remains unknown.

Prior KSHV capsid reconstructions, although informative, have been calculated with icosahedral symmetry applied, obscuring non-icosahedrally related structures Trus et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2000) . Here we developed a workflow (Figures S1 and S2) to determine structures of the non-icosahedrally arranged components. This sub-particle data processing procedure, employing sequential localized classification with symmetry relaxation, allows stepwise reconstruction of selected regions of a viral particle. Briefly, two rounds of sub-particle classification were performed to relax icosahedral and local symmetries. In the first round, 12 ''subparticles'' of capsid vertices were extracted from each virion image using coordinates calculated from an initial icosahedral reconstruction of the virion particle. We then performed 3D classification with 5-fold symmetry applied to sort out the unique portal vertex sub-particle from the 11 penton vertex sub-particles for each virion image. Subsequent refinement yielded a 4.3-\u00c5 resolution reconstruction of the portal vertex with 5-fold (C5) symmetry (first visualized in HSV-1; McElwee et al., 2018) , revealing high-resolution structures of the capsid components surrounding the portal (Table 1 ; Figures S1, S2A, and S2D). A second round of sub-particle classification further relaxed C5 symmetry at the portal vertex, and subsequent refinement with C12 symmetry resulted in a 4.7-\u00c5 reconstruction, revealing high-resolution features of the dodecameric portal (Table 1; Fig- ures S1, S2A, and S2E). Using a specific orientation determined in our C12 classification, we then calculated an asymmetric (C1) reconstruction of the entire dsDNA-containing capsid at 7.6 \u00c5 (Table 1 ; Figures 1A, S1, S2B, and S2G; Video S1) and a C1 reconstruction of the portal vertex at 5.2 \u00c5 (Table 1 ; Figures 1B, S1, S2A, and S2F). Our C1 structures reveal concentrically packed layers of DNA with an inter-duplex distance of $25 \u00c5 , quasi-5-fold-organized capsid and tegument densities, a quasi-12-fold-symmetric portal dodecamer, and asymmetric terminal DNA within a DNA translocation channel capped by a distinctive density visible at lower thresholds (Figures 1A and 1B) .

We thus named the five domains of our pORF43 model in a fashion analogous to phage portal proteins: wing (aa 9-45 and 126-245), wall (aa 46-125 and 496-553), stem (aa 246-272 and 454-477), clip (aa 273-453 [aa 281-412 unmodeled] ), and b-hairpin (aa 478-495) ( Figure 1D ).

However, peripenton CATC densities in the KSHV icosahedral reconstruction were distinctively weaker than surrounding capsid proteins and only discernible when low-pass-filtered to $6-\u00c5 , suggesting low CATC occupancy and/or flexibility (Dai et al., 2014) ; in contrast, the HSV-1 icosahedral reconstruction indicated full CATC occupancy . Interestingly, our C1 reconstruction of the KSHV portal vertex reveals the presence of five CATC densities with a strength comparable with that of underlying capsid elements, indicating full occupancy of the five CATC registers surrounding the portal vertex. This preferred association of CATC with the portal vertex over the remaining 11 (penton) vertices suggests an important role of CATC at the portal vertex, to be discussed later. Our C1 reconstruction of the genome-containing capsid also indicates a curious binding pattern of CATCs to penton vertices in a manner dictated by the portal vertex. When displayed at a density threshold appropriate for capsid proteins, our C1 capsid reconstruction shows two adjacent (i.e., ortho) CATCs bound to each portal-proximal penton vertex, one CATC to each portaldistal penton vertex, and no visible CATCs at the portal-opposite penton vertex (Figure 2A ). Incrementally decreasing the density display threshold reveals additional CATCs of progressively weaker density (indicating progressively lower occupancies at those registers) manifesting at penton vertices in a ''portal-outward'' manner ( Figures 2B and S4 ). Importantly, within each penton vertex, CATCs appear to selectively bind registers on the portal side of a hypothetical ''equatorial'' bisecting the penton vertex, with a clear preference for the most portal-side register ( Figure S4 ). Adherence to this ''portal-side equatorial rule'' is exemplified by the observation that portal-proximal penton vertices (with two registers portal-side of the equatorial) max out at two CATC copies as the density display threshold is decreased, whereas portal-distal penton vertices (with three portal-side registers) max out at three CATC copies.

Thus, to accurately assess the specific occupancy of penton vertex CATCs and to understand the structural basis of a CATC's discriminatory association with portal and penton vertices, we relaxed 5-fold symmetry for penton vertex sub-particles and performed 3D focused classification of their CATC-binding registers ( Figure S1 ). Using a mask encompassing the region surrounding one CATC, four resulting classes were obtained. Although three classes clearly lacked CATC densities, one class contained a CATC density of a quality comparable with surrounding capsid protein densities ( Figure S1 ). 37.9% of masked sub-particles (i.e., 37.9% of penton vertex registers) were assigned to this CATC-binding class, slightly higher than the $30% occupancy estimated in our previous KSHV icosahedral study (Dai et al., 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1161, "end": 1179, "text": "(Dai et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 679, "end": 688, "text": "Figure S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 946, "end": 955, "text": "Figure S1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Resolving Symmetry Mismatches in the KSHV Capsid"}, {"text": "We further distinguished between possible CATC binding occupancies and permutations at the five registers of a single penton vertex using geometry-based sub-particle classification.

In agreement with trends observed in our C1 capsid reconstruction, penton vertices with two adjacent CATCs bound were most abundant (ortho-CATC-binding, at 38.6% of penton vertex sub-particles), followed by penton vertices with a single CATC bound (one-CATC-binding, at 21.9% of sub-particles). Five-CATC-binding penton vertices were rarest, as expected, at 0.2% of sub-particles because, barring deviations to the C1 capsid-observed consensus binding pattern, these should be limited to the portal-opposite vertices of highly bound capsids. Finally, we tallied the total number of penton CATCs in each capsid from our classified penton vertex sub-particles. The resulting histogram follows a sharp, slightly left-skewed Gaussian distribution peaking at approximately 23 penton CATCs per capsid ( Figure 3B ).

Side-by-side comparison of pORF32 and pUL17 models reveals similar core structures of separate N-and C-terminal b sheet-rich domains positioned beneath a central a helix-rich arch ( Figures  4G and 4H , orange).

Notably, pUL17's short helix bundle makes direct contact with the underlying triplex Ta, almost solely mediating CATC-Ta binding in HSV-1. In pORF32, nearly the entirety of this region is disordered and/or invisible in both portal and penton vertex reconstructions save for a 13-aa ''anchoring loop'' (AL; aa 220-232) ( Figure 4G , yellow).

Figures 4I and 4J ). Our models suggest that this rotation may be due to the steric specificity of pORF32's Ta-binding AL. Specifically, a 120 counterclockwise rotation of Ta exposes a deep groove running between the molecular boundaries of Tri1 and the Tri2A/B dimer that facilitates docking of pORF32's AL and, thus, CATC. Strikingly, despite CATCdecorated Ta's large degree of apical (i.e., main body) rotation, our structures show that Tri1's N-anchor-the characteristic N terminus of Tri1 subunits that penetrates the capsid floor-maintains a conserved orientation in the capsid interior at penton vertices regardless of Ta's apical orientation (and, by extension, regardless of CATC decoration) ( Figures 4I and 4J , respective insets).

Additionally, the aforementioned AL binds in Ta's deep hydrophobic cleft between Tri1 and the Tri2A/B dimer (Figures 5B-5D; Video S3).

(legend continued on next page) At the vertex-distal end of CATC, pORF32 sits atop, but does not directly bind to, triplex Tc. Instead, CATC-Tc interactions rely on the N-terminal tails of CATC's two pORF19 subunits, which extend distally from the helix bundle and descend beneath pORF32 to contact Tc (Figures 5A and 5F ). Contact with Tc occurs mainly via a short helical motif (aa 20-24) from the N-terminal tail of the ''upper'' (magenta) pORF19 subunit.

Our data showing that CATC-triplex Ta association correlates with a 120 apical rotation of Ta ( Figure 4I and 4J)-but not the 3-fold-related 240 , eliminating the possibility of this being a stochastic event-indicate that the determination of CATC binding (and, likely, binding of CATC itself or at least a subunit of CATC; Thurlow et al., 2006) occurs not long after procapsid formation, when the triplex's apical orientation has yet to be fixed by procapsid maturation. Procapsid maturation is concomitant with DNA packaging; head-full is likely sensed through capsid elements and relayed by the portal through the turret-like structure to the externally located terminase for cleavage of the concatemeric genome (Yang et al., 2007) , and the spring-loaded dsDNA genome is corked inside the capsid by the portal cap, putatively formed by five portal-adjacent CATCs ( Figure 1B) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 98, "end": 118, "text": "Newcomb et al., 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 268, "end": 290, "text": "(Newcomb et al., 1994;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 291, "end": 312, "text": "Perkins et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 313, "end": 332, "text": "Tatman et al., 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 438, "end": 457, "text": "(Deng et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 458, "end": 476, "text": "Zhou et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 726, "end": 745, "text": "(Deng et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1246, "text": "Thurlow et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1635, "text": "(Yang et al., 2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 997, "end": 1006, "text": "Figure 4I", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1780, "text": "Figure 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "CATC Binding Implications for Capsid Assembly and Diversity"}, {"text": "That capsid structures are rigidly symmetric reflects the capsid's well-defined and conserved role in packaging and protecting the viral genome, in marked contrast to both form and function of the largely pleomorphic tegument layer. Accordingly, all three sub-families of herpesviruses have highly conserved capsid proteins and structures but only partially conserved tegument and envelope proteins because these more often reflect specific host cell adaptations. Among tegument proteins, CATC is unique in possessing a structural role and, thus, being relatively conserved, but even so, a surprising finding here is that, unlike the full occupancy of CATC at capsid vertices in neurotropic HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Dai et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018) , CATC occupancy in KSHV at penton vertices is only partial and varies even among KSHV capsids (Figures 2 and 3) . That KSHV CATC occupancy appears to be dictated at least in part by the portal not only underscores the portal's aforementioned nucleation role but further spotlights its allosteric effect in defining an emergent first level of variability that, importantly, demarcates a departure from symmetry in KSHV metastructure. A second constructive level of variability is facilitated by pORF64, which accounts for two of the five subunits in CATC and is the largest tegument protein, with 2,635 residues folded into multiple domains joined by presumably flexible linkers (the vast majority of pORF64 is thus invisible in our structure). Some of these domains recruit other tegument proteins and bind the endodomains of envelope glycoproteins (Rozen et al., 2008; Sathish et al., 2012) , introducing pleomorphic variability. Last, the majority of tegument proteins, including pORF64, have been shown to be capable of being packaged into non-infectious virus-like vesicles in the absence of capsids (Gong et al., 2017) , suggesting an alternate pathway of tegument incorporation into virions independent of the capsid/CATC, implicating yet another level of assembly-driven variability.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 707, "end": 725, "text": "(Dai et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 726, "end": 744, "text": "Wang et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1615, "text": "(Rozen et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1637, "text": "Sathish et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1869, "text": "(Gong et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 840, "end": 857, "text": "(Figures 2 and 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "CATC Binding Implications for Capsid Assembly and Diversity"}, {"text": "In light of the tegument's primary role in manipulating host cells to facilitate virus replication, the multiple layers of structural variability at play in the tegument provide unique opportunities in the context of herpesvirus adaptability.

In essence, facing a relative lack of intraspecies genetic diversity (the tradeoff is more viable progeny), adaptability regarding the ability to manipulate hosts is, instead, implemented at a structural level.

Each orientation has three Euler angles denoted as parameters within the Relion star files: rot (_rlnAngleRot), tilt (_rlnAngleTilt), and psi (_rlnAnglePsi). We then defined the orientation for each of the twelve vertices from the 60 icosahedrally-related orientations as follows. First, we noted that because our icosahedral reconstruction was performed using I3 symmetry, there are 5 redundant orientations relative to each vertex that differ only in their rot angles (i.e., the in-plane rotation angle about the z axis). For this reason, we classified the 60 orientations into twelve groups each, with five orientations per group that differ only in their rot angles. We then randomly chose one of the five orientations in each group as the orientation of that vertex, thereby defining the orientations for all twelve vertices of each capsid.

Although the portal vertex lacks true 5-fold symmetry, this classification with 5-fold symmetry imposed successfully distinguished between penton and portal vertices. Through 50 iterations of 3D classification, four classes were ultimately generated, with one class in particular exhibiting markedly different structures (i.e., a blurry central channel with a rod-like density) ( Figure S1 ). Additionally, this class contained 7.9%, or approximately 1/12 th of the vertex sub-particles, consistent with the expectation that one out of twelve capsid vertices in each particle is a portal vertex. We thus considered this class the portal vertex class. In rare instances, two or more vertices from a capsid were classified into the portal vertex class, likely due to the low quality of these individual particles and/or errors in classification.

Moreover, in cases of two CATCs bound to a penton vertex, the two CATCs can either occupy registers adjacent to each other or registers with a gap (i.e., an empty register) in between. We named these two binding patterns ''ortho-CATC-binding'' and ''meta-CATC-binding,'' respectively. In instances of three CATCs bound to a penton vertex, the two vacant registers can either be adjacent or have a gap (i.e., an occupied register) between them, analogous to the case of two vertex-bound CATCs. We thus named these two permutations ''ortho-CATC-absent'' and ''meta-CATC-absent,'' respectively. Altogether, eight classes of penton vertices are possible.

Given that five expanded orientations for each vertex were already each assigned to either a CATC-binding or CATC-absent class (due to masked classification of the CATCbinding region), orientations for vertex sub-particles were determined as follows. The orientations for zero-and five-CATC-binding vertex sub-particles were randomly selected from their five orientations in the CATC-absent and CATC-binding classes, respectively. Orientations of one-CATC-binding and four-CATC-binding vertices were chosen as their single orientation in the CATC-binding and CATC-absent classes, respectively. Where each vertex bound two CATCs, orientations were chosen as one of the two orientations in the CATC-binding class, such that the second (i.e., non-chosen) orientation was a 72 and 144 counterclockwise rotation from the chosen orientation, for ortho-and meta-CATC-binding vertices, respectively. Similarly, the orientations for ortho-and meta-CATCabsent classes were chosen such that the non-chosen CATC-absent orientation was a 72 and 144 counterclockwise rotation from the assigned orientation, respectively. For all auto-refinements, sub-particle orientations were determined by local angular and offset searches about these selected orientations, and initial references were 30-\u00c5 reconstructions of the sub-particles generated by re-lion_reconstruct. 5-fold symmetry was imposed during refinements of zero-and five-CATC-binding vertices, while refinements of all other binding occupancies were carried out without symmetry. The resolutions of the resulting eight reconstructions determined by relion_postprocess according to gold-standard FSC at the 0.143 criterion were 5.8-\u00c5 , 4.7-\u00c5 , 6.9-\u00c5 , and 9.0-\u00c5 for zero-, one-, four-, and five-CATC-binding vertices, respectively; 4.1-\u00c5 and 5.3-\u00c5 for ortho-and meta-CATC-binding vertices, respectively; and 4.7-\u00c5 and 5.0-\u00c5 for ortho-and meta-CATC-absent vertices, respectively. As the orientation information of all CATC-binding and CATC-absent registers and vertex sub-particles were conserved in their respective header files in our workflow, we were able to trace each register and vertex back to their original particle image. This enabled us to conduct a survey of the global number of CATCs in each capsid and generate a histogram tallying this data (Figure 3B)", "authors": [{"first": "Yu", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "We then classified all penton vertex sub-particles into the eight classes as follows. We first noted that focused classification with expanded symmetry enabled us to determine whether the masked area of a penton vertex sub-particle (for each register) fell into a CATC-binding or CATC-absent class. We then counted the number of orientations (out of five symmetry-expanded orientations per sub-particle) assigned to the CATC-binding class for each penton vertex sub-particle. This counted number of orientations, ranging from zero to five, reflects the number of CATCs bound to that particular vertex in that viral particle. If two CATCs were determined to bind that vertex, the angle between the two CATC-binding orientations was calculated", "volume": "178", "issn": "", "pages": "1329--1343", "other_ids": {}}}, "ref_entries": {"FIGREF0": {"text": "In Situ Structure of the KSHV Portal and Its Interactions with Packaged DNA (A) Clipped view of KSHV C1 capsid reconstruction, showing packaged dsDNA within the capsid and unique portal vertex.

Refinement of the CATC-binding and CATC-absent structures without symmetry We next performed separate 3D auto-refinements without symmetry on both penton vertex sub-particles in the CATC-binding class and in the CATC-absent classes. Orientations for sub-particles were determined by local search around each sub-particle's predetermined orientation from the mask refinement. A 30-\u00c5 reconstruction of penton vertex obtained through relion_reconstruct was used as the initial reference for refinements. The final resolutions of the CATC-binding and CATC-absent reconstructions determined by relion_postprocess were 3.8-\u00c5 and 3.7-\u00c5 , respectively, according to gold-standard FSC at the 0.143 criterion (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003; Figure S2C ). Of note, because focused classification was performed with respect to the masked area, only structural features within the masked area (which encompasses one CATC and an associated triplex Ta) of the refined structure are genuine, while the other registers of CATC and triplex Ta are of mixed occupancy and/or conformations (Figure S1) (these will be fully separated in the following procedure).
