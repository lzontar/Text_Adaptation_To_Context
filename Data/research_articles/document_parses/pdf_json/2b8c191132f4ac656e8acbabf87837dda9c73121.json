About half of patients would have otherwise 26 presented to an ED or urgent care in-person. Virtual urgent care is an option for appropriate 27 patients while minimizing in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. In late 2019, a novel coronavirus disease , caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first 33 emerged in Wuhan, China. 1 The COVID-19 pandemic has since rapidly and aggressively 34 spread across the world, and New York City has emerged as a major global epicenter. 2 The 35 spread of the virus has challenged healthcare delivery and hospital-based care. 3, 4 National 36 shortages in personal protective equipment further strained patient care delivery in emergency 37 departments (EDs) and hospitals. 5 EDs in pandemic hotspots experienced high acuity patient 38 loads and severe boarding as hospitals struggled to manage patient placement and flow. 6 39 Primary care offices also declined to see patients with upper respiratory symptoms in their office 40 spaces for fear of infecting other patients, contributing to unmet patient needs. 41 42 To combat virus transmission and slow spread, many states have extensively implemented 43 social distancing and stay-at-home orders. Telehealth and virtual care were promoted as 44 solutions to deliver medical care while allowing for social distancing, and to help decrease 45 patient load on EDs. 7-9 Virtual and telehealth visits have been previously studied and found to 46 be effective for a wide application of medical scenarios, including dermatology visits, wound 47 care, psychiatric care or consultation, and infectious disease practice. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Telehealth care for 48 urgent and acute visits has also been well described. 15-18 49 50 Our institution has operated a Virtual Urgent Care (VUC) since 2017, staffed by emergency 51 physicians to treat nonemergent acute complaints, such as urinary tract infections, dermatologic 52 complaints, or upper respiratory infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic surge in New York 53 City, to provide care to patients seeking urgent care and to avoid in-person visits to busy EDs, 54 the program was rapidly scaled to deliver urgent care services to hundreds of patients daily via 55 a telehealth platform. Patients register for an available time slot on the VUC website, and 56 interact with a provider via an audio-video interface integrated into a patient-facing electronic 57 health record application. This study seeks to describe patient presentations to VUC in the 58 setting of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City; analyze patient demographics, including 59 geography; and consider the effect of a VUC option to decrease ED and in-person care 60 presentations. 61", "cite_spans": [{"start": 617, "end": 618, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 706, "end": 708, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 709, "end": 710, "text": "4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1745, "end": 1749, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1754, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1759, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1764, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1769, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1858, "text": "15-18 49 50", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions 24"}, {"text": "This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to our virtual urgent care 65 over a one-month period from March 8th, 2020 to April 7 th , 2020.

As in-person 166 urgent care centers within the network closed in early March, those physicians were also moved 167 online to provide additional virtual urgent care coverage during the study period. At the peak of 168 the study period, a total of 62 providers were available to see at least some patients daily via the 169 VUC platform, for a total of 364 provider-hours in that 24-hour period (March 25 th ).170 171 2,668 of the 17,730 patients seen in the study period (15.05%) responded to the online survey 172 at the time of visit completion. A total of 2,033 (81.16%) reported that they would have sought 173 care in-person had the VUC option been unavailable -either in an ED (11.86%), urgent care 174 center (37.49%), or via their primary care provider (31.82%). 18.84% of survey respondents 175 reported that they would not have sought care elsewhere (Figure 4).

Our results indicate that 189 the majority of patients seen during this period would have travelled to seek care in an ED, 190 urgent care center, or primary care office, had virtual urgent care video visit been unavailable to 191 them. These results are similar to previously published rates of alternative care destinations for 192 virtual acute care, in which 12% of patients indicated they would have presented to an ED and 193 33% would have presented to an urgent care center. 25 The overwhelming majority of patients 194 had symptoms concerning for potential COVID-19 infection (Table 2); a virtual urgent care video 195 visit allows for access to care while observing social distancing and quarantine provisions. 196 197 A number of studies have compared telemedicine based urgent care to in-person care. A 198 claims-based analysis of acute care telemedicine suggested that patients managed virtually had 199 a similar follow-up rate and lower rates of laboratory testing and imaging, with associated cost 200 savings. 15,26 During the current COVID-19 pandemic, with shelter in place ordinances access 201the nation, virtual on-demand care provides access to care but allows patients to remain in the 202 safety of their home. 9,11 Urgent care telemedicine visits have been estimated to result in short-203 term cost savings due to diversion of patients away from more expensive care settings.16,25  204    Overall, patient satisfaction results in our study indicated the majority of patients were both 205 satisfied and would use VUC again (Figure 5).
