A total of 18,354 mutations in S protein were analyzed and we discovered that most of these mutations could destabilize the entire S protein and its RBD.

These viruses are usually found in bats, birds, and mammals (1), but seven coronavirus members are found to infect humans. The paradigm shift in the mode of transmission of three pathogenic coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has resulted in recent outbreaks. The SARS-CoV epidemic began in Shunde, Guangdong, China, in November 2002. It ended in 2003 with more than 8000 cases in over 28 countries and ~800 deaths. The presence of a SARS-CoV-like coronavirus in bats indicated that the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV is horseshoe bat (2, 3). The MERS-CoV epidemic began in Saudi-Arabia in June 2012, and the transmission of MERS-CoV crossed the Arab peninsula to nearby countries. Scientists revealed that the Arabian camel (dromedaries) is the reservoir host to MERS-CoV, and they also spread the virus to humans. As of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 2,519 MERS-CoV cases in 27 countries and ~866 deaths. Although both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from animals to humans, human to human transmission was found plausible (2). The most recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The virus is closely related to the SARS-like CoV, RaTG13 virus which is found in bats (4). SARS-CoV-2 is so far the most pathogenic coronavirus.

The homotrimeric protein is responsible for mediating virus entry of SARS-CoV-2 via the Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell membrane (5, 6). Thus, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a high research priority for vaccine design against COVID-19. The S protein consists of an S1 and an S2 subunit. Proteolytic cleavage at the boundary of the S1 and S2 subunits is activated by the binding of the S1 subunit with the ACE2 receptor (5). The pairwise alignment of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV spike protein revealed a ~55% identity in the S1 subunits and ~91% identity in the S2 subunit (7). This subsequent disassociation allows for a conformation change in the S2 subunit that allows it to fuse with the SARS-CoV-infected cell membrane (8). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 includes a core and a receptor-binding motif (RBM) that specifically recognizes ACE2. The amino acid sequence similarities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the S protein, RBD, and RBM are 76%, 73% and 50%, respectively(9).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The interactions between RBD and ACE2 are critical for the host range and cross-species infections of SARS-CoV.

An investigation of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RBD had a significantly greater binding affinity to the human ACE2 (hACE2) and bat ACE2 receptors (11).

RBD is also the key determinant of cross-species and human-to-human transmissibility of SARS-CoV (13). The SARS-CoV S1 subunit is divided into the N-terminal domain and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD attaches to the peptidase domain of the ACE2 receptor via its RBM. Recent studies revealed the similar modes of SARS-Cov-2 S conformational states and RBD-ACE2 binding. A prefusion ectodomain trimer in the opened and closed conformational states of the SARS-COV-2 S was determined using the cryogenic-EM study (5) . In the open conformational state, SARS-CoV-2 S protein can recognize the ACE2 to initiate the viral entry. Crystallographic study showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD can bind hACE2 via its RBM (14). Want et al. were able to demonstrate through immunostaining that the CTD of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 co-localizes with the hACE2, demonstrating that this region contains the RBD that mediates the attachment of the virus to the host cell membrane (14). They demonstrated that 15 amino acids of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S1 established more atomic bonds with the hACE2 when compared to the crystallized structures of the RBD of SARS-CoV S1 in complex with the ACE2 receptor. These interface variations are thought to alter the affinity of the RBD for the ACE2 receptor. The ACE2 receptor consists of an N-terminal peptidase domain, a C-terminal Collectrin-like domain, a transmembrane helix, and an intracellular domain. The crystal structures of the ACE2 receptor in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1 showed that ACE2 forms homodimers mediated primarily by a ferredoxin-like fold domain, located between the peptidase domain and the transmembrane helix (15).

The in silico methods can readily quantify the effects of coding mutations on protein function and structure. A bioinformatics analysis based on the homology modelling of SARS-CoV-2 predicted that the mutations in the RBD region reduce the binding energy between the RBD and the ACE2 (10). However, a comprehensive effect map of SARS-CoV-2 S mutations still lacks for identifying the target sites for vaccine design. In-silico saturation mutagenesis provides a fast methodology to investigate all possible mutations and identify the potential functional sites. It has been applied to Mycobacterium research to determine the effects of missense mutations on thermostability, affinity, conformational changes and proteinprotein interaction (17) . The infection of SARS-CoV-2 in permissive cells is largely depending on the interaction of the viral S protein and ACE2.

SARS-Cov RBD residues G482 and F483 are in the equivalent positions of G496 and F497 of SARS-Cov-2 in the sequence and structure alignments ( Figure 6A and 6C ). All mutations in SARS-Cov RBD residue G482 can reduce the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity but the \u0394\u0394\u0394G values are relatively small compared with those changes in G496 of SARS-Cov-2.

Previous studies suggest that SARS-Cov-2 S protein has a higher RBD-ACE2 binding affinity compared to those of SARS-CoV S (5, 10, 14) .

Based on our calculations of folding energy changes, D614G has the minimum \u0394\u0394G at -0.7838 kcal/mol among all 19 possible mutations in this position (Figure 2 ). This suggests that G614 is the most stable form compared to other possible mutations.

As shown in Figure 1a, 31.3% mutations have strong effects (\u0394\u0394G > 2.5 kcal/mol) and 30.4% mutations have moderate effects (0.5 < \u0394\u0394G <= 2.5 kcal/mol) on protein destabilization. The heatmap of in Figure 2A also suggests that the most mutations can decrease SARS-CoV-2 full-length S protein stability. In contrast, only 0.2% mutations have strong effects (\u0394\u0394G < -2.5 kcal/mol) and 10.4% mutations have moderate effects (-2.5 <= \u0394\u0394G < -0.5 kcal/mol) on S protein stabilizing (Figure 1A). We also calculated the folding energy changes based on the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S in the closed state (PDB ID: 6vxx) and found that the results are highly correlated with those in the open state.

We calculated the folding energy changes of mutations in residues V1060 and L1061 of MERS-CoV wide type structure (Supplementary Figure S2).

Of 22 N-linked glycosylation sites, 15 sites could be mapped to fulllength S structure (Figure 7).
