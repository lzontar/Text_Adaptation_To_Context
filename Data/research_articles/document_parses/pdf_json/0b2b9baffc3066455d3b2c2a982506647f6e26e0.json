The daily distribution of the items is shown in Figure 1 . In January and February 2020 few papers appeared, followed by a considerable publication boost in March and April. Similar data were published by Kousha and Thelwall (2020) and Torres-Salinas (2020). About 20% of the papers have already assigned MeSH terms (Table 1) . The daily distribution of papers with MeSH terms (Figure 2) is more or less similar to that of all papers (compare Figure 2 and Figure 1) . Figure 3 shows that the cumulation of MeSH terms parallels the cumulation of MeSH papers. Both, Figure 2 and Figure 3 , indicate that the MeSH terms used to classify SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 papers may exhibit to some extent the knowledge accumulation and development around the pandemic. Tables 2 and 3 show the addition of (new) MeSH terms to indexed papers by day. Table 2 shows the numbers, Table 3 examples of the terms. Table 2 lists the dates and the number of publications with MeSH indexed as well as the numbers of new MeSH terms, i.e. MeSH terms which are not contained in the papers of the preceding dates. In Table 3 selected Medical Subject Headings are listed according to the sequence of their appearance from February to April 2020. The MeSH terms assigned to papers in the first half of February 2020 indicate the knowledge of a disease outbreak in China of pandemic proportions, caused by a betacoronavirus, and both, disease and virus, are already labelled (Table 3 ). The concomitant -possibly life-threatening -implications of the new disease, disease-spreading mechanisms, necessary diagnostic tools, assessment of especially vulnerable age groups, problems of health care systems, possible drug therapy schemes and other therapy approaches become evident using the information contained in MeSH terms assigned to papers published in subsequent days, weeks and months.
