This contrasting regulation of JE progression by CCR2 and CCL2 was coupled to central nervous system (CNS) infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes and Ly-6G hi granulocytes. There was also enhanced expression of CC and CXC chemokines in the CNS of CCL2-ablated mice, which appeared to induce CNS infiltration of these cell populations. However, our data revealed that contrasting regulation of JE in CCR2-and CCL2-ablated mice was unlikely to be mediated by innate natural killer and adaptive T-cell responses.

JEV poses an increasing threat to global health and welfare, with approximately 67, 900 cases reported annually. [1] [2] [3] JEV is now spreading to previously unaffected regions, such as Indonesia, Pakistan and northern Australia, due to rapid changes in climate and demography. 1, 2 Considerable progress in uncovering the pathogenesis of JE, acute neuroinflammation caused by JEV, has been made in infected patients and murine models. [4] [5] [6] The incubation period of JE ranges from 5 to 15 days and the disease is fatal in 25 to 30% of cases, 3 Hence, JE may have higher mortality than the acute neuroinflammation caused by infection with West Nile virus (WNV), which results in 3-5% mortality (1, 100 deaths/ 29, 000 symptomatic infections). 7 Although JEV is thought to infect and kill neurons directly in the central nervous system (CNS), CNS invasion by JEV induces activation of microglia/glia and infiltration of peripheral leucocytes. This leads to indirect neuronal killing via uncontrolled secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines [such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factora (TNF-a)] and soluble mediators that can induce neuronal death. 8, 9 Therefore, adequate CNS infiltration and activation of peripheral immune cells play an important role in protecting hosts from JE progression without tissue injury.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 355, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 360, "end": 363, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 519, "end": 521, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 522, "end": 523, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 677, "end": 680, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 681, "end": 684, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 685, "end": 688, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 790, "end": 791, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 990, "end": 991, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1409, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1411, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "During the progression of viral encephalitis, CNS trafficking of peripheral immune cells is mediated through a multistep process governed by chemokines and chemokine receptors. 10 Indeed, viral encephalitis caused by infection by flaviviruses including JEV and WNV is characterized by infiltration of peripheral leucocytes, such as monocytes and T cells, in the perivascular space and parenchyma. This can result in beneficial or detrimental outcomes, depending on the encephalitis context. [11] [12] [13] For example, infection of CCR5-deficient mice was uniformly fatal with drastically decreased infiltration of T cells and monocytes in the CNS following WNV infection. 14 A similar increase in susceptibility was observed in a homozygous individual with a complete loss-of-function mutation, CCR5D32. 15 Individual inhibition of CXCR3, CCR2 and CCR5 with corresponding antagonists also produced no changes in viral titre and survival following infection with virulent Semliki Forest virus, whereas simultaneous blockage of CXCR3 and CCR2 resulted in significantly reduced mortality in response to viral encephalitis caused by Semliki Forest virus, rather than an increase in mortality. 16 CCR2 is an extensively studied chemokine receptor that regulates the progression of viral encephalitis. CCR2 is considered critical to CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocyte trafficking and is thought to be expressed on subsets of activated T cells, dendritic cells and natural killer (NK) cells. 17 The primary and specific ligand for CCR2 is CCL2, but this receptor can also bind to CCL7 and CCL12/CCL13. 10, 17 Trafficking of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes governed by CCR2 appears to have a critical role during viral encephalitis such as WNV infection, 18, 19 although whether these cells function to protect or promote pathogenesis is unclear. Indeed, the CCR2-CCL2 axis can provide beneficial or detrimental results, depending on the context of immunopathological diseases caused by sterile and nonsterile stimuli. 10, 17 These various results mainly depend on the trafficking of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, which affects progression of neuroinflammation. Therefore, CCR2-deficient mice showed highly increased susceptibility to neuroinflammation caused by WNV infection with early decreased CNS infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, 18 whereas the recruitment of Ly-6C hi monocytes exacerbates intracerebral haemorrhage, depending on CCR2. 20 CCR2, but not its ligand CCL2, also exhibited an important role in regulating the progression of encephalitis caused by infection with coronavirus via an intracerebral route. 21, 22 Collectively, results indicate that the role of the CCR2-CCL2 axis in progression of viral encephalitis is complicated, depending on the context of the viral encephalitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 177, "end": 179, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 491, "end": 495, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 496, "end": 500, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 501, "end": 505, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 673, "end": 675, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 805, "end": 807, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1192, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1479, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1590, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1593, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1737, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1740, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1998, "end": 2001, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2004, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2323, "end": 2325, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2430, "end": 2432, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2608, "end": 2611, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2612, "end": 2614, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "CCL2 has also been detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients infected with JEV.

CNS infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes provides significant damage and destruction to the CNS in several models of CNS diseases, 31, 32 whereas CNS infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes plays an important role in conferring protection against neuroinflammation, such as WNV-induced encephalitis. 18, 22, 33, 34 Our results clearly favour the former notion because CCR2-ablated mice showed enhanced resistance to JE along with decreased CNS infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes, rather than high susceptibility to JE. In contrast, CCL2-ablated mice contained highly increased CNS infiltration by Ly-6C hi monocytes, resulting in markedly increased mortality following JEV infection. The role of CCR2 in regulating Ly-6C hi monocyte egression from BM has been critically demonstrated under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. 43, 44 Genetic ablation of CCR2 results in severe monocytopenia that provides partial or entire loss of these cells in inflamed tissues, as per the results demonstrated in this study.

CCR2 can bind to CCL7 and CCL12, as well as other chemokine receptors, such as CCR5 and CXCR3, which may participate in the infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes into the CNS. 10 In support of this, CCL7 and CCL12 expression was increased in the CNS of CCL2-ablated mice following JEV infection. Hence, these chemokines may be in part responsible for the enhanced CNS infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes in CCL2-ablated mice. Paradoxically, transgenic expression of CCL2 in the CNS is detrimental to CNS diseases caused by intracranial infection with coronavirus, rather than showing a beneficial role in progressing viral encephalitis. 51 Even though viral encephalitis is induced in CCL2 transgenic mice through a different virus strain and inoculation route, transgenic expression of CCL2 in the CNS provides ineffective clearance of the virus and a highly increased mortality, along with increased CNS infiltration of leucocytes. This fact may indicate that CNS infiltration of peripheral leucocytes is coupled to viral burden, no matter how the viral encephalitis is induced. Considering that CCL2 function appears redundant and can be replaced by the activity of other chemokines, 10, 17 it was interesting that lacking a single chemokine CCL2 drove the dramatic phenotype of progressing viral encephalitis caused by JEV.

Notably, CCL2 ablation appeared to provide more apparent accumulation of Ly-6G hi granulocytes in the blood and brain. In line with this finding, deficiencies of CCL2 and CCR2 were observed to induce infiltration of CD11b + Ly-6G hi granulocytes into inflamed tissues in a few disease models, such as herpetic stromal keratitis 46 and arthritis caused by Chikungunya virus. 52 Although Ly-6G hi granulocytes are a type of innate immune cell involved in immunopathology, their role in viral diseases such as viral encephalitis remains obscure. Because CD11b + Ly-6G hi granulocytes contain myeloid-derived suppressor cells that were recently described as a regulatory cell population in various inflammatory reactions, 53 it is possible that gradual increases in Ly-6G hi granulocytes are involved in the resolution of disease progression. In contrast, dominant infiltration of Ly-6G hi granulocytes could exacerbate diseases by preventing replacement of inflammatory monocytes with M2 macrophages that have high efferocytosis activity, as efferocytosis is a key driver of inflammation resolution. 54 Our results revealed that CCL2 ablation induces over-expression of CXCL2 (formerly called MIP-2), which is a strong chemoattractant for Ly-6G hi granulocytes. Conceivably, this over-expression of CXCL2 in the CNS of CCL2-ablated mice is secondary to CNS entry of the infectious virus from the periphery through Ly-6C hi monocytes. Therefore, CNS accumulation of CD11b + Ly-6G hi granulocytes in CCL2-ablated mice is probably a secondary phenomenon caused by overexpression of CXCL2 and depending on viral entry during JE progression. Ultimately, this dysregulated CNS accumulation of peripheral innate immune cells may exacerbate JE progression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 491, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 535, "end": 537, "text": "52", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 879, "end": 881, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1260, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another intriguing result in this study was that CNS infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes from peripheral sites is dominantly governed by CCL2 produced from HSCderived leucocytes, exacerbating JE progression. A similar study demonstrated the dominant role of CCL2 produced by HSC-derived leucocytes in recruiting Ly-6C hi monocytes into inflamed sites in mucosal infection with herpes simplex virus type 1. 55 CCL2 is secreted by a variety of cell types, including endothelial, fibroblast, epithelial, smooth muscle, mesangial, astrocytic, monocytic, and microglial cells, either constitutively or after induction by oxidative stress, cytokines, or growth factors. 41 CCL2 production can also be induced by stimulation with type IFNs (IFN-I) alone through an IFN-responsive element in the CCL2 upstream promoter. 56 Hence, pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN-I produced by a facilitated inflammatory reaction in the CNS of CCL2-ablated recipients could affect peripheral leucocytes derived from HSCs. This promotes CCL2 production by HSC-derived leucocytes and subsequently facilitates recruitment of Ly-6C hi monocytes to the CNS. This speculation is based on results that decipher the detailed pathway to establish orchestrated mobilization of Ly-6C hi monocytes through CCL2 produced from HSCderived leucocytes. 55 However, it was interesting that CCL2 produced from tissue-resident cells in the CNS restrict the progression of JE because WT recipients of CCL2 KO BM donor cells (KO-WT) exhibited comparable resistance with the WT-WT BM chimeric model. Considering that CCL2 produced by resident microglia and glia cells causes the recruitment of TNF-and inducible nitric oxide synthaseexpressing macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells, 57 it is likely that CCL2 produced by resident cells may contribute to control viral dissemination in the CNS. Collectively, although the detailed role of CCL2 produced from HSCderived leucocytes in CNS recruitment of Ly-6C hi monocytes remains to be defined, our results provide insights into the role of CCL2 produced from HSC-derived leucocytes in exacerbating JE progression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 811, "end": 813, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1314, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1740, "text": "57", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Enhanced production of IFN-c by NK cells and antigen-specific Th1 CD4 + T cells is believed to play a role in controlling viral replication in extraneural tissues and the CNS during JE. 35, 36 In addition, the cytolytic function of infected target cells by antigen-specific CD8 + T cells is thought to play a crucial role in recovery from JE. 37 Our data are inconsistent with these notions because CCR2ablated mice that showed enhanced resistance to JE displayed reduced responses of NK and antigen-specific CD4 + CD8 + T cells. Although we did not define why CCR2-ablated mice exhibited reduced T-cell responses, such reduced adaptive T-cell responses may be derived from decreased antigen burden in CCR2-ablated mice. Because NK-cell-depleted mice show changes in viral burden or survival, 58 our data support that NK cell responses do not significantly contribute to host survival. This notion is also consistent with the absence of a protective role of NK cells and immune escape from NK cell attack by up-regulation of MHC I in flavivirus infection models. 59, 60 Therefore, it is unlikely that IFN-c production and cytolytic function by NK cells is dominant in regulating JE progression. Adaptive CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses, which require time to develop, are also unlikely to play a role in regulating early viral replication in extraneural and neural tissues. In general, infected CCR2 KO and CCL2 KO mice began showing neurological signs, including paresis and rigidity, from 4 dpi before protective adaptive immune responses are developed. Hence, mice surviving at 7 dpi were used to determine adaptive CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses specific for JEV antigen. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the contrasting susceptibility of CCR2-and CCL2-ablated mice to JE progression probably depends on CNS infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes. However, our data did not provide defined results indicating how the ablation of a single chemokine CCL2 induced highly increased expression of CXC and CC chemokines in the CNS, resulting in CNS infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes and enhanced susceptibility to JE. Although our data showed that CCL2 produced from HSC-derived leucocytes plays an important role in CNS infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes, the detailed cascade pathway to induce CNS infiltration of Ly-6C hi monocytes in CCL2-ablated mice remains to be investigated at the molecular and cellular levels.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 189, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start":
