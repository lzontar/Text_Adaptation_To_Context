Coronaviruses are so-named due to characteristic 'crown-like' projections visible on electron microscopy. Coronaviruses are subdivided into four genera (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and typically infect birds and mammals. Seven species in the alpha-and beta-coronavirus genera are known to cause human disease from animal-to-human spillover. Other notable disease outbreaks have been caused by coronaviridae including SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012-ongoing. 1 Understanding of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete, although it appears to share similar transmission characteristics as SARS-CoV-1. 2 Human-to-human transmission is thought to occur predominantly via droplets; transmission via fomites is especially relevant as the virus has been shown to be viable for up to 48-72 h on plastic and steel surfaces. 2 Many health services are also assuming airborne precautions, particularly for aerosolised procedures, due to the uncertainty and rapid spread. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols for around 3 h. 2 Detection of the virus in stool samples of COVID-19 patients may suggest potential faecal-oral transmission or asymptomatic shedding in faeces. 3 It may also persist on human hair.
