The XRD patterns in Fig.1a were indexed as Cu and CrB2 phases, while patterns in Fig. 1b were indexed as Cu and CrB. Hence, by adjusting the ratio between borax and CuCr in the reactants, the in-situ particles can form as CrB2 or CrB. It should be noted that borax was more than the theoretically needed amount to compensate for the evaporation loss during synthesis (Na2B4O7 melting point 743\u2103). The in-situ reactions are shown in Reaction 3 and 4. At 1300\u2103, Cu-6.5wt.% Cr is in the single-phase liquid zone according to the Cu-Cr phase diagram. Al, acting as reductant, reduces B from borax to ground state (Reaction 3 [12] ). The high activity B atoms will diffuse into molten CuCr and react with Cr atoms in the CuCr solution (Reaction 4), forming chromium borides with different stoichiometries depending on the relative Cr and B contents. Fig. 1c shows the XRD patterns of the in-situ sample using KBF4 and CrF3 as B and Cr sources. The phases were identified as Cu and CrB. The underlying reactions are as follows. Al reacts with KBF4 and CrF3 at the molten salt/molten metal interface, reducing B and Cr from KBF4 and CrF3 to ground states, respectively, according to Reaction 5 and 6. The high activity Cr and B will immediately react and form CrBx via Reaction 4 at the interface, unlike in 3.1.1 where CrBx was formed in the molten metal. The formed CrBx particles will spontaneously migrate into molten Cu instead of the molten salt to reduce the interfacial energy, as CrBx has a better wettability with molten Cu than with molten salt [2, 13] . In this study, although the Cr:B ratio was designed to be 1:2, the final product was CrB due to the more severe evaporation of KBF4 than CrF3 at high temperatures. Thus, to produce in-situ CrBx with an intended stoichiometry, the KBF4 salt should be more than the theoretical amount.

The fractions of particles smaller than 1 \u03bcm in Fig. 5b and 5c are also smaller than those in Fig.  5a . It is thus anticipated that, with borax-CuCr as precursors, the more severe coalescence of particles (smaller than 1 \u03bcm) leads to the two-peak pattern, with increased number fractions of particles larger than 5 \u03bcm. Therefore, KBF4-CrF3 is superior to borax-CuCr as precursors, regarding producing smaller insitu CrBx particles. Systematic studies of the effects of temperature, reaction time, precursor type, and reactant concentration on particle sizes will be investigated to optimize the synthesis results and to achieve better properties.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 134, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 449, "end": 463, "text": "Fig. 5b and 5c", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 495, "end": 503, "text": "Fig.  5a", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Comparison of In-Situ CrBx Particle Sizes"}, {"text": "Microhardness of the in-situ Cu/CrBx is shown in Table 1 .

Compared to pure Cu (C10100, M20) [14] , the hardness of the Cu containing in-situ CrBx particles is significantly enhanced.

Thus, CrB is stronger than CrB2, which is expected to induce higher strengthening effects in Cu. The residual Al contents in the in-situ samples are also shown in Table 1 .
