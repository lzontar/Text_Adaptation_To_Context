            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 is a homolog of the well-characterized plasma membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme. ACE2 is thought to play a critical role in regulating heart function, and in 2003, ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We have recently shown that like ACE, ACE2 undergoes ectodomain shedding and that this shedding event is up-regulated by phorbol esters. In the present study, we used gel shift assays to demonstrate that calmodulin, an intracellular calcium-binding protein implicated in the regulation of other ectodomain shedding events, binds a 16-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 762-777 within the cytoplasmic domain of human ACE2, forming a calcium-dependent calmodulin-peptide complex. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ACE2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells specifically binds to glutathione-S-transferase-calmodulin, but not glutathione-S-transferase alone, in pull-down assays using cell lysates. Finally, to investigate whether calmodulin has any effect on ACE2 ectodomain shedding in cells that endogenously express the enzyme, cells from a human liver cell line (Huh-7) expressing ACE2 were incubated with calmodulin-specific inhibitors, trifluoperazine and calmidazolium. Both trifluoperazine (25 mol/liter) and calmidazolium, (25 mol/liter) significantly increased the release of ACE2 into the medium (44.1 \u03ee 10.8%, P \u03fd 0.05, Student's t test; unpaired, two-tailed, and 51.1 \u03ee 7.4% P \u03fd 0.05, one-way ANOVA, respectively;), as analyzed by an ACE2-specific quenched fluorescence substrate assay. We also show that the calmodulin-specific inhibitor-stimulated shedding of ACE2 is independent from phorbol ester-induced shedding. In summary, we have demonstrated that calmodulin is able to bind ACE2 and suggest that the ACE2 ectodomain shedding and/or sheddase(s) activation regulated by calmodulin is independent from the phorbol ester-induced shedding.

            "text": "S ince the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 (1, 2), there have been numerous studies aimed at both characterizing the enzyme and defining its precise physiological roles. These studies have shown that ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase able to efficiently hydrolyze the vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) into Ang 1-7, both in vitro (1, 2) and in vivo (3) , suggesting its involvement in the renin-angio-tensin system and cardiovascular regulation. More significantly, ACE2, which is normally expressed at low levels in tissues such as the heart, is up-regulated in the failing human heart as well as in rat models of myocardial infarction (4) along with an increase in the level of Ang 1-7 formation (5) . This suggests that ACE2 likely counteracts the functions of its homolog ACE by inactivating Ang II with the resultant production of the putative va-sodilatory peptide Ang 1-7. Apart from its implicated role in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 also appears to play a protective role in mice suffering from severe acute lung injury (6) .",

Ectodomain shedding may thus represent a fundamental process allowing this enzyme to act not only locally but also systemically in the circulation. Alternatively, shedding may be a way of rapidly down-regulating enzyme activity in the vicinity of its site of expression as an alternative to internalizing the enzyme. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of ACE2 ectodomain shedding is poorly understood and may involve one or more regulatory endodomains and/or the juxtamembrane region to initiate the recruitment of sheddase(s) to the membrane for the cleavage-secretion event to occur.",

Recently Lambert et al. (13) reported the interaction between CaM and ACE2 and that CaM is able to inhibit ACE2 ectodomain shedding. In the present study, we sought to determine how CaM modulates ACE2 shedding, and we show the formation of complexes between CaM and peptides mimicking a region in the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 and provide evidence that CaM inhibition that increases ACE2 ectodomain shedding is independent from stimulated shedding by phorbol ester.",

Analysis of the concentrated medium from cells treated with CaM-specific inhibitors showed a significant increase in soluble ACE2 activity compared with control medium (Fig. 4) . In cells that were treated with trifluoperazine (25 mol/ liter), a 44.1 \u03ee 10.8% increase (P \u03fd 0.05 Student's t tests; unpaired, two tailed) in ACE2 activity after 16 h incubation was observed (Fig. 4A) .

As demonstrated previously (8) , PMA is able to stimulate ACE2 shedding (92.3 \u03ee 5.3%). The increase in ACE2 activity in the medium after CaM inhibitor treatments suggests that that CaM plays a role in the cleavage secretion of the ACE2 ectodomain.

            "text": "The recent discovery of CaM involvement in the phosphorylation of ACE (27) and the ectodomain shedding of both ACE and ACE2 (13, 27) led us to look into the mechanism of how CaM regulates ACE2 ectodomain shedding. Interestingly, the CaM-binding site identified in ACE2 is structurally very different from the CaM binding motif identified for ACE; thus, the mechanism by which calmodulin regulates ACE2 shedding also must be very different; this is not entirely surprising, given that the homology between ACE and ACE2 resides primarily in the extracellular domain (2) . Apart from ACE, CaM is known to bind to a number of other membrane-bound proteins that are shed from the cell surface. In a previous study, we showed that CaM binds the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic sequences of the platelet membrane glycoprotein GPVI (12) . Similarly, CaM was shown to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin (10) . The juxtamembrane cytoplasmic sequence of ACE2 is homologous to membrane-proximal sequences of GPVI and L-selectin ( Fig.  1 ), which were both previously shown to bind CaM (10, 11) . This sequence similarity suggests, and our results confirm, that CaM is able to bind to the proposed CaM-binding region of ACE2 (13) . Study of the interaction between CaM and a synthetic peptide analog of the putative CaM-binding site in ACE2 demonstrated that these proteins associate at a 1:2.5 molar ratio, within the range of values reported for other CaM-binding peptides in gel shift assays (11, 20 -22) . One of the common characteristics for CaM binding motifs in its target proteins is a conserved region of positively charged amino acids, which often is predicted to form amphipathic \u2423-helices (28, 29) . The design of the peptide variants illustrated in Fig. 1 was based on the hypothesis that the charged residues in the wild-type sequence will form an amphipathic \u2423-helical structure. However, none of the peptides, including the wild-type sequence, adopted any defined conformations when analyzed by circular dichroism (data not shown). This indicates that the binding of CaM to the peptides is based on the amino acid sequence rather than the structural characteristic of the region.",

            "text": "CaM plays a pivotal role in the regulation of signal transduction for many biological processes, including regulating the function of integral membrane proteins (30, 31) . The presence of a putative CaM binding site in ACE2 may thus indicate the involvement of CaM in the regulation of this membrane-bound carboxypeptidase. CaMis are often used to investigate the association of CaM and membrane-bound proteins. In this study, we observed a significant increase in ACE2 activity in the medium when Huh-7 cells, which endogenously express ACE2, were incubated with CaMi. This finding is consistent with studies of other cell surface molecules in which CaMi treatment stimulated ectodomain shedding. A previous study of the receptor tyrosine kinase (TrkA) showed that the ectodomain of this integral membrane protein can be shed by PMA and CaMi (32) . PMA activates the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, leading to increased cleavage-secretion of many membrane proteins, including ACE2 (33) . In contrast, CaMi-induced ectodomain shedding of TrkA was reported to be independent of PKC activity, indicating that CaMi and PMA mediate cleavage-secretion by two distinctive signaling pathways (32) . CaMi-induced shedding was also observed for other cell surface molecules such the adhesion molecule CD44 and the membrane-anchored precursor for TGF-\u2423 (pro-TGF-\u2423) (34, 35) . Two different sheddases, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM)-10 and ADAM17, have been reported to cause ectodomain shedding of CD44 by CaMi and PMA, respectively (34, 35) , whereas CaMI and PMA were shown to mediate pro-TGF-\u2423 shedding through two distinctive signal transduction mechanisms (34, 35) . We previously reported that the ectodomain shedding of ACE2 was stimulated by PMA, which could be inhibited using both ADAM17-specific inhibitors and small interfering RNA technology (8) . These results suggest that ADAM17 is involved in the regulated, but not constitutive, shedding of ACE2 (8) . Although the sheddase(s) involved in ACE2 shedding regulated by CaMi is not known, we propose that the mechanism of activation for ACE2 ectodomain shedding by CaMi differs from that affected by phorbol ester. Our findings demonstrated that CaMi-induced shedding were unaffected by the inhibition of PKC pathway.",

Wang Abdel-Rahman (38) demonstrated that, although the level of CaM remained unchanged in the diseased liver, the binding of CaM to eNOS significantly decreased. Similarly, in one of our recent studies (39), we reported that ACE2 expression is significantly up-regulated in human and rat liver after chronic liver injury. Although the direct association of CaM and ACE2 in the liver has yet to be investigated, it is possible that, like eNOS, CaM binding to the overexpressed ACE2 may be reduced in the liver, ultimately leading to an increase in ACE2 secretion. In diseased tissues such as the heart and liver, an increase in secreted ACE2 could counteract the effect of increased Ang II production caused by other overexpressed components in the reninangiotensin system (40, 41) .",

The ectodomain shedding of ACE2 is potentially an important mechanism by which local ACE2 activity can be regulated. In addition, the shedding of ACE2 may represent a mechanism by which viral entry and infection may be controlled (e.g. SARS-CoV). Our studies demonstrate that CaM binds to a peptide mimetic of ACE2 cytoplasmic tail, and we show that CaMi-and PMA-induced shedding of ACE2 ectodomain occur via two independent mechanisms by which the ACE2 sheddase(s) may be activated. This finding provides valuable information about ACE2 shedding as well as identifying potential intracellular targets for the pharmacological and therapeutic regulation of ACE2. ",
