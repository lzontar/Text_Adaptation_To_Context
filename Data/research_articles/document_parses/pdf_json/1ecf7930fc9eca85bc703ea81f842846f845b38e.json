Methods Clinical data were collected from critical infants with EV71 infection. The infants were grouped into PE, non-PE, and control groups. The control group included infants in the preoperative period of elective inguinal hernia surgery. Biochemical changes in PE fluid were evaluated, and Ang-2 levels in serum and PE fluid were measured. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were incubated with serum from the control and PE groups and human recombinant Ang-2 or serum from the PE group and human recombinant Ang-1, and changes in the intercellular junctions were recorded via immunofluorescence. Results Of the 161 infants with critical EV71 infection admitted to the hospital, 39 had PE. PE fluid was collected from 18 of these infants. The PE fluid-to-serum (P/S) ratio of total protein was 0.9\u00b10.2, and all P/S ratios of albumin were 1.0\u00b10.3.
