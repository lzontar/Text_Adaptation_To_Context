Autocratic tendencies have appeared in democratic countries such as Russia, Turkey, Hungary and Poland, to name a few. 2 A key question is whether China, the biggest country in the world with miraculous growth over the last four decades, will evolve towards democracy. So far, to put it mildly, little evidence points in that direction. Reasons thus can be found for being skeptical that countries should all become democratic as they develop economically.

A key difference between those cultural types is that a collectivist culture creates stronger pressure towards conformity and stronger aversion for radical institutional innovation. We show that, starting from an initial situation of autocracy, a collectivist society is less likely to adopt a democratic regime than an individualistic society, irrespective of whether a collectivist culture may be more effective in overcoming collective action problems. In our model, collectivist societies often end up in equilibrium having a \"good\" autocracy, i.e., an autocracy that does not act in a predatory way toward its citizens because good autocracies tend not to be overthrown by collectivist societies, unlike those of individualistic societies. That outcome occurs because of the stronger aversion for radical institutional innovation in collectivist societies. Furthermore, if political institutions can influence culture over time, our central prediction continues to hold: collectivist societies are less likely to end up with democracy. Note that those results do not follow automatically from a congruence between individualistic values and democracy. Countries with individualistic cultures must still overcome collective action problems to transition from autocracy to democracy, which is a non-trivial barrier. Indeed, we do observe countries with relatively high individualism scores and low democracy scores (e.g., Morocco). Yet, a striking result of our model is that even if one assumes that the collective action problem is much more acute in individualistic societies, such societies are still more likely to end up with democracy over time than collectivist societies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We test the predictions of the model empirically, using the well-known Hofstede measure of individualism-collectivism. We find a strong and robust effect of individualism on average polity scores between 1980 and 2010. A one standard deviation increase in the individualism score is associated with as much as a four-point increase in polity scores, a large magnitude. That result holds even when we control for all of the variables that have been used in the literature on democratization, including measures of economic development. We also document evidence that countries with collectivist cultures experience autocratic breakdowns more frequently, suggesting less collective action failure in collectivist cultures. We do find strong evidence that in collectivist cultures, conditional on autocratic breakdown, transition to autocracy is more likely while in individualistic cultures, transition to democracy is more likely. While the main result is tested using the well-known polity data, those last results are tested using the new data on autocracies and autocratic transitions assembled by Geddes et al. (2014) .

That variable has been argued (see, e.g., Fincher et al. 2008; Murray and Schaller 2010) to have a direct effect on the choice of collectivist culture as stronger pathogen prevalence created better survival prospects for communities that adopted more collectivist values, imposing stronger limits on individualistic behavior, being less open to foreigners and placing strong emphasis on tradition and stability of social norms. The second instrumental variable is a measure of genetic distance between countries based on differences in cross-sectional frequencies of blood types. That instrument is adopted as a proxy for vertical cultural transmission from parents to children. Since the genetic pool evolves relatively slowly and it is unlikely that neutral genetic markers (e.g., blood types) changed since the industrial revolution, one can use genetic distance in terms of such markers to instrument cultural differences. 3 Because of the pitfalls related to cross-country regressions, we must be careful in interpreting the instrumental variable regression results as causal.

Since Lipset's (1959) seminal work, a large literature, both theoretical and empirical, has been devoted to understanding the determinants of democratization. Lipset emphasized the role of economic development and, thus, not surprisingly, most disputes on democratization have been about whether economic development is a fundamental determinant of democracy. Lipset was taking a broad view of economic and social modernization creating conditions for increases in the demand for democracy. In recent years, debates about the importance of economic development have been revived after the work of Przeworski and Limongi (1997) . Using data between 1950 and 1990 for 135 countries, they showed that the correlation between income and democracy was explained not so much by economic development leading to democratization, but rather by the fact that once countries have achieved a certain level of economic development, they usually never revert to authoritarian regimes. Countries could opt for democratic or dictatorial regimes for reasons that are unrelated to economic development, but if richer countries develop stable democracies, one will see a strong correlation between income per capita and democracy. 4 Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) argued that democratization mostly was an elite strategy to commit to redistributive transfers in response to revolutionary threats. 5 Some of the recent studies question causation from development to democracy or even the correlation between the two. Acemoglu et al. (2005 Acemoglu et al. ( , 2008 showed that the relationship between income (or education) and democracy, mainly is a feature of cross-sectional data and that when performing panel data analysis, one ceases to find a significant relationship between those variables. 6 Acemoglu et al. (2014) in recent work even found that democracy affects growth, a conclusion opposite to that of modernization theory. On the other hand, Boix and Stokes (2003) found that by taking data far enough into the past (to the second half of the nineteenth century), one can recover a significant relation between income per capita and democracy.

Inglehart (2002) and, more recently, Inglehart and Weizel (2005) , using the World Values Survey, argued that modernization leads to changes in values towards more self-expression and stronger emphasis on individual liberty. 7 According to them, those changes in values underlie stronger support for democracy. Their study is the closest to ours because the values they emphasize are close to individualism as we define it (more on that below). However, their focus is not the effect of culture on democracy. Instead, they emphasize cultural changes brought about by modernization. Our approach is different: we take culture as slow-moving (Roland 2004) , 8 thus potentially 7 See also Putnam et al. (1994) on how a strong culture of civil engagement affects the quality of government. 8 A large empirical literature shows that culture has a very strong inertia, from research showing the longrun effects of cultural differences between groups of early US settlers (see Fischer 1989; Grosjean 2014) to research showing the persistence of culture of ancestors' countries of origin among US immigrants (see, e.g., Guiso et al. 2006; Tabellini 2008; Algan and Cahuc 2010) . 4 Persson and Tabellini (2009) specified a theoretical model and showed empirical support for a theory of positive feedback between the capital stock of democratic experience and economic development. Persson (2005) showed that the form of democracy mattered for income growth: the introduction of parliamentary democracy with proportional electoral rules produced the most growth-promoting policies. 5 Bruckner and Ciccone (2011) found that transitory negative income shocks related to drought have a positive effect on democratization in Sub-Saharan Africa. 6 Grosjean and Senik (2011) found no link between income and support for democracy in the context of transition countries. affecting faster-moving variables, such as political institutions. We do not deny that culture may be affected by political institutions and other variables, which is why we try to isolate the effect of culture on political institutions by adopting an instrumental variables method. While our research suggests that individualism affects both income per capita and democracy, we do not rule out a separate effect of income on democracy. Furthermore, we document that, in contrast to other measures of culture (e.g., religion, trust), individualism is a robust predictor of democracy.

Our assumptions represent a clear simplification of reality. 9 We assume that a good autocrat does not tax or redistribute. That assumption likewise is not realistic but helps to distinguish a good from a bad autocrat, a distinction that is in our view important to make. In the model, everybody, rich and poor, prefers good autocrats to bad autocrats. A good autocrat is drawn randomly with probability and bad autocrat with probability (1 \u2212 ) . We assume that a ruler stays in power forever unless a revolt succeeds in overthrowing him or her. 10 In each period, citizens are able to overcome their collective action problem and to overthrow the ruler with probability q k ( k = I for individualism or k = C for collectivism). We do not need the results below to make any particular assumptions about the ranking of q k between different cultures. A natural assumption might be q C > q I : a collectivist culture can help overcome free-rider problems if a social norm exists of just revolt against an unjust autocratic ruler. Indeed, people in a collectivist culture will conform to the social norm and derive social status or other rewards from doing so (failure to conform may lead to being ostracized). On the other hand, one also can make an argument that q C < q I . In collectivist societies, allegiances are based on tribal or clan affiliation.

In case of successful collective action, it is assumed that an autocrat will be replaced, with probability k , by another autocrat (possibly a good one, which happens with probability ) and that he will be replaced by democracy with probability 1 \u2212 k . We assume that C > I ; that assumption will matter for our results. One justification for the assumption is that collectivist cultures have higher levels of conformism and lower propensities to engage in institutional innovations. Another, probably deeper, justification is that collectivist values place heavier emphasis on the difference between a benevolent ruler and a bad ruler, on political stability and the capacity of a good ruler wisely to arbitrate disputes between different clans and groups. In contrast, individualistic values emphasize individual freedom, equality of citizens before the law, and limited government. 12 Note that in our model, uncertainty exists about what institutional regime will follow the decision to revolt. The only decision taken is to engage in collective action, but the outcome is uncertain. That aspect of the model seems quite realistic.

What happens if we allow culture to be influenced by existing institutions? Suppose that we permit the cultural parameters of our model to change as a function of the length of time spent under a given regime. Indeed, Persson and Tabellini (2009) provide evidence that pro-democracy values are reinforced over time the longer people live under such a regime. Assume, thus, in the framework of our model, that k declines over time after democracy has been introduced. Assume also that k increases over time under a \"good\" autocratic regime and that those changes materialize only under peaceful conditions, i.e., under conditions wherein no revolt takes place. It follows that the results of our model will not change. Indeed, democracy and \"good\" autocracy are both absorbing states, depending on the values of k . Once democracy has been reached, it will not be reversed; variations in k will not modify our conclusions. On the other hand, no revolt will occur under a good autocrat if k is above \u0304k .

The results of the model thus are unchanged if we allow culture to move slowly in such regimes.

The differences are, however, conceptually very substantial. In their model, relevant decisions are taken by the elite. In our model, decisions (to revolt or not) are taken by the mass of people, or their representatives within the elite, and uncertainty over the outcomes of collective action plays a much larger role. The Acemoglu-Robinson model incorporates absolutely no cultural component and the elites decide between either endogenously redistributing income to the poor when they threaten revolt, in order to avert a revolution, or to establish democracy as a credible commitment to redistribution. The probability of success of collective action plays an important role in their model. The more likely successful collective action is, the more likely it is that the elites will prefer to redistribute income to the poor to avoid a revolution. On the other hand, if that probability is lower, they will choose instead to establish democracy to avert a revolt. In contrast, in our model the collective action's probability of success ( q k ) does not play a significant role in determining long-term outcomes. It is instead the cultural parameter, k that determines the long-run probability that a country adopts democracy. Furthermore, to the extent that collective action is easier in collectivist cultures (we provide below some evidence consistent with that claim), our model predicts that a transition from autocracy to democracy is less likely in countries with collectivist cultures, which, as we discuss below is consistent with the data, while models in the Acemoglu-Robinson spirit predict the opposite result.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 164, "text": "Acemoglu and Robinson (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Proof of proposition 2 See the \"Appendix\"."}, {"text": "We now turn to the empirical analysis of the link between culture and democratization.

To avoid cultural biases in the way questions were framed, the survey was translated into local languages by a team of English and local language speakers. With new waves of surveys and replication studies, Hofstede's measure of individualism has been expanded to more than 90 countries. 15 The individualism score measures the extent to which it is believed that individuals are supposed to take care of themselves as opposed to being strongly integrated and loyal to a cohesive group. Individuals in countries with a high level of the individualism index value personal freedom and status, while individuals in countries with a low level of the index value harmony and conformity. Hofstede's index, as well as the measures of individualism from other studies, uses a broad array of survey questions to establish cultural values. Factor analysis is used to summarize data and construct indices. In Hofstede's analysis, the index of individualism is the first factor in work goal questions about the value of personal time, freedom, interesting and fulfilling work, etc. This component loads positively on valuing individual freedom, opportunity, achievement, advancement, recognition and negatively on valuing harmony, cooperation, relations with superiors. Although Hofstede's data were initially collected mostly with the purpose of understanding differences in IBM's corporate culture, the main advantage of Hofstede's measure of individualism is that it has been validated in a large number of studies. The ranking of countries across various studies and measures (see Hofstede (2001) for a review) is very stable. Hofstede's measure has been used extensively in the cross-cultural psychology literature, which views the individualism-collectivism cleavage as the main cultural cleavage across countries (see Heine 2008) .

As we showed above, this does not change the results of the model, but would affect the empirical analysis. Ideally, we would like to have a measure of individualism and collectivism much earlier in time, prior to democratization history. Unfortunately, we do not have such data.

(2008) . 17 These historical data are very important because they give a good idea of the pathogen environment populations were facing in the past, including the very distant past, and in any case before the post-WWII epidemiological revolution when big public health changes started to occur. Panel C of Fig. 2 shows the geographical distribution of historic pathogen prevalence. Given a strong correlation between pathogen prevalence and collectivism, the above studies argue that stronger pathogen prevalence pushed communities to adopt more collectivist values emphasizing tradition, putting stronger limits on individual behavior, and showing less openness towards foreigners. Collectivism is thus understood as a defense mechanism created to cope with greater pathogen prevalence. Obviously, historical pathogen prevalence is only one of the possible reasons for the adoption of collectivism. Nevertheless, as an instrumental variable, it can provide a very useful role in measuring the effect of individualism on democratization. Historical pathogen prevalence can also be argued to satisfy the exclusion restriction since historical pathogen prevalence is not likely to have a direct effect on political regime choice. Indeed, one cannot claim that autocracy is more efficient than democracy, or vice versa, in dealing with pathogen prevalence. Autocracy suffers from lack of transparency, as was seen in China recently with the SARS and COVID-19 epidemic, and is not necessarily more efficient in dealing with a humanitarian disaster, as was the case with the catastrophic handling of the 2008 Fig. 2 Geographical distribution of individualism, polity scores, and pathogen prevalence massive flooding from cyclone Nargis in Myanmar. Likewise, democracy may or may not lack speed in response to a major health epidemic. 18 In some specifications we use another instrumental variable in conjunction with historical pathogen prevalence: the Euclidian distance between the frequency of blood types A and B in a given country and the frequency of those blood types in the USA, which is the most individualistic country in our sample. This is a measure of genetic distance. To the extent that culture is transmitted mainly from parents to children (see for example Fernandez et al. 2004; Fernandez and Fogli 2006 , and the models by Verdier 2000, 2001) , so are genes. Populations that interbreed a lot should be genetically and culturally close because a similar parental transmission mechanism is at work in both cases. Therefore, measures of genetic distance can be seen as a proxy measure of differences in cultural values. Note that these are \"neutral\" genetic markers that have no direct effect on fitness (i.e., ability to think, run, work, etc.) and thus economic, cultural or political outcomes. Because genetic pools evolve slowly, these markers are very unlikely to be affected by economic outcomes, and thus we can exclude reverse causality in our instrumental variable estimates. To be clear, this particular identification strategy does not postulate that the first stage captures a direct causal effect between genes (here blood types) and culture. Instead, this strategy exploits the correlation between cultural and genetic transmission from patents to offspring. We combine this variable with the other instrumental variable mentioned above and apply standard statistical tests for the exclusion restriction. Our measure of genetic distance successfully passes these tests, and one can thus feel more comfortable using it as instrumental variable. 19 The genetic data originate from Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994) , which provides measured genetic markers for roughly 2000 groups of population across the globe. These data contain allele frequencies (alleles are variants taken by a gene) for various ethnic groups. Using the frequency of blood types is attractive because, apart from being neutral genetic markers, the frequency of alleles determining blood types is the most widely available genetic information and thus we can construct the most comprehensive (in terms of country coverage) measure of genetic distance. Since the genetic data are available at the level of ethnic groups while our analysis is done at the country level, we have aggregated genetic information using ethnic shares of population from Fearon (2003) .

The reason is that a collectivist culture will tend to stick to a \"good\" non-predatory autocracy, which will not be the case with an individualistic culture. Predictions of the model have strong, robust support in the data, controlling for existing determinants identified in the literature. To the extent one believes our instrumental variable analysis, these effects may be interpreted as causal.
