This technology has changed many aspects of biological research. Though extremely successful, the chemistry of DNA hybridization precludes its application for studying proteins, which are considered the major driving force in cells. Consistent with this view, mRNA profiles do not always correlate with protein expression as reported in many recent mass spectrometry studies [1] [2] [3] .

This application for protein microarrays stemmed from traditional serology studies, which focus on the diagnostic identification of antibodies in patient serum samples. These antibodies can be produced as part of an immune response to an infection, against a foreign protein, or even against a person's own protein. When proteins on a protein microarray are viewed as potential antigens, researchers can use it as a platform to identify autoantibodies that show statistically significant association with an infection or with a disease of interest. In general, the following approach is used: first, patient sera are diluted (e.g. 1000-fold) and incubated on a preblocked antigen microarray (i.e. protein microarray), followed by a stringent washing step. Then, positive signals are detected using anti-human IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies coupled with various fluorophores for detection ( Fig. 1) . Compared with traditional serology techniques, such as ELISA, agglutination, precipitation, complementfixation, and fluorescent antibodies, protein microarray-based serum profiling is much more sensitive and can be performed at a much higher throughput.

A useful feature of a serum test relative to a nucleic acid diagnostic test is that anti-pathogen antibodies can potentially be detected long after infection. Taking advantage of this, serum samples collected from SARS patients, who recovered from respiratory disease (\u223c320 days after diagnosis), were used to probe the microarray and positive signals were detected with both anti-human IgG and IgM antibodies ( Fig. 2 ; middle panel). These results Figure 1 . Principle of serum profiling assays performed on a functional protein microarray. A functional protein microarray, composed of hundreds of thousands of individually purified proteins, is first blocked with BSA in PBS buffer. Then, a diluted serum sample is incubated on the microarray typically at RT for 1 h.

Detection of immunoglobulin isotypes can be multiplexed with different fluorophores as illustrated. clearly showed that SARS-CoV N proteins could be readily recognized by human IgG antibodies and importantly, not by IgM antibodies, as expected. However, serum samples collected from the Chinese patients immediately after fever was detected showed much stronger signals both in the IgG and IgM profiling ( Fig. 2 ; left panel). These results indicated that the protein microarray approach is capable of detecting anti-pathogen antibodies in serum samples long after infection, as well as detecting infection at early stages of infection as demonstrated by anti-human IgM profiling.

EBV is an ubiquitous human herpesvirus, while KSHV has a restricted seroprevalence. Both viruses are associated with malignancies and show an increased frequency in individuals who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The Zhu and Hayward groups generated a protein microarray consisting of 174 EBV and KSHV full-length proteins that were individually expressed and purified from yeast [36, 41] . Instead of sera, plasma antibody responses to EBV and KSHV were examined from healthy volunteers and patients with B-cell lymphoma or with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma. These experiments detected IgG responses to known antigens, as well as the tegument proteins ORF38 (KSHV), BBRF (EBV), BGLF2 (EBV), and BNRF1 (EBV), and to the EBV early lytic proteins BRRF1 and BORF2. Because IgA responses to EBV EBNA1 and viral capsid antigens have long been used as a diagnostic tool for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, they also found IgA responses in healthy and HIV-infected patients. IgA responses to VCA and to EBNA1 were found to be frequently elevated in lymphoma patients and in individuals who were HIV-1 positive.

CD and UC are chronic, idiopathic, and clinically heterogeneous intestinal disorders collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although IBDs have been suggested to be autoimmune diseases, anti-microbial antibodies are present in the sera of IBD patients, and some of these antigens have proven to be valuable serological biomarkers for diagnosis and/or prognosis of the disease.

Take autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as an example: AIH is a chronic necro-inflammatory disease of human liver with little known etiology. Detection of nonorgan-specific and liver-related autoantibodies using immunoserological approaches has been widely used for diagnosis and prognosis. However, these traditional autoantigens, such as anti-SMA (smooth muscle autoantibodies) and anti-ANA (antinuclear autoantibodies) are often mixtures of complex biological materials. Unambiguous and accurate detection of the disease demands identification and characterization of these autoantigens. Therefore, Song et al. fabricated a human protein microarray of 5011 nonredundant proteins that were expressed and purified as GST fusions in yeast [45] . There are several advantages associated with producing human proteins in yeast rather than bacteria: (i) higher solubility, (ii) higher yields of large proteins (e.g. > 50 kD), (iii) better preserved conformation of proteins, and (iv) proteins are less immunogenic when produced in yeast than in E. coli [17, 21, 25] . However, unlike a viral or bacterial protein microarray, a significant obstacle to the use of a human protein microarray of high content is its high cost. For example, a human protein array of 9000 proteins can exceed $1000 per array. In order to reduce this cost, Song et al. developed a two-phase strategy to identify new biomarkers in AIH. Phase I is designed for rapid selection of candidate biomarkers, which are then validated in Phase II (Fig. 3) . In Phase I, 30 AIH and 30 control serum samples were selected and individually used to probe the Figure 3 . Scheme of the two-phase strategy for biomarker identification in human autoimmune diseases. In Phase I, a small cohort is used to rapidly identify a group of candidate biomarkers via serum profiling assays on a human protein microarray of high cost. Because a small number of microarrays are needed, cost of the experiments is relatively low. In Phase II, a focused protein microarray of low cost is fabricated by spotting down purified candidate proteins. A much larger cohort is then assayed on these arrays in a double blind fashion to validate the candidates identified in Phase I.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 899, "end": 903, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1214, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1218, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1222, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1670, "end": 1678, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1786, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Autoantigen discovery for AIH"}, {"text": "human protein microarrays at a 1000-fold dilution, followed by detection of bound human autoantibodies using a Cy-5-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. Statistical analysis revealed 11 candidate autoantigens. To validate these candidates and to avoid a potential overfitting problem (see below), which is especially likely when dealing with a small sample size, the 11 proteins and three positive controls were re-purified to build a large number of low-cost small arrays for Phase II validation. These arrays were then sequentially probed with serum samples used in Phase I and serum samples obtained from an additional 22 AIH, 50 primary biliary cirrhosis, 43 hepatitis B, 41 hepatitis C, 11 system lupus erythematosus, 11 primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and two rheumatoid arthritis patients. As negative controls, they also included 26 serum samples from patients suffering from other types of severe disease and 50 samples from healthy subjects. Three new antigens, RPS20, Alb2-like, and dUT-Pase, were identified as highly AIH-specific biomarkers with sensitivities of 47.5% (RPS20), 45.5% (Alba-like), and 22.7% (dUTPase), which were further validated with additional AIH samples in a double-blind design. Finally, they demonstrated that these new biomarkers could be readily applied to ELISAbased assays for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. This study represents a new paradigm in biomarker identification using protein microarrays for three reasons. First, a manageable number of candidate biomarkers can be rapidly identified at low cost because fewer expensive protein microarrays of high content are needed in the first phase of this two-phase strategy. Second, by using small arrays comprised selected candidate proteins, the validation step can be rapidly carried out with a much larger cohort at lower cost. This validation step is extremely important for avoiding the overfitting problem associated with statistical analysis in biomarker or classifier identification, especially when dealing with a small cohort (e.g. <40). Overfitting is a problem in which a statistical model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. It generally occurs in biomarker identification when the system is excessively complex, such as having too many individual-to-individual variations relative to the number of samples used. As a result, biomarkers that have been overfit generally have poor predictive performance. Therefore, testing an additional, larger cohort in a double-blind design is an effective way to rule out overfit biomarkers. Third, the author developed ELISAbased assays to examine the performance of the validated biomarkers with additional samples. These newly identified biomarkers serve as a translational step toward clinical practice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Autoantigen discovery for AIH"}, {"text": "In addition, there have been a series of studies that employed pathogen protein microarrays to profile serological responses following infection. For example, protein microarrays have been developed in bacteria and viruses for biomarker identification in various infectious diseases [43, 44, 47, 54] . These studies have clearly demonstrated the power of protein microarrays in identification of potential biomarkers; however, several shortcomings are repeatedly seen in these studies. For instance, many of these arrays were fabricated using proteins translated in E. coli lysates without purification [43, 44, 47, 54] .

On the other hand, many lytic cycle genes involved in replication of the viral genomes (e.g. the orthologous serine/threonine protein kinases) are highly conserved across the herpesvirus family.

Like every largescale screen, the next challenge was to select candidates that would be worth pursuing. To do so, the authors then applied Gene Ontology and STRING analyses (http://string-db.org/, a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions) to these candidates and found a highly connected cluster of 15 proteins. Strikingly, these proteins were all known to be involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) (Fig. 4) . The host DDR has been known to be important to many viruses, including human herpesviruses, and is relevant to virus-induced tumorigenesis [35] . To narrow down this list to a single candidate for in-depth characterization, the authors reasoned that the viruses are likely to target an upstream master regulator, which triggers the DNA damage response. On the basis of a literature search and the structure of this cluster, Tat-interactive protein 60 (TIP60) emerged as an excellent candidate for follow-up, because (i) TIP60 is further upstream in the DDR pathway than any of the other candidates in the cluster; (ii) it serves as a master regulator in DDR via activation of ATM autophosphorylation activity by acetylation; (iii) it regulates chromatin dynamics via histone acetylation; and (iv) its importance has been shown in other viruses. Indeed, the authors observed that when TIP60 was knocked down in EBV-infected B cells, EBV's lytic replication was greatly reduced. Next, the authors applied a series of cell-based assays and showed that during EBV replication, TIP60 activation by the BGLF4 kinase triggers EBVinduced DDR and also mediates induction of viral lytic gene expression.

LANA functions in latently infected cells as an essential participant in KSHV genome replication and as a driver of dysregulated cell growth. Although yeast two-hybrid screens, GST affinity, immunoprecipitation assays, and chromatography coupled with MS have been applied to the identification of LANA binding proteins, each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and each tend to identify different sets of proteins. In this study, the authors used purified FLAG-tagged LANA applied to human protein microarrays to identify 61 potential binding partners, many of which were previously unknown. Eight out of nine proteins were validated by co-immunoprecipitation, including TIP60, protein phosphatase 2A, replication protein A (RPA) and XPA. Although human papillomavirus E6, HIV-1 TAT, and HCMV pUL27 interact with TIP60 and induce TIP60 degradation, LANA-associated 42 retained acetyltransferase activity and showed increased stability. This observation is in line with the study described in the previous section that showed that TIP60 plays a positive role in KSHV lytic replication. On the other hand, identification of RPA as a LANA interacting partner suggested that LANA may play a role in regulating the length of host telomeres, because RPA1 and RPA2 are known to be essential in the replication of cellular telomeric DNA. To test this hypothesis, the authors performed ChIP assays with anti-RPA1 and -RPA2 antibodies using primers specific to the telomere regions and found that the presence of LANA drastically reduced the recruitment of both RPA1 and RPA2 to the host telomeres, while it had no impact on the protein level of the RPA complex. This observation raised the possibility that LANA might have an impact on telomere length. Using Southern blot analysis of terminal restriction fragments, the standard method for quantifying telomere length, the authors demonstrated that the average length of telomeres was shortened by at least 50% in both LANA-expressing endothelial Assisted by GO analysis, 110 shared substrates of conserved herpesvirus kinases were plugged into the STRING database.

The mutation of potential SIMs in BGLF4 at both N-and C-termini changed the intracellular localization of BGLF4 from nuclear to cytoplasmic, while BGLF4 mutated in the N-terminal SIM remained predominantly nuclear. The mutation of the C-terminal SIM yielded an intermediate phenotype with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining. The authors also found that BGLF4 abolished the SUMOylation of the EBV lytic cycle transactivator ZTA, and that this inhibitory effect on ZTA SUMOylation was dependent on both BGLF4 SUMO binding and BGLF4 kinase activity. The global profile of protein SUMOylation was also suppressed by BGLF4 but not by the SIM or kinase-dead BGLF4 mutant.

Rather than developing whole-proteome arrays, they used a bioinformatics approach to predict those proteins present on the cellular surface-and thus most likely to play a role in infection, and used this list of 200 proteins to develop their arrays. They also carefully considered the human probes that they would use, choosing three human ligands: fibronectin, fibrinogen, and C4-binding protein, all known to play important roles in the colonization and infection processes. Binding experiments conducted using the streptococcal arrays and human protein probes identified 17 of the 20 known interactions previously reported as well as eight newly identified streptococcal proteins, many of which they confirmed by far Western blot analysis. These novel proteins included proteins of unknown function as well as three related proteins that they termed the fib proteins. They then used domain mapping to identify regions of the fib proteins required for their interaction with the human ligands. Interestingly, sera samples from patients with S. agalactiae infections show high titers of fib-specific antibodies, indicating that these proteins are highly expressed during infection. Further work will determine the role of these proteins in infection and whether they will emerge as suitable drug targets to fight pathogenic Streptococcus infections.

Although current treatments can yield as high as a 67% disease-free survival rate, the reasons for treatment failure in the remaining one-third of patients are unknown. The identification of biomarkers to allow distinguishing these patients from those that respond to traditional therapies would help identify those patients best suited for alternative therapies, and also potential drug targets. These reverse phase arrays were therefore used as platforms to detect the phosphorylation status of proteins thought to underlie whether rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes were responsive to standard chemotherapy regimens. Using phosphosite-specific antibodies, the authors identified higher phosphorylation levels in four Akt/mTOR pathway components in patients with poor survival outcomes. Network analysis based on this data and known pathway information was used to find that, on the other hand, patients with good treatment outcomes showed mTOR pathway suppression. Together, these findings suggested that pharmacologically inducing mTOR pathway suppression could result in improved outcomes for patients that failed to respond to standard chemotherapy regimens. The authors proceeded to test this hypothesis using a mouse xenograft model with rhabdoymyosarcoma cell lines and a known mTOR pathway inhibitor. They found that treatment with the inhibitor resulted in reduced phosphorylation of the protein 4E-BP1 that had been identified by the protein microarray studies, as well as inhibition of tumor growth. These results suggest that mTOR pathway inhibitors may be a potential way to improve treatment outcomes for patients that fail to respond to standard chemotherapy regimens.

These custom protein arrays, termed \"NAPPA\" arrays (Nucleic Acid Protein Programmable Array), are fabricated by the spotting of cDNAs that encode the target proteins at each feature of the array. Proteins are transcribed and translated by a cellfree system and immobilized by encoded epitope tags, thus bypassing the protein purification process. Additionally, the authors used a three-phase screening approach to home in on the best candidate breast cancer biomarkers. In the first phase, they used arrays with the full set of 4988 tumor antigens in order to eliminate uninformative autoantibodies that were present at similar levels in both early breast cancer patients and healthy women. Subtracting these antigens, the protein set was reduced to 761, allowing them to fabricate smaller arrays for the next phase that offer the benefits of reduced cost and fewer false positives.

The molecular players in these events, in turn, may be the best place to start in efforts to develop novel therapies. In order to identify autoantibody biomarkers that could act as indicators of bladder cancer, as well as the underlying molecular pathology contributing to disease, Orenes-Pinero turned to a protein array strategy using the Invitrogen Protoarray containing approximately 8000 purified human proteins to identify antibodies to tumor-associated antigens in serum [52] . Comparing serum samples collected from 12 patients with bladder cancer and ten control patients without bladder cancer, they identified 171 differentially expressed proteins.

Using immunohistochemistry on a custom tissue microarray comprised bladder cancer tumor samples, they found reduced expression levels of clusterin in muscle invasive bladder tumors as compared to nonmuscle invasive tumors.

This study demonstrated the utility of a lectin microarray in the identification of novel cell surface markers on cancer stem-like cells that subsequently allowed enrichment for cancer stem-like cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 123, "end": 127, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 243, "end": 247, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 248, "end": 252, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 253, "end": 257, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 258, "end": 262, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 263, "end": 267, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 537, "end": 541, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Application of lectin microarrays in cancers"}, {"text": "Because the affinity of lectins is usually low (Kd is in the range of 10 \u22123 -10 \u22126 M) [84] , in processing a cell-binding assay on a lectin microarray, an analyte of low affinity may be washed away from the immobilized lectins, especially when dealing with live cells. In order to overcome these problems, researchers have modified lectin microarray technology in many ways [88] . One example is antibody-assisted lectin profiling that was developed for detecting glycoproteins at low concentrations. Kuno et al. used this method to analyze the glycan structures of a protein hPod, which has been proposed to enhance the metastatic potential of glioblastoma cells [86] . The hPod protein complex was first IP enriched with the appropriate antibody and then incubated on a lectin array to identify its associated glycans. An additional modification of the lectin microarray platform is the use of the evanescentfield activated fluorescence detection system, which allows for label-free, real-time detection. Since the evanescent field is generated within 200 nm, the background signals are so low that washing steps are not necessary. It has been reported that this detection system has by far the highest sensitivity among the lectin microarray detection systems, with a reported detection limit in the 100 pM range [89] . Finally, Li et al. reported a two-phase discovery and validation approach to improve the sensitivity of the lectin microarray technology in cancer biomarker discovery for prostate cancer [90] . First, pooled tissue samples for each group were generated by mixing equal amounts of tissue proteins (50 g) from the four cases in the normal, nonaggressive cancer, aggressive cancer, and metastasis groups. In the first phase, or discovery phase, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME) proteins were extracted from each tissue group using anti-total PSA antibody and anti-MME mAbs, respectively. After incubating the IPed PSA or MME proteins on a lectin microarray, captured PSA or MME proteins were detected with anti-PSA or anti-MME mAbs. Comparison of signals between each group of pooled tissue revealed that the fraction of PSA that is O-glycosylated (as recognized by jacalin) or Neu5Ac conjugated (as detected by SNA), as well as the fraction of MME that was modified by either GalNAc or GlcNac was highly elevated in aggressive prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer groups. These results were confirmed with immunosorbent assay in phase II, in which PSA and MME were first captured on an ECL plate coated with anti-PSA and anti-MME mAbs, followed by detection with biotinylated lectins. These studies demonstrate the power and adaptability of protein microarrays for detection of even low-affinity interactions such as those between lectins and glycans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 86, "end": 90, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 374, "end": 378, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 501, "end": 517, "text": "Kuno et al. used", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 664, "end": 668, "text": "[86]", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1514, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Application of lectin microarrays in cancers"}, {"text": "Recent years have witnessed tremendous growth in the use of protein microarrays to address important questions in the field of clinical proteomics. In the area of biomarker identification, most of the recent research has been focused on either infections or autoimmune diseases. We believe that protein microarrays, especially functional protein microarrays, will be widely used for identification of cancer biomarkers in the near future. Indeed, recent advances in immunoproteomics and high-throughput technologies have suggested that the autoantibody repertoire in cancer patients might be quite different as compared with that in healthy subjects, leading to the hypothesis that autoantigens might be identified as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, as well as cancer prognosis [91] . Ideally, a human protein microarray developed for such a purpose should cover the entire human proteome, in order to enable a comprehensive screen for the autoantigens. To our knowledge, we have fabricated a human proteome microarray of the best coverage (>70%) [21] . However, when hundreds, if not thousands, of serum samples are needed to screen for biomarkers, the cost of using these human proteome microarrays accumulates very rapidly. An effective strategy to overcome this obstacle is to apply the two-phase strategy as described in the AIH study [45] . We expect that this strategy will become popular in the near future. Finally, we expect that functional protein microarrays will be used as a readout to obtain reaction profiles of the collected activities of various types of enzymes, such as kinases, acetyltransferases, ubiquitin, and SUMO E3 ligases in cancerous tissues. Comparing PTM profiles obtained from cancer and healthy tissues will allow us to identify biomarkers and to gain new insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 779, "end": 783, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1052, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1345, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outlook"}, {"text": "This work is supported in part by the NIH (RR020839, DK082840, RO1GM076102, CA125807, CA160036, and HG006434 to HZ; R01EY017589 to JQ, and an AHA Predoctoral Fellowship (10PRE3040000) to EC).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outlook"}, {"text": "The authors have declared no conflicts of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Outlook"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Correlation between protein and mRNA abundance in yeast", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Gygi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Y", "middle": [], "last": "Rochon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Franza", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Aebersold", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "Mol.
