In a large series-1099 patients out of 7736 admissions-reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, 1 symptoms at presentation were predominantly respiratory: cough (67.8%). Median age was 47 years, 60% were male. Fever was present on admission in 43.8% and during the hospital stay in 88.7%. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly less common, including nausea and vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.8%).

This retrospective, consecutive case series from Wuhan, China, highlighted the disease features of 138 patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 2 Interestingly, 14 patients (10.1% of the cohort) presented initially with diarrhoea and nausea, preceding the development of fever and respiratory symptoms by 1-2 days. A single patient was triaged to surgery on admission due to abdominal pain but was later found to have SARS-CoV-2, with no surgical diagnosis. In those with severe disease requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, abdominal pain was more common (8.3% of ICU patients vs 0% non-ICU patients, p=0.02). Hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection was common, occurring in an estimated 41.3% of patients. The data suggest it is important to consider unusual presentations of COVID-19 to all specialties, with widespread testing being the best route to an early diagnosis, promoting patient and staff safety. https:// jamanetwork. com/ journals/ jama/ fullarticle/ 2761044",

Six patients underwent endoscopy with SARS-CoV-2 detected in the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and rectum of the two most severe patients and in the duodenum in one of the other patients.

Preliminary data reported in Gastroenterology from Bergamo, Northern Italy, should provide some grounds for optimism. 5 In their cohort of 522 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (64% ulcerative colitis), including 59 aged less than 18 years, the authors actively monitored patients from 19 February 2020 to 23 March 2020. Patients were advised to continue their treatment unchanged, with 38% of patients on systemic immunosuppressive, or biological, therapy. There were no reported cases of COVID-19, and no patients were admitted during this period. This occurred in a setting where an estimated 46 220 (4% of the population) were infected (based on mathmatical modelling), and the authors hypothesise that, if the infection rate was the same in their IBD population, up to 21 patients would have been infected, without need for hospitalisation, although this is hypothetical. We will need to await further data from the different registries including the international SECURE-IBD database (https:// covidibd. org/) and ESPGHAN PORTO Group (https:// research. szmc. org. il/ redcap/ surveys/? s= FP38CNWRLE).",

In their case report from Lombardy, Italy, Mazza et al 6 report the death of an elderly female patient with ulcerative colitis. This female patient had a 3-year history of leftsided colitis maintained with only 5-ASA therapy and presented acutely with a severe relapse requiring intravenous corticosteroids. Despite initial improvement, the patient deteriorated following development of fever and cough and was diagnosed with likely hospitalacquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accelerated tapering of oral steroids was implemented, but the patient's condition worsened, and she unfortunately died after 14 days of hospitalisation. The major factor for worse outcome in SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be increased age, and the impact of this elderly patient's pre-existing mild ulcerative colitis is unknown. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids leads to considerable immunosuppression, and extra care must be taken in patients on therapy. https:// gut. bmj. com/ content/ early/ 2020/ 04/ 03/ gutjnl-2020-321183",

The presumed mechanism is droplet aerosolisation in most cases, although there are ongoing concerns about faeco-oral transmission. In a preliminary report of nine mild cases by W\u00f6lfel and colleagues, 7 detailed virological analysis is reported and will likely inform further work. There was active viral replication in the upper respiratory tract with high pharyngeal shedding in the first week of symptoms. No live virus was detected in the stool at any stage, in spite of a high viral RNA concentration. However, as only nine cases were studied, this should be interpreted with some caution. Viral RNA was detected in stool 3 weeks later in six of the nine patients despite complete resolution of symptoms, and the patient with the lowest virus neutralisation antibody titre continued to shed viral RNA in the stool for a prolonged period. If confirmed in larger and more symptomatic cases, this may reassure us that the likelihood of faeco-oral transmission is low. https://www. nature. com/ articles/ s41586-020-2196-x_ reference. pdf",

Considering analyses of studies reporting specific groups or outcomes, patients with severe disease were more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms: 17.1% severe patients versus 11.8% non-severe patients. Similarly, paediatric cases appeared more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults, 16.7% adults versus 24.8% children. Stool viral RNA was positive in 48% of patients who were tested on both respiratory and stool specimens, with RNA persisting in the stool beyond the end of respiratory symptoms in 70.3% of patients.

In a small series from clinicians in Wuhan published in EClinicalMedicine, 34 cases are reported (no denominator) who were operated on between 1 January 2020 and 5 February 2020. 9 All were symptom-free at the time of surgery. All developed COVID-19 pneumonia during the recovery period presenting with fever (31 patients), fatigue (25 patients) and dry cough (18 patients). Fifteen required admission to the intensive care unit and seven died. Risk factors included age, comorbidities and lymphopenia.
