A call for new methods of testing and surveillance on a large scale will be important if we hope to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

On example is the Oura ring (Ooura Health Ltd.'s, Oulu, Finland) which can detect physiologic changes and alert the possibility of infection. Understanding changes in vital signs such as body temperature, respiratory and heart rate may enable early detection of signs of infection. For example, one study at West Virginia Univeristy, Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute predicted symptoms 24 hours prior to onset based on physiologic changes detected by the Oura ring, and aim to achieve a 3-day forecast in the future. 4 Implementation of preventative measures before symptoms are apparent when there may be a risk of viral shedding may translate into a much larger benefit than we anticipate and has the potential to reduce infection in other healthcare workers and patients.",

For many countries, their success can be partially attributed to early implementation of intervention and prevention measures. For example, Australia developed a GPS-enabled smartphone app to identify hot spots of infection and acts as a method of contact tracing. 6 Continuous communication of the infection status in their area can enable the public to Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f make informed decisions that minimize their risk of infection and/or prompt follow-up testing in these individuals. With the recent reports of a second surge of cases in multiple states despite current intervention and prevention measures, it is important to consider innovative techniques that offer promising results. Use of technology-based methods of contact tracing is a realistic solution that have already demonstrated success in other countries and can be applied to the U.S. as we consider alternative methods of contactless surveillance and contact tracing.",
