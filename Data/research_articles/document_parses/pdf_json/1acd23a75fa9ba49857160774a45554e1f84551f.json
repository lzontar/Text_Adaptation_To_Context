The models associated with this field of study usually have exponential prior assumptions in the number of new cases, while the exploration of spatial data has been little analyzed in these models. In this paper, we model the number of new cases of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a problem of reconstruction of time-varying graph signals. To this end, we proposed a new method based on the minimization of the Sobolev norm in graph signal processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in two COVID-19 databases provided by Johns Hopkins University. In the same way, we prove the benefits of the convergence rate of the Sobolev reconstruction method by relying on the condition number of the Hessian associated with the underlying optimization problem of our method.",

Several developed countries such as the United States of America (USA), Italy, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, among others, have had problems trying to contain the outbreak. The capacity of some countries to detect new cases has been overwhelmed by the exponential number of cases, leading to a poor and unreliable estimation of the number of new cases. As a matter of fact, Colombia slowed down the testing of suspected new cases of COVID-19 between March 25th and 27th in 2020 because of a failure in an essential machine for the COVID-19 diagnosis.",

Our algorithm associates a graph to the geographical localization of cities or countries, and the number of new COVID-19 cases is represented by a graph signal that evolves in time [8] [9] [10] . Intuitively, the prior assumption of this work is that the number of new COVID-19 cases is smooth both in the graph and in time, i.e., the number of new COVID-19 cases should be similar in nearby localities, and the change in time is progressive. Unlike previous mathematical models of infectious diseases, this paper takes into account the underlying spatial information of the problem. In the same way, we propose a new time-varying graph signals reconstruction algorithm based on the minimization of the Sobolev norm of Graph Signal Processing (GSP) [11] . Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time-varying graph signals, while showing convergence rate benefits based on the Hessian of the underlying problem.

Average mean square error using the reconstruction method proposed by Qiu et al. in [10] , natural neighbor interpolation [22] , and our method with Sobolev norm, versus the sampling density considering the reconstruction in 4 databases with 100 different sampling matrices J. very far from Qiu and Sobolev methods. Our method also outperforms NNI in the sea surface temperature and PM 2.5 concentration, while having relatively the same performance with respect to Qiu's algorithm. Moreover, Figure 4 shows the average number of iterations with both Qiu's method and our proposed Sobolev algorithm, in this case the Sobolev reconstruction clearly performs better than Qiu's method for the COVID-19 databases, and slightly better in the PM 2.5 concentration dataset.
