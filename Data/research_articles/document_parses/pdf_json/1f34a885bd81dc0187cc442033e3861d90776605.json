Infants of mothers with asthma are more likely to wheeze and have a higher risk of developing asthma than infants of non-asthmatic mothers. Methods: A prospective cohort study of viral infection in pregnancy was conducted between 2007 and 2009, and a subgroup of infants of mothers with asthma was followed up at 6 and 12 months of age. During common colds, nasal and throat swabs were collected from mothers and respiratory viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction. Respiratory health of infants was assessed by parent-completed questionnaire. Results: Twelve-month-old infants whose mothers had confirmed viral infections in pregnancy (n = 26) reported more frequent wheeze (40% had 4-12 wheeze attacks compared with 0%), sleep disturbed by wheeze (1 night per week or more in 60% vs. 11%), beta agonist treatment for wheeze (27% vs. 0%), prolonged colds (2 wk or longer 31% vs. 0%), more eczema (40% vs. 6.3%), and parent-perceived asthma (32% vs. 0%), compared with infants whose mothers had common colds without laboratory-confirmed viral infection (n = 16). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a relationship between maternal respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and wheezing illness in infants of mothers with asthma.

Asthma develops in one of every six children in Australia and is the most common chronic disease leading to disability in childhood (17) .

Epidemiological studies aimed at further elucidating the relationship between genetic and environmental factors associated with maternal asthma and the subsequent development of allergic asthma in early life have mostly produced indirect evidence for a complex gene-environmental interaction facilitating a predominant role of maternal asthma during pregnancy for the development of subsequent asthma in the offspring (19) . For example, maternal imprinting of 'asthma genes' after conception (20) , intra-uterine infections leading to distorted immune responses at the feto-maternal interface (21) , previous pregnancies and exposure to children during pregnancy (22) , placental dysfunction leading to low birth weight, premature labor, and subsequent prematurity (23) , and intra-uterine smoke exposure (24, 25) have all been linked to an altered risk for the development of asthma in early life. Some of those risk factors (e.g., low birth weight) have also been associated with maternal asthma exacerbations during pregnancy in independent cohorts (26) .
