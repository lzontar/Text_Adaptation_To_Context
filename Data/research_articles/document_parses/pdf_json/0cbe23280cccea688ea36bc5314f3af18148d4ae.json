Scenario 4 was based on 'flexible social distancing', where day 15 to 30 are identical to scenario 2, but where in addition the number of daily exposures gradually decreases from 10 to 5 over the course of subsequent 15 days. Scenario 5 is referred to as 'exit strategy' scenario where after 30 days of lock-down (as in scenario 3), the exposure rate gradually increases until it reaches 70% of the original rate, reflecting 15% vulnerable individuals remaining in a lock-down along with their caregivers. During the exit period, the hospitalization rate starts at 70% of the original value at the start of the simulation and gradually increases to 85%. Analysis Using the base values, we estimated the number of individuals for each of the seven compartments on a weekly basis. Each model run began on April 5 th , 2020 and simulated the spread of the disease in the population for one calendar year. For each province, 1000 simulation iterations were run to improve the reliability of the predictions, given the stochastic nature of the model. We recorded the number of individuals in each compartment each day as well as the number of hospitalizations -of which 15% were assumed to require critical care -and case fatalities.

Under this scenario, total expected number of cumulative case fatalities is 671,596. While the self-isolation strategy (Scenario 2) yielded approximately half as many case fatalities as the no intervention strategy, this showed the second highest number of cumulative case fatalities at 341,359. The strict social distancing strategy (Scenario 3) showed the fewest total number of cumulative case fatalities estimated at 1,588. With flexible social distancing (Scenario 4), the estimated total number of cumulative case fatalities is higher estimated at 3,995. Under the exit strategy (Scenario 5), the total number of cumulative case fatalities is estimated at 28,214 by March 2021. The temporal trends of national-level estimates of ICU-hospitalization requirements over are shown in the Appendix (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). Without any public health intervention, the COVID-19 virus is expected to peak in terms of the number of required ICU-hospitalizations at 198,593 persons by the end of the June 2020 (Table 2). With self-isolation, the COVID-19 virus, on the other hand, is expected to peak in June 2020 with 66,306 patients requiring ICU hospitalization for COVID-19. With the strict social distancing strategy, the COVID-19 virus is expected to peak in terms of the number of required ICU-hospitalizations at 266 persons by the end of May 2020. With flexible social distancing, the highest number of required ICU 903 is expected around May 2020. Under the exit strategy scenario, the COVID-19 virus is expected to peak in terms of the number of required ICUhospitalizations at 4,830 persons by the end of December 2020, that could be potentially manageable by the local health system at capacity.

Generally, the simulated effects of the different public health intervention strategies at the provincial-level were similar to the national-level with no intervention strategy showing the highest number of case fatalities and ICUhospitalizations at each of the provinces and strict social distancing strategy showing the fewest number of case fatalities and ICU-hospitalizations. Without any public health intervention, Punjab where 53% of the Pakistani population reside according to the 2017 census, the highest number of case fatalities (n = 370,050) and required ICUhospitalizations (n = 148,327 in June 2020) were observed from our simulations. The province of Balochistan that has the lowest urban-to-rural ratios, on the other hand, showed the fewest number of case fatalities (n=36,188) and required-ICU hospitalizations (n = 10,285 in June 2020) without any public health intervention strategy.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Figure 4 illustrate the national-level estimates of cumulative case fatalities during the same period with sensitivity bands of different case fatality rates and different infectivity of asymptomatic patients, respectively.

Again, consistent with the case analyses, the scenario of no public health intervention resulted in the worst outcomes with respect to the number of case fatalities and number of persons requiring hospitalization.

Consideration of a temporary strict social distancing strategy with gradual return of the lower-risk Pakistani population, as simulated in our exit strategy scenario, may an effective compromise between public health and economy of Pakistani population.Our model and analyses are not without limitations. COVID-19 is a new disease caused by a novel virus, and thus there are inevitable uncertainties in the data inputs that were utilized for this modelling study. In this regard, our prediction of the epidemic duration and size should be interpreted as applicable to the confirmed cases based on the testing method implemented in Pakistan. While we took into account the impact estimates of social distancing on regular activities from Google, the model also assumes homogenous mixing (contacts) between members of the population, without taking age group, fine-scale geography or other social factors into account. Additional work is required to add these aspects to such models. These figures largely represent people with smart phones and exclude the rural poor and slum dwellers. The network structure of each individual's social circles also was not taken into consideration for this study, and there is also little information available on periodic clustering of people in mosques etc.Regardless of these limitations, to our knowledge, this extended stochastic ICM model is the first to examine the effects of self-isolation and social distancing on the number of ICU hospitalizations required and case fatalities in South Asia.
