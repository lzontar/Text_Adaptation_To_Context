In March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 dramatically increased the number of countries recording deaths 3 , providing an opportunity to use mortality rate, which is measured more homogeneously across countries than infection rates, as a descriptor of the COVID-19 outbreak over a large latitudinal range. Here, using data recorded in 208 territories from 88 countries, we show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature and positively affected by higher relative humidity.

This is of utmost importance, as the possible climatic dependency of COVID-19 could help decision-makers to adopt the most suitable strategy to control the disease in the near future. There are several recent studies that have tackled this question since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, available on online archive repositories. As for other viruses, temperature and humidity seem to be factors with some influence on the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but recent studies led to contrasting results. In general, a negative relationship is found between air temperature and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus 13, 14 , but a positive one 15 and a lack of effect 16 have also been reported.

This correlation might be influenced by the higher impact of this disease in the northern hemisphere during the first months of 2020. However, the reasons for this correlation remain unclear, and may lead to temperature-biased numbers of COVID-19 positive patients across countries. Therefore, we argue that descriptors based on the number of tests performed should not be used to assess the contribution of air temperature (or other climatic factors) in the trans-country COVID-19 outbreak. To reach a better comprehension of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global extent of the disease in March 2020 brings new data to test the effects of climatic factors. Indeed, the number of countries recording deaths increased from nine by the end of February 2020 to more than 120 by the end of March 2020 3 , providing a first-hand opportunity to use the mortality rate as the descriptor of COVID-19 outbreak over a large latitudinal range. Here we use the mortality rate expressed as the number of deaths per inhabitant over a standardized time period of 15 days, corresponding to the 15 days following the first reported COVID-19 death in the country. This metric is much less dependent on the local testing strategy. In almost all countries, the number of COVID-19 deaths publicly reported corresponds to the cases of COVID-19 positive patients and patients displaying clear diagnostic COVID-19", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "established, and thus we included other known explanatory factors in our analyses: the proportion of the most susceptible age group in the population, the number of beds in hospitals (reflecting access to health care), and the timing and strength of governmental travel measures for controlling the spread of the disease.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "that warm air temperatures, intense UV light, or low relative humidity may act by reducing the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or it may directly or indirectly inactivate this virus. Preliminary results indicate that, under laboratory conditions, the SARS-Cov-2 virus survives less than 4 days at 37\u00b0 C 24 while at 4 \u00b0C it may remain stable for more than 14 days 25 , offering one possible explanation to the negative relation between air temperature and the COVID-19 mortality rate. Some evidence suggests that the transmission efficiency of influenza viruses by respiratory droplet increases when air is cold and dry 26 . Moreover, in periods of the year or places of the world with cold and dry air and reduced UV light, other human respiratory diseases are more frequent 27 and may facilitate inter-individual transmission via coughing or sneezing. When the weather is cold, people also tend to spend more time in closed and populated environments, which also facilitates inter-individual transmission. A causative link between exposure to sunlight (including UV light), a higher synthesis of vitamin D, and better efficiency of the human immune system has been evidenced 28 , which may explain in part the negative relation between the UV-index and the COVID-19 mortality rate . Yet, these modes of action remain hypotheses to be tested in the case of COVID-19.Humankind is facing an unprecedented worldwide crisis, forcing decision makers to move forward into the labyrinth of unknowns. Understanding how climatic factors have contributed to the COVID-19 outbreak until now could strengthen the projections of its future spread. Previous analyses were unable to provide an unambiguous view because of limited data or biased descriptors for country-wise comparisons. Using global datasets and a homogeneous descriptor of the COVID-19 outbreak, we show that air temperature and UVindex are related climatic variables that play a substantial role in explaining the COVID-19 mortality rate.

We used the latest available data per country, which varied from 2005 to 2015, but most data were from the period 2010-2015. Governmental immigration restrictions per country were used as a proxy for the governmental travel measures for controlling the spread of the disease. This last dataset was taken from the COVID-19 Travel Restriction Monitoring database, compiled by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) 33 . We added some missing data directly from the primary source database, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) 34 . For each country and date, from March 8 to March 26, we summed the number of other countries for which immigration restrictions were imposed. We considered all the IOM traveling restriction categories with a link to COVID-19 spread control. Based on these daily immigration restrictions, we grouped the countries into three categories.

This variable was log-transformed in order to maintain a linear relationship with the predictor variables.
