In cases of kidney transplantation, if the risk to the recipient exceeded the benefit of the transplant, the procedure was postponed. Conversely, when the transplantation was urgent (eg. heart, lung, liver, combined and paediatric transplantation) it was recommended to perform the transplant.",

Two of these took place at our Unit compared to 5 during the same period in 2019. [5] Our hospital is the tertiary referral centre for all severe cases of COVID-19 from the Paris metropolitan area with a dedicated facility for COVID-19-positive patients, and our LT Unit maintained a continued level of service for LT patients. Since March 30 th , we expanded our ICU capacity from 90 to 157 beds. Of these, 116 were dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients only. This means that a significantly smaller quantity of beds was available to COVID-19-negative patients. Access to ICU care forms a critical component of LT and thus, key decisions were needed to balance the risks of patient safety and organ allocation.",
