Amid this natural experiment, current study evaluates prevailing municipal solid waste (MSW) management practices, with the emphasis on MSW treatment and disposal facilities in select developed and developing countries. The data and information used in this paper is collected from several scientific research papers from different disciplines, publications from governments and multilateral agencies and media reports. Despite limited literature on MSW management during such pandemics, this article presets a global backdrop of MSW management during COVID-19 outbreak and examines various aspects of MSW management. Discussion includes identifying parameters of disease transmission through solid waste handling, consequences of medical waste surge on current municipal waste treatment and disposal systems. Further, based on previous pandemic and disaster waste management studies, this study also presents challenges and opportunities in the aftermath of the ongoing pandemic. The paper recommends alternatives approaches for MSW treatment and disposal and outlines the future scope of work to achieve sustainable waste management during and aftermath of the pandemics.",

These guidelines address food waste management at households, institutions and business levels (US EPA, 2020). In India, countrywide lockdown coincided with the country's peak harvesting time of a variety of seasonal crops. Summer vegetables and fruits were ripe and ready to pick; wheat, paddy and barley crops were also ready for harvest. However, due to the sudden lockdown in the country, most of the produce was wasted (FAO, 2020). In addition to announcing economic stimulus plan, the government of India also undertook measures to counter wastage of perishable products. Food inspectors were involved to ensure disbursement of food items to restaurants, grocery establishments, and the affected people. Importantly, technological interventions such as food delivery applications enabled the government to reach the localized and remote individuals ensuring efficient food management and reduce the food wastage (FAO, 2020).",

Waste treatment and recycling service is affected due to the waste stream prioritization for MSW management during COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 16 management is integrating decentralized approach with the existing MSW management system. Decentralized waste management involves treatment and recycling of the waste in the vicinity of waste generation source. This reduces the burden on waste collection and transportation services, which can significantly reduce the risk of infection to personnel involved. Moreover, decentralized approach can be implemented for select types of wastes at reduced investment and operating cost. Finally, the approach is easily adaptable to the existing waste management practices (Bhave and Kulkarni, 2019). Integration of different approaches for solid waste management optimizes the existing systems and implements new waste management systems. In addition to climate concern, the recycling and energy recovery enriches the resource efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts from greenhouse gas emission (Ramachandra et al., 2018) .",

For waste management during the natural or manmade disasters, the United States Federal emergency management agency (FEMA) recommends developing temporary waste storage and reduction sites between waste generation sites and final disposal sites. Temporary waste storage sites play multiple roles. Firstly, they can provide a buffer and space by hauling waste from the source of waste generation to the TWSRS. Secondly, operations such as sorting, shredding, and chipping can be done at the TWSRS to reduce the amount of waste as well as preparing for recycling. Finally, they can act as temporary storage J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 17 places before the final disposal of waste (Cheng and Thompson, 2016) . Selection of temporary storage sites and processing sites is crucial during emergency situations. This facilitates in allocating human resources and vehicles, storage of the waste as well as processing of them (Zhang et al., 2019) . TWSRS selection criteria suggested in the literature include, length of storage time, real estate costs, site size and capacity, condition of waste materials, sites for designated materials, ease of accessibility, traffic condition, length of haul, truck size and equipment required (Cheng and Thompson, 2016) . Moreover, it is important to know the origin and characteristics of the waste that are transported to temporary storage sites, in order to prevent problems like odour, noise and potential contamination (Gabrielli et al., 2018) . For example, in the UK, to manage the additional waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic, temporary waste storage capacity has been increased (DEFRA government of UK, 2020a). Temporary waste storage and reduction sites equipped with waste pre-treatment facilities like grinding and screening on such locations will reduce the waste volume for the final treatment and disposal (Berger et al., 2011) . Studies have assessed the viability of temporary waste storage, recycling and other aspects of waste management during disasters like earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes.",

The work highlighted potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in these practices and reported riskmitigating approaches to MSW management such as decentralized waste management and its integration with existing system. The study also contributed to the existing literature by evaluating the governments' responses in some of the developed and developing countries to the increased burden on MSW management systems due to pandemic. Present study can be considered as a report on MSW management in the COVID-19 natural experiment.",

Further investigation is required to evaluate variations in waste characteristics and quantity of waste generation. These are the prerequisite conditions to develop effective waste treatment and disposal facilities. There is also an immediate need to evaluate economic, environmental and social feasibility of integrating alternative approaches like decentralized systems with existing MSW management during public health emergencies. Role of temporary storage and reduction facilities in handling the excess waste, its economic repercussions, and availability of staff for the task during such outbreaks need to be assessed. To ensure uninterrupted MSW management services and safeguard personnel involved during lockdowns, role of automation in waste management needs to be explored. As the world adapts ",

Solid waste management related studies are scattered across different disciplines (e.g. environmental science, disaster operations management and management science) (Zhang et al., 2019).

However, little attention has been paid to the management of MSW. Municipal waste management is an essential and routine service which is indispensable.

Virus was removed and assayed for infectivity at various time points (Warnes et al., 2015). Doremalen et al.

For surfaces, viruses were applied on the cardboard, steel, plasticand other test surfaces maintained at 21 to 23\u00baC and 40% relative humidity, the observation period was 7 days. For studying survival time in aerosols, viruses were aerosolized in a rotating drum maintained at 21 to 23 \u00baC, 65% relative humidity and was observed over three hours(Doremalen et al., 2020).Kampf et al. (2020) reviewed the survival time of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces; the study observed that human coronaviruses can remain infectious on like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days(Kampf et al., 2020).

Kumar and Samadder (2017) have estimated that the inorganic fraction of MSW which mainly consists of plastic, rubber, metal and glass is approximately 54.00% for developed nations, whereas for developing countries it is 32.00%. This indicates that waste materials generated from households and quarantine facilities with the infected or suspected patients may contain possible SARS-Cov-2 and could be a source of infection for people outside the facility (Nghiem et al., 2020).",

During COVID-19 outbreak, presence of any potential source of infection on wastes collected from healthcare facilities and residential premises with COVID-19 positive cases will risk the health of personnel involved in waste management. COVID-19 spreads by droplets shed of the respiratory system by someone with the virus, which implies that it would waste from hospitals is a demanding task as residual pathogens have to be destroyed prior to disposal(Klemes et al., 2020). These wastes are classified before their further processing; the typical composition of healthcare waste is approximately 85.00% general noninfectious, 10.00% infectious/hazardous and 5.00% chemical/radioactive.Treatment facilities are typically equipped to handle steady-state conditions where the medical waste is handled at a predictable average flowrate and composition. The choice of treatment is a function of economic, technical, environmental, and social acceptability. Rapid increase in waste volume is likely to upset systems that are designed for steady-state conditions (Klemes et al., 2020). Disposal of non-hazardous waste from healthcare facilities follows the typical solid waste management protocol (WHO, 2017). This has been the practice in several countries, for instance, India, in its guidelines to manage health care waste during COVID-19 pandemic, has recommended the disposal of general solid waste generated from medical facilities including households with positive COVID-19 cases as per the prevailing local method of disposing general solid waste (CPCB the government of India, 2020).

Observing how the additional waste overwhelmed China's medical transport and disposal infrastructure, the Asian development bank has emphasized the need for additional waste management infrastructure to reduce the further spread of COVID-19 and the emergence of other diseases.Adding non-infectious medical waste to typical MSW generated increases the burden on existingMSW management system. The amount of waste overloads the existing treatment and disposal facilities, posing the risk of secondary contagion from inadequate waste management (Klemes et al., 2020). To handle the surge in waste amount, Spain has recommended that if necessary, cement plants can co-incinerate waste upon request. In Norway, the government has allowed temporary change in landfill permits (and permits to carry waste elsewhere) to cope with the medical waste surge (ACRPlus, 2020). Following the measures during circuit breaker period till 1 June 2020, Singapore's public waste collection services (PWCs) are facing manpower constraints, which have affected some of their collection schedules. The PWCs have made interim operational adjustments in some areas and selectively implemented alternate day collection of refuse at some landed premises and housing development board premises (National environment agency Singapore, 2020). Countries have mitigated COVID-19 transmission through social distancing, self-quarantining, avoiding large gatherings, working from home, sending back students to their residences, providing online education, reduced travel, limiting visits to stores and many such activities have become routine during this pandemic (Sarkis et al., 2020). These measures have led consumers to increase their demand for online shopping for home delivery. Consequently, amount of biodegradable household waste has increased (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). This presents significant challenges for the provision of waste collection, treatment and disposal of wastes (Nghiem et al., 2020).",

Recycling of domestic recyclable waste in most developed countries is part of the MSW management that is directly managed by government departments. The recycling is always operated by standardized, specialized enterprises; thus, in most developed countries recycling systems could be considered as formal systems. Nevertheless, for many developing countries that have relatively low economic and regulation level the treatment of MSW is not well developed (Fei et al., 2016). In an effort to continue MSW management services during COVID-19 outbreak developed countries have prioritized waste categories for collection and further processing. For example, the UK has defined high, medium, and low priority waste streams, and recyclable waste has been categorized as the medium and low priority categories which are collected once in a week/fortnight (DEFRA government of UK, 2020a). A few cities in the USA have stopped recycling programs as authorities are concerned about the risk of COVID-19 spreading in recycling centers (Zambrano-Monserrate et al., 2020). Singapore has reduced the frequency of recyclable waste collection from the housing premises during circuit breaker period (National environmental agency, Singapore, 2020). The accumulated recyclable waste from households may act as potential source of infection if there are any suspected cases of COVID-19 in the proximity. Such waste poses threat to waste management personnel as well. Most of the European countries have prohibited waste segregation in corona virus infected households (ACRPlus, 2020). in developing countries is driven by both formal and informal sectors, during the current coronavirus pandemic, while personnel involved in waste handling across the countries are protecting their communities, those in the informal sector face risk to their own health and livelihoods as countries lockdown and economies slow down (World Bank, 2020).",

A possible solution for processing large quantum of waste is thermal treatment (waste to energy) with energy recovery facility. Studies have reported that volume reduction of 80.00 to 95.00% is achievable for generated waste by thermalconversion technologies (Singh et al., 2011; Kumar and Samadder, 2017; World Bank, 2018). of modern day thermal treatment system include hygienisation (waste is decomposed at temperature > 850\u00baC), mineralization and immobilization of hazardous substances and resource conservations (Brunner and Rechberger, 2015). Mayer et al. (2019) assessed the waste to energy technologies implemented in developed and developing nations, they observe that developed countries have turned away from landfills, either due to environmental concerns or scarcity in the land area, and subsequently developed waste to energy technologies for waste management. However, in developing countries, depending on waste type, both recycling and recovery may demand an advanced plant design, medium to high engineering complexity and major capital costs (Mayer et al., 2019). Due to these reasons both options are often disregarded and major fraction of the waste generated is disposed in landfills and open dump sites. The study claims that the technologies like waste to energy are rarely utilized in developing countries (Mayer et al., 2019).",
