For comparison, the CC 50 value of (+/-) CR-31-B was determined using primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). Data is representative of four experimental replicates. Average CC 50 across the two biological replicates is plotted. Methods: A549 cells were infected with the ZIKV strain 976 Uganda (U) (kindly provided by the European Virus Archive) using an MOI of 0.1 for 16 h. Simultaneously, the cells were treated with compounds in the respective concentrations. Afterwards, the inoculum was removed and cells were washed with PBS and treated with compounds for additional 8 h. Cells were lysed in peqGold Trifast 24 hpi to isolate intracellular RNA. After reverse transcription the ZIKV genomes were quantified by qRT-PCR to determine the EC50 as described above. Cell viability of A549 cells was determined using the PrestoBlue Cell viability reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after treatment with the substances in the respective concentrations for 72 h. ",
