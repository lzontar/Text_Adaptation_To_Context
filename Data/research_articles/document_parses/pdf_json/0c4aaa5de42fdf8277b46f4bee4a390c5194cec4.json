Cardiovascular imaging, and echocardiography in particular, is increasing in demand and complexity. It is imperative to find ways to decrease variability among echocardiographers, improve efficiency, and decrease acquisition time. This is where AI could be extremely advantageous for the benefit of patients, sonographers, and cardiologists. The latest American Society of Echocardiography guideline on performing a comprehensive transthoracic examination recommends obtaining >100 images. 2 It would be beneficial to have AI assist with adhering to these American Society of Echocardiography guidelines for standardizing views and measurements in echocardiography.",

Machine learning involves programming a computer to store, learn, and analyze data. As a subset of AI, machine learning uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve with experience. Machine learning allows a computer to take data that are input, learn from these data, predict an outcome, and improve its own knowledge on how to react the next time it is presented with similar data. Machine learning has many applications today, including speech and natural language processing, image and video processing and recognition, autonomous vehicles, and game-playing computers. 5, 6 An easy-to-understand example in echocardiography is a machine's ability to identify structures within an image and accurately label them, such as identifying an image as a parasternal long-axis view rather than an apical long-axis view. 7 Machine learning can be developed by either supervised learning or unsupervised learning. The simplistic difference between the two is that unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data, whereas supervised learning uses labeled or known data. In unsupervised learning, the machine takes unlabeled data sets and detects previously unknown patterns. The term ''supervised learning'' is the process of giving algorithms known or labeled inputs along with desired outputs and is the most common type of machine learning used today. This method enables a machine to classify or predict objects, problems, or situations on the basis of labeled data fed into the machine. The goal of supervised learning is to have a machine receive new (untaught) input variables and correctly predict output variables. 5 An example is a program that can analyze two apical echocardiographic views and produce an accurate value of ejection fraction (EF) without drawing borders and assessing ventricular volumes. Because the program was ''trained'' on thousands of images with known EFs, it is able to produce an EF value that is as accurate as that of an expert cardiologist with >20 years of experience. 8 ",

These deep learning networks are based on multilayered configurations called an artificial neural network to process data ( Figure 2 ). These artificial neural networks, often hundreds of layers deep, can train themselves from large data sets and make accurate predictions on newly input unknown data. They also have the ability to learn from their experiences but require that the initial ''training'' data set be accurate and without bias. Training without bias is critically important and means that the initial data are free of any outside influences that might cloud the information, such as demographic information or additional medical information that may suggest a certain diagnosis. Without bias also means that the ''training'' data set is large enough to contain a wide variety of patients. For echocardiography, such a data set would include studies from both sexes along with a range of body mass index, ages, and image quality. This is imperative for the machine to learn patterns on the basis of the images alone. The components of an artificial neural network are loosely related to the components of a biological neuron consisting of multiple layers in which the data are processed consecutively until the final output is achieved. 6, 8 We can train a deep learning algorithm on a set of labeled echocardiographic views from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and use that algorithm to predict hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from new images. 1 This is an example of AI, because the system recognizes a pattern an experienced sonographer might recognize: seeing a parasternal long-axis view of the heart and being suspicious that the patient might have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

When an image passes through a layer of a CNN, it is divided into hundreds of small regions, and each region is analyzed by that layer of the CNN. Filters can detect characteristics of the image, like an edge or a corner. The image is scanned by each of the layers and passed on to the next layer. 4 Initial layers can detect simple geometric boundaries or edges; deeper layers will detect a more complex pattern, such as ventricular chambers.
