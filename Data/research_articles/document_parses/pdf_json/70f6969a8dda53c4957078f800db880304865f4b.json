Three sources were used to select conditions; first: the Quality and Outcomes Framework reports the most common diseases in the UK; [2] second: a large UK based study containing 40 recommended disorders; [3] third: a systematic review on multimorbidity indices including 17 conditions. [4] Based on these we selected 36 chronic conditions (supplementary). The ten most prevalent co-occurring chronic conditions from these 36 (threshold \u22655 participants) are presented.
