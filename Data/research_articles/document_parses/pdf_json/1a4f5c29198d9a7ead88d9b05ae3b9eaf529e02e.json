Because children appear to be less severely affected than adults, their imaging appearances have not been extensively reported. Objective To systematically review available literature regarding imaging findings in paediatric cases of COVID-19. Materials and methods We searched four databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar) for articles describing imaging findings in children with COVID-19. We included all modalities, age <18 years, and foreign language articles, using descriptive statistics to identify patterns and locations of imaging findings, and their association with outcomes. Results Twenty-two articles were included, reporting chest imaging findings in 431 children, of whom 421 (97.7%) underwent CT. Criteria for imaging were lacking. At diagnosis, 143/421 (34.0%) had a normal CT. Abnormalities were more common in the lower lobes and were predominantly unilateral. The most common imaging pattern was ground-glass opacification (159/255, 62.4%). None of the studies described lymphadenopathy, while pleural effusions were rare (three cases). Improvement at followup CT imaging (3-15 days later) was seen in 29/100 (29%), remained normal in 25/100 (25%) and progressed in 9/100 (9%). Conclusion CT chest findings in children with COVID-19 are frequently normal or mild. Lower lobes are predominantly affected by patchy ground-glass opacification. Appearances at follow-up remain normal or improve in the majority of children. Chest CT imaging adds little to the further management of the patient and should be reserved for severe cases or for identifying alternative diagnoses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "A novel strain of coronavirus (referred to as 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2), which causes the sometimes severe respiratory infection COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan city, China, toward the end of 2019 [1] .

Therefore, follow-up CT imaging would also be better guided by clinical symptoms rather than being performed as a matter of routine. These recommendations have recently been incorporated into newly published guidelines for imaging in [44] , which encourages a pragmatic approach based on patient symptom severity using chest radiography for initial workup and only for follow-up in moderate to severe cases, reserving an initial chest CT only where a clinical change in management is anticipated and for the post-recovery stages. Useful advice regarding general staff protection and departmental organisation for imaging of COVID-19 cases has also been recently provided by the European Societies of Radiology (ESR) and Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) [45] . It is worth noting that although our inclusion criteria were not set to review infected pregnant women, there was one case in this review of an infected newborn, diagnosed at 36 h of age from a COVID-19-positive mother [27] . The authors proposed the possibility for vertical transmission as a route of infection; however, several subsequent articles reviewing outcomes of infected pregnant women have now suggested this to be unlikely [39, [46] [47] [48] . A recently published rapid review of coronavirus in pregnancy [49] found that of the 32 infected women identified in the literature, there was 1 stillbirth (34 weeks of gestation) and 15/32 (47%) pre-term deliveries. In the 15/32 (47%) neonates who were tested for COVID-19, all were negative. The latest guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [50] has therefore recommended against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies and has not found any evidence to suggest intrauterine fetal infection or teratogenic effects from the novel coronavirus. Clinicians should thus remain alert to alternative, more common diagnoses in newborns presenting with respiratory symptoms (e.g., respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration, pneumonia from alternative organisms), even if the mother is COVID-19 positive [48] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 770, "end": 774, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1284, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1510, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1727, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1732, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1737, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1742, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1811, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2118, "end": 2122, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2587, "end": 2591, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although we performed a comprehensive systematic review, there are still several gaps in our radiologic knowledge regarding COVID-19 in children.

In adults, POCUS has been reportedly used to triage more severe cases for urgent management by helping to identify areas of groundglass opacification (so-called B lines) as well as areas of necrotic lunga marker of the more advanced stages of infection [54] . Nevertheless, given that severe disease in children is less likely, the extent to which POCUS might be helpful is questionable, although it has been recommended as one of several potential options for lung assessment by a Chinese expert consensus review for neonatal management in COVID-19 [55] . Two adult publications have reported the use of [F-18]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT in COVID-19 [56, 57] , and suggested that it could help monitor disease progression and treatment outcomes, particularly by detecting residual activity in mediastinal lymph nodes.
