Fit testing of FFP3/FFP2 masks with facial hair has been largely unsuccessful with colleagues failing fit testing. Where facial hair was maintained for reasons other than religious or cultural it was advised that removal would help with the seal of the FFP3/ FFP2 masks. Whilst some of our medical colleagues have suggested ways in which an adequate seal can be achieved by using a thin cloth tied over a beard for example, currently the efficacy of this method has not been proven widely. Increasingly, it seems that one of the plausible ways to achieve satisfactory",

Regulations were introduced in 2018 to advise on the management and use of dental amalgam as a restorative material. It was advised that amalgam should not be used in children under the age of 15 or women that are breastfeeding or pregnant, unless deemed strictly necessary by the practitioner on the grounds of specific medical needs of the patient. 1 These are unprecedented times in dentistry. Waiting times and the number of patients that require to be seen has grown exponentially, carious lesions may have increased in size due to delays in follow up, cooperation from children may have decreased as desensitisation from regular dental exposure has reduced, and the NHS has come under intensive financial strain. One would ask the question, would composite still be a viable restorative material for this subgroup in these circumstances? Or",

Orthodontic problems (17%) or intra-oral swellings (60%) may result in adverse outcomes the longer operative treatment is delayed. Diagnostic confidence was a highlighted concern. Clinical photographs can improve quality of assessment, however, in the absence of an examination, patients should be 'safety-netted' by providing information specific to the management of their condition should they deteriorate. 4 This can be readily delivered through various forms of telecommunication. 5 As we now witness reopening of 'normal' dental services, clinicians should consider developing systems to incorporate digital-consulting and improve patient resources to enhance teledentistry services.",

Only 29% of referrals included a radiograph or image of the patient. Radiographs are critical in assessing the complexity of treatment that may be required and photographs to assess the degree of facial swellings. It is notable that only a handful of referrers utilised videoconferencing applications to triage patients. We would like to highlight the benefit of doing so in order to more accurately assess patients before referral. It is likely that some degree of social distancing will remain for the foreseeable future, in particular for the most vulnerable of patients. Indeed, the dilemma of patients with active coronavirus requiring assessment will become more common going forward. The use of telemedicine in these circumstances and potentially beyond the current health crisis may be invaluable in allowing for a patient-centred approach.",

We surveyed applications, clinician experiences and conditions presenting for teledentistry amongst 115 clinicians across the UK between 24 April-15 May 2020, during the lockdown restrictions.Most were GDPs (60%) with dental core trainees (17%), foundation dentists and orthodontists (each 5%), oral surgeons (4%), OMFS consultants and speciality doctors (each 3%), dental specialist trainees, special care dentists, and oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) registrars (each 1%). Of the respondents, 76% had no prior experience of teledentistry; 63% had no access to video consulting; 39% sometimes requested photographs of the concerned area; 23% never sent patients further resources; 18% were not confident making diagnoses from telephone consultations alone; 17% couldn't request photographs as systems were unavailable in their workplace; 16% did not feel confident making diagnoses using telephone consultations alongside clinical images and 11% were unsure if these systems were available. Overall, 52% thought teledentistry would remain following the epidemic whilst 21% did not; 27% were unable to commit to a decision.The survey highlighted areas necessitating caution in teledentistry use. Remote consultations may reduce waiting lists and financial implications when patients attend in person. 1 Conditions presenting for teledentistry, such as temporomandibular joint disorders (23%) and pericoronitis (63%), may be suitable for self-care measures, thus minimising patient-clinician contact. Yet, concerns have been raised surrounding antibiotic stewardship and the appropriateness of using teledentistry in isolation to manage",
