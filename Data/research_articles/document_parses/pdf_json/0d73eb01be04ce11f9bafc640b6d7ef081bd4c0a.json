Disease capability to spread among communities are increased rapidly as the number of people that exposed to covid-19 is increasing. This regards evidence of human-to-human transmission indicating that covid-19 is highly contagious. Moreover, covid-19 can also actively live airborne and in surface (3) . These kind of transmissions can form pandemics. Pandemics can cause severe mobility and mortality over wide geographic area (4) . However, the efforts to halt covid-19 spread reduce carbon emission (5) of which advantageous for environment. To withstand spread of covid-19, one natural instrument that rarely discussed is ultraviolet (UV). There are many UV papers prove that it has capability to inactivate virus (6) (7) . An example about virus inactivation by UV is viral inactivation using UV-C irradiation (8) . Even though UV has the ability to inactivate the virus but if the pollution is high it will be meaningless (9) . Note that smoke particulate is able to weaken the UV light ability to exist in the air (10) . Moreover, The vaccine development is not effective and taking a long time to be found (11) . Therefore, urgent, massive and natural immune are somewhat more desirable. Previously, some technologies have been developed by making use of UV light (12) (13) (14) . By aforementioned evidences, we investigate how UV is related to geographical locations and the spread of covid-19 in the world starting from Indonesia. Our assumption is that there is advantage of country like Indonesia where UV index is very high to withstand the spread of covid-19. As information, data sets of world confirmed covid-19, UV index time series, pollution time series, and UV index of Indonesia are gathered from www.github.com/datasets/covid-19/tree/master/data, www.temis.nl/ uvradiation/UVarchive/stations_uv.html (15) , www.aqicn.org, and BMKG 2 .

This level of energy is indicative of how damaging the exposure might be experienced by a person. In general, UV radiation at longer wavelengths is received more abundantly than that at shorter wavelengths. In other words, more UV-A arrives on the surface than UV-B.

However, data from UV radiation is usually reported as a total of integrated UV radiation from a range of wavelengths. As a result, applying the weighting factors cannot be done to specifically determine the contribution of UV radiation from every wavelength. With this compromised situation, an alternative approach has been undertaken to select a weighting factor for a particular wavelength that represents each UV-A and UV-B wavelength range. Since the chosen wavelength can be arbitrary, some reasonable assumptions were provided to serve as justification of calculation. For UV-A, the weighting factor used was selected for the wavelength of 325 nm (UV-A weighting factor = 0.0029).",

During its peak, the model underestimates the observation by more than five units. There are two factors that might be contributed to this difference. Firstly, the model was not able to capture the local characteristics of UV radiation received on the surface in this location. These local characteristics can be associated with the topographical features and the predominant weather conditions in this location. Secondly, the selection of weighting factors to adjust UV-A and UV-B radiation is not suitable for this location. It is possible that the UV radiation received on the surface is at different wavelengths from one place to another. The absorption of UV radiation is governed by atmospheric compositions and weather conditions. Therefore, the amount of energy brought by UV radiation is subject to at what wavelength the radiation is able to reach the surface. This result highlights the importance of future studies that involve more precise measurements on UV radiation from different wavelengths. These studies are required to determine the prevalent wavelength of UV radiation that is measured on the ground.",

By March 2020, this disease has been spreading to at least 178 countries and territories. In some countries, the accumulation of confirmed cases varies from 0 to more than 120000 people over time (Fig. 4a and 4b) . This data shows that this virus has the ability to spread easily and quickly. Indonesia as one of the countries affected by coronavirus shows the number of cases climbing to 1000 people. The number seems to be high but it is still lower when compared to other countries such as America, Italy, France, Netherlands, and Iran. Fig. 4a and 4b show the spread of coronavirus in some countries that less than 5000 confirmed cases and more than 5000 confirmed cases, respectively. The accumulation of confirmed case grows exponentially with different rate in each country. Indonesia grows in very little rate compared to US, Italy, France, Netherlands, and Iran. We can easily cluster those countries by its location using pandemic growth information. For example, referring to Fig. 4a and   4b , Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and India can be grouped into one cluster while US, Italy, France, Netherlands, Iran, Japan, and Russia in another cluster by its tropical and subtropical continent, respectively. Japan, however, has higher UV index compared to US, Italy, and Russia and its UV index grows over time as spring season is coming (Fig. 3a) . Russia that has low population density seems to have anomaly here and of course another parameter such as humidity, air pollution or even economic relation with epicentre country can be taken into account in future studies.",

We can easily understand that the blue and green countries are monotonically increasing over time while the red countries are monotonically decreasing. This phenomenon regards the changing season between cold to summer in northern countries and, conversely from summer to cold season in southern tropical countries. The green countries rarely have UV Index below 6. UV Index behavior of blue, green, and red countries are concurrent with the accumulation of confirmed covid-19 over time inFig.1d. Some blue countries are starting to be sloper as higher UV Index and with proper social distancing.",

The difference between local and global slope is that local slope uses each local point in time frame to estimate the tangent line while the global slope is measured from the last point.
