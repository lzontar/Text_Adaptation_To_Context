The Alter work system's framework and the Rosemann and vom Brocke core BPM elements were used as theoretical lenses to understand the case. The paper describes frustrations of an IT team trying to increase process agility with a BPMS in a large legacy application landscape. The main factors driving this frustration were the difficulty of integrating with other applications and staff bypassing design and code approval procedures. The impact of BPM strategy, culture and governance on BPM methods, resourcing and technology is explained.

The socio-technical model has four components: technology, which includes development tools and the technical platform; structure, which includes the project organization and institutional arrangements; actors, including users, managers and designers; and tasks [20] . The alignment of the elements from these three models is shown in Table 1 . We chose the Core BPM element model as a classification framework for this study's findings. Firstly, as it is more comprehensive than the socio-technical change model, secondly, because we didn't believe information, products and services will dominate in BPMS adoption, and finally because it is specialized for the BPM context. Hence, we argue that the core BPM elements are important not only for BPM but also for BPMS adoption and use. The core BPM elements have been confirmed in some empirical studies. For example, one study noted that to achieve effective BPM solution implementation, the following needs to be achieved: the organisation should have adequate IT infrastructure to support a process orientated architecture; individuals within the organisation should have a comprehensive understanding of process orientated frameworks; and the organisation should have an effective change management process regarding software changes [21] . Successful BPM has been found to depend on employees' attitudes towards embracing BP change [22] , people change management can be extremely challenging [23] and BPM projects frequently fail due to cultural issues [24] . It is also suggested that IT capabilities need to ensure BP efficiency as opposed to rudimentary BP automation [25] . Ensuring that the appropriate tools and IT infrastructure is in place for BPM has also been seen to be critical [17, 26] .
