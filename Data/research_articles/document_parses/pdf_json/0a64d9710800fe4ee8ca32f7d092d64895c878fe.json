To date, few cases of EAE have been reported in the literature; of these, about 40 cases were in adults and fewer than ten cases were in children. Given the rarity of this condition, there are no clear recommendations for its management. Systemic corticosteroids and antimalarials are the most commonly used medications used to treat EAE, but many cases have been reported in the literature that are resistant to treatment with these medications. Here, we present a 65-year-old female with EAE refractory to numerous systemic therapies (corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, doxycycline, methotrexate) who showed a good response to mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mepolizumab therapy in a patient with EAE.

Subsequent treatments with doxycycline (100 mg/day for 8 weeks) or methotrexate (10 mg/week for 6 weeks) were also not effective. Treatment with dapsone (100 mg/day) had to be discontinued after 1 month due to side effects (dyspnoea and haemolytic anaemia). While reviewing the literature, we came across a single case report of Wells syndrome that subsided completely following treatment with mepolizumab for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; formerly referred to as Churg-Strauss syndrome) [18] . Mepolizumab is an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody that has proved to be effective in eosinophilic conditions, including asthma with eosinophilic phenotype, EGPA, chronic eosinophilic leukaemia and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Given the ineffectiveness of the standard treatment options to manage our patient's condition, the presence of dense eosinophilic infiltrates on histopathologic images of the lesions and this report on the efficacy of mepolizumab in a presumably EAE-related entity, we considered initiating our patient on therapy with mepolizumab.

Significant flattening of the lesions and alleviation of itching occurred after the first dose (Fig. 1c,  d) , and nearly complete resolution of skin changes was observed 1 month after the third injection of mepolizumab (Fig. 1e, f) . In addition, the pruritus subsided completely. She did not report any side effects during therapy with mepolizumab. Given the patient's good response, the treatment regimen was extended for another 3 months, but initiation of the treatment had to be postponed due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
