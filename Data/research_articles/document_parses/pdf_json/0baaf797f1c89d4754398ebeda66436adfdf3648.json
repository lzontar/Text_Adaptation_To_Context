            "text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the development of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The infection has appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December of 2019, and has been spread globally. 1 The high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and pulmonary artery (PA) thrombosis, among the inpatients and critically ill patients, have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The overall duplex ultrasound scan (DUS) detected the presence of DVT in 46% of the patients in the general ward and up to 79% of the patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). 10, 11 Proven PE using contrast computed tomography (CT) scan was observed in 30% of all COVID-19 patients. 8 The evidence of small and mid-sized PA thrombosis and microthrombi in alveolar capillaries was found in most of the deceased patients in parallel with the occlusion of big branches of PA in 9-33% of dissections. 12-16 Considering the high incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID-19, most of the current guidelines suggest routine pahrmacoprophylaxis using low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for patients admitted to the hospital. 17-21 Some publications support the intensification of anticoagulation (intermediate to therapeutic doses of heparin) in subjects at individually highest risk for VTE including critical illness, obesity, and high level of D-dimer. 17, 19, 20 The tools mentioned in these publications for VTE risk assessment include: the Caprini score, Padua score, and IMPROVE VTE score. [18] [19] [20] The Padua score was assessed in two papers without a clear correlation with VTE events. 22, 23 To the best of our knowledge, the Caprini and IMPROVE VTE scores have not been validated in COVID-19 patients.",

Also, the elevated D-dimer at admission was assessed as \"acquired\" thrombophilia from the block of 3 scores. We used a liberal or strict approach in the assessment of D-dimer and achieved two different versions of the Caprini score. In the liberal version, we put an additional 3 points for any patient who had elevated D-dimer over the upper limit of normal (ULN: >0,55 mg/L) at the admission. Within the strict version, only patients with D-dimer >3 times ULN (>1,5 mg/L) received the additional 3 points. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, one of the authors (JA Caprini) proposed using a modified score for COVID-19 patients. It adds 2 points for COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic disease, 3 points for those with symptomatic illness, and 5 points for symptomatic patients with a positive D-dimer. This modification also was used for the retrospective analysis. .

The score of \u2265 8 was suggested as an indication for the intensification of pharmacological prophylaxis in the hospital and extended prophylaxis after discharge.
