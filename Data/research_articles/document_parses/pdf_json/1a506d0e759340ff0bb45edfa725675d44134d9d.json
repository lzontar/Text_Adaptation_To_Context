Androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell-line LNCaP-FGC and androgenresistant line LNCaP-r constitute a model for development of androgen resistance in prostate cancer. METHODS. Proteins differently expressed in the two cell-lines were identified by twodimensional (2-D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. HSP60, more abundant in LNCaP-r, was studied by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in specimens of human prostate cancer. RESULTS. HSP60 was upregulated in LNCaP-r, nm23 in LNCaP-FGC, and titin (two isoforms) in either LNCaP-r or LNCaP-FGC. In non-malignant prostate, HSP60-staining was in the glandular compartment, particularly basal epithelial cells. In prostate cancer, most epithelial cells showed moderate-strong staining without apparent correlation between staining intensity and Gleason grade. CONCLUSIONS. The LNCaP-FGC/LNCaP-r model, characterized by 2-D electrophoresis, reveals distinct proteomic alterations. With HSP60, results from cell-lines correlated with clinical results, indicating that this model can be used for dissection of mechanisms involved in transformation to androgen resistance and assignment of protein markers in prostate cancer.",

In the United States, it has been estimated that one in every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime [2] . However, the molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer development and progression still remain largely unknown [3] . Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with clinical phenotypes of varying aggressiveness. Organ-confined prostate cancer can be cured with radical prostatectomy, whereas for patients with advanced tumors the prognosis is generally poor. Androgen ablation therapy remains the most commonly used palliative treatment for advanced prostate cancer and thus far there is no other effective route for treatment of the cancer [4] . The majority of patients will sooner or later develop androgen-resistant prostate cancer (ARPC), thus leading to a mortal outcome of the disease.",

It has been suggested that androgen ablation may put a selective pressure on the prostate cancer cells that will eventually promote the emergence of ARPC cells. These ARPC cells can then restore the signaling pathways mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), following either mutation or amplification of AR [4] or through transactivation of AR by other signaling molecules [5] . In addition, genomic instability has been documented to cause and promote the emergence of ARPC cells [6] [7] [8] . Cytogenetically, ARPC cells can either be very different, even within the same tumor, or have only few additional genomic alterations as compared to the primary tumors. The acquisition of these additional genetic alterations may render the ARPC cells a growth advantage, without the need for stimulation by androgens, as well as the ability to resist the detrimental effect of androgen ablation. However, most of the involved oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes within these altered genomic regions are yet to be identified.",

LNCaP-r is an ARPC cell line that was derived from LNCaP-FGC and characterized in our laboratory [11, 12] . Although LNCaP-r retains many features of LNCaP-FGC such as expression of AR, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), it does not respond by proliferation when stimulated by androgen. Phenotypically, LNCaP-r has achieved a more aggressive behavior compared to LNCaP-FGC. Thus, the two cell lines clearly mimic the clinical situation and provide a potentially useful model system to study the underlying mechanisms involved in transformation of prostate cancer into the androgen resistant state [12, 13] .",

Nevertheless, the mere presence of a protein in a multiple-component spot is still an indicator of its expression. In order to compare the data with clinical cases, we decided to select one protein for a more careful study. A significant finding was the higher concentration of HSP60 in the LNCaP-r cell line and since this protein was identified at a high score and the literature concerning HSP60 and prostate tissue is scanty, we chose this protein for a thorough investigation. In recent years, the biological role of heatshock proteins has been partly revealed [24] . The heatshock proteins can act as molecular chaperones that bind to unfolded or unassembled polypeptides aiding in protein biogenesis according to two general principles: they block non-productive protein-protein interactions and they mediate the folding of proteins to their native state. The HSP60 is present in many different organisms and tissues, and is abundant in most mammalian cells under normal conditions [24] . Aberrant expression of HSP60 has been associated with autoimmune diseases and is thought to have a role in antigen presentation in malignant diseases [25] . The biological role of HSP60 and its possible use as a marker in carcinogenesis has been explored in a few cases. It has also been shown that HSP60, as well as HSP70 and HSP90, are capable of inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by the monocyte-macrophage system [26] .",

In one study, the presence of HSPs 27, 60, and 70 was correlated to prostatic malignancy using immunohistochemistry [27] . It was found that heatshock protein expression independently can predict the clinical outcome in prostate cancer. HSP60 was significantly upregulated in both early and advanced prostate cancer when compared to normal prostatic epithelium. However, no consistent correlation was found between the levels of HSP60 and phenotypic behavior of individual primary prostatic cancers. In another study using similar methods, overexpression of HSP60 was found in early prostate carcinogenesis [28] . These results are in line with our findings for androgen sensitive/resistant prostate cancer, and as a consensus it seems likely that HSP60 in most cases is increased in prostatic cancer tissue but there is no clear correlation to the Gleason score. Previous and current results thus indicate that HSP60 expression may be useful as an independent marker for carcinogenesis.",
