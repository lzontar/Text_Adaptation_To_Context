Therefore, the rapid identification 3 of viruses should be one of the best ways to prevent an outbreak and important implications for 4 medical healthcare. The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious 5 disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus which belongs to the single-stranded, positive-6 strand RNA viruses. The pandemic dimension spread of COVID-19 poses a severe threat to the 7 health and lives of seven billion people worldwide. There is a growing urgency worldwide to 8 establish a point-of-care device for the rapid detection of COVID-19 to prevent subsequent 9 secondary spread. Therefore, the need for sensitive, selective, and rapid diagnostic devices plays 10 a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments and to prevent the epidemics. During the last 11 decade, electrochemical biosensors have emerged as reliable analytical devices and represent a 12 new promising tool for the detection of different pathogenic viruses. This review summarizes the 13 state of the art of different virus detection with currently available electrochemical detection 14 methods. Moreover, this review discusses different fabrication techniques, detection principles, 15 and applications of various virus biosensors. Future research also looks at the use of 16 electrochemical biosensors regarding a potential detection kit for the rapid identification of the 17 COVID-19.",

            "text": "Electrochemical biosensors are the biosensing devices containing electrochemical transducer that . In this review, we will 5 primarily focus on the recent development of impedance-based electrochemical methods, 6 immunosensors and DNA based electrochemical sensors for the detection of various viruses 7 recently reported. An electrochemical biosensor can monitor the activities of living cells or 8 enzymes by measuring the interaction between an analyte and the bioreceptor. In recent years, 9 electrochemical biosensors have shown great success in the fields of medical diagnostics due to 10 their unique properties and easy-to-use platform. Figure 1 represents the potential platform of 11 electrochemical biosensor for the detection of pathogenic viruses. pandemic. Therefore, it is a crying need to establish smart biosensors. Electrochemical 10 impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is considered as an efficient technique, which even detects any 11 tiny changes that occur at the solution-electrode interface. Hence, EIS is widely used to 12 characterize materials, and to monitor binding. Not only rapid response, low limit of detection 13 (LOD), and low cost but also real-time monitoring of the samples attracts extensive research 14 attention towards EIS method rather than using a traditional method like enzyme-linked 15 immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Another benefit of impedimetric methods is that the necessity of 16 enzymatic labels is not required to detect samples. On the other hand, EIS is a well-known 17 technique to investigate the electrical properties of nanomaterials. While interfaces tend to 18 expose to electronically conducting electrodes (Tlili et al., 2006) and (Hleli et al., 2006) . 19 Moreover, EIS has emerged as a powerful tool to quantify signals, because of its capability to 20 separate surface binding from the solution resistance. It is worthy to note that, in the case of antigen assay times could be reduced to a few seconds in serum by moving to an immittance 25 assay from capacitance. Bifunctional self-assembled monolayer (BSAM) formed on electrode 26 surfaces that contain PEG moieties and a tethered redox thiol (See Fig. 2 (A-D) ). The approach 27 leads to the rapid sensitive quantification of NS1 and IgG. 100 Hz optimized frequency was 28 found, and the target-responsive data is shown in Fig. 2E Baek and his team developed electrochemical biosensor by assembling eight peptides 28 severally on Au electrode. Following that, sensitivity towards human noroviruses was conducted.",

After investigating hybridization by non-faradic impedance spectroscopy 21 for different HBV DNA target concentrations they found excellent immobilization, which allows 22 them to detect 50 picomoles of HBV DNA on a sample of 20 \u00b5L without PCR amplification. 23 Further, an electrochemical DNA biosensor was developed to detect HBV with high conductive 24 gold nanorods (GNRs) (Shakoori et al., 2015). They used GNRs except for other emerging 25 nanoparticles like colloidal gold (Cai et al., 2001, Zhang et al., 2004) to increase surface area. 26 They placed GNRs on a modified 1,6-hexanedithiol (HDT) electrode and used [Co(phen) 3 ] 3+ as 27 an indicator to study the immobilization of different DNA sequences. After characterization, they 28 found good specificity with LOD of 2.0\u00d710 -12 mol/L in a linear range from 1.0\u00d710 -12 mol/L to 29 10.0\u00d710 -6 mol/L for target DNA. Additionally, L. Ahangar and M. Mehrgardi in 2017 have 30 reported an DNA-based biosensor where SiO 2 electrode was modified with a nano-porous layer of gold (working electrode) and ssDNA probe were covalently immobilized to trace 1 complementary target element characteristic of HBV. The device was found linearly dynamic 2 and sensitive in the range of 0.4 to 10 nmol of altered DNA showing reliable reproducibility 3 confirmed by EIS and DPV (Ahangar and Mehrgardi, 2017).",

The electrochemical 19 anodization was used to imprint alumina nanoporous membrane-like structure over the platinum 20 wire electrode. DNA capture probe sequence was immobilized on the electrode and hybridized 21 with complementary target DNA for the fabrication of DENV RNA -sensing devices. Later, 22 Oliveira et al. have developed graphite-based probe DNA specific biosensor to diagnose DENV3 23 serotype in human serum having LOD of 3.09 nM (Oliveira et al., 2015). A silicon nanowire-24 based biosensor was proposed by Nuzaihan et al. for detection of the target DNA sequence of 25 DENV with LOD \u223c2.0 fM and sensitivity 45.0 \u03bc AM \u22121 was achieved (Nuzaihan et al., 2016). In 26 another work, Odeh et al. have reported an amperometry biosensor for DENV2 serotype 27 detection with LOD of 17 nM. The sensor is comprised of an immobilized dengue-specific DNA 28 probe on Cu 2 CdSnS 4 quaternary alloy nanostructures deposited on an oxygen-etched silicon 29 substrate (O 2 /Si) (Odeh et al., 2017). Lee et al. reported a sensing platform for norovirus detection by using multi functionalized 1 carbon nanotubes (Lee et al., 2018). They fabricated the target DNA probe with Au/MNP-CNTs 2 which is magnetically aligned on Pt-integrated electrode (PtIDE). A carbon chain (C6) based 3 spacer was employed in the hybridization process. Under the magnetic field, nanomaterials can 4 spread out well on the PtIDE electrode and enhanced sensing performance. Compared to other 5 non-aligned platforms this method shows increased sensing behavior with different 6 concentrations of target DNA (1 pM to 10 nM) and confirmed the LOD around 8.8 pM. They 7 also performed the selectivity test on influenza and ZKV virus DNA but among them, norovirus 8 DNA shows an excellent response. 9 Recently, a promising DNA-based biosensor incorporated with silsesquioxane-functionalized 10 gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-SiPy) modified glassy carbon electrode (oxidized) was introduced 11 and showed selective performance for early-stage ZIKV diagnosis with LOD of 0.82 pM within 12 2 hours (Steinmetz et al., 2019). Device performance was afterword intensely investigated by 13 CV, EIS and AFM analysis which confirmed selective detection of ZIKV. The prescribed 14biosensor was also found stable and reusable after each use and performance restored around 15 98.0% of its initial response after 90 days.",
