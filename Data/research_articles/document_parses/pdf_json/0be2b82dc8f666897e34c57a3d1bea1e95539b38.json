Non-centered principal component analysis plus varimax rotation (nodal component analysis) is applied to overstory and understory data in order to detect vegetational noda. The overstory data are inherently more structured (i.e., contain more distinct subgroups) than those of the understory. An exception is seen with groups in which Abies balsa mea plays a prominent role. These are interpreted as stages in various successions of which only one, a Betula papyrifera to A. balsamea sequence, represents the complete transition from one canopy dominant to another.",

This may be due to opposing summer cooling from James and Hudson's Bays and winter climatic amelioration from the Great Lakes.

If disjoint submatrix groups of species and stands occur in a data table then non-centered PCA will extract these in decreasing sequence of submatrix order and internal homogeneity (Noy-Meir 1973 , Feoli 1977 . Such components are unipolar, each being oriented from the common origin in data space to the center (centroid) of a submatrix cluster. In reality, vegetation data are continuous with submatrix groups showing more or less overlap. Non-centered PCA of such data results in some components becoming bipolar because they account for more variation between submatrix groups.

However, their breakdown into size class \"pseudospecies\" emphasizes where, in the predominantly monospecific forest complex, interspecific mingling can be attributed to differences in tree size. By implication, such mixed noda indicate intermediate stages in succession from one forest type to another in sufficient qual}tity as to be of ecological significance. Successional interpretation.-At R = lO only one group, nodum 2, emerges as a mixture of tree species. This is an upland stand complex characterized by terminal loadings of size class 1 (saplings) of Abies balsamea. At R = 20 this group fragments into various phases in which the dominant trees are emphasized. Thus terminal loadings consist of A. balsamea saplings plus larger size classes of other species, notably Betula papyrifera (nodum 13), Picea glauca (nodum 15), and P. glauca plus Populus tremuloides (nodum 18). The terminal loadings of significance are indicated in Fig. 2 .",

Thus the values shown for stand soil moisture (Fig. 4) are averages of this discrete scale and the trend seen reflects a somewhat curved right-to-left gradient of increasing soil moisture on the ordination. Broadly correlated with this trend are increases in values for field soil pH, and extractable soil calcium and magnesium (not shown). In opposition the values for soil phosphorus indicate a gradient from left to right and those for potassium are concentrated in the central region, representing stands on clay-rich substrata. While the overall relationships among these environmental variables are complex, there can be little doubt that the high levels of calcium in the vascular peats of sites within nodum 7 are due to exchange processes with calcium-rich subsurface water which shows marked rates of lateral movement through the substrate (Dai 1971) . Such sites are often transitional between upland clay areas and riverbanks. Also the discrepancy between field pH readings of wet peat samples and laboratory pH values on dried samples from stands within nodum 7 showed differences as great as two pH units, whereas these paired values showed close agreement for the bottomland sites of nodum 8. Dimension 1 is therefore interpreted as a combined site moisture and nutrient-related gradient. However, because certain nutrients follow opposing trends, one might expect optimum combinations for some plants to be found in sites of the central part of the ordination.",

Indeed a cut-off of noda 2, 3, 7, ll, and 12 from the remainder is in-dicated. The ombrotrophic bog forests (nodum 2) and pine forests (nodum 3) represent nutrient-poor ecosystems in which mineralization processes are slow (Weetman 1962 , Miller et at. 1979 . Noda 1, 4, 5, 13, and 22 include a high proportion of broad-leaved tree species and the smaller depths of organic matter suggest a faster rate of mineralization and nutrient turnover. At the upper extreme, noda 8 and 14 include many bottomland sites.

However, the method is not inherently hierarchic and, as used here, the dendrogram provides insight into the structure of the data in order to focus attention upon an informative level of varimax rotation. Here, the overstory data set includes more distinct submatrix groups than that of the understory; hence the number of unipolar components emerging at higher levels of rotation is correspondingly greater even though the stands sampled are identical.",

Environmental relationships of the overstory noda could be presented, as for the understory noda, but this adds little to the results of the earlier paper. However, nodal component analysis of the tree stem data does supply more precise information on the stands involved in a successional sequence where the ordering of noda along such a sequence is clear. In this respect, the birch to fir succession (Fig. 6 ) emerges as the only complete transition from one canopy dominant to another. A relatively truncated successional development would seem more typical of the region as exemplified by the aspen sequence of noda 17 and 4.",

The former traditional perspective is adopted here to emphasize that, under the most conservative interpretation, the changes associated with overstory composition through time are not persistent and seem to be repeated frequently across the regional landscape. Thus the emphasis in explaining vegetation composition is on the successful re-establishment of plant species following catastrophic forest destruction, notably by fire. The influence of this dominant environmental influence on the overstory composition and population biology of the tree species is discussed in Carleton and Maycock (1978) . It is pertinent to consider whether forest fire also influences the understory composition in such a strong manner.",

However, many understory species possess this resprouting ability. Beasleigh and Yarranton (1974) demonstrate the persistence of the deep-lying rhizome of Equisetum sylvaticum belowground with a minimum energy expenditure in aboveground plant parts. Similarly, Trientalis borealis is well adapted to resprouting after fire from persistent subterranean tubers (Anderson and Loucks 1973) . Ericaceous shrubs including Kalmia angustifolia, Ledum groenlandicum, Vaccinium angustifolium, and V. myrtilloides have also been shown to regenerate from underground plant parts following destruction of aerial parts by fire (Smith and Sparling 1966, Tucker and Jarvis 1967) . In this respect the autecology of other abundant understory species such as Cornus canadensis, Maianthemum canadense, and Clintonia borealis should be of interest with respect to their capacity for regeneration. Ahlgren (1960) found that these three species reappeared rapidly following prescribed fire along with many other abundant species in common with this study.",
