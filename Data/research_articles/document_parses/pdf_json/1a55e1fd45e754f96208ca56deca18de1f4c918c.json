The report recalls the aim of the Paris Agreement to hold \"the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 \u2022 C above pre-industrial These findings seem at odds with the rather slow global progress towards reaching commitments in line with the Paris Agreement, including insufficient and comparatively slow policy responses. The facts, today, are clear: If we want to ensure the long-term growth and prosperity of our global economies, we must take the threats arising from climate change and environmental degradation seriously and fundamentally reform the way our economies operate. By way of illustration, Table 1 shows the projected impact of selected events and developments related to unmitigated climate change and rising levels of pollution on mortality rates and GDP growth.

Some point towards the fact that the threat posed by climate change and environmental degradation is so large, so all encompassing, with such a perceived lack of ready-made solutions, we instinctively turn towards ignorance and surrender. 5 For policy-makers this has meant a non-systemic approach and narrow focus on 'other priorities', such as jobs and growth, in manner that is detached from the broader context of impeding biodiversity and climate tipping points and their potentially devastating impacts on the delivery of these priorities. In this context, Wallace-Wells remarks that \"scientists spent decades presenting the unambiguous data, demonstrating to anyone who would listen just what kind of crisis will come for the planet if nothing is done, and then watched, year after year, as nothing was done.\" 6 While the purpose of this paper is not to make the economic case for the sustainability transition itself, it is important to note that despite the well-documented economic case for integrating sustainability considerations in economic 7 and financial or investment 8 decision-making, preciously little was done until 2018.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 171, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 740, "end": 743, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 797, "end": 800, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1415, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1426, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1444, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1466, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1590, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2018, "end": 2019, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2596, "end": 2597, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "On the contrary, it is only in the last two years, that policy-makers have stopped considering sustainability as a \"nice to have\" and have started viewing it as a necessity if our economic systems are to continue functioning over the long-term. This false dichotomy, whereby policy-makers have argued that jobs and growth take precedence over sustainability, rather than acknowledging that the former is ultimately dependent on the latter, has informed the previously lukewarm policy responses that are elaborated in the next section. In addition, this approach may have contributed to increasing climate scepticism among European citizens, which in turn re-confirms the beliefs of, in particular, policy-makers at Member State level, that their focus should be anywhere but on climate-related and environmental issues. For instance, the results of a 2017 study carried out by Tvinnereim et al. on public opinions surrounding the topic of climate change indicate that citizens are generally willing \"to accept stronger mitigation action, but also that central and local governments need to facilitate low-carbon choices, bridging policy and individual action to mitigate climate change\". 9 Arguably, policy responses have not yet been strong enough to facilitate these low-carbon choices for consumers. This cautious 'hands-off' approach to policy-making in the area of sustainability may have also increased the prevalence of a certain type of climate scepticism, so-called \"response scepticism\" among citizens and business owners, confirming to policy-makers that their primary focus should not be on mitigating climate change 7 See for instance research by the New Climate Economy, who argue that bold climate action could deliver at least USD26 trillion in net global economic benefits between now and 2030 compared to business-as-usual. This includes creating more than 65 million new low-carbon jobs by 2030. Available at: https://newclimateeconomy.report/2018/. 8 Incorporating sustainability issues is a source of investment value and neglecting sustainability-related analyses may cause the mispricing of risk and poor asset allocation decisions. It can therefore be a failure of fiduciary responsibility to not take into account relevant sustainability considerations. In particular, systemic issues, like climate change or companies' social standards, may significantly alter the investment rationale for particular sectors, industries and geographies and may have generalised negative impacts on economic output. Hence, the consideration of sustainability issues should nowadays be considered one of the core characteristics of a prudent investment process. See for instance research and statements on this topic by investors worldwide, available at: https://www.fiduciaryduty21.org/signatories.html. 9 G\u00f6k\u00e7in [10] , p. 102. and environmental degradation. 10 According to Capstick and Pidgeon, two principal forms of scepticism relating to climate change in particular can be observed: so-called \"epistemic scepticism, relating to doubts about the status of climate change as a scientific and physical phenomenon; and response scepticism, relating to doubts about the efficacy of action taken to address climate change.\" 11 Contrary to popular belief, it is response scepticism that \"is more strongly associated with a lack of concern about climate change\" and should thus warrant \"additional effort [to] be directed towards addressing and engaging with people's doubts concerning attempts to address climate change.\" 12 In essence, the solution could be to take stronger policy action towards mitigating climate change and environmental degradation, focusing on providing solutions that will trickle down to the individual consumer, in turn allowing them to trust that policy action is sufficient.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1188, "end": 1189, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1970, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2814, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2822, "end": 2826, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2870, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3233, "end": 3235, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3530, "end": 3532, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "So if the science on climate change, today, is clear and there are strong indications that citizens can support stronger policy actions and that soft action increases scepticism among citizens, why has it taken EU policy-makers so long to change their approach and scientists so long to be more vocal about the alarming rates of global warming and environmental degradation? Hansen suspects the existence of what he calls the 'John Mercer effect'. John Mercer was one of the first scientists to suggest in 1978 \"that global warming from burning of fossil fuels could lead to disastrous disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet, with a sea level rise of several meters worldwide.\" Hansen remarks that in his own work he observed \"scientists who disputed Mercer, suggesting that his paper was alarmist, [were] treated as [. . . ] more authoritative\" than those who supported Mercer's conclusions. He further argues that those scientists who were \"preaching caution and downplaying the dangers of climate change fared better in receipt of research funding.\" 13 This sort of reticence has historically made \"the IPCC conclusions,\" which, up until SR1.5 in 2018, were comparatively cautious in nature, \"authoritative and widely accepted.\" 14 Wallace-Wells supports this hypothesis when stating that there are \"few things with a worse reputation\" than \"'alarmism' among those studying climate change.\" 15 He thus attributes the fact that climate scientists have in the past tended to err on the side of caution, among other things, to the tendency of climate deniers to \"capitalise on any overstatement or erroneous prediction as proof of illegitimacy or bad faith.\" 16 The result has been a widening gap between what scientists know about climate change and its impacts and the forcefulness with which they have communicated their findings to policy-makers and the public. 17 However, the publication of the SR1.5 created a visible shift in the way in which scientists and subsequently policy-makers approached 10 Ibid. 11 Ibid. 12 Ibid. 13 Hansen [11] , p. 1. 14 Hansen [11] , p. 5. 15 Wallace-Wells [2] , p. 155. 16 Wallace-Wells [2] , p. 156. 17 Hansen [11] , p. 5. and communicated about the climate and environmental crises. Wallace-Wells comments on this shift in 2018, when remarking that \"scientists began embracing fear\", as \"the IPCC released a dramatic, alarmist report illustrating just how much worse climate change would be at 2 degrees of warming compared with 1.5.\" 18 This paper argues that this shift in narrative among scientists and subsequently EU policy-makers has also influenced the way in which sustainable finance was approached at EU level after 2018.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1061, "end": 1063, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1242, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1404, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1667, "end": 1669, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1874, "end": 1876, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2014, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2023, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2030, "end": 2032, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2039, "end": 2041, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2049, "end": 2053, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2062, "end": 2064, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2076, "text": "Hansen [11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2085, "end": 2087, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2102, "end": 2105, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2116, "end": 2118, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2136, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2147, "end": 2149, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2161, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Sustainable finance, as many other policy developments related to the sustainability transition, first gained in prominence among policy-makers with the signature of the Paris Agreement in 2015, in particular Art. 2.1c:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Financing the sustainability transition"}, {"text": "This Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Financing the sustainability transition"}, {"text": "(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. 19 This provision gave prominence to a fact that policy-makers had been acutely aware of for some time: transitioning our economy towards more sustainable, low-carbon, and more resource-efficient modalities will require huge amounts of investments, both from public and private sources. In recognising this simple fact, the European Commission (Commission) recently published the European Green Deal Investment Plan. It stipulates that reaching our current 2030 energy and climate targets will require additional annual investments of at least \u20ac260 bn, while reaching some of the EU's environmental policy objectives will require additional annual investments of \u20ac100-150 bn. 20 Given the size of the EU budget, which in 2019 amounted to approximately \u20ac165 bn, it is abundantly clear that these types of investments require a fundamental reform of the EU financial sector, in order to be able to support European companies in this transition.

They subsequently zoomed in on the topics they felt needed to be tackled first and foremost and presented, as requested, a sequencing and priorisation of actions and recommendations, first through their interim report, published in July 2017, and then through their final report, published in January 2018.

Arguably, the Commission proposal, published on 24 May 2018 and months before the SR1.5, was still informed by a notion of caution among policy-makers, based on a narrative that encouraged market actors to take into account sustainability, without directly requiring the majority of the market to do so.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Commission proposal"}, {"text": "The Commission proposal intended to set out uniform criteria for determining whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable.

It would help to ensure that investment decisions favoured economic activities that are genuinely providing a substantial contribution to the achievement of climate-related and environmental objectives, while also complying with minimum social and governance standards. This would in turn facilitate cross-border access to capital for sustainable investments, as there would only be one single classification system for Member States to draw from when developing sustainability-related standards or labels.

Instead, it set out a framework to facilitate sustainable investments, when providing a tool that could be used flexibly by financial market participants and Member States, in order to develop products, standards, or labels, which they claim are green. Ultimately, it would be for the market and the consumer to decide whether the level of ambition is high enough for a product to qualify as green, based on the required disclosure as part of the Taxonomy Regulation.

However, the minimum social safeguards were significantly strengthened to include the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the International Bill of Human Rights. The Commission was empowered to develop criteria for determining compliance with these safeguards as well as asked to conduct an impact assessment on a potential further extension of these safeguards. Similarly, the tasks of the Platform on Sustainable Finance (article 15) were enlarged, among other things, to also comprise assistance to the Commission on defining possible social objectives.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Parliament report after the plenary vote"}, {"text": "The Council negotiating position 35 reflected the fault lines between Member States, which were fundamentally different from those observed during the negotiations in the Parliament, as well as the generally lower level of ambition of some national governments. Rather than increasing the scope of the Taxonomy Regulation, discussions steered by some Member States were instead focused on limiting the application of the Regulation and increasing the involvement of Member States in the definition of the technical screening criteria. The difficulties in reaching an agreement in the Council were reflected in the fact that the file was handled by three different presidencies: Austria, Romania, and Finland. It was only under the Finnish Presidency that EU ambassadors gave their green light on 25 September 2019 to a common position, allowing the process of trilogues to start. The Council's fault lines were fundamentally influenced by the realities on the ground and the different perceptions of Member States with regards to the severity of the climate threat. The statements by different Member States, attached to the common position, reflected this fact, and appeared to be largely influenced by the general narratives existing in those Member States around the largesse of the climate and environmental crisis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Council negotiating position"}, {"text": "The Council position put forward a hybrid approach of delegated and implementing acts, whereby the principles and metrics for the technical screening criteria, as well as the 'do no significant harm' criteria, would be covered by a delegated act, while the specific threshold for substantial contribution of each economic activity would be decided by way of an implementing act. This is a fundamental departure from the Commission's proposal, as it significantly increases the influence of Member States over the setting of thresholds and criteria, and poses a risk of delaying the adoption process of these criteria, given the divergent views on climate-related and environmental issues between Member States. In addition, the Council also added a 'Member States Expert Group' to advise the Commission on the appropriateness of the technical screening criteria to further increase their influence over the criteria-setting process.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Details of the Council's position"}, {"text": "In this context, a myriad of statements by different Member States and groups of Member States reflected the dominant narratives surrounding the climate threat that exist in those countries. Among them were a joint statement by Germany, Luxembourg, and Austria, expressing their concerns that nuclear energy might qualify under the taxonomy and a similar statement by Greece clearly showing the country's position that nuclear energy should not be able to qualify as sustainable. In contrast, a statement by Poland focused on explaining that the compromise proposal does not take into account the different points of departure of Member States, nor the diversity of their energy mixes and their individual paths towards a sustainable energy system. This statement in particular reflects the primacy of national concerns surrounding energy security and a potentially slower speed of the sustainability transition, over the scientific evidence that certain types of energy sources can lead to carbon-intensive lock-in, and are as such not compatible with reaching the Paris goals.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Details of the Council's position"}, {"text": "Importantly, the political compromise was finalised within less than two months and the text that was agreed 36 reflected a level of ambition that was absent in the Commission proposal.

On 9 October, only weeks before the start of the trilogues, President-elect Ursula von der Leyen published her political guidelines, which she had originally presented on 16 July 2019, in her capacity as candidate for the President of the Commission. In this publication, the first of her six headline ambitions, or proposed Commission priorities, was titled \"A European Green Deal.\" 37 Moreover, the general narrative surrounding climate change and environmental degradation was bolder than what had been presented by Jean-Claude Juncker five years prior, on 15 July 2014. While the latter was very much focused on \"jobs, growth, and investment\", Von der Leyen's guidelines had the \"aspiration [. . . ] of living in a natural and healthy continent.\" 38 While the Juncker Commission made \"A Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy\" the third of its priorities, it continued to be narrowly focused on diversifying Europe's energy sources, in order to reduce the energy dependency of Member States. 39 Making \"Europe's Energy Union [. . . ] the world number one in renewable energies\" was justified by \"not only [being] a matter of a responsible climate change policy\" but rather about having \"affordable energy in the medium term\" and building on \"the potential of green growth.\" 40 It reflected very much the sentiment that sustainability was considered a \"nice to have\", in addition to other priorities that were viewed in isolation from it.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Arriving at a political compromise and a European Green Deal"}, {"text": "On the other hand, the European Green Deal, unveiled on 11 December 2019, took a more holistic and radical approach. It set out \"to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.\" 41 Against this backdrop, a tool like the Taxonomy Regulation ceased to be a \"nice to have\" and became an absolute necessity. This was also acknowledged in the European Green Deal Investment Plan, the investment pillar of the European Green Deal, which was published shortly thereafter. In order to \"mobilise at least EUR 1 trillion of sustainable investments over the next decade through the EU budget\", as announced in the investment plan, and to \"create an enabling framework for private investors and the public sector\", there needs to be 37 Von der Leyen [16] , p. 4. 38 Von der Leyen [16] , p. 3. 39 Juncker [17] , p. 6. 40 Ibid. a high degree of clarity on what can be considered a sustainable investment.

Much of this debate is limited in usefulness because it hinges on the same sort of binary thinking and cognitive dissonance that dominated the debate among policy-makers before the publication of SR1.5. Overcoming the false dichotomy that governs many of these discussions will be the defining task for European policymakers for some years to come.
