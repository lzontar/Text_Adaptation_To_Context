            "text": "Introduction: Recently, a network of Orthogeriatric and Orthopedic Units (Gruppo Italiano di OrtoGeriatria, GIOG) was created in Italy to collect data of older patients admitted to hospital wards after hip fracture (HF). We report some data regarding the detection of postoperative delirium (POD). Methods: 2570 patients (76.3% females) aged [ 65 years were recruited in 14 hospitals after HF from 2016 to March 2018 . Information about residence before fracture, pre-operative cognitive impairment (POCI), type of anaesthesia and involvement of a geriatrician as consultant were collected. POD development was assessed on the 1st day after surgery with routinely employed instruments. Multivariate logistic p-values are reported. Results: POD occurred in 636 patients (24.7%), with huge heterogeneity among centers (11.7-38.8%, p \\ 0.001). Delirium was significantly associated with gender (30.6% female vs. 22.9% male, OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1), age (30.0% C 85 years vs. 18.2% \\ 85 years, OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.1); POCI (40% severe POCI vs. no-POCI, OR = 5.6, 95% CI 4.0-7.9); geriatric involvement (25.1% yes vs. 19.2% no, OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1. 3-6.4) . No association was found between POD and type of anesthesia (24.8% general vs 24.7% other, p = 0.38) and living at home before fracture (23.9% yes vs 33.5% no, p = 0.86). No significant difference in median time from hospitalization to surgery was found between patients with POD (42.0 h; I-III quartiles 24.0-63.3) and those without POD (40.0 h, I-III quartiles 23.0-58.0; p = 0.59). Conclusions: We found a huge heterogeneity in delirium detection among centres, at least partially related to patient and organizational characteristics. Diffusion of tools to systematically detect delirium is urgently required.",

Cross-sectional data were analyzed using path analysis. Results: Low motor performance had significant direct effects on FES-I (p B 0.01), whereas 1-item FoF was significantly and directly determined by fall-related posttraumatic stress (p B 0.05). Posttraumatic stress significantly mediated the effects of high psychological inflexibility on 1-item FoF (indirect effect, p B 0.05). Being female (p B 0.01) and history of falls (p B 0.01) were significantly and directly associated with low perceived ability to manage falls. Discussion: Results indicate that the assessment of fall-related concerns by FES-I during an early stage of stationary rehabilitation maybe is insufficient to capture FoF in its whole nature. FES-I targets fall-related concerns related to activities of daily living which cannot be performed by hip fracture during the early stage of recovery. In this context the relevance of psychological inflexibility and posttraumatic stress symptoms was emphasized.",

The aim of this study is to develop and validate a prediction model for the onset of functional decline in 3-year follow-up in young older adults aged 65-75 years. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of four population-based cohorts, including participants of 65-75 years old who reported no functional limitations at baseline. Functional decline was assessed with two items on basic ADL and three items on instrumental ADL. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to develop a prediction model, with subsequent bootstrapping for optimism-correction. We applied internal-external cross-validation to assess model discrimination and calibration across the cohorts. Results: 2560 people were included (mean age 69.7 \u00b1 3.0 years, 47.4% female) of whom 572 (22.3%) reported functional decline at three-year follow-up. The final prediction model contained 10 out of 22 predictors: age, handgrip strength, gait speed, five-repeated chair stands time (non-linear association), body mass index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, and depressive symptoms. The optimism-corrected model showed good discrimination with a C statistic of 0.72. Calibration intercept was 0.06 and calibration slope was 1.05. Internal-external cross-validation showed consistent performance of the model across the four cohorts. Conclusions: Based on pooled cohort data analyses we showed that the onset of functional decline in ADL in three years in people aged 65-75 years can be predicted by specific physical performance measures, age, body mass index, depressive symptoms, and chronic conditions.

            "text": "Introduction: This project aims to measure the effect of a clinical pharmacist on trans-sectoral adherence in terms of drug therapy safety and hospital readmissions. Methods: The study is conducted as a before/after comparison and will end in 12/2019 (clinicaltrials NCT03412903). In the ongoing control phase, the pharmacist only surveys the patient's medication history. In the following second phase, he will additionally ascertain the patient's adherence and carry out a thorough medication review. Finally, he will prepare a comprehensive paragraph in the discharge report discussing medication changes and persisting drug interactions. This shall provide the general practitioner (GP) with all necessary information aiming a broader acceptance of discharge medication. Apart from the main outcome-i.e. number of hospital readmissions and days spent at home within 6 months after discharge-the time to readmission, differences between pharmaceutical/medical medication history ascertainment and the acceptance of the supposed medication regime by the GP will be analysed. Preliminary results: 28 patients have been meanwhile included since 02/2018. In 10 cases the medication histories showed clinical relevant mistakes; three cases were inconclusive. The mean time spent at home was 16.8 days in the first month (n = 15, SD = 12.32) with four reported hospital readmissions. In 6 of 17 cases, drug therapy recommendations were not accepted by the GP. Clinical Relevance: First results of AGITATE show a relevant information loss regarding drug therapy at the interface of out-and inpatient care, which could potentially harm the patient. The first phase will serve as a comparison for the second phase, in which a clinical pharmacist provides counselling for both patients and medical professionals. The effect of this service on all outcomes will be evaluated. O-36 Fifty percent reduction of falls and fractures among elderly in nursing homes Christian Moln\u00e1r 1 1 Familjel\u00e4karna S\u00c4 BO Fall-related injuries is one of the most common causes of death and reduced life quality among elderly in Sweden. With the goal to halve the incidence of falls and fractures we developed a new way of organising the multiprofessional team around patients living in nursing-homes, together with the establishment of a small central organisation collecting data and presenting regular feed-back to the team. Two year follow-up data shows a stable decline of the number of falls and fractures by more than 50% in the units working according to the new method as opposed to units not yet having implemented it. These results implicate a persistent and somewhat surprisingly great effect of the importance of how we organise the multiprofessional team around the patient in preventing falls and fallrelated injuries.",

However, influence of cognitive impairment (CI) on the mortality after PCI hasn't been estimated, so that we estimated it herein targeting very elderly patients. Methods: We retrospectively examined 102 patients above 80 years old who were performed PCI from 2012 to 2014 at our facility. We categorized them into the CI group (less than 20 points by Mini-Mental State Examination and/or already diagnosed as CI by neurologists) and the non-CI group. We then evaluated the cardiac mortality during 1 year after PCI in both groups, and estimated the involvement of CI on the cardiac mortality by multivariate analysis adjusted for classical risk factors and CI. Furthermore, in the CI group, we estimated the prognostic factors including family structure on the cardiac mortality. Results: Among 102 patients, 42 were in the CI group. The cardiac mortality was 68 and 24% in the CI and the non-CI groups, respectively (OR 4.5, , P \\ 0.05). In all subjects, CI was the independent predictor of the cardiac mortality with 12.9 of OR (95% CI 1.5-211.5, P \\ 0.05). Additionally, in the CI group, patients, living only with a partner who was also suffering from CI, were independently predisposed to higher risk on cardiac death (P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest the CI significantly influence the cardiac mortality after PCI, and we should consider the patient's living surroundings including family structure. O-38 Repeated cerebrospinal fluid removal procedure in older patients with Idiopathic Normotensive Hydrocephalus ineligible for surgical treatment common in patients without OH (p = 0.02). At multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.03; p = 0.02), nitrates (OR 9.95; p = 0.04), alpha-blockers (OR 2.58; p = 0.05) and benzodiazepine (OR 2.41 ; p = 0.01) were predictors of OH; ACEi (OR 0.53; p = 0.01) showed a protective role. If analysis was stratified by age, ARB were predictive of OH in patients aged 80 or older (OR 13.72; p = 0.007) . Conclusions: OH is frequent in hypertensive patients. Age, nitrates, alpha-blockers and benzodiazepine are predictive of OH, whereas ACEi have a protective role. ARB are associated with a higher risk of OH in patients aged 80 or older. O-41 QT Dispersion in masked hypertention: an arrhythmogenic risk factor (G-MASH-QT) Introduction: Detection of blood pressure above normal limits with ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) when office measurements are normal is defined as masked hypertension (MH) 1 . QT dispersion (QTd) is defined as the difference between the longest QT interval and the shortest QT interval in 12-channel electrocardiography (ECG), and it increases the risk of arrhythmia 3 . Hypertension is known to cause QTd, but the relationship between MH and QTd was not previously examined. Our aim was to examine the relationship between MH and QTd. Methods: 74 normotensive patients were enrolled. MH was diagnosed by ABPM according to ESC13 guidelines. Patients with atrial fibrillation, branch block, ST segment changes, those using drugs that can affect QT, and patients with coronary artery disease were excluded. In the V1-V6 leads, the QT intervals were measured, the minimum-maximum values were determined and their difference was recorded in milliseconds. QTd was compared in patients with and without MH. Results: MH was detected in 30 (40%) patients with a mean age of 71.0 \u00b1 5.9. QTd was significantly higher in the MH group than the normal group [52 (0-100) vs. 40 (0-80), respectively; p: 0.025]. Logistic regression analysis showed that MH was associated with QTd and increased the risk 3.4-fold (p: 0.017; OR: 3.4; %95 CI 1. 2-9.2) . Conclusions: In this study, an arrhythmogenic indicator QTd was found to be significantly higher in masked hypertension. QTd is related to life span, cardiac mortality, and cerebrovascular events. Therefore, the relationship between QTd and MH is very striking. ECG of all MH patients should be examined and it should be known that they are at risk for arrhythmia. Background: Hospital readmission risk is high in multimorbid patients aged C 75 years old. A condition of ''hospital-dependence'' may arise: patients get adapted to the hospital care and, once discharged, may experience quick health status decline, requiring readmission despite appropriate treatments. The clinical characteristics of this patient-category are still poorly investigated. Aim: To retrospectively describe the characteristics of 118 patients aged C 75 who were urgently admitted to Parma University-Hospital, the only hospital facility of the district, at least 4 times in 2015. Methods: For each patient and admission, data on multimorbidity (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale Comorbidity Score, CIRS-CS, and Severity Index, CIRS-SI), frailty (Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale, RCFS), functional dependence, mobility, polypharmacy, caregiver, length of stay (LOS) and interval between consecutive admissions were extrapolated from clinical records. Mortality during the years 2015 and 2016 was assessed on the institutional database. Results: At the first admission, patients (72 F, age 83.7 \u00b1 4.9) had a high burden of polypharmacy (median number of drugs 8.5, IQR 6-11) and multimorbidity (CIRS-CS 15.8 \u00b1 4.1, CIRS-SI 2.9 \u00b1 1.1). However, most (55.5%) were fit or pre-frail according to RCFS (score [1] [2] [3] [4] . At multivariate models, CIRS-SI was significantly correlated with LOS (b \u00b1 SE 2.32 \u00b1 0.92, p = 0.01) and readmission interval (b \u00b1 SE -22.92 \u00b1 9.84, p = 0.03). By the end of 2016, 66% of patients had died. Baseline frailty (RCFS [ 4) was the only significant predictor of mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14-2.30, p = 0.007). Conclusions: At baseline, most patients with multiple readmissions had severe multimorbidity and polypharmacy, but exhibited an unexpectedly low prevalence of frailty/disability. When present, frailty represented the main risk factor for mortality.",

It is described that this knowledge is often insufficient, but the level of this insufficiency is unclear. Aim: Gain insight into the current level of applied knowledge of pharmacotherapy and polypharmacy of residents and consultants. Secondarily, the trainability on the knowledge by an online course was studied. Methods: The applied knowledge of pharmacotherapy and polypharmacy of residents and consultants from different clinical specialties were assessed, using formative multiple choice assessments as part of an online course regarding frail older patients. Explanatory variables to predict the level of knowledge were studied. The effects of an online course were studied using repeated ANOVA. Results: 448 residents and 331 consultants were included in 2016-2017. They had a mean pre-test score in pharmacotherapy of 74% (SD 15.5) vs 72% (SD 15.2) and polypharmacy pre-test score of 75% (SD 14.3) and 74% (SD 16.5) , respectively (p = 0.01). Surgical specialties had lower pre-test scores compared to those with a medical specialty (p \\ 0.001). There were no predicting variables for higher scores. With the course as intervention, an increase in scores of both groups (within groups, p \\ 0.001) was obtained with a betweengroup difference between surgical and medical specialty (p = \\ 0.001). Clinical specialty appeared to influence the increase of knowledge of pharmacotherapy (p = 0.006). Conclusions: Differences in basic applied knowledge of pharmacotherapy and polypharmacy were seen between clinical specialties, with surgical specialities having a slightly lower level. No differences were found between residents and consultants. An online course can increase the level of knowledge in both medical and surgical specialties.",

Results: Recognition of clinical uncertainty is the first step: labelling the vague, unpleasant feeling as such. Some residents link that feeling to personal functioning, others to the complexity of the patient. Everyone recognises uncertainty as a source of distress. To enhance coping discussions with fellow residents, in broader discussion groups and one-on-one, are helpful. Explicitly labelling the aspect of clinical uncertainty in discussions with faculty provides space for reflection and diminishes a feeling of loneliness in complex situations.

In this study, we examined predictive abilities of deficits in physical and cognitive domains of the KCL for independency and survival during 3 years. Method: Of all senior residents in the Higashiura town, the municipal government identified independent older residents who were uncertified by the long-term care insurance (LTCI). We sent the KCL to the residents and asked them to send it back to us after answering all questions. We finally selected older residents who filled in all questions of the KCL as the eligible subject. Baseline characteristics and the data on KCL of the subjects were registered. Information about an incident LTCI certification and death in 3 years was given by the municipal government. Results: We classified the subjects into 4 groups based on the deficits in physical and cognitive domains of the KCL (no deficit [ND] ; n = 3286, only cognitive deficit [CD] ; n = 1413, only physical deficit [PD] ; n = 387, and both deficits [BD] ; n = 456). Compared with ND, the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age and sex indicated that CD, PD and BD significantly predicted the risk of dependency, with the hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.633, 2.470, and 3.642 , respectively. On the other hand, the mortality could be significantly predicted in the BD with a HR of 2.764. Conclusion: Both physical and cognitive deficits in the KCL showed a significant predictive ability of the incident dependency and mortality.",

Multivariate analyses with functional components as the dependent variables and the DBI as the independent variable were conducted. Analyses were adjusted for comorbidities, cognitive status, Timed Up and Go, Geriatric Depression Scale and frailty as covariates. Results: Five functional components were extracted representing, 'Regularity', 'Pace', 'Synchronization', 'Stability', and 'Variability'. The DBI was associated with 'Pace' (F(2,181) = 4.07, p = 0.019). When controlling for covariates, the DBI effect (F(2,179) = 3.9, p = 0.021) remained significant. Conclusion: The use of anticholinergic and sedative drugs, in addition to co-morbidities and frailty, significantly affect gait dynamics (pace). A limitation of the DBI is that it does not take into account the effects of other drugs and their interactions. The DBI is a valuable tool for identifying and deprescribing potentially inappropriate medications and could be included in comprehensive geriatric assessment. Background: There is an established cross-sectional association between orthostatic hypotension (OH) and late life depression. The aim of this observational longitudinal study was to clarify the longitudinal association between baseline symptomatic OH (sOH) and incident depression in a sample of over 3000 people aged C 50 years. Methods: This study was embedded within the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, and data was analysed from Waves 1, 2 and 3. Participants with baseline depression at Wave 1 were excluded. At 2 and 4 year follow-up, a score C 9 on the 8-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to define incident depression. SOH was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) by C 20 mmHg or diastolic BP by C 10 mmHg at 30 s post standing in conjunction with orthostatic symptoms such as dizziness, using beat-to-beat BP measurements. Results: 7% (226/3174) of the study sample had sOH-30. One tenth (300/3174) had incident depression by 4-year follow-up. Participants with incident depression were almost twice as likely to have sOH at baseline compared to those without incident depression (Linear regression: 0.13 (95% CI: 0.08-0.19) vs. 0.07 (95% CI: 0.06-0.08)). Weighted logistic regression models demonstrated that sOH predicted incident depression with an odds ratio of 1.94 (95% CI: 1.18-3.19) after controlling for covariates including subthreshold depressive symptoms. Asymptomatic OH did not predict incident depression. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that sOH predicts incident depression in a population-representative sample of older people and may therefore represent a potentially modifiable risk factor for late life depression. the process. Analysis revealed six themes influencing the patient's experiences of participation: (1) The complexity of the elderly patient's state of health, (2) Management and hospital routines, (3) The norm and preferences for returning home, (4) The challenges of communication, (5) The asymmetric relationship between health personnel and the patient, (6) The significance of a care network. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that there is a gap between published health policy regarding elderly patients' participation and the professionals' opportunities to fulfil this policy in clinical work. To promote elderly patients' experience of participation in discharge processes, effective approaches that facilitate participating are needed.",

Older people are sometime perceived in a positive light but negative perceptions predominate. This can have a significant negative impact on the quality of care elderly patients receive. Continuous service review, need for change with innovative ideas is therefore essential to deliver highest standard of care to our older population. Methods: Patient feedback suggested that term 'elderly' is derogatory. To obtain wider public and patient's understanding, a survey was conducted. Patient/staff were asked about their thoughts of term 'Care of the Elderly'. List of options to choose from initially was generated by multidisciplinary team. Department of Medicine for Older People-(DMOP)Department of Older Person Care-(DOPC)Department of Care of Whole Person-(DCWP) Department of Ageing and Health-(DOAH) Senior Adult Medical Service-(SAMS) Acute Medicine for Mature Adults-(AMMA)Geriatric Medicine-(GM) Results: Total 183 respondents, 42% patients/relatives, 58% staff72% respondents suggested change. 36% of change group were patient/ relatives. 93% chose a name from available options. 7% suggested other names. 31% respondents in change group also said the term 'care of the elderly' was discriminatory, derogatory or outdated and it inferred frailty when many older people don't feel elderly. 59% change group proposed Senior Adult Medical Service-SAMS. Conclusion: Survey suggested strong reservations about the term 'Care of the Elderly' and therefore a need to change and rebrand our services to older population within National Health Services. Background: Intersectoral health tries to bridge the medical and nonmedical approaches to wellbeing. Social prescribing is a means for a health professional to refer to a link worker who can encourage or signpost a patient to sources of practical and emotional support. These supports are often community based, and provided by the voluntary sector. Examples could be dance classes, social outings, and debt or counselling services. An up-to-date, easily accessible database is vital for such signposting. Methods: We engaged school students, volunteers and work experience programmes to conduct an on-street census of every business, service and amenity in our hospital catchment area. These data were organised and made available in an online web portal of services that can be used to generate a personalised social prescription. Results: 700 kms of streets were mapped (population 198,000) . 6084 individual assets were recorded. Of these, 463 were health-related, 302 were sport and fitness related, and 323 were community supports. These assets were made available at an online portal to generate social prescriptions. The mapping exercise resulted in new links between the hospital and local schools, colleges, and community centres. Conclusion: There is a wealth of assets in the community that can be ultilised to supplement the traditional medical approach to health with a social prescription that addresses the social, emotional, or practical needs of patients.",

The control group consisted of 14 females (aged 86.5 \u00b1 6.3 years). Three types of communicative robots were assigned to the participants for eight successive weeks. Five goals for nursing care were selected for each participant prior to the allocation of a robot, and the changes were evaluated every day. Overall, the positive effects on residents' quality of life were observed [1] . We examined the correlations between age, gender and stage of dementia, and the degree of improvements. Statistical data were analyzed using software package R. The intervention group showed a greater improvement in its assigned goals than the control group. There was no difference between the genders. Concerning the stage of dementia, greater improvements were found in participants with moderate dementia (Stage IIb or more) than those with mild dementia (Stage IIa or lower). Communicative care robots have great potential for enhancing older people's capabilities, even among those with middle stage dementia. Reference: [1] Obayashi K, Kodate N, Masuyama S.

Datasets have been collected at six Pilot sites-in Athens, Birmingham, Lecce, Madrid, Montpellier and Singapore-through a mix of advanced unobtrusive technologies. An appropriate computational model [3] has been used for mapping such datasets to relevant frailtyrelated domains, used in geriatrics (such as in the Lawton IADL scale or Fried Frailty Index). Analysis of the experimental results allowed to derive preliminary insights into the effectiveness of technologybased data collection-e.g. in terms of relative accuracy, data interdependency, etc. This is important to support smart-cities' digital policies for the deployment of age friendly environments [4] . Moreover, ground truth data has been collected at the Athens and Birmingham Pilot sites, using the Functional Ability Index [5] , to label datasets with a relevant frailty status. This allowed to investigate the application of supervised machine learning algorithms for the automatic detection of early frailty onset. A preliminary proof-ofconcept demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, to support costeffective screening of the elderly population. Finally, digital communication technologies (e.g. smartphone-based messaging apps, such as WhatsApp) have been tested at the Lecce Pilot, in order to ''coach'' elderly participants and nudge them towards healthier behaviour through an appropriate mix of messages, conveying educational material (e.g. on nutrition, physical activity, etc.), information about local socializing or cultural events, or data about own performance along various domains.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a recommendation for systemic ICU admission in critically ill elderly patients reduces 6-month mortality compared with usual practice. Material: Multicenter, cluster-randomized clinical trial of critically ill patients (age C 75 years), free of cancer, with preserved functional status and nutritional status, was performed. Centers were randomly assigned either to use a program to promote systematic ICU admission of patients (n = 1519 participants) or to follow standard practice (n = 1518 participants). The primary outcome was death at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission rate, in-hospital death, functional status, and quality of life at 6 months. Results: 3036 patients were included in the trial (median age, 85 years). Patients in the systematic strategy group had an increased risk of death at 6 months (45%vs 39%; relative risk [RR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.26) despite an increased ICU admission rate (61% vs 34%; RR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.66-1.95). After adjustments, patients in the systematic strategy group were more likely to be admitted to an ICU (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.54-1.82) and had a higher risk of in-hospital death (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33) but had no significant increase in risk of death at 6 months (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.96-1.14).

Altered mental state, respiratory rate C 22/min, and systolic blood pressure B 100 mmHg give one point each, and qSOFA C 2 is associated with poor outcome. With the aim to improve cognitive assessment in the Emergency Room (ER), we used 4AT (rapid screening of alertness, cognition, attention and fluctuation of symptoms) in addition to qSOFA. 4AT C 4 indicates delirium or cognitive impairment, and a 4AT of 1-3 might indicate cognitive impairment. Methods: From October 23rd 2017 to May 14th 2018, patients aged C 65 years with suspected infections admitted to a local Norwegian hospital were screened by ER nurses with qSOFA and 4AT. Time spent on 4AT was reported. Delirium diagnoses and in-hospital mortality were retrieved from patient records. Results: 4AT-and qSOFA-scores were available for 111 patients (mean age 81, range 65-98). Median time spent on the assessment with 4AT was two Minutes (mean 2.6). Among 39 patients with a qSOFA-point given for altered mental state, 4AT revealed signs of cognitive impairment in 37 (95%). 4AT revealed signs of cognitive impairment in 26 out of 72 patients (36%) where qSOFA did not reveal altered mental state. In total, 29 patients (26%) had delirium during the hospital stay. The overall in-hospital mortality was 4.5%.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of day-to-day BPV with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cerebral atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, data from 93 memory clinic patients were analyzed. BP was measured twice in the morning and evening for 1 week. BPV was expressed as coefficient of variation (COV). WMH were assessed with the Fazekas scale (0-3). Additionally, the global cortical atrophy (GCA) and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) were scored. ANCOVA was conducted to investigate BPV in different groups of Fazekas, GCA or MTA, corrected for age and mean BP. As a second step, smoking status, diabetes, use of antihypertensives, medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were added in the analysis. Results: Higher Fazekas score was significantly related to BPV (COV of systolic BP), controlling for age, F(3,77) = 3.176, p = 0.029. Controlling for mean systolic BP reduced the statistical significance of this association, F(3,76) = 2.640, p = 0.056. Planned contrasts showed higher COV of systolic BP for Fazekas 1, 2 or 3 compared to Fazekas 0 (p = 0.047, 0.010 and 0.019, respectively). Secondary analysis showed that smoking status and hypercholesterolemia significantly influenced the correlation between COV and Fazekas (p = 0.040 and 0.036, respectively). No significant associations were present for GCA and MTA with BPV. Conclusion: These results suggest an association between BPV and WMH, but not with other markers of neurodegeneration. More research is recommended to further explore this association.",

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS Cog) after a 6-month period in both groups and after 6 months of secondary HA activation in the placebo group. A smaller cognitive decline should be obtained with HA use; an increase in ADAS Cog score of less than 6 points was defined a success. Results: Fifty-one patients aged 68 to 99 years were included; 38 attended the 6-month visit: 18 in the active group and 20 in the placebo group. At 6 months, 14 (82.4%) successes were noticed in the active group, and 15 (88.2%) in the placebo group (p = 1.0); delta ADAS Cog in the active group was 1.8 \u00b1 5.3 and 1.3 \u00b1 5.3 in the placebo group (p = 0.8).

Aim: The aim of this research is to evaluate the multi-level impact and progress-to-date of the NDSIP. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used. Perspectives of stakeholders on executive, strategic, and operational levels were explored through semi-structured focus groups, interviews, and online surveys. Stakeholders included people living with dementia, caregivers of people living with dementia, health and social care providers, not-for-profit organisations, representatives of government departments, and other stakeholders who were involved in the development, monitoring and implementation of both the NDS and NDSIP.",

We examined rates of VD obtained using the well-established NINDS-AIREN criteria versus the recently developed VASCOG criteria in a population-based study of TIA/stroke. Methods: In a longitudinal study of all TIA/stroke occurring within a defined population of 92,728 (Oxford Vascular Study/2002 -2012 baseline clinical assessment and CT/MR brain imaging were performed with follow-up to 5 years. Multiple overlapping methods including face-to-face interview were used to ascertain dementia. VASCOG and NINDS-AIREN criteria were applied in patients with dementia and agreement assessed with kappa statistic. Results: Among 2305 TIA/stroke patients (mean/SD age 73.7/13.0), 432 (18.7%) had dementia during follow-up. Using VASCOG criteria, 194 (44.9%) patients fulfilled criteria for probable VD versus 90 (20.8%) using NINDS-AIREN criteria. Rates of possible VD varied even more widely at 21 (4.9%) by VASCOG criteria vs 293 (67.8%) by NINDS-AIREN. Many patients did not fulfil criteria because of failure to meet imaging requirements (n = 123/51.6%-VASCOG and n = 175/54.3%-NINDS-AIREN), followed by no history/signs of stroke (n = 84/35.3%-VASCOG) or lack of a temporal relationship between cerebrovascular disease and dementia (n = 274/85.1%-NINDS-AIREN). Agreement between NINDS-AIREN and VASCOG for the diagnosis of probable/possible VD was low at 36.6% (kappa 0.22, p \\ 0.001), but increased to 75.0% for the diagnosis of probable VD (kappa 0.47, p \\ 0.001).",

Evidence from mendelian randomization Kirsty Bowman 1 , David Melzer 2 1 University of Exeter Medical School, 2 University of Exeter Medical School UK, University of Connecticut Health Center USA Introduction: Delirium is associated with increased mortality risks, admittance to nursing homes and high health care costs. Many delirium episodes may be preventable. There has been increased interest in the role of vitamin D in cognitive impairment. A recent analysis showed that genetically determined higher levels of vitamin D were associated with reduced risks for Alzheimer's disease. Evidence is limited for the role of vitamin D with delirium using large community-based studies. Methods: We used 313,121 European participants from the UK Biobank, a healthy volunteer cohort, who were aged 60 years by the end of the follow-up. We used a Mendelian randomization approach to minimize confounding and reverse causation. We tested the associations between individual vitamin D altering variants and a vitamin D genetic risk score with incident hospital delirium episodes during B 9.9 years of follow-up.",

Practical implications Introduction: Prevalence of peripheral arterial disease increases with age and is related to increased morbidity and mortality, especially in older adults. The clinical diagnosis includes the measurement of ankle-brachial index (ABI). We aimed to check the prevalence of abnormal ABI, and the value of physical examination of arterial system in detection of ABI \\ 0.9. Methods: We performed subgroup analysis of patients included in the PolSenior survey in whom we measured ABI, performed detailed physical examination of arterial system, and assessed laboratory and questionnaire factors related to atherosclerosis. Patients were divided according to ABI strata of \\ 0.9, 0.9-1.4 and [ 1.4 and summary clinical score of abnormalities on physical examination was proposed. Using logistic regression we obtained areas under the curve (AUC). Results: The mean (SD) age of 860 participants (53.5% men) was 74.7 (10.6) years. ABI \\ 0.9 was found in 19.9% participants and it was linked to higher overall cardiovascular risk. In the \\ 0.9 ABI group 62.7% group vs. 73.9% in normal ABI group, and 75.7% in ABI [ 1.4 (p = 0 .02) could walk more than 200 meters. Higher clinical score was associated with lower ABI. Full physical examination (AUC = 0.67) followed by examination of lower extremities (AUC = 0.65) showed strongest diagnostic value for presence of ABI based PAD (nie rozumiem!). Neither ABI nor clinical examination were good predictors of inability to walk over 200 meters.",

MRH and associated healthcare use within 8-weeks post-discharge were identified by senior pharmacists using 1 hospital readmission data, 2 primary care records, 3 patient telephone interviews. Based on the Rockwood approach [3] , we developed a frailty index including 55 deficits from multiple domains (morbidity, cognition, mood, strength and mobility, nutrition, daily function). Frailty was defined using the established cut-off of 20% deficits [4] , and internally validated using Kaplan-Meier plots comparing survival in frail and nonfrail patients. We then used logistic regression analysis to investigate the relationship between frailty and MRH requiring healthcare. Area: Biogerontology and genetics O-104 Acute cytokine production upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide associates with cardiovascular mortality risk independent of circulating markers of chronic inflammation Background: The risk of a cardiovascular event is transiently increased after infection, which suggests a role for the immune response in its pathogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate whether acute cytokine production upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide associates with cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and whether this association is dependent on chronic inflammation. Methods: In 403 subjects from the PROspecitve Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial, with a mean age of 75.1 years, we determined acute cytokine production at baseline by ex vivo stimulating whole-blood samples with lipopolysaccharide and measuring the production of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, IL-12, IL-1b, IL-10, and IL-1RA production within 24 h. A composite acute cytokine production score was calculated by averaging the individual acute cytokines production values after sexspecific standardisation. Serum IL-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured as circulating markers of chronic inflammation. Subjects were followed for 12.8 years and cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was recorded.",

Exploring underlying genetic predispositions might help to risk-stratify patients for early intervention. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) protein regulates antioxidant and de-toxifying effectors in the cell. Nrf2 expression declines with age, potentially increasing vulnerability to multimorbidity and ADR. We hypothesise that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 3 loci in the Nrf2 gene are associated with multimorbidity and ADR in older adults. Methods: One-hundred and twenty-seven patients were recruited from a sub-population of the PRIME study (a multicentre prospective cohort study that followed older adults over 8-weeks post-discharge to determine ADR status). Donated genetic material was sequenced to determine genotype at 3 loci: rs6721961, rs35652124 and rs6706649 and then analysed for association with ADR (Naranjo Algorithm) and multimorbidity ([ 2 conditions defined by the Charlson Index (CI)). Results: One-hundred and twelve patients (mean age 76.6 \u00b1 7.3 years, 55.4% female) were successfully genotyped.

Patients aged 70 years or older, with cancer were included. Biomarkers collected were plasmatic C-reactive protein, albumin and a combined score: Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS). The GPS comprised three categories (0: CRP B 10 mg/L, albumin C 35 g/L; 1: CRP B 10 mg/L and albumin \\ 35 g/L, or CRP [ 10 mg/L and albumin C 35 g/L; 2: CRP [ 10 mg/L and albumin \\ 35 g/L). The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 months. Multivariable Cox models were used, adjusting for age, sex, localisation, metastatic status, performance status, frailty screening index, the G8. Discriminative properties were assessed using Harrell C index and NRI (Net Reclassificatio Improvement). Results: Overall 1800 patients were analysed (ELCAPA: N = 543, PHRC Aquitaine: N = 253, ONCODAGE: N = 1004; mean age: 78.5 \u00b1 5.5 years; 61.7% of men; 28.9% metastatic; most frequent localisations: breast (34.9%) and colon-rectum (17.7%); 70.7% of patients screened at risk of frailty with G8). Overall survival was 71.1%. GPS was independently associated with death (among normal G8: GPS 1: Hazard Ratio (HR) = 4.48; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) = [2.03; 9 .89], GPS 2: 11.64 [4.54; 29 .81], among anormal G8: GPS 1: 2.45 [1.79; 3.34 ], GPS 2: 3.97 [2.93; 5.37 ]. The addition of GPS to the clinical model (Harell C: 0.82 [0.80; 0.83] ) improved discrimination (Harell C: 0.84 [0.82; 0.85] , NRI: 11% [5; 19] ). Conclusion: GPS could be used in older patients with cancer to help decision-making and prognosis assesment.",

Toothache while chewing was the oral problem with the lowest (B:5.2%, FW:6.6%) and xerostomia with the highest prevalence at both time points (B:24.3%, FW:30%). In the long term better self-rated oral health was positively (b = 0.650, SE = 0.298, p = 0.029) and being edentulous (b = -1.739, SE = 0.753, p = 0.021) as well as wearing complete dentures (b = -1.591, SE = 0.779 p = 0.041) were negatively associated with BW. No further oral health variables showed an association with BW. Key conclusions: In community-dwelling older adults poorer selfrated oral health, being edentulous and wearing complete dentures may contribute to weight loss in the long term. Background: Evidence on the risk of hip fracture (HF) associated with individual antidepressants (ADs) is scarce, because most studies addressed only AD classes. However, risk profiles can vary widely between individual agents. We assessed the risk of HF associated with individual ADs in older adults. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of new users of ADs aged C 65 years, based on the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD) during 2005-2014. Incident cases of hospitalization for HF were identified and matched to up to 100 controls per case using incidence density sampling. Use of AD was ascertained at index date (ID; cases: date of HF; controls: matched date) based on the duration of the last dispensation. Current use was defined as use overlapping ID. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs), with 95% confidence interval (CI), using conditional logistic regression with remote users of any AD as reference category, adjusting for co-morbidities and co-medications. Results: Among 706,561 cohort members, 39,853 cases were identified and matched to 3,979,510 controls (in both groups: 79.8% women; median age 81 years). Current users had aOR (95% CI) of 1.51 (1.47-1.56 ) for citalopram, 1.51 (1.38-1.65 ) for duloxetine, 1.48 (1.34-1.63 ) for escitalopram, 1.47 (1.35-1.61 ) for venlafaxine, 1.46 (1.39-1.53 ) for amitriptyline, 1.45 (1.35-1.55 ) for sertraline and 1.45 (1.27-1.66 ) for fluoxetine. The aOR was lower for paroxetine (1.36; 1.20-1.55) , trimipramine (1.14; 1.04-1.26) and mirtazapine (1.13; 1.08-1.17) . Conclusions: In this large cohort, mirtazapine and trimipramine had a lower risk than most examined individual SSRI, SSNRI and amitriptyline.",

The main barrier to de-prescribing was the family doctor's unwillingness to adopt PDP recommendations (p \\ 0.0001). The average number of medications at baseline in the NR and PDP, was 10.49 vs.10.20 (NS), and in the last follow-up 10.67 vs. 3.84, respectively (p = 0.0001). PDPs showed significantly less deterioration in functional, mental and cognitive status, sleep quality, appetite, sphincter control, and less major complications (p \\ 0.002 in all). The rate of hospitalizations and mortality was comparable. Health improvement occurred within 3 months after PDP in 83% and persisted for C 2 years in 68%. Conclusion: This longitudinal research proves that in older people poly-de-prescribing is both safe and beneficial, being associated with significantly better quality of life, as compared to clinical outcomes of those who adhere to conventional recommendations and take all medications based on all specialists' clinical guidelines.

We compared the accumulation of hospital days between AED initiators and non-initiators among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as between individual AEDs. Methods: We conducted an exposure-matched cohort study among persons diagnosed with AD in 2005-2011 (n = 70,718) as identified from Finnish health care registers. For each AED initiator, one noninitiator matched on age, sex and time since AD diagnosis was selected. Accumulation of hospital days was measured during a twoyear follow-up. Association between AED initiation or use of individual AEDs and accumulation of hospital days was assessed using negative binomial model. Results: AED initiators (n = 4878) were hospitalized on average for 42.3 (SD: 87.9) days and matched non-initiators 28.0 (SD: 66.0) days during the two-year follow-up. Zero hospital days were observed for 31.4% of the AED initiators and for 41.4% of the non-initiators. Number of accumulated hospital days during the follow-up was 52% higher (adjusted incidence rate ratio, aIRR: 1.52, 95%, CI: 1.38-1.67) among AED initiators than the non-initiators. Among pregabalin (aIRR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.52-0.72), gabapentin (aIRR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.44-0.80) and clonazepam (aIRR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.96) initiators the number of accumulated hospital days was 28-41% lower than among initiators of valproic acid. Key conclusions: AED initiators are at increased risk of higher number of hospital days than non-initiators. Pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with lower number of hospital admissions than valproic acid.",

Leveraging the Danish nationwide health registries, we aimed to characterize the drug use among Danish people C 60 years. Methods: A descriptive study assessing the drug use in 2015 in the Danish population age C 60 years. Drug use at specific therapeutic subgroups and chemical subgroups and its dependence on age were described using descriptive statistics. The patterns of combination of drugs were analysed by using latent class analysis. Results: We included 1,424,775 persons (median age 70 years, interquartile range (IQR) 65-77; 53% women). The median number of drugs groups was five per person (IQR, (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . The most used single drug groups were paracetamol (5.9%), statins (5.7%), and platelet aggregation inhibitors (4.1%). The most used drug groups were cardiovascular drugs (18%), nervous system drugs (14%) and alimentary tract and metabolism (11%). The distribution of the therapeutic groups was in large consistent with age. Eighteen classes with different drug combination patterns were identified. One class without any drugs (21% of the population), and 11 classes with an expected number of drugs over five were identified. Conclusions: The use of drugs is extensive both at the population level and increasing with age at an individual level. Cardiovascular, analgesics, and psychotropic drugs were the most prevalent drug classes. Eighteen different drug patterns were identified. The drug patterns have the potential to be used in further studies about risk prescriptions.",

Secondary endpoints include symptoms and proxies' satisfaction. Methods: We recruited 340/625 residents in five nursing homes in Helsinki. At baseline, all participants were assessed for HRQOL (15D), symptoms (ESAS, PAINAD), hospital use, advance care plans and proxies' satisfaction of care. The staff in intervention wards was given four 4-hour education sessions discussing the principles of palliative care (introduction, advance care planning, adverse effects of hospitalizations, symptom management, communication, supporting proxies, challenging situations) using constructive learning methods with staffs' own patient cases.",

Poor care outcomes have been often reported especially for residents with dementia. Our aims were twofold: first to assess whether the diagnosis of dementia was associated with specific patterns of end-of-life care during the last 6 months of life, and second to compare care pattern of residents with dementia according to living status at 6 month. Methods: Secondary, cross-sectional analysis and prospective study IQUARE. 175 nursing homes in south-west France. Residents at baseline, stratified according vital status at 6-month follow-up and dementia diagnosis. Results: Among the 6275 residents enrolled in IQUARE study, 494 (7.9%) were dead at 6-months of follow-up; among them, 240 (48.6%) had a diagnosis of dementia. Among all residents with dementia (n = 2688), 240 (8.9%) were dead at 6-months of follow-up. Among residents who died during the first 6 months, compared to residents without dementia, residents with dementia were more disabled and malnourished. They are more likely to be exposed to physical restraints (OR = 1.65, 95% IC = 1.08-2.51), with a prevalence of 55.4%; and less likely to have anxiolytic prescription (OR = 0.58, 95%IC = 0.38-0.88). Among residents with dementia, residents dying within a delay of 6 months are more likely to be identified with ''end-of-life'' status (OR = 5.71, 95% IC = 3.48-9.37), but with only 15% of identification. They are more likely to experience pain (OR = 1.43, 95% IC = 1.04-1.97) and to be physically restrained (OR = 1.46, 95% IC = 1.08-1.98).

Unfortunately, their application is rare-in consequence, pain is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated in these subjects. The aim of the study was to assess analgesic treatment in nursing home residents (NHR) with cognitive impairment and to delineate the relationship between pain and behavioral disturbances. Method: The research was conducted in two nursing homes in Wielkopolska, Poland. The analyzed group consisted of 96 residents (78 female) with moderate and severe cognitive impairment in whom pain was assessed with the Abbey Pain Scale (APS) and agitation with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). Medical files related to drug prescriptions were analyzed. Results: Analgesics were consumed by 33 individuals (34%); 24 (25%) received regular pain treatment, 7-as needed only (PRN) and 2 (2%)-both regular and PRN. In regards to non-opioid analgesia 13 persons (14%) received them regularly. No one received monotherapy with analgesics from the second step of the analgesic ladder, 2 (2%)received a strong opioid Relationship was found between the APS and CMAI (r = 0.45, p \\ 0.0001). Subjects with a higher CMAI received sedative drugs more frequently (p \\ 0.001) and despite having a higher APS (p = 0.001), this did not correlate with higher analgesia. Conclusion: Our study suggests that pain can be an important underlying cause of behavioral disturbances in older subjects with dementia. To reduce their frequency and to avoid excessive usage of sedatives, proper pain assessment and management is essential.",

Normal controls were recruited through spouses of participants, or volunteers from the community. Participants underwent physical examination, medical history, cognitive testing with a standardized battery, biobanking, genetics, spinal tap, MRI and FDG-PET. Participants were classified as either SCD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) according to cognitive screening. MCI was determined if score was B 1.5 SD below the normative mean on either CERAD delayed recall, Trailmaking B, COWAT, VOSP silhouettes, or MMSE B 27. Results: 721 participants were included. The MCI group was older (mean 65.1 vs mean 60.9 yr). The SCD group had lower Body Mass Index. In the MCI group, there were significantly elevated levels of CRP and pro-BNP, and also diabetes and coronary heart disease. There were more smokers in the MCI group. BMI of B 25 was associated with higher levels of CSF total/phospho-tau. Total cholesterol of 7.0 or more was associated with pathological levels of CSF Abeta42-amyloid, P-and T-tau. Conclusion: The association between elevated levels of CRP and pro-BNP and a higher total cholesterol in the MCI group could be interpreted as presence of inflammatory response in these individuals who are at risk for developing AD. Introduction: Many factors influence cognitive function. We evaluated influence of some socioeconomic factors upon cognitive disorders in elderly. Materials and methods: 975 consecutively admitted older patients were investigated. Gender distribution: 67% women, 33% men; age range 65-97, mean 81 years. Sample was divided into three age groups: young-old (65-74 years), old-old (75-84 years), very-old (85-97 years). Parameters considered: gender, age, level of education, place of residence (urban/rural), income, marital status, comorbidity, cognitive function at admission. Tests used for screening cognitive disorders: Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test and Five Words Test. Results: Two neurocognitive disorders were evaluated: mild neurocognitive disorders (former mild cognitive impairment -MCI) and moderate to severe neurocognitive disorder (dementia). Higher risk of MCI in men than women: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.47. Adjusting for age and education OR was higher 1.67, adjusting for marital status OR was 1.71 in favor of men. Adjusting for disease burden we obtained 1.54 in favor of men. Higher risk of dementia for women, OR 1.61. Adjusting for age and education Odds Ratio increased to 2.2 in favor of women; adjusting for marital status value decreased to 1.3. Adjusting for comorbidity, risk of developing dementia in women as compared to men was 1.9. Odds of having dementia was higher in rural as compared to urban patients 1.3. Conclusions: Risk of MCI was higher in men, with low education and without spouse. Risk of dementia was higher in women, with lower education and higher comorbidity and from rural area.",

After adjusting for patient, nursing unit, and other nurse staffing characteristics, we found that each 3-additional work-shifts where the nurse-to-patient ratios on medical-surgical wards were less than 1:5 was associated with an increased risk of death of 1.5% (HR: 1.015, 95% CI 1.008-1.022). We also noted that very few work-shifts in the ICU were below the minimum ratio set in California (i.e., 1:2) , and found that the cumulative number of shifts where the ICU nurse-to-patient ratios were below this threshold was not significantly associated with the risk of death. Discussion: Failure to meet the minimum nurse-to-patient ratio set in California for medical and surgical units increases the risk of death among patients admitted to these units. There is a pressing need for policies that will attract and retain greater number of nurses in hospitals to satisfy minimum staffing ratios.",

Introduction: Arrhythmias induced by a change in ventricular wall stress might be important in clinical situations, for example, arterial blood pressure is more labile in hypertensive patients. Whether artemisinin (ART) can prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by pressure overload and induce atrioventricular block (AVB) compared with verapamil (VER) in SH rats was never studied. Methods: Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery increased the left ventricular pressure, left ventricular wall stress, and, eventually, caused ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The SH rats that underwent TAC surgery comprised the ST group. The ventricular arrhythmia scores (VASs) and the rates of the different types of AVB were determined in the absence and presence of ART and VER.",

AVBs were only detected in the groups that had undergone TAC and had been pretreated with ART and VER.

Bosone 3 1 Clinical studies on the efficacy and safety of drugs often do not include older people. Hence, there is a lack of evidence as to the appropriateness of numerous drug treatments in the elderly. Undoubtedly, these circumstances often turn the drug therapy of older people into a risky experiment. To address this issue, the FORTA classification (A: Absolutely; B: Beneficial; C: Careful; D: Don't) was proposed as a clinical aid for physicians. The FORTA List was validated and expanded in a Delphi consensus procedure. To evaluate the effectiveness of FORTA we conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial in hospitalized elderly patients. Nearly half of our patients received standard care and the other half received standard care plus the FORTA method. In this study, we separately tested changes of drug prescriptions at the anatomical-therapeutic-chemical system (ATC) level for important diagnoses and compared over-and undertreatment rates between the groups. At the individual drug/drug group level, two items (e.g. loop diuretics) were significantly altered by FORTA when overall use changes between admission and discharge were compared between groups. In addition, FORTA also significantly improved undertreatment (e.g. beta receptor blocking agents or phenprocoumon to treat atrial fibrillation) or overtreatment (e.g. loop diuretics to treat arterial hypertension) for nineteen drugs/drug groups. Based on this study, FORTA is the first combined positive/negative labelling approach at the individual drug level which is effective in eliminating inappropriate prescribing and certainly ameliorates the drug treatment of older people.",

To tackle with polypharmacy in an acute care hospital, we started a clinical medication review team to optimize the medications and investigated the effect of the intervention on older patients with polypharmacy. Methods: We organized ''Geriatric Pharmacotherapy Optimization Team'' consisting of doctors, pharmacists, nurses, dieticians and rehabilitation therapists. Our team routinely reviewed the medication regimen and adherence based on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and medication review followed by a multidisciplinary team conference. From September 2016 to December 2017, we reviewed 58 cases, which were divided into two groups; three or more medication reduction group (C 3R) and less than three reduction group (\\ 3R). The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) within 60 days was analyzed using the Chi square test. Results: In the C 3R group (n = 32), the average age was 79.6 (7.2(SD)) years old, and the average number of medications was 11.6 (3.4) at admission and 6.7 (3.5) at discharge. In the \\ 3R group (n = 26), the average age was 78.9 (6.4) years old, the average number of medications was 9.9 (1.9) at hospitalization and 9.5 (3.0) at discharge.

Evidence on the comparative safety of individual AD in this regard is scarce. We assessed the risk of TBI associated with ADs in older adults. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of new users of ADs aged C 65 years, based on the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD) during 2005-2014. Incident cases of hospitalization for TBI were identified and matched to up to 100 controls per case using incidence density sampling. Use of AD was ascertained at index date (ID; cases: date of TBI; controls: matched date) based on the duration of the last dispensation. Current use was defined as duration overlapping ID. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs), with 95% confidence interval (CI), using conditional logistic regression with current users of mirtazapine as reference category, adjusting for co-morbidities and co-medications. Background: Previous register studies have shown poor compliance after discharge with changes made to the patients' medicine during admission. Follow up interview with the GPs found a wish for contact between the hospital doctor and the GP for discussion of eventual changes. The aim of the study was to enlighten the feasibility of a study of discussion of the patient's medicine between the hospital doctor and the GP on discharge proceeded by a comprehensive clinical pharmacist-led medication review. Method: Patients admitted to the Department of Geriatric Medicine, Odense University Hospital, Denmark during spring 2018 were screened by a clinical pharmacist. Main exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment or patients isolated due to infection or less than 5 drugs (inclusion criteria). Following the medication review suggestions for drug changes were given to the doctor. Within the first days after discharge the pharmacist contacted the GP for setting up a telephone-contact for discussion of the drug treatment.",

Traditionally, anticoagulation was underused in geriatric patients with AF. Methods: Hospitalized geriatric patients treated in 2015 were retrospectively studied for the presence of AF and the use or non-use of anticoagulation. The risk of stroke and the indication for permanent anticoagulation were assessed using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Results: 512 of 1320 patients showed a clear indication for therapeutic anticoagulation (38.8%). Of these, 431 patients (84.2%) had long-standing persistent ([ 1 year)/permanent AF or paroxysmal/ persistent ([ 7 days) AF as well as a CHA2DS2-VASc score of C 2 in men and C 3 in women. In this group, 378 patients (87.7%) received anticoagulation. Of all patients anticoagulated for AF, 221 received NOACs (58.5%), 176 received apixaban (46.6%), 32 rivaroxaban (8.5%), and 13 dabigatran (3.4%) . 107 patients received the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon (28.3%) and 50 patients high-dose low-molecular weight heparins (13.2%). In 26 patients (5.7% of all anticoagulated patients, n = 459) complications were documented. 13 complications (50.0% of those treated) occurred during treatment with NOACs, 5 (19.2%) during anticoagulation with phenprocoumon and 8 (30.8%) during treatment with low molecular weight heparins. No intracranial hemorrhages occurred, and 9 patients required transfusion or surgery to stop bleeding. Conclusion: The introduction of NOACs and an increased awareness of their benefits led to an increased use of anticoagulation from 52.8% (2011) to 87. 7% (2015) in geriatric patients with AF at our institution. researches, where PIM and polypharmacy assessed, increased.

Methods: Malnutrition risk was determined using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) and high anticholinergic burden (level C 3) was defined using the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS). Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the contribution of high anticholinergic burden and associated potential confounding factors on the nutritional status of participants. Results: The average anticholinergic burden was 1.39 \u00b1 1.46. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, there was no significant association between high anticholinergic burden and risk of malnutrition (OR = 1.03, 95% CI [0.52-2.03], p = 0.925). However, the risk of malnutrition was significantly higher for women, patients with a high Charlson Comorbidity Index score, history of fracture or falls, a low score on the MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination), AGGIR (Autonomie G\u00e9rontologique Groupe Iso-Ressources) and QOL-AD (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease) assessments.",

The record was checked for information regarding doctors InTec assessment. Results: A total of 39 patients (64% women) were included. Patients were old (80.6 (5.5) years (mean(SD)), had moderately reduced ADL (median[IQR])) and cognitive function ), and high comorbidity (CCI 3 [2] [3] [4] [5] ). Of these, 18(46%) had sufficient IC. In patients bringing own device (n = 29) 7(24%) used this correctly and 6 (20%) had sufficient IC. Doctors had tested 3/33(9%). Patients with sufficient IC were younger (78.7 (4.8) vs 82.3 (5.6) years, p = 0.038) and more likely to be men (71.4% vs 32.0%, p = 0.018). No significant differences were found between patients when addressing InTec in terms of IC, Barthelindex, OMC-score, or CCI. Patients with correct InTec were significantly younger (76.7 (3.9) vs 82.6 (5.6) years, p = 0.017), which stayed borderline significant when adjusting for sex, Barthel-Index, OMC-score, and CCI (p = 0.086). Numerous trials have shown that older people are often subjects to inappropriate and unsafe drug treatment. The main reason for this problem is that for most of the medications there is no evidence regarding efficacy and safety in older patients. This problem is worsened by the high prevalence of multimorbidity and therefore polymedication in this group. To raise the appropriateness of drug therapy in the aged, we have developed a clinical aid called the FORTA List. FORTA was originally invented by Wehling and validated and expanded by twenty experts in a Delphi consensus procedure in Germany/Austria. Subsequently, we evaluated FORTA's usefulness in a pilot clinical trial as well as in a controlled prospective trial. These trials revealed that FORTA significantly improves the quality of pharmacotherapy and reduces the frequency of adverse drug reactions. Based on these results, Delphi consensus validations of country/region-specific FORTA Lists were conducted in seven European countries/regions. 47 experts in total agreed to participate in our study. For each country/region, the overall mean consensus coefficient was higher than 0.9. FORTA Lists from six countries/ regions plus the German FORTA List were collated into the EURO-FORTA List including 264 items in 26 main indication groups. For only 4.2% of the proposed items the consensus results were different from the original/proposed FORTA class. This study produced seven new country/region-specific FORTA Lists as well as the EURO-FORTA List. The results of this project are going to increase the applicability of the FORTA List for international use.",

Adherence is important for antidepressants to be effective. We aimed to determine the non-adherence rates to antidepressants among older adults in primary care, based on non-initiation, suboptimal implementation or nonpersistence. Methods: We selected all patients aged C 60 years and diagnosed with depression in 2012, from the NIVEL Primary Care Database. Non-adherence was divided into three components: non-initiation was defined as no dispensing within 14 days of the first prescription; suboptimal implementation, as fewer than 80% of the days covered by dispensed dosages; and non-persistence, as discontinuation within 294 days after first dispense. First, we determined the antidepressant non-initiation, suboptimal implementation and non-persistence rates. Second, we examined whether comorbidity and chronic drug use were associated with non-adherence by mixed-effects logistic regression (non-initiation or suboptimal implementation as dependent variables) and a clustered Cox regression (time to non-persistence). Results: Non-initiation, suboptimal implementation, and non-persistence rates were 13.5, 15.2 and 37.1%, respectively. As the number of chronically used drugs increased, the odds of suboptimal implementation (odds ratio 0.89; 95% CI 0.83-0.95) and of non-persistence (hazard ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.82-0.92) reduced. Key conclusions: Non-adherence to antidepressants was quite common. Adherence is better when patients are accustomed to taking larger numbers of drugs, but this only provides partial explanation of the variance. General practitioners should be aware of the high rates of nonadherence. Elaborating on the efficacy and optimal length of antidepressant therapy might be prudent first steps to improve adherence.",

Experience of a center Rivaroxaban is gaining currency in clinical practice to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Elderly are under-represented in the trials that proved efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban, with 18% of patients over 80-years-old. Our goal was to report use of rivaroxaban in real geriatric clinical practice describing the pattern of prescription in a teaching-hospital. From January 2017 to April 2018, 53 patients, with a median age of 85, treated with rivaroxaban for NVAF were included. Demographic, biologic, therapeutic data with doses, coprescription and comorbidities were collected from the hospital's electronic records. They were then compared to ROCKET patient's profile. Patients were at low embolic risk compared to ROCKET study patients (mean CHADS2 2.72 \u00b1 1.18 vs 3.5 \u00b1 0.9; p \\ 0.0001). They had lower rates of coexisting illnesses, regarding stroke histories (18.9% vs 54.9%, p \\ 0.0001), diabetes (22.6% vs 40%, p = 0.013) and heart failure (37.7% vs 62.6%, p = 0.0003) anyway more ischemic cardiopathies (30.2% vs 16.6%, p = 0.014), and renal impairment (Cockcroft creatinine clearance 48 vs 67 mL/min, p \\ 0.0001) were reported. Fourteen patients (26.4%) received an inappropriate dose despite guidelines that suggest adjusting prescription to renal function; 9 of them (64%) received a reduced dose instead of a standard dose. No predictive factors of underdosing were underlined. Inappropriate dose prescription of rivaroxaban is frequent in elderly patients treated for NVAF. Direct oral anticoagulants need to be prescribed with doses tailored to renal function if we want to reach efficacy and safety previously described in large clinical trials and registries.",

Methods: Drug prescriptions of older adults aged 65 years or older in a Japanese city (approximately 230,000 of population and 65 years or older was 34%) were investigated using health care claims data. Age group, sex, number of medical facilities used, and 8 most frequent diseases were assessed and whether these factors were associated with polypharmacy ([ 5 drugs) or not was analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results: Total of 50,983 older adults (C 65 years) were analyzable and polypharmacy was seen in 35.3%. Polypharmacy was most frequent in the age group of 85-89 years (51.6%) and the number of medical facilities used was 1: 55.2%, 2: 30.7%, 3: 10.4%, and 4 or more: 3.7%. The prevalence of 8 major diseases was hypertension: 59.9%, dyslipidemia: 43.0%, peptic ulcer diseases: 41.5%, diabetes: 29.3%, neuralgia: 22.5%, arthritis 21.0%, osteoporosis: 18.9%, and coronary disease: 18.4%. In multiple regression analysis, older age, multiple use of medical facilities, and each disease were independently associated with polypharmacy. Key conclusion: In a city of super-aged society, the prevalence of polypharmacy was high and increased with age, multiple use of medical facilities, and diseases. Surprisingly, polypharmacy was most seen in the age group of 85-89, which is similar to the mean life expectancy of Japan.",

The aim of this study is to describe the clinical aspects of overdose in VKA administration and determine its hemorrhagic factors in elderly. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out with elderly patients treated with VKA. All patients with an INR greater than 4 were included. We studied patients gender and age, VKA use period, other associated drugs, indications, INR value, presence of hemorrhage and immediate management. Results: There were 31 patients complicated with 35 events of VKA overdose. Acenocoumarol was the only prescribed VKA. Sex ratio favored women (0.82). The average age of patients was 73.7 years. Forty one percent were smokers (n = 13). Multi-morbidity was seen in 19.35% of patients (n = 6). Indications were deep vein thrombosis in 83.87% (n = 26), superficial thrombophlebitis in one patient, pulmonary embolism in 19.35% (n = 6), portal vein thrombosis in on patient, inferior vena cava thrombosis in one patient. High level of homocysteine was found in 25.8% (n = 8), tumors in 2 patients, Beh\u00e7et's disease in one patient, antiphospholipid syndrome in two patient, activated protein C resistance in one patient and indeterminate causes in 54.83% (n = 17). Most of events happened in the first 6 months of use: 40% (n = 14). Medium value of INR was 8.16 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Overdose was complicated with hemorrhagic signs in 48.57% of events (n = 17). Hemorrhagic symptoms were mainly represented by hematuria (n = 8) and bruising (n = 5). Major bleeding episodes were found in 25.71% of events (n = 9) and they were represented by melena in 4 events (11.42%) and deep muscle hematoma in 5 events (14.28%). Miss use was observed in 31.42% (n = 11), indeterminate causes in 40% (n = 14), Drug interaction in 4 events (antibiotics, fibrate, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Kidney failure was found in 19.35% of patients (n = 6). VKA assumption was suspended transiently in all patients and vitamin K was prescribed in 34.28% of events (n = 12). Conclusion: VKA can cause serious side effects. The reduction in VKA overdose requires caregivers to manage overdose factors and provide proper patient education.",

Methods: A prospective three-year (2015-2017) observational study was conducted to analyze the impact of co-morbidities and different regimes of drug therapy in the prehospital stage for the frequency of repeated hospitalizations in patients 65 years old and older regardless of sex. Results: One hundred and forty seven patients (36.7%) from 401, included in the study had the repeated hospitalizations. The highest frequency (69 cases) of repeated hospitalizations was seen in participants of 75-84 years old. Anemia (OR 16.68, , p = 0.00793), bronchial asthma (OR 7.55, 95% CI 1.77-32.2, p = 0, 0063), diabetes mellitus (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.24-0.69, p = 0.00091), arthropathy (arthritis, arthrosis) (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1, 37-4.55, p = 0.00294) and pain (OR 4.48, p = 0.0005) were associated with a higher risk of repeated hospitalizations. Prehospital pharmacotherapy analysis revealed that the use of acetylsalicylic acid (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.29-2.84, p = 0.00115); losartan (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.17-3.17, p = 0.00952); enalapril (OR 1.97, p = 0.01) were also associated with the increased risk of re-hospitalization. Polypharmacy (defined as simultaneous administration of 5 or more drugs) was observed in 86 (58.5%) re-hospitalized patients and most often in persons 85 years old and older.

            "text": "Association between socioeconomic status and medication-related harm in elderly patients: a multicentre prospective cohort study in England [1] . Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use [2] . Our study investigated the relationship between SES and MRH in older adults. Methods: Methods for this study are published [3] . Patients aged 65 + years were recruited at hospital discharge from 5 teaching hospitals in England between 2013 and 2015. Patients were followed up for 8-weeks by senior pharmacists to identify MRH using 3 data sources: hospital readmissions, GP records and patient interviews. Based on residential postcodes, Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles [4] were used as a standard proxy measure for patient SES (1 least deprived, 5 most deprived). Logistic regression models, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, number of medicines, Charlson index, Barthel index), were used to examine the association between SES and MRH. Results: 1116 patients (median age 82; 58% female) were included. 413 patients experienced MRH, of which 301 (73%) experienced MRH from adverse drug reactions, 45 (11%) from non-adherence, and 67 (16%) from combinations of these and medication errors. In the univariate analysis, lower SES was significantly associated with MRH due to non-adherence (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08-1.49, p = 0.004). Multivariable logistic regression, controlling for confounders, found this relationship to remain significant (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.07-1.82, p = 0.015). There was no association between lower SES and adverse drug reactions (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.01, p = 0.092). Key conclusions: Lower SES is independently associated with MRH due to non-adherence, but not ADR. This association might be mediated by lower health literacy in patients with low SES. Introduction: Falls are a major health problem in older adults and are often associated with prescription drug use [1] . In many fall-risk increasing drugs large differences in the required doses can be due to genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes [2] . We analyzed the drug-related risk of falling in community-dwelling elderly and the potential pharmacogenetic impact. Methods: Data of the ActiFE Ulm study were analyzed [3] . Participants were grouped as fallers and non-fallers according to a prospective recording over 1 year using fall calendars. Characteristics and use of drugs was compared using logistic regression analysis. Those drugs significantly associated with falls were classified according to their dependence on highly variable metabolism and transport based on information in drug labels and the pharmacogenomics databases. Results: In total, 1506 community-dwelling people aged 65 and older were enrolled. Of this cohort, 458 (32.3%) reported at least one fall with 162 (11.4%) reporting multiple falls, whereas 958 (67.7%) reported not being fallen. Polymorphic CYP enzymes were nominally more often involved in metabolism of substances taken by fallers, although not significant. Many drugs associated with falling were metabolized by phase II enzymes. Key conclusions: The impact of pharmacogenomics variation in the older adult appears to be moderate only. But confirmatory studies concerning the influence of pharmacogenomics interacting with age, drug metabolism, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy on drug-associated falls in the older adult are urgently needed [4] . Background: Cardiovascular diseases are frequent in elderly populations. Patients often need to take several drugs. Objectives: We aim to evaluate the frequency of cardiovascular drugs and assess a computer algorithm to reduce the number of drugs by substituting with polypill. Methods: Extraction of drug orders from patients admitted in a cardiogeriatric ward during 1 year (2015) . We listed all combinedfixed dose available on the market then using ATC code, spotted all cardiovascular drugs and combined every possible associations of two and three components; We created an algorithm proposing available combined-fixed dose and applied it into a random sample of 100 patients. The main criterion of judgment was the diminution of the number of drugs that would be obtained by substituting with combined fixed dose using the algorithm into the random sample (Student Test on matched data). Results: 505 patients were included. They took an average of 2.2 cardiovascular drugs. The most prescribed drugs were b-blockers (48%), statins (45%), anti-platelet agents (42%) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (42%). In France there were 87 fixed dose combined drugs marketed. In the 100 random patients sample there were 162 combinations of three components and 252 of two components. The algorithm showed that an available association could be employed in 10% of patients, reducing the number of pills from 220 to 210 (p \\ 0.01). Conclusion: Systematic use of available fixed-dose drug combinations can reduce the number of pills taken by elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases. However, available commercial associations do not match well the most frequent combinations of drugs actually prescribed to these patients.",

There is insufficient evidence to support a specific treatment of sleeping problems in acutely hospitalized older patients. Based on the little evidence available, a national guideline was published about this topic in The Netherlands in 2015. We investigated how sleeping problems are treated in Dutch hospitals and whether medical doctors followed the recommendations in the guideline.

Only 32.8% of participating geriatricians had ever been informed about the guideline, the publication of the guideline has changed their treatment of older patients with sleeping problems. Treatment decisions were mostly based on advice of a more experienced colleague (47.5%) or on the Dutch national pharmacological manual (50.8%). Key conclusions: Geriatricians were not well informed about the guideline and acted partially accordingly. Besides adherence to the guideline more evidence based treatment is needed, as most treatments occur now practice based with a rather large practice variation.",

PEP, initiated by the pharmacists of the greater Quebec City Health Board (30 NH), is an evidence based intervention to optimize pharmaceutical and nursing care, facilitated by expanded competencies empowering pharmacists and nurses. The objective was to evaluate whether PEP is: (1) reducing polypharmacy/inappropriate medications; (2) beneficial regarding adverse outcomes (emergency visits, hospitalization, falls); (3) cost-effective. Methods: PEP updates practices to recent legal changes using (1) tailored knowledge exchange sessions for pharmacists, nurses and physicians, (2) short information sessions for personal care workers and (3) leaflets for residents/their families. Pharmacists perform medication reviews in consultation with nurses, residents/families and physicians using published criteria aimed at deprescribing inappropriate medications. They use collective prescribing for a more timely treatment of minor illness such as constipation. The project was approved by the local ERB. Results: The intervention concerned 601 residents in 3 NH, a pilot (n = 96), an intervention (n = 263) and a control NH (n = 242). 10 months data show that PEP is feasible and support objective 1: the mean number of regular medications per resident fell from 12.0 in May 2017 to 10.2 medications in March 2018 in the intervention NH and from 9.9 to 9.3 in the pilot NH, as compared to 13.7 and 13.4 in the control NH. Discussion/conclusion: Preliminary data are creating a momentum to unroll PEP in further NH in the province of Quebec/Canada. Results from PEP may help to decrease inappropriate medication use in NH.",

Glomerular filtration rate is the best index of renal function. Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation is traditionally used to estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). Four variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (4vMDRD) equation has become available recently. Estimated GFR using 4vMDRD equation is readily available with routine lab results in our hospital. We aim to assess the impact of using CG and 4vMDRD equations to estimate GFR in elderly hospitalised patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study we calculated the eGFR using CG equation (CG-eGFR) for inpatients in acute elderly care wards and compared it with eGFR reported with the lab results using 4vMDRD equation (MDRD-eGFR). Results: Total of 102 patients were recruited with the median age of 85-years, of which 60.7% (62/102) were females. Mean CG-eGFR vs MDRD-eGFR was 53 ml/min/1.73 m 2 vs 67 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (p \\ 0.00). On average the difference between two estimates was 22 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . Only 31% of the patients were categorised in the same stage of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) by both methods. MDRD-eGFR overestimated renal function in CKD stages 30-44, 45-59, 60-89, [ 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 compared to CG-eGFR; the discordance was 42, 87, 63 and 79% respectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated high discordance between the estimates of GFR using CG and 4vMDRD equations. Although it is readily available with the lab results judicious consideration is warranted when using MDRD-eGFR for drug dosing in elderly patients. Larger studies are needed to further evaluate this discrepancy in older patients.",

Peeterbroeck 2 , C. Lelubre 2 , J. C. Wautrecht 2 1 CHU Charleroi, Charleroi, Belgium and GBHI, Dublin, Ireland, 2 CHU Charleroi, Charleroi, Belgium Introduction: With the use of new oral direct anticoagulants (NOACs) and their different guidelines it seemed interesting to analyze practices in real life in a geriatric hospitalized population. Methods: This is a retrospective study about all patient over 75 years old who was hospitalized in Geriatric ward (CHU Charleroi) between 01/10/2015 and 31/08/2017 and who received at least one dose of low molecular weight heparin(LMWH) and one dose of NOAC. Demographical data, reasons of anticoagulation, reasons of bridging and bleeding complications were analysed. Results: Patients were anticoagulated for the following reasons: atrial fibrillation (83.75%), pulmonary embolism (8.75%), atrial flutter (3.75%), deep vein thrombosis (3.75%). One quarter had a bridging, 31.25% received a new treatment and 43.75% had already a chronic treatment. Mean CHA2DS2-VASc was 5. The average length of stay (LOS) was 27.3 days. At the discharge, the majority (84%) had a NOAC. The main reason for ''bridging'' were gastroscopy and colonoscopy (55%) There were 8.75% bleeding complications. These bleeds were essentially digestive (3.75%) or intracranial (2.5%). Conclusion: Our results show that the main reason for anticoagulation is atrial fibrillation and there is a low rate of bleeding complications in geriatrics but the LOS is elevated. This study confirms that NOACS, used in geriatrics, give few complication but in reason of the different guidelines for the different molecules, a dissemination of the recommendations (of each NOAC as well as the algorithm of bridging) within the units would improve our practices.",

A cohort study using general practitioner data from the CPRD Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands Introduction: Currently, in patients aged 80 and above, 50-80% use statins post myocardial infarction (MI). However, evidence to support initiation and use of statins in this population lacks. Therefore our aim was to investigate effects of cumulative statin use on MI, stroke or cardiovascular mortality (primary outcome) and on overall mortality in patients 80 years and older after first MI. Methods: A cohort study in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink was conducted between January first, 1999 and February 26, 2016. A total of 3900 patients aged 80 and above, hospitalised for first MI, surviving 30 days after discharge, without statin treatment 1 year before hospitalisation, were included. Time varying Cox regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of statin treatment on the primary outcome and mortality, adjusted for confounders including frailty. HRs were converted into numbers needed to treat (NNT) and adjusted for 2 year mortality. Results: Comparing over 2 years statin treatment to no/less than 2 years statin treatment on the primary outcome resulted in a HR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.66-0.99) and a NNT of 59 over 3 years, increasing to 93 after adjusting for 36.2% mortality. Over 2 years statin treatment decreased mortality (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73-0.97). Conclusion: Protective effects of statins initiated after a first MI and continued for at least 2 years were found in patients aged 80 and older. When considering the mortality during and after hospitalisation and competing risks thereafter in old age, initiating statins may not benefit all.",

The STOPP/START criteria are intended to optimize prescription in older patients [1] . Few studies have investigated potential inappropriate prescribing (PIP) using their updated version (STOPP/STARTv2), mainly retrospectively and in community-dwellers. Methods: Multicenter prospective observational study on patients C 65 years discharged from geriatric and medicine wards between March-June 2017. STOPP/STARTv2 were applied at discharge to identify potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and potential prescribing omissions (PPOs). Death and readmissions at 6 months were investigated through telephone interviews. Variables associated with outcomes according to discharge setting (home vs medium/longterm care facility, MLTCF) were identified through multivariate logistic regression. Terminally-ill patients were excluded. Results: On a sample of 611 patients (mean age 81.6 years, 48.4% females, 34.2% MLTCF-discharged, mean drugs at discharge 7.7 \u00b1 3.2), we recorded a 71.7% PIP prevalence, with PIMs being more common than PPOs (54.9% vs 47.3%). Among other variables, a higher number of drugs at discharge was associated with both PIMs and PPOs, while geriatric discharge was protective for both. At follow-up we observed a 25.0% mortality and a 30.9% readmission rate. Neither PIMs nor PPOs were found to be associated with overall mortality both in home-discharged and in MLTCF-discharged patients. A higher number of PIMs was significantly associated with hospital readmission in home-discharged patients (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13-1.68), along with cardiac (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.03-2.74) and renal (OR 2.38, ) comorbidities, while the only variables associated with readmission in MLTCF-discharged patients were a higher drug burden (OR 1.27, ) and the presence of neurological comorbidities (OR 2.37, . Key conclusions: In this study we observed a high prevalence of PIP, involving both PIMs and PPOs. On MLTCF-discharged patients, with worse health and functional statuses, PIP according to STOPP/ STARTv2 was neither associated with death nor with readmissions. Among home-discharged patients, a higher number of PIMs was associated with hospital readmission. Introduction: DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) were introduced in Norway from 2012, and are replacing warfarin as main oral anticoagulant in Norway. Although DOACs are thought to have less drug interactions than warfarin, interactions do exist and they may have most impact on the oldest, most vulnerable patients, due to polypharmacy and multimorbidity [1] . Methods Data is collected from The Norwegian prescription registry which is nationwide and includes all pharmacy dispensings. A case from Norwegian Medicines Agency adverse drug reaction database is presented. Results: Changes in the dispensing of oral anticoagulants from 2012 to 2017 (%): warfarin 18.87-9.71, dabigatran 0.82-2.49, rivaroxaban: 0.27-5.83, apixaban: 0.07-10.23 and edoxaban: 0.00-0.08. Changes in the age group [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] . We received a report about an 87-year-old woman using dabigatran who 9 days after the start of Helicobacter Pylori eradication treatment with clarithromycin, amoxicillin and pantoprazole, was admitted to hospital. She had acute on chronic kidney failure and INR (international normalized ratio) was very high, a sign of dabigatran accumulation suspected caused by drug-drug (dabigatran-clarithromycin) and drug-disease (dabigatran-kidney failure) interactions. She was treated with dialysis and antidote idarucizumab. Key conclusions: We urge medical practitioners to be aware of the risk of drug interactions in the increasing elderly population using a DOAC.

However, interventions to reduce PIM usually do not allow a complete stop of all PIM. This study's objective is to measure the rate of PIM, which are finally continued after multidisciplinary reevaluation and record the reasons why PIM still remain. Method: Prospective study on prescriptions at admission (usual treatment) and discharge in patients over 75 years old hospitalized in acute geriatric unit from 01/25 to 04/25/2018. The aim of multidisciplinary intervention composed of a pharmacy students, pharmacy and medical residents and geriatricians, is to evaluate for each patient if PIM prescriptions according to v2 STOPP/START list are really inappropriate or not and to decide to stop or keep them. Results: In the study, 101 patients were included and 70.3% (n = 71) had at least 1 PIM at home. In all, 147 PIM were found and 72.8% (n = 107) were discontinued after the multidisciplinary intervention. There are two main situations where PIM are continued: discontinuation proposed to the general practitioner at distance of hospitalization, and treatments with clinical situation that justifies their use. These cases concerns benzodiazepines (40%, n = 16), neuroleptics (20%, n = 8), and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) (15%, n = 6). Conclusion: This study shows a high prevalence of PIM in hospitalized geriatric population and a beneficial effect of multidisciplinary intervention for their reassessment. PIM maintained at discharge are complex treatments to stop in the context of hospitalisation. A medication review at distance should be proposed to general practitioner in the discharge letter.",

Methods: We report a typical avoidable iatrogenic lactic acidosis case managed in our acute geriatric unit. Results: Mrs C, 89 years old, started suffering from lower back pain a month before hospitalization. Her usual treatment contains metformin for type 2 diabetes, valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination and rilmenidine for hypertension. A paracetamol/opium and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) drugs prescription (meloxicam and topical administration of diclofenac) is introduced. Due to an increase of pain 2 week later, a 30 mg long-acting and 10 mg immediate release morphine prescription is added. Three days later, Mrs C is admitted to the emergency department for delirium. Clinically, she presents a bradypnea (7/mn) and depressed conscious status. A lactic acidosis and a respiratory failure were diagnosed related to metformin overdose in an iatrogenic ARF context and a morphine overdose. She is then admitted to intensive care unit where she is dialyzed, an antagonization of morphine is done and her usual treatment is stopped. Three weeks later, we notice a partial recovery of the renal function (CrCl: 34 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (CKDEPI/3 months ago: CrCl: 51 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Conclusion: Although this adverse effect is well known, this case report reminds us the need for adapting metformin dosage with renal function, and to avoid combination of drugs at risk of ARF. Furthermore, NSAIDs drugs are potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly with a CrCl \\ 50 mL/mn according to the STOPP list.",

This is termed 'Payment by Results (PbR)' and is based on a national tariff system [1] . Whilst PbR was designed to reward efficiency and to focus care towards quality and innovation, there are inherent difficulties related to coding accuracy, which is largely dependent on clinical record quality [1] [2] [3] . Coding is performed by clinical coders, who are not permitted to interpret records. Failure to document secondary diagnoses and complications is a common source of under-coding and lost revenue [2, [4] [5] . We hypothesised that physician case-note summarisation would improve documentation and accuracy of coding in older vascular patients. Methods: During a 6 months run-up period (emerging project), we structured a multi-professional network (digestive surgeons, anesthetists, geriatricians, digestive oncologists, epidemiologists), we elaborated a innovative peri-operative geriatric intervention (Improved program) in digestive surgery setting based on evidence-based data. We build a dedicated evaluation plan by determinate the best design for assessing geriatric intervention in this complex context and choose the more appropriate endpoints.",

Anxiety was measured 4 times a day using the trait part of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T). Heart rate variability was measured using a sensor patch (Health Patch). Log transformed HF and LF/HF values in the hour before the highest STAI-T were compared to the values in the hour before the lowest STAI-T scores using paired sample T Test. Results: Complete data was available for 24 participants. In the hour before the highest STAI-T Mean HF was significantly lower in 5 subjects and mean LF/HF significantly higher in 4 subjects. In most subjects there was no significant difference in HRV measurements. Conclusions: Perceived stress was not reflected in HF and LF/HF values. Discussion: HRV is not a good measure for pre surgery stress in elderly; this could be due to loss of complexity in the heart rate signal with ageing [2] . Introduction: Older patients have stated that subjective well-being is one of their most important treatment outcomes [1, 2] . We hypothesized that peri-operative anxiety could be an important factor in changes in well-being during chirurgical trajectories. Methods: Thirty-five patients aged 65 and up, admitted for planned and unplanned surgery were included. Wellbeing was measured shortly after admission and one month after discharge using the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI: 0-100 (= best)). Anxiety was measured 3 to 4 times a day during hospital stay using the trait part of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T: 6-24 (= most anxiety)). Change in PWI and STAI-T were correlated by Pearson's R. Group analysis was performed by comparing STAI-T among participants with an increased PWI to participants with a decrease. Introduction: The widespread use of bisphosphonate therapy as an affordable solution against osteoporosis has led to the occurrence of a complication of atypical fractures in the femur. The way these fractures appear and develop can include them in the category of stress fractures. The global population aging phenomenon will bring a new challenge for the medical system, namely establishing optimal diagnostic recommendations and treatment. Methods: The case presented is of a 64-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with a left subtrochanteric fracture following a low energy trauma. Bisphosphonate treatment was initiated 6 years ago, at menopause, the patient receiving 70 mg of alendronic acid weekly. After a period of 2 years, the patient developed a similar fracture at the right hip level. Results: The initial fracture, the one at the level of the left hip, was operated and a Dynamic Condylar Screw (DCS) system was used for osteosynthesis. Consolidation evolved with difficulty and healing was achieved after 6 months. In case of fracture at the right hip we chose a centromedular implant represented by the Gamma nail, healing occurring much faster, after a 3-month interval.",

Methods: Observational study of patients admitted to the unit between November 2017 and January 2018. We registered variables related to demographic, social, clinical characteristics, blood test results and perioperatory data. The primary outcome was to determine the incidence of delirium based on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and DSM-V criteria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to analyse the variables. In-hospital mortality associated with the incidence of delirium was also evaluated. Results: We included 111 patients. Seventy-one women (64%), average age 85.5 \u00b1 7.76. Procedence: Home 100 (90.1%), nursing home 6 (5.4%), others 5 (4.5% 4-5.3) . Conclusions: Despite the comprehensive geriatric intervention, the incidence of delirium is very high in elderly patients admitted for hip fracture, especially among the male patients and those with dementia. Suffering delirium increases the risk of mortality. Therefore, next to comprehensive geriatric intervention, the implementation of additional preventive measures to decrease the incidence of delirium in the acute phase of hip fracture is required.

However, there is limited evidence supporting the use of frailty scores in predicting mortality. This study describes the influence of frailty, measured using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), in older people undergoing emergency laparotomy. Methods: All patients aged 75-years or older who underwent emergency laparotomy between 8th September 2014 to 30th March 2017 were included in this prospective non-randomised study. Frailty was defined as CFS score of 5 or more. The primary aim was to establish if there was a relationship between CFS score and mortality. Results: 113 patients were included and 37 (32.7%) had a CFS score of 5-9. Frailty became more prevalent with increasing age. There was no significant difference in length of stay between the cohorts but mean time to readmission was significantly longer in those with a CFS score of 1-4 compared to those with a CFS 5-9 (451 days vs 266 days, p = 0.009). 77.9% of all patients survived to discharge (82.9% CFS 1-4 vs 67.6% CFS 5-9 p = 0.065) and 12-month mortality rate was significantly higher in the frail population (59.5% vs 28.9%, p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that death within 12-months was 7.068 times more likely in frail patients. Conclusion: Frail patients undergoing emergency laparotomy have a shorter time to readmission and a higher 12-month mortality rate.

The present analysis aimed to identify the factors that promote a complete recovery of the prefracture motor function. Methods: Of 2570 enrolled, we considered 587 patients (mean age 84 \u00b1 7 years, 453 female) who were able to walk before the fracture and who had a follow-up. We compared data on pre-fracture motor function with that referring at 30 and 120 days of follow-up. Results: At 30 days of follow-up, the 24% of patients (140/587) recovered a complete pre-fracture motor function, while the percentage grown up to 44% (181/391) at 120 days. We found that a short term complete recovery (30 days) was significantly associated with continuous geriatric management, compared to only pre-operative or post-operative involvement (29% vs 19%, p = 0.07). Conversely, a long term complete recovery (120 days) occurred significantly in patients with fewer comorbidities (ASA score \\ 3 55% vs ASA score C 3 42%, p = 0.02), and those in osteo-metabolic treatment (51% vs 39%, p = 0.02). We also observed that patients who experienced delirium during hospitalization had a worse longterm motor recovery. Key conclusion: The geriatric management could facilitate a complete short-term motor recovery when its occurred since hospitalization and continues throughout the length of hospital stay. Conversely, other factors could influence long-term motor recovery, such as comorbidity, osteo-metabolic therapy and the development of delirium, emphasizing a greater frailty of the elderly patient.",

Methods: We enrolled 534 patients with hip fracture, aged 75 years or older in an Orthogeriatric Unit of the University Hospital from Le\u00f3n (Spain) , between December 2013 and November 2014. The cognitive impairment grades were divided into 3 groups (severe/moderate; mild; and no impairment). Descriptive characteristics, complications and ambulation capacity at discharge were collected. Results: Among the 534 participants, 499 (93%) underwent surgery. The mean age was 86.1 \u00b1 7.3 years (75-105 years).

Methods: 3 years retrospective study (January 2015 and December 2017 , cognitive impairment 36.7%, ), CIRS-G 12 (IQR 9-16). Diabetes 25.7%. The 86.9% use antidiabetic drugs (insulin 23.0%, oral antidiabetic 70.5%). Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.5 \u00b1 1.2.

Sedatives, anxiolytics and antidepressants may increase the risk of fall. Neuroleptics inhibit dopaminergic receptors and may therefore increase prolactin secretion and thus decrease bone mineral density (BMD). We aim to investigate the intake of these drugs in patients admitted for hip fracture in our Hospital and its relationship with evolution. Method: Observational, longitudinal, prospective study of 534 patients, aged 75 years or older, admitted for hip fracture during 2014. Variables: age, sex, cognitive and functional baseline and discharge status and taking of psychotropic drugs. The possible relationship between these variables was analyzed. SPSS \u00d2 , v.22.0. Results: Among the 534 participants, 499 (93%) underwent surgery. 75.4% were women and the mean age 86.1 \u00b1 7.3 years. Only 132 (25%) had a previous diagnosis of dementia. 64% walk independently. 26% live in nursing homes prior to fracture. 69% had Barthel [ 60. They take benzodiazepines 35%, antidepressants 32% and neuroleptics 9.7%. All were related (p \\ .001) with worse ambulation at admission and discharge (p \\ .01). Benzodiazepines were more frequent (49%) in the nonagenarian group (p \\ .001) and antidepressants in women (35% vs. 23%). No relation was found (p [ .05) with in-hospital mortality or with the presentation of delirium. Conclusions: Patients with psychotropic drugs at admission have worse cognitive and functional status and also worse ambulation. The intake of benzodiazepines is high in the group of nonagenarians. Geriatric assessment during hip fracture admission improves the prescription of these drugs.",

Steroid metabolome in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in controls is being compared and its relationship to glucose metabolism is being assessed. The aim of our study is to build a predictive model based on steroid data. Results: Some components of steroid metabolome differ between the group of Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls of the same age. Significant differences in levels of C21 and 5b-reduced metabolites of C19 steroids were found. Conclusions: According to preliminary results, some components of steroid metabolome are very promising in prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Our new study aims to simplify the prediction model and make it applicable to clinical practice, thanks to detection of neuroactive biomarkers in peripheral blood. Hip fracture (HF) is a common and devastating injury as well as a major health issue in old age. HF has a one-year mortality [ 30% in the elderly and is a frequent cause of institutionalization. The reasons for such poor outcomes in this trauma are multifactorial but we aim here at identifying immunological factors, which can influence and/or predict the outcome of hip trauma in elderly patients post-surgery. We analyze immunological parameters evocating of the Immune Risk Phenotype in sequential pre-and post-surgical blood samples collected from HF patients over 75 years of age. The study revealed that HF is associated with an immune scar depicting a transient T-cell leucopenia and an acute hyper-inflammation. Importantly, we show that blood level of a molecule released by activated monocytes (neopterin) is predictive of one-year mortality in these patients. Its plasmatic level correlated negatively with the time of survival after HF surgery. In conclusion, HF patients exhibit transient changes in innate and adaptive immunity. Meanwhile, profound acute inflammatory processes measurable pre-surgery occur, which are predictive of long-term survival after HF surgery. We propose to use the identified predictive biomarker to improve medical interventions and follow-up of patients at risk of death.",

The effect of the intervention has been evaluated on numerous markers related with IP and inflammation, including the gut microbial ecosystem (i.e. gut microbiota composition and related metabolites), blood bacterial loads and the serum/urine metabolomics. Key conclusions: Standard methodologies for IP evaluation cannot be easily applied in the older population, thus zonulin and total bacterial load can be considered valuable candidate biomarkers. The MaPLE project will contribute to identify non-invasive strategies to improve IP and related disorders in the older population. Background: Two different simple frailty scales were used to identify the prevalence and severity of frailty in older adults with acute medical conditions and geriatric syndromes admitted to acute geriatrics ward to assess the effect of frailty on discharge planning without additional clinical resources. Methods: Clinical frailty scales (CFS) and reported Edmonton frailty scales (REFS) were completed based on electronic medical records (EMR) and REFS questionnaire for 107 patients. Patients' demography, medical conditions and main outcomes (length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rates, discharge accommodations) were analysed divided into frail versus non-frail groups and according to frailty severities. Variables with P \\ 0.2 in univariate analysis were included for multi-regression analysis to assess the impact of frailty on outcome measures. Results: Prevalence of frailty was 75 percent for both scales out of which approximately 50 percent have mild to moderate frailty. LOS was increased in the frail group and correlated with the severity of frailty. Demographic data and medical comorbidities were not statistically different. LOS, 30-day readmission rate and dementia were increased based on CFS severity. Patients transferred to rehabilitation units were not necessarily frail and same outcome as non-frail group. Frailty was the only significant variable for LOS in univariate analysis but not for 30-day readmission rates and discharge destination in univariate analysis. Conclusion: Severity of frailty is correlated with increased LOS. CFS may be more useful to detect frailty.",

Ding 1 1 Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Malacca, Malaysia, 2 Sengkang Hospital, Singapore Introduction: Although low muscle mass has been linked to early manifestations in the natural history of frailty, contradictory findings exist about the impact of different definitions on frailty status. We aim to study the relationship between three widely used muscle mass definitions with frailty status in an Asian population. Methods: We studied 200 community-dwelling older adults from the GERILABS cohort study. We compared three DXA-based definitions of muscle mass: appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted for height squared (ALM/Ht2) using Asian Working Group cutoffs; ALM adjusted for body mass index [ALM/BMI]; and residuals of linear regression on ALM adjusted for fat mass and height (ALM-res). Frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail and frail) was defined according to modified Fried criteria. We examined the relationship between frailty status and muscle mass using scatter plot with Lowess smoothing and multinomial logistic regression adjusted for age and gender. Results: Prevalence of frailty among those with low muscle mass was 8.8% (ALM/Ht2), 5.5% (ALM/BMI), and 4.4% (ALM-res) respectively. Conversely, among frail participants, the prevalence of low muscle mass was 72.7, 27.3 and 18.2% respectively. A linear relationship with frailty was observed for ALM/Ht2, but not ALM/BMI or ALM-res. In multinomial logistic regression, each unit increase in ALM/Ht2 was associated with 41% (95% CI 12-61, p = 0.010) lower odds of being pre-frail, and 70% (95% CI 9-90, p = 0.034) lower odds of being frail as opposed to robust. ALM/BMI and ALM-res were not associated with pre-frailty/frailty after adjustment. Conclusion: Our results support sarcopenia and frailty as inter-related but distinct entities, with muscle mass-frailty association inferences altered substantially by the definition employed. Contrary to earlier non-Asian studies, ALM/Ht2 was strongly, linearly and inversely related to pre-frailty/frailty status in our Asian cohort.",

Design and setting: Sarcopenia was diagnosed using the criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). Hand grip strength and skeletal muscle mass were measured using Jamar dynamometer and bioelectrical impedance analysis, respectively. Physical function was assessed with the Short Physical Performance Battery. Dependency status was defined by Barthel-Index (BI).

The study aimed to test whether there is a relationship between these plasma circulating proteins and muscle strength, power and optimal shortening velocity (topt) of older adults. Methods: The cross-sectional study included 56 women and 45 men aged 60 years and older. Every participant underwent examination which included anthropometric and bioimpedance analysis measurements, functional and cognitive performance tests, muscle strength of upper and lower extremities, muscle power testing with two different methods and blood analyses. Results: Women had higher plasma levels of myostatin and GDF11 than men. Men had higher plasma level of follistatin than women. In women, plasma level of myostatin was negatively correlated with left handgrip strength and mopt. Follistatin was negatively correlated with maximum power (Pmax), Pmax\u00c1kg -1 and P70% leg press, and positively correlated with the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. GDF11 was negatively correlated with body mass, body mass index, waist circumference, fat mass and the percentage of body fat. In men, there were no significant correlations observed between circulating plasma proteins and muscle function measures. Key conclusions: The circulating plasma myostatin and follistatin are negatively associated with muscle function in older women and the relationship between these proteins is more visible for muscle power than muscle strength.

The aim of the current study was to investigate trends in frailty and the relationship between frailty and mortality across a period of 21 years. Methods: Data from 1995 to 2016 were used from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. A total of 7742 observations of 2874 respondents aged 65-84 years across 6 measurement waves were included. Frailty was measured with a 32-item frailty index (FI), with a cut-off of 0.25 to indicate frailty. The outcome measure was 4-year mortality. Trends in frailty and its association with 4-year mortality were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis. Results: The GEE analyses showed that the 4-year mortality rate declined between 1995 and 2016 in both people with and without frailty. In the same observation period, levels of frailty slightly increased. Across all measurement waves, frailty was associated with 4-year mortality (OR 2.57, 95% CI 2.03-3.25). The OR slightly increased in more recent measurement waves. However, there was no statistically significant interaction effect between frailty and time on 4-year mortality, indicating that the association between frailty and mortality remained the same during the period of observation. Key conclusions: Between 1995 and 2016, the prevalence of frailty increased among older adults aged 65-84 years, but the lethality of frailty did not change, as there was a stable trend in the frailtymortality relationship.",

The SARC-F questionnaire may be considered as a suitable tool for community screening for sarcopenia. Our objective was to explore whether the SARC-F is related to muscle mass (MM), strength (MS) and power (MP). Methods: In the population-based African American Health (AAH) study, MM, MS and MP were evaluated in a clinical testing center in a subsample of n = 190 women. MM was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). MS and MP were evaluated by knee extensor and flexor tests (using an isokinetic dynamometer; Biodex Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, NY). The SARC-F self-report questionnaire items were coded using these 5 items: sluggishness, assistance in walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs, falls. The questionnaire score ranged from 0 to 10: [using a previously determined cut point] a sarcopenia was defined as a score C 4. Results: Participants with SARC-F C 4 had lower household income, worse self-rated health and poorer income than those with SARC-F \\ 4. They also had a higher BMI than participants with SARC-F \\ 4 (p \\ .001). AAH women participants with SARC-F scores C 4 had significantly higher MM (p .022), lower MS (p .001) and lower MP (p \\ .001) than participants with SARC-F scores \\ 4. Conclusion: Participants who screened positive using the SARC-F questionnaire showed lower muscle function, predisposing them to greater vulnerability in functional activities. This, combined with the simplicity of use for SARC-F, justifies its use as the initial step in identifying the presence of sarcopenia.",

ADVANTAGE conducted a systematic search on evidence supporting frailty prevention and management activities which crystalize on a State of the Art Report. Main results support that frailty management should be directed towards comprehensive and holistic treatment in multiple and related fields. Prevention calls for a multifaceted approach addressing life course factors. ADVANTAGE recommends that all persons older than 70 years attending health care services should be screened for frailty. Geriatric Comprehensive Assessment, incorporated for assessment of frailty and planning a personalized multidomain treatment render better outcomes. Therefore, we propose a number of instruments for the screening phase and others for the diagnostic one. Physical exercise (multidomain and strength training) in combination with adequate nutrition have proved to be the best treatment of frailty. Other useful actions are reduction of polypharmacy, moderate weight loss in combination with appropriate physical activity, Vitamin D supplementation in some cases, and use of ICTs.",

Methods: All geriatric inpatients from SAGE whose dataset allowed for the diagnosis of sarcopenia (EWGSOP definition) and osteoporosis (WHO definition) were included. In addition to dual energy X-ray absorptiometry derived muscle mass and bone mineral density, functional (gait speed, hand grip, Barthel index) and nutritional characteristics (mini nutritional assessment short form (MNA-SF), body mass index (BMI)) were measured for comparison between sarcopenic, osteoporotic osteosarcopenic and normal (reference group). Results: 141/148 of SAGE participants (84 women, 57 men; mean age 80.6 + 5.5) met inclusion criteria. 22/141 (15.6%) were only osteoporotic, 19/141 (13.5%) were only sarcopenic and 20/141 (14.2%) osteosarcopenic (both conditions present).

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we explored potential associations between gait speed and mortality, CVD and cancer. Methods: A systematic search in major databases was undertaken until March 15th 2018 for prospective cohort studies reporting data on gait speed and mortality, incident CVD and cancer. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), based on the model with the maximum number of covariates for each study between gait speed (categorized as decrease in 0.1 m/s) and mortality, incident CVD and cancer were meta-analysed with a random effects model. Results: Among 7026 papers, 44 articles corresponding to 48 cohorts were eligible. The studies followed-up a total of 101,945 participants (mean age 72.2 years; 55% women) for a median of 5.4 years. After adjusting for a median of 9 potential confounders and the presence of publication bias, each reduction of 0.1 m/s in gait speed was associated with a 14% increased risk of earlier mortality (45 studies; HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.09-1.14; I222 = 90%) and 8% increased risk of CVD (13 studies; HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03-1.13; I223 = 81%), but no relationship with cancer was observed. Conclusions: Slow gait speed may be a predictor of mortality and CVD in older adults. Since gait speed is a quick and inexpensive measure to obtain, our study suggests that it may help identify people at risk of premature mortality and CVD.",

However, before its use in clinical practice, several methodological aspects still need to be addressed. Both standardization in measurement techniques as the availability of reference values are currently lacking. This study aims to provide an evidence-based standardization of assessing muscle with the use of US. Methods: A systematic review was performed for ultrasonography, older people and muscle assessment. Pubmed, SCOPUS and Web of Sciences were searched. All manuscripts regarding the use of US in assessing appendicular muscle were used.

Methods: The SarcoPhAge project includes 534 community-dwelling older adults. Sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass plus low grip strength and decreased physical performance. Data on adverse outcomes were recorded during a clinic visit or with a phone call. The association between sarcopenia and the occurrence of undesirable outcomes was tested using the Cox proportional hazards model or a logistic regression model. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the power of 5 definitions to predict outcomes. Results: 534 subjects were recruited (73.5 \u00b1 6.2 years, 60.5% female). After 3 years, 33 participants were lost to follow-up. No association between sarcopenia and falls, fractures, disabilities or institutionalizations was highlighted. A higher number of deaths occurred in individuals with sarcopenia than in those who were not with (16.2% versus 4.6%, p-value \\ 0.001). The probability of death within 3 years when presenting sarcopenia showed an approximately threefold increase (for 4 out 5 definitions). A longer hospital stay was observed in subjects with sarcopenia only when defined using the EWGSOP algorithm or the Asian Working Group criteria. Key conclusions: Over a 3-year period, sarcopenia at baseline was associated with an increased risk of mortality and with longer hospital stays. There were significant variations in the ability of the different definitions of sarcopenia to predict these outcomes.",

Although, hemodynamic factor is considered to be an important contributor in the development of sarcopenia, there were few studies regarding this topic. Thus, we tried to investigate the relationship between blood pressure variability and skeletal muscle mass in nation-wide large population cohort. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on data acquired in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), conducted from 2009 to 2011 by the Korean Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. We included 3069 participants (age C 65 years, male 1342) for the analysis who had both blood pressure and whole-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan data. As an intra-individual within-visit blood pressure variability index, we calculated standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), and maximum minus minimum BP difference (MMD) of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which was measured 3 times. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was the sum of lean masses of both arms and legs. We adjusted ASM by body mass index. Results: Significant inverse relationship was observed between blood pressure variability index (SD, CV, and MMD) and adjusted ASM. Blood pressure variability index were significantly higher in the lowest quartile group both in male and female participants (p \\ 0.05). In multivariate analysis, blood pressure variability index were significantly associated with ASM, even after adjusting confounding factors. Conclusions: Using the national representative database, we showed significant inverse relationship between within-visit blood pressure variability and skeletal muscle mass in Korean older adults.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the association of anthropometric measurements (body mass index, knee-adjusted height body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and calf circumference) with mortality risk in a group of older Mexican adults. Methods: This is a longitudinal analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging sub-sample (with biomarkers, n = 2573) from the first wave in 2001, followed-up to the last available wave in 2015. Only frail 50-year or older adults (Frailty Index with a cut-off value of 0.21 or higher, was used) were considered for this analysis (n = 1298). A survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models (unadjusted and adjusted for confounding). Sociodemographic, health risks, physical activity and comorbidities were variables used for adjusting the multivariate models. Results: From the total sample of 1298 older adults, 32.5% (n = 422) died during follow-up. The highest hazard ratio in the adjusted model was for calf circumference 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.69, p = 0.034). Other measurements were not significant. Conclusions: Anthropometric measurements have different significance in frail older adults, and these differences could have implications on adverse outcomes.

SF is a risk factor for adverse health events: mortality, disability, falls and hospitalization. Most of the interventions to revert SF cant be implemented in primary care (PC). There is no standard model for the follow-up frail elderly in PC. Objective: Evaluate the efficacy of a PC geriatric intervention model in reversion SF. Methods: Randomized, unicentric, clinical trial, comparing usual care and a geriatric intervention model. 240 frail individuals followed in primary health care and community residents. Inclusion criteria: age [ 70 years; FS present; community residents and no institutionalization plan. Exclusion criteria: cognitive impairment, institutionalization, hospitalization \\ 1 month. ''blinding'': The family doctor will not access to evaluations results. The evaluations will be available to Intervention geriatric team (IGT). Evaluators: can't be members of IGT; randomly assigned to evaluations; not have access to the results of previous evaluations. Intervention: IGT by 12 months. Individualized care, starts with a global assessment and a home evaluation. Nurse appointment every month. Medical appointment 2/2 months or 3/3 if frailty reverts. If nutrition risk-nutritionist appointment. Individualized care plan by IGT, after each evaluation. Evaluations: basal, 6 months and final. Conclusion: A model of geriatric follow-up that proves to be more effective in the reversion of frailty will be an advantage in PCs. The use of PC resources results in the operationalization of the model and possible immediate clinical application. Introduction: Many older patients experience polypharmacy and risk taking potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) leading to adverse events. Recent studies have demonstrated the association between frailty and an increase in PIMs among community-dwelling older people and those with cancer. We evaluated whether frailty in hospitalised older patients is associated with polypharmacy and PIMs. Methods: A cross-sectional study of inpatients aged C 70 years admitted to one UK hospital. Frailty was assessed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype and FRAIL Scale. Polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy were defined as the concomitant use of five+ and 10+ medications, respectively. PIMs were identified using the Beers and STOPP criteria. Results: 201 participants (median age 80.7 years; 120 (60%) men) were recruited. 1738 medications were prescribed in this cohort, median 9 medications/patient. Frailty was identified in 56 and 36% using the Fried Frailty Phenotype and FRAIL scale, respectively. Polypharmacy (46%) and hyper-polypharmacy (41%) were also common. Frailty using both scales was significantly associated with polypharmacy (P \\ 0.001). The Beers' criteria identified 90 PIMs in 57 (28%) patients. 33 (58%) received one and 24 (42%) received 2+ PIMs. 108 PIMs in 76 (38%) patients were identified using the STOPP criteria. 53 patients (70%) received one and 23 (30%) received 2+ PIMs. Both frailty tools were significantly associated with PIMs using the STOPP criteria but not using the Beers' criteria. Conclusions: Frailty in older inpatients was significantly associated with polypharmacy and PIMs using the STOPP criteria. Structured medication review is essential for older people in hospital.",

Methods: Independence in performing ADL was assessed in 30 older, nursing home residents (age, 85.6 \u00b1 7.06 years; weight, 65.4 \u00b1 15.41 kg; height, 1.60 \u00b1 .06 m), with the Resident Assessment Instrument. Residents were categorized as either independent or dependent in basic ADL. Muscle thickness and echo intensity, isometric grip-, quadriceps-and elbow-flexor strength, gait speed, timed sit-to-stand task and physical activity were determined by validated assessments. Relationships among variables were investigated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and logistic regression analysis. Results: The category of dependence in ADL correlated with handgrip strength (= -.38, p = .038), quadriceps strength (= -.67, p \\ .01), elbow-flexor strength (= -.42, p = .032) and physical activity (= -.44, p = .015). After regression analysis, only quadriceps strength remained a significant determinant of dependence category (R2 = .66; Wald(1) = 5.97, p = .015). For every 0.1 kg decrease in quadriceps strength the risk of being dependent in basic ADL increased by 10%. Conclusion: Quadriceps strength has a strong, independent relationship with ADL performance in nursing home residents. Improving quadriceps strength may help to avoid further decline in physical function. Introduction: Frailty and osteoarthritis (OA) cause functional and movement limitation in elderly, which both have common pathophysiology and risk factors that have not been completely defined yet. The purpose is figure out the relationship between frailty and osteoarthritis for preventive and therapeutic approach in a community base cohort of elderly household dwellers.",

The sampling was multistage stratified-cluster method that representative of the general population, aged C 60 by interviewing in southern of Iran. Clinical OA defined with any symptoms in knee or other joints without history of Rheumatic disease or diagnosis of osteoarthritis by clinicians. Based on Fried Frailty phenotype criteria, individuals with three or more criteria considered as frail that examine as dependent variable in a univariate and several multivariable logistic regression models. Results: From older participants (N = 2315) female were 50.8%. The mean age was 69.27 (SD = 6.30) years old. The prevalence of frailty was 7.7% (N = 174) and osteoarthritis was 12.4% (N = 286). In Univariate model odds ratio (OR) of osteoarthritis for frailty phenotype was 1.99 (95% CI 1.35-2.93) . In final multivariable model after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, and smoking the OR of osteoarthritis for frailty phenotype was 2.44 (95% CI 1.57-3.78). Conclusion: Based on our results, osteoarthritis is a strong independent predictor of frailty phenotype in community elderly dwellers. It is needed further evaluation to understand the causal relationship through a longitudinal study. Introduction: In older adults frailty is linked to increase muscle atrophy due to inflammation, decline in humoral, cell-mediated immunity and hormone levels, overexpression of cytokines and sarcopenia. Due to poor appetite, reduced mobility and isolation, frail older people do not meet their caloric, protein and micronutrient targets with food alone, and often need the use of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) providing sufficient amounts of calories, protein and micronutrients in a relatively low volume to improve compliance. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA), vitamin E, vitamin D along with the protein bound amino acids glycine, arginine and tryptophan are proposed as active novel ingredients in the therapy of patients with sarcopenia and/or frailty; due to their combined effect in muscle atrophy thereby improving muscle protein synthesis (MPS). The study objective is to show efficacy of PUFA, vitamin E, vitamin D and the protein bound amino acids glycine, arginine and tryptophan as active ingredients to increase MPS in human myoblasts. Methods: The MyoScreenTM muscle wasting platform is based on the treatment of human primary myoblasts with TNF-alpha to induce muscle atrophy. We tested the ability of the active ingredients of Fresubin 3.2 kcal to increase whole protein synthesis measured by the Click-iT \u00d2 HPG Alexa Fluor \u00d2 Protein Synthesis Assay (Ther-moFisher) on the MyoScreenTM platform. Results: The active ingredients of Fresubin 3.2 kcal increased protein synthesis in primary human myoblasts after 6 days of treatment. Conclusion: The active ingredients of low volume Fresubin 3.2 kcal, increased protein synthesis in TNF-alpha incubated myoblasts and thus may reduce TNF-alpha related atrophy in muscles.",

Methods: The study included 213 respondents (59 men and 154 women) aged 80 and over. Respondents were assessed using the Fried criteria: weight loss, weakness, low physical activity, slowness and exhaustion. All underwent assessment using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and activities of daily living (ADL). Results: Frailty was found in 117 persons in the studied group. The analysis showed that the results in the frail group were much worse than the results in the pre-frail and non-frail groups in all the criteria looked at. After 12 months a significant deterioration of ADL, an increased risk of hospitalisation and death was observed in the frail group, with additional higher mortality among men in this group. Conclusion: The study shows that significant risk of hospitalisation, ADL deterioration and death occurs more often in the group of persons aged 80 or over with diagnosed FS than in the pre-frail and nonfrail group. Men are more at risk of death than women, especially in the frail group. The occurrence of the FS plays an important role in the prognosis and assessment of the need for health care among the elderly.",

Geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) often suffer from mobility limitations. The aim of the current study is to investigate the association of T2D and the change in muscle mass or function in old age and whether it is influenced by insulin treatment in diabetics in the population-based KORA AGE study. Methods: In a population-based cohort study (KORA Age) the skeletal muscle index (SMI [kg/m 2 ]) and the hand grip strength (HS [kg] ) were measured at baseline (2009) and timed Up and Go (TUG [s]) test performed after a follow-up time of 3 years (2012). Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the influence of T2D and insulin therapy on the change of muscle parameters (difference of baseline and follow-up values). Results: Among the 731 subjects (360 women (49.3%)) with a mean age of 74.6 \u00b1 6.2 years) there were 16.1% (n = 118) with T2D (HbA1c 6.4 \u00b1 0.7%), who were treated with insulin in 16.9% (n = 20). Patients with T2D showed a greater decrease in HK (women: -1.2 \u00b1 4.3, men: -1.8 \u00b1 5.4) and SMI (women: -0.2 \u00b1 0.7, men: -0.2 \u00b1 0.7) subjects without T2D (women: -0.5 \u00b1 3.9, men: -0.4 \u00b1 5.5). After adjustment for gender, age, BMI, physical activity, smoking, and multimorbidity, T2D remains significant with the change in SMI (p = 0.02), but not in HS (p = 0.07) and TUG (p = 0.76). Insulin therapy was significantly associated with the change in SMI (p \\ 0.001), but not with HS (p = 0.18) and TUG (p = 0.09), compared to treatment with oral antidiabetic alone in subjects with treated T2D. Key conclusions: Patients with T2D showed an accelerated decline in muscle mass in subject over 65 years of age compared to subjects without T2D. Therefore, routine clinical muscle assessment in this high-risk population might be useful. Insulin therapy could be of benefit to the maintenance of muscle mass for the elderly with T2D. However, further studies are needed to confirm this result.",

Traditionally concentric training is employed, but this may not be as effective/feasible as eccentric training.

Leg muscle-mass was estimated by thigh circumference (TC) and DXA-scanning, strength by 6 min walk test (6MWT), leg press test (LP) and 30-sec chair-stand test (30CST). Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) measured by Borg scale (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .

Design: Cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study. Setting: Geriatric outpatient clinic. Participants: Older adults C 65 years. Measurements: Muscle mass, hand grip strength, and usual gait speed. Currently used diagnostic criteria EWGSOP, FNIH, IWGS, and SCWD were applied. SARC-CalF was performed by using two different calf circumference (CC) threshold: standard cut-off 31 cm (SARC-CalF-31) and national cut-off 33 cm (SARC-CalF-33). The sensitivity/specificity analyses of the SARC-CalF and SARC-F tools were run. Results: We included 207 subjects; 67 male and 140 female with a mean age of 74.6 \u00b1 6.7 years. The prevalence of sarcopenia ranged from 1.9 to 9.2%. The sensitivity of SARC-F was between 25% (EWGSOP) and 50% (IWGS); specificity was about 82%. For SARC-CalF-31 and SARC-CalF-33 sensitivity was similar-between 25-50%-which pointed out that SARC-CalF was not superior to SARC-F for senstivity in this sample. Corresponding specificities for SARC-CalF-31 and SARC-CalF-33 were higher than SARC-F and were between 90-98%. The AUC values, which indicates the diagnostic accuracy of a screening test, were in general higher for SARC-CalF-33 than the SARC-F and SARC-CalF-31. Conclusions: We reported that addition of CC item to SARC-F improved the specificity and diagnostic accuracy of SARC-F but it didn't improve the sensitivity in a community-dwelling Turkish older adult population sample that had low prevalence of sarcopenia. The performance of SARC-CalF tool to screen sarcopenia is to be studied in different populations and living settings.",

Positive predictive values (PV) were between 5.1-15.4% and negative PVs were 92.3-98.2%. Low MM, sensitivity were about 20% and specificity were about 81%. For low HGS, sensitivity of SARC-F were 33.7% (Turkish cutoff); 50% (FNIH cut-off); specificity were 93.7% (Turkish cut-off) and 85.8% (FNIH cut-off). Against low UGS, poor performance in CSS, FRT, SPPB and presence of positive frailty screening sensitivity were 58.3%, 39.2%, 59.1%, 55.2%, 52.1% while specificity were 97.3%, 97.8%, 88.1%, 99.3%, 91.2%, respectively. Conclusion: The psychometric performance of Turkish SARC-F was similar to the original SARC-F. It revealed low sensitivity but high specificity with all sarcopenia definitions. Sensitivity and specificity were higher for muscle function (MF) tests reflecting its inquiry and input on MF. Our findings suggest that SARC-F is an excellent test to exclude MF impairment and sarcopenia. SARC-F is relatively a good screening test for functional measures.",

We aimed to examine the association between social frailty and new-onset frailty and cognitive decline in community-dwelling elderly adults. Methods: The longitudinal surveys with randomly selected community-dwelling older adults aged C 65 years were performed in annually from 2012 to 2014. We exclude physically frail individuals at baseline. Physical frailty was defined by the Cardiovascular Health Study index. Cognitive decline was determined using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with deceased score of greater than 1.0 point per 1 year. Social frailty was operationally defined using a deficit accumulation model referred to previous study in Japan. Results: Of 1422 elderly who were included in this study. 9.7% of participants experienced developing frailty, and 4.7% experienced cognitive decline during the follow-up period. Baseline prevalence of social prefrailty (1/5 score) was 30% and it of social frailty (C 2/5) was 21%. Adjusted by confounding factors (such as age, instrumental activity of daily living), those who with social frailty were found to be significantly at risk of new-onset frailty (the hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.4) , and cognitive decline (the hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.1). Key conclusions: Our research showed strong impact of social frailty on the risk of new onset of physical frailty and cognitive decline in community-dwelling elderly adults. To prolong healthy life expectancy, considering interventions for social frailty via multidimensional approaches may be indispensable.",

In this sense, the aim of this study was to identify important items of quality of life of frail older subjects. Methods: A Delphi survey was conducted among professionals in the field of frailty (i.e. members of the working groups on frailty from the EUGMS or ESCEO). We also performed two focus groups, one in frail community-dwelling older subjects and one in frail nursing home residents. Frailty was assessed using different definitions. Results: The important items to assess quality of life related to frailty, highlighted by frail patients themselves (n = 14) or by professionals (n = 35), have been indexed in 6 domains, based on the concept of intrinsic capacity proposed by the WHO: locomotion, sensory, vitality, psychosocial, cognition and others. Respectively 78 and 52 items have been highlighted by the Delphi Approach and the focus groups. Globally, professionals and older patients cited a majority of items from the domain of vitality (i.e. 14 items cited by both professionals and patients). Moreover, community-dwelling elderly cited many items in the psychosocial field (i.e. 8 items) while nursing home residents did not (i.e. 1 item). Professionals also place a lot of importance on locomotion (i.e. 13 items). Conclusion: The items identified both by the Delphi approach and the focus groups could be interesting to develop a frailty specific Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO).",

This study aimed to test the relationship between the level of serum Klotho and mortality among a specific population of nursing home residents. Methods: We followed subjects of the SENIOR study, a cohort of nursing home residents in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, during 24 months, for the occurrence of death. In this population, a Klotho was measured at baseline to assess the relationship between the level of serum Klotho and survival. The IBL ELISA kit was used to measure soluble a Klotho protein in blood. The subjects were categorized in 3 groups according to the lower, middle and upper tertiles of serum Klotho. Results: Among residents followed for 2 years, a klotho dosages was available for 415 subjects. The mean age of these subjects was 82.9 \u00b1 9.24 years and 332 (74.8%) of them were women. Deceased subjects had a baseline serum klotho level of 487.6 (385.9-599.4) pg/ mL and still alive subjects had a level of 510.2 (394.7-622.7) pg/mL (p = 0.32). The number of deaths observed during the follow-up wasn't significantly different according to the tertiles (p = 0.72). At last, after adjustment on age and sex, the survival time wasn't different according to the tertiles (p = 0.38).

Purpose: To assess the literature and perform a meta-analysis of the association between sarcopenia with falls and fractures among older adults. Data sources: A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and CINAHL from inception to May 2017. Study Selection: Published in English, mean/median age C 65 years, sarcopenia diagnosis, falls and/or fractures outcomes, any study population. Data Extraction: Pooled analysis was conducted of the association of sarcopenia, falls and fractures, expressed in odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed by study design, population, sex, sarcopenia definition, continent and study quality. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistics. Data Synthesis: The search identified 2511 studies. Thirty-one studies (43962 individuals) were included in the systematic review. Three studies reported both outcomes falls and fractures. Twelve out of 19 studies reported a significantly higher risk of falls in sarcopenic compared to non-sarcopenic individuals; 12 out of 15 studies showed a significant association with fractures. Twenty-five studies (34117 individuals) were included in the meta-analysis. Sarcopenic individuals had a significant higher risk of falls (OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.61-2.05) and fractures (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.47-2.03) compared to non-sarcopenic individuals. This was independent of study design, population, sex, sarcopenia definition, continent and study quality. Limitations: Results were expressed as crude or adjusted ORs with varying adjustments. Conclusions: A strong and consistent association between sarcopenia with falls and fractures in older adults strengthens the need to invest in sarcopenia prevention and interventions to evaluate its effect on falls and fractures.",

Protein intake at breakfast is often low and therefore breakfast offers the potential for protein suppletion. Since protein is known for its satiating effects, we explored the association between the amount of protein intake at breakfast and total daily protein intake in older adults. Methods: Baseline protein intake was assessed by a 3-day dietary record in 507 community dwelling older adults of 55 years and older participating in lifestyle interventions at the Amsterdam Nutritional Assessment Center. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between protein intake at breakfast (in g) and total daily protein intake (in g, and g/kg body weight), adjusted for energy intake (kcal/d), sex, age and BMI. Interactions were tested for sex, age and BMI but were not significant (p [ 0.80). Results: Mean age was 67.6 \u00b1 (SD) 7.3 years, 42% was female, and mean BMI was 30.0 \u00b1 5.6 kg/m 2 . Total daily protein intake was 81 \u00b1 24 g which equals 0.96 \u00b1 0.3 g/kg and 17.6 \u00b1 3.7 percent of total energy intake. Protein intake at breakfast was 14 \u00b1 7 g.

We evaluated the prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with functional and clinical status in a population of healthy ambulatory subjects over 45 years living at home, in Paris (France). Methods: This study was conducted selecting all ambulatory participants (n = 1445) aged 45 years and older from October 2008 to September 2011, consulting in the Institute of Physiology (Institut de Jaeger) from Paris (France) for a functional and muscular evaluation, and did not have limitations to moderate physical exercise. All were healthy people. All subjects performed a medical examination, associated with evaluation of muscle mass (body composition assessment using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and of muscle function (by hand grip strength). Diagnosis of sarcopenia required the documentation of low muscle mass with low muscle strength according to the current international consensus definition of sarcopenia. Results: From 1421 participants (553 males and 868 females) definitively enrolled, 221 subjects (135 females and 86 males) (15.5%) were identified as sarcopenic. Results from multivariate logistic regression models showed that sarcopenia was inversely associated with BMI with those participants with BMI higher than 22 kg/m 2 showing a lower risk of sarcopenia relative to those with BMI less than 21 kg/m 2 (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60-0.91). Similarly, probability of sarcopenia was lower among subjects involved in leisure physical activities for 3 h or more per week (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24-0.93). According to the category of age [45-54; 55-64; 65-74; 75-84 and 85 years or more], the prevalence of sarcopenia in women increase from 9. 1; 12.7; 14.5; 19.4 ; to 33.3%, respectively. For the men, the percentage of sarcopenia increase with aging from 8.6; 15.6; 13.6; 63.8 to 45.5%, respectively. Conclusions: The present study suggests that among healthy ambulatory subjects over 45 years living at home, sarcopenia is frequent, even to the youngest subjects of the studied population, taking place from 9% from 45 years, until 64.3% for the subjects over 85 years. Our findings support the hypothesis that muscle mass and function are associated with BMI and physical activity, whatever the age of the subject.",

This study investigated the relationship between physical function and depressive symptoms by weight status in older US adults. Methods: Cross-sectional data were analysed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey waves 2011-2012 and 2013-2014. Physical function was assessed using a grip strength dynamometer. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the selfreported Patient Health Questionnaire-9.

Teriparatide (parathyroid hormone, PTH) is a bone anabolic agent [1] and whole body vibration exercise (WBV) has been shown to decrease the rate of falls [2] . The purpose of this assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the effects of WBV + PTH vs PTH on physical function in osteoporotic women. Methods: This is a secondary analysis from a RCT with change in bone mineral density from baseline to 12 months as primary outcome yet to be obtained. Outcomes were short physical performance battery (SPPB; walking-speed, tandem balance-, five-times-sit-to-stand test), timed-upand-go (TUG), leg extension power, and handgrip strength at baseline, 3-, and 6 months of follow-up. Participants received teriparatide 20 lg/day and WBV were performed three times per week. The analyses were performed with intention-to-treat and mixed linear regression. Results: A total of 35 postmenopausal women (mean age 69 \u00b1 7) were randomized to WBV + PTH (n = 17) or PTH (n = 18). After 6 months, 91.4% completed follow-up. SPPB improved from baseline to 3 months (p = 0.039) in the WBV + PTH compared to the PTH with a non-significant change at 6 months (median [IQR] 9 [7.5-10.5], 11 [9-12] , and 10 [8-12] (WBV + PTH) vs 10 [10-12], 10 [10-12], and 10 [9-12] (PTH)). No differences between groups were observed for leg extension power, TUG, or handgrip strength. Conclusion: Adding WBV to PTH yields a significant improvement in physical performance after the first 3 months. This suggests that employing WBV to those undergoing PTH-treatment could have an added benefit to its direct effects on bone by improving physical function. Introduction: Sarcopenia is used in older people to describe reduction in skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength. Blood pressure (BP) is directly and causally related to body size in the general population. It remains uncertain whether muscle mass is an important factor in determining blood pressure. The purpose of our study; the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure changes in sarkopenic aged patients are different from those in non-sarcopenic patients. Method: Forty-two patients aged between 63 and 94 who applied to the geriatric clinic were included in the study. Demographic data and laboratory values of the patients were recorded. Blood pressure measurements were made with a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure meter. Muscle strength was assessed by handgrip test, muscle performance by 4-m walking test. Skeletal muscle mass was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Result: The patients were divided into two groups, 16 sarcopenic and 34 non-sarcopenic patients with a mean age of 78.22 \u00b1 6.80. In sarcopenic group, daytime systolic blood pressures were found to be significantly lower than in non-sarcopenic group. Muscle mass (muscle mass assessed by BIA alone, without hand strength and walking speed) and ambulatory blood pressure data were assessed by Pearlson correlation analysis. There was statistically significant and negative correlation between muscle mass and blood pressure change. Key conclusion: When antihypertensive treatment is given in the patients with sarcopenia, it should be considered that there may be decrease in systolic blood pressure and the dose should be titrated by starting the treatment at low doses and monitoring the blood pressure closely.",

Jonsson 1 1 University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland Introduction: Associations between obesity, physical function and falls in old adults are not clear. Obesity is defined using body mass index (BMI), which does not discriminate between body fat and muscle mass. More sophisticated measurements of body composition might be better suited to explore associations between body composition and function. The aim was to investigate BMI and other anthropometric variables in relation to physical function and falls. Methods: Community dwelling subjects from Reykjavik, Iceland (N = 108, 78.3 \u00b1 6.4 years, 76% female) participated in this crosssectional study. Anthropometrics (bio-electrical-impedance), grip strength, Short-Physical-Performance-Battery (SPPB), gait speed (400 m) and number of falls during the last 12 months were assessed. Results: Neither overweight (40.2%) nor obesity (35.3%) were associated with SPPB, gait speed or falls but with higher grip strength (5.2 \u00b1 2.2 kg, P = 0.021 and 5.6 \u00b1 2.3 kg, P = 0.021, respectively) when compared to normal weight (24.3%). BMI correlated significantly with indices of muscle mass (r = 0.4-0.7) and fat mass (r = 0.5-0.9) in both sexes. Measurements of segmental muscle mass were associated with better SPPB, grip strength and gait speed, corresponding measurements of body fat were associated with poorer function. No anthropometric variable was independently associated with number of falls. Key conclusions: Obesity defined by BMI is not related to strength but not to physical function in old adults. A possible explanation is that BMI is both related to fat and muscle mass. A segmental analysis of body composition shows that muscle and fat are related to physical function in the expected way. However, body composition is not related to falls in old Icelandic adults.",

Furthermore, having fallen once increases the risk of falling again. This study explored the perspectives of older persons experiencing a recent fall and how the fall affected everyday life. Methods: A phenomenological-hermeneutical approach was used together with a qualitative explorative design. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed by systematic text condensation. Data was managed in NVIVO. Results: A total of nine patients (five women, four men) attending a Danish Falls Clinic were included. Median [IQR] age was 78 [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] years. The analysis provided four themes: ''Importance of getting professional help'', ''Maintaining meaningfulness in everyday life'', ''Help supplies'', and ''The silent patient''. The analysis emphasized that wishes and needs varied depending on what the older person found most meaningful in life. However, all patients expressed a wish not to fall again. Some patients expressed specific requests for help supplies, which tended to be more frequent among women. Whereas, ''silent patients'' rejected or didn't express any specific needs or wishes related to their fall. Key conclusions: This study provides knowledge about the differences in older person's wishes and needs after a fall, which highlights the importance of person-centered treatment of older fallers. The expression of no needs could represent a lack of knowledge or a social and cultural norm, where need for help is considered as a threat to the personal identity. This indicates that there might be reasons for providing better information in the society about fall prevention. Keywords: Health promotion, Prevention in vulnerable population",

Frailty indexes (FI) and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) are multidimensional tools. FIs serve as quantitatively measure for frailty levels. They have excellent correlation with mortality, however aren't used in routine clinical practice. Objectives: Analyze frailty degree in patients admitted at our Geriatric Unit and assess how it influences their functional situation and correlation with mortality at 6 months after discharge from hospital. Methods: Retrospective, cross-sectional and descriptive study of a patient cohort admitted at an Acute Geriatric Unit from April to September 2017. We carried out a 6 month follow up and analyzed visits to emergency room, new hospital admissions, functional status and mortality. Statistical analysis was carried out with IBM SPSS. Results: We included 160 patients, with an average age of 84.6 years and 62% were female. Respiratory infections were the main reason for admission (32.5%). About 70% of patients came from the emergency service, 69% of them with severe dependence and 28% died during hospital stay. The average Frailty-CGA Index was 0.45, having 48% of patients a moderate frailty. After 6 months 64% of patients went at the emergency room at least once and 17.8% of them died, of which 47% had a moderate frailty and 43% an advanced frailty. Conclusions: Frailty assessment offers professionals a simple analysis to determine patient's reserve, vulnerability and situational diagnosis; it's crucial to establish therapeutic intensity intervention and measure efficacy afterwards. Frailty quantification methodizing will provide a framework in the interdisciplinary geriatric care teams.",

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 3 service providers and 16 clients and thematically analysed data. Findings: Interview data suggest that COM-B can be used to support behaviour change in mild frailty. Clients were able to identify a range of assets to improve/maintain. Project workers successfully worked with older people to assess their capability, opportunity and motivation to meet outcome goals, helped them develop related behavioural goals and work towards these. Most participants responded positively to this approach. However, further consideration needs to be made for people developing cognitive impairment, and the best approaches to support behaviour change in this group.",

Methods This study was conducted selecting all ambulatory participants aged 45 years and older, consulting in the Institute of Physiology from Paris, for a functional, muscle and bone mineral density evaluation, and did not have limitations to moderate physical exercise. All were healthy people. Lombar, femoral bone mineral density and muscle body composition were measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Skeletal muscle mass index and handgrip strength were used for sarcopenia diagnosis. Independent samples t tests determined group differences in body composition and functional ability according to recommended diagnostic cut points. Results: From 1409 participants definitively enrolled, prevalence of sarcopenia was 16.1% (135 females and 86 males) according to the EWGSOP definition. The prevalence of osteopenia in the cohort was 33.5% and osteoporosis was 17.9%, according to the standard WHObased T-score criterion. From the age of 45 years, more than 10% of the sarcopenic population suffers from osteoporosis. Osteosarcopenia begins from 45 years and the risk increases with the advanced in age. Sarcopenia increased as BMD decreased as follows: normal BMD: 5.7%, osteopenia 27.1%, and osteoporosis 34.2% respectively. After adjustment for age and BMI, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) for sarcopenia was respectively 2.21 (1.36-4.28) for the osteopenic group, and 1.88 (1.15-3.84 ) for the osteoporotic group (p \\ 0.05). Using the WHO definition, the percentage of sarcopenic obesity was 35.6% of our sarcopenic female population, and 33.7% of the sarcopenic males.

            "text": "Screening for frailty in the specialist oncology setting This is predicted to rise to 23.7% by 2025 [1] . Advancement in cancer treatments means more older adults are undergoing therapy and this cohort is more likely to be frail. Frail patients are less likely to tolerate cancer treatments, but screening for frailty is not routinely performed in the oncology setting. Current practice is to evaluate patients for treatment based on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score; a tool not validated to assess for frailty. We looked at the correlation between PS and frailty screening tools. Methods: We evaluated in-patients aged [ 65 years across two wards at a specialist oncology center. Data was collected from electronic records and by undertaking the G8 frailty tool questionnaire. Results: 36 patients were included in the study (mean age 73 years). 83% of patients were frail. There was no significant correlation (Spearman's correlation p = 0.177) between age and G8 score. The area under the ROC curve of 0.39 comparing G8 with PS \\ 2 (not frail) and PS C 2 (frail) suggests that PS does not reflect the burden of frailty detected by the G8. Conclusion: Frailty is highly prevalent in older cancer patients. The ECOG PS score does not correlate to frailty. A more suitable frailty assessment tool should be used to identify those who are most at risk of treatment-related toxicity and cancer mortality. Aim: The prevalence of hyperkyphosis is rising among elderly individuals. In previous studies, it was associated with paraspinal muscle composition, spinal extensor muscle weakness, and impaired lower extremity physical function. The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between hyperkyphosis and structural and functional muscle deterioration due to aging. Methods: The study included 142 participants who applied to our university's geriatric outstanding clinic from January 2017 to January 2018. The kyphosis grade was measured using the block method, where the participants were told to lie in a supine position on a radiology table. Blocks with thickness of 1.7 cm were placed under their heads to keep participants' heads in neutral position. The block of one and above was considered as hyperkyphosis.",

We analyze 90 patients from the Falls Clinic of the Geriatrics Service. Participants walked first in ''SPEED-AGE'' and later in GAITRite, and gait speed test of SPPB. The GAITRite protocol of the Falls Clinic includes two measurements at usual pace, one at speed fast, one slow and one with dual-task. For the validation we use the walk to usual pace and the average of these 5 measurements of GAITRite. The association between gait speed determinations was performed by correlation analysis of Pearson, the Bland-Altman method and finally t-test was used to paired samples to quantify the differences between methods. Seventeen patients had some fall in the next six months, with a decrease from 3.3/year to 0.6/6 months (95% CI 19-3.5). The adherence to exercise was 75%.",

We aimed to assess age-and gender-specific values of the HGS based on the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 7th and identify cut-off points for low muscle strength of HGS of Korean elderly. Methods: 5253 from the age of 20-80 years were subjected to measurements of HGS, including 2489 men and 2764 women. HGS was evaluated in both the dominant and non-dominant arm using the Digital hand dynamometer. HGS measurements were repeated three times, respectively and the greatest value was recorded. The cut-off value for low HGS was defined as below 2 SD values of healthy young adults in this study population. Results: The mean maximum HGS was increased from the age of 20-39 years. The peak in maximum HGS was in the age of 30-39 years range for both men and women. It was then decreased after 39 years. The cut-off values of low HGS for sarcopenia in male and female elderly populations were 29.6 and 16.5 kg, respectively. The prevalence of low HGS for sarcopenia was 25.7% in elderly men and 17.3% in elderly women respectively, and significantly increased with aging. Key conclusion: These data suggest useful reference values to assess HGS and may help in defining sarcopenia among the Korean population.",

This is a monocentric retrospective study with prospective data collection. All patients seen between 1995 to 2011 were included. For data analysis for quantitative variables, we used the student test or the Pearson correlation test. For qualitative variables to analysis of variance according to a Fischer test. 1179 patients benefited from a multidisciplinary consultation of the fall between 1995 and 2011. Of the patients interviewed, 205 patients (17%) were type 2 diabetics. Among the significant differences identified between groups: diabetic consultants were on average younger, had a lower level of education, a lower ADL, a higher body mass index. The fear of falling was more often expressed by diabetics than non-diabetics and was accompanied by a greater restriction of leaving their homes. Diabetic patients consumed significantly more drugs and the high polypharmacy was almost twice as common in diabetics as in non-diabetics. Our study suggests that diabetics experience falling earlier in life. Once identified the subject at high risk of falling, appropriate care must be offered to reduce the risk of falls. For this, we can, with benefit, appeal to the geriatrician, an expert in this area.",

Several variables, e.g., nutrition, physical activity (PA), body composition, hematological variables, medication and cognitive function have been associated with physical function among older adults. However, findings from studies have been inconsistent and it is still unclear which factors are independent predictors of physical function. We conducted a cross-sectional study including 236 community-dwelling old people (age range: 65-92 years, 58.2% female) in Reykjavik, Iceland. Timed-up-and-go (TUG), 6-minutes-walk-for distance (6MWD), nutrition, PA, body composition, blood chemical variables, medication and cognitive function were assessed.

This work intends to describe the frailty profiles in younger and older HF patients. Methods: Patients were recruited from an outpatient clinic in a University Hospital in Portugal. New York Heart Association (NYHA) HF classes were registered. Frailty was assessed using Fried phenotype. Mid-arm muscular circumference (MAMC) was estimated from mid-acromial-radial circumference and triceps skinfold. Results: Overall 86 patients were included: age 57 \u00b1 13 (24-81 years), 66% men, 34% older than 65 years. Regarding NYHA class, 30, 53 and 17% were respectively at class I, II and III. Overall, 58% were pre-frail and 14% frail. Frailty was more frequent among NYHA III patients (p \\ 0.001) and in men at the lowest MAMC tertile (p \\ 0.001). While frailty was more prevalent at older ages (58%, p \\ 0.05), 54% and 9% of younger patients were pre-frail and frail, respectively. Exhaustion (37%), low physical activity (35%) and weakness (35%) were the most frequent overall criteria (and for those aged \\ 65), whereas among older patients, weakness was the most determinant criterion (62% vs. 21%, p \\ 0.001). NYHA classification was not associated with age. Conclusions: As expected, frailty in HF patients is associated with older age and more severe NYHA class. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of younger patients are frail/pre-frail and this syndrome shows different profiles between ages.

The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of frailty of elderly residents living with long-term care, to identify associated S112 Eur Geriatr Med (2018) 9 (Suppl 1):S1-S367 factors and to propose effective interventions to prevent the loss of autonomy. Materials and methods: This is a descriptive and analytical study in January 2017 in an EHPAD in Tunisia. Fragility data were collected using a pre-established questionnaire on resident social data, the EGS using screening scales, and the frailty level by the SEGA-A score. According to this score, patients were classified into 2 groups according to their degree of fragility: not fragile, versus fragile and very fragile.",

Daily pain is prevalent among frail subjects but its role in sarcopenia and osteosarcopenia has not been fully investigated. Methods: We enrolled 70 subjects community-dwellers aged C 70 (40 sarcopenics, 30 osteosarcopenics). Sarcopenia was determined by DXA (FNIH criteria); osteosarcopenia was defined as the presence of sarcopenia and osteoporosis (T-Score B -2.5). To assess frailty we used SPPB (3 B x B 9) and hand-grip strength (\\ 30 kg men, \\ 20 kg women) and sites, duration and level of pain was investigated by NRS. Results: All osteosarcopenics (OS) and 85% of sarcopenics (S) reported pain. Greater, but not statistically significant, intensive pain (NRS = 7.12 \u00b1 0.33) was observed in S than in OS (NRS = 6.7 \u00b1 0.31), (p = 0.18). No significant difference was found in number of sites between S (2.94 \u00b1 0.36) and OS (3.07 \u00b1 0.33), (p = 0.4). Osteosarcopenics were more likely to have prolonged pain (C 1 year) (78%) than S (58%), (p = 0.09). In OS, stratified by muscle-strength, NRS was significantly different (NRS = 7.33 \u00b1 0.45 weak vs NRS = 6.07 \u00b1 0.37 no-weak, p = 0.02). A significant association emerges in S between NRS and gender: men had lower levels (NRS = 5.93 \u00b1 0.53) than women (NRS = 8.05 \u00b1 0:26), (p \\ 0.001). Conclusion: Prevalence and pain intensity were high in both groups, without difference regarding the number of seats.

Patients who are admitted to intermediate hospital have a high rate of multimorbidity and chronicity, which is difficult to measure, and correlate with mortality. Methods: Prospective observational study of patients entered LTC and CU of a Intermediate Hospital during the period September 2017 April 2018. To evaluate the degree of frailty of patients whom are admitted at a long-term care (LTCU) and convalescence (CU) unit by using a new tool: Index fragil-VGI*, based on several items of the integral geriatric evaluation as well as its relationship with the diagnoses of admission and unit in which they are admitted. Family interview, the frailty questionnaire ''fragile-VGI index'' is applied, asking the patient's previous status (1 month before the current event), recording the data obtained in an Excel database. Results: We included 274 patients, 149 at the LTCU (58.18%) and 125 (41.81%) al CU. In the LTCU the average frailty index was severe (0.56) and at the CU was mild fragility (0.26). The diagnosis of dementia and/or delirium is the most related with moderate frailty. Trauma patients obtained mild frailty. Conclusions: AT the LTCU the sever frailty is more common, related to more elderly patients. The mild frailty index confirms the objective of enhancing autonomy and a need of personalized medicine. Planning a one-year follow-up in order to establish association between frailty index and mortality/number of hospital admissions. Introduction: Identify frail older adults in primary care is crucial to developed a geriatric care plan to prevent adverse outcomes. Frailty phenotype is considered a gold standard to recognize this geriatric syndrome and included five dimension: unintentional weight loss, hand grip strength (HGS), weakness, exhaustion, slow gait and low physical activity. Different cut-off has been propose to use in the HGS. Aim: Analyze the influence of three different HGS cut-offs in the prevalence of robust, pre-frail and frail older adults in primary care. Methods: A quantitative, observational and correlational study was conducted. It was developed in primary health care. The non-random sampling of convenience constituted by 136 older adults. Fragility was assessed using the phenotypic approach. For the dimension HGS, three cut-offs values (A, B, and C) were tested: A: \\ 18 kg (women) and \\ 31 kg (man); B: \\ 20 kg (women) and \\ 30 kg (man); C: \\ 16 kg (women) and \\ 26 kg (man). Results: Seventy (51.5%) of participants was women, the mean age average was 74 \u00b1 6.2 years and more than a half report a good selfassessment of health (? %). The prevalence of robust, pre-frail and frail older adults was similar between the cut-off A and B, 18.4% vs 17.1%, 55.1% vs 54.8% and 26.5% vs 38.1%, respectively. With cutoff C less older adults was considered frail (19.3%) and more are classified was per-frail (60%) and robust (20.7%). Conclusion: There is no universal consensus about the best HGS cutoff value. However, this single dimension in the frailty phenotype have a significant role in the percentage of frailty in primary care and should be considered according to the purpose of the study or intervention.",

Studies have found that it increases morbidity and mortality. Approximately one in three older adults falls each year. Mild-chronic hyponatremia may predispose to falls and fractures which lead to dependency. Frailty status is a risk factor of S118 Eur Geriatr Med (2018) 9 (Suppl 1):S1-S367 dependency. Little is known of the association between mild-chronic hyponatremia at Emergency Department (ED), fall prevalence and frailty status in elderly. Therefore we are investigating the link between frailty status, mild-chronic hyponatremia and risk of falls in nursing home patients admitted to MUPA Unit. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study during four months including patients older than 75 years living in nursing home, admitted to MUPA Unit (Limoges CHU, France). Socio-demographic factors, falls event, Comorbidities, Medications, sodium levels were studied (hyponatremia was considered Na+ \\136 mmol/l) and the short-CGA variables including the frailty score SEGA : not frail (SEGA B 8), frail (8\\SEGA B 11) and very frail (SEGA[11) status. Results: Of 132 cases recruited, the mean age was 89 \u00b1 5.2 and 72.2% were women. The prevalence of mild-chronic hyponatremia was 16.7% and the prevalence of falls was 25% in frail group. The prevalence of mild-chronic hyponatremia was 11.7% and the prevalence of falls was 18% in the group of very frail patients. Conclusion: Given that mild-chronic hyponatremia could be considered a risk factor for falls, the inclusion of the determination of sodium level at ED would be an indicator of frailty status of elderly admitted to MUPA Unit.",

Methods: A 10 items' screening scale investigating social isolation, physical and surroundings' negligence, inappropriate behavior, weight loss, iterative hospitalizations, falls, activities' reduction, sensory deficiency, unsuitable housing and polymedication was administered in 591 people (80.1 \u00b1 5.4 years old, 58% women) in primary health care settings.

Whereas this first group could be considered as ''normal'' (68.9%), three other clinical profiles were highlighted, a ''physical frailty'' profile (12.7%) mostly presenting falls and weight loss, a ''social/cognitive/affective frailty'' profile (14.7%), by merging 2 groups derived from the multicomponent analysis and a ''hospitalizations'' profile (3.7%), suggesting a rather established physical frailty status. Key conclusions: Further validation studies are required.

Our study aimed at investigating the relationship between mortality and renal function as estimated by glomerular filtration rate formulas (eGFR) in the orthogeriatric setting, where frailty and sarcopenia are highly prevalent. Methods: This is a prospective study carried out in the Orthogeriatric Unit of Careggi Hospital, including 569 consecutive patients aged 65 or older, with bone fractures requiring surgical treatment. Serum creatinine and cystatin C were determined at admission and GFR was estimated according to different formulas (CKD-EPIcr, CKD-EPIcr-cysC, CKD-EPIcysC, BIS-1, BIS-2). Mortality was analyzed using data from regional registers. Results: The study population had a mean age of 82.7 \u00b1 8.2 years (77% female). The 75% was admitted for hip fracture. At admission mean serum creatinine and cystatin C were 0.93 mg/dL and 1.48 mg/ dL, respectively. During a 4.5-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was 42.7% (n = 243 patients). A preliminary analysis using Kaplan-Meier plots showed that participants with CKD-EPIcr eGFR [ 80 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 had higher mortality than those with CKD-EPIcr eGFR 60-79 mL/min all over the follow-up duration. At approximately 2 years of follow-up, the curves referring to eGFR [ 80 mL/min/m 2 and eGFR \\ 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 overlapped. Key conclusions: All-cause mortality was similar in patients with eGFR [ 80 mL/min/m 2 and eGFR \\ 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , after 2 years of follow-up. These data suggest that higher eGFRs probably result from low serum creatinine in patients with sarcopenia. Cystatin C may be a useful alternative renal marker, in the orthogeriatric setting.",

We performed a meta-analysis of eight cohort studies comprising 161,081 older adults. This showed that for older people with frailty, lower blood pressure was associated with higher mortality. However, a systematic review of two randomised control trials measuring frailty showed that low blood pressure reduced mortality. We also report the findings of 20 qualitative interviews exploring factors influencing blood pressure treatment in later life with older people themselves. These findings demonstrate different representations of frailty: in the trial and observational literature; between physicians and older people themselves; and between older people with one another.

The frequency of chronic comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM) can be seen more in frail elderly than not. There is a new area of interest in the literature in studies of the relationship between frailty and insulin resistance and DM. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between HbA1c-variability and frailty. Methods: In a period of one year,452 elderly patients whose frailty status were known were included for the study. All patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment. Frailty status of the patients was evaluated by Fried Frailty Scale and grouped as frail, pre-frail and robust. 151(33.4%) of the patients had DM. The retrospective HbA1c values of these patients were reached. The relationship between frailty and HbA1c variability was evaluated in 76 patients with at least three HbA1c measurements. The following parameters were calculated for HbA1c variability: HbA1c mean (HbA1c-M), HbA1c standard deviation (HbA1c-SD) and HbA1c variation coefficient (HbA1c-VC). Results: The mean age of the patients was 76 \u00b1 6 years and 46 (60.5%) patients were female. The most frequent concomitant comorbidity was hypertension with 86.8%. The rate of frail patients was 19.7%. Median HbA1c-M [7.93 (min-max: 6.61-9.60) vs 6.92 (min-max: 5.68-11.40)], median HbA1c-SD [0.93 (min-max: 0.19-2.69) vs. 0.58 (min-max: 0.17-2.69)] and median HbA1c-VC [0.13 (min-max: 0.03-0.36) vs. 0.09 (min-max: 0.03-0.36)] were found to be significantly higher in frail patients than in non-frail patients(p = 0.010, p = 0.016, p = 0.026, respectively).

We aimed to elucidate in detail the role of OPG as a marker of mortality and CV risk in elder subjects suffered from heart failure. Therefore, we explored the possible link between OPG, sarcopenia and malnutrition. This is a cohort, multicentre study. Elder patients ([ 65 years) were collected and followed up for 3 years.

It is also known that such subjects take on average at least five or more active ingredients per day, with the risk of drug interactions and adverse reactions (remembering that the aging process is accompanied by pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic modifications able to modify the risk ratio-benefication of pharmacological treatment). Recent studies show that inadequate prescriptions in the elderly subject, poor therapeutic adherence (46%), cognitive impairment, fragility and rehospitalization can significantly and negatively influence the quality of life and the state of health. Therefore, the possibility of suspending an inappropriate active substance (deprescribing), in order to reduce the risks compared to the expected benefits, is still the subject of studies of international interest. In this perspective the integration between medical specialists Geriatrics/Internists/Pharmacologists, hospital/outpatient and local physicians specialists plays a fundamental role in the preparation of individual-personalized therapeutic pathways.

The Tunisian Geriatric Association (ATG) in Collaboration with MEAMA has launched the first intensive postgraduate course in geriatric medicine stimulating interest and knowledge in geriatrics. The course is made of 4 sessions, that last 2 days each and will be finished within a year. The course is geared toward physicians mainly internists and family physicians. The topics of the four sessions will cover the major issues of geriatrics practice and issues including First session: metabolic disorders Second session: osteoporosis, Vitamin D, Falls Assessment and Prevention, rehabilitation, sarcopenia.

Typical events provided practical advice on managing older patients and sessions designed to overcome negative perceptions of the specialty. Registration, advertising and feedback were co-ordinated through AEME's website. Social media was used for promotion. The events were free to attend through sponsorship, voluntary speakers and free venues. Results: Since 2014 there have been 21 G4 J Connect events in 15 UK cities. Mean number of delegates attending each is 49 (range 25-109). Modal event length is 3 h (range 2.5-6.5 h). Events typically took place in the evening in a city centre hospital. Feedback from delegates has been consistently positive, including decisions made to pursue a career in geriatrics following attendance.

Social media and technology could increase efficiency and optimise patient care however we are concerned that guidance around the topic is not clear. Methods: Anonymous polls used to question doctors and medical students. Questions included using messenger services to discuss patient care, send photographs to acquire advice and use social media to share cases for education. Finally, we asked about exposure to professional guidance and teaching on the topic. Results: There were 150 respondents, 57% of which were aware of existing professional guidance and 38% had received formal education on the topic. 45% thought it acceptable to send an ECG and 30% a photo of a body part, to a colleague for the purpose of gaining advice. 56% would share an anonymized X-ray on Facebook for educational purposes and 13% use WhatsApp to handover patients. 11% of those questioned admitted that they don't always act appropriately on social media. There was limited variation across the grades. Conclusions: Despite guidance from the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association, the Medical Defence Union and the Royal Colleges of Physicians, practice is variable. There remains uncertainty on the appropriate use of social media and technology in the workplace potentially leaving clinicians vulnerable to criticism and prosecution. A national consensus should be reached on how to embrace technology to help improve education and aid patient care whilst avoiding governance issues.",

The forgotten anxieties of childhood, the unresolved conflicts of adolescence, the uncertainties along all the life-span are expressed in old age that also confronts the possible emerging issues related to age. The aim of this study was to know the most frequent fears in elderly women. Methods: A pilot sample of 30 women, aged 60-79 years, living in Milan, who reported to be in good psychophysical health, belonging to a cultural club, participated in the investigation. An interview, which was designed for the study, was administered together with the participants completing a measure of anxiety (SAS) and of depression (GDS). Results: The average age of the sample was 68.75 years. The majority had a tertiary level of education. The main fears were: dementia, loss of control, loneliness, existential void, difficulty cooping, disability, assaults, unforeseen events, pain and depression. The interviewees were concerned above all else that their worries will increase in the future; with respect to overall worries, they report that men are more afraid than women, older people are more worried than younger people, and immigrants more than the locals. They wanted ''fearful'' people to be helped and understood. The SAS and the GDS were in the normal range for all participants. Conclusion: The women expressed that they have fears linked to the years to come, but despite this they had a positive attitude to deal with these worries.",

CAM modalities are often used as self-care to enhance well-being, to support medical treatments, to prevent and to cure illnesses. Many herbal and biologic preparations offer promise, but they are largely of unproven benefit. The aim of this literature review was to investigate the use of CAM among older adults in Turkey. Methods: This literature search was carried out, using MEDLINE, PubMed, AMED, EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Turkish ULAKB\u0130M EKUAL databases. Key words included ''complementary and alternative medicines'', ''complementary and alternative therapies''; ''elderly'', ''older adults'', ''Turkey''. Results: In studies carried out on Turkish older adults, the rate of CAM use was varying from 54% and 59%. The most frequently used CAM therapies were use of herbal products (range 55.2-62.1%) and non-herbal supplements (range 43-53.5%). Other mainly used CAM types included prayer, exercise, massage, music, and thermal spring. Common reasons for use included improving physical and emotional well-being, protecting from disease, increasing immunity, relieving pain, praise, supporting medical treatments. Most of the older adults who used CAM methods believed that herbal products were not harmful, and they did not need to discuss these with their healthcare providers. Conclusions: According to the results of limited studies, CAM modalities have been frequently used by older adults in Turkey, but they generally do not inform healthcare providers that they have used these methods. Healthcare providers should give information and assist to older adults to choose CAM modalities safely and appropriately.",

A model of care was developed that retains the benefits of access and continuity that primary care provides, whilst also providing time for a more comprehensive assessment and specialist input. In addition, an opportunity is provided for trainees from different specialties to work together, facilitating joint working and learning. Methods: We developed a pilot joint clinic model, in which a Geriatric Specialist Trainee and GP ran a specialist geriatric clinic within primary care. Suitable patients with complex geriatric need were identified by GP colleagues and referred into the joint clinic. Clinic appointments were extended to 30 min to enable comprehensive geriatric assessment. Patient management plans were fed back to referring clinicians in the practice to enable whole practice learning. Results: We completed 4 clinics in 2 pairs of clinicians and saw 35 patients with an average age of 78. Common themes included cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, poly-pharmacy and movement disorders. Evaluation was by qualitative structured interview with Geriatric Trainee, GP and Consultant supervisor. The feedback demonstrated learning in clinical knowledge, service structure and collaborative approaches to patient care. Key conclusions: The themes of learning from the structured interviews in this pilot study mirrored the learning in the Paediatric model, which had demonstrated a cost effectiveness and quantitative improvement in healthcare. This pilot project therefore provides an exciting template to improve both training of GPs and Geriatricians, facilitating closer working between primary and secondary care.",

Some feelings towards older people seem negative during group discussions. Few studies have already been conducted to evaluate the effect of ''aging game'', on attitudes, empathy and knowledge towards elderly. We led this pilot study to make students aware of physiological changes, and to improve their empathy towards elderly. Methods: Intervention-based pilot study led in a geriatric hospital, to medical student, during an internship in a geriatric ward. They filled self-report questionnaires including sociodemographic data, basic knowledge in geriatrics, empathy and attitude towards the elderly before and after experiencing aging game. Data were analyzed using McNemar test, paired sample student test and Wilcoxon test.",

The analysis of modification about knowledge, attitude and empathy is still in progress. Introduction: The management of diabetes in adults with cognitive dysfunction presents many challenges for patients, caregivers, and medical providers. It is important to be aware of the complexity of daily self-care tasks required of people living with diabetes and to recognize the ways in which cognitive impairment can interfere with these tasks. A team approach involving the patient, family, and caregivers and including the use of allied health professionals and assistive devices, as well as simplification of medication regimens with a focus on avoiding hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia, is needed for adults with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment. Currently only 10% of Diabetic Patient with Cognitive impairment attending Geriatric Clinic were assessed and advised regarding their medication management capacities and documented. This may lead to costly and life-threatening hypo or hyper-glycemic emergencies that will negatively impact the diabetic patient quality of life. A quality improvement project was carried out from September 2015 to December 2015.",

Therefore, in the presented study it was aimed to observe the effects of dual-task on static and dynamic balance and to present if static and dynamic balance training under dual-task performance effect the static and dynamic balance ability positively among the older adults having an institutional living. Methods: The study presented is a randomized controlled clinical study. Fifty volunteer individuals (72.02 \u00b1 6.60 years of age, ranging between 64 and 91; 12% female, n = 6, 88% male, n = 44) took part in this study. The assessments as Barthel Index (BI), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Berg Balance Scale Under Dual-Task Performance (BBS-DTP were performed. All volunteers were above 65 years old and living in the T.C Darulaceze Presidency. The participants were divided into two groups by computer-generated randomization table: Group A (n = 26, number of sessions = 5) and Group B (n = 24, number of sessions = 7). After static and dynamic balance training, given under dual-task performance, BBS and BBS-DTP scores were recorded again and compared with statistical analyzes both using the group and between the groups. Results: According to the outcomes, the balance score was not affected by dual-task performance, and no differences were found between groups (p [ 0.05). For both groups, the BBS score and the BBS-DTP score showed positive improvement after training sessions (p = 0.00). When sub-parameters were analyzed for BBS-DTP, Group B had more task significance compared to Group A. Due to BI classification of functional independence, both before and after training sessions, positive improvements were found for BBS and BBS-DTP scores (p = 0.00). Conclusion: Training had positive effects at every level of functional independence according to outcomes of BI. For both groups, significant progress was found in BBS and BBS-DTP scores, but not affected by the session numbers. Introduction: Recent literature shows that pain is a significant problem in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is associated with worse health status and lower exercise capacity. The relation between pain and physical activity is important, since lifelong adherence to physical activity is essential to improve HRQoL and prognosis in COPD. Not much is known about pain in in relation to acute exacerbations (AECOPD) and post-acute pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). The primary aim of the present study is to investigate prevalence and characteristics of pain in older patients with COPD hospitalized for AECOPD and indicated for post-acute PR. Secondary aim is to investigate the relationship between pain and other symptoms and between pain and functional status. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study included 149 patients (mean age 70.8 (\u00b1 7.9) years, 49% male, mean FEV1% predicted: 35.3 (\u00b1 12.6)). Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory.",

Methods: Longitudinal study including those patients that attended the GRDH for a minimum of seven sessions between January 2007 and December 2011. We registered the following variables at baseline and at the end of the rehabilitation program: sociodemographic variables, NHP questionnaire (global score and subareas), Barthel Index and Lawton Index for activities of daily living, Timed Up and Go and Tinetti for mobility, and Mini-Mental Folstein and GDS-Yesavage for mental status. We considered QoL improvement if a decrease of the NHP score occurred with an effect size of C 0.50. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Of the 139 patients included (mean age 75.6 \u00b1 13.0, 57.5% women), forty-seven experienced QoL improvement. In the bivariate analysis, being a woman and having attended a higher number of sessions were associated with an improvement of the QoL subarea emotion (p = 0.036) and social isolation (p = 0.019), respectively.

As this group is vulnerable to stressors, hospitalizations promote loss of function, of quality of life, of independence as well as a higher infection rate leading to readmissions. Internationally an effective reduction of readmission rates in this population was demonstrated administering nurse support of the Transitional Care Model (TCM). Goal: The primary objective of the trans-sectional intervention project TIGER for geriatric patients is the reduction of readmission rates. Secondary outcomes are the increase in functional health status, quality of life and wound healing, and a decrease of risk of malnutrition. Method: TIGER is an RCT, the control group receiving usual care. In the intervention group the geriatric patients and their care givers will be supported by special nurses according to TCM-called ''Pfadfinder''. The Pfadfinder contact the geriatric patients already in the hospital and accompany them over 12 months in the ambulatory setting, integrating different modules of support. The target number of participants is 400. Inclusion criteria are 70 years and older, cognitive status measured by MMSE C 22, living in the vicinity of B 50 km, membership in a specific health insurance; being discharged to home. The ''First patient in'' was randomized in April 2018. The project will continue till August 2020. Perspectives: The TIGER project addresses the current transitional health care gap in Germany in the geriatric hospital population. The presentation will address recruiting aspects and present data of included patients.",

We developed and implemented a GR program for older patients with significant functional decline after hospital admission because of CVD: 'the GR-cardio program'. Aim of the program is to restore functional capacity to such an extent that discharge back home is possible, improve quality of life and prevent hospital re-admissions. The primary goal of the present study is to investigate feasibility of the GR-cardio program. Methods: This is a real life observational study with a follow-up period of 6 months in patients admitted to the GR-cardio program. We collected data on patient-and disease characteristics and course of functional status and quality of life. Six month after discharge data on re-admissions and mortality were collected. Results: In total 58 patients (mean age 78.8 (\u00b1 9.8) years) were included in the study. Co-morbidities were frequent and functional status and quality of life were severely impaired on admission but showed clinically relevant improvement during the program. Eightythree percent of all patients were discharged back home after a mean length of stay 38 days. Key conclusions: This study indicates that GR for patients with CVD is feasible and can probably offer substantial benefits. More research is needed and should focus on (cost)-effectiveness of the program and identifying patient characteristics that can predict which older patients with CVD are most likely to benefit.",

Aim of the study was to determine established (age, sex, motor performance and depressive symptoms) and hitherto neglected determinants (pain) of FSE in geriatric patients after hip/pelvic fracture. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 40 patients (82.1 \u00b1 6.7 years) with hip/pelvic fracture without cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination: 28.3 \u00b1 1.1) were assessed for demographic data, FSE (Short Falls Efficacy Scale International), motor performance (Short Physical Performance Battery), depressive symptoms (Montgomery-\u00c5 sberg Depression Rating Scale), and pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, subscale pain). After univariate evaluation of correlations between FSE and established parameters, variables (p B .100) were included in a first multiple linear regression model with FSE as dependent variable. In a second model, the variable list has been extended by the parameter pain. The parameters were interpreted on the basis of significance (p B .05), standardized regression coefficients b, and determination coefficients R 2 . Results: In the first model, the included significant determinants motor performance (b = -.310, p = .034), age (b = .309, p = .032), and depressive symptoms (b = .358, p = .013) elucidated 39.4% of variance (R 2 = .394) for the FSE. In the second model, the parameters age (b = .317, p = .020) and pain (b = .338, p = .022) improved the explanation of variance up to 48.5% (R 2 = .485). The parameters motor performance (b = -.249, p = .072) and depressive symptoms (b = .227, p = .111) made no significant contribution.

Elderly people are at risk for a significant decrease in function during hospitalization. The return to their natural and familiar environment has a positive influence on rehabilitation pace and outcomes as long as they have supportive families and communities. Methods: In a survey conducted by the social work department, we examined the overall satisfaction from home-based rehabilitation program. Telephone interviews were conducted among elderly orthopedic patients. The questionnaire included: waiting times for the program, satisfaction from the rehabilitation services and unmet needs. Findings: The overall satisfaction from rehabilitation outcomes was high among most participants (73%). However, participants reported on a long waiting time (Mean = 4.58, SD = 4.67 days) from the hospital discharge date, and that was associated with lower satisfaction. Most participants reported they didn't receive nursing services (76%) and doctor visits (46%). Participants reported on gaps in the program like: accessibility at home, emotional difficulties, loneliness, lack of response to the needs of caregivers and long term follow-up. Conclusions: As the world's elderly population continues to grow, there is a need to establish guidelines and to promote a home-based rehabilitation ''basket'', suitable for patients' and families' needs that will allow reduction in hospitalization days and in medications. The challenge health professionals are facing today is how to define the home-based rehabilitation ''basket'' and how to have it approved and implemented by policy makers.",

Results from the FRAIL-BCN study Introduction: Cognitive impairment is associated with poorer functional outcomes (FO) in elderly undergoing rehabilitation; however its role on rehabilitation is controversial. Objectives: To assess the association between cognitive function and FO in older adults admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation unit after hip fracture or stroke. To evaluate differences on functional recovery prediction between Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Methods: Prospective cohort study with patients C 65 years old admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation unit after hip fracture or stroke. FO were: absolute functional gain [ 20(AFG, discharge or 6 monthsadmission Barthel index) and walking recovery (WR, discharge or 6 months-admission walking Barthel index item). The association was assessed with Relative Risk (RR, 95% CI). Analyses were then stratified for diagnosis at admission. The discriminative capacity of SDMT and MMSE was assessed by comparing their AUC. Results: 202 patients were included [mean age (SD) 83.4 (\u00b1 6.7) years, 70% female]. Patients with MMSE C 20 had a RR = 2.22 (95% CI 1.33-3.72) of AFG [ 20 at discharge, results remained stable at 6 months (RR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.15-2.52). These results were confirmed only for hip fracture patients (Discharge: RR = 3.74, 95% CI 1.30-10.72; 6 months: RR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.09-5.99). WR at discharge and after 6 months was not related with baseline cognitive function; these results were confirmed also after diagnosis stratification. Comparing SDMT and MMSE, there was no difference in their functional recovery prediction. Conclusion: WR was not affected by cognitive function in older patients admitted to a rehabilitation unit. Furthermore, the effectiveness of rehabilitation program is maintained over 6 months after discharge. Therefore, rehabilitation should be considered in all patients, independently from their cognitive status.",

In the general population of industrialized countries, the prevalence varies from 10 to 20% and increases with age, to more than 70% in the Nursing Home Residents. Two pathophysiological conditions are recognized: Slow Transit Constipation (SRT) characterized by prolonged transit time of stools through the colon and reduction of evacuations less than three per week, and Dyssynergic Defecation (DD) due to difficult or unsatisfactory expulsion of stool from the anorectum, that may result from a lack of coordination between abdominal muscles contraction and pelvic floor muscle relaxation. Literature data suggest an important role in rehabilitative therapy, ie anorectal biofeedback, especially in DD. In this study we have reported our data on the management of elderly patients in a geriatric clinic dedicated to the treatment of chronic constipation. From June 2012 to June 2017, 908 patients with constipation (mean age 61 \u00b1 2.7 years, M \u00b1 ES, 337 M, 571 F) have been evaluated according to the criteria of Rome III, the Bristol scale (constipation = stool type 1-3) and the Wexner scale (constipation = [ 5/30) . After exclusion of secondary constipation, hygienic/ dietary requirements have been suggested for all patients, and prescribed osmotic fibers and/or laxatives (lactulose, macrogol) therapy and short-term, on-demand irritable laxatives (senna, bisacodile).All patients were asked to keep a daily diary on stool characteristics and were re-evaluated after 1, 3, 12 months. Patients who did not report treatment benefits after 3 months were treated with second-level drugs (prucalopride and/or linaclodide) and subsequently re-evaluate through functional tests included intestinal transit time and anorectal manometry, and, if indicated, initiated for rehabilitation treatment.",

The effect of quality and intensity of treatment as well as important (age-related) characteristics on functional outcome and quality of life are poorly studied. As such, no clear evidence-based guidelines determining type, quality, or intensity of training during rehabilitation admission exist. Method: The study has a mixed-methods approach with a large inception cohort and qualitative data-collection from elderly care physicians, physical therapists, patients, and primary caregivers. Patients are included after hospital admission at Bronovo Hospital, the Hague, with a hip fracture. They will be followed-up at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months in the outpatient clinic or place of residence during home-visits.

Sum score of achieved performance levels (scores) and duration/movement time (s) tested at different performance levels (2) (3) (4) represented study outcomes derived from internal exergame data stream for 2 test conditions (unsupported vs. procedural support). Results: Unsupported training increased total score (p [ 0.002) as well as duration of task in level 3 (p [ 0.001) with a trend for level 2 (p = 0.09) and level 4 (p = 0.08), while procedural support did not further improve training gains compared to unsupported test (total score: p = 0.241; level 2: p \\ 0.001; level 3: p = 0.151).

The Discharge to Assess model examines ongoing care needs in the home to deliver a personalised support plan. This study aims to determine the impact of embedding HomeSafe to the multidisciplinary team of an acute elderly care unit. Methods: Retrospective study of consecutive discharges from a geriatric ward between 1st January and 20th May 2018. Tests of change started on 5th April 2018, integrating the community team onto the ward to improve communication and understanding of discharge to assess process, expedite assessment by community team and allow early contact with relatives. Results: We included 247 patients with a mean age of 85 years and female predominance (70%). Overall discharge rate increased from 25 to 57 patients per month. Median length of stay was 7 days, however, HomeSafe patients median LOS was 11 days. Seven-day readmission was reduced from baseline. The rate-limiting step identified was the capacity of HomeSafe to take on the volume of new referrals, which was shown to triple. Conclusions: Communication between hospital and community health professionals is integral for the success of a discharge to assess team. The service increased the number of ward discharges with no increase in readmission or mortality rates. More data is required to streamline and determine the impact of this service.",

Methods: Prospective observational study of a cohort of women with alcoholism admitted for rehabilitation of a fracture during the year 2017. We analyze Socio-demographic data and the cognitive, affective and nutritional situation and the hepatic function at admission to the unit. Results: During 2017, 168 patients (96 women) were admitted in our functional recovery unit. Six women, who were admitted for rehabilitation of a fracture (Hip fracture 2, pelvis fracture 2, vertebral fracture and rib fractures 1 and 5th metatarsal diaphyseal fracture 1 had a history of alcoholic dependence and recurrent falls. The average age was 74.3 years (63-83), 7.3 years younger than the mean of the unit. Three had university studies, and the 83.3% had a high economic level. Two patients had cognitive impairment and all had depressive symptomatology and had scheduled at least 2 psychodrugs. All patients had sings of malnutrition: Albumin mean 3.03 g/dL (2.6-3.4) , Prealbumin mean 15.6 mg/dl (11-18) and 83.3% had high Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), mean of 124 U/l (45-268). Conclusions: (1) Alcoholic dependence is a cause of repeated falls and, consequently, of fractures in the women. (2) Women with chronic alcoholism are younger than the average, have a high purchasing power and a higher level of education. (3) There's always a depressive symptoms, a high consumption of psychotropic drugs, malnutrition and liver involvement. Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects mainly the young woman, rarely the elderly clinical-biological characteristics in this population is important to know in order to avoid delayed diagnosis and therapeutic errors. Patients and methods: A retrospective descriptive study performed during a period of 17 years including patients with an age greater than or equal to 65 years were included in whom the diagnosis of LES was retained according to the criteria of the ARA. Results: Eight elderly patients had SLE among 97 lupus patients, including 3 men and 5 women (sex ratio H/F at 0.6).The average age was 69 years old. Extra-renal disease was frequently found with rheumatic disease in 6 patients (5 cases of arthritis, 2 cases of myalgia, one case of myositis and one case of isolated arthralgia). Mucocutaneous involvement was observed in 5 patients. It is detailed. Cardiac involvement was present in 4 patients, renal involvement was observed in 5 patients. Hematological involvement was observed in 5 patients. Seven patients had received corticosteroid treatment. The other treatments used are detailed. The treatment with synthetic antimalarials was stopped in a patient with the retinal toxicity that caused it. Discussion: Systemic lupus erythematosus is very rare after 65 years with an estimated frequency of 5% or less.

In practice, this more complex disease is associated with a broad spectrum of non motor symptoms (NMS). These are well recognised features of both early and advanced PD and have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Nevertheless, non-motor symptoms are often overlooked in clinical practice. The UK National guidelines suggest that clinicians in Movement Disorder clinics should ask about non motor symptoms at least once per year as part of a routine review. This survey looked at our service performance, as our participation in the National Parkinson's Disease Audit highlighted insufficient detection of NMS. Methods: After obtaining verbal consent, 50 patients were asked to complete a validated questionnaire of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease before their clinic appointment. Thirty questions covered 10 domains of non-motor symptoms frequently experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease. Results and discussion: The administration of a self-completed questionnaire significantly improved the rate of detection of NMS. The most common NMS were identified as excess salivation, gastrointestinal symptoms and sleep disturbances. Once symptoms were identified, appropriate interventions could be taken, depending on the individual case and problem. This survey had shown that simple intervention had improved detection rate as well as appropriate intervention and ultimately quality of care of older patients with PD.",

Low-dose methotrexate is a common alternative to systemic corticosteroids. However, there is little evidence about the safety of methotrexate, especially among patients with impaired renal function. Methods: We included older adults (C 70 years) diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid between 2006 and 2015 at a single university hospital in Sweden and treated with low-dose methotrexate. Data was collected in electronic medical records. Renal function was estimated with the CKD EPI equation for glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to estimate the risk of adverse outcomes during follow-up. Results: A total of 232 older patients were included. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 84.6 years (SD 6.7), 52.6% of patients were women, 41.6% lived in nursing homes, 31% had C 3 chronic comorbidities, and 37% had dementia. Median prescribed dose of methotrexate was 5 mg/week. During the period of exposure to methotrexate (including 90-day washout period after treatment discontinuation), overall mortality was 26.3 (95% CI 21.9-31.5) per 100 person-years. After adjustment for relevant confounders, we found no statistically significant difference in the risk of death when comparing individuals with eGFR [ 60 mL/min at baseline, eGFR [ 45-60 mL/min, and eGFR \\ 45 mL/min (log-rank p = 0.11). There was also no association between eGFR at baseline and unplanned hospitalization for acute renal failure, liver failure, bone fracture, infectious disease, haematological event, or gastrointestinal event. Finally, clinician-reported outcomes (dose-decrease and treatment switch for clinical event, renal impairment or other biological adverse event) did not vary significantly according to eGFR at baseline, although older patients with eGFR \\ 45 mL/min experienced higher rates of treatment switch or adverse clinical or biological events. Conclusion: In the absence of robust evidence from randomized clinical trials, our observational study suggests that low-dose methotrexate is safe for the treatment of bullous pemphigoid in older adults with impaired renal function. Regular clinical monitoring is warranted to prevent adverse events and adapt treatment regimen if necessary.",

Conclusions: Most of our patients had mild or no cognitive decline, neither depression symptoms. Those with worst social support (SFES) were more depressed and had worst quality of life. Psychosocial assessment could be a predictor of mortality and admission at 6 months. We didn't find a relationship among the rest of the other variables. Background: Hematological malignancies can spread to the central nervous system (CNS) either as a focal lesion or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is generally an indolent disease. This case illustrates CNS invasion by MZL presenting as a delirium without B symptoms or any abnormalities on radiologic examinations. Case report: An 80 year old patient is described, presenting a subacute, progressive confusion. MMSE score was 21/30. The patient's medical history included monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) with a clone indicative for a MZL. After excluding most common etiologies through classical work-up including a normal head magnetic resonance imaging, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, showing an elevated protein and lymphocyte count. Beta-amyloid and tau protein levels in CSF were normal. Immunophenotyping of the lymphocytes confirmed CNS invasion by the MZL clone. Staging revealed mild splenomegaly. Prednisolone, intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy was initiated, leading to quick cognitive improvement with MMSE score of 28/30. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge a delirium in an older patient due to leptomeningeal carcinomatosis by a MZL has never been described. MZL is an indolent disease that rarely spreads to the CNS. To date, reports of CNS invasion by MZL describe focal intracranial lesions. After exclusion of common etiologies, physicians should remain vigilant when confronted with elderly presenting a confusional state with a prior history of MBL. This case demonstrates that the threshold for a LP should be low also for patients with normal imaging studies.",

Methods: The principal aim was to assess the differences in the time to clinical stability (defined as normalization of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygenation status, ability to eat and mental status) and mortality (30 days) between both groups. As secondary objectives we analyze differences among the different therapies and analyze prognosis factors in clinical outcomes (performance at discharge, 1-year post episode mortality). Retrospective analysis of electronic charts from January to June 2017. Two groups defined: elderly ([ 65 years-old) (EP) and non-elderly (\\ 65 years-old) (non-EP). Results: One hundred and thirty six episodes data of patients admitted throughout the 6-month study period. Elderly 82 (60%) and 54 non-EP 54 (40%).EP mean age EP 79 (SD 6) vs. non-EP 51 (SD 10). No differences were found in the clinical presentation, inflammatory-markers or empirical antimicrobial treatment. Time to stability was higher among EP mean: 6 days (SD 5) vs. non-EP 4 days (SD 3); p = 0.05. In a multivariable regression model the significant independent factors to time to stability were: being part of EP group [beta coeff 2.03 (95% CI 0.073-4.14); p = 0.049] and receiving Amoxicilin-Clavulanate [beta coeff -2.4 (95% CI -4.6 to -0.13); p = 0.03]. No differences in 30-day mortality were found (2(2.5%) in the EP group). However, mortality at 1-year after the CAP episode was higher among EP (13 (16%) vs 2(3%); p = 0.02). In the elderly group the factors associated with 1-year post CAP mortality were 6-month prior hospital admission (OR 6.26 95% CI 1.6-23.1; p = 0.006). Conclusions: In conclusion, in our series time to stability in CAP was higher among EP, and lower in those receiving amoxicillin-clavulanate. A prior hospital admission was strongly correlated with 1-year post episode mortality in the elderly group. Background: When treating older adults, a main factor to consider is functional status. Because appropriate assessments in clinical trials are frequently lacking, critical appraisal of treatment evidence with respect to functional status is challenging. Our aim was to identify and categorize assessments for functional status in clinical trials to allow for a retrospective characterization and indirect comparison of treatment evidence. Method: We conducted four different systematic reviews of randomized and non-randomized controlled clinical trials in older people with hypertension, diabetes, depression and dementia. All identified assessments that reflected functional status were analyzed. Assessments were categorized into four pre-defined different ''functional status levels''. If available from the literature, cut-offs were extracted. If not, they were defined by our expert group comprised of geriatricians, pharmacists, pharmacologists, neurologists, psychiatrists. Results: We identified 51 instruments for assessment that included measures of functional status. While some had clearly defined cut-offs across our predefined categories, many others did not. In most cases, no cut-offs existed for slightly impaired or severely impaired older adults. Missing cut-offs or values to adjust were determined by our expert group using a patient-centred approach and will be presented as described.",

However, the relationship between vitamin D and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains to be determined. In this study, we assessed the association between vitamin D deficiency and H. pylori infection. Methods: This cross-sectional study included patients aged 65 and over, who underwent gastroscopy and had gastric biopsy performed between 2010 and 2017. Of the 441 patients, 254 had available 25-hydroxyvitamin D level results and were included in the analyses. Patients were categorized into H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (-) groups, according to histopathological examination results of gastric biopsies. Serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL were defined as vitamin D deficiency. Results: Of all patients, 43 were H. pylori (+) and 211 were H. pylori (-). More patients had vitamin D deficiency (\\ 20 ng/mL) in the H. pylori (+) group than the H. pylori (-) group (86 vs 67.3%, p = 0.014). The proportion of H. pylori (+) patients decreased across increasing quartiles of 25(OH) vitamin D levels (p for trend = 0.010).

Introduction: Falls are one of the preventable geriatric syndromes which can lead to significant disabilities in older adults. In this study we aimed to assess whether nocturnal blood pressure (BP) changes are associated with falls. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we included 199 hypertensive patients aged over 60 years. All patients underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Patients were classified according to changes in their nocturnal systolic BP from daytime systolic BP as follows: dipper (D) [ 10% decrease, non-dipper (ND) 0-10% decrease, reverse-dipper (RD) increase to any extent. Falls were defined as any fall history in the recent 1 year. Results: Out of 199 patients (61.3% female; median age 76.6, range 61-100), 47 (23.6%) had a history of fall, and 12.6%, 49.7%, 37.7% of patients had D, ND and RD BP patterns, respectively.

Abdominal visceral adipose tissue volume is associated with an increased risk of GERD. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between erosive esophagtis (ERD) and minimal change esophagitis (MCD) in terms of central obesity. Introduction: Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is an acute reversible left ventricular dysfunction, which occurs in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Its onset is frequently related to physical or emotional stress; the pathogenesis of this condition is unknown, but some authors hypothesized a catecholamine-induced myocardial stunning or a coronary spasm. Recurrence is uncommon, occurring in 3-10% of patients. Methods: We describe a fivefold recurrent TTC in a geriatric patient with left anterior descending (LAD) artery myocardial bridge. Results: A 70-year old patient was hospitalized in 2015 for chest pain presenting at rest, ST elevation and mild troponin I increase; the echocardiogram revealed a mild depression of left ventricular function and apical akinesis, suggesting TTC. Coronary angiography showed patent coronary arteries, confirming the diagnosis; a LAD myocardial bridge was detected, with no evidence of obstruction. During the following 3 years, the patient experienced four TTC recurrences, all with benign course and treated with medical therapy (beta-blocker and calcium-antagonist). For each episode, no physical or emotional stressor could be identified as a trigger. Conclusions: This is the first case report of fivefold recurrent TTC, presenting with two additional unusual features: the absence of triggering stress and a LAD myocardial bridge. The lack of triggers could support the hypothesis of a non-catecholaminergic etiology and suggest a role of myocardial bridging as potential substrate in the pathogenesis of TTC. Coronary spasm related to bridging may be supposed, in agreement with some studies reporting a higher prevalence of this finding in patients with TTC.",

Methods: To determine the occurrence of CA, we performed Congo red staining in 50 prostate and 81 lung samples obtained from postmortem patients administered at Kumamoto University Hospital from 2007 to 2017. To identify the precursor protein of prostatic CA, we performed mass spectrometry for prostatic CA isolated from prostatic glands by means of laser microdissection.

Results: We found prostatic CA in 43 (86%) of 50, and lung CA in 2 (2%) of 81 autopsied patients. Those CA contained amyloid deposits which were Congo red positive and showed apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Mass spectrometric analysis and immunoblotting revealed that full-length lactoferrin was the major component of CA.

Cognitive status and physical performance may be affected by antihypertensive drugs. In this study, we aimed to investigate how antihypertensive agents affect cognitive and physical status in older diabetics. Methods: The study was conducted retrospectively and 453 (311 female vs. 142 male) diabetic patients were included. Patients were divided into groups according to the antihypertensive drugs they were using, groups were compared with independent-T test in terms of arithmetic means of mini-mental state examination (MMSE), geriatric depression scale (GDS), grip strength and gait speed. Risk analysis was done by logistic regression analysis. p \\ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The average age of participants were 73.12 \u00b1 6.18. MMSE arithmetic means were found to be higher among patients using ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers than those who did not use these drugs (25.49 \u00b1 4.11 vs. 24.27 \u00b1 4.72, p: 0.025; 25.30 \u00b1 4.35 vs. 24 .07 \u00b1 4.73, p: 0.006; respectively).

Conclusions: We recommend that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers should be preferred in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease and/or dementia. We also suggest that ACE inhibitors should be preferred to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), because in our study ARBs found no positive effect on MMSE. Additionally, it may be considered to avoid the use of calcium channel blockers to preserve functional status.",

Genetic testing was not required especially that it would not affect the management, however the family could have preferred to do the test.

Material and methods: Thirty-eight old age patients with relapse of CD after TSA were enrolled and randomly underwent a second surgery or GKRS as the next therapeutic approach. They were followed for a mean period of 3.05 \u00b1 0.8 years by physical examination and hormone measurement as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Patients admitted in Neurosurgery department for operation and stay in hospital for mean 4 days, but in Gamma Knife Center, they admitted in morning and Discharged at evening without any generalized anesthesia. No significant difference was observed in sex ratio, mean age, adenoma type, follow-up duration, and initial hormone level between the two groups. No significant relationship was found between preoperative 24-h free urine cortisol and disease-free months or tumor volume among both groups. There is significant less complications in GKRS group with less length of hospital stay and no delirium report after gamma knife procedure. Our statistical analysis showed higher recurrence-free interval in the GKRS group compared with TSA group. Conclusion: With longer recurrence-free interval, GKRS could be considered a good and safe treatment alternative to repeated TSA in recurrent CD especially in older community with less morbidity and complications.",

So we investigated past working exposure to CS2 characteristics from surviving ex-workers of a rayon manufacturing plant including cumulative CS2 exposure index. Furthermore, we studied prevalence of their chronic diseases recently after many years. Methods: We interviewed 633 ex-workers identified as CS2 poisoning-related occupational diseases to determine demographic and occupational characteristics and reviewed their medical records. The work environment measurement data from 1992 was used as a reference.

The uncertainty about prognosis and life expectancy, may be reduced by using our study outcomes when informing YOD persons and families about prognosis. Furthermore, intensive care support, including advanced care, is needed for a prolonged time. Introduction: Advancing age represents the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the identification of biomarkers able to define what characterizes physiological aging from AD may represent a potential starting point for novel preventive strategies. Among these biomarkers telomeres seem promising targets. Interestingly, high intake of carotenoid-rich food may play a role in protecting telomeres. Accordingly, low serum b-carotene concentrations have been found in AD subjects when compared with controls. We aim at investigating the hypothesis that the lower b-carotene in AD might be associated with markers of accelerated cellular aging, including telomerase activity and shortened telomere length. Methods: The study was conducted in 93 old age subjects, 53 AD and 40 sex-and age-matched healthy controls. Telomerase activity in PBMC has been evaluated by a PCR-ELISA protocol. The b-carotene levels were obtained by HPLC and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype by RFL-PCR. Results: Subject affected by AD had significantly lower plasmatic levels of b-carotene (448 \u00b1 66 mg/ml) as compared with healthy controls (497 \u00b1 59 mg/ml, p \\ 0.0001). In all population b-carotene significantly and positively correlated with telomerase activity controlling for gender (r = 0.280, p = 0.029). The association between bcarotene and AD risk (OR: 1.012, 95% CI 1.004-1.020, p = 0.004) was independent of age, gender, smoking habit and ApoE genotype. A final model having telomerase activity variability as the dependent variable while age, gender, smoking habit and b-carotene as independent variables, showed that b-carotene was independently associated with telomerase variability (b = 0.286, p = 0.035). Conclusion: Our data show that in this cohort lower plasmatic bcarotene levels are associated with lower peripheral telomerase activity and AD risk.",

Risk is associated with neuroleptics OR = 2.5 (95% CI 1.2; 5.04)adjusted for CNS-D (adj): OR = 1.9 (95% CI 0.88; 4.31); anti-Parkinson drugs: OR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.19; 6.73)-adj.: OR = 1.3 (95% CI 0.52; 3.51); benzodiazepines: OR = 4.4 (95% CI 1.01; 18.93)-adj.: OR 2 (95% CI 0.42; 9.5). With antidepressants we find a 2.1 fold risk for dysphagia (95% CI 0.96; 4.72), not affected by CNS-D-adj. Preliminary conclusion: As well as in patients with central nervous system diseases and without we can identify specific drug groups associated with risk of aggravating and even inducing dysphagia respectively. Restricted indication for neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants might be a preventative contribution and requires implementation in future dysphagia guidelines.",

The effects of long-term, high levels of physical activity in old age are less known. The prevalence of asthma in competing cross-country skiers have been subject to several discussions. We wanted to study the prevalence of asthma in older, still competing, cross-country skiers. Methods: The Birkebeiner Aging Study recorded self-seported asthma and smoking habits for 555 participants in the 54 km Birkebeiner skirace in 2009, aged 65-90 years. The findings were compared to an age-and sex-matched cohort from the Tromso-6 population study. Validated and identical questionnaires regarding asthma, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking habits were used in both surveys. Chi square and T tests were used when appropriate. Results: The skiers had participated in the Birkebeiner race for a median of 14 times, indicating long-term, engagement in crosscountry skiing. 205(38%) of the skiers reported the highest level of regular, leisure-time physical activity, wereas only 1(0.2%) of the controls. The prevalence of self-reported asthma was 51(9%) and 44(8%) among the skiers and controls respectively (p = 0.5). A history of ever-smoking was reported for 199(36%) and 392(71%) respectively (p \\ 0.001). Mean age of onset of astma was 45 and 46 yrs (p = 0.8) and there were no sex differences (p = 0.2). Key conclusion: long-term, competing, cross-country skiers have the same prevalence of self-reported asthma as the general population, despite a significantly lower exposure to sigarette smoke. Long-term, crosscountry skiing might be associated to an increased risk of asthma independent of smoking history.",

Objective: To identify and compare the risk factors associated with single and recurrent falls in elderly Canadians. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study that uses data from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Healthy Aging. It included 16,369 individuals aged 65 years and older. Data related to the incidence of single (one fall) and recurrent falls (C 2 falls) in the previous 12 months, as well as associated factors from selected variables (demographics, general health and functional condition, chronic conditions, medication use, and fall history) were examined by univariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression modeling. Results: This study found that 19.8% of the participants had experienced falls in the past year with 7.2% of them being recurrent fallers. The multinomial logistic regression modeling showed that participants who were males (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-2.0) and perceived their health as being poor to fair (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.8) were more likely to experience recurrent falls when compared to single falls. Relative to single fallers, recurrent fallers were also more likely to have arthritis (OR 1.3; 95% CI 1.0-1.7), urinary incontinence (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.9), polypharmacy (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1) and fear of falling (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1). Conclusion: Findings of this study suggest that fall prevention efforts should consider a variety of risk factors in order to ensure the most effective interventions for this rapidly increasing and vulnerable population.",

Introduction: Alzheimer's disease is one of the most devastating and costly condition worldwide. Due to the increase in life expectancy and to the population ageing it is estimated that the number of people with dementia will double in the next 30 years. In Romania there are about 300,000 people suffering from Alzheimer's dementia so far and it is estimated that the number will triple by 2025. Unfortunately, about 20% of this global number are diagnosed in the advanced stages of the disease, when even the best therapeutic plans are associated with modest results, institutionalization and very high costs. This is why early identification of people at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease becomes an absolute priority. Methods: CAIDE score is designed for general adult population as a tool that estimates the risk of Alzheimer's dementia in the next 20 years. Age, gender, education, systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol, and physical activity are used to count the score. An abnormal score should be the trigger to start prevention of chronic diseases in order to achieve a healthy ageing. Results: We present the partial outcomes of a prospective study that evaluates the predictive capacity of CAIDE score in the general adult population, and whether it can be improved by taking into account other mid-life risk factors. The evaluation of the cognitive status would be performed each year to monitor if there are changes in the normal evolution according to the ageing. If alterations of the cognitive status should occur, the identification of the responsable factor(s) should trigger specific prevention.",

However, little is known whether overweight/obesity affect the outcomes of a resistance exercise program. Community-dwelling Icelandic old adults (N = 236, 73.7 \u00b1 5.7 years) participated in a 12-week resistance exercise program. Anthropometrics, muscular strength and physical function were measured at baseline and endpoint. Group was defined retrospectively as normal, overweight and obese BMI level according to international cut off values. Statistical analyses were corrected for age and gender. Of the participants, 22.0% were normal, 41.4% were overweight and 36.6% were obese. BMI categories were neither related to drop-out (11.9%) nor to attendance (88.4%). All groups experienced improvements in outcome measurements, but improvements in individuals with obese BMI were less pronounced compared to normal BMI individuals. There was similar weight gain in the groups (+0.48 kg, P \\ 0.001), however, normal BMI group gained more lean mass (+0.70 kg, P = 0.015), appendicular muscle mass (+0.42 kg, P = 0.007) but lost more fat mass (-0.75 kg, P = 0.081) as compared to obese BMI group. This resulted in a greater change in body fat percent in subjects with normal BMI as compared to obese (-1.5%, P = 0.014). Absolute gains in quadriceps strength were similar between groups, but relative to body weight, normal BMI group gained more than obese BMI group (+ 0.31 N/kg, P = 0.017). This translated into a greater improvement in 6-minutes-walk-for-distance (+ 24 m, P \\ 0.001) in normal BMI group compared to obese BMI group. Interestingly, grip strength increased more in obese BMI group (2.4 lb., P = 0.020). Timed-up-and-go improved similarly in all groups (-0.64 s, P \\ 0.001). Independently from their BMI status, older adults benefited from a resistance exercise program in terms of body composition and physical function. However, obese individuals improved significantly less than normal weight participants although there was similar attendance to the exercise classes. Great care has to be taken of obese elderly in order to maintain their physical independence as long as possible.",

Methods: 1173 patients aged C 75 who were admitted to the geriatric ward of the University of Tokyo Hospital between 2012 and 2017 were enrolled. From 175 af patients (men 47%, mean age 85.5 years), we identified 94 (men 48%, mean age 87 years) patients with CKD. We followed the patients for 1-5 years after baseline. Stroke, major bleeding and all-cause mortality was investigated for outcome. Results: Among them, 53.2% were taking OAC therapy. The incidence of stroke in those taking OACs were higher than those not taking OACs (HR, 5.85; 95% CI 0.01-0.89; P = 0.03) and major bleeding was marginally higher but not statistically significant (HR 4.58; 95% CI 0.84-85.0; P = 0.08). The incidence of mortality in those taking OACs were marginally lower but not statistically significant (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.23-1.21; P = 0.13).",

Particularly for community-dwelling elderly, a fall can cause a sudden change in their previous independence. Consequently, older people restrict their physical activity and become socially isolated, which further increases their risk of falling. Little attention has been paid to interventions in only few systematic reviews. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and summarize effective interventions to prevent or reduce fear of falling among community-dwelling older people. Method: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and different search engines and reference lists were scanned for additional studies. Only English and German articles between 2005 and 2015 were included, which focus on people over 65 years and who were living at home during the trial. Two independent reviewers critically assessed the risk of bias in the included studies by using the ''risk of bias tool'' from the Cochrane Collaboration. If the interventions and diagnostic instruments were similar, the data were pooled in a meta-analysis.",

Discussion: The results of this systematic literature review show the effectiveness of interventions with different components for the prevention or reduction of the fear of falling. Due to the variety of definitions of fear of falling, the different instruments for measurement, as well as differing study populations, the comparability of the included studies is questionable. In addition, the results have to be regarded with care, due to the included studies limited methodological quality. Further studies, especially from the nursing science perspective, with a special focus on certain high risk groups are required.",

The service identifies patients who are vulnerable in the community, the majority of whom are elderly. It is a non-clinical service comprising of three care navigators who liaise and share information between acute and community-based health services, social and third sector groups. Methods: To evaluate the services' impact on the number of ED attendances and non-elective inpatient admissions through comparing data 3 months before, and 3 months post referral. Results: In the 3 months prior to referral the 71 patients seen by the Care Navigators had 136 ED attendances with a resultant 106 inpatient admissions. In the following 3 months ED attendances reduced to 57, a reduction of 58% and admissions by 64, a reduction of 60.4%. The preservice admission data accounted for 612 bed days (length of stay plus one), which reduced to 312 for subsequent admissions, a 49% reduction. Key conclusions: 3 months post referral there was a significant reduction in ED attendances and hospital admissions with a huge improvement in inpatient stay. The service has supported those who frequently attend ED either through frailty or lifestyles crisis. This highlights the potential of the service to help prevent unnecessary admissions amongst the vulnerable population and free up hospital capacity with economic benefit.",

Three distinct profiles of independence were identified: independent (68%), moderately independent (24%) and dependent (8%). Predictors of moderately independent were age. Predictors of the dependence were school level, lifestyle, family support, number of daily medications, urinary incontinence, cognitive disorders, nutrition, physical performance and frailty. Conclusion: Half of the population was independent. A quarter had moderate to severe dependence. To our knowledge, such a study has not yet been the subject of research. The results of this study indicate that some sociodemographic and physiological criteria are good predictors of moderate to severe independence loss.

In the Cox regression analysis, an interaction over time was found. However, unlike two small prospective cohort studies [3, 4] , we did not find an association in the first year of follow-up. Discussion: In contrast to previous studies [3, 4] , hyperkyphosis was not statistically significant associated with fall incidence in the multifactorial models in this large cohort of community-dwelling older adults. This difference may be due to the healthier population of this large cohort study and to variation in kyphosis measurement methods. In future studies, the correlation and validity of the various kyphosis measurement methods should be investigated in geriatric patients. Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is a novel type 2 diabetes risk factor, but little is known about the GGT on the development of diabetes in Korean elderly populations. We evaluated 257 women and 337 men, more than 65 years of age, without baseline diabetes. From the baseline health screening to the follow-up examination, the development of diabetes, based on changes in GGT quartile levels, was analyzed. The development of diabetes gradually increased with an increase in the circulating levels of GGT. After adjusting for confounders, for the highest quartile of GGT, hazard ratios of diabetes compared with the lowest quartile were 3.54 (95% confidence interval: 1.21-10.31, P = 0.021) in women and 5.08 (95% confidence interval: 2.39-10.80, P = 0.009) in men. These findings in Korean elderly populations suggest potential utility of GGT as an additional biomarker in predicting the development of diabetes.",

We aimed to establish the acceptability of fortified foods to older inpatients including those who have dementia and frailty. Methods: The intervention involved offering older patients in two UK hospitals between-meal fortified foods (enhanced with protein and energy) three times a day for 6 days, over 2 weeks. Fortified foods included biscuits, soup, cake, and ice-cream, providing on average 210 kcal and 5 g protein/serving. The type and frequency of fortified foods ordered by patients was recorded. Patients' views were captured by a 10-point likeability scale. Interviews were conducted with 15 staff members to explore their views. Results: 169 patients ordered 500 portions of fortified foods. Ice cream was the most frequently requested food (199, 40%), followed by cakes (120, 24%) and soups (125, 25%) and least biscuits (56, 11%).

Methods: Community dwelling subjects from the Reykjavik area in Iceland (N = 229, 73.7 \u00b1 5.7 years, 58.2% female) participated in this cross-sectional study. Leisure time physical activity (LTPA), dietary intake, body composition and background variables were assessed. 25OHD was measured in fasting blood samples. Results: Mean LTPA was 5.7 \u00b1 5.6 h/week and the most common activities were walking and gardening.

Results: Mean age was 73.7 \u00b1 5.7 years. According to linear models corrected for age, smoking and gender, higher obesity was related to lower quadriceps strength relative to body weight, to lower physical function, i.e., lower gait speed and longer TUG time, as well as to lower 25OHD but to higher PTH. Of the participants, only 1% of men and 4% of women had osteoporosis, the corresponding numbers for osteopenia were 35 and 45%. Obesity was related to high bone mineral density (T-score) in femur, lumbar and total. Conclusions: In this highly functional cohort of old adults, obesity was related to poorer strength and less physical function in older adults which should make obese individuals more prone for falls and fractures. However, although obesity was also related to a poorer hormonal profile, obesity was related to higher BMD.

In Germany, the older population is at risk of insufficient micronutrient intake, but representative studies on micronutrient status in old and very old adults are scarce. Objectives: We estimated the prevalence of subclinical vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies among older adults, aged 65-93 years, from the KORA-Age study in Augsburg, Germany (n = 1079), and determined associated predictors. Methods: Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), folate, vitamin B12, and iron were analyzed and compared to selected cut-offs for subclinical micronutrient deficiency. Predictors of subclinical deficiency were determined using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of subclinical vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiencies were high, with 52.0 and 27.3% of individuals having low 25OHD (\\ 50 nmol/L) and low vitamin B12 concentrations (\\ 221 pmol/L), respectively. Furthermore, 11.0% had low iron (men \\ 11.6 lmol/L, women \\ 9.0 lmol/L) and 8.7% had low folate levels (\\ 13.6 nmol/L). Common predictors associated with subclinical micronutrient deficiency included very old age, physical inactivity, frailty and no/irregular use of supplements. Conclusion: Subclinical micronutrient deficiency is a public health concern among older German adults, especially for vitamins D and B12. The predictors identified provide further rationale for screening high-risk subgroups and developing targeted public health interventions to tackle prevailing micronutrient inadequacies among older adults.",

There is little evidence on the views of older people and their carers regarding the management of malnutrition in the community. Aims: To explore the views and dietary practices of older people at risk of malnutrition and their carers, to identify gaps in knowledge, barriers/facilitators to eating, and to explore potential interventions to support nutrition in the community. Methods: Up to 40 semi-structured interviews with communitydwelling people aged C 75 years from general practices, identified as malnourished/at risk of malnutrition, and their carers. Thematic analysis is being used to identify key emergent themes and their meaning, with input from the research team including lay members. Findings: Early interview findings (n = 27) suggest that 'healthy eating' beliefs established in earlier life are maintained in later life. Some participants were aware of recent weight loss, reduced appetite or eating smaller portions, although they did not always understand why. Some reported reduced appetite and low energy which they considered part of normal ageing, whereas others attributed weight loss to acute illness, incomplete recovery following discharge from hospital, mental health issues and other conditions. Although only a few of them had discussed weight loss with their GP, many liked the idea of a nutritional intervention delivered in primary care. Some felt that the doctor was best placed to provide that support, whereas others would welcome advice from a nurse, dietitian or other trained professional.",

Material and methods: The study group consisted of 481 elderly patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, divided into two groups, 319 patients with rhythm disorders and 162 without rhythm disorders, from the Geriatrics Department, ''Dr. C.I.Parhon '', Iasi. All patients were applied a questionnaire Mini assessment nutrition (MNA), validated screening malnutrition. Results and discussions: Age group shows a significantly higher percentage of people with malnutrition at the age of 75 years (76%; p = 0.011) and from 24% of people with normal nutritional status, 41.2% associate different degrees of obesity (p = 0,001).In the group with rhythm disorders, 59.2% of patients are at risk of malnutrition and 15.7% are malnourished. Similar percentages were also recorded in the group without rhythm disorders-60.5%, at risk of malnutrition and 15.4% malnutrition. Of those malnourished, 66.7% had rhythm disorders and 66.8% of patients with malnutrition risk had rhythm disorders (p = 0.995). Conclusions: Malnutrition and the risk of malnutrition among geriatric patients is a cardiovascular risk factor. Patients declared with a normal nutritional status through MNA and with obesity degrees require additional exploration to detect sarcopenic obesity. The absence of statistically significant percentage differences between the two studied groups allows us to affirm that malnutrition is not a direct factor for rhythm disorders.",

Patients and methods: A total of 200 older subjects (aged 73 \u00b1 10 years) from Lodz, Poland, participated in the study: 100 from nursing homes (31 men and 69 women) and 100 age-and sexmatched community-dwelling controls. Nutritional and functional status we assessed with Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL) and Timed ''Up & Go'' test (TUG). The pattern of consumption of various nutrients was analyzed in detail. Results: There were no differences in energy intake but the NH group consumed significantly less animal protein, long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals and more sucrose. According to MNA, only 19% had normal nutritional status (vs. 78% of CD group). Higher intake of sucrose and lower intake of protein, vitamins C, B6, B2, B3, folates, magnesium, iron, copper, phosphorus and potassium was associated with worse results in the ADL, TUG and MMSE tests. Conclusion: This analysis shows deeply unsatisfactory nutritional status and enormous deficiencies in the diet of institutionalized elderly. The observed relationships indicate the importance of intake of an appropriate level of protein, vitamins B and minerals, and limitation of sucrose intake. Stronger correlations in the CD group are likely associated with a greater diversity of their diet.",

Geriatric malnutrition and obesity are substantial health problems. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition and obesity in elderly individuals attending a geriatric outpatient clinic in Turkey. Methods: This study included 520 elderly patients. All patients underwent Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) test via face to face interview. The participants were divided into four groups, as follows: underweight group (BMI \\ 22.0 kg/m 2 ), normal weight group (BMI 22.0-24.9 kg/m 2 ), overweight group (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ) and obese group (BMI C 30 kg/m 2 ). Results: The mean age was 71.8 \u00b1 5.8 and 285 patients (54.8%) were female. 11 (2.1%) of them were underweight, 91 (17.5%) were normal, 193 (37.1%) were overweight and 225 (43.3%) were obese in conformity with BMI measurements. According to MNA-SF, 37 (7.1%) were diagnosed with malnutrition, 165 (31.7%) had a risk of malnutrition, and 318 (61.2%) displayed a good nutritional status. 68.7% of them were obese or at risk of malnutrition and 33.7% were both obese and at the risk of malnutrition. Conclusion: At least two of every three elderly patients exhibited malnutrition or obesity as a consequence of a disequilibrium in nutrition. To prevent malnutriton and obesity in old age, elderly patients should be evaluated comprehensively through several domains including assessment of medical, nutritional, or social statues, novel strategies should be found to promote physical activity through out the society and to raise awareness about the nutrition.",

Background: Disease-related malnutrition leads to poor appetite and decreased food intake. This affects the convalescence negatively in older adults after discharge from hospital. Objective: To compare the effect of adequate and inadequate energy intake 2 week after discharge on weight loss and ADL function when measured 8 weeks after discharge. Method: The study sample comprises two intervention groups from an RCT. Inclusion: Malnourishment or risk of malnutrition, 75+ years, home dwelling and living alone. Exclusion: Terminal illness, cognitive impairment and nursing home residency. At discharge, all patients received a diet plan covering their specific daily energy needs. Individualised nutritional counselling was given 1, 2 and 4 weeks after discharge. Based on patient reported data on daily food intake at week two after discharge, the patients were grouped into two groups (1) participants who had adequate energy intake (AQ) and (2) participants who had inadequate intake (IAQ). Weight loss and ADL was analysed using v 2 -test. Results: In our study, 111 patients were included 2 weeks after discharge (AQ = 48, IAQ = 63). Both groups had lost weight (AQ = mean 0.5 kg, IAQ = mean 1.6 kg), but in the IAQ group more patients had (p = 0.03). Mean ADL improved in both groups, but there was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.21). ADL deteriorated in 6% of AQ patients and 17% of IAQ patients (p = 0.06). Conclusion: Adequate energy intake 2 weeks after discharge from hospital may reduce weight loss. A trend towards maintained ADL was seen 8 weeks after discharge of patients who had adequate energy intake at week two.",

Ageing is associated with many changes in the homeostatic systems involved in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance. This review provides an overview to relevant literature on fluid balance problems of older people. Methods: A literature search (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) was carried out, using MEDLINE, Pub Med, Science direct, Scopus, Cochrane library, Turkish Medical Index and related intuitional websites. All references including researches or reviews were included in this search. Results: In the relevant literature, there are many references addressing fluid and electrolyte balance problems of the elderly people. Age-related physiological changes predispose elderly people to fluid imbalances which can cause morbidity and mortality with causes ranging from physical disability restricting access to fluid intake to iatrogenic causes including polypharmacy and unmonitored diuretic usage. Dehydration is the most common fluid and electrolyte problem among the elderly. Older adults are also susceptible to water retention and related electrolyte abnormalities. Key conclusions: As fluid imbalances in the elderly are associated with poor health outcomes, including increased risk of disability and mortality, prevention may improve health, functional status, and quality of life. Staff in institutions should be careful about the hydration status of any elderly people. Improved awareness, diagnosing and managing are important among health care providers to prevent fluid balance problems in elderly people.",

Social factors, such as social support, social networks and participation in activities, have been linked with higher diet quality in older people. This pilot study describes the implementation and evaluation of a social networking tool (GENIE-Generating Engagement in Network Involvement), which facilitates engagement with local support resources and activities. Using a randomised control trial design, the study aimed to assess the impact of GENIE on diet quality in a group of older community-dwelling adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and to compare changes with those in a control group. Methods: Twenty-two men and women [mean (SD) age 71.7 (6.7) years] were recruited from a local COPD Service. Diet was assessed by administered food frequency questionnaire; diet scores were calculated to describe diet quality at baseline and follow-up [median follow-up time in months (IQR) 3. Conclusions: These data indicate potential for beneficial effects of GENIE on quality of diet among older adults. It is not clear why diet quality declined among control participants during the study. Further evaluation in a larger group is needed.",

Fluid thickener is one such compensatory measure. Two varieties of thickening products are available-starch-based and gum-based. The gum-based product has seen growing use secondary to reported shortcomings of starch-based products, such as poor stability, product becoming too thick over time or becoming thin on contact with salivary amylase, and ambiguous instructions [3] . Method: Starch-based and gum-based thickening products were trialled on the acute stroke unit at two different time periods. During each period, drinks available to patients (at their bedside) were rated by a qualified SLT for their compliance with specific fluid consistency recommendation. Results: Total of 22 assessments were carried out. Compliance of the starch-based product was found to be poor; only 11% of drinks rated as appropriate to patient's specific SLT recommendation.

Muscle mass, strength and physical function are known to decline with age. This is associated with the development of geriatric syndromes including sarcopenia and frailty. These conditions are associated with disability, falls, longer hospital stay, institutionalisation, and death. Moreover, they are associated with reduced quality of life, as well as substantial costs to health services. Dietary protein is essential for skeletal muscle function. Older adults have shown evidence of anabolic resistance, where greater amounts of protein are required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Research shows that resistance exercise has the most beneficial effect on preserving skeletal muscle. A synergistic effect has been noted when this is combined with dietary protein, yet studies in this area lack consistency. This is due, in part, to variation that exists within dietary protein, in terms of dose, quality, source, amino acid composition and timing. Research has targeted participants that are replete in dietary protein with negative results. Inconsistent measures of muscle mass, muscle function, physical activity and diet are used. The plasticity and diversity of the gut microbiome and its metabolome represent exciting future prospects for personalised medicine. The gut microbiome is substantially altered with ageing and the development of frailty. It remains an unexplored filter between diet and host physiology which may contribute to anabolic resistance. Research is needed on the role of dietary protein in muscle ageing and investigate the influence of the gut microbiome in relation to anabolic resistance, skeletal muscle mass and function. This review attempts to summarise these issues.",

Little is known about how oral pain impacts on people living with dementia in the community and their carers. This study aimed to explore informal carers' experiences of identifying and managing oral pain and discomfort in people living with dementia, and barriers and enablers they encountered. Methods: Focus groups with of informal carers of people living with dementia were conducted, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Carers' accounts suggested that day-to-day contact was required to identify oral pain and discomfort, and a symptomology of the signs and symptoms was developed. Carers' accounts also highlighted problems in maintaining oral health, difficulties in accessing the mouth, managing dentures, competing demands, and difficulties in accessing treatment due to health service-, behavioural-and treatment-related barriers.

Older age is often associated with an increased prevalence of dental caries, periodontal disease, dry mouth, fungal infections, ulceration and oral cancer [1] . The admission of an older person to an acute care hospital is an important point of care for enabling health screening. The aim of our study was to institute an oral health screening program by volunteer oral hygienists as part of a comprehensive care program. Methods: As part of the Hospital Elder Life Program [2] , frail older patients at risk for delirium and functional decline are provided volunteer support to maintain cognitive function, nutrition and hydration, and mobility. As an addition to this program, volunteer oral hygienists visited the patients, administered an oral health questionnaire, performed an oral examination and cleaning of dentures, and advised patients regarding ongoing oral health care. Results: A total of 100 patients over the age of 65 years hospitalized in acute care internal medicine departments at the Rambam Health Care Campus were visited by volunteer oral hygienists. Clinical findings included a coated tongue (30%), redness of the mucosa (20%), gingival swelling (18%), plaque accumulation (48%), and poorly-maintained dentures (34%). Staff and patient satisfaction with the visit and advice of the oral hygienist was high. Introduction: It is well known that there is an association between oral health and geriatric syndromes including malnutrition as well as chronic systemic illnesses. The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) predicts short-and long-term mortality in older subjects and has been validated for several acute and chronic diseases. The aim of this study is to identify associations between MPI and oral health. Methods: This study begun December 2017 and will include about 100 older subjects aged 65 or older hospitalized in a large German hospital. Besides a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and prognosis evaluation by means of MPI, an initial assessment of oral health is performed. To identify the oral health quality of life the Geriatric/General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) is used. To assess the current oral health status the Kayser-Jones Brief Oral Health Status Examination (BOHSE) and a specifically designed questionnaire including ''Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth-Index'' (DMFT) are used. After 6 and 12 months a reevaluation of dental diseases and use of dental treatment will be performed. Results: Until now, 34 patients (22 M, 77.8 \u00b1 6.0 years, 12F, 73.2 \u00b1 6.2 years) have been recruited. First results show a slightly positive correlation of MPI values to DMFT Index (q = 0.36, p [ 0.05) and a negative correlation to GOHAI Sum Score (q = -0.55, p \\ 0.05). More results are expected in July/August 2018. Conclusions: MPI might correlate to oral health status and oral health quality of life.",

In either case, one of the inevitable consequences is oral malodor. Not only bacteria are the cause of bad smell noticed in the mouth. The destruction of proteins and sulfur-containing compounds on the tonsils and tongue surface can also cause bad odor in the mouth. One of the common complaints in the elderly is the mouth dryness (xerostomia) and it is an important source of oral malodor. Burning mouth syndrome is another cause of oral malodor in elderly individuals. The significantly relation of oral malodor and the accumulation of bacterial plaque on the tongue, oral dryness, burning mouth, and overnight denture wear is shown by Nalcaci and Baran (2008). Incorrect restorations, and implants, are another important cause of oral bad breath in the elderly. Key conclusions: Periodic intraoral and restorative controls should be done frequently and carefully in the elderly. In the elderly, oral malodor can be prevented by carefully controlling with physician and dentist.",

We examined the eating and swallowing dysfunctions in elderly peoples with Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the basis of FAST. Methods: Subjects included 175 elderly AD patients requiring care in Japan. The subjects' average age was 86.6 \u00b1 6.1, and included 29 males and 146 females. Subjects underwent vital function tests (selffeeding assessment, screening test for swallowing dysfunctions, oralfunction assessment was included), cognitive assessment (ex. FAST), and a basic information survey. All data was classified by FAST and analyzed with SPSS ver.22 (IBM) for eating and swallowing dysfunctions. The protocol for the present study was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Results: Self-feeding assessment showed that eating difficulty occurred from the FAST6e stage (p \\ 0.001). Signs of dysphagia, became pronounced especially after FAST7a (p = 0.042), and the dysphagia screening test with a stethoscope showed choking and/or wet hoarseness sounds in the pharynges increased after FAST6e (p = 0.022). Prominent difficulty in rinsing became apparent after FAST7b (p \\ 0.001), and difficulty in gargling was seen after FAST6e (p \\ 0.001). However, meal time lengthened (over 40 min) after FAST6b and was further lengthened (over 60 min) after FAST7b (p = 0.021). Conclusion: Eating and swallowing dysfunctions were greater with increasing severity of AD. These results showed that the decline in oral functions occurred after finding self-feeding dysfunction, difficulty in gargling and signs of dysphagia. It is necessary to offer predictive support for elderly patients with AD. We developed a viewpoint of dental care and mealtime care for Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

Introduction: Accurate discharge summary documentation plays a crucial role in the continuing health care of patients discharged from hospital. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges provides guidance on the structure and content of discharge summaries. Content required includes a social and functional assessment, a list of new diagnoses, and details of the patient's past medical history (PMH). Methods: We performed a baseline audit to assess Trust-wide performance, and then designed a series of measures (including FY1 year-wide teaching, and induction training for doctors during each rotation) designed to improve the quality of discharge summaries. We presented the project to the different specialties involved at their respective clinical governance meetings. We then designed a novel live-feedback system to help facilitate the improvements. This allows us to analyse discharge summaries on a monthly basis using a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) approach, and feed the results back directly to the doctors completing the summaries. Results: We audited 482 discharge summaries across 7 wards. Several aspects of were recorded poorly. Specifically, these were: social assessment (included in only 23%), PMH (50%), and a list of diagnoses (59%).Our first PDSA cycle was completed in February 2018.

Hospital at Home care aims to avoid hospitalisation-associated adverse outcomes in older patients with cognitive impairment by providing hospital care in the patient's own environment. Methods and analysis: This randomised, non-blinded feasibility trial aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial in terms of the recruitment, use and acceptability of Hospital at Home care for older patients with cognitive impairment. The quality of care will be evaluated and the advantages and disadvantages of the Hospital at Home care programme compared with usual hospital care. Eligible patients will be randomised either to Hospital at Home care in their own environment or usual hospital care. The intervention consists of hospital level care provided at patients' homes, including visits from healthcare professionals, diagnostics (laboratory tests, blood cultures) and treatment. The control group will receive usual hospital care. Measurements will be conducted at baseline, during admission, at discharge and at 3 and 6 months after the baseline assessment.",

However, receiving informal care is common among older adults living in Iceland. The aim of this study is to analyze whether education is associated with the use of formal and informal care among older adults in Iceland. A survey of Icelandic older people was conducted including a national sample of 721 persons aged 65 years and older living in Iceland. Older adults living in nursing homes were excluded from the survey. The telephone survey included questions on socioeconomic status (education and occupation), social network, health status, activities of daily living, and the status of received help either from the community elderly care system and/or from close family members and friends. Among the total sample, 372 (52%) people reported to receive either type of care. Among those who received care, 197 (53%) people reported receiving informal care only. The status of receiving informal care had shown that people with higher education had a significantly lower risk to receive informal care compared with people with lower education [odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.97, p = 0.031], however formal care was not significantly associated with education level. Informal care which is provided from the social network and family members are an important source for the elderly care system in Iceland. The contribution of informal care/help should be recognized when preparing the care of older people. After attending this session, participants will know about formal and informal care in Icelandic old adults.

About the 2nd patient the CrCl of 18 mL/mn was sufficient to contraindicate ICM administration. Conclusion: Benefit/risk ratio and alternative imaging need to be discussed between radiologists and prescribers when patient profile is at risk especially in geriatric population. Safety is the main priority; yet, process of care should be reexamined in a multidisciplinary way. We modified scan requests by adding a box to let the possibility to prescribers to inform that ICM is not wanted.",

The aim of this study is to characterize the motor abilities with aging, including middle-aged subjects and using new descriptors, by combining both techniques, embedded in a recent ambulatory portable device. Materials and methods: Nine subjects participated in the STS test. Three were aged 25 \u00b1 2 years, four were aged 34.75 \u00b1 3.09 years, and two were aged 57 \u00b1 7.07 years. All of them performed sit-tostand motion 3 times at spontaneous pace. New features, were also tested in addition to previous descriptors [1] , in order to check their efficiency. For this purpose, 4 9 8 HD-sEMG grids were placed on the quadriceps muscle. Simultaneously, the trunk maximum acceleration was also measured. Thus, the results for the three age categories were statistically evaluated. The results showed that the statistical and also previous descriptors, tested on the three categories with ANOVA test, have a significant sensitivity to the motor efficiency with aging in the STS test (p \\ 0.001***) in agreement with [1] .",

Indeed, it is often said that old people are not interested in technologies, can't understand their utility or have not the physical capacity to use them. These stereotypes can negatively influence the adoption of technologies with aging. Indeed, despite the increasing availability of new technologies for the benefit of old people, their use is currently extremely low. Methods: We therefore wanted to explore, through an online survey widely distributed in Wallonia (Belgium) (11,579 respondents), the perception and use of new technologies by the olders. Results: With regard to the use of technologies, analyses indicate that older people use the smartphone and the tablet less than younger. However, results show that this lower use does not appear to be related to an inability, but rather to the fact that people do not perceive it as useful (p \\ 0.00). Furthermore, we note that the difficulties in using these technologies are relatively similar in the different age groups (41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90 years old) . The difficulties that can increase with age are generally related to the ergonomics of the device and not to a problem of sight (readability of the screen) or fine motor skills (writing with the touch keyboard). Conclusion: These data therefore seem to confirm that older people have the physical abilities to use new technologies and that they can be interested in them if they are useful and adapted to their needs.",

Methods: A retrospective case note review of 91 residents was mapped against metrics including MDT input, admission/ discharge Rockwood score, healthcare-associated morbidity, re-admission rates, advanced care plan (ACP) initiation and discharge destination. Results: All patients received a medical review. 83 (92%) patients saw physiotherapists, 82 (90%) social workers and 67 (74%) occupational therapists. At discharge, 17 (19%) patients improved their Rockwood score. 27 (30%) patients experienced delirium, 29 (32%) developed infections and there were 23 recorded falls. 16 of the 25 patients with pressure damage on arrival fully healed by discharge.

Participants were requested to conduct three ICCs per nursing home resident (NHR) over a 12-month period. The process evaluation aimed to explore the implementation, mechanisms of impact and contextual factors that influenced the intervention [2] . Methods: Quantitative data on implementation were collected throughout the study period. Qualitative data were collected through multidisciplinary focus groups in 11 nursing homes (NHs). Results: 1675 ICCs were registered for 681 NHRs [median (P25-P75): 3 (2-3) per NHR]. Overall, healthcare professionals were satisfied with ICCs and perceived benefits for themselves. Their perception of the impact on NHRs varied from limited impact to positive impact in terms of number of medications or cost. Several barriers and facilitators to the implementation and the outcomes of the ICCs were identified. They related to: (a) the intervention (e.g. the face-to-face and interdisciplinary aspects contributed to the success of ICCs, despite organizational constraints); (b) HCPs (e.g. GP's attitude); (c) organizational level (e.g. presence of a leader); (d) external context (e.g. financial incentives). Key conclusions: Quantitative as well as qualitative data on experiences and satisfaction were essential to generate recommendations for Belgian policymakers on the future implementation of ICCs in NHs, for example in terms of frequency, format, prerequisites References: 1.

With acute hospital bed occupancy in the English NHS running [ 90% and Emergency Departments consistently failing the 95% 4 h standard, pressure to maintain ''flow'' has concentrated focus on maximising discharge lounge use risking deterioration in patient care. Our aim was to understand the breakdown of time spent in the discharge lounge to optimise future development. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 88 patients attending the discharge lounge at Salford Royal Hospital during a week in April 2018. The patients were split into C 75 years and \\ 75 years groups. Time for the various determinants facilitating discharge (prescribing and dispensing of medication, completion of discharge summary, awaiting transport etc) was measured. Results: 40 patients were aged C 75 years and 44 were \\ 75 years. Mean time spent for patients C 75 years is 115.7 min with a standard deviation of 66.7 min; mean time spent for \\ 75 years is 94.6 min with a standard deviation of 61.4. Mean time taken for pharmacy to be alerted to prescribed medication for dispensing is 67.7 min with a standard deviation of 97.3. Average wait for patients in the discharge lounge was 113 min if medication was prescribed before patient arrival, and 143 min if it was incomplete. Conclusions: The high variance of time spent in the discharge lounge supports completion of the discharge summary and improved communication between ward and pharmacy prior to patients' transfer to the discharge lounge.",

Yet, during the last decades hospital beds in most European countries have been reduced, and further reductions are anticipated. In Denmark, this mismatch is expected to be alleviated by digital health, and the introduction of acute community nurses (ACN). ACNs may act as 'frontline officers' for early identification in-home of older citizens at risk of acute admission. In collaboration with primary care physicians (PCPs) timely treatment may be initiated thereby potentially reducing acute hospital admission. Methods: The ''GERI-toolbox'' is a portable toolbox containing Point of Care Testing (POCT) tools, including blood testing, for inhome clinical assessment. Values are uploaded via mobile network (3G/4G) to a generic digital platform (GTP), accessible to treating PCP, ACN, and hospital physicians. Results: The GERI-toolbox was implemented March 1, 2018 in four Danish municipalities and is ongoing. Implementation has been challenging as it involves organizational changes and overcoming professional barriers. Yet, the GERI-toolbox has already become a success. Trained ACNs feel that their competences are appreciated, and the PCPs receive nurse reports of higher quality. Preliminary results are promising with respect of reducing acute admissions. The study ends December 31, 2019. Key conclusions: The GERI-toolbox likely supports early clinical decision-making and has the potential to prevent acute hospital admission of older citizens. The concept may be adapted to other health care systems in Europe and should be further evaluated in a future cross-national multicentre study.",

Other recommendations concern screening for urinary tract infections, long term prescription of benzodiazepine, and antipsychotics for persons living with dementia. A recommendation on prescription review is currently being rewritten for more accuracy. We conducted two campaigns in 20 different wards, collecting data on 1036 patients. The results will be presented. Conclusion: Our dynamic approach allowed a strong collaboration with patients, a fast operationalization of recommendations, and a continuous adjustment to the context of care. The ENRICHME project was directed at development and evaluation of the impact of new solutions (including social robots) on supporting older people with mild cognitive impairment. The paper aims to present the results of a long-term (10 weeks) validation of the TIAGo robot (PAL Robotics, Spain) in the living environments of older persons in Poland. The validation was done with four persons (three women aged 66, 83 and 84 years, and one man aged 83 years); all of them had an ethnographic observation of qualitative parameters performed. The study also had a control arm (four subjects with standard care).All participants accepted the robot right after its presentation. They approached it with confidence, considered it safe and believed they could handle it with support from the ENRICHME team. They pointed out that (with the robot) there was someone to talk to at home, it was easier to cope with loneliness, and the house was more friendly. During the validation, participants were interested and engaged in various functions of the system. Their favourite option was ''cognitive games''. The reminders of medicines and appointments were also used on a regular basis, much like the dietary advice and healthy tips. The project confirmed that the TIAGo robot was real support for the participants, i.a. by increasing cognitive, physical and social activity. It also showed that it was essential to observe and monitor validations in the long term to realistically evaluate human-robot interactions, because of the confusion caused by the introduction of the robot.",

Low mobility levels among older inpatients is associated with increased risk of functional decline, institutionalisation and death. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of training volunteers to encourage older inpatients to be more active. Methods: This pre-post study was conducted on acute medical wards for older people, using a mixed methods approach. Inclusion criteria included patients aged C 70 years who were mobile prior to admission. Two physical activity measures were used: the StepWatch Activity Monitor and GENEActiv. Volunteers were trained to deliver twice daily activity sessions which consisted of mobility and/or bedside exercises. Nurses, therapists, volunteers and patients were interviewed to determine the acceptability of the intervention. Results: 50 participants were recruited pre-intervention (mean age 87 years, SD 4.6), with a median daily step count of 626 (IQR 298-1468) and mean daily acceleration of 9.1 milligravity (SD 3.3).",

In the field of geriatric medicine, it has been shown that explicit criteria for PIPs increase the appropriateness of prescriptions. A recent systematic review showed that explicit definitions of antibiotic-PIPs in older people have not previously been listed. Our objective was to develop explicit definitions of antibiotic-PIPs for older hospitalized patients. Method: We performed a qualitative study in accordance with the COREQ criteria (Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research), through focus groups involving French geriatricians and infectiologists. Audio recordings were transcribed then analyzed by two reviewers. Mentions related to explicit definitions were extracted and rephrased in definitions, which were classified according to the type of inappropriateness. The resulting list was corrected by an independent expert group and then validated by the whole focus groups participants. Results: Four focus groups involved 28 stakeholders; 22 (78.6%) had an antimicrobial stewardship activity. The analysis identified 96 explicit definitions: 63 (65.6%) corresponded to inappropriate choice of antibiotic, 17 (17.7%) to inappropriate use and 16 (16.7%) to overuse of antibiotics. Conclusion: Our study provides explicit definitions of antibiotic-PIPs, especially for older patients and public health challenges. This list will be refined through a Delphi survey to reach a consensus, which could deliver key messages for prescribers and open up new perspectives for the analysis of electronic healthcare databases to reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions.",

            "text": "There is a need for healthcare policy coordination for various reasons. First, to scale up on-going innovative solutions adapted to a regional context to make sure as many people as possible can benefit from high value care services. Second, to reduce budgetary costs for Long-Term-Care (LTC) for elders at both regional and local level. This could get shaped by a sustainable funding model of social care whereby the finance of it is cut all over Europe, anchored to the organizational model at community scale, to assure the delivery of care in a sustainable manner, integrated into the administrative and institutional LTC setting of a region. This study proposal is inspired by the study ''Greece 2020'' suggesting a Greek National Strategy for Integrated Elderly LTC in Greece as opposed to in-hospital episodebased care, one of the 6 Rising Stars for Gross Domestic Product rise until the year 2020. This, however, is a challenge for most of the European Regions today specially in remote areas and in those EU countries with continuous cuts in social care. The research question: The primary research question at hand is: what is the potential of an innovative funding of ''Design-for-All Integrated LTC model'', to replace state and public LTC funding in EU Regions under economic crisis? The secondary research question is: How responsive is such a model to induce change in planning, organizing and funding LTC, in one pilot area of Greece? This pilot area is characterized by a reverse availability ratio of budgetary resources to the rising needs of elderly care in a co-morbidity context of an ageing population and a directly relevant ratio to the availability of resources to allow the necessary income to fund this LTC model. The current study will investigate what resources dispose some of the regions of Greece to create robust silver tourism services and products to fund a LTC model according to the needs of the pilot areas and what are the changes they should adopt, in organizational and LTC financing terms, to allow for cashable savings that would guarantee Return on Investment (RoI) and sustainability of the LTC provision at community level. A large part of this exercise concerns the mentality shift induced to the local actors to understand and endorse innovative funding in long term care run by own resources and not state funded. Study objectives: The main study objective is to assess the assets and needs for LTC in the selected Greek region and to construct a model that could sustainably finance LTC provision in the pilot area, via income generation from local economic growth, reinvested to fund LTC provision. The second objective is to observe the responsiveness of this model and how change in healthcare organization and funding is perceived by local authorities and how susceptible they are to that change. The specific objectives of this study are: (1) to map resources for local economic growth and the needs for elderly LTC of the selected municipality (pilot area); (2) to assess the costs and resources for the elderly LTC services integration in the area, the human and other resource capacity, the skills and needs for the LTC provision in relation to products or services (i.e. tourism) that would generate income from that model and guarantee the cashable savings of the investment return to sustain LTC provision. (3) Observation of the responsiveness of the model throughout the data collection and analysis and model preparation. Results: Initiating a innovative LTC financing model through Social Impact Investment in LMIC, requires the cooperation of all local actors and a consensus in revealing, valuating, and putting the income generated from the local resource at the service of public health through non profit trade and investment activities. The main obstacle was unawareness of innovation procedures in health financing that created reservation to express interest in the model of the present study, combined with a generally low developmental capacity of the municipal actors so as to exercise control over the assets of their community. Where this was the case, the local governor was not stronger from private interests that preferred to see the resource procured for profit making actions away from redistribution of the RoI at the service of public health, in this case long term care. On the contrary, where the municipality had prior experience from innovation procedures and had concluded successfully in the past such operations and business activities around the new models of care, the response was better and the commitment in the new learning process higher. In addition the cooperation with the private sector was managed in an inclusive way that streamlined RoI to public health purposes through the proposed model of this study. Education and awareness of LGAs in innovative LTC financing and organization procedures of new care models, are key for the local authorities to adopt change, since chronic care is primarily organized at community based level.",

One patient suffered from a previous endoscopic colonic perforation and was now readmitted for worsening anemia under oral anticoagulation due to atrial fibrillation. The second had unexplained iron deficiency and anemia for [ 1 year . Results: In both women on bidirectional endoscopy including capsule endoscopy no bleeding stigmata were identified. Iron resorption was normal. Endoscopic biopsies from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract did show typical Congo-red staining in the perivascular submucosa.

Symptomatic therapy is restricted to blood transfusion and iron supplementation. While amyloid deposits in the gastrointestinal tract lead to occult bleeding anticoagulation was stopped in the first patient. Conclusions: Although a rare manifestation of amyloidosis, staining for amyloid should be considered in elder patients undergoing gastrointestinal biopsy who have unexplained iron deficiency with anemia. Further diagnostic examination should focus on the type of amyloidosis. Therapy directs against the underlying cause or remains symptomatic in case of senile ATTR-Amyloid. Once a definitive diagnosis is made no repeat endoscopic exams should be performed given the high perforation risk in this patient cohort. Oral anticoagulation is relatively contraindicated.",

After exclusion of autoimmune and drug-induced hemolysis we found a primary infection with parvovirus B19 (positive IgM). Jaundice and hemolysis disappeared spontaneously. The hematomas were explained by an overdosing of phenprocoumon, subscribed for atrial fibrillation 3 years ago, following a higher absorption due to previous fasting and inappetence.

Case description: A 84 year old man presented to the hospital after a fall at home. He had a history of arterial hypertension and Parkinson disease and was treated with acetylsalicylic acid, levodopa and carbidopa. He had a Glasgow coma scale 15 and a nasal trauma with active bleeding and bone exposure. Cervical X-ray showed C4-C5 luxation and fracture of C5-C6 spinous processes, confirmed by CT scan. Four hours later the patient suddenly developed dyspnea and stridor progressing to cardiac arrest due to airway obstruction with blood. After 3 min cardiopulmonary resuscitation the patient was stabilized and admitted to the intensive care unit. One week later he underwent spinal surgery, after which he developed Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia, successfully treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. He was discharged 2 months later with a rehabilitation program. On follow-up evaluation 6 months after the fall the patient has quadriplegia and dysphagia. Surgical drainage of the epidural empyema was performed as well as knee arthrocentesis. The patient was given vancomicin and gentamicin for 6 weeks with clinical improvement and was discharged 3 months later. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from three blood cultures, knee pus and epidural pus culture. Key conclusions: Successful treatment of subdural empyema usually requires a drainage procedure and antibiotic therapy for 6-8 weeks.",

On physical exam, he developed vesiculo-ulcerative lesions; extremely tender, hemorrhagic. The lesions were around perioral cutaneous tissue, vermillion border, buccal mucosa, gingiva, soft/hard palate, pharynx and tongue. Serum HSV-1 IgG antibody was [ 58 index and HSV-1 DNA level was 5043 copies/mL. He was managed with two weeks of IV acyclovir. As a result of a poor appetite due to excruciating pain in the oropharynx he required a gastrostomy tube feeding. The patient was discharged from hospital after clinical improvement. Discussion: Immunocompromised patients usually have atypical presentations [4] : more aggressive, extensive, slower healing painful lesions and prolonged infection leading to dissemination. Severe HSV gingivostomatitis leads to significant morbidity [4] , perhaps increased mortality in a previously immunocompetent elderly patient. To date no data studying use of prophylactic acyclovir in critically ill immunocompetent elderly patients (ie: comparing acyclovir prophylaxis vs wait-and-see strategy) [3] . Conclusion: Elderly patients with a critical illness who are seropositive for HSV might benefit from pre-emptive acyclovir.

Methods Hence, a QIA visioning a safe, patient-centric discharge, to improve overall communication amongst teams; with a primary aim to improve discharges before 11.30 am and 30-day readmission rate, without an increase in mortality and average length of stay (ALOS), was conceived and implemented in our GRM ward; aided by Daily board ward round Introduction: Back pain is a common cause to attend the Emergency Department in elderly people. The differential diagnosis is varied, with a spectrum of pathologies of major and minor severity. Case report: A 68-year-old men was admitted due to two days history of constant left back pain, with increasing intensity and irradiation to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. On physical examination he had no fever, was hemodynamically stable, with pain at the deep palpation of the left hypochondrium. Blood workup revealed leukocytosis (15.7 9 10 4 G/L) and lactate dehydrogenase elevation (585 U/L). Chest X-ray showed left pulmonary base hypotransparency. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a splenic nodular mass, heterogeneous, with 10 cm and, left pleural effusion.

In conclusion, this case emphasises the need to thoroughly assess the often multifactorial aetiology of anaemia in elderly patients and highlights that autoimmune disease may manifests for the first time in this age group.

It typically represents less than 2% of upper gastrointestinal bleeds, normally found in the lesser curvature of the stomach. Hematemesis and melena were the most common presenting symptoms. Gastroscopy being the main diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Some case series have shown an increased incidence in men aged between 60 to 80 years. Case report: A 94 years old man, admitted to an acute geriatric unit with moderate-severe disability affecting activity of daily living, diabetic with retinopathy, iron-deficiency anemia since 2009 with normal endoscopic study, atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation therapy and taking 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid per day. Presented to hospital because of 3 episodes of haematemesis, tachycardia, hypotension and hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (regular of 11 g/dL) that required one blood transfusion. A gastroscopy was performed and showed a 5 mm vascular lesion without bleeding on the greater curvature. The patient received a combined therapy of 3 hemoclips hemostasis and adrenaline injection that was successful, 48 h later he started oral tolerance with no incidences. Conclusion: DL should be part of differential diagnosis in chronic iron-deficiency anemia and gastrointestinal bleeding with no-lesion endoscopic studio. Identifying the site of bleeding by endoscopy may be difficult, because of this it is not easy to visualize low dimension of mucosa break in the context of a large amount of blood or if the bleeding stops. Non-pathogenetic association between NSAIDs and DL has been identified in literature. Endoscopy combined therapy (pharmacological and hemoclips) could be the most effective method for the stopping of bleeding.",

Methods: Patients aged 75 years and older (75 +) admitted to the ED of the University Hospital of Cologne were consecutively screened over a 3-month period for enrolment in the study. On admission, patients underwent physical and instrumental examination as well as CGA-based calculation of the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) and a questionnaire on QoL (EQ5D). Healthcare indicators were collected at baseline as well as at a phone-follow up interview three and 6 months after discharge.

NIV may represent a possible treatment strategy in older patients, but no studies explored the usefulness of the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) in predicting the NIV outcomes. Aim: Evaluate the accuracy of CGA-based MPI to predict NIV outcome Methods: we enrolled patients older than 75 years, admitted to an Acute Geriatrics Unit for AHRF (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \\ 300) and treated with NIV plus standard medical therapy. MPI was assessed at admission according to standard methods. The primary outcome was 1 year-mortality rate; secondary outcomes were NIV success, i.e. improving the oxygenation index (OI, PO 2 /FiO 2 ratio C 300) and the days of OI improvement. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to identify the best MPI cut-off to predict mortality in this population (MPI C 0.78). Results: We enrolled 15 patients (10 females, mean age 86.7 \u00b1 5.2 years, mean MPI 0.75 \u00b1 SD), 8 with MPI C 0.78 and 7 with MPI \\ 0.78. At baseline, no differences in arterial blood parameters were observed. MPI values C 0.78 (p \\ 0.05) and NIV failure (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with 1-year mortality. NIV success was significantly higher in patients with lower MPI (p \\ 0.05), regardless of basal PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio. In NIV success group patients with MPI \\ 0.78 improved OI in fewer days (4 vs 8 days, p = 0.06). Conclusion: In frail older patients with AHRF, MPI predicts 1-year mortality and NIV success, in terms of OI improvement and the time of OI improvement.

Conclusion: Epinephrine autoinjectors should be prescribed for all patients with a history of anaphylaxis. Patients and their caregivers should be taught why, when, and how to inject adrenaline and should be equipped with a personalized written anaphylaxis emergency action plan. History of allergic reactions and anaphylaxis besides an emergency action plan should be noted in patient records in nonhospital care settings such as nursing homes and epinephrine should always be available. Further education of clinicians regarding the appropriate route of epinephrine administration in the management of anaphylaxis should be promoted to avoid adverse events. Its use should be promoted among clinicians in every setting.",

Aim: examine whether patients discharged directly to their home from the Emergency Department (ED) and followed-up by either a geriatric team or a general practitioner have a better functional capacity when measured 8 weeks after admission compared to those who were admitted to a geriatric ward. Methods: Community-dwelling 75+ years old patients were consecutively enrolled on admission to the ED. A physiotherapist assessed the functional capacity by Functional Recovery Score (FRS) retrospectively 14 days before current illness and prospectively 8 weeks after discharge. Changes in functional capacity were compared in a logistic regression model. Results: A total of 157 patients were included. Fifty-eight patients (36.9%) were discharged directly to their homes and 99 (63.1%) were admitted to a hospital ward. The two groups were comparable in gender, age, comorbidity, previous functional capacity, mental status. Fifty-four percent of the patients who were discharged directly to their homes had either maintained or improved their functional capacity compared to only 36% in the group admitted to a hospital ward. Adjusted for baseline characteristics: [OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.05; 4.09)], p = 0.036. Conclusion: Patients discharged directly to their homes from the ED may be more active and return sooner to their activities of daily living. It is important to aim at a physically active hospitalization to prevent in-hospital functional decline. And if possible, discharge the patients early and treat them at home.",

They visit the Emergency Department more frequently, with more urgent diseases, need more diagnostics and stay longer. Furthermore, they have a greater chance of being hospitalised and being misdiagnosed. The acute medical problems of older people are often similar to those of younger adults but the presentation can be atypical or there can be a number of co-existing problems that make diagnosis difficult. Further difficulties occur in frailer, older adults who continue to manage at home despite the effects of increasing age and multiple medical problems. In these patients an apparently minor illness can lead to deterioration in a non-specific manner leading to immobility, a fall, or acute confusion and they need a more specific triage and a screening program for older ED patients. The social circumstances and the availability of social support may be of greater importance than the management of the medical illness. In the elderly, many common conditions can exist without their characteristic features. Instead, the elderly may have more than one nonspecific geriatric syndromes (eg, delirium, dizziness, syncope, falling, weight loss, incontinence, abdominal pain). These syndromes result from multiple disorders and impairments; nonetheless, patients may improve when only some of the precipitating factors are corrected. An even better strategy is to identify risk factors for these syndromes and correct as many as possible.",

This study aim is to report the crude prevalence of mild to major NCD in a clinical cohort of older adults with mild to moderate CKD (stages 3-4) and diabetes. Results: Upon neuropsychological assessment and application of DSM-V criteria, 86/178 (48%) of the cohort had a NCD ranging from mild (n = 49) to major symptoms (n = 37). Neuropsychological predictors for mild or major NCD entered into a stepwise regression analysis found that Fluency and Memory impairment accounted for over 66% of the variance, p \\ 0.0001. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first study in the UK to report that cognitive changes occur in a significant number of older adults with CKD and concomitant diabetes.

The aim is to explore these features. Methods: FINALEX (randomized-controlled-trial) included 194 Alzheimer disease (AD) persons, of which two-thirds participated in exercise intervention 1 h twice weekly for 12 months. We investigated fall-risk factors (diseases, fall-related-drugs, physical functioning) and possible interaction between exercise and fall-related-drugs. Results: Of 355 falls (altogether) 123 led to injuries, 50 to Emergency Department visits, and 13 to fractures. Stumbling (n = 61) was the most common reason for falling. The persons with 1 (n = 34) or C 2 falls (n = 57) were older and had more severe dementia than those without falls (n = 103). Good nutritional status and physical functioning protected against falls whereas fall history, osteoarthritis, and diabetes increased fall-risk. We compared the fall-risk associated with fall-related-drugs between intervention and control groups: There was no difference in the number of falls among those without antihypertensives or psychotropics between intervention and control groups. In intervention group with antihypertensives, the IRR was 0.5 falls/ person-year (95% CI 0.4-0.6); among controls the IRR was 1.5 falls/ person-year (95% CI 1.2-1.8) (p \\ 0.001 for group, p = 0.067 for medication, p \\ 0.001 for interaction). Among participants using psychotropics the intervention group had an IRR of 0.7 falls/personyear (95% CI 0.6-0.9); the IRR for the control group was 2.0 falls/ person-year (95% CI 1.6-2.5) (p \\ 0.001 for group, p = 0.071 for medication, p \\ 0.001 for interaction).",

Alternate Bilateral Stimulations (ABS) induced by EMDR allow desensitization of traumatic information and reprocessing of associated memory. Currently, the EMDR does not have enough experimental data concerning the elderly person. Our research aims to establish a link between trauma symptomatology and behavioral symptomatology in neurocognitive pathologies. Verbal agitation and anxiety are found in both neurocognitive pathology [1] and also in PTSD. Amano et al. [2] are the pioneers of research in the field of EMDR and neurocognitive pathologies. According to the authors, behavioral disorders are directly related to past events that replay themselves here unless the psychic scene of the subject. Although the results are encouraging the study has only 3 subjects. We wish to demonstrate that it is possible to reduce verbal agitation by adapting the EMDR protocol. Method: 8 subjects in nusery home with verbal agitation (DSMV criteria for major cognitive impairment). At first we will assess primary needs (first source of verbal agitation). We have chosen 2 groups which are randomized (EMDR and Control). We will analyze intensity of verbalizatoons using a sound level meter (fr\u00e9quence duration and intensity) on two repeated sessions. E use some evaluations like NPIES, CMAI, ALGOPLUS, PITTSBURGH, MMSE and statistical analysis of the results. Results: Current research indicates a reduction in verbal agitation for EMDR patients. Key conclusion: According to our first results, we can say that performing ABS in eldery people with cognitive disorders does not induce a healing phenomenon as in PTSD but a soothing of the limbic system and therefore of verbal agitation.",

There is no consensus as to which cognitive screening instrument (CSI) is most suitable for VCI. Objectives: To systematically review the psychometric properties of brief CSIs across the spectrum of VCI from vascular mild cognitive impairment (VMCI) and vascular dementia (VaD). Method: A literature search for all available papers published from inception until 31st May 2018 was conducted using the scholarly databases. Bibliographies of all included studies were also screened for any related studies. The titles and abstract were screened and the studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were thoroughly reviewed.

It affects men and women equally in the sixth to seventh decade of life with a 3-12% increasing incidence in elderly [1] . Case presentation: An 89 year-old woman with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, legal blindness, gait disturbances, urinary incontinence, presents with 1 year of short term memory impairment, suicidal ideations. On neuropsychiatric evaluation the patient demonstrated deficiencies in the following: executive: information processing speed, attention, working memory, learning, retention, orientation, semantic fluency, executive systems; MMSE 9/25; sensory: impaired visual acuity, bradykinesia, mild motor programming deficits, gait ataxia; psychiatric: generalized anxiety, depression. Discussion: Binswanger Disease is a subtype of vascular dementia which is an underrecognized gradually progressive demyelinating disease resulting in subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. It overlaps with other neuropathologies thus history and imaging is essential [1, 3, 6] . The disease is associated with hypertension (98% of cases) and lacunar infarctions [1] . CT brain demonstrates periventricular lucencies (hypodense); MRI brain shows hyperintense white matter abnormalities from fronto-temporal region to the centrum semiovale [1, 3] . Treatment is primarily supportive: discussions on advanced directives such as goals of care, social support and antidepressant therapy, etc. Management of hypertension and aspirin prophylaxis may help slow progression. Conclusion: Binswanger Disease is an underrecognized disease resulting in subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. It is important to recognize this entity as disease management will be different from other forms of neurodegenerative dementias. ",

However, studies are increasingly focusing on prescribing for people with advanced dementia. The PEACE program, in particular, has produced criteria that show promise in identifying potentially inappropriate medications in advanced dementia, including anticholinesterase inhibitors and lipid-lowering agents. Potential benefits of deprescribing are widespread, including health and quality of life benefits to patients and cost benefits to the health care system. Challenges to successfully discontinuing medications include patient-, clinician-, and system-related barriers. Limited life expectancy and cognitive impairment appear to be the most important factors driving deprescribing. Being an essential issue, deprescribing should be part of the medical curriculum and throughout the career of senior clinicians. Key conclusions: Evidence supporting the benefits and safety of deprescribing in the elderly continues to grow, strengthening the cause for greater integration of regular deprescribing into medical culture. More evidence about deprescribing in advanced dementia is needed. Advance care planning is the cornerstone of high-quality palliative care in advance dementia and deprescribing should be part of that process.",

ASA is a poor known putative risk factor for cardioembolism. Its prevalence in the general population is 2.2%. We report a case of a 77 years old woman who came to our attention for progressive cognitive impairment. Symptoms were primarily loss of short-term memory and apathy, but was also reported an episode of walking disorder and one of misidentification of her husband. Medical history included only hypertension. Neurological examination was negative, while cardiac examination revealed a mesocardial heart murmur. Mini Mental State Examination score was 15.7/30. Basal and instrumental activities of daily living were also inadequate. Carotids ultrasonography and electrocardiogram were negative. The patient underwent to a cerebral tomography that founded chronic cerebrovascular disease with evidence of little ischemic strokes. A subsequent echocardiogram revealed the presence of an ASA. Our diagnosis was of vascular dementia as a result of repeated ischemic stroke caused by ASA presence. The patient is waiting to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram. To best of our knowledge this is the second case reported in literature of vascular dementia as result of ASA presence. This medical condition should be kept in mind for a possible cause of vascular dementia, particularly in the presence of multi-infartual strokes with negative carotids ultrasonography and normal electrocardiogram or in case of unknown cardiac murmur.",

Objectives: Assessment of the level of burden and frequency of depression among caregivers in AD, and identification of the main factors associated with the burden in these caregivers. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study at the psychiatric department. All caregivers who accompanied their relatives with AD to their appointments from 01 November 2016 to 15 January 2017 were invited to take part. We used the Zarit Burden Inventory to assess Beck's burden level in the caregiver. Results: The caregiver was a woman (74%) with a mean age of 46 and cohabiting with the patient in 68% of the cases. The mean score on the burden interview was 43. The burden was perceived as high by 48% of caregivers. A high caregiver burden was significantly associated with the absence of recreational activity (57% vs 83%), being the primary caregiver of the patient (50% vs 83%) and cohabiting with him/her (53% vs 83%). Regarding patient variables, only the level of dependence of the patient correlated with a high level of caregiver burden (38% vs. 79%).

Methods: We followed guidelines for intervention development, which recommend a structured approach considering theory, evidence and practical issues. Data were included from literature reviews, clinician workshops, expert opinion meetings, patient and relative interviews, focus groups with people with dementia and clinicians, a cross-sectional survey of risk factors, a proof-of-concept intervention study, and case studies.

A steering group comprising clinicians, researchers and patient carer and public involvement representatives reviewed and refined the triangulation matrix. Practical consideration of how an intervention could be delivered and implemented were considered from the outset. Results: A multicomponent intervention was designed. The focus is on promoting safe activity rather than risk or prevention of falls. Many information sources were consistent in their recommendations and influenced final intervention. Core elements of the intervention included individually-tailored, dementia-appropriate, balance, strength and dualtask exercises, functional training, and activities aimed at improving environmental access and risk enablement. Delivery of the intervention is through a motivational approach to support communication, adherence and longer term continuation of activity.

Methods: This study was part of the Medication use and Alzheimer's (MEDALZ) cohort.

Introduction: Dysphagia is experienced by people with late stage dementia [1] and is associated with aspiration pneumonia (AP), which is a common cause of death in dementia [2, 3] .Although diet and liquid intake are modified to minimise the risk of AP, appropriateness of medicine formulation is often not considered. Aim: Determine whether medication formulation and dysphagia are associated with incident pneumonia among people living with dementia. Methods: A case-controlled study design nested within those with dementia was conducting using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, which includes primary care data of over 20 million UK patients. Cases had a diagnosis of pneumonia whereas controls did not. There were no age restrictions and patients with pneumonia diagnosis \\ 90 days after dementia diagnosis were excluded. Conditional logistic regression was used for data analysis. Results: The dataset contained 28,671 controls and 7259 cases. An increased risk of developing pneumonia was observed to be associated with dysphagia (odds ratios (OR) 3.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.20-3.98, p \\ 0.001) and liquid formulations (OR 2.37, CI 2.11-2.68, p \\ 0.001).

Conclusions: Patients with dysphagia or prescribed liquid medicines are associated with a greater risk of developing pneumonia. Whilst the relationship between dysphagia and pneumonia is predictable, the relationship with liquid medicines is less intuitive. They may be a proxy for severity of dysphagia.

We plan to investigate if MRI allows quantification of exercise-induced structural and functional plasticity in motor and postural control networks, and if quantitative imaging markers of motor and postural network integrity on pre-intervention MRI predicts treatment response. Methods: We invited 23 people with diagnosed dementia who took part in the PrAISED study to undergo a battery of multi-modal MRI imaging on a 3.0 Tesla GE Discovery MR 750 scanner. We included functional imaging of a virtual reality-based, imagined, walking and obstacle avoidance tasks, and a novel postural instability experience (a stumble). Results: 21 people agreed to take part, and 20 tolerated scanning. Mean age was 76 (range 67-92) years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination was 26/30 (range 19-30). Participants agreed that tolerability was good, and all would be willing to be scanned again. We obtained structural T1-weighted, T2-weighted FLAIR, 3D ASL perfusion, neuromelanin-sensitive T1, Re-fMRI, Rs-fMRI and task fMRI images and diffusion tensor imaging to map white-matter tracts. Initial analysis included correlating fMRI images with MMSE, demonstrating positive correlations with deep brain structures, including those associated with memory, and negative correlations with visual association areas.

Using data from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen-a community-based longitudinal study of aging-we examined the association between the resulting latent indicator of cognitive reserve and clinically-ascertained incident dementia over a nine-year follow-up period, while also considering the interplay between latent reserve and APOE-e4 status.

Predicted latent reserve was entered into a Cox proportional hazard model and a reduced risk of dementia was found in those with moderate and high levels of a latent cognitive reserve indicator (HR 0.65 and 0.35, respectively; both p \\ 0.01). A significant interaction on an additive scale was found between latent reserve and genetic risk of dementia. Dementia risk reduction was similar in both carriers and non-carriers of APOE-e4 allele with high cognitive reserve (HR: 0.26 and 0.24, respectively; p \\ 0.01 for both). Not only is cognitive reserve protective of dementia, but it appears to override the detrimental effects of genetic risk.",

However, it was unclear about how to prepare and support when family member from caregiver turn to surrogate decision maker for people with dementia. Method: An integrative review design was used based on Whittemore and Knafl's study [1] . A review of English and Japanese language publications before 2018 March was conducted. Searched electronic databases included MEDLINE, CINANL, EmBase, PubMed and ICHUSHI, CiNii. Critical appraisal was performed by researchers used MMAT. Results: 46 articles with 8 main types of surrogate decisions were included: Placement, Clinical treatment research, End-of-life, Feeding, Advance directive, Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices, Hemodialysis and others. A total of 3486 surrogates were involved and more than half were women. 9 studies focused on Clinical treatment research shown that who participated was mainly spouse as caregivers, adult children were contrasted. The review conducted the preference, influence, process of surrogates with variety of decision types that explored the evidence for caregivers to preparation and identified the advice for healthcare providers about support and intervention. Conclusions: Family members often care for people with dementia for several years, the more decision need the more burden with caregivers. However, many surrogates face the difficult decision with little professional support. Thus, it is urgently needing to support for caregiver turn to surrogate. The association between cognition and hearing is well known. With regard to the growing number of older persons and the incidence of demential illness the question arises whether hearing rehabilitation might counteract cognitive decline in aging. Since 2016 patients aged 50 or more suffering of severe to profound hearing loss and scheduled for cochlear implantation underwent a computer-based evaluation of neurocognitive functions prior to surgery. The multi modular computer-based test battery (ALAcog) composed of ten different subtests covering short-and long-term memory, processing speed, attention, working memory and inhibition. So far 80 patients (median: 67 yrs) were included. Out of these 33 patients were reassessed 6 months and 20 patients 12 months post implantation. After 6 months cognitive functions increased significantly regarding attention (p \\ .001), delayed recall (p = .03), inhibition (p = .04) and working memory (2back p = .0041; OSPAN-test p = .0077). The benefit of the executive functions was the most remarkable. Results remained mostly stable after 12 months. Only working memory measured by the OSPAN additionally enhanced after one year (p \\ .001). In contrast, long-term memory did not improve earlier than after 12 months (p = .021). In general, improvement was statistically better for subjects with poor baseline results. Cochlear implantation has a positive impact on cognitive abilities mostly on executive functions even in patients with lower preoperative performance. Further studies have to show whether hearing restoration through technical devices has a long-term effect on cognition and might even prevent demential illness.",

The Qmci-TR, MMSE, and MoCA were administered sequentially and alternated by geriatricians experienced in the application of all three tests. Interrater reliability was determined in advance. The Reisberg FAST scale was used to stage cognitive status. Education and age-specific cut-offs were determined for all three screening tests for the normal cognition, aMCI and AD, and their discriminative values were compared. SPSS 18.0 and MedCalc programs were used for statistical analyses. Results: A total of 321 patients (133 with normal cognition, 88 aMCI, 100 AD) were included. Median (min-max) age was 75 (60-98) years. One-quarter (25.1%) had completed high school and above, 65% primary school or lower education levels. Half (51.1%) of the patients were aged 75 years old and over. The Qmci-TR was statistically significantly better than the MoCA in distinguishing between aMCI and AD in the whole sample and for those attaining high school or higher levels of education (AUC 0.833; 0.759 p = 0.004 and AUC 0.918; 0.752 p = 0.04, respectively). In addition, the Qmci-TR and MMSE were superior to the MoCA in discriminating normal cognition from cognitive impairment in the whole sample and in individuals over 75 years of age. Conclusion: This is the first study to compare the discriminative values of a broad selection of short cognitive screening tests in an older Turkish population. In distinguishing between MCI and AD, the Qmci-TR appears to be preferable to the MoCA; it is more sensitive for an older Turkish population and those with more education.",

We therefore need to understand factors that affect processing speed. Persistent depressive symptoms have previously been associated with processing speed decline -this may relate to confounding by a common cause, rather than an aetiological link. This study aimed to establish whether the relationship between depressive symptoms and processing speed is accounted for by cerebrovascular disease or neuroticism. Methods: Participants of the Manchester and Newcastle Study of Age and Cognitive Performance aged over 60 were included. Depressive symptoms were assessed on up to 4 occasions (using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Geriatric Depression Scale). Processing speed was assessed using an alphabet coding task. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and processing speed adjusted for potential confounding factors. Results: 2919 participants were included (mean age 67.49 years). Low levels of depressive symptoms were reported (mean baseline BDI score 7.15). Average depressive symptoms over mean 8.6 years were significantly associated with processing speed (beta = -0.06, p = 0.02). Neither neuroticism (beta = 0.024, p = 0.415) nor cerebrovascular disease (beta = -0.03, p = 0.32) were associated with processing speed. Conclusion: Persistent low-level depressive symptoms in healthy older adults are associated with lower processing speed at follow-up over a mean 8.6-year period. This relationship is not accounted for by neuroticism or cerebrovascular disease. Subclinical depressive symptoms may therefore represent a modifiable target for interventions to promote healthy cognitive ageing.",

Amyloid-b-42 (Ab42), total tau (ttau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are acknowledged biomarkers for conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's disease (AD) [2] . Aim: To investigate correlations between CSF biomarkers and outcomes of I) the mobility test Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) combined with the verbal task of reciting animals (TUGdt), II) the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and III) the Word Fluency Test (WFT). Methods: Eighty-three patients at two memory clinics who had undergone lumbar puncture were included with mean age 71 years (range 50-84). Thirty-one had a dementia diagnosis (22 AD) and 52 had MCI. The number of animals recited during the performance of TUGdt was counted. Spearman's rank correlations adjusted for age, gender and education were used. Results: Significant inverse (p\\0.05) correlations were shown between CSF tau concentrations and I.I) the number of recited animals/10 s during TUGdt (t-tau: R = -0.25, p-tau: R = -0.25), I.II) the total number of animals recited during TUGdt (t-tau: R = -0.26, p-tau: R = -0.27), II) MMSE results (t-tau: R = -0.25, p-tau: R = -0.26), III) WFT results (t-tau: R = -0.24, p-tau: non-significant). CSF Ab42 did not correlate with any of the test results. Conclusions: Correlations between CSF tau and TUGdt performance were found at similar levels as between CSF tau and MMSE among patients with dementia or MCI. This may indicate that TUGdt results could be used as an aid in early identification of neurodegeneration. References: 1.

JAMA Neurol 74 (7) Introduction: Current literature supports that cognitive function and physical performance are associated. Gait is more often evaluated on a straight walkway. F8WT, involving straight and curved walking to walk a figure-of-8 around two cones, might challenge cognitive function. Our aim was to assess the relationship between physical and cognitive function (specifically executive function) using different physical performance tests in community-dwelling older adults with cognitive impairment. Key conclusions: Our findings support an association between executive function and GS, but traditional linear physical performance measures appear superior to more challenging tasks. We hypothesize that F8WT might be more influenced by gait impairments because of the curved pathway. Hence, we need future research with larger study samples to better investigate this aspect.",

Aim of our study is, to validate the Turkish version Rowland Universal Dementia Scale (RUDAS). Methods: 140 patients over 65 years of age (70 control/70 mild dementia) were included. Power of cohort was over 80%. Diagnosis was supported by DSM V criteria in all patients. In 79 patients neuropsychometric tests were applied. RUDAS, was translated into Turkish, applied by the researcher. RUDAS was applied in 2 days to determine test-retest reliability. Results were compared with MMSE; reliability, validity, statistical values, factors affecting the results were determined. Results: Cohorts were distributed homogenously. Time validity was verified. MMSE was correlated wtih results of RUDAS with 45,3% in control, 73% in dementia group. Test was applied approximately in 5 min. Factor weights varied 0.44-0.81 and construct was verified as 6 item scoring system. When 25 was cut-off point, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV were as follows respectively, 92.86%, 92.86%, 92.9%; 92.9%. Content validity index was determined by 7 specialists as 100%. Cronbach's alpha was 0.692, Test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.987) was determined. Results were not affected by educational, immigrant status, language used; however age, gender have significant effect. Conclusion: As a result of increased migration trend, screening tests became less reliable. Our study showed, Turkish version of RUDAS is valid, reliable that could be used in mild dementia patients from diverse populations while education, immigrant status, preferred language have no effect on results. Together with the diagnosis dementia, many things in daily life change or will change quickly. These changes might lead to issues you would like to discuss together to anticipate, but are sometimes difficult to discuss (e.g. cooking, personal hygiene, inheritance, and preferences for future care). In order to support people in having these conversations, the Dutch application Roodkapje (Little red riding hood) was developed. Roodkapje is a so called gamified application that is designed as a conversation facilitator for people with dementia and their informal carers. Grandmother comes across different topics, depicted in such a manner that players are encouraged to reflect and start the conversation on their own situation. Roodkapje was developed in collaboration with older persons and their relatives, both with and without dementia. The development process of applications as this is often complex, that is why we would like to share our learned lessons regarding content production, usability testing and app development. We used literature, surveys, and a focus group to collect the most important and difficult to discuss issues. During the development process older adults played prototypes of the game in order to provide us with feedback on user friendliness and use of the game as conversation facilitator. This feedback gave us insight on how to develop an application for older adults with dementia; we started the app as a serious game, but this did not fit the target audience. The current application is an interactive tool to facilitate conversations on changes due to dementia.",

Little is known about QoL before diagnosis, at the beginning of care process. Our goal was to study the influence of memory problems perceptions on QoL in people expressing memory complaints before diagnosis (at the first visit at a Memory Clinic).

One hundred fifty six persons expressing memory complaints were recruited at the Memory Clinic of the University Hospital of Nancy, France (mean age: 73 years; sex ratio: 99 female). Correlation Analysis, mean comparisons and regressions were carried out. Results show that, in a population expressing memory complaints without diagnosis, QoL does not seem to be influenced by anxiety, depression or cognitive decline. However, negative perceptions of memory disorders, such as a low personal control on memory loss, affect QoL, especially for social domains: if an individual thinks he cannot control his memory problems, then he will be less committed with his social life. Given the importance of social activities in maintaining cognitive abilities and quality of life, providing advises and mnemonic techniques in psychoeducational intervention could improve control on memory problems and reduce the risk of social withdrawal.",

There are three memory clinics, many day-care-centers offering respite care as well as increasing dementia specialisation of homecare services (Spitex). In 2008 the new service Home-visit SiL was launched. A team of specialised nurses provides a diagnostic assessment and specific counselling at the people's homes. They offer case-management and organize care for patients without a close social net. The goal of this service is to help people with dementia to stay longer at home. Appropriate outpatient services should delay the nursing home admission. This study measured the state of dementia and other data at patient's admission to two nursing homes in Zurich and compares it with data of RAI-NH Background: In Ireland, Persons living with dementia (PlwD) account for approximately 25% of acute hospital admissions. Acute care services are often fragmented with little integration between inhouse teams, ambulatory or community services, resulting in poorer care outcomes for PlwD, including deskilling and re-admissions. This project developed a person-centred integrated Dementia care pathway (IDCP) for PlwD availing of services. The pathway was developed over a 3-year period (2015-2017) and was governed by a consortium of key stakeholders. Method: Using Quality Improvement methodology and PDSA cycles, project activities were supported by the development of a Memory Assessment and Support Hub, accessed from various entry points on the pathway. Activity evaluation consisted of data capture and review, interviews, focus groups and clinical audit. Findings: Pathway activities focused on: dementia identification/diagnosis (n = 376 new diagnosis), (n = 1006 assessments/reviews), (n = 1250 signposting/post diagnostic supports), crisis intervention/ appropriate acute hospital avoidance (n = 181), enhanced inpatient care (n = 1013 assessment/reviews), (n = 73 Dementia/Delirium Care Bundle (DDCB)), supported discharge (n = 372), and targeted staff education (n = 902).

Objective: The study objective was to evaluate immediate and longterm transferability of DT performances in PWD. Methods: Multi-morbid, older PWD (n = 105) were included in a 10-week randomized, controlled trial with the intervention group (IG) performing a DT-based training ('Walking and Counting') while the control group (CG) performed unspecific, low-intensity exercises. DT-performance was measured under 3 conditions: 'Walking and Counting' (trained), 'Walking and Verbal Fluency' (semi-trained) and 'Strength and Verbal Fluency' (untrained). Motor and cognitive performance was documented as single-task (ST) and DT at baseline (T1) after training (T2) and at follow up (T3). Results: The trained DT 'Walking and Counting' was significantly improved for motor performances (p \\ 0.001-0.011, effect sizes as partial eta squared g 2 = 0.071-0.249) as well as cognitive performances (p \\ 0.001-0.047, g 2 = 0.044-0.295).

We aimed to evaluate postural stability, gait and balance with clinical and laboratory balance tests in Global Deterioration Scale Stage 4 and 5 Alzheimer's disease patients and compare with cognitively normal patients. Methods: We recruited 37 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 21 cognitively normal older people. Individuals with advanced stage dementia, hearing problems, severe arthritis, history of surgery in previous month, Parkinson's disease, stroke sequel, and major depression were excluded. Comprehensive geriatric assessment, Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up&Go Test were performed to all participants. Fall history in previous year and blood tests results in the previous month were recorded. Walk across (WA), sit to stand (STS), tandem walk (TW) and step quick turn (SQT) tests were applied to all participants using computerized posturography, NeuroCom Balance Master (2011). SPSS 21.0 programme was used for statistical analysis. Results: Mean age was 76\u00b15 vs. 73\u00b14 years in AD and control groups, respectively. Twenty two of the AD patients and 12 of the controls were female. The walking speeds in WA and TW tests were slower in AD patients than the controls (p = 0.005 and \\ 0.001). WA-step width increased (p = 0.034) and WA-step length decreased (p = 0.006) in the AD group. SQT-sway increased (p = 0.017) and SQT-time increased (p \\ 0.001) in patients with AD. Regression analysis including age, vitamin B12, WA-step length, WA-step width, WA-speed, STS-sway velocity, SQT-turn sway, SQT-turn time, and TW-speed parameters showed that WA-step length (OR = 1.05, %95 CI 1.009-1.110, p = 0.02), SQT-turn sway (OR = 0.95, % 95 CI 0.910-0.998, p = 0.04), SQT-turn time (OR = 0.33, %95 CI 0.148-0.766, p = 0.01), STS-sway velocity (OR = 0.45, %95 CI 0.219-0.963, p = 0.04), and TW-speed (OR = 1.14, %95 CI 1.024-1.267, p = 0.01) were independently associated with Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion: Slower walking speed, higher turn sway and time show that patients with AD may have increased risk of falls risk even in early stages. The parameters associated with Alzheimer's disease independently from vitamin B12 levels and age may cause this outcome.",

At M2, poor performers reported a lower PUFA and Vit B9 intake, whereas good performers recorded a significative reduction in calcium, Vit E and several B vitamins intake. Overall, good performers stated a larger number of significant decreases. Conclusion: These findings suggest that food patterns might be a better predictive factor of the cognitive performance than a set of nutrients. Introduction: The use of benzodiazepines and related drugs (BZDRs) and opioids has been associated with serious risks in older persons, especially in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the prevalence and associated factors of concomitant use of these drugs among older people with or without AD. A shorter duration of concomitant use (1-89 days) revealed similar results, N = 3821; 15.6% and N = 3008; 10.6%, respectively. Prolonged concomitant use of BZDRs and opioids was associated with female sex, low socioeconomic position, most of the common comorbidities and history of substance abuse or long-term benzodiazepine use. The most commonly used combinations were Z-drug (31.7%) or benzodiazepine (29.9%) with a weak opioid. Key conclusions: Despite the recommendations and risks, the prevalence of concomitant BZDR and opioid use was common in older persons with or without AD. It is important to develop strategies to reduce unnecessary concomitant use of these drugs.",

Only patients without pre-fracture diagnosis of cognitive disorder were included (n = 831). The patients underwent a comprehensive geriatric outpatient assessment 4-6 months post-hip fracture with diagnostic investigations of cognitive disorders based on the 2010 update of the National Care Guideline including internationally accepted diagnostic criteria. Data on diagnostic investigations and diagnoses were extracted manually from the electronic patient files by the research physician (RJ). Results: Of the patients, 238 (28.6%) had died before diagnostic investigation. A cognitive disorder was diagnosed in 184 (22.1%) patients. Of these, Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 79, 42.9%), vascular cognitive impairment (VCI, n = 23, 12.5%) and mixed type (AD + VCI, n = 73, 39.7%) were the most common diagnoses. Less common cases were also identified (Lewy body disease, dementia with Parkinson's disease, alcohol-induced dementia, Fahr's disease, ALS dementia; n = 9, 4.9%). At the two-year time-point diagnostic examinations were still ongoing in 52 patients (6.3%).",

Therefore it is important to attempt to implement new effective and efficient health care interventions that increase independence and well-being of patients with dementia and decrease care giver burden resulting in a more efficient use of scarce health care resources (Baker et al. 2004) . In response, a cognitive rehabilitation programme was developed to potentially improve quality of life, cognitive ability and functional performance of meaningful occupations and activities for patients with dementia S252 Eur Geriatr Med (2018) 9 (Suppl 1):S1-S367 Nottingham University Hospitals, UK Introduction: Carer strain is associated with increased risk of carer depression and social isolation and institutionalisation of the care recipient. Activities of daily living (ADL) are impaired across all stages of dementia, and advanced ADL are argued to be impaired in MCI. People with greater ADL impairment may require more support, which could increase carer strain. This study aimed to assess the relationship between ADL and carer strain in people with dementia and MCI. Methods: Carers assessed caring-related strain and patient's ADL, as part of a baseline assessment of the Promoting Activity Independence and Stability in Dementia (PrAISED) study. The relationship between ADL and carer strain was explored using hierarchal linear regression. Carer gender and age, co-residency and spousal status, were entered in step 1, as evidence suggests these factors are associated with carer strain. ADL was entered in step 2.",

It's usually induced by neuroleptics, in most cases after the first or second week or even more days after the start of treatment. It can also occur after a dose increase. A frequent accompanying clinical picture is insomnia. The treatment in the first instance consists of the withdrawal or reduction of the dose of the neuroleptic. The drugs more used for the treatment are propranolol and benzodiazepines. Method: We present the case of an 83-year-old patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia GDS6 in treatment with memantine 20 mg: 1/24 h, pregabalin 25 mg: 1 / 12 h and quetiapine 100 mg: 1/8 h. His family reports that for several weeks and coinciding with a rise in the dose of quetiapine, the patient is more anxious and doesn't stop moving throughout the day. Clinical exploration highlights psychomotor restlessness, change of position and balance of both lower extremities. Given the medical, pharmacological and clinical examination history, the patient is diagnosed with acute akathisia due to neuroleptics. Quetiapine descent starts to take quetiapine 25 mg: 1/2 every 8 h, increase of pregabalin to take pregabalin 100 mg: 1/12 h. Propanolol is added to the treatment 10 mg: 1/2 every 8 h and clonazepam 0.5: 1/2 when he goes to sleep. Results: After one month, he attended the review accompanied by his family, who reported an important improvement in the clinical picture. The patient remains calm throughout the day and without disorders of the sleep. Key conclusions: The dose adjustment of the neuroleptic with the treatment with propranolol was shown to be effective in a patient with acute akathisia due to neuroleptics. This same conclusion has been revealed by other authors in similar clinical cases.",

Based on the presented background, the previously stated mission statement for dental care for elderly people with dementia is representative of the current position of JSG. Furthermore, JSG started to create the dental treatment guidelines for elderly peoples with dementia from 2016. The contents of the guidelines will be in accordance with the existing ''Providing health care and long-term care services in a timely and appropriate manner as the stages of dementia progress'' shown in the Japanese Dementia Strategy (New Orange Plan).

Considering the limited effectiveness of drugs treatments in cognitive disorders, the emergence of non-invasive techniques could be of benefit to patients. Among these techniques, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can modulate cortical excitability and have therapeutic effects on cognition and behavior. These effects are due to physiological modifications in the stimulated cortical tissue and their associated circuits, depending on the stimulation parameters.",

Despite the difficulties to realize them, studies are getting more and more accurate and controlled. Methods: 110 patients were included, C 60 years old, with diagnosis of mild and very mild cognitive impairment from the Centro de Deterioro Cognitivo in Madrid.

While the burden of EOD is likely to grow due to the ageing of the baby boomer generation, its epidemiology remains poorly characterized. We estimated prevalence and incidence rates of EOD in France. Using the French national health data system, we identified all dementia cases aged 40-64 years, affiliated to the main health insurance fund, and alive at the end of December 2016. Due to the low sensitivity of administrative data to identify EOD, criteria (anti-dementia drugs consumption, hospitalization or benefits for chronic diseases with an ICD10 dementia code) were searched over 5 years (2012-2016) . Incident cases were those identified in 2016 but not in 2015. Age-and sex-specific prevalence and incidence rates of EOD were estimated; we compared age-adjusted rates by sex using Poisson regression. A total of 26,874 prevalent (prevalence = 159/100,000) and 6521 incident (incidence = 38.6/100,000 person-years) cases of EOD were identified. Both prevalence and incidence rates sharply increased with age between 40 and 65 years. Age-adjusted prevalence and incidence rates were lower in women than men (prevalence rate ratio = 0.70, 95% CI 0.68-0.72; incidence rate ratio = 0.65, 95% CI 0.6-0.68).Our findings are consistent with those from a small number of studies that provided data on EOD frequency in the general population. Previous work shows that the underestimation of dementia frequency using administrative databases is likely to be less important for EOD. Based on these figures, we extrapolate that there were about 37,000 cases of EOD in France in 2016, including 9000 incident cases.",

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides direct representation of pathophysiological changes occurring in the central nervous system, and CSF biomarkers have proven to be useful for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Preclinical work using mouse models would be useful to explore novel CSF biomarkers; however, detailed characterization of CSF proteins has been challenging due to the difficulty in collecting large amount of CSF from mice. Here, we developed a novel technique that allows consistent recovery of CSF in the awake, freely behaving mouse. A small incision was made on the posterior atlantooccipital membrane and a collecting tube was placed and fixed on the surface of the posterior atlantooccipital membrane that CSF can be drawn via the small hole. We were able to collect large volume of high-quality CSF from the same animal over time. Contamination of brain tissue or blood, which could potentially affect biomarker measurement, was carefully assessed using sensitive methods. This technique would provide the opportunity to identify novel CSF biomarkers using mouse models.",

Conclusion: There were notable differences between this sample of people with YOD and LOD populations, regarding their diagnosis, comorbidities, diagnosing physician, etc, which has implications for multidisciplinary team input and post-diagnostic support. People with YOD most commonly die from complications of dementia, as opposed to people with LOD who often die with dementia. Advanced care planning appears to be suboptimal in people with YOD. More research is essential to inform future policies and services for this often neglected population. Many elderly patients with COPD have psychological problems such as anxiety and depression as an effect of the disease and represent the two least-treated comorbidities in the chapter of this pathology. The aim of the present study is to verify a possible correlation between COPD and depression in elderly outpatients. Materials: To all patients suffering from COPD who came for specialized assessment with spirometry examination at the Pneumology Clinic of Cuggiono Hospital of ASST WEST Milanese in the period October 2016 -December 2017 self-administered the Geriatric Depression Scale-J.

The indices considered in this study were: FEV1-FEV1/fvc and GDS. We therefore wanted to verify a possible correlation between the above mentioned indices. The results were as follows: correlating the indices among them of all the subjects studied we obtained: FEV1 versus GDS 0.05524, FEV1/ fvc versus GDS 0.019986. We then divided the subjects in relation to the severity of the GDS in three groups. A first group consisting of 100 subjects with GDS less than 10, a second group composed of 39 subjects with GDS between 11-15 and a third group composed of 21 subjects with GDS greater than 15. By evaluating the possible correlations we obtained the following data: Introduction: The inability to express pain in unconscious, chronically ventilated geriatric patients is a significant barrier to assess pain intensity.

Methods: Cross sectional study of outpatient laboratory data of 2015 from a German countrywide working laboratory company; inclusion criteria were age C 60 years, normal CRP, transferrin saturation, reticulocytes, LDH, haptoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor; exclusion criteria: GFR \\ 60 ml/min, lack of inclusion criteria; primary objective was the assessment of the mean leucocyte count, secondary objectives were the assessments of the mean counts of lymphocytes, eosinophil, neutrophil and basophil leucocytes as well as platelets in hematologic healthy persons aged C 60 years. Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of bacterial pneumonia that occurs on chronic and immunocompromised patients. There are inflammation and lung necrosis with formation of small cavitations. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphilococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the most frequent etiological agents. Desfavorable course to antibiotic therapy and CT-scan images make the diagnosis. However, pulmonary tuberculosis must be excluded. The elder patient has an atypical presentation. A 92-years-old institutionalized and dependent woman presented with fever, dyspnea, dry cough and anorexia at 3 days. She had dementia, cachexia, ischemic cardiopathy, and past-history of aspiration pneumonia 1-year before, and genital tuberculous 40-years before. She was diagnosed with rightbase pneumonia and started empiric antibiotherapy. Microbial studies were negative as well as interferon-c release assay. Due to persistence of symptoms the antibiotherapy was escalated without improvement. After naproxen fever resolved and sustained with linezolid/metronidazol. 25-days after she underwent thoracic computed tomography that was suggestive of necrotizing pneumonia. Bronchoscopy didn't aid morphologic information but the direct examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid shows mycobacterium tuberculosis. Done the diagnostic of pulmonary tuberculous (PT) she died 1 week after tuberculostatics onset. The incidence of tuberculosis in nursing home residents is three to four times higher than that of those living in the community. Comorbidities, immunosenescence, malnutrition, immunosuppressive therapy and unfavourable socioeconomic conditions, all contribute to the higher incidence of tuberculosis in the elderly patient. Advanced age is associated with PT atypical clinical presentations leading to delayed diagnosis and an increased rate of postmortem diagnosis. Results: Patients with PKM achieved only a minor functional improvement after geriatric intervention (stagnant Barthel Index at discharge \\ 35: 59% vs. 36%). Patients with PKM were more likely to receive a first time or higher degree of care certificate (68% vs. 50%). The main complications in the PKM group were Delirium (64%) and Dysphagia (50%). Pre-existing cognitive impairment was equally common in both groups. Discussion and conclusions: Delirium is known to be associated with an increased need of long-term care. Our data indicated this correlation also for dysphagia. Delirium and Dysphagia are associated with malnutrition and often cause a prolonged hospitalisation. Thus, it appears necessary to extend the geriatric basic assessment for patients with comprehensive need of care, in order to allow targeted indications for specific interventions, eg drug or nutritional therapy, in order to reduce the incidence of complications and inpatient readmissions, which would show positive effects on treatment costs and quality of life.",

The goal of this study was to assess the association between patient, health and functional characteristics and 12 month mortality after discharge. Knowledge of these predictors of mortality can support medical decision making. Methods: Retrospective study conducted between December 2014 and September 2015 acute geriatric wards of a Dutch teaching hospital. Included were patients admitted for at least one overnight stay. Demographic characteristics and health-related patient factors, including frailty and disability were collected. Results: 290 patients with a mean age of 84 years were included. The majority were women (60%). Mortality 12 months after discharge was 40.3%. Prevalence of disability, impaired mobility and cognitive decline were 81, 84 and 67% respectively. Significant predictors of mortality after 12 months were occurrence of delirium (Odds ratio (OD) 2.4), Charlson Comorbidity Index C 3 (OR 2.1) and low BMI (OR 0.9) in the multivariate analyses. The occurrence of all these predictors simultaneously raised the risk of mortality 17 fold. Frailty characteristics were not associated with higher mortality. Conclusion: in predominantly frail elderly patients 1 year mortality is associated with incident delirium, low body weight and concurrent comorbidity and not so much frailty features.

Results: The 230 seniors, distributed across 23 home health care teams, were divided almost equally by gender (54% women) and had a mean age of 84.

Introduction: A gap exists between evidence-based recommendations for post-fracture care and actual clinical practice. Our purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of an outpatient ortho-geriatric service in the prevention of re-fractures. Materials and methods: 271 hip fracture older patients were assessed within 40 days from hip fracture surgery. Patients underwent clinical assessment and standardized questionnaires by a multidisciplinary team. They receive pharmacological and non-pharmacological indications for falls and fracture prevention. All participants receive follow-up evaluation at 6 and 12 months for adverse events, including falls and re-fractures. Results: 79% women and 21% male with a mean age of 84 years, which preserved a good level of functional autonomy before the fracture, despite previous falls and fractures. More than half presents substantially preserved cognitive functions and received FKT program privately. Furthermore, patients receive a recommendation to change drug therapy, to promote the prevention and the appropriate management of ulcers from pressure. The anti-fracture treatment has been initiated in the 97% of cases with supplements of vitamin D and diet integration of calcium, while in the 66% of cases with most suitable drugs.",

Perceived loneliness was significantly correlated to loneliness measured by the UCLA score (r = 0.41, p \\ 1e-8).Statistically-significant predictive factors of inpatient loneliness were: loneliness pre-admission (r = 0.72, r = 0.48), depression (r = 0.52, r = 0.43) and anxiety (r = 0.48, 0.37).Those with better self-reported general health were less likely to feel lonely during inpatient admission (r = -0.25, r = -0.18).Interestingly, a patient's social network did not predict loneliness.Perceived loneliness, living alone, and anxiety, were correlated with willingness to accept intervention. Conclusion: The predictive factors for loneliness in older inpatients are easily ascertained by both self-reporting questionnaires and the UCLA score. The inpatient setting could be an opportunity to recognise those who are feeling lonely both in and out of hospital, and offer intervention.",

Discussion: There is a remarkable heterogeneity how geriatric issues are addressed in current clinical guidelines. Only few guidelines mention geriatric issues properly with a remarkable lack in the case of polypharmacia. On the other hand in most guidelines at least some geriatric aspects are mentioned. To improve this further a comprehensive effort is recommended in the guideline consenting process to address geriatric issues and provide special comments to clinical situations where those may influence recommendations.",

However, little is known about how to plan a randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving this group of patients. Having an evidence based approach could guide researchers designing RCTs and prevent underpowered trials. Method: We used baseline data from the GerMoT trial, a RCT comparing proactive outpatient care based on Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) with usual care. Multimorbid elderly patients with high healthcare utilisation were recruited to the trial. We define the number of patients that need to be identified and the number of eligible patients that need to be invited in order to achieve the desired recruitment number. Results: Of 1122 patients identified in a database as meeting inclusion criteria only 770 could be invited to participate in the trial. The rest had to be excluded or could not be reached for a variety of reasons despite considerable efforts made by our team of researchers. 420 of the invited patients agreed to participate with younger patients being more inclined to consent. Key conclusions: When planning a RCT involving this cohort of patients one can anticipate that less than 70% of patients identified as meeting inclusion criteria can be invited. We have also established that of those that can be invited the consent rate for such a trial is 54% and it varies slightly with age. We believe this information is generalizable beyond RCTs and can be used to plan recruitment to new proactive healthcare interventions involving this vulnerable group of patients.",

This project set out to evaluate the management of fracture risk in memory clinic attendees. Methods: Memory clinic attendees from the 1st of February until the 12th of March 2018 had their fracture risk calculated by FRAX \u00d2 as part of their routine appointment.

Belgium is the European country that consumes the most psychotropic drugs, mainly benzodiazepines The side effects of these drugs are well known, including cognitive disorders and balance disorders favoring falls, with the cascade of multiple consequences, complications often resulting in prolonged hospitalization, loss of autonomy and institutionalization. Withdrawal these medication requires first the collaboration of the patient, his entourage and all the professionals of the first line: attending physician, nursing home staff, etc. This is what the RGH Mons Hainaut geriatrics team proposes: in the context of day hospitalization, one of the planned actions concerns cognitive revalidation and resocialization, which includes support for medicated withdrawal. In practice, after consultation with the patient, the family and the attending physician and the home help services, a care plan is drawn up by the multidisciplinary team. Than a program is set up, providing a day hospitalization and then, two to three times per week the patient is welcomed into the institution. During these days, workshops and group activities are organized (speech spaces, workshops led by occupational therapists, speech therapists and physiotherapists) and individual interviews with the psychologist and dietitian. The average duration of weaning is of the order of 3 months with 2-3 sessions per week with about 40 sessions. After a period of 6 months, the first results can be presented: improvement of the multidisciplinary evaluation (cognition, risk of falling, activities of the daily life and instrumental activities, etc.)",

Goal. To assess the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AGT) on functional status markers in patients with frailty. Materials and methods: We examined 200 patients with frailty, aged 60 to 91, both sexes suffering from arterial hypertension (AH) who underwent AGT for 6 months (month) with an assessment of the functional status markers on the 180th day of the study. The evaluation of the effectiveness, safety of the AGT, as well as its impact on the functional status markers was carried out. Results: Based on the results of the study, the clinical efficacy and safety of AGT has been assessed. In patients with achieved target levels of arterial pressure (BP) 140/80-90 mmHg. improvement in the functional status markers was observed. Against the backdrop of AHT cases of falls and orthostatic hypotension was not recorded. In assessing the baseline daily activity index (Barthel Index), an easy 98.6 \u00b1 3.9 score was observed initially and a significant increase in baseline activity on the 180th day was 99.1 \u00b1 2.86 points. The decrease in instrumental activity assessed by the IADL scale was stable throughout the study and was 26.3 \u00b1 2.1 and 26.4 \u00b1 2.13 on the initial and on the 180th day, respectively. An improvement in walking markers, as measured by the ''Stand Up and Go'' test, was noted. Conclusion: The results of the study proved clinical efficacy and safety of AGT, its beneficial effect on functional status markers.",

It is often serious and may be responsible for more than 10% of hospitalizations in this population. Our objectives were to describe iatrogenic disease features in elderly and to determine risk factors for iatrogenic disease in these patients. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive and analytical study including patients aged of 65 years or older, who developed at least an iatrogenic drug effect. We compared demographic, clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic characteristics and outcome of elderly and non-elderly subjects. Results: Fifty-eight elderly subjects presented an iatrogenic event. The sex-ratio (M/W) was 1.07. Mean age of our patients was 72.2 \u00b1 7.3 years. Polypathology was present in 58.6% of patients and was statistically more common among older people. Arterial hypertension was the most common medical history in our patients (51.7%), followed by thromboembolic disease (41.4%). Arterial hypertension, stroke, rhythm disturbances and moderate renal failure were significantly more frequent in elderly. Cardiovascular drugs were significantly more prescribed in elderly, particularly anti-vitamin K (AVK). AVK overdose was the most noted iatrogenic drug effect in our series (29.3%), followed by hematological impairment found in 17.2%. AVK Overdose, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis were significantly more common in elderly. Incriminated drug was discontinued in 39 patients (67.2%) and doses was decreased in ? patients.

This paper quantifies the prevalence of comorbidities in an older community-dwelling population. . Multivariate ordered logistic regression was used to predict the severity of GIC classification with sex, age group, linguistic region and education level as predictors. Results: Increasing age (ORage 65-69 = 1.0; ORage 70-74 = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6; ORage 90 = 2.1, 95% CI 1.6-2.7) and being a women (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) is associated with a higher GIC class. German speaking and participants with more years of education were less likely to belong to a higher GIC class. Conclusions: Comorbidity is associated with increased adverse outcomes. Its study is essential for a comprehensive appraisal of health in the aged population. Objectives: To evaluate chronic lung disease comorbidity in nonagenarians and centenarians admitted to hospital and to analyse morbidity profiles of COPD patients. Methods: Prospective nested case-control study. All the centenarian admissions to our hospital from 2006 to 2016 were recorded and, for each one, 3 nonagenarian controls were included. Chronic lung disease history was retrospectively reviewed in detail. Lifetime diagnoses of COPD where classified in morbidity profiles: ''survivors'' (diagnosed \\ 80 years), delayers (80-100 years and scapers ([ 100 years or diagnosed at admission). Results: We recruited 602 admissions, 74.75% female. The APACHE was 10.85 \u00b1 4.14, Charlson Index 1.6 \u00b1 1.35. Main reasons for admission: respiratory infections in 22.9%, decompensated heart failure 14.5%, urinary infection 5.1%, stroke 3.3%, and hip fracture 2.6%. In 73 patients (12.1%) chronic lung disease was recorded: 44 COPD (60.3%), 13 asthma (17.8%), 2 tuberculosis sequels (2.7%), 2 repeated pulmonary aspiration (2.7%), 2 bronchiectasis (2.7%), 1 pulmonary fibrosis (1,4%) and 1 obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (1.4%). COPD patients were 94 \u00b1 3.24 years and 65% males. The APACHE was 11.4 \u00b1 4.2, Charlson Index 2.4 \u00b1 1.2. According to the COPD diagnosis, 28 were delayers (63.6%) and 16 survivors (36.4%).

Approximately a third of residents have Diabetes Mellitus. Complications such as hypoglycemia can infrequently occur amongst them. Sub-standard management may lead to increased glucose variability which in turn increases the risk of mortality. An audit revealed only 12% of the staff followed hypoglycemia management as per a standard protocol. Aim was to increase the percentage of staff at the long-term care facility using a standard protocol from 12% to 100% over 12 months. Methods: This is a Quality Improvement project which was carried out between January 2017 and March 2018. A multidisciplinary team was formed who used ''Dartmouth Microsystem Quality Improvement Model''. Baseline Process map with cause and effect diagram identified likely reasons for not using the standard protocol. Various interventions were carried out including simplifying a previously established protocol (First Intervention), educational training events (Second Intervention) for all the primary front-liners was provided, posters at the nursing stations and presentations at the television units at the nursing stations. Establishing Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on Hypoglycemia in Long-term Care Facility (Third Intervention). Results: A run-chart was used to monitor the response following aforementioned interventions. First Intervention showed significant improvement in the use of protocol to 60% within 2 months and subsequently increased to 100%. After establishing the CPG it remained at 100%. Conclusion: Dedicated multidisciplinary team utilizing a standard model of Quality Improvement produced significant change in the care provided during hypoglycemia management in a Long-term Care Facility in Qatar. Objective: To identify the disease characteristics of diabetes that are related to geriatric syndromes (GS) in older adults. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in 198 individuals with diabetes, using clinical interviews and common GS's screening scales. Syndromes investigated were the presence of falls in the last year by questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Geriatric Depression Scale, disability by the Global Disability Scale, physical function by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test and cognitive function by the Mini Mental State Examination. Results: Several geriatric syndromes like diminished physical function (TUG) (p = 0.038), falls (p = 0.021), disability (p = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.028) were related to diabetes macrovascular complications (presence of coronary, and/or carotid and/or lower limb artery disease), even though people with and without complications did not differ in terms of age or sex. Diabetes duration only showed a tendency for more prevalent disability (p = 0.076) and worst TUG performance (p = 0.095). Type of diabetes treatment, incidence of hypoglycemia and HbA1c were not correlated to any of the GS investigated. By contrast, disability (both p \\ 0.001), TUG (both p \\ 0.05), cognitive function (both p \\ 0.05) and depression (both p \\ 0.001) were related to self-rated health status and quality of life respectively. Key conclusions: The prevalence of GS in older adults with diabetes is mostly related to macrovascular complications, irrespectively of age or sex, and correlates to health status and quality of life subjective perception.",

A project in the field of Geriatrics was created and implemented in an internal medicine department in order to prove the benefits of a differential geriatrics approach. Objectives: Compare the data and outcomes of the patients included in the project with the remaining patients admitted in the same ward. Methods: Comparing age, gender, admission provenience, mortality, discharge destination, length of stay and mean number of diagnosis per patient during 1 year (April 2017 to April 2018) between the 2 groups. Results: During that period, there were 92 patients included in the project versus (vs) 5269 not included; characteristics of both groups were similar, with exception of mortality, which was lower in the project group (4.35% vs 13% in the rest of the population), medium age (83.5 years vs 73.65 years) and number of total diagnosis (13.79 vs 11.41). Average length of stay was slightly higher in the project. The patients on the project group were also more frequently sent to a hospital consultation for reevaluation. Discussion: Geriatric patients are very complex (older and with more comorbidities) and need a particular approach when admitted on a hospital ward in order to reduce morbidity, mortality and length of stay. With a geriatric approach, we were able to reduce mortality in an older population with more comorbidities, with only a slight increase in stay length.",

Its diagnosis is usually easy but the prognosis is quickly fatal. We report a case of sarcomatous degeneration of a PDB. Observation: Mr. KA, a 69-year-old high-smoking men (40 PA), with a history of dyslipidemia and ischemic coronary artery disease, had consulted for hip and left thigh inflammatory pain (EVA 8/10) since two months with impaired general condition not improved by symptomatic treatment. The physical examination showed a painful mobilization of the left hip with flexion limitation at 75\u00b0. The biology had shown a biological inflammatory syndrome (ESR = 80 in H1), a normal phospho-calcium balance except increased alkaline phosphatase at 284 IU / L. Pelvic X-ray radiography showed hypertrophy, cortical thickening and heterogeneous lytic lesion of the left iliac wing. A pelvic CT scan showed significant reshaping of the left iliac wing with multiple osteolytic areas and erasure of the cortex. A bone scintigraphy showed heterogeneous hyperfixation of the left hemipelvis with a discrete hyperfixation of the left scapula. A pelvic MRI showed bone lysis of the left iliac bone with bilobed tissue mass at the expense of ipsilateral psoas and gluteal muscles enhancing after Gadolinium injection. A bone biopsy was performed showing a pagetoid appearance with undifferentiated sarcoma of the bone. Thoracic CT was performed as part of an extension assessment showing pulmonary metastasis. The patient had been infused with zoledronic acid (Aclasta 5 mg) and was referred for chemotherapy. Conclusion: Although PDB appears nowadays less active and less severe, sarcomatous degeneration may be inaugural. It would be useful to start a multicentre study comparing the different treatments for sarcomatous degeneration in order to increase the median survival of patients.",

Ear, nose and throat (ENT) involvement is frequent but not often reported. Objectives of our work are to determine the prevalence of ENT involvement during RA over 65 years old and to evaluate its correlation with RA disease activity. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 21 consecutive RA over 65 years old, followed at the Rheumatology department of Monastir Teaching Hospital in Tunisia, during 06 months (November 2016 to April 2017) and 46 matched volunteers. ENT clinical examination with tonal audiometry and thyroid tests (TSH, T4, anti-Thyroperoxidase Ab (Anti TPO Ab) and Anti-Thyroglobulin Ab(Ab anti Tg) were performed. Results: ENT involvement prevalence was 62%. The most frequent functional signs were intermittent dysphonia in 52% and dysphagia in 47% of cases. The neck examination revealed painful larynx mobilization in 47% cases and cervical lymph nodes in 5% of cases. Indirect laryngoscopy, performed in the 57% of symptomatic patients, noted inflammatory mucosa in 33% of cases anddecrease in vocal cord mobility in 19% of cases. Fifty two percent of patients had temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) involvement. Tonal audiometry revealed 52% of cases of deafness: 33% sensorineural deafness, 23% conductive deafness and 2% cases mixed hearing loss. The ENT manifestations significantly associated to RA compared to the witness group (p \\ 0.01) were intermittent dysphonia, dysphagia, painful larynx mobilization, inflammatory nasal mucosa, painful TMJ and deafness. Active disease (DAS 28 [ 3.2) is statistically associated with deafness (p B 0.048) and TMJ involvement (p B 0.009). The ENT manifestations significantly associated to RA over 65 years old against RA under 65 years old were compared to the witness group (p \\ 0.01) were intermittent dysphonia, painful TMJ and deafness. Logistic regression study shows that RA duration over 10 years was associated to laryngeal dyspnea (OR = 4.4, p B 0.012, IC (95%) [1.377, 14.134] ) and deafness (OR = 3.8, p B 0.03, IC (95%) [1.142, 12.882] ). In the other hand, age over 65 years old is associated with ENT involvement (OR = 0.123, p B 0.016, IC (95%) [0.076, 0.772]) and deafness (OR = 7.8, p B 0.017, IC(95%) [1.431,43.175] ). Conclusions: ENT involvement is a very common, usually asymptomatic extraarticular manifestation during RA. It is, mainly, TMJ involvement, deafness and dysphonia. The main relevant determinants are age over 65 years old, RA disease activity and duration.",

It increases the risk of myocardial infarction two-to threefold in older women. Often is under-diagnosed since its clinical picture is silent and atypical. Aim of the study was to identify the effects of this disorder on cardiovascular conditions in older people as compared to adults. Materials and methods: A retrospective study performed on 120 randomly selected patients previously diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism, divided into 2 equal groups: adults (50-64 years), elderly (C 75 years), with equal number of women and men. Results: Prevalence of patients from rural area was 19.17%. Obesity was more prevalent in adults (54%). Hashimoto thyroiditis in past medical history was almost four times more prevalent in women in the general sample, and mostly in adults. Arrhythmias were more prevalent in older men (23%), but atrial fibrillation was significantly more prevalent in older women (p \\ 0.01). Atherosclerosis had a high prevalence in both age-groups ([ 70%), but significantly more prevalent in older group (p \\ 0.01) suggesting the long-term effects of subclinical hypothyroidism. Ischemic heart disease was significantly more prevalent in older men (p \\ 0.01), nearly twice as adult men. Stroke was twice as prevalent in older age group as compared to adults, and significantly more prevalent in men (0.001). Heart failure was significantly more prevalent in older women as compared to men of the same age group (p \\ 0.05) and to adult group (p \\ 0.001). Conclusions: Subclinical hypothyroidism increases the prevalence of cardio-cerebro-vascular conditions in older people most probably by being an additional risk factor. Introduction: Despite a preventive policy, the incidence of the \u00ab FNF\u00bb still reaches 8/1000 after 80 years old with a hospital mortality of 2 to 14% and a mortality at 1 year of 20 to 30%. The opening of the ortho-geriatrics' concept allowed to improve the life and functional prognosis of the elderly patients. The goal of our study was to define the predictive factors of the mortality at 30 days, 6 months and the overall mortality after an operated \u00abFNF\u00bb. Methods: In 2016, the physicians of the \u00abMOBILE GERIATRIC TEAM\u00bb (EMG) from the University Hospital of Nice opened an ortho-geriatrics department (daily visit at the trauma services). Accompanied by a social worker, they interviewed and examined the elderly patients over 75 years old who usually living at home and receiving surgical treatment for an \u00abFNF\u00bb. An unicentric prospective cohort was created as well as a collection of pre-, per-, and postoperative data. A phone calling to the caregivers and/or the general practitioner in charge allowed to complete the collected data and each was call back beyond the 6 months of post-operation in order to collect the judgment criteria. Results: During one year, 252 patients (median: 88,1 years old, 76,2% of women) were included. Being a man or having a chronic respiratory disorder were predictive factors for the mortality postoperation after 30 days (respectively OR 2.9 (1.05-8.12) and OR 3.8 (1.32-10.5) ). Regarding the mortality at 6 months, the postoperative confusion syndrome was a predictive factor of the mortality (OR 4.6 (1.75-12.87)), as well as the atrial fibrillation or the cancer as comorbidities (respectively OR 3.75 (1.25-11.34 ) and OR 1.4 (1.36-10.21) ). Regarding the overall mortality, the predictive factors were the postoperative confusion syndrome (OR 3.5 (1.62-8.07)), the age, the cancer or the chronic respiratory disorder as comorbidities (respectively OR 1.1 (1.03-1.17), OR 3.9 (1.65-9.52) and OR 2.7 (1.01-7.20) ). Conclusion: Despite that the FNF is an independent risk factor for death for elderly patients, this study has highlighted the predictive factors of death which are changeable or unchangeable. Having identified these risk factors, the geriatricians have to pay special attention to these elderly patients with death risk. be undervalued and as such diagnostic exams and antiosteoporosis drugs are not used. Objective: Compare hospitalized elderly patients with and without previous osteoporosis-related fracture. Methods: Retrospective study comparing elderly patients admitted during 2017 to an Internal Medicine Ward of a Tertiary Hospital with (wOF) and without (nOF) osteoporotic related fracture. Patients were characterized by age, gender, Katz score, FRAX evaluation, MUST score, modified Charlson score, average number of medication used, and use of antiosteoporotic treatment. Outcomes evaluated were average length of stay and mortality. Results: The study included 50 wOF patients and 253 nOF patients. Comparing the two groups the patients wOF had an average age of 83.2 vs 80.9 years; female gender 29(58%) vs 132(52%) patients; Katz \\ 3 of 6(12%) vs 116 (45%) patients; nutritional risk according to MUST 18 (36%) vs 69 (27.3%); average FRAX score of 13.7 vs 7,68; average Charlson score 3.72 vs 3.27; average number of medications used 7,51 VS 6,77; of which calcium, D vitamin and, bisphosphonates only in 6 vs 13 patients; and concerning realization of DEXA 14 vs 29 patients. Fractures were mostly hip 18, lumbar spine 10 and Colles fracture 6. Concerning the outcomes average length of stay 14.72 vs 10.1 days and mortality 20% VS 12.6%. Discussion: Despite of a high FRAX score, in these elderly hospitalized population, only a small number had done a DEXA exam and an even smaller number was taking antiosteoporosis drugs. In the sample, of the patients had a previous osteoporosis-related fracture they had a tendency for older age, female gender, higher nutritional risk, Charlson score and a higher average number of medications. They were less dependent, but had a higher average length of stay and mortality.",

A pilot study Introduction: Over 90% of stage III and IV pressure ulcers take longer than 2 months to heal. As reduced tissue vascularity is one of the mechanisms preventing skin ulcer healing, treatments able to improve local circulation could accelerate their clinical resolution. Given that Kinesio taping (KT), which is used in various painful musculoskeletal conditions, can improve local blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, this study aims to determine whether the application of KT near serious pressure sores can improve their healing. Methods: Ten unselected elderly poly-pathological patients (4 men, 6 women) with non-infected fourth-stage sacral bed sores were treated at home by our home-care service team. KT was applied close to a portion of the ulcer, while the contralateral portion was treated according to the standard protocol ('control', C). The surface reduction of both portions was measured every 4 days after KT application (5 follow-up visits: V1-V5). Results: On each visit, the mean percentage reduction was significantly greater in the KT-treated areas (KT-A) than in C: V1 = 21.9% vs 8.3%, p \\ 0.001; V2 = 38.3% vs. 17%, p \\ 0.001; V3 = 58.1% vs 25.8%, p \\ 0.001; V4 = 70.3% vs 36.9%, p \\ 0.001; V5 = 81.1% vs 46.3%, p \\ 0.001, respectively (paired-sample t-test). Furthermore, starting from V2, the number of ulcers that halved their extension was significantly higher in KT-A, with the maximum difference on V4 (8 ulcers halved in KT-A vs 2 in C, p = 0.007; Chi squared test). Key conclusions: KT can be an effective, rapid and low-cost therapy in fourth-stage pressure ulcers in elderly patients. Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, UK The gold standard for the management of all older people accessing the urgent care should be routine assessment for frailty syndromes and the presence of one or more should trigger a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Acute care of the elderly unit (ACE) was set up with the aim to provide to frail older patients the best quality of care involving a daily, holistic and interdisciplinary assessment to coordinate safe, clinical efficient and cost-effective early discharges. All patients admitted under acute care of the elderly were included. The LOS was collected from IT Data, CWS (Clinical Work Station) and the readmissions were collected from GRAPE and CWS during the period between January 2016 and December 2016. A total of 622 elderly patients were admitted to ACE in 2016 of which 437 patients were discharged as ACE. The average length of stay (LOS) in ACE during the period analysed was 3.7 days, compared with the national average of 9 days for patients over 65 years. Patient readmission rate was 7.9% within 30 days, compared with the national average of 15.5% (age over 75) indicating that a more rapid decision making does not pose a higher readmission risk if patients are assessed by a multidisciplinary team through a comprehensive evaluation. The pressure for hospital beds in the elderly continues to grow. A rapid population ageing needs changes in our current models of care assessing frail older people admitted with urgent care needs. It is proven that a comprehensive geriatric assessment of older people leads to better outcomes and units focuses on those patients likely to be able to return home within the first 24-72 h to admission are proving being efficient and effective.",

Ones who need home care are mostly the patients aged over 65. This care is generally run by the relatives of the patients. Often one person is in charge of caring the patient and that one may be in difficulty most of the time. This research aim is to determine the difficulty experienced by the one who provides home care for the patients aged over 65 by using ''Zarit Burden Interview''. Material-method: In this descriptive research, the ones who provide home care for the patients traced by Marmara University during the period of February-March 2016 were included. After taking approval of participants, Zarit Burden Interview of 22 questions, put into practice by asking the questions face to face. The result from Zarit Burden Interview can be minimum 0, maximum 88. Higher result shows higher experienced difficulty. 24 is considered to be cut-off score. Information including socio-demographic characteristics of caring ones and patients were recorded. Results were analysed by using SPSS Statistics 23.0 program and Mann Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. For the research ethical committee approval was received from Marmara University. Results: Totally 119 care givers (100 females, 19 males) participated in this study. In the study Zarit Burden Interview score was found out to be 49. 5 \u00b1 14.73 (12-79) . One hundred and eight (%90) care giver's score was higher than 24. The associations between the burden of care giver were; the period of caring the patient, care giver's age, gender, education level, relationship to the patient and working condition. Between care giver's burden score and his or her relationship with the patient (p = 0.038), patient's education level (p = 0.008), and caring period of the patient (p = 0.008) were found statistically significant. Conclusion: Evaluation of care giver's burden and determining the problems might help to increase living qualities of both the care givers and the patients. This awareness might provide more beneficial caring for the patient. The elderly in the middle-East are growing rapidly.

According to the WHO Department of Aging 2000 report, most Middle Eastern countries will be entering the window of opportunity during this decade, and the window is expected to last until midcentury. It is during this lucrative period that the groundwork for future geriatric services should be firmly established and nurtured. Therefore, this cross sectional study aims to assess the health needs of the elderly in order to deliver solid data for providing future geriatric services that can improve the quality of life of the elderly in the region. Information was gathered from elderly attending many health care and elderly facilities in Dubai, UAE. People who lived in the UAE and were 65 years old or above were included whilst those who were only visiting the UAE were not included. Overall, the total elderly population in Dubai is estimated to be 32,000 people. With a margin of error of 5% and a confidence level of 90%, the recommended sample size turned out to be 269 people. The sample size included in the study consisted of 300 individuals. The interRAI organization's community health assessment instrument (interRAI CHA) was used as a tool for gathering information. After filling in all the questionnaires, the data was entered into the SPSS Statistics program for analysis. The results obtained delineated which diseases need our support and improved prevention or management.

Emotional factors play a decisive role in social participation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of depressive symptoms on social participation in Turkish older adults. Methods: Five hundred thirty seven older adults (279 females; 258 males; mean age: 72.33 \u00b1 6.56 years) included in the study. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using by Short Form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The participants were divided into four groups according to the GDS scores: Group 1 (n = 263); no symptoms, 0-4 points from GDS, Group 2 (n = 165); mild depressive, 5-8 points from GDS, Group 3 (n = 58); moderate depressive, 9-11 points from GDS, Group 4 (n = 51); severe depressive, 12-15 points from GDS. Social participation was evaluated with a total of five open-ended questions. Results: 54.1% of the participants reported that they participated in leisure activities. 53.4% of these participants reported that they performed housekeeping and gardening. 60% of older adults participated in social activities. 48.4% of the elderly participating in outdoor social activities stated that they participated with their children or relatives. As the level of depressive symptoms increased in the older adults, their leisure activities (p = 0.0001), housekeeping and gardening (p = 0.0001) has been found to decrease their indoor activity participation. Also, increased depressive symptoms affected outdoor social participation of the older adults negatively (p = 0.0001). Key conclusions: The findings indicate that indoor and outdoor social participation of the elderly negatively affected by increased depressive symptoms.",

We tried to assess the relationship between chronic pain presence, depression and functioning level. Methods: 145 subjects older than 60 years (nursing home residents, or patients of outpatient geriatric clinic) were included. Information of pain presence, functional and mental status was obtained using a questionnaire. Chronic pain was defined as lasting [ 3 months, severity of pain was assessed using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), functional ability using Activities of Daily Living tool (ADL) and mood/possible depression using Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Results: The mean age of patients equaled 76 \u00b1 9.68 years, 78% reported chronic pain. Patients with chronic pain more often presented low mood, lower satisfaction with life, with no differences according to ADL. Unlike in case of pain, suspected depression was connected with poor functional status, with the lowest mood among bed-bounded people. Answer for question: 'what is your biggest health problem?' surprisingly was not pain, even among people with high intensity of pain (49 patients with [ 4 points in NRS), but inability to move/walk. Conclusions: Chronic pain in the elderly population is common, but even for patients with severe pain the biggest health problem and cause of depression is not pain, but lack of independence. That shows the continuum pain -depression -disability requires more holistic approach to improve quality of life of elderly patients on a daily basis.",

            "text": "Relationship between mean platelet volume and depression Introduction: Depression with high rates of morbidity and a risk for mortality is a common mood disorder in the elderly; associated with a chronic low-grade inflammation, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is widely used as a measure of platelet size and it is known to be a marker of platelet activity. Clinical trials have proven that MPV could be used as a biomarkers of inflammation in various diseases. The aim of this study is to show a correlation between depression status and MPV in elderly population. Methods: 266 patients aged 65 years or above, followed in outpatient geriatric clinic in Ege University Hospital from November 2015 to December 2017 are included in this observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study. The study included patients aged 65 years and nondiabetic, non-malignant, normal cardiac and renal function. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to short form geriatric depression scale; normal: 0-4, mild depression: 5-8, moderate depression: 9-11; severe depression: 12-15. The data was transferred to SPSS 17 (Statistical Package for Social Science) program. Values are given as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The Mann Whitney U test was used to compare values between groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to analyze multiple group values. Results: The study involved 266 patients (178 female, 88 male); mean age, platelet(PLT) and MPV of all patients were 78.2 \u00b1 7.5, 253,000 \u00b1 63,000 and 10.6 \u00b1 0.9, respectively. There was no significant difference between the mean age of patients, PLT number and MPV values according to sex (F: age 78.2 \u00b1 7.7, Plt 260,000 \u00b1 62,000, MPV 10.6 \u00b1 0.96, M: age 78.0 \u00b1 7.0, PLT 258,000 \u00b1 65,000, MPV 10.6 \u00b1 1.0). According to geriatric depression score, 62% (n: 166) of the patients were normal, 22% (n: 59) mild, 8.6% (n: 23), middle and 7.5% Statistically significant differences were found between the MPV and PLT numbers among the patients with moderate to severe depression (10.2 \u00b1 1.1 / 11 \u00b1 1 P value: 0.041, 292,000 \u00b1 66,000 236,000 \u00b1 53,000, P value: 0.024). Conclusions: In this study we found a significant increase MPV in patients with severe depression in compared to patients with moderate depression. There was a significant decrease in PLT count in moderate and severe depression group. Further investigations from different centers are needed whether the deterioration in the MPV induces depression or if it changes due to neurohumoral changes in the depression. Results: The mean MMT scores were 12.1\u00b17.5 and GDS scores were 23.5\u00b15.4. As a result of CDC HRQOL-4 scores, the mean physically (PUD) and mental unhealthy days (MUD) were 10.35\u00b110.03 and 6.84\u00b19.04 days, respectively. Besides the mean of activity limited days (ALD) were 6.84\u00b19.04 days. While GDS, PUD, MUD and ALD scores were significantly greater in female gender geriatrics (p = 0.0001), the MMT scores was greater in male gender (p = 0.0001). Key conclusion: The results of the study indicated that cognitive, psychological status and health related quality of life is more affected in female geriatrics, negatively.",

These models require fewer resources, but their effectiveness is not clear. In the present study we compared the rate of implementation of geriatric recommendations by different assessment models. The patients in Model ''OCGAU'' were older (mean age 83.2 \u00b1 6.2 years) than in ''Clinic'' models (mean age was 79.7 \u00b1 6.5, 81.5 \u00b1 6.1, and 80.7 \u00b1 6.5, P\\0.001).

The purpose of the study was to identify factors that reduce the implementation rate of geriatric recommendations. Methods: The medical records of patients who were assessed in the OCGAU over an 8-year study period were surveyed. The data included patient's characteristics (socio-demographic, functional, cognitive, and affective condition, co-morbidity), number of recommendations, the identity of the geriatrician, and data related to the primary physician (age, sex, seniority, number of patients referred for geriatric assessment). Results: Three thousand four hundred thirty-four recommendations were made for 488 patients (mean age 83.6 \u00b1 0.6 years) of which 1634 (47.6%) were implemented by their primary physician. In univariate analyses patients with an implementation rate \\ 25%, compared to patients with implementation rate C 75%, had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index Total Score (CCITS) (2.5 \u00b1 1.9 vs. 1.8 \u00b1 1.7, P \\ 0.05), a lower Barthel Index (82.8 \u00b1 16.2 vs. 87.0 \u00b1 15.3, P \\ 0.05), and a lower Instrumental Activity of Daily Living score (7.2 \u00b1 3.5 vs. 8.2 \u00b1 3.7, P \\ 0.05).

Previously it has been difficult to examine the vestibular system and there has been no tradition of including this examination in fall assessment in the elderly. The video head impulse test (vHIT) is a new, easy and cheap way to examine the vestibular system and thereby possibly diagnose vestibulopathy. Cases: An 84-year-old woman, previously no medical history overall. Complained about slowly progressing unsteadiness of gait and dizziness. Worsening of symptoms in the dark or on uneven ground. No symptoms at rest. No episodes of falls or syncope. Multifactorial fall assessment identified risk factors in form of vision impairment and impairment of balance due to peripheral neuropathy. Supplementary vHIT showed bilateral vestibulopathy with pathological gain with subsequent saccades on both right and left side (Gain: 0.37 and 0.56 respectively). An 89-year-old woman, complained about unsteadiness and oscillopsia, emerging after abdominal surgery where she had received aminoglycosides. Multifactorial fall assessment identified risk factors in form of impairment of balance and muscle strength. Caloric test showed bilateral canal paresis with no nystagmus at all on both sides. Supplementary vHIT confirmed markedly bilateral vestibulopathy with pathological gain (Gain: 0.05 and 0.09). Conclusion: Gait unsteadiness and dizziness are often multifactorial in origin. Bilateral vestibulopathy may be an underestimated condition in elderly with gait unsteadiness and dizziness. vHIT may be suggested as a part of falls screening guidelines in elderly. Nevertheless further research on the subject is recommended.",

A multi-dimensional evaluation including neuro-geriatric skills can be valuable to select candidates undergoing these procedures. Methods: A 70-year-old woman with a non-clear functional impairment was observed at the Cognitive Disorders Center of Geriatrics (Florence) for preliminary evaluation of percutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis. Results: Presence of mild cognitive impairment, bradykinesia and postural instability determining a rapidly progressive functional impairment were reported since 2 years: preserved BADL (Basic Activities of Daily Living) 2/6. Multiple deficits emerged in a global cognitive assessment, especially in executive functions. Neurological examination showed ideomotor apraxia of left upper limb and left emineglect. A magnetic resonance showed right parieto-occipital hyperintensity. On suspicion of neurodegenerative disease as corticobasal degeneration, a Positron Emission Tomography was performed showing right hemisphere cortical hypometabolism and metabolic reduction in the right caudate and thalamus. Considering the modest cardiological symptomatology limited to the effort, reduced functional capacity and prognosis of the neurodegenerative disease, indication to TAVI was excluded. After 6 months the patient remained stable on cardiovascular level, while a further deterioration of the cognitive-motor pattern with progression of functional dependence (BADL 0/6) emerged. Key conclusions: Identifying the pathogenesis of the disorders in the present case allowed to formulate a prognosis and to modify the interventional approach to heart disease. Neurogeriatric evaluation can be useful for the Heart Team to schedule intervention strategies. Introduction: Gold standard guidance on management of Parkinson's disease (PD) by NICE was updated in 2017 [1] . This audit compared current outpatient management in the Geratology Department at John Radcliffe Hospital against this guidance. Methods: Ninety-two closed questions were designed to enable paper and electronic clinic notes to be audited against the NICE guidance. After exclusion of new referrals, seven cases were randomly selected from Geratology PD clinics. Results: Areas of good practice included communication with patients and carers (accessible point of contact and advice about driving given in 100% cases), clinical diagnosis based on UKPDS Brain Bank Criteria (100%) and offering levodopa early when quality of life was impacted (100%). However, our analysis suggested a need for better provision of oral and written information about side effects of dopaminergic therapy (impulse control disorder 33%; psychotic symptoms 17% cases). Other areas for improvement included offering a cholinesterase inhibitor in mild-moderate PD dementia (33%), early multidisciplinary team (MDT) involvement (physiotherapy 43%; occupational therapy 29%) and provision of information regarding palliative care (advance care planning 14%). Key conclusions: Recommendations were made in the departmental audit meeting across three key areas: documentation, pharmacological and MDT. We suggested using a specialist nurse proforma to both prompt and document the provision of key information to patients and carers. We also recommended offering a cholinesterase inhibitor in mild-moderate PD dementia and early assessment by PD-experienced MDT specialists. Limitations of our analysis include the small sample size and focus on Geratology clinics (Neurology PD clinics were not audited).

Medical complexity of resident included complex epilepsy with seizures occurring three times a week, brittle asthma, ischaemic heart disease, old strokes, type 2 diabetes mellitus on background of congenital tetraplegia and impaired immune system. The resident was able to use an electric wheelchair to mobilise and on occasions presented to staff with drowsiness and confusion. Prescribed 35 medications. Results: 11 medications were stopped. Phenytoin dose was optimised, Fentanyl dose reduced. Total cost savings on medicines stopped was \u00a32 677. On follow up at 4 and 12 weeks seizures reduced from 12 to 1 per month. Patient was alert and referred for physiotherapy on request. Conclusion: A holistic multidisciplinary review ensures patient treatment is optimised to achieve their preferred outcome with reduction in medication burden and risk of harm. Introduction: Measuring health status of elderly is essential for the prediction of their health care needs. Health research usually considers objective outcome measure; however there is a need to increase self-reported measures of health. The aim of our study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SF-36 among a group of Lebanese elderly. Methods: It was a cross-sectional observational study. A systematic sample of elderly people aged 60 years and more was selected from dispensary, private and governmental hospitals randomly selected in Beirut city. Data were collected using face-to-face interview. The first part of the questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic characteristics. The second part consisted of the Arabic version of the SF-36. The third part consisted of Activity of Daily Living (ADL) scale, number and type of health problems and number of medications consumed per day. Results: A total of 251 elderly people were included. The mean age was 70.69 \u00b1 7.70 years. Cronbach alphas for all SF-36 scales exceeded 0.798. The intra-Class correlation coefficient varied between 0.675 (item 2) and 0.980 (items 14, 16 and 18) indicating good reliability. SF-36 was able to discriminate participants according to their sociodemographic characteristics and health problems: The quality of life (QoL) of women was poorer than men (p value \\ 0.001). It was significantly lesser when the number of health problems (p value \\ 0.001) and medications (p value \\ 0.001) increased, and the ADL score (p value \\ 0.05) decreased. Conclusions: SF-36 is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring QoL among Lebanese elderly and could be used for monitoring the QoL of this population. Introduction: Up to 26% residents in Nursing Home (NH) have cancer, and their care represents a challenge. The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence of older adults with cancer in Europe to better understand its impact. Methods: Longitudinal multi-centre cohort study based on data from the Services and Health for Elderly in Long TERm care (SHELTER) study. Participants were assessed through the interRAI-LTCF tool including cancer assessment. Results: Among 3698 residents, 428 (10.7%) had cancer (mean age 86.4\u00b17.2; 62.8% women). France was the country having the highest number of reported cancer cases (17.6%) and Italy the fewest (6.6%). The most frequent kind of cancer were pancreas, breast, colon, skin and lung. The most common cancer patients were white women older than 85 years. Excessive polypharmacy (C 10 drugs) was higher in residents with cancer (30.1% vs. 23.6% P \\ 0.001). Cognitive impairment was more prevalent among cancer patients (47.4-38.7% P \\ 0.001). Threw up, falls, dyspnea and pain had a higher prevalence in residents with cancer (p \\ 0.05 for all). 20.8% cancer residents experienced daily pain in last 3 days, and the 5.8% experienced breakthrough pain despite large use of painkillers (p \\ 0.05). Conclusions: Cancer patients are prevalent in NH but supportive seems to be poorly provided, especially in terms of pain management. Introduction: The visual complaints of elderly patients are not always easily understood primarily; sometimes, on the first view, they might not harmonize with the doctor's findings. Methods: From the experience collated in a private practice for ophthalmology low vision caused by age related macular degeneration (AMD), visual field defects caused by glaucoma or stroke and hallucinations in Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) were chosen as important topics, the clock-test as an important tool for understanding elderly patients with visual handicaps: patients' complaints and clinical findings were analyzed and compared with each other. Results: The understanding of a patient's visual disability and perception is the first step. Second, in AMD magnifying low vision aids and reading strategies, in visual field defects, especially hemianopic field defects, reading strategies and training of explorative saccades into the hemianopic field can support the coping with everyday tasks, in CBS especially behaviorial strategies. The clock test was found to be a very important tool to differentiate visual impairment caused by diseases of the eye or optic pathways up to the primary visual cortex from neglect or visual impairment caused by beginning dementia. Key conclusions: Understanding of the variety of visual impairment in different diseases of elderly patients, basically, is very beneficial not only for ophthalmologists but also for geriatricians in everyday work, especially when performing the geriatric assessment.",

Methods: The higher aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of VHD in nursing home residents and examine associations with comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and the prognostic impact of both. The recruitment phase of a prospective study in two nursing homes in Cologne begun in April 2018. MD and PhD students underwent structured cardiac auscultation training and subsequent examination of nursing home residents willing and able to consent was planned which additionally included assessment of the performance of a structured CGA. Based upon the functional, psychosocial and clinical CGA domains, a Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) is calculated which allows the classification of patients according to low-(MPI-1, 0-0.33), middle-(MPI-2, 0.34-0.66) and high-(MPI-3, 0.67-1) risk of mortality. Using a stepwise approach, based on auscultatory suspicion of valve disease, patients will undergo confirmatory transthoracic echocardiography. MPI values will be compared from patients with confirmed versus those without valve disease and clinical decision making will be evaluated accordingly. Preliminary Observations and research outlook. Despite the careful ethical and logistic improvement process which led to a patient-friendly, uncomplicated study design, the response rate of both nursing homes and nursing home residents/caregivers was low. Strategies are currently implemented to improve the recruitment process in this study, which has a high potential of providing important information on the impact of VHD in nursing home residents.",

Although it represents a risk factor for metabolic and respiratory outcomes, its assessment and contribution to functional decline appears ignored. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of OD in a large population of community-dwelling older people and to evaluate its relationship with malnutrition and physical function. Methods: 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) and Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF) were used to identify the risk of dysphagia and malnutrition. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and handgrip strength were used as functional endpoints. The relationship between risk of dysphagia and functional outcomes was tested in a multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and sex (Model 1) and for other confounders including Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and polypharmacy (Model 2). Results: Mean age of 773 subjects (61.3% females) was 81.97 years. 30.1% of participants was at risk of dysphagia (EAT C 3), 37.8% was malnourished (MNA-SF \\ 8), 46.2% was at risk of malnutrition (8 \\ MNA-SF \\ 11).

Consequences for mobility rehabilitation and fall prevention Laura Schmidt 1 , Thea Laurentius 1 , L. Cornelius Bollheimer 1 , Joao P. Batista Jr 1 1 Department of Geriatric Medicine, RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany Introduction: Handgrip strength is used as an overall surrogate for decreased muscle strength and is one criterion for physical phenotype of frailty according to Fried. Frailty is well reported as a predictor of falls but handgrip strength as well as gait velocity deliver only limited and indirect information about the muscle strength of the lower limbs which is very important in renowned tests to detect fall and functional mobility, such as the chair-rise(CR) and the timed up&go test (TUG). Aim: To compare isometric knee extension strength in frail versus non-frail subjects with propensity to fall. Methods: Geriatric patients (C 70 years) will be included and divided into two sub-groups: Frail and non-frail subjects. To evaluate the propensity to fall the TUG and CR will be evaluated. Isometric knee extension strength will be investigated by a handheld dynamometer positioned at the front of the ankle with patient seated on bed with knee at 70\u00b0flexion (0\u00b0= max. extension). Participants will be instructed to push the dynamometer as strong as possible for three times. Frailty will be measured based on the physical phenotype criteria provided by Fried. Expected results and clinical relevance: We expect to find lower muscle strength of frail geriatric patients for upper and lower limbs as well as some relationships between Frailty scores and knee extension strength. Although handgrip is regarded to be accurate to measure muscle strength in frailty patients, little attention has been given to other muscle groups that would reflect closer dependency of the mobile capacity and fall prevention related tests.",

Falls and physical inactivity prevention are the cornerstones of building a good perception on safety and promoting health and well-being of older people with disability or frailty. Ability to adapt, empowerment and reliability must be increased by an integrated socio-sanitary team, privileged point of connection and support. Methods: A physiotherapy assessment tool (Svft_02) was used to assess physical and psychosocial skills and pain of elders who were patients and former patients of the physiotherapy Primary care unit in Genoa.

In this study, the influence of preoperative CGA and frailty on postoperative morbidity, mortality, and delirium was examined. Methods: 108 geriatric patients for whom elective operation planned were evaluated. CGA and Freid Criteria were performed to patients. We used the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity score(POSSUM), the American Society of Anesthesiologists Score(ASA), the British United Provident Association Score(BUPA) and the Charlson Comorbidity \u0130ndex (CCI) to determine the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Assessment Test for Delirium (4AT) were applied for detection of delirium. Patients were followed for postoperative delirium, morbidity and mortality. Results: The median age was 71 years, 25% of the patients were frail. The mortality and morbidity rate were 0.9% and 28.7% respectively. The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale(IADL) (p: 0.032), the Mini-Nutrition Assessment(MNA) (p: 0.01) and the Mini Mental State Examination(MMSE) score (p: 0.026) were found to be significantly lower in patients with morbidity. POSSUM physiology score (p: 0.005), operative score (p: 0.015) and CCI (p: 0.029) were significantly higher in the patients with morbidity. Patients who developed morbidity were found to be more frail (p \\0.001). Delirium developed in 3.7% of the patients. Patients who developed delirium were older (p: 0.039), all of them were frail, and 50% had dementia. The patients with delirium were found to have lower IADL score (p: 0,049) and MMSE score (p: 0,004) and higher POSSUM physiology score (p: 0.005). As a result of multivariate analysis, it was found that frailty, POSSUM operative score and preoperative systolic blood pressure were found to be independently related factors in developing postoperative morbidity. Conclusion: In our study, comprehensive geriatric assessment and frailty in the preoperative period indicated postoperative morbidity and delirium. Introduction: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends home hazard assessment and intervention in falls prevention in community dwelling older people. There are no specific recommendations in prevention of falls outside of home. We conducted a service evaluation project in a district hospital looking at falls presentation in older people attending the emergency department assessing the location of the fall and the immediate consequences. Methods: We collected data of people aged 70 and above who had fallen and presented to the emergency department (ED) in the year 2017. We randomly selected 200 patients using simple randomisation methods of 1 in every 10 patients and exempted patients from care homes. Results: The total number of visits to the ED of our district hospital was 105,116 for the year 2016-2017 across all age groups of which 21,243 were adults aged 70 years and above. A total of 2097 (9.9%) patients aged 70 and above presented with a history of fall to the ED in the year 2017. Of the 200 (9.5%) patients evaluated, the average age is 84 years, females 137 (68.5%) and males 63 (31.5%). 173 (87%) had fallen indoors at home, 20 (10%) outdoors and 7 (3%) not stated. 134 (67%) in total were admitted, out of which 120 (69%) had fallen indoors and 10 (50%) outdoors. 43 (21.5%) had significant injuries, consisting of 23 (16.5%) fracture neck of femur, 18 (9%) other fractures, and 5 (2.5%) traumatic brain injury. Of these 43 patients, 42 (98%) of them were admitted and 4 (2%) of them had fallen outdoors. 4 (2%) deaths were recorded. Conclusion: Majority of the older people attending emergency department had fallen at home. While home based interventions are important in prevention of falls in older people, fall prevention advice outside of home should also be considered. Eur Geriatr Med (2018) 9 (Suppl 1):S1-S367",

Baseline assessment included patient characteristics, tumor staging and geriatric assessment in social, physical functioning and cognition domains. Background: Sarcopenia, defined as the loss of muscle mass and function, is a geriatric syndrome potentially reversible and often leading to frailty. Multiple factors positively influence and are affected by sarcopenia, including cardiac function. However, no study has fully addressed the relationship between skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in older patients with sarcopenia and physical frailty. Methods: 100 sarcopenic and physical frail outpatients, 32 men (M), 68 women (F), (mean age 79.8\u00b15.1 M, 78.6 \u00b1 5.3 F; aLM 21.4 \u00b1 3.0 M, 15.3 \u00b1 2.1 F) with data available on appendicular lean mass (aLM) and left ventricular mass (LVM) were evaluated. 70% had hypertension. Each participant underwent cardiologic assessment and echocardiography to estimate LVM. Sarcopenia was evaluated with Dual X-ray absorptiometry basing on the values of aLM and was defined according to FNIH criteria. Physical frailty was defined on SPPB score between 3 and 9. Results: We found a positive and statistically significant correlation between aLM and LVM (r = 0.56; p \\ 0.001) but also with other structural left ventricular parameters such as end-diastolic (r = 0.53; p \\ 0.001) and end-systolic volumes (r = 0.47; p \\ 0.001), end-diastolic (r = 0.49; p \\ 0.001) and end-systolic diameters (r = 0.46; p \\ 0.001), septal (r = 0.35; p \\ 0.001) and posterior wall thicknesses (r = 0.34; p \\ 0.001) but not with functional left ventricular parameters. Conclusions: In older people low skeletal muscle mass is associated with low LVM. The mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear; however physical activity, insulin resistance, inflammation may mediate this association.",

Aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of a tool combining short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF) and gait speed. Methods: Consecutive patients C 75 years referred for TAVI in Poitiers hospital between March 2013 and September 2017 were included. Geriatric evaluation and 6-minutes walking test (6MWT) were performed before the procedure. Gait speed was based on 6MWT. CGA was established as the reference test and included information on functional, cognitive and nutritional status; comorbidity; and medication. Two cohorts were established to develop and validate the tools. Results: We included 280 patients (46% women, mean age 85.5 \u00b1 4.2 years), 139 in developmental cohort and 141 in validation cohort. CGA was impaired in 221 (79%) patients. The screening tool combining MNA-SF and gait speed (cutoff, 0.83 m/s) showed good sensitivity (83 and 88%, respectively) and specificity (71 and 77%, respectively) in both cohorts. Positive likelihood ratio (LR) and negative LR were respectively 3.0 and 0.2 in first cohort and 3.6 and 0.2 in second cohort. The area under the curve was 0.8 in both cohorts. Key conclusions: An easily performed screening tool that combines gait speed and MNA-SF could facilitate identification of elderly patients who should require evaluation by geriatrician before valvular therapy. Introduction: The G8 screening tool was developed to identify older cancer patients who could benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Our aim was to provide a systematic overview of the characteristics and results of primary studies using the G8 in cancer patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in 4 databases and 3 study registries. Based on inclusion criteria (primary study with cancer patients, use of G8), titles/abstracts and full-texts were screened and data was extracted by 2 reviewers independently. Conflicts were resolved through discussion or a third person. Results: Of 4683 identified references, 36 studies reported the use of G8 in cancer patients. Mean patients age ranged from 72-83 years. Studies varied with regard to cancer type (e.g. specific types, mixed samples) and treatment modality (e.g. chemotherapy, surgery). Impairments in G8 (B 14 of max. 17 points) were examined in 33 studies ranging from 26-91%. In 28 studies, the G8 was compared with other (frailty) instruments (e.g. Vulnerable Elders Survey) or CGAs. The latter differed with regard to included instruments (e.g. Mini-Nutritional Assessment) and cut-offs for defining impairment. Prognostic relevance (e.g. mortality, functional decline) of G8 was investigated in 15 studies with varying results depending on outcome and cancer type. Key conclusions: Since its development in 2012, G8 was used in numerous studies varying in purpose, patient groups, methods and results. More work in well-defined patient groups is needed to demonstrate the benefits of this tool. Conflict of interest: The project was financially enabled by Nestec S.A.",

Likewise, it is known that the risk of recurrent emergency hospital stays increases with increasing age. Older people have, to a greater extent, more hospital stays classified as avoidable than other patient groups. Good coordination and continuity is a prerequisite for these patients and their relatives to feel safe and involved. Research in the field shows that safe patients feel to a lesser extent that they are in urgent need. At the same time, statistics from 2015 show that 1 in 7 patients were unplanned admitted to hospital within 30 days, of which half occurred within 1 week. 30% had not had a care contact between discharge and readmission (2) . Statistics also showed that S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Hospital had a higher proportion of readmission than other emergency hospitals in SLL 2015. Within the geriatric sector, the proportion of readmissions fell within 30 days at 12.9%. In the fall of 2015, therefore, the geriatrics of STS, including three emergency care services with a total of 53 hospital beds, were decided to seek project funding to actively work to reduce the proportion of readmission through prevention work through the SVEA project, Combined Care through Uniform Work, initiated by Health and Safety health care administration within the Stockholm City Council.",

In the healthcare team, visualize ''the fragile patient'' and increase knowledge and communication about factors that cause avoidable readmission, but not caught by our established trials estimates. Method: Statistics from previous projects in the geriatrics show that it is neither meaningful nor workable to call all patients discharged from the geriatric care. Therefore, it was decided that all patients during their stay would be assessed according to a form developed at Brommageriatriken ''Risk assessment for readmission''. In the assessment form, the team answers yes or no whether the patient has the following; heart failure, COPD, pain, fall hazard or previous cases, more than two hospital stays in the past year, polypharmacy, anxiety and / or depression, cognitive impairment and risk medicines, such as Warfarin, NSAIDs, sedatives and / or neuroleptics. assessment is done by the entire care team to simultaneously visualize the fragile patient and increase knowledge about these. The patients who were considered to be fragile (C 4 points) were booked for a telephone call with a doctor within 3-5 days after printing. The idea of the conversation is that it will focus on completing the planning done at the time before discharge and that the patient can handle his health condition as planned at home. Results: The result shows that we have lowered the percentage of readmission from 12.9% to 10.1% between 2015 and 2016. This represents a decrease of about 22%. Statistics show that all patients booked for follow-up call are called up of wich about 85% are dialed within 5 days of discharge. Approximately 39% of all patients who treated at hospital ward are called up, which corresponds to approximately 3-4 calls per department and doctor per week. A very small percentage of patients who are not followed up with telephone calls are reinstated, indicating that we capture the most fragile elderly in our assessment form. However, statistics show that our patients with dementia are to a small extent followed up by telephone calls, as they rarely reach up to 4 points, but at the same time have a higher readmission rate than other patients. Unfortunately, despite good results, the knowledge and communication in the healthcare team has not increased around these patients. The assessment is usually done by the doctor himself, without any remaining members of the team and the knowledge exchange and communication has not improved. Conclusions: By simple assessment, we can catch the ''fragile elderly'' patient group and with a follow-up phone call after discharge prevent readmission. On the other hand, we can see that the demented patient is not caught in the estimation and is still reintroduced to a greater extent. The challenge is to find a way to capture this patient group as well, and reduce the readmission rate. The assessment of the patient in connection with the round in the ward did not become the team-friendly task the project group hoped for. Because the doctor is the one who calls the patient after discharge, it also became the one who usually performed the assessment alone. In order to visualize ''the fragile patients'' in the care team and to increase knowledge and communication, the team probably needs support and resources in the introduction of new working methods.Application and dissemination of results. The result of the project has resulted in the fact that we now have telephone follow-up after geriatric end-care as a routine for our three geriatric care departments.

We have learnt from many studies how to reduce risk of delirium and yet this acute confusional state is common among s older adults in hospital. This study designed a 21 day pathway to provide cognitive enablement at home to support rapid recovery from delirium in a familiar home setting. Patients with delirium were identified and treated by consultant physician and psychiatrist. An individual care plan was produced after discussion with patient and family. Patients were discharged onto a daily virtual ward round, with a 24-hour live in carer and reviewed at day 4 by Occupational Therapist (OT) and day 7 by OT and social worker. Day 10 patients attended ambulatory care for joint review of physical and mental health. Patients received a financial assessment on discharge from the DRP. Objective: Delirium is a frequent problem among older patients in the Emergency Department (ED) and early detection is important to prevent its associated adverse outcomes. Several screening tools for delirium have been proposed for the ED, such as the Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU).

Methods: Older patients with a postoperative delirium following hipsurgery from a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of haloperidol prophylaxis on delirium incidence were included in this study [1] . The ACB was quantified using two different tools, the Anticholinergic Drug Scale and an Expert Panel. Using linear regression, the association between the anticholinergic burden and delirium duration and severity was analyzed. Results: Overall delirium duration and severity were not significantly associated with the ACB. Also, no statistical significant differences were found in delirium duration or severity between the placebo and haloperidol treatment groups for the anticholinergic burden groups. The protective effect of haloperidol on delirium duration and severity however tended to be present in the patients with no or a low ACB but not or to a lesser extent in patients with an intermediate to high ACB. Conclusions: The ACB was not significantly associated with delirium duration or severity. The use of haloperidol however tended to shorten delirium duration and decrease delirium severity in patients with no or a low ACB. Additional research with a larger study population and ACB quantification taking drug exposure into account is warranted to further assess the influence of anticholinergic drugs on delirium duration and severity and the effect of concomitant haloperidol use. Background: Delirium is a common neurocognitive disorder in hospitalized older patients. It has been shown to correlate with increased length of hospital stay, mortality, and admission to nursing home (Inouye, Westendorp, & Saczynski, 2014; Siddiqi, House, & Holmes, 2006; Vida et al., 2006) . The purpose of this study was to develop an evidence-based practice guideline for delirium management in hospitalized older patients. Method: A multidisciplinary task group at a medical center in southern Taiwan was established. Team members reviewed current delirium practice guidelines. An adapted practice guideline was developed by constructing foreground questions of key issues, systematical search, appraisal and synthesizing evidences. After a new draft of guidelines was established, the Delphi method was used to reach consensus among expert. Finally, the developed guideline was applied in a geriatric ward of a medical center to evaluate its applicability.",

            "text": "Non-pharmacological, multicomponent delirium interventions: Team-based approaches for the acute geriatric setting Objective: Delirium is an often undiscovered and serious syndrome that often occurs in the geriatrics, and therefore requires delirium detection, prevention and management. Among these, non-pharmacological, multicomponent interventions have proven effective, which has been demonstrated primarily by selected, low-threshold and voluntarily provided prevention components. However, there are hardly any findings with regard to the service provision of the entire spectrum, which, as expected, requires the expertise and close cooperation of health care professionals. Therefore, the question of which team-based interventions are available was pursued. Methods: A scoping review was performed; research strategies were generated based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by a systematic database search. Title, abstract and full text screening (3.809/77) by two independent reviewers led to the inclusion of 24 studies. The narrative presentation of the results was adapted from the PRISMA statement; the critical appraisal was made by means of the CReDECI 2 checklist and specific teamwork criteria. Results: 45.83% of intervention programs address detection/prevention; one management, while 50% address the entire spectrum. The number of identified intervention components varies from three to 18, of which mobilisation and training (83.33%) are most represented. Duration, frequency and type of interventions are described in different qualities; processes, procedures and areas of responsibility are hardly comprehensibly depicted. Patient outcomes (e.g. prevalence/ incidence) are usually reported in the studies, in contrast to teamassociated endpoints (e.g. adherence, education). Conclusion: To date, few delirium intervention programs available cover the spectrum of detection/prevention/management for acute geriatric clients and adequately describe team-based approaches. Background: Delirium is a common neurocognitive disorder in hospitalized older patients.

Covariates included age, sex, baseline mobility and functional status, preoperative cognitive impairment, and post operative complications were also assessed. Results: 247 older patients (mean age 85 \u00b1 6.9 years; Females = 208, 84,2%) who underwent surgery for a hip fracture were included. 104 subjects (41%) received a diagnosis of delirium. Patients with delirium showed higher pre-operative cognitive impairment (p = 0.0001), lower baseline functional status (p = 0.001) and were older than patients who did not experience delirium. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between MPI grade and delirium (p = 0.04). MPI score demonstrated a significant association with delirium (p \\ 0.0001). Overall, the incidence of delirium during hospitalization was significantly higher in patients with more severe MPI score.

We performed an exploratory analysis on the association between VT and delirium in a national multi-centre point prevalence study. Methods: A total of 2609 patients [ 65 years admitted to Medicine, Surgery, Geriatrics, Neurology and post-acute Rehabilitation wards during the Italian Delirium Day 2016 were included in the present analysis. Disability, history of dementia, multimorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index) and nutritional status were assessed. Delirium was defined with the 4-AT. Daily VT allowed in each ward was recorded. Results: Delirium was detected in 22% (N = 566) of patients. Patients with delirium were significantly older and had a higher prevalence of dementia, malnutrition, multimorbidity and disability. Daily VT was longer in wards hosting patients who experienced delirium (8.8 vs 7.7 h per day, p \\ 0.001) and was overall longest in Geriatric wards (11 h). However, the association between VT and delirium was not statistically significant after adjustment for age, dementia, disability, multimorbidity and malnutrition. Conclusions: Older patients, with worse clinical and functional profile and higher prevalence of delirium, are more often admitted to wards with longer VT, often Geriatrics wards, in Italian hospitals. Whether longer VT mirrors the need to care for an already complex patient or if it can be an effective strategy to reduce incident delirium should be assessed in future longitudinal, intervention studies.",

Surgery is the first-line treatment option for cancer, and fast-track surgery (FTS) has been documented to decrease postoperative complications. The study sought to assess, after comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and frailty stratification (Rockwood 40 items index), which perioperative parameters were predictive of POD development in elderly patients undergoing FTS for colorectal cancer. Methods: A total of 107 consecutive subjects admitted for elective colorectal FTS were enrolled. All patients underwent CGA, frailly stratification, Timed up & go (TUG) test, 4AT test for delirium screening, anesthesiologists physical status classification, and Dindo-Clavien classification. Results: The incidence of POD was 12.3%. Patients' prevalent clinical phenotype was pre-frail.

Our preliminary study of postoperative nocturnal hypoxia and intra-hospital complications including 46 patients, showed a significant association between the presence of nocturnal hypoxia and the occurrence of delirium (abstract 2017). To complete these results, the study's methodology was modified to control nocturnal oxymetry recording heterogeneity and also to collect daytime SpO 2 with the hypothesis that the post-operative nocturnal hypoxia in patients with HSF is associated with the occurrence of delirium. Methods: Patients hospitalized in orthogeriatric unit after HFS were monitored for nocturnal SpO2 with a pulse oximeter continuously up to 15 h, covering from one to three night(s). In-hospital complications were recorded in all patients, especially the occurrence of delirium with the CAM scale. Results: Interim analyzes are done on 38 additional patients included, with a mean age of 89,7 years, and a mean oxymetry recording of 601,73 min/night (10 h). The hypoxia vs non-hypoxia (time spent with SpO 2 \\ 90% more than 20%) groups will be analyzed for clinical characteristics, comorbidities and medication use. We will look for statistical association between severe post-operative nocturnal hypoxemia and occurrence of delirium, and if its association is independent from daytime SpO 2 .",

Methods: In an internal medicine ward, 455 old patients ([ 65) were admitted from January to September 2017; to 132 of them haloperidol was prescribed; the authors compared a 4 months period where no geriatric approach (GAP) was implemented with a 4 months period where selected patients (cognitive and/or recent functional impairment and/or falls) were submitted to a GAP, regarding to haloperidol prescription and administration. Results: On the period where no GAP was implemented, from a total of 253 old patients, 71 were prescribed haloperidol whereas only 23 (from a total of 202) had haloperidol prescribed when GAP was performed. In the first group, 44 patients had haloperidol administered; in the second group, 12 patients had haloperidol administered. The patients with GAP also received lower doses and different routes (intramuscular or oral) comparing to others (mainly intravenous). Discussion: -In the group where GAP was performed, haloperidol was less prescribed, less administered, in lower doses and different routes. The authors pretend to extend both groups to a bigger period to see if the results remain consistent. This work points out the crucial need of implementing a comprehensive geriatric assessment to old patients admitted in the hospital.",

No study has evaluated the association between delirium and anticholinergic load (AL) after HFS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of AL measured by all existing scales with delirium in this population. Methods: All patients admitted after HFS in the Geriatric Perioperative Unit (UPOG) were included. Delirium was diagnosed by a validated tool, the Confusion Assessment Method. AL was measured based on patients' computerized prescriptions and considered all treatments received during hospitalization. AL was evaluated by several scales: Drug Burden Index(DBI-Ach), Anticholinergic Drug Scale(ADS), Anticholinergic Risk Scale(ARS), Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale(ACB), Chew's scale(Chew), Anticholinergic Activity Scale(AAS), Anticholinergic Load Scale(ALS), Clinician-Rated Anticholinergic Scale(CrAS), Duran's scale(Duran) and Anticholinergic Burden Classification(ABC). Results: On the 53 patients included (mean age 86.9 \u00b1 5.4 years; 81.1% female), there was 39.6% of delirium. The mean \u00b1 SD AL(scale) was: 0.72 \u00b1 0.40(DBI-Ach), 1.39 \u00b1 0.95 (ACB), 0.28 \u00b1 1.26 (ARS), 0.55 \u00b1 0.89 (ADS), 0.73 \u00b1 1.30(ABC), 0.79 \u00b1 1.12 (Chew), 1.39 \u00b1 0.74 (Duran), 0.38 \u00b1 0.86 (AAS), 0.72 \u00b1 0.95 (ALS) and 1.45 \u00b1 1.08 (CrAS). No significant association was found between AL and delirium. Key conclusions: In patients after HFS managed in UPOG, no association between delirium and AL measured by the 10 existing scales was found.

The purpose of this study was to examine what, if any methods were used to assess cognition in older adults admitted acutely to an Irish hospital. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of a sample of acute medical admissions in patients over 75, between 25th February 2018-16th March 18 at Cork University Hospital. The type of cognitive assessment or delirium screening tools used were recorded. Results: Among the 35 charts reviewed, 17 (49%) had some form of cognitive screening or delirium assessment documented within 24 h of admission. 11 patients (31%) were documented as ''orientated to time, place, person'', while 3 (9%) had an Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), 1 patient had a 4AT, 1 patient was documented as ''orientated'' and 1 patient was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination. Conclusions: In our study only 49% of sampled patients had documentation of cognitive assessment within 24 h of admission. Our results suggest a need for improved documentation of cognitive status using a standardised approach to aid in identifying delirium and managing its risk factors. ",

The Emergency Department introduced the 4 at tool to its admission document to Eur Geriatr Med (2018) 9 (Suppl 1):S1-S367 S319 increase the rate of screening. Clinicians were prompted to screen both those who are confused and all patients over 65. Several initiatives have also been introduced to the department yet the screening rate of those over 65 remains below the target levels. Aims: This study aims to identify the reasons for the lack of screening. Methods: Surveys were conducted within the emergency department with nurses, advanced practitioners and doctors who were identified as the clinicians who should be screening. Surveys were also conducted with health care assistants and porters to establish wider opinions around delirium. Screening rates were compared with the 4 h wait target and the number of patients attending to establish if departmental pressures were a factor. Results: There is still a deficit in knowledge about delirium despite teaching on the subject. Clinicians also admitted to not screening all those over 65 due to doubts around the efficacy of screening over clinical judgement. Departmental pressures did not have a significant impact on screening rates. Conclusion: Though it is clear that the new pathway for delirium and the teaching has increased screening it is apparent that this is not enough to sustain a high screening rate. Changing attitudes of clinicians may require new approaches to teaching.

However, there is no scale to visualize the decision support in Japan. Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-Physician Version (SDM-Q-Doc) can measure and visualize the degree of shared decision-making through a medical interview between patients and doctors. We aimed to develop a Japanese version of SDM-Q-Doc thorough Japanese translation and psychometric testing. Methods: After obtaining approval from the copyright holder, we translated and back-translated between the original and Japanese versions of SDM-Q-Doc twice with the help of Japanese doctors. Participants were adult outpatients and their treating physicians who practiced family medicine. In total, 23 physicians rated their consultations with patients (n = 142) using SDM-Q-Doc at the first visit of each patient. Reliability and construct validity [exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA, respectively)] were assessed. For convergent validity, the Physicians' Confidence in the Medical Interview measure (PCMI) was used.",

Furthermore, we conducted a literature search, exploring the ethical concerns and considerations that might play in role in the decision whether or not to insert a PEG tube in a patient with severe dementia. Results: 303 patients were included, mean age of 77.4 years. 42 patients had cognitive disorders. In analyses adjusted for age and sex, patients with cognitive disorders had a 49% increase on risk of mortality (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01-2.19). A statistically significant difference was found for survival after PEG placement between the groups with and without cognitive disorders, there was no statistical difference in short-term complications. Discussion: We found higher mortality rates after PEG placement in patients with cognitive disorders when compared with patients without cognitive disorders. There are several possible mechanisms to explain this difference: the incurable nature of dementia, the increase of long term complications such as pressure ulcers and the increased need to use restraints to keep the tube in place. Ethical concerns and considerations: In the studied literature, it is shown that multiple ethical concerns and considerations play a role, both medical and nonmedical, such as: beliefs regarding the benefits of a PEG tube, a lack of knowledge about the natural course of dementia in both professionals and family of patients, and a fear of letting the patient die hungry.

The form of ODE we describe here concerns patients who are not unconscious and on life support, but who are conscious and want to have their life ended because of their hopeless and unbearable suffering, for instance due to a terminal illness such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This form of ODE is of course only possible in jurisdictions where euthanasia is allowed. In these jurisdictions, organ donation after euthanasia is an option that may be considered. We believe ODE is worthwhile to pursue, as it can strengthen patient autonomy, can give meaning to the inevitable death of the patient, and be an extra source of much needed donor organs. To ensure voluntariness of both euthanasia and organ donation and avoid conflict of interest by physicians, ODE does need strict procedural safeguards however. The most important safeguard is a strict separation between the two procedures. The paper on whitch this abstract is based discusses several ethical issues such as who should broach the subject of organ donation and who should perform the euthanasia, and how a conflict of interest can be avoided.",

Introduction: At the end of life, deep and continuous sedation practice require improvement in the monitoring of sedation and pain, in order to avoid the burden of unethical awake phases. Developed in anesthesiology, portable pupillometry is a nociception monitoring technique based on sympathetic and parasympathetic balance through pupil dynamic recording. It has never been used or evaluated in the palliative care complex framework near the end-of-life. We aimed to report clinical examples to provide primary evidence of the possible range of usefulness in end-of-life and palliative care practice. Methods: Case series using narrative clinical aspects and descriptive statistics. Results: We report 11 patients from a french palliative care unit. Age ranges from 22 to 97 years old. There are suffering complex health conditions and are exposed to multiple drugs to help symptom management. Light reflex might be progressively altered during sedation. Pain assessment might be possible using pupil dilatation recording during specific procedure. We observed a progressive alteration of light reflex until death. Intracerebral pathology might influence pupil size and dynamic (eg. vascular injury, septic embols for endocarditis, grade 4 glioblastoma). Instead of traditional scopolamine, butylbromure-scopolamine might not alter light reflex. Low dose infusion of ketamine might not influence pupil dynamic. Conclusion: Pupillometry seems to provide useful information about awakeness state, pain experience and pharmacological mecanism. It might be an effective technique to monitor pain and sedation in palliative care practice. However, our cases illustrate the need to properly define variability of pupil dynamic among palliative care patients in regards to complexity of physiological aspects of end-oflife, progressive organ failure and pharmacological influence.",

Some differences between physicians and older adults in component of good-death were apparent from previous study in Thailand. An educational programs have been implemented over few years. We explored the differences opinions between physicians and older people and the trend of change over 7-year period. Methods: We conduct a cross sectional study using 13-situationbased questionnaire which developed from literature reviews to explore perspectives on 'good-death'. Participants were older patients and physicians at a university hospital. The results were compared between 2 groups and to previous study and also compared the physicians' preferences for their EOL and what they would do for patients. Results: Three hundred fifty-two patients and 293 physicians were recruited. General concepts such as wishing to know the truth regarding prognosis, to treat suffering symptoms were important for most participants. Compared to previous study, higher proportion of physicians wished to tell all the truths about illnesses to patient (96.9% vs 88.1%, p\\0.001) and agreed with patients regarding not to prolong suffering (83.2% vs 71.0%, p\\0.001). When elicited opinion for their own EOL, higher proportion of physicians agree for most components in the questionnaire, particularly on not prolong suffering. Conclusions: Some difference in opinions regarding good death between patients and physicians remains. Nevertheless, the gap has been narrow over the past 7 year. Current scheme to promote knowledge regarding palliative care appears to be successful. Background: Advance chronic diseases and cancers are major causes of death among older patients. Appropriate palliative and end of life care would enhance death without suffering and reduce healthcare cost. Study that compared between cancer and non-cancer Thai patients regarding care for them are limited. Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients at least 60 years old admitted and discharged alive in 2013 was investigated. They were classified into cancer and non-cancer group, according to the study criteria. Healthcare utilization and advance directives were collected. Results were analyzed. Results: There were 306 older patients (130 of metastatic cancer and 176 of advance stage of non-cancer cases). Non-cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than those in cancer group. Advance directives before admission were conducted in 38.6% of non-cancer and 10.5% of cancer patients (p\\0.001). The median length of hospitalization of non-cancer group and the other group were 11 and 7 days, respectively (p \\ 0.001). In non-cancer patients, rate of invasive procedures such as endotracheal intubation were higher (p \\ 0.001). Health care cost (USD/patient/year) were 6790 and 3900 in non-cancer and cancer, respectively, p \\ 0.001). Time interval to dead from last discharge date in 2013 was significantly longer in the non-cancer group (476.9 VS 180.3 days, p \\ 0.001). Conclusion: In non-cancer group, health care utilization was higher than the other one. Palliative and end of life care should be considered in routine practice for caring of older patients with advance stage of illnesses, for the benefits of peaceful death and reduction in healthcare utilization.

The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between sleep duration and coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients and method: In this study, patients who applied to geriatric medicine outpatient clinic for comprehensive geriatric assessment were retrospectively studied. Optimal sleep duration was assumed to be 6 h and patients were divided into two groups; sleeping under 6 h and sleeping 6 h or more. Results: Total number of 2255 patients (age 72 \u00b1 6 years, 63.3% female) were included in this study. Patients who were sleeping less than 6 h were older (14.4% vs. 10.3%; p = 0.005) and female sex was higher (69.5% vs. 60.2%; p\\001).The frequency of CHD (31.9% vs. 25.9%; p = 0.003), falls (31.8% vs. 25.3%; p = 0.002), and depression (25.7% vs. 21.3%; p = 0.022) were higher, hypertension (68.5% vs. 72.5%; p = 0.049) was lower in the short sleep duration group.

Conclusion: Similar to the literature in our study, CHD was frequently observed in patients who had less than 6 h of sleep. Considering this relationship between short sleep duration and CHD, it is important to question sleep duration in comprehensive geriatric assessment.",

It's associated with comorbidities, functional deterioration, use of healthcare resources and increased mortality [2, 3] . Depression in the geriatric patient is underdiagnosed and treated incorrectly [5, 6, 7] . Methods: Cross-sectional observational study took place in Hospital Sant Jaume (Barcelona), patients recruited from February-2017 until February-2018. Patients included were attended in the convalescent service who have signed informed consent. Patients excluded were: not accept assessment, not understand test questions, have dementia, Mini-mental state examination (MMSE)\\24 points. Results: 100 patients were analyzed, 62 women and 38 men, between 58-99 years (y) and an average age of 78.60y(?/-10.95).Origin of the patients 47% of community(alone),47% community(living with relative),3% community(living with family worker) and 3% institutionalized. Diagnosis: 45% functional deterioration in relation to new diagnosis, 7% of which to acute cerebrovascular accident; 25% femur fracture; 16% exacerbation of chronic disease; 6% acute arterial ischemia with amputation; 4% due to ulcer healing; 1% due to insufficient social support. The prevalence of depression according to the clinical history was 31%. When screening: two question screener positive 82%, Yesavage scale positive 57%. Diagnosis with Hamilton scale it positive 61%. Use of psychotropic drugs present in 44% patients: 31% 1 drug, 19% 2 drugs, 3% 3 drugs and 1% 4 drugs. Type of psychotropic drugs used 31% antidepressants, 28% benzodiazepines, 6% antipsychotics, 7% antiepileptic. Key conclusions: Elderly patients have high prevalence of depression detected at screening or diagnostic and more frequently associated with greater social risk. Introduction: Sleep is a normal, transient, periodic and psychophysiological status that is caused by the decline in nervous sensation and voluntary muscle movements of organic activities. Sleep problems are highly prevalent in those over the age of 65, with up to 50-70% in some studies. In elderly population sleep disorders have been related with poor quality of health, falls, inappropriate medication use and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of sleep problems and their relationship between the possible factors in our outpatient clinic. Material and method: A retrospective review of medical reports of 295 patients, admitted (November 2013-November 2016) was conducted and the relationen sleep problems and age, gender, falls, fraility, restless leg syndrome (RLS) were evaluated. Results: 295 geriatric patients were included in the study. 66% (n = 196) of the patients was female and, remaining 34% (n = 99) male. Mean age was 75.6 \u00b1 6.8. Prevalence of sleep problems was 47.8%. In bivariate analysis, the relation between insomina and age, polypharmacy, RLS was significant. There was no statistically significant difference between both genders. In regression analysis, the association between sleep problems and age, polypharmacy and RLS was found independent. Conclusions: Sleep disorders in elderly is a major health problem affecting quality of life negatively and should be questioned during polyclinic visits. It should be kept in mind that the sleep problems may be related with important geriatric syndromes as polypharmacy.",

Introduction: Insomnia is a common complaint, particularly amongst elderly inpatients. It causes a significant negative impact on quality of life and daily functioning. Despite this, it is often poorly managed. The inappropriate first line prescription of sedating medication leads to adverse secondary consequences. To manage patients with insomnia effectively, it is key that healthcare professionals across all specialities have knowledge and understanding of insomnia diagnosis and management. Method: We surveyed staff on their knowledge in diagnosis and management of insomnia within an acute medical hospital (AMH) and a mental health hospital (MHH). The wards included: Geriatrics, Stroke, Diabetes, Orthopaedics, Elderly Frailty Unit within Emergency Department, Old Age and Adult Mental Health. The results between the two hospitals were compared. Results: 72 Questionnaires in total (39 at the AMH and 33 at the MHH). 93% had not received any training in insomnia. All the staff lacked knowledge in diagnosis and pharmacological management. 85% of the staff at the MHH were aware that non-pharmacological measures (for instance lifestyle and diet) are the first line management versus 54% at the AMH. Key conclusions: There is insufficient knowledge across both hospitals in diagnosis and pharmacological management. The increased knowledge of non-pharmacological management aspects within the MHH can be explained by increased awareness and emphasis of insomnia management as a factor in mental wellbeing and the part it plays in psychiatric illnesses. The overall gap in knowledge highlights the need for education and guidelines on insomnia to deliver the best appropriate care for our patients.",

Past medical history included hypertension, permanent pacemaker, Meniere's disease and anxiety. He was on Amlodipine, Citalopram and Betahistine. He was mobile with a stick and independent for ADLs.The nurse during preparation commented that while taking his observations he fell ''strangely''. Heart, chest, abdominal and full neurological exam was normal. After the consultation he stood and collapsed slowly in the chair, then he stood again steadily, walked outside the room without support. Approaching a chair he staggered, walked a step backwards and supported himself onto the wall until help came. Haematological and biochemical profile was normal. ECG showed paced rhythm and tilt table test revealed normal response. He had physiotherapy for 12 weeks. The therapist observed that he had an exaggerated response when balancing. For the subsequent 8 months he continued to fall three to four times daily but mostly managed to land safely on a near seat or against a wall. In the follow up clinics he displayed the same findings on standing and walking. His mild vestibular hypofunction did not explain the severity and extent of his symptomology. The pattern of falls, the frequency and duration without soft tissue or bone injury, with lack of signs or investigation result that can explain the falls supported a ''psychogenic ''cause. This was sensitively discussed with the patient but initially he resisted the concept. After reflection, 4 month later, he accepted the diagnosis. He was referred to and had eighteen sessions with a psychologist. When reviewed 10 months later he was definite that the frequency of falls had become less since the intervention. He had no falls during the next 15 months; but continued to stagger. In the clinics he was still observed to have staggering following standing or starting to walk, and if not supported he would adjust himself immediately or support himself against a wall. In one of the clinics he staggered on standing, a nurse ran to help him. His partner commented '' the less people there are the more steady he will be''. Then the patient started to fall again. Over the subsequent 3 years he was admitted seven times for a total of 63 days; with several investigations, courses of physiotherapy and addition of medications. When he was 92 years, he fell and fractured his neck of femur. It was difficult to diagnose the cause of his recurrent falls. Fear of falling is a well-known disabling consequence of falling. In our case there was another psychogenic element as well. The patient's falls were most likely due to conversion disorder; a functional neurological disorder. The patient was unlikely to be malingerer or factitious. The case demonstrated a rare cause for falls in older people; a conversion disorder. It showed how a psychogenic cause of falls could be difficult to diagnose, resistant to treat, protracted and costly with a serious devastating outcome. It is essential to consider and address the psychological element.",

Methods: Patients C 70 years old referred to geriatric oncology clinics were prospectively included. Depressive symptoms were used as indicators in a latent class analysis. Multinomial multivariable logistic regression and Cox models examined the association of each class with baseline characteristics and mortality. Results: For the 847 complete-case patients included (median age 79 years; women, 47.9%), we identified 5 depressive-symptom classes: ''somatic only'' (38.8%), ''pauci-symptomatic'' (26.4%), ''severe depression'' (20%), ''mild depression'' (11.8%) and ''demoralization'' (3%). Compared to the ''pauci-symptomatic'' class, the ''somatic only'' and ''severe depression'' classes were characterized by more frequent comorbidities with poorer functional status and higher levels of inflammation. ''Severe'' and ''mild'' depression also featured poorer nutritional status, more medications and more frequent falls. ''Severe depression'' was associated with poor social support, inpatient status and increased risk of mortality at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.48) and 3 years (1.49; 1.06-2.10). Conclusions: A data-driven approach based on depressive symptoms identified 5 different depressive symptom profiles, including demoralization, in older patients with cancer. Major depression was independently and substantially associated with poor survival.",

A 71-year-old gentleman who is a known case of Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus and depression was admitted to a long-term facility as his son could not keep up with his increasing need of care due to his deteriorating mobility. His main complaints were decreased mobility and nocturnal hallucinations for which he was recently started on olanzapine after a psychiatric review. History revealed full insight with hallucinations consisting of small animals and children playing which the patient did not believe to be true . They only happened at night in poor lighting. Examination revealed rigidity with resting tremor and difficulty mobilising. Both MMSE and Addenbrooke's cognitive assessment were done and failed to indicate any significant cognitive impairment. Formal ophthalmology review was done in view of longstanding diabetes which revealed background diabetic retinopathy in both eyes. Olanzapine was tailed down as diagnosis of psychosis was reconsidered and rigidity improved with no further instances of hallucinations experienced during his stay at the admission ward. The patient continued to improve in terms of mobility and independence as olanzapine was eventually stopped. At this point, several diagnoses were entertained including worsening of parkinsonian symptoms due to antipsychotic use in addition to release hallucinations. A formal psychiatric review was done which revealed a probable mixed aetiology for the hallucinations including Charles Bonnet syndrome, hypnopompic hallucinations and organic hallucinations. It was advised by the psychiatrist to keep off olanzapine and consider stopping nortriptyline. Patient was reassured.Patient continued to improve and eventually started walking independently, playing cards and fully independent in basic ADLs.",

Profile of depressive symptoms in older age is multidementional, may be less specific than in younger generations, and usually is complicated by multimorbidity. The aim of the study was to analyze profile of depressive symptoms in relation to their severity in community dwelling older adults, participants of the PolSenior project -the largest cross-sectional study of the aging population conducted between 2007 and 2011 in Poland. Materials and methods: The study group consisted of 4001 people aged C 65 years. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 15-Item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) administered by trained nurses. Individuals with moderate or severe dementia were excluded on the basis of Mini-Mental State Examination Test. Results: No depression (GDS score \\5) was diagnosed in 69.6%, moderate depressive symptoms (GDS score 6-10) in 25% and severe depressive symptoms (GDS score [ 10) in 5.4%. Depressive symptoms were more prevalent in women than men (36.9% vs 25.1%), and augmented with age. The least specific symptoms for depression were decline of activities, anxiety and preference to stay home, while the most specific symptoms for severe depression was: ''Do you think it is wonderful to be alive now?''. Conclusions: The profile of depressive symptoms may indicate severity of depression and may be useful in the assessment of older adults living in the community.",

A third of these AB prescriptions for UTI are not (yet) required. Inadequate AB use is associated with an increased risk of exposure to side-effects and drug interactions and plays an important role in the development of AB resistance. Recently, a UTI treatment decision tool for frail elderly was developed with the aim to reduce inadequate AB prescriptions in nursing NHs. Objectives: (1) to evaluate whether the use of the UTI treatment decision tool results in an increase in appropriate AB prescriptions for NH residents with suspected UTI (2) to investigate the degree, quality, facilitators and barriers of the use and implementation of the UTI treatment decision tool (process evaluation) Methods: Study design: 18-month pretest-posttest cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) with NHs as the unit of randomization Setting: 16 NHs in The Netherlands. Study population: NH residents with a new diagnosis 'suspected UTI'. Exclusion criteria: -Recent antibiotic use (past 7 days) for a different type of infection;-A treatment policy indicating that the resident wishes not to be treated with AB in case of a UTIIntervention: UTI treatment decision toolControl: care as usual Main outcomes: (1) Inadequate AB prescribing for suspected UTI at index consultation (yes/no). (2) Facilitators and barriers for implementing and using the UTI treatment decision tool. Results/conclusions: Expected in 2020. ",

            "text": "Constipation affects 14% of the global population. Older people are prone to constipation due to poor fluid intake, immobility, over use of laxatives and medication. Constipation may present as delirium, anorexia, food refusal, vomiting, faecal incontinence and urinary retention. The usual management is to prescribe oral laxatives, suppositories or enemas. Guidelines are available for the management of chronic constipation, but there appears to be little advice/ guidance on management in the acute setting. Methods: The medical records of 81 people admitted to an acute frailty ward were reviewed. Information regarding prescribing of laxatives (prior to admission or on admission), whether there was a duration of prescription documented, diagnosis of constipation (rectal examination or abdominal radiograph) and type of stool at the time for review. Results: 34 were male and 47 female; median age 87 years (50-95 years). On admission, 19 were taking previously prescribed laxatives. 66 were prescribed laxatives at the time of admission, 60/66 (90.9%) did not have an abdominal X-ray and 61/66 (92.4%) did not have a rectal examination (v 2 = 14.07, p \\ 0.01). There was no difference between age, nor stool Bristol stool type and laxative prescription. Only 7 (10.6%) had a review date for the prescription documented. Conclusions: The management of constipation is a common clinical problem. This study has found that prescription of laxative medication is often undertaken with no documented indication nor duration of treatment. Prescription of laxatives is not without potential consequences (e.g. electrolyte imbalance, dehydration) and prescription should be time limited and indication documented.",

Results: Among these patients, 27.1% showed significant changes between supine and sitting positions. The prevalence of SitHypo was 17.8% and of SitHyper 9.3%. SitHyper increases proportionally to the frailty status: 0, 9.4 and 16.9% respectively (age-and sex-adjusted values; p \\ 0.02). The frailty status did not influence the SitHypo. OrthHypo was more frequent than OrthHyper (19.6 and 2.8% respectively) and was more prevalent in frail patients.

Delirium Motor Subtype was assessed using the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale. Age, sex and hospital department affiliation were registered. Informed written consents were obtained from the patients or close relatives. Results: In total, 140 patients aged C 75 years (mean age 85.5 years, 54% women) were admitted during the study period, and 118 (84%) of these were included. Delirium was diagnosed in 16 (14%) of the patients. In addition, 37 patients (31%) had signs of cognitive impairment. Hypoactive (50%) was the most common delirium motor subtype, while 6% had hyperactive and 13% had mixed motor subtype. Patients with delirium or cognitive impairment were admitted to all hospitals and departments.

The present study compared between the ability of three cognitive screening tools-Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)-to predict functional rehabilitation outcomes at a department of geriatric rehabilitation. Methods: This prospective study included 212 patients aged 65 and older admitted to rehabilitation departments at a geriatric facility in central Israel, from April 2016 to October 2016. The cognitive functioning of each patient was assessed using the MMSE, MoCA, and IQCODE.

Additionally, recent studies suggest that some viruses, including the human papillomavirus (HPV), may play an important role in CVD pathogenesis by affecting atheromatous coronary arteries. Nevertheless, a potential association between HPV infection and coronary artery disease (CAD) in postmenopausal women remains unclear. Objective: To investigate a possible relation between HPV infection and CAD risk among postmenopausal women. Methods: The presence of both CAD and cervical HPV DNA was evaluated in 54 postmenopausal women. Sociodemographic variables and metabolic profiles were also obtained.",

(8) Assessment of postoperative functional recovery and the need for further rehabilitation. (9) Follow up of other chronic diseases and comorbidities e.g. Parkinson's disease, heart failure. (10) As a safety net to ensure action upon any unnoticed abnormal results, unintended omission of medications or the need to request further investigations. Conclusion: Some hip fracture patients need to be reviewed following hospital discharge to follow up postoperative complications or results of investigations, start or monitor osteoporosis treatment, reinstate or adjust some medications, follow up of chronic diseases and assessment of gait and risk of falls.",

Abdeljalil Anne-Bahia 1 , Rolland Yves 1 , Arbus Christophe 1 G\u00e9rontop\u00f4le Toulouse, Toulouse, FranceIntroduction: Depression is diagnosed in approximately 30% of the nursing homes (NH) residents but the pertinence of the high use of antidepressants is often criticized. Our aim was to determine the proportion of non-conforming antidepressant prescriptions among NH residents and the associated demographic and institutional factors. Method: Descriptive cross-sectional study of 2651 residents in 175 French NH participating in the IQUARE study (Impact of a QUAlity process on the development of practices and the functional decline of EPHAD Residents) and treated with antidepressants. Diagnosis of depression was obtained from the medical records. Antidepressant treatments were identified on the prescriptions and their conformance was analyzed in light of the international recommendations. Hydrocortisone butyrate is a medium potency topical steroid. Only low potency topical corticosteroids should be used in intertriginous/flexural areas affected by psoriasis, as absorption of steroids at these sites is rapid thereby increasing likelihood of systemic adverse effects such as iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This can be avoided by applying the right amount of adequately potent topical steroid measured in fingertip units once/twice daily for a period not exceeding 3 months. Conclusion: In adulthood, iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome should be considered when stronger than low potency topical steroids are applied sparingly on damaged skin especially in the flexures.",

Three weeks later, we notice a partial recovery of the renal Introduction: Anticoagulant activity monitoring is expected with unfractionated heparin (UFH), yet low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) monitoring by antifactor Xa (AFXa) is only recommended on therapeutic regimen among patients with renal insufficiency, extreme body weight or hemorrhagic history. AFXa should not be used for dose adjustment but only for overdose detection. In our study, anticoagulants were the drugs best known by the patients. PPIs were the most used, but less than half of the users knew what was for. Although less than 50% of oral antidiabetics users knew the drug, all of them knew the indication.Introduction:The proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are largely prescribed since the first one was released on 80 s. According to several studies, pneumonia, vitamin B12 deficiency, dementia, C. difficile infection, kidney disease and osteoporosis-related fractures have been addressed as long term adverse effects of using PPIs. The elderly population accounts for approximately one half of patients who are currently taking this class of drugs and almost 40% have no indication for being on PPI therapy.

Additionally elderly patients show a higher risk for malnutrition. For those affected, this can lead to longer hospital stays with increased morbidity and higher mortality. A few studies indicated the nutritional status and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing elective arthroplasty. On the basis of studies demonstrating the relevance of preoperative nutritional status in surgical patients this study aims to assess the prevalence of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and to assess whether preoperative nutritional parameters are associated with clinical outcome parameters. Only three patients with PEM died 12 months after OP. Conclusions: We observed a higher 6-month re-admission rate for malnourished patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty compared with well-nourished patients. We suggest that serum albumin and total lymphocyte count are valuable clinical markers evaluating the nutritional status and the clinical outcome. These results underline the importance of preoperative nutritional assessment of patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty.",

Conclusions: Although elderly patients undergoing surgery perceive significant anxiety they seem to be resilient to this and it does not affect their overall wellbeing. Patient's resilience, their anxiety and wellbeing evaluation should be taken into account in shared decisions making about whether or not to undergo surgery.Introduction: Increasing numbers of the oldest old present with hip fractures, driven by population ageing and high rates of injurious falls. Frailty and multimorbidity often lead to hesitation in offering surgery. Better data on outcomes can assist clinicians in evaluating the risks and benefits of operating on these vulnerable individuals. There are hospital factors, that include availability and timely replacement of mechanical prophylaxis. Also patient selfreported to assess response related satisfaction play an important role in non-compliance. Key conclusions: Deep vein thrombosis among elderly patients with hip fracture is preventable. Health care providers can overcome of these barriers to prevent complications.

In Genoa the Socio-Sanitary Districts approach a virtuous process of Primary Care and information for old people, to improve an active lifestyle using an Adapted Physical Activity (APA) process to contrast frailty and to prevent comorbidity and diseases. AimThe main goal for public health systems, is to create a new collaborative leadership and empowerment for a new health pro-active deal with many partners (social and private stakeholders together with citizens). Method: The study investigates: the APA process, based on the PDCA quality approach (Plan, Do, Check, Act), to support and to help the elderly with frailty and disabilities to socialize and enhance their own active life style the data analysis physical performances (balance, strength, and walking speed), and psychosocial dimensions (motivation and collaboration) are in progress. Preliminary study involves N = 316 elders (F = 80.1%; M age = 71.4 \u00b1 7.2 years; overweight T0 = 40.8%; M drugs a day T0 = 3) participated to an APA program. Results: Starting statistical analyses show significant results on physical autonomy (Barthel Index, SPPBT), reduction of pain and use of drugs. Moreover, significant improvement on physical performance (balance, strength, and walking speed), and on psychosocial dimensions (motivation and collaboration) were found. The study confirms scientific literature and indicates some directions to promote health and wellness for elders.Introduction: Insomnia causes significant distress and impaired functional state. Insomnia is very common: 37% of elderly inpatients have insomnia[1]. It is imperative that all healthcare professionals (HCP) in hospitals have a high-level of knowledge in all aspects of insomnia management. Methods: The multidisciplinary team (MDT) members within an acute medical hospital were surveyed on their knowledge in nonpharmacological and pharmacological management of insomnia. The MDT members included doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, a pharmacist, Healthcare Assistants and a medical student. Wards across Medical, Orthopaedics and the Emergency Department were surveyed. The results amongst the MDT groups were compared. Results: 39 Questionnaires in total (16 Doctors, 14 Nurses and 9 other MDT members). All MDT members lacked knowledge in both non-pharmacological and pharmacological management. Nurses were marginally more knowledge in different parameters of non-pharmacological management (such as lifestyle and diet). Key conclusions: Knowledge across the MDT in non-pharmacological and pharmacological management of insomnia was lacking. Nurses were slightly more knowledgeable compared to other MDT members. As this was not of a high standard no significant trends can be drawn between the MDT groups. To better patient care, guidelines are being developed for our acute medical hospital. It is time to wake up to the fact that education and training of HCP needs improvement in the management of insomnia. Reference: 1.

Introduction: National Audit Office UK (2015) stated 2.7 million bed days were occupied by patients no longer requiring an acute bed. Intermediate Care (IMC) rehabilitation supports those with reduced physical functioning, however often declines those with cognitive frailty. This creates prolonged deconditioning hospital stays, patient flow issues and endorses premature admission to 24-h care. We created a specialized MDT led rehabilitation unit for those declined by IMC. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 6 months of data, comparing functional scores from admission to discharge. We calculated the percentage of new 24-h care admissions in those over 80 entering hospital in comparison to the same period the year before. Results: 177 patients, 63% female and a median age of 85. 34% of admissions were from non geriatric wards, whom otherwise wouldn't have received a comprehensive geriatric assessment. 32% were admitted from acute care, demonstrating deflection of admissions into the main hospital. 67% of patients increased in weight, on average by 1 kg. Barthel (functional) index increased in 38% and the 6 m walking speed increased on average by 0.2 s. 74% patients returned to their own home. Despite a 6.6% increase in hospital admissions in those over 80, we contributed to creating a 11% decrease in new 24-h care placements (p-value 0.0486). Key conclusions: We have established a service for patients who were previously felt non-rehabable with subsequent prolonged hospital stays. In the appropriate environment their independence can improve reducing unnecessary long-term care admissions and support hospital flow. Both outcomes have positive health economic implications.[1]GREAT BRITAIN. Department of Health, Audit Commission for House of Commons. National Audit Office. (2016) Discharging older patients from hospital. London: Stationery OfficeKnowledge translation into practice: development of the Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg, aimed to improve functional performance of geriatric inpatients Background: A hospitalisation in older persons mostly results in functional decline, but concurrently a basic level of functional performance is warranted for a discharge home. From a physical perspective, key components to perform activities of daily living (ADL) in a safe way include muscle strength and power to stand up or move objects, balance to prevent falls, speed and endurance to perform and complete ADL in real life. Multicomponent exercise programs to prevent falls and strength training to improve functional performance in the older community dwelling population have been proven effective. However, literature on multicomponent exercise programs for geriatric inpatients with multimorbidity is lacking. Aim: To develop a week program specifically designed for geriatric inpatients, with the intention of working efficiently within the given physical therapy time and achieving a higher level of functional performance and thus independence. Result: Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg (GAPP); each weekday, 45 min a day, we focus on a different aspect of functional performance: Monday speed and endurance, Tuesday functional training, Wednesday balance, Thursday strength and Friday either evaluation by the Berg balance scale or a group session where all core elements come together. For each day we have proximally ten standard exercises adjustable to patients' capacity. To further increase the effect, all exercises are performed at high intensities according to existing guidelines.",

This risk increases with cognitive impairment (CI). Aim of this study: The investigation of the change of motor performance in geriatric patients with CI and HPF in the transition between inpatient rehabilitation and home environment. Methods: In 239 geriatric patients (85 \u00b1 6 years, Barthel Index: 78 \u00b1 13) with CI (Mini-Mental State Examination: 22.8 \u00b1 2.7) and HPF, motor performance (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), habitual gait speed, absolute duration of the SPPB Chair-Stand-Test) was assessed at the end of rehabilitation and after discharge to the home environment (29 \u00b1 15 days). An accelerometer-based motion sensor recorded detailed Sit-to-Stand/Stand-to-Sit transfer parameters. Dependent t-tests and effect sizes (Cohen's d; \\ 0.5 = small, 0.5-0.8 = medium, [ 0.8 = large) were calculated. Results: Due to nursing home admission (n = 18), death (n = 7), and other reasons (n = 23), 48 vulnerable patients could not be further investigated. Motor performance at follow-up revealed following significant (all p B 0.001) improvements: SPPB: Total-Score: 28 \u00b1 0.86 s vs. 1.92 \u00b1 0.59 s, d = 0.41. Conclusion: The results show a moderate improvement of motor performance within a comparatively short post-rehabilitation period in the majority of geriatric patients with CI after HPF.

The study objective was to describe LSM and identify sample-specific determinants in this high risk group for activity limitations. Methods: The cross-sectional study included 118 older communitydwelling, former rehab patients with mild to moderate CI. LSM was evaluated by the validated Life-Space Assessment in Persons with Cognitive Impairment (LSA-CI). Associations between LSM and physical, cognitive, psychosocial, environmental, financial and demographic participant characteristics, selected following a theoretical framework on LSM mobility, were calculated and then analyzed using linear regression analysis. Parameters were assessed by internationally established motor performance tests, sensor-based measures resp. standardized interviews. Results: Analysis revealed overall limited LSM in the group of multimorbid older persons (age: 82.3 \u00b1 6.0 years) with CI (Mini-Mental State Examination score: 23.3 \u00b1 2.4) with a wide range of restrictions. More than 30% of participants were confined to the neighborhood and half of all patients could not leave the bedroom without equipment or assistance. Physical performance, social activities, physical activity and gender were identified as independent determinants of life-space mobility and explained 42.4% (adjusted r 2 ) of the LSA-CI's variance in the regression model. Key conclusions: This study documents the highly restricted LSM of a vulnerable study population. Identified determinants may represent potential targets for future life-space interventions. A gender specific approach may help to address more advanced restrictions in women.Department of Geriatric Research, AGAPLESION BethanienHospital Heidelberg, Geriatric Center at the Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany, 2 Department of Health and Social Affairs, FHM Bielefeld, University of Applied Sciences, Bielefeld, Germany",

They are associated with prolonged hospital stay, worsened immobility, disability, institutionalisation and cause added use of monetary resources (e.g. 4233 USD per patient). Effective fallprevention is based on fall-risk screening and multifactorial interventions. The LUCAS fall-risk screening was developed and validated based on the widely used STRATIFY screening. However, LUCAS consists of fewer fall-risk factors and is more suitable to define a dedicated high-risk group. The rationale was to perform an economic evaluation of a multifactorial fall-risk prevention concept in a German geriatric clinic using either the LUCAS or the STRATIFY fall-risk screening. DS1, LUCAS: DS2). Sensitivity analyses examined robustness. Questionnaires were used to calculate costs for personnel and materials necessary for the fall prevention intervention concept.

Denizli, TurkeyIntroduction: In patients with COPD, respiratory dysfunction causes a decrease in extremity function, exercise performance, reduced skeletal muscle strength, and severe limitations in physical functioning. Further deterioration in pulmonary function is the factor that affects the worsening of physical performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between respiratory functions and functional performance in elderly COPD patients. Methods: Forty-four patients who were referred to the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation unit of the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation of Pamukkale University were included in this study. Respiratory function tests of the subjects were performed with a portable spirometer according to the ATS-ERS guidelines. The Turkish version of Functional Performance Scale (FPS) was used in the evaluation of functional performance. Results: Thirty-one (70.45%) male 13 (29.55%) female subjects with a mean age of 68.08 \u00b1 11.15 were included in the study. The average of total score of FPS was 68.81 \u00b1 34.20, Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score was 1.78 \u00b1 0.96 and the average results of Pulmonary function test were as %FEV1 = 62.68 \u00b1 17.21, %FVC = 68.74 \u00b1 11.14, %FEV1/FVC = 89.12 \u00b1 22.76,%PEF =  64.22 \u00b1 19.45,. When the relation between respiratory functions and FPS was examined, there was a significant correlation between FEV1, FVC, MEF25-75 and FPS total score (p \\ 0.05, r = 0.63). Key conclusions: As a result of our study, it was found that in elderly COPD patients, there was a relationship between respiratory functions, dyspnea level and functional performance. Elderly patients with COPD have limitations in their physical exercise and body-care activities as their respiratory functions and dyspnea deteriorate.Benefits of geriatric day hospital in patients with hip fracturePaulo Almeida 1 , Raquel Sosa 2 , Pilar Cabezas 2 , Arturo Sevillano 2 , Sofia Duque 3 , Carlos Verdejo 2 CHBV, Aveiro, Portugal, 2 HCSC, Madrid, Spain,3  CHLO, Lisboa, PortugalIntroduction: Geriatric Day Hospital (GDH) is an interdisciplinary hospital care model, which main objective is functional rehabilitation of geriatric patients. The study aim is to analyse demographic and clinical data of patients submitted to hip fracture (HF) surgery and investigate their functional rehabilitation in GDH after hospital discharge. Methods: Observational and longitudinal study by process analysis and observation of patients submitted to HF surgery, followed in GDH for 8 months. Demographic, clinical, and laboratorial variables were measured; functional assessment scores were calculated before HF, at admission and discharge of GDH. Statistical analysis in SPSS. Results: 32 patients (mean age 86.2 \u00b1 4.8 years and 78% women) were included. 56.3% came from the Convalescence Unit (CU). Most frequent comorbidities: osteoarthrosis (84.0%), visual impairment (46.9%) and depression (34.4%). There was a functional decline between the period before HF and admission to GDH [mean Barthel's Scale (BS) value from 89.9 \u00b1 13.1 to 69.8 \u00b1 14.3] and improvement of functional status between admission and discharge of GDH (mean BS value from 69.8 \u00b1 14.3 to 85.5 \u00b1 11.6). The use of physical aids for gait decreased (from 87.5 to 77.0%) and polypharmacy was reduced (mean of drugs from 10.6 \u00b1 2.9 to 8.5 \u00b1 2.9). The Mann-Whitney test showed improved Short Physical Performance Battery values in patients from CU. A positive association was found between Timed Up and Go test values improvement and vitamin D higher levels (Spearman's Rho (17) = 0.528).Conclusions: Follow-up in GDH and multidisciplinary approach in patients submitted to HF surgery are associated with improved functional rehabilitation and reduced polypharmacy.Improving the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in older patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery Aine Goggins 1 , Vivien Nebo 1 , Cathryn Mainwaring 1 , Jugdeep Dhesi 1 Guy's & St. Thomas Hospital, London, UK Introduction: Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is common in older patients undergoing elective joint arthroplasty (EJA)(1). Testing for ASB is frequently undertaken at preoperative assessment (POA) due to historical concerns over possible spread to the prosthesis. This leads to unnecessary testing, delays in surgery & antimicrobial overuse. A systematic review carried out at our centre found no evidence to support routine MSU/urinalysis in the perioperative setting. Methods: 1st stage: Patients undergoing EJA from both the pre-operative assessment unit (POAU) and Proactive care of older people undergoing surgery (POPS) clinics at our centre were analysed. Of 180 patients, a total of 93 pre-operative MSUs were sent, 67 of which were in asymptomatic patients with no clear indication for testing documented. 2nd stage: We developed and implemented a MSU testing decision tool, based on NICE and SIGN guidance. All stakeholders approved the tool. Staff education and posters were used to facilitate this practice change. Rolling data was collected over 3 months to assess adherence to the decision-support tool in both POPS and POA unit. Conclusion: Of 49 patients undergoing EJA in this time period only 2 MSUs were sent preoperatively; 1 appropriately and 1 inappropriately, resulting in 98% adherence to the decision support tool. Our simple decision flow chart has almost eliminated inappropriate MSU testing of ASB in the POA of older orthopaedic patients undergoing PJI. It is clear that the implementation of similar tools in other orthopaedic outpatient settings would lead to reduced costs, cancellations and improved antibiotic stewardship.We must give the elderly a chance-it is our responsibility: homebased rehabilitation Roni Gagin 1 , Neta HaGani 1 , Itay Levy 1 , Moriya Gozlan 1 , Doron Norman 1 Social Work Department, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel",

Responses to bolus water drinking, grade 2 full leg compression stockings, abdominal compression, leg and abdominal compression, physical-counter manoeuvres (PCMs) were evaluated. Results: Participants were aged 60-92 (median 74). Water drinking was efficacious in 56% (95% CI 34.9, 75.6). This was generally considered acceptable, but with concerns around urinary frequency. PCMs were efficacious in44% (24.4, 65.1)  and were considered the most acceptable as they are discreet and no equipment is required. There were mixed views on the acceptability of abdominal compression which was efficacious in 52% (31.3, 72.2). Stockings were considered unacceptable due to difficult application/removal and were the least efficacious, 32% (15, 53.5). Leg and abdominal compression were efficacious in 52% (31.3, 72.2). There were no adverse events. Conclusions: Bolus water drinking and PCMs are safe, efficacious and acceptable. Stockings were unacceptable and the least efficacious and should be disregarded as first-line therapy. There is no additional benefit gained by adding leg compression to abdominal compression.The management of complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a geriatric Rehabilitation Hospital in Malta S. Cauchi 1 , F. Farrugia 1 , M. A. Vassallo 2 Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta, 2 Rehabilitation Hospital Karin Grech, Guardamangia, MaltaIntroduction: The aims of this study were to compare the current management of ophthalmic and podology complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a Geriatric Rehabilitation Hospital in Malta to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Guidelines[1, 2]. Methods: All the patients with T2DM admitted in all the wards in the Geriatric Rehabilitation Hospital over a period of 2 weeks were included in the study. The data collection included basic demographic data, the physical examination findings in the patient's file, the documented referral to ophthalmic and podology services and the most recent level of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Results: A total of 78 patients had T2DM; 69% were prescribed oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs), 17% had insulin and 14% of patients were prescribed both OHAs and insulin. 50% of patients did not have documented physical findings of peripheral vascular disease or ophthalmic complications. 14% of patients had ulcers and sores on physical examination, 9% of patients had documented cataracts and 9% had no complications of note. 29.5% of patients had both an ophthalmic and podology review, 19% had a documented podology review and 11.5% had a documented ophthalmic review within the previous year. 76% of patients had an HbA1c level taken within the previous 6 months. Key conclusions: Health care professionals should ensure that referrals and follow-up appointments for podology and ophthalmology are offered to type 2 diabetic patients.References: 1.

This systematic review aims to summarise the evidence on the effects of nutritional interventions on nutritional and functional outcomes in patients in geriatric rehabilitation. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched to identify relevant nutritional intervention studies in patients aged C 60 years, admitted to a geriatric rehabilitation setting. A meta-analysis was performed on the intervention effect on Barthel Index (BI) and serum albumin. Results: Of the 1441 studies screened, 14 eligible intervention studies were identified: 3 nutritional interventions (supplements with 20-30 g protein/day), 6 nutritional interventions (vitamin D, supplements with 10-32 g protein/day) combined with a physical exercise program, 1 study on timing of protein provision, 2 interventions providing dietary advice combined with exercise sessions, and 2 interventions with nutrition-related nursing care. Studies were heterogeneous in outcomes measured. Nutritional supplements that contain protein increased protein intake. The effect on physical function (BI, functional independence measure (FIM), hand grip strength, mobility, muscle strength) was limited, however, some individual studies showed positive effects. Meta-analyses showed no significant intervention effect on serum albumin (mean difference 0.45 g/L, 95% CI -0.62:1.52; 3 studies) and BI (mean difference 2.25 points, 95% CI -3.90:8.40; 4 studies). Conclusion: Nutritional interventions increase protein intake. Effects on physical function are limited. However, due to heterogeneity in interventions and outcome measures it is not possible to draw a clear conclusion on the effect of nutritional interventions in geriatric rehabilitation.Agaplesion Bethanien Hospital Heidelberg, Geriatric Center at the University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany",

The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition in a geriatric rehabilitation population. Methods: For this observational study, participants were consecutively recruited from September 2015 to September 2016 in a geriatric rehabilitation center in Oldenburg, Germany. At admission the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) was applied, and malnutrition was diagnosed by the new ESPEN classification, which includes a parameter for body composition (fat free mass). Results: 122 patients [70% women, mean (SD) age 81.5 years (5.6)] were included; for all of them MNA-SF was completed, the ESPEN classification was applied in 102 patients, because of missing information on fat free mass index, e.g. due to a pacemaker. According to MNA-SF, the prevalence of malnutrition was 31% (n = 38); 60% (n = 73) were at risk of malnutrition; 9% (n = 9) were malnourished according to the ESPEN classification. Eight out of nine malnourished patients (ESPEN criteria) were also malnourished according to MNA-SF. 72% (n = 24) of the patients identified as malnourished by MNA-SF were not diagnosed as being malnourished by the ESPEN criteria. Key conclusions: The prevalence of malnutrition in a geriatric rehabilitation population differs according to method of diagnosis, higher with MNA-SF (31%) than ESPEN (9%), the availability of body composition data limited the use of ESPEN diagnosis in this study. As functional items are included in MNA-SF, this tool has a broader scope than the ESPEN classification for malnutrition.Sarcopenia and malnutrition in a german geriatric rehabilitation populationJulia Wojzischke 1 , Sarah Egert 2 , Andreas Hein 1 , J\u00fcrgen M.

The current recommendation regarding daily protein intake is [ 1.2 g/kg/bw in individuals with acute diseases, including hip fracture. Nutritional care in geriatric rehabilitation (GR) needs a multidisciplinary approach. The purpose of the present study was to gain insight into patient characteristics and the current situation regarding nutritional care in GR (protocols, communication, intervention). Methods: First, data including physical functioning, muscle mass, comorbidities, nutritional status and protein intake was gathered from 40 hip fracture patients on admission to two GR units. Protein intake measurements were repeated after three weeks to detect possible changes over time. Secondly, semi-structured interviews were performed to gain insight in the given usual care [physical therapists (n = 4), dietitians (n = 3), physicians (n = 2), nursing staff (n = 4)]. Results: Of the study population 74% were women. Mean age was 81.4 (SD 8 years). 11% of patients, were classified as undernourished and a further 59% as at risk of malnourishment. 95% of patients did not meet the recommendation for daily protein intake and intake did not significantly change over time. Data from the semi-structured interviews showed that the involved care-providers are aware of the importance of adequate nutrition in rehabilitation, but this knowledge is not implemented. Conclusion: Malnourishment and insufficient protein intake are highly prevalent in older hip fracture patients visiting GR's. These results point to a compelling need to improve the organization of nutritional care.",

Predictor factors of increased length of stay of older patients with hip fracture in an Orthogeriatric Unit Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Hospital de S Francisco Xavier, Lisbon, Portugal, 2 Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental, Hospital de S. Francisco Xavier, Lisbon, PortugalIntroduction: Orthogeriatric Units provide a multidisciplinary approach to the care of older patients with hip fracture, enhancing functional rehabilitation, minimizing complications and mortality, reducing time to surgery and length of stay (LOS), as already demonstrated in our unit. The analysis of factors related to increased LOS for these patients is important, since it may allow further optimization of the care provided. Objectives: To identify sociodemographic characteristics, global geriatric assessment indexes, or other factors associated with hospitalization that may be associated with an increase in length of stay, in patients over 64 years-old with hip fracture, admitted to an Orthogeriatric Unit. METHODS: Retrospective study between June 2016 and March 2018 carried out by the consultation of the electronic processes. Comparative analysis of the characteristics of two groups of patients, divided in less than 13 days VERSUS equal to or greater than 13 days (median of LOS). Binary logistic regression performed for predictors of prolonged hospitalization. Results: Of the 271 patients assisted, 131 (48.7%) had hospitalization lasting 13 or more days. In the group with increased hospitalization time, there were significantly more men [29.8% (n = 39) vs 18.1% (n = 25), p = 0.025] and they presented a longer time-to-surgery (6.96 vs 2.6 days, p = 0.001).Even not yet statistically significant, this group was also more dependent (average Barthel score 82.4 vs 79.1/100, p = 0.072). There were no other independent factors predicting prolonged LOS, namely age, place of residence before hospitalization, educational level, marital status, type of femoral fracture, destination after discharge, the presence of delirium, autonomy for walking at discharge, index of comorbidities (Comorbidities Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics), cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, or nutrition status. Conclusion: Male gender and a longer time to surgery seem to be related with increased LOS. While measures to improve the modifiable factors may be implemented, a bigger and more detailed prospective study may help to identify other predictors, aiming to improve care and allow a further decrease hospitalization time.Predictor factors of increased time to surgery of older patients with hip fracture in an Orthogeriatric Unit Introduction: Orthogeriatric Units have improved the care of the elderly patient with hip fracture, minimizing complications due to a multidisciplinary approach. Some authors have showed that Orthogeriatric Units approach reduced Time To Surgery (TTS) as well as mortality and length of stay (LOS). The analysis of factors related to increased TTS is still important, since it may allow further optimization of the care provided. Objectives: To identify sociodemographic characteristics, global geriatric assessment indexes, or other factors associated with hospitalization that may be related to an increase in TTS, in patients over 64 years-old with hip fracture, admitted to an Orthogeriatric Unit.Methods: Retrospective study between June 2016 and March 2018 carried out by the consultation of the electronic processes. Comparative analysis of the characteristics of two groups of patients, divided in TTS till 4 days VERSUS greater than 4 days (median of TTS in this sample). Binary logistic regression performed for predictors of prolonged time to surgery. Results: Of the 271 patients assisted, 135 (49.8%) had a time to surgery of more than 4 days. In the group with higher TTS, there were significantly less patients with adequate nutritional status [14 (10.3%) vs 17 (12.6%), p = 0.11], and lower prevalences of cognitive impairment [42 (30.9%) vs 64 (47.4%), p = 0.034].Even not yet statistically significant, this group was also more dependent (average Barthel score 81.47 vs 79.7/100, p = 0.088) and took more drugs previously to admission (6.92 vs 6.64, p = 0.062). There were no other independent factors predicting increased time to surgery, namely age, gender, place of residence before hospitalization, years of schooling, marital status, type of femoral fracture, destination after discharge, the presence of delirium, autonomy for walking at discharge, index of comorbidities (Comorbidities Illness Rating Scale-Geriatrics). Conclusion: Variables related to patients' physical frailty, such as malnourishment, polypharmacy and dependency seem to be related to an increased TTS. However, cognitive frailty didn't seem to have an impact on delay of surgery. While measures to improve the modifiable factors may be implemented, a bigger and more detailed prospective study may help to identify other predictors, aiming to improve care.ACANTO project: short physical performance battery evaluation after intervention with a friendly robotic walker (FriWalk) during admission in Acute Care Unit and Orthogeriatrics Unit.Introduction: ACANTO is an European project funded by the EU Horizon 2020 program aimed at improving physical performance in elderly people through a robotic friendly walker (FriWalk). The aim of the project is to compare the evolution of the participants in terms of physical performance during admission measured by Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at admission and at discharge. Methods: A total of 22 patients aged + 75 admitted in the Acute Care and Orthogeriatrics units of the Getafe University Hospital (Madrid) were analysed. Participants were randomized into one of the study groups: an intervention group where participants received an individualized multicomponent physical exercise program provided by the FriWalk during hospitalization; and a control group where patients received the usual care, also during hospitalization. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate the change in SPPB attributable to being randomized to the intervention group. Analyses were adjusted by age and sex and a p value threshold of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Physical performance, measured by SPPB, at discharge was significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group. These patients improved 1.03 points in the SPPB score [95% CI (0.31-1.77), p = 0.02]. There were no significant differences in mean baseline SPPB score. Conclusions: Results indicate that patients who have used the Fri-Walk during hospitalization in the Acute Care and Orthogeriatric Units have a better evolution in terms of physical performance measured by SPPB.ACANTO project: recruitment description on elderly admitted into Geriatrics departments through the use of a robotic friendly walker Introduction: ACANTO is an European project funded by the EU Horizon 2020 program aimed at improving physical performance in elderly people through a robotic friendly walker (FriWalk). A pilot study undertaken at Getafe Hospital (Madrid) compares the effectiveness of FriWalk. In the intervention group, the FriWalk provided a means to carry out physical tasks during the hospitalization in the Acute care and Orthogeriatric units. In the control group, usual care was being delivered. The aim of the project was to verify that the randomization was correctly performed and to know the characteristics of the sample.Methods: A total of 25 patients aged 75 + were included while they were hospitalized in the Acute Care and Orthogeriatric. Participants were randomized into the intervention or the control group. A transversal analysis has been performed to evaluate the collected data. Results: 25 patients were analysed. In the control group 14 patients were recruited: 35.7% men, mean age of 88.14, 85.7% frail, 14.3 prefrail, mean gait speed in 6 m of 0.48 m/s and mean Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) of 4.0. In the intervention group, 11 patients were recruited: 45.5% men, mean age of 89.18, 81.9% were frail, 18.2% were prefrail, mean gait speed in 6 m of 0.42 m/s and mean SPPB of 3.73. No significant differences were identified. Conclusion: The randomization was properly performed, so the different groups are comparable. In both groups, most of the participants were frail according to Fried Frailty Criteria, with a low SPPB and slow gait speed.Floris 9 , M. Pizzonia 10 , A. Barone 11 , A. March 12 , A. Ungar 13 , V.

Methods: Prospective, descriptive and unicentric study of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis were evaluated by a geriatrician from April 2016 to December 2017. An interdisciplinary team decided the treatment for each patient [medical treatment, TAVI and aortic valve replacement (AVR)]. Socio-demographic variables (age, sex) were registered. Functional and cognitive status were evaluated before and 3 months after TAVI. Functional status was performed by Barthel index (BI), Lawton index (LI) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Short Physical Performance Battery values the balance (4 points), gait speed (4 points) and muscle strength of the lower extremities (chair stand test) (4 points). Cognitive status was performed by Mini-Mental of Folstein (MMSE). Results: Fifty-nine patients were evaluated (55.93% women); mean aged 81.55 \u00b1 6.24 years. Twenty-nine patients received medical treatment, 23 TAVI and 7 AVR. Three patients who received TAVI treatment refused follow-up by geriatrician. Mean of the parameters evaluated before TAVI: LI:5.80 \u00b1 1.90; BI:98.35 \u00b1 4.92; SPPB:8.30 \u00b1 2.53; SPPB (balance):3.35 \u00b1 0.81; SPPB (gait speed):3.05 \u00b1 0.88; SPPB (chair stand test):1.90 \u00b1 1.16; MMSE:27.00 \u00b1 2.92.

In ESPEN consensus statement (2015), new criteria was suggested for screening of malnutrition. The aim of our study was to compare ESPEN 2015 criteria with MNA, for success on detection of malnutrition, in patients from our outpatient geriatric clinic. Methods: November 2015-January 2018 were included patients in to the study. MNA, ESPEN test screening, hand grip strength (HGS), age, gender, weight were recorded. Body mass index (BMI) \\ 18.5 kg/m 2 and fat free mass index \\ 15 kg/m 2 for female and \\ 17 kg/ m 2 for male with involuntary weight loss or BMI values \\ 20 kg/m 2 (\\ 70 years old) and \\ 22 kg/m 2 ([ 70 years old) are accepted as malnutrition (ESPEN) \\ 11 point for short-form MNA and \\ 23.5 point for long-form MNA was accepted as malnutrition. Findings: 438 geriatric patients were included in our study; 34.5% was male, and 65.5% female. Mean age was 75.0 \u00b1 6.2 (65-97). Mean BMI was 29.4 \u00b1 5.4. According to MNA, sensitivity and specificity of ESPEN criteria was 64.3 and 80.4%. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ESPEN criteria was found 9.8 and 98.6% respectively. HGS in malnourished group according to MNA test was statistically low (p = 0.004). BMI was significantly lower in malnourished group according to both MNA and ESPEN criteria (p \\ 0.001). Conclusion: Due to the low sensitivity and PPV of ESPEN 2015 criteria, it is considered that use of ESPEN 2015 criteria for screening of malnutrition may not be appropriate. However, ESPEN 2015 is found to be very effective for determination of elderly patients without malnutrition.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of the association of inflammation and depressive symptoms in elderly patients at risk for malnutrition and/or malnutrition. Methods: 217 individuals aged 65 years and over admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Geriatric Medicine at Gaziantep University Hospital for routine medical care were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment tests via one-on-one interview method. Results: The median age of patients was 72.48 \u00b1 5.98 years and the age range was between 65 and 90 years. A total of 128 patients (59%) were female and 89 (41%) were male. According to mini-nutritional assessment short form (MNA-SF) 41 (18.9%) were in malnutrition group, 82 (37.8%) were in malnutrition risk group, and 94 (43.3%) were in normal nutritioneal status. In malnutrition group, 51.2% had elevated CRP levels and 70.7% had depressive symptoms. In malnutrition risk group, 39.0% had elevated CRP levels and 70.7% had depressive symptoms. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between MNA-SF score with geriatric depression scale short form (GDS-SF) score and CRP levels (r: -0,201, p: 0,003, r: -0,495, p: 0,000, respectively). The incidence of association of inflammation-depression in elderly patients with malnutrition and malnutrition risk was 36.6% and 12.2%, respectively. Conclusion: Depression and inflammation can accompany each other at an important frequency in elderly malnutrition patients.Management of older patients with diabetes in primary careresults from SloveniaMarija Petek \u0160 ter 1 , Barbara JemecZalar 1    Department of Family Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Poljanski nasip 58, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronical diseases in multimorbid elderly population. The aim of the research was to recognise the basic characteristics of elderly patients with diabetes, quality of process of care and outcomes in elderly patients with diabetes in Slovenia. Methods: In a cross sectional study, family physicians from different regions of Slovenia included data for consecutive patients with diabetes aged 65 or over. Data about the comorbidities, process of care and outcomes were retrieved from patient's medical record. Results: In the sample there were 226 patients; 115 female (50.9%) and 111 male (49.1%) from 65 to 93 years (mean 73.7, SD 5.6 years); were included. Depression was documented in 11.1% of patients. 18.2% were treated with diet only, 62.7% taking oral antidiabetics and 19.1% insulin. 36.5% of patients had micro or macrovascular complications of diabetes. The mean HbA1c was 7.0%. Foot examination in the last year was made in 81.0% and eye examination in 70.2% of patients. 74.3% of patients reached individually determined value of HbA1c, 68.0% had their blood pressure under the control and 54.5% reached the target values of LDL. Conclusions: Patients with diabetes underwent interdisciplinary team management were carefully followed and in high percentages reached the target values of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In the future more effort should be put in more individualised treatment plan for multimorbid patients with diabetes.Predictors of mortality in geriatric patientsSiddarth Agrawal 1 , Mateusz Luc 1 , Filip Winkowski 1 , Karolina Lindner 1 , Anil Kumar Agrawal 1 , Marta Wo\u017aniak 1 , Ma\u0142gorzata Sobieszcza\u0144ska 1 Department and Clinic of Geriatrics, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, PolandEarly identification a risk of mortality is crucial to provide adequate interventions and healthcare resources in elderly patients. The aim was to determine the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in 208 patients admitted to the geriatric ward in 2013 year. A retrospective analysis on the patients' status at hospital admission and a primary outcome of 4-year mortality were used. Results: The mortality rate was 26%. Age, red blood and white blood cells count, as well levels of C-reactive protein, albumin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly correlated with mortality. The presence of some clinical symptoms, i.e., pressure ulcers and weakened consciousness was predictive of poor outcome. Multidimensional aspects of aging assessed in the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Barthel scale, Mini Mental State Examination, Clock Drawing Test) appeared to be strong predictors of 4-year mortality. The probability of mortality based on the examined variables correctly classified nearly 85% of the analyzed cases. Conclusion: Early detection of high-risk patients could enable to reach longer life-span in the elderly.G\u00fcl\u00e7imen Soylu 1 , Yusuf Yalva\u00e7 2 , Funda Datl\u0131 Yakary\u0131lmaz 1 , Zeynel Abidin \u00d6 zt\u00fcrk 1",

            "text": "Background: The aim of this study was to describe clinical, biological and pathological features of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in patients older than 75 years and to compare them to younger patients with GCA. Methods: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive study in the department of internal medicine at la Rabta Hospital, over a 16-year period. Ninety six patients were diagnosed with GCA according to the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of giant cell arteritis. Results: Thirty five patients with CGA were aged more than 75. Sexratio M/W was 1.69. Mean age at diagnosis was 79.26 \u00b1 3.3 years. Median delay to diagnosis was 1.75 months [extremes 0 and 24 months]. Disease was mostly revealed with headache (65.7%). Constitutional symptoms and fever were noted in 54.3 and 31.4% of patients respectively. Headache was the most frequent sign (97.1%). Jaw claudication and scalp tenderness were found in 74.3 et 42.8% of patients respectively. Polymyalgia rheumatica was diagnosed in 45.7% of patients. On physical examination, abnormal temporal artery was found in 91.4% patients. Thirteen patients (37.1%) had ocular involvement (ischemic optic neuropathy in all of them). Laboratory markers of inflammation were positive in 94.2% of patients. Temporal artery biopsy showed compatible pathology report in 75% of cases. Jaw claudication (p = 0.009) and high gammaglobulin rate (p = 0.018) were significantly more frequent in patients older than 75 years. Conclusion: GCA characteristics in patients older than 75 years were similar to other ethnic groups and to younger patients.Predictive model for one year mortality in a geriatric acute unit C.

Geriatric depression scale (GDS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Katz index of activities of daily living (ADL), Lawton Brody index of the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), short form of the Mini Nutritional Assessment Tool (MNA-SF), Tinetti Gait and Balance Test were applied to all participants. Results: 198 patients out of 345 were diagnosed with MS. The mean age of MS and non-MS were 71.5 and 72.6, respectively (p = 0.07). The average number of drugs taken by MS patients and non-MS were 4.4 and 3.1, respectively (p\\0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in ADL, IADL, MMSE, GDS, MNA, falling risk, sleep quality and quality of life in elderly patients with and without MS. Conclusion: Increasing chronic diseases with advancing age affect the quality of life in all fields. In our study; chronic diseases are common in geriatric population thus there was no significant difference in sleep and life quality among those who are diagnosed with or without MS.Morbidity indicators inTunisian elderly: results of the Tunisian health examination survey Zoghlami N 1 , Ben Mansour N 2 , Guezmir K 3 , Saidi Olfa 4 , Skhiri Afef 5 , Ben Slema1 Fathi 1 , Lamloum M 6 , Hsairi M 7 , Skhiri1 H Aounallah 8 Institut National de la Sant\u00e9, Tunisie INSP, Tunis, Tunisia, 2 Institut National de la Sant\u00e9, Tunisie INSP, Tunis, Tunisia, 3 Laboratoire de recherche en \u00e9pid\u00e9miologie et pr\u00e9vention des maladies cardiovasculaires, FMT, Tunis, Tunisia, 5 Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine de Tunis, Universit\u00e9 Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia",

Method: Observational prospective multicenter cohort study conducted by the French Infectious Diseases and Geriatrics societies network. Setting and Participants: Patients aged C 75 years hospitalized in French Geriatric or Infectious wards with confirmed diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) between March 2016 and May 2017. Medical history, and criteria at risk of severity and of recurrence were recorded as listed in the European guidance document. Severe comorbidity was defined with a cumulative illness rating scale comorbidity index (CIRS-CI) C 3. Prognosis was assessed at day-30 after CDI diagnosis. Results: Two hundred and forty-seven patients were included; mean age was 87.2 (SD = 5.4); 62 (25.1%) patients presented with an organ failure and 182 (73.7%) had a CIRS-CI C 3. Metronidazol was the main first intention treatment (51.0%). At day 30, 36 recurrences (14.6%) had occurred and 42 patients (17.0%) had died. Multivariate analysis showed that severe comorbidity Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-8.47, antibiotic therapy in previous 3 months (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.21-4.90), occurrence of organ failure while CDI (HR 2.36, 95% CI 1.16-4.74), were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion: European markers at risk of severity appear adequate in the oldest old. Comorbidities impact the short-term prognosis.

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of physical function on the quality of life of older people. Methods: The study was conducted on 88 women and 11 men, aged [ 60 years, from diverse environments, with functionality of at least one upper limb and the Mini-Mental State Examination test result [ 10. All subjects underwent the measurements of the hand grip strength, the SPPB (Short Physical Performance Battery) test and assessment of health-related quality of life using the SF-36 questionnaire. Results: The mean dominant hand grip strength in the studied group was 1703.4 kG (SD = 436.3). The mean SF-36 results was 38.9 (SD = 12) and 52.6 (SD = 12.7) for the physical and mental domain, respectively. The mean result of the total SPPB test was 7.4 (SD = 3.8). The greater strength of the dominant hand's grip correlated with the higher scores in SF-36 both in the mental (r = 0.204, p = 0.043) and in the physical domain (r = 0.201, p = 0.046). The results of the SF-36 physical domain also correlated with the SPPB score (r = 0.360, p \\ 0.001). Conclusion: Greater hand grip strength, and overall better physical function measured by the SPPB test improve the health related quality of life of people over 60.

There are many different reasons for falls in elderly. Risk factors that may lead to falls should be investigated in the elderly. The purpose of this study to investigate the factors related to fear of falling in community-dwelling elderly. Methods: A sample of 210 elderly (109 females; 101 males; mean age: 71.38 \u00b1 5.84 years) included in the study. Fear of falling was assessed with Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). Physical activity level was measured with Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and mental status with Hodkinson's Abbreviated Mental Test (HAMT). The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and Five-Time-Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSTS) was used to determine subjects' functional mobility. One-Leg Standing Test (OLST), Functional Reach Test (FRT) and Sharpened Romberg test (SR) was used to evaluate balance. Results: As a result of the linear regression analysis, the variables affecting fear of falling at the p \\ 0.05 level were found as HAMT score (Std. b: -0.594), SR (Std. b: -0.382), education year (Std. b: -0.356), hearing aid use (Std. b: 0.355), fall history in the last 12 months (Std. b:0.349), FRT score (Std. b: -0.343) and gender (Std. b: 0.331) in favor of male respectively. Key conclusions: The results of our study showed that fear of fall mostly affected from mental status, balance, education, hearing aid use, previous fall history and gender. We think that multidisciplinary approach is important for effective fall rehabilitation in elderly.Fail to prepare, prepare to frail: predictors of hospital length of stay at admission Department of Nursing, GUH, Galway, Ireland, 2 Department of Stroke and Geriatric Medicine, GUH, Galway, Ireland, 3 Department of Medical Social Work, GUH, Galway, Ireland Introduction: Frailty has a known association with increased length of stay (LOS) in hospital. Specific predictors of LOS have not been measured within a frail older population. Our goal is to determine predictors of LOS to enhance timely discharge from hospital. Method: Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), potential predictors and LOS data were prospectively collected on all patients admitted to a specialist frailty service in an Irish University Teaching Hospital. Both univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to model the impact of predictors on LOS. Results: We analysed 135 consecutive cases, 64% were female, median age was 84 (IQR: 80-88). The majority of patients (93%) were community dwelling. The median Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) at The frail inpatient cohort is a heterogeneous patient group. Ongoing study of this population is required to ascertain predictors of prolonged hospitalisation including caregiver burden. Predictors of LOS should be measured in conjunction with length of ageing in place. Further research of this relationship is required.Elderly abuse: characterization of a population hospitalized in CHUC Antony Soares Dionisio 1 , Manuel Teixeira Marques Ver\u00edssimo 2 , Jo\u00e3o Filipe de Ferreira Gomes 3 Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, Internal Medicine unit, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, Internal Medicine Unit, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, PortugalMistreatment in the elderly people represents an increasingly problem in today's society. This study intends to evaluate the signs of mistreatment in a population of elderly people admitted to a central Hospital in Portugal and relate them with risk factors. The data were obtained through a questionnaire response, with the participation of 100 elderly people admitted to the Internal Medicine A services of CHUC. The questionnaire was divided into 5 sections, allowing the collection of sociodemographic data, information on emotional status through the Yesavage scale, evaluation of the functional state using the Katz index, the prevalence of abuse indicators with the QEEA instrument and data on health status. The analysis of the results concludes that 36% of the elderly have submitted at least one indicator of abuse. Emotional abuse (29%) and negligence (24%) were more frequently detected, followed by financial abuse (12%) and physical abuse (5%). When relating the indicators of mistreatment with the other variables, it was concluded that there is an association between mistreatment indicators and individuals of the female gender, low educational level, depressive symptoms, increased functional dependence, number of medicine taken per day, number of emergency services visits and number of hospitalizations. This study alerts for the high number of elderly people with signals of mistreatment hospitalized in central hospitals in Portugal. It is important to remember of this global health issue and to develop intervention strategies in order to contribute to reduction or extinction of elderly abuse.The role of prognosis for tailored multidimensional interventions in older multimorbid patients: the multidimensional prognostic index Ageing Clinical Research, Dpt.

Here, we report a retrospective analysis of the relationship between CGA-based prognosis evaluation and multidimensional interventions in a German non-geriatric ward of internal medicine. Methods: A structured weekly CGA-based calculation of the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) was performed at admission and discharge in 40 older multimorbid patients (24 M 77.4 \u00b1 4.7 years; 16F 80.3 \u00b1 6.3 years) undergoing a goal-oriented pilot intervention program performed by a team of physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, pharmacists, nurses and geriatricians begun 2016. The MPI predicts mortality after one month and one year in older multimorbid patients with acute disease or chronic conditions. Patients were subdivided in low (MPI-1, score 0-0.33), moderate (MPI-2, score 0.34-0.66) and high (MPI-3, score 0.67-1)-risk of mortality. Results: Seven 5% of the patients belonged to MPI-1, 67.5% to MPI-2 and 25% to MPI-3. Half of the patients were discharged home or nursing homes, one fourth to a geriatric rehabilitation unit. Half of the remaining fourth were discharged to other clinical settings and half died during hospitalisation. For similar MPI values at admission, there is a non-significant trend towards MPI score improvement in patients undergoing multidimensional intervention. The relatively low number and the high heterogeneity of the patient population require further analysis and sample improvement which is ongoing. Conclusions: Multidimensional interventions in non-geriatric medical departments, albeit representing logistic challenges, might be feasible and successful. Further research is needed to clearly identify implementation gaps.Identification of valvular heart disease in older nursing home residents: design of a feasibility studyMaria Cristina Polidori 1 , Anna Maria Meyer 1 , Annika Diedrich 1 , Christina E\u00dffeld 1 , Lisa Ulbrich 2 , Alberto Pilotto 3 , Thomas Benzing 4 , Stefania Maggi 5 , Andrea Ungar 6 , Roman Pfister 2 Ageing Clinical Research, Dpt.

Methods: Hip Fracture (HF) patients consecutively admitted during 2 years in a co-managed orthogeriatric unit at a university hospital were studied. During hospital stay, in addition to the usual orthogeriatric treatment, the FONDA protocol (Function, Osteoporosis, Nutrition, Pain, Anaemia, in its Spanish acronym) for comprehensive hip fracture treatment was applied in all patients. After 3 months, some selected FONDA patients were revised at the Geriatric-FLS (G-FLS) in the outpatient clinic. Treatments in all areas were recorded. Results: Two hundred and twenty three patients were scheduled, and 186 (83.4%) came to the G-FLS clinic. Antiosteoporotic drugs were prescribed in 14% at baseline, 9.5% at discharge and 70% at follow-up. Vitamin D was prescribed in 11% at baseline, 92.4% at discharge and 92% at follow-up.

Individual characteristics such age, gender, body mass, height and dominance can influence MGS. Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is the gold standard image modality for body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) analysis. The aim of this study was to verify the relations between BMD and MGS.Methods: The sample is probabilistic and random, consisting of 100 elderly. The MGS of the right / left hand was evaluated using a hand grip (Jamar, dynamometer). T-score and Z-score DEXA information was directly collect from the equipment (DEXA, Lunar iDXA, General Electrics). Descriptive, correlational and inferential statistical analysis was performed. Results: The sample had homogeneous results for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). T-score revealed that 69.2%, 27.9% and 2.9% had normal, low and loss of BMD, respectively. Around 7% of the participants had results of bone pathology. T-score and Z-score combination indicate that 1.4% of the normal results when are evaluated by T-score are considered bone pathology, 14% of those diagnosed with low BMD have osteopenia and 67% of those diagnosed with very low BMD have osteoporosis. For both hands the higher the bone loss revealed lower MGS. Key conclusions: Z-score is fundamental to make the correct diagnosis, avoiding false negatives of BMD evaluation. The T Score determines fracture risk comparing with healthy individuals, but does not consider the variables gender, age, ethnicity.Socio-economic determinants of anemia in polish elderly population: the results of PolSenior study Arkadiusz Styszy\u0144ski 1 , Ma\u0142gorzata Mossakowska 2 , Jerzy Chudek 3 , Monika Puzianowska-Ku\u017anicka 4 , Alicja Klich-R\u0105czka 5 , Agnieszka Neumann-Podczaska 6 , Aleksandra Szybalska 2 , Katarzyna Wieczorowska-Tobis 1 Laboratory for Geriatric Medicine, Department of Palliative Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Warsaw, Poland, 3 Department of Internal Medicine and Oncologic",

Autonoma University, Madrid, Spain Introduction: Fragility hip fracture (HF) is an event in elderly people associated with high morbidity and mortality. Fracture Liaison Services (FLS) are developing one of the best practices in the follow-up of fracture patients in order to prevent new ones. The aim of this review was to know if geriatric aspects of patients and treatments have been collected in the published descriptions of FLS. Methods: A literature database search was performed electronically via MEDLINE for papers from 2004 until 2018 combining the terms ''fracture liaison service'' with ''hip fracture'' and ''osteoporosis'' including patients aged C 50 years. Results: Twenty three studies were included. Most of them were community studies and very heterogenic in number (including 400 to 151.00 patients). They categorized by type of fracture, type of antiosteoporotic treatment, re-fractures or economic matters. Ten studies included antiosteoporotic treatment. Most of them described a nonspecific bone health treatment before the fracture with a range between 7 to 20% of patients. The main fracture included was HF. Other fractures were wrist or spine. Three studies showed less risk of second fractures, three reported less mortality rates, and four were cost-effective programs. None of them reported the geriatric patients characteristics including functional, cognitive or social factors. Conclusions: In the best of our knowledge none published studies have included samples of HF patients with data about their clinical, functional and mental characteristics, that are very important keys in order to appropriately manage geriatric patients. New studies are needed to solve this lack of data.Functional status of geriatric patients admitted to an internal medicine and cardiology unit in an acute and planned setting Elzbieta Kozak-Szkopek 1 , Judyta Samul 2 , Bartosz Blachucki 3 , Piotr Pruszczyk 2 , Katarzyna Broczek 1 Department of Geriatrics, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, 2 Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, 3 Department of Geriatrics and Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Functional status assessment is a useful component of medical examination of geriatric patients.

Previous studies in TAVI patients used disease-specific instruments, such as the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), which do not measure all-cause limitation of functional status. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, functional status was measured with the Katz BADL (basic activities of daily living) index in 278 surviving patients C 70 years before and one year after TAVI. We used logistic regression models to investigate the association of baseline factors with BADL decline. Results: Complete one-year follow-up data on BADL were available in all surviving patients. One year after TAVI, functional status declined in 28 (10.1%) of the 278 surviving patients. In the subgroup of 32 patients with impaired BADL function at baseline, functional status improved in 17 (53.1%) patients. Statistically significant baseline predictors of BADL deterioration were a Timed Get Up and Go Test (TUG) C 20 s (p = 0.01), and a Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) \\ 26 points (p = 0.01).

Conclusion: Highly supported early discharge home from hospital for patients with delirium is effective and enables patients to regain cognitive function and to continue with good quality of life. It is cost effective to provide time-limited of 24 h care for people who would otherwise have required placement.

This study aims at exploring this potential association in a sample of older people acutely admitted to medical hospital wards. Methods: The ''Italian Delirium Day'' is a multicenter study which is hold yearly in Italy to evaluate the delirium point-prevalence among older patients (C 65 years) admitted to hospital wards and long-term cares facilities. Delirium is assessed on an index day according to 4AT score. Other variables are collected by the attending physician at each center, including demographics, comorbidity, functional status and drugs. CC is measured as the maximum horizontal distance around the left calf as the subject stood upright. Here we report data from the only medical units. Results: Overall, among those who had full data (817), 191 (23.4%) patients had delirium. Delirious patients were older (median 87 vs 83 yrs, p \\ 0.001), more disabled (median NMS 2 vs 6, \\ 0.001) and demented (59.2% vs 10.9%, p \\ 0.001) than counterpart. The median CC was 29 cm in delirious vs 31 cm in non-delirious, \\ 0.001). In a logistic regression model adjusted for covariates, CC was independent predictor of delirium (Odd Ratio (OR) 0.96, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.92-0.99), along with age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06) and dementia(OR 10.49,).

End of Life (EOL) Program in FYKH was established to foster dignified death. In the program, EOL Clinical Plan (EOL-CPi) was used and an 8 beds EOL ward was established. Objectives: To evaluate the outcomes of EOL Program in enhancing dignified deaths. Methods: Retrospective study with all inpatients (age C 65) in EOL Program who passed away in EOL ward between 24 August 2015 to 31 October 2017. Quality of Dying and Death Questionnaire (QODD) was used to assess family member satisfaction of the program. Results: 235 patients with mean age of 87.9 were studied. Their chief diagnoses were advanced dementia (50.2%), active cancers (27.7%), organ failure (13.2%), Stroke (4.7%) and neurodegenerative diseases (2.6%). In the 24 h before deaths, 99.2% of patients were pain free, not agitated and without excessive secretion. After activation of the EOL program, there were significant reductions (all p \\ 0.001) in intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics use, blood product transfusion, use of physical restraints, blood tests, haemoglucostix monitoring and cardiac monitoring. Number of regular medications dropped from 4.8 to 2.6 per patient (p\\0.001). Patients received services from physiotherapists (88.9%), occupational therapists (87.2%), social workers (86.4%) and chaplains (69%). 90.6% family members stayed with patients outside hospital visiting hours and 87.7% could say goodbye to their dying relatives. All patients were not resuscitated when they died. 133 (56.6%) QODD Questionnaire returned rated a total scores of 8.5 \u00b1 1.6 (maximum score 10). Conclusion: EOL Program composing of a clinical plan and a designated EOL ward could be useful to foster dignified deaths and comfort care among dying older patients in hospital.Advance Directives: Brazilian Reality J.

Our objective was to compare the preferences of older versus younger cancer patients regarding surrogate designation and decision making. Methods: Cross-sectional survey of older (C 70 years old) versus younger (\\ 70 years old) cancer patients. First group: older patients with solid cancer aged C 70 addressed for geriatric assessment, included in the ELCAPA cohort between January 2013 and June 2013; second group: adults with cancer, \\ 70 years referred to the oncology unit for anti-cancer treatment decision and management between February 2013 and July 2014. Patient characteristics and information about surrogacy and involvement in decision making were collected. Associations between patient characteristics and preferences were examined. Results: The study included 102 young patients (mean age 55 years) and 130 older patients (mean age 80). Factors independently associated with surrogate knowledge (66%): young age, more children living nearby, high income; factors associated with having already designated a surrogate (62%): young age, decreased number of daily medications; factors associated with designating a surrogate after questionnaire administration (40%): low education, metastasis. Patients requiring an informed consent for any intervention was associated with older age (adjusted OR [aOR] per year = 1.04[95% confidence interval 1.00-1.08]), not living alone (aOR = 2.52 [1.00-6.36]) and having children (aOR = 4.49 [1.13-17.81]). Conclusion: All cancer patients, wanted to be fully informed and 72% wanted to be involved in medical decisions. Preferences for decision control vary between age groups, depending on family members' presence and living alone.Keywords: surrogate, medical information, medical decision-making, patient preference, cancer P-872 Advance care planning: what do patients want?Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK Introduction: Advance care planning is the process by which patients can make decisions about their future healthcare and end of life wishes should they lose capacity. Such decisions are shown to improve quality of life and reduce institutionalization. A review of the literature has been carried out to ascertain the level of decision making patients would like, when conversations should take place and how clinicians should approach the topic. Method: CINAHL, Medline, Embas and Pubmed were searched for journal articles on older patients' views on advance care planning. Key words included ''elderly'' ''advance care planning'' and ''cardiopulmonary resuscitation''. Results: 64 abstracts were screened and 20 full text articles read. 11 articles were included in the final study. Patients will rarely initiate conversations themselves, often presuming that relatives and doctors already know their wishes.

The inter-disciplinary care team at the TC ward, National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology (NCGG), needed electronic communication tool (ECT) for supporting older patients continuously and consistently, with supporting decision-making and sharing the information of process of ACP and medical problems including frailty status. Methods: Organizing-committee for ''Preventing, Avoiding, Postponing or Reducing Frailty Program'' and ''Respecting View of the Patient, Integrated Community Care System Planning Association/ Assembly'' at NCGG, developed ECT to support, record, transfer, and share process of ACP correctly and effectively among different care settings. Results: We had seminars to promote inter-disciplinary TC standing at the view of the patient for frail older people for once in 2014, 3 times in 2015, 21 in 2016, 16 in 2017. A total of 2856 health and long-term care professionals at local communities learned about TC to share process of ACP with frailty evaluation axis.

            "text": "Introduction: In recent years the quality of care and additional interventions applied in nursing homes moves into focus. Using effects as quality indicators we have to struggle with three main difficulties: (1) Cognitive impairment reduces the reliability of information given by residents. (2). The view of the staff may be biased. (3) Residents in nursing homes are very vulnerable and the staff always under stress, so assessment has to be quick, easy and safe. Methods: By means of continuous practice research the Research Group Geriatrics L\u00fcbeck develops a multimodal program (''L\u00fcbeck Model Worlds of Movement'') offered to seniors in need of long-term care. Evaluation of the effects must be based on profound knowledge about the situation in nursing homes. After modification of the target group by elimination of lack of walking ability as exclusion criterion we checked in what way we had to adapt the assessment battery. Results: We found that ceiling effects occurred seldom, floor effects often. For some target parameters we could not find an instrument already established, so we modified existing tests or even developed new ones. In interviews simple language enhances cooperation-not only with the main target group but also with the staff. Key conclusions: Monitoring effects via assessment calls for different instruments according to the functional level of the participants. We share our experiences with typical problems in assessment in nursing homes, show videos of those instruments that are yet unknown to most of the spectators and explain why we chose them. ",

            "text": "Introduction: Cervical spinal fractures are common in the elderly with an incidence of approximately 2 in 10,000 yearly at the level of C2 alone [1] . These can have a devastating impact with some studies quoting mortality rates of 35.1% at 1-year post injury [1] . Method: We examined case notes for patients admitted over the age of sixty with suspected cervical or upper thoracic vertebral fractures over the course of 2017. Results: 12 sets of notes were reviewed for the purposes of this audit. 6 males and 6 females were studied with a mean age of 79.3 (ranging from 60-94 years-old) As well as outcome data based on NICE guidelines, we found practicalities involving discussion with tertiary services to be time consuming and that 33% of our patients had a decline in their previous level of function. This emphasises the devastating impact of these injuries on an elderly cohort of patients, and the length of stay would corroborate this further being almost 3 weeks on average which leads to huge costs for the National Health Service at a time when it is under more pressure than ever. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that even for spinal column injuries with no cord involvement there can be significant input on patient morbidity and functional baseline, with 5 (42%) of our patients declining in their level of function to the point where 2 required 24-h care on discharge from hospital and 3 required intermediate care. This can also impact on National Health Service in general. ",

Currently, equally effective treatments are not available for patients with HFpEF (preserved) and for those with HFmrEF (mid-range), the new category of patients with HF. Methods: Data derived from the ATHENA (AcuTe Heart failurE in advaNced Age) retrospective observational study which included elderly patients (C 65 years) admitted with diagnosis of AHF (worsening or de novo) to the Emergency Department (ED) of a tertiary University teaching-hospital in the period 01.12.2014-01.12.2015 . Inclusion criteria were: mean age of three group of patients was respectively 84. 2, 84.3 and 80.3 years, p \\ 0.001 . Pharmacological treatments at discharge in the three HF groups are shown in the attached table. BBs and MRAs were the only two classes of drugs that had a statistically different prescription rate across the three HF groups: patients with HFmrEF received BBs in similar percentage to patients with HFrEF. Instead MRAs prescription rate in HFmrEF was more similar to the one of patients with HFpEF. Key conclusion: Elderly patients with AHF differ in terms of clinical characteristics and in-hospital prognosis according to the different settings of care. In this population in-hospital mortality seems to be correlated with clinical variables already known to impact prognosis, but also with geriatric variables such as functional status and cognitive impairment and with setting of care of assignment after the Emergency Department, with a protective effect of management in cardiological settings.Aim: Hyperkyphosis commonly affects elderly people and closely related to morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, depression is an important disorder which is also prevalent among geriatric population. The relation between depression and physical illness is apparent and disturbs life quality of patients and their relatives. This study aims to investigate the relation between hyperkyphosis and depression. Methods: The study included 142 participants who applied to our university's geriatric outstanding clinic. The kyphosis grade was measured using the block method. The participants were told to lie in a supine position on a radiology Introduction: The COME-ON study (Collaborative approach to Optimize Medication use for Older people in Nursing homes) aimed to investigate the impact of a complex intervention on the appropriateness of prescribing for Belgian nursing home residents (NHRs) [1] . Methods: A multicenter, cluster-randomized controlled trial was set up. The complex intervention consisted of blended training, local concertation (discussion on the appropriate use of specific medication classes on the nursing home (NH) level) and repeated interdisciplinary case conferences (ICC) (involving the GP, the pharmacist and the nurse) to perform medication review for each NHR. Control NHs delivered usual care. The primary outcome measure was an improvement in appropriateness of prescribing from baseline to end of study, defined as solving at least one potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) or potentially prescribing omission (PPO) from baseline at end of study, and without a new PIM or PPO at end of study. Detection of PIM and PPO occurred via an automatic algorithm based on explicit tools (STOPP/START v2 and BEERS 2015) [2] . Methods: The first draft of the TIME-criteria will be based on combination of STOPP/START version 2 and CRIME-tools. We will ask the panelist consisting of more than 40 experts from geriatrics and various specialties to review the Draft 1 in light of current guidelines, expert opinions, and their practice in terms of importance and accuracy. Then we will ask them to send back with additional recommendations to improve the structure and content of the existing criteria in Phase 1. Draft 2 will be set according to the panelists comments in terms of additional criteria, revision of current criteria and removal of the criteria in Phase 2. The evidence will be sought for the proposed criteria and comments in Draft 2 by the authors and at least 1 relevant panelist for every criterion face-to-face in Phase 3. Then Draft 3 will be set in terms of revisions and removals in Phase 4. Phase 5 and following phases will consist of Delphi rounds. Draft 3 TIME-criteria will be sent panelists by e-mail for assessing clinical relevance. We will ask the panelists to rate how appropriate they found inclusion of each criterion for the final TIMEcriteria by rounds of Delphi. A Likert scale (between 0 and 5)will be used in terms of ''Criteria should be included in the list of TIME-1''for scoring. Median value and 75th percentile value for each criterion will be calculated. Items with both median value of 4-5 and 75th percentile value C 4 will be included in the in the final ''TIMEcriteria-Set''. Conclusion: TIME-criteria will be the first national PIP list in Turkey. We presented the planned methodology of the TIME-criteria on development process. This report may a methodological reference for developing new tools.",

            "text": "Relationship between IL-1beta and cardiovascular disease in elderly patients Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality at elderly age, and are mainly caused by atherosclerosis, a complicated process governed by several risk factors. The basis of atherosclerosis is the chronic vascular inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines secreted by adipose tissue and other tissues play an important role in this process. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1b), a major proinflammatory cytokine, play an integral role in increased migration of inflammatory cells and through proinflammatory, procoagulant nature in developing atherosclerotic plaques.Methods: The aim of this study was to determine changes in serum levels of IL-1b in elderly patients (aged 69 \u00b1 7 years) with cardiovascular disease compared to a control group. Quantitative determination of IL-1b was performed by an ELISA method. Results: Our results showed an increase of IL-1b levels at group of patients with CVD compared with a control group (9.412 \u00b1 16.86 vs 4.672 \u00b1 10.89 pg/ml serum). Key conclusion: In conclusion, serum IL-1b levels are elevated in individuals with CVD, indicating that IL-1b, as a proinflammatory cytokine, plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerotic plaques and in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. Introduction: Four wheeled walkers (FWW) are primary used by geriatric patients for walking but also for other functional activities, such as rising up from a chair. There are evidence in the literature about the biomechanics of chair rising, but the movement strategies of this task using a FWW have not yet been quantified. Aim: To analyze the biomechanical characteristics of rising up from a chair of geriatric patients using four wheeled walker. Methods: Frail geriatric inpatients (C 70 years) will be included in this study and divided into two sub-groups: FWW-Users and Non-FWW-Users. The motion will be captured by ten infrared cameras with 42 reflective markers. Ground reaction forces will be measured with an integrated force plate. Non-FWW-Users rise up with the hands on the thighs. FWW-Users stand up with the hands on the FWW handles. All subjects have to place their feet in a pre-defined position on the force plate and will be instructed to stand up five times. Frailty will be assessed according to the phenotype of Fried. Expected results and clinical relevance: Considering the results of a pilot study with four young healthy women (age \u00b1 27 years), we expect less trunk movement and acceleration, as well as decreased hip and knee joint angles by using a FWW during chair rising. Further, we expect less displacement of the center of pressure by FWW-Users. Our results might improve the recommendations and safety of standing up from a chair using a four wheeled walker.",

Based on studies conducted by some authors using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in patients with cerebral vascular pathology, we describe the response to rivastigmine in 6 patients who present delirium. Methods: We present 6 patients who are between 83 and 91 years, all of them with cardiovascular risk factors (HTA, DM, DL) who are admitted to the geriatric hospital with a recent diagnosis of stroke. All of them presented a hyperactive delirium with bad response to neuroleptics. After performing EKG, a treatment with rivastigmine patches of 4.6 mg per day is started. Results: After 3 and 6 days from the beginning of rivastigmine, the symptoms presented by the patients were re-evaluated. In 4 of the 6 cases, the symptoms were resolved after 3 days and the remaining 2 were resolved in the 4th and 6th days. All cases were resolved after 6 days. Key conclusions: According to the authors, the treatment with rivastigmine could be useful in the delirium of elderly patients who have suffered a stroke as well as to reduce the duration of symptoms. Studies with a larger number of patients are needed to support these results.",

A variety of ways to identify the palliative phase were described: (1) Prognostication, (2) Treatment trade-off and (3) Patients' needs. Within prognostication great variation existed in what was considered a limited life expectancy and was thought to be more difficult in non-cancer patients. When the benefits of treatment no longer outweighed the negatives, this was thought to be a transition point to the palliative phase. However, this was thought to result in late identification. Patients' needs and preferences were also important in identification. Some respondents wait for patients to vocalize preferences themselves, but many actively start these discussions themselves, but found this difficult. Conclusion: Identification seems to be a non-structured process. Difficulties in identification occurred because of variance in definitions, unpredictability of non-oncological diseases, focus on treatment and difficulties in communication. These results contribute to the development of a training for HCPs to timely identify patients in the palliative phase.",

Understanding the complex mechanisms whereby religion may affect depressive symptoms and distress among elderly cancer patients remains an important research priority.

This study aimed to determine validity and reliability of GDS-4 and GDS-5 in Turkish, and to establish a new short-form geriatric depression scale for our population, and also determine the superiority of each short scale to another. Methods: A total of 437 outpatients were enrolled in the study. A researcher evaluated all cases according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, and then another researcher applied GDS-15 to all cases. We obtained the answers of short GDS forms, examined in this study, from GDS-15 forms. After Cohen's kappa analysis, we compared the diagnostic value of each question for geriatric depression according to their kappa values and, developed three (TGDS-3), four (TGDS-4), five (TGDS-5) and, six (TGDS-6) question-scales to screen geriatric depression in the Turkish population.Results: A total of 437 participants were assessed. The mean age (SD) of the patients was 72.95 (7.37 ). Cronbach's alpha values of GDS-4 and GDS-5 were \\0.70. TGDS-3, TGDS-4, TGDS-5, TGDS-6's Cronbach's alpha values were [ 0.70. The best cuf-off values were C 5 for GDS-15, GDS-5, and C 1 for others. Discussion: GDS-15 is the most powerful screening scale for geriatric depression. GDS-4 and GDS-5 are not eligible for depression screening in Turkish older adults. All new short scales are valid and reliable, and the TGDS-4 is a practical, less time-consuming option for daily practice.",

The study in this European project aims to reduce antibiotic (AB) overuse for urinary tract infections (UTI) through implementation of a new algorithm to support clinical decision making.Objectives:1) To design a tailored intervention to reduce inappropriate AB prescribing and usage of AB for UTI by implementing an algorithm that encourages 'watchful waiting' in case of non-specific S&S, combined with a bundle of actions selected on the basis of a conceptual model of factors that influence prescription decisions and with use of a toolbox of interventions to support rational and restrictive prescribing of AB in UTI.2) To conduct and evaluate a RCT of this multifaceted intervention in frail elderly in institutional and community care settings in the four participating countries.Objectives: (1) To design a tailored intervention to reduce inappropriate AB prescribing and usage of AB for UTI by implementing an algorithm that encourages 'watchful waiting' in case of non-specific S&S, combined with a bundle of actions selected on the basis of a conceptual model of factors that influence prescription decisions and with use of a toolbox of interventions to support rational and restrictive prescribing of AB in UTI. (2) Results: In studies aiming in the world-wide of elderly people living in the community, UI prevalence ranging from 8% to 34% have been reported, this ratio reaches up to 70% in the elderly nursing home residents. In the study of Ateskan et al. (2000) , the prevalence of urinary incontinence in the Turkish population was 44.2%. In the study of Leiros et al. (2017) , the prevalence of urinary incontinence in the Spanish population was found to be 15% in women and 11.6% in men.Key conclusions: The incontinence problem should be identified for elderly people living in hospital and at residents or nursing homes. Various evaluation forms can be used for this. The incontinence problems experienced by elderly individuals should be detected; it is thought that the living problems can be reduced and the quality of life can be increased.",

The experience of urinary incontinence is dependent on the incontinence and on the episode of incontinence. Incontinence itself influences social, cultural, and partner relationships. The results show that persons with incontinence use different strategies that are prepared for the next episode of episode of incontinence and searching for possible therapiesto regain control.
