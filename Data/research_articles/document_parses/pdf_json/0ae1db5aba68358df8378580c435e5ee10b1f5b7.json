Timely reperfusion by primary PCI is the standard treatment of STEMI patients. Delaying this time leads to a substantial increase of infarct-related morbidity and mortality. Two reasons were given by STEMI patients: fear of infection at the hospital (5 out of 6 patients) and avoidance of medical care by altruism (1/6). Once there is a similar pandemic in the future, physicians and media should communicate actively towards cardiac patients and general population on the need for urgent care if any unusual symptoms occur.",
