Some viral glycoproteins sort to the specialized apical or basolateral plasma membrane domains of polarized epithelial cells and direct virion budding across those membranes.

To mediate budding of infectious viral particles through intracellular membranes, viral glycoproteins must fulfill two requirements: a signal for sorting to an intracellular compartment and an interaction with the core proteins of the virus. For example, membranespanning domains of the M protein of coronaviruses (Machamer and Rose, 1987; Swift and Machamer, 1991) or the Gl protein of bunyaviruses (Matsuoka et al., 1994) specify glycoprotein accumulation at the Golgi complex.

Similar to certain classic oncoviruses, the foamy viruses utilize a B/D-type virus assembly strategy by which immature viral capsids assemble in the cytoplasm in advance of virion budding (Achong et al., 1971; Hooks and Gibbs, 1975) . As demonstrated by electron microscopy, the characteristic foamy cytopathic effect is due to syncytium formation and a proliferation of swollen, intracytoplasmic membrane-bound structures.

We hypothesized that foamy virus glycoproteins must possess a specific signal for sorting to an intracellular compartment of the secretory pathway. We then searched foamy virus glycoprotein sequences for the presence of known intracellular compartment retention/retrieval motifs. Viral sequences were obtained from the original publications or from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Remarkably, we identified the dilysine ER retrieval signal at the cytoplasmic carboxyl termini of four of the five available foamy virus glycoprotein sequences ( Table 2 ). The bovine syncytial virus (BSV) possessed a lysine in postion -3 and arginines in positions -4, -5, and -6, similar to the rabbit 53 kDa sarcoplasmic reticulum protein (SER 53Kd; see Table 1 ). It is likely that the arginines in positions -4, -5, and -6 of BSV compensate for the lack of lysine in positions -4 or -5, as was suggested for SER 53Kd (Jackson et al., 1990) . The conservation of this wellcharacterized ER localization signal within the glycoproteins of foamy viruses of human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, African green monkey, or bovine origin suggested that it fulfills a critical function in foamy virus biology.

First, following translation, protein folding, and oligomerization, foamy virus glycoproteins follow the secretory pathway out of the ER. Second, in early post-ER compartments, the glycoproteins meet one of two possible fates-budding or retrieval-mediated by their cytoplasmically exposed glycoprotein tails. If the glycoprotein cytoplasmic tails interact with preassembled viral capsids, which may localize to the same intracellular site, coordinated budding of glycoprotein-bearing infectious virus particles into an early post-ER compartment results. If the glycoprotein dilysine signal interacts with the cytoplasmic coatomer complex, retrieval of the glycoprotein from the Golgi to the ER by retrograde vesicular transport results. Viral glycoproteins reaching the Golgi are thereby recycled and may complete a budding interaction on their next transit through the early post-ER compartment. Third, the prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization that is the hallmark of foamy virus infection is a cytopathic effect of this virus on the secretory pathway. Fourth, since tissue cultures infected with foamy viruses form syncytia and since virus budding from the plasma membrane occurs in some cell types (Gelderblom and Frank, 1987) , foamy virus glycoproteins must also escape through the Golgi stacks by the default secretory pathway. This implies either that the interactions of glycoprotein cytoplasmic tails with viral capsids or COPS are saturable or that competitive interactions with other proteins (or viral cytopathic effects) limit the efficiency of budding or retrieval and create the third possible fate for the glycoproteins-escape to the plasma membrane. The post-ER intermediate compartment protein ERGIC-53, which also possesses a dilysine signal, was reported to saturate its pre-Golgi retention machinery when overexpressed, leading to cell surface expression of ERGIC-53 (Kappeler et al., 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1239, "end": 1267, "text": "(Gelderblom and Frank, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1926, "end": 1949, "text": "(Kappeler et al., 1994)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Identification of an ER Retrieval Signal in a Retroviral Glycoprotein"}, {"text": "Teleologically, foamy viruses appear to have evolved a novel assembly strategy to ensure survival.
