In response to this, governments worldwide have implemented a number of measures to curtail the spread of the disease. These include closing sites of public recreation and education, such as schools and universities, and limiting face-toface interactions through enforced 'social distancing'. This will, for the vast majority of the world's population, be an unprecedented experience in which the protection of the most vulnerable depends on strict adherence to the new measures. While many people are adhering to guidelines, some are not. In particular, it is proving a challenge to convince some young people to refrain from physically meeting with friends and taking part in gatherings. For example, this was clearly demonstrated in reports of US students gathering in large groups during their Spring break (https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/americans-who-dont-take-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 to peer influence. These factors mean that adherence to social distancing rules may be especially challenging for young people. Breaking social distancing rules is a risk-taking behaviour: it is a risk to one's own health and the health of others, and may carry legal or financial consequences.",

Policy changes have been made to mitigate the risk associated with young drivers carrying passengers. For example, in the Canadian state of British Columbia, drivers from the age of 17 are restricted to driving with only one passenger, unless they are carrying immediate family members or a full licence holder over the age of 25, for a minimum of two years.",

By breaking the rules, her friends have established a group norm, whereby meeting up is seen as acceptable. Fear of exclusion is also important: she may want to join because she misses her friends, but she may also feel a pressure to do so to reduce the social risk of being rejected. [11] . By the same token, in the current crisis, adolescents may also influence each other in a positive way. As discussed above, peers can also influence adolescents to behave more prosocially, and social norms can be changed [12] .

In this study, social network analysis was used to find highly connected, well-liked students (aged 11-15) who were then selected to develop their own anti-bullying campaigns among peers.

On platforms such as Instagram, they can add social distancing tags (phrases and images) to these posts. These will then be seen by their peers, who may add endorsements, such as comments and Likes, which increase the visibility of the post. As more adolescents see this content, social distancing can be established as a group norm amongst friends. This behaviour will then be modelled by those looking on, who may go on to post similar content themselves. One advantage of this approach is that it is adolescent-led and autonomous: the way in which young people manage social distancing, and their motivation for doing so, will stem naturally from the young people themselves.",
