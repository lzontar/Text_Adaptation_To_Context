By answering the challenges of the era of Digitalisation, facing profound societal changes, benefiting from multiple innovations, information systems and services play an outstanding role in improving and enhancing life of humans and contribute to the progress in Smarter Life. This exploratory approach is based on information, whilst information systems and services contribute to developing new practices, creating new situations, generating new added value. In this perspective, information and knowledge can be viewed as information common good, which is in the heart of service design. It is essential that services are designed in an exploratory way, by involving multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, even multi-national actors, whose active participation would lead to the development of new value-added services. This can be done thanks to a protected place adapted to co-construction of information services, Tiers-Lieu for Services (TLS). To assist the dynamics of the servitised Society and support its governing in a sustainable way, an institutional instrument, called people-public-private-partnerships for services (4PS), is presented.",

A propulsor can be a new law, a political or strategic will, a new technology like a digital system, etc. The propulsions of Society are enabled by propulsors into activities of Society in the form of information services. An information service contains a value proposition [7] .

They are based on the concept of common goods [8] whose basic resource is of natural origin (pastures and forests). In contrast, the basic resource of the information common goods is artificial: data, information or knowledge. For both natural and information common goods, there is a risk of falling into a tragedy of the commons [9] , when unlimited usage (for natural ones) and uncontrolled rush for digital innovations (for information common goods) might lead to their exhaustion. To avoid the tragedy of the commons and make information common goods efficient and resilient, they are organised in an institutional form of informational common. Myriads of services, which are envisaged as information common goods, currently are, have been and will be developing practices, create new situations, lead to new added value. And this added value in services comes from enabling informational commons [10] .",

Traditionally, PPP is intended to facilitate public-private partnerships mainly in the context of infrastructure (hospitals, transport, buildings) and is not particularly focused on services. To enable service creation, our exploratory approach suggests to expand PPP to people-public-private partnerships for services (4PS). 4PS does not only benefit from the advantages of PPP that typically allocates each risk to the party that can best manage and handle it, optimises management responsibility and finds coherence between private interests and the public interest. 4PS specifically targets service design and co-creation, where the key role is given to talented persons who actively collaborate in defining, concretising and developing services.",
