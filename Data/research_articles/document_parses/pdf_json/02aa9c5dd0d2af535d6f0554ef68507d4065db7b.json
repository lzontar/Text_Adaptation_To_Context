Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) releasing an immediate statement that community spread (i.e., infection without relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient) has been present since February, 2020; testing has not expanded significantly to include communally affected patients [4] . Furthermore, many patients who are RT-PCRpositive for COVID-19 remain minimally symptomatic and can transmit the virus without prolonged close contact with other individuals [5] . Together, data suggest that by limiting lab testing to only those with lower respiratory symptoms and a known exposure increases risk to unsuspecting health care workers without personal protective equipment (PPE), results in nosocomial transmission, continued propagation in the community, and potentially delay in care.

Epidemiological data from other countries, such as South Korea, China, and Italy have shown that increased testing, identification of infected individuals, and prompt medical attention can result in markedly lower rates of R 0 , disease propagation, and ultimately disease mortality [11] . With several treatments currently under development and investigation, diagnosis will be of increasing importance. Testing in the USA remains limited, with most centers only testing patients with lower respiratory symptoms and positive exposure history. The cohort presented herein, along with many other published studies, show that this testing strategy may be overly restrictive as there is a significant rate of communal and sub-clinical spread [4, 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] . It is well documented that many patients who are RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 may have an incubation period of 5 days and can transmit the virus without prolonged close contact with other individuals [5, 12] . Here, we show in seven patients without lower respiratory symptoms, documented fever, or known exposure that COVID-19 infection can not only be present, but subsequently result in high rates of intubation and mortality. Many centers do not incorporate imaging in their RT-PCR algorithms and there remains diagnostic uncertainty regarding patients with imaging consistent with COVID-19 but are otherwise of low clinical suspicion. We argue that patients with suspicious imaging findings, especially CT, even in the lowincidence and low clinical suspicion setting shown here, warrants prompt RT-PCR testing.

The lab-confirmed disease incidence at the time of this report remained low, with only 30 lab-confirmed infections and nine in-hospital infections. Despite this, imaging was able to incidentally identify patients with suspected COVID-19 findings, ultimately resulting in seven additional diagnoses and prompt initiation of PPE and quarantine protocols. This suggests that even in the early stages of community spread, there may be a high rate of undetected disease and a much-higher-than-suspected Fig. 2 a A 62- year-old lady presented with subjective fevers, vomiting, and diarrhea.

This is in part due to restrictive testing criteria, which would have excluded these patients without pulmonary symptoms. These patients present a unique risk to those at the point-of-care, as there is low suspicion for COVID-19 at presentation, and therefore, the appropriate PPE precautions are not taken. Had these incidental imaging findings not been identified and correctly reported, or if these patients were not subsequently tested despite the reporting of suspicious imaging findings, these individuals may have continued to spread the infection to healthcare workers and within the community.

Six out of seven (86%) of patients presented with abdominal complaints, consistent with an in-press publication suggesting nearly half of the patients in Hubei province of China endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms and that these patients had a more severe course of illness [16] . Classic pulmonary imaging findings in the absence of respiratory flu-like symptoms may increase the specificity for COVID-19 infection as the incidence of differential considerations (such as other respiratory viruses) is lower in this clinical context. COVID-19 in contrast is known to have an asymptomatic or sub-clinical period with positive chest CT findings [17] . Together, this may explain the high reported specificity of 88% in this small cohort of patients. Elevated inflammatory markers may be an important clinical correlate suggestive of a brewing COVID-19 infection, especially in the setting of leukopenia or a normal white blood cell count. Previous studies have shown that D-Dimer at the time of presentation may predict disease severity, which is concordant in this small cohort, with a markedly elevated D-Dimer range of 1396-3140 ng/mL among four patients, all of whom required eventual intubation and one of which expired during the admission [18] .

Unlike other viral pneumonias which primarily affect the airway resulting in tree-in-bud nonduality in a bronchial distribution, COVID-19 affects the Type II pneumocyte and results in a unique CT appearance that lends increased specificity [21] . Emerging literature has shown that the initially reported rates of sensitivity may have been underestimated, with [9, 10] . In a recent study of over 1000 patients, CT resulted in higher sensitivity in detection of SARS-COV2 as compared with initial RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab samples [22] . Reported positive predictive values were upwards of 60%. Additional studies are emerging that further solidify this positive predictive value, with reports now uncovering a cohort of patients with high-suspicion CT and false-negative initial PCRs later discovered to have positive, concordant COVID-19-positive PCR [23, 24] . It remains to be seen how patients with positive cross-sectional imaging in the setting of high clinical suspicion, especially in the absence of other etiologies (for example, negative respiratory viral panel), should be managed, until higher rates of RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity are confirmed. Chest radiography is not sensitive for the detection of ground-glass opacity and may demonstrate normal findings, especially in the early stages of infection [19] . Bilateral peripheral, multifocal consolidations may be seen. Those in the late stage may present with findings of \"white lung\" and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
