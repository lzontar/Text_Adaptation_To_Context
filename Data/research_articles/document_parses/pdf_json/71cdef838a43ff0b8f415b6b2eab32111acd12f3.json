[1] Over the past decades, several advances of novel technologies and methods have been achieved. [2] There are however everincreasing requirements for improving analytical capabilities, in particular for signal multiplexing [3] and precise quantification. [4] Nowadays, among various optical approaches, the fluorescence-based method has been mostly applied. [5] As it suffers from the drawbacks of spectral overlap and multiwavelength excitation, which fundamentally limit the number of available fluorophores, simultaneous detection of more than ten DNA targets in a single analysis would be hardly performed even using quantum dots. [6] Recently, color-coding microparticle technologies have been developed to solve this problem by making use of an immense number of available encoding beads. [7] One challenge is the accurate and precise quantification because of their polydispersity and nonbicompatibility, as they have micrometer sizes. Furthermore, the complex fabrication process may hamper their broad usability. [8] Therefore, there has been interest to explore a nonoptical labeling and detecting method, which is able to simplify labeling process and provide high-level multiplexing as well as precise determination.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 220, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 315, "end": 318, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 442, "end": 445, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 474, "end": 477, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 577, "end": 580, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 854, "end": 857, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1017, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1244, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "An elemental labeling strategy for bioassays has been regarded as an emerging method in which large biomolecules are labeled with elemental tags and subsequently detected by elemental mass spectrometry, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

[14] Unfortunately, the value of elemental labeling in nucleic acid analysis has not been fully understood, and there are only a few relevant studies in the previous publications. [15] In our opinion, the reason might be that there has been no highly specific and efficient approaches for labeling nucleic acid with elemental tags. Another aspect might be that the current methods of absolute quantification commonly require to couple ICP-MS with time-and labor-intensive separation procedures; for example, chromatography or gel electrophoresis.

[18] In recent studies, there has been no examples of sequence-specific and multiplex DNA analysis in this type of absolute-quantification method. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for the absolute DNA quantification by coupling isotope dilution analysis with DNA hybridization reactions. The principle is shown in Scheme 2. It can be seen that dilution probes (DPs), which were labeled with artificially enriched isotopes, could directly hybridize with the capture probes (CPs) immobilized on the MMPs regardless of DNA targets. In contrast, report probes (RPs), which were labeled with natural REEs, are coupled with CPs through the hybridization of DNA targets. For a constant amount of DPs and excess amount of RPs, the DNA targets determined the ratio of RPs/DPs (R RPs/DPs ) in the hybridized complexes of CPs. R RPs/DPs could be indicated by the ratio of m 2 /m 1 (R m 2 /m 1 ). Therefore, by quantifying the amount of DPs, as well as measuring R m 2 /m 1 in the hybridized CPs, RPs, and DPs, the amount of DNA targets could be calculated according to isotope dilution functions (see the Supporting Information).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 422, "end": 426, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "To demonstrate the feasibility of the HIDA method for multiplex DNA assay, a two-strand system was designed as shown in Figure 3 , where two sequence-specific CPs were used for simultaneous hybridization with BA and SARS targets, respectively.
