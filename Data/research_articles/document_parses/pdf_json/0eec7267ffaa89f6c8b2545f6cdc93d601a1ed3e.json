            "text": "COVID-19 is a deadly pulmonary disease with unique clinical features. A thorough understanding of the molecular and histological correlates of the disease is still missing, especially because postmortem analysis of COVID-19-affected organs has been so far scant and often anecdotical. Here we report the results of the systematic analysis of 41 consecutive post-mortem samples from individuals who died of COVID-19. We found that the disease is characterized by extensive alveolar damage and thrombosis of the lung micro-and macro-vasculature. Thrombi were in different stages of organization, consistent with an ongoing, endogenous thrombotic process. In all the analyzed samples, in situ RNA hybridization showed that pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells had massive presence of viral RNA even at the later stages of the disease. An additional feature of the disease was the presence, in the vast majority of patients, of a large number of dysmorphic pneumocytes, often forming large syncytial elements, a consequence of the fusogenic activity of the viral Spike protein, detected with specific antibodies. Despite occasional presence of virus-positive cells in the heart, no overt signs of viral infection were detected in other organs, which showed common alterations compatible with prolonged hypoxia, multifocal organ disease or previous comorbidities. In summary, COVID-19 is a unique interstitial pneumonia with extensive lung thrombosis, long-term persistence of viral replication in pneumocytes and endothelial cells, along with the presence of infected cellular syncytia in the lung. We propose that several of the COVID-19 disease features are due to the persistence of virus-infected cells in the lungs of the infected individuals for the duration of the disease.

On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization defined the outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 as an international, public health emergency. Clinical features of patients with COVID-19 indicate that infection with SARS-Cov-2 causes severe, and sometimes fatal, interstitial pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV infection, often requiring intensive care and oxygen therapy 2 . Most patients present with fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and typical bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT scans.",

Increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g, IL1B, IL6, IFN\u03b3, IP10, and MCP1) have been documented in the blood of patients with extensive lung damage, suggestive of a cytokine storm condition associated with disease severity 3, 4 . After a first phase of viral replication, this inflammatory response was proposed to rapidly amplify even in the absence of significant viral load, resulting in systemic inflammation and eventually leading to multiple organ failure 5 . Diffuse intravascular coagulation and large-vessel thrombosis have been linked to multisystem organ failure, likely associated to hypoxemia in multiple tissues 6 , The type of lung pathology eventually causing this condition, however, has remained largely unexplained to date.",

Besides indirect multiorgan injury, scattered reports have hinted at the possibility of direct injury caused by viral replication in brain, heart and kidney. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 enters its target cells through the interaction of its Spike (S) envelope protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) enzyme and upon activation by the TMPRSS2 plasma membrane protease 7 . As both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are broadly expressed in various tissues, including brain, heart and kidney 8 and in light of the similarity with SARS-CoV, which also interacts with ACE2 and had been found in both heart and brain of infected patients 9,10 , it was proposed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 could also occur in these organs. A single case of encephalitis caused by SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Beijing, with evidence for the presence of viral RNA by genome sequencing in the cerebrospinal fluid 11 . SARS-CoV-2, similar to other SARS coronaviruses, is detectable in the urine via PCR, indicating that kidney tubules are directly exposed to it 12 . Electron microscope particles with SARS-CoV-2 morphology were shown in the kidney epithelium 13 . However, despite these anecdotical reports, clear documentation of brain, kidney and heart direct damage caused by the virus is largely missing at this moment.",

The average age of patients was 77 for males and 84 for females. Patient data are summarized in Table I .

All IC cases exhibited extremely severe lung damage. At macroscopic examination, lungs appeared congested (representative case in Figure 1a ). In 4 cases, there was macroscopic appearance of thrombosis of large pulmonary vessels, often with multiple thrombi and in one case determining an extensive infarction in the right lobe (Figure 1b panels a and b) . Histological analysis of all cases revealed gross destruction of the normal lung architecture (shown for representative patients in Figure 2a panels a-c), consistent with a condition of diffuse alveolar damage with edema, intra-alveolar fibrin deposition with hyaline membranes and hemorrhage. This was accompanied by massive occlusion of alveolar spaces due to cell delamination (panels df). Loss of cellular integrity was also confirmed by the presence of nuclear dust, indicative of ongoing cellular death (panel g). Numerous calcified areas were detected throughout the lung parenchyma of several patients (panel h). Quite unexpectedly, the inflammatory infiltrate was relatively modest in most cases (representative picture in Figure 2b panel a) , mainly consisting of clusters of CD8+ lymphocytes (at two magnifications in panels b and b') and relatively less abundant infiltration of CD4+ cells (panels c and c'), and the presence of macrophages (panels d and d'). In a few instances, perivascular lymphocytic caps, compatible with ongoing vasculitis, were observed (Figure 2c) . These inflamed vessels were often characterized by endothelial shedding into the vascular lumen (Figure 2d ). Remarkable vascular defects were observed in one IC individual, in whom numerous vessels of medium and small size were abnormal and stenotic due to massive deformation of their structure (Suppl. Figure 1) . These vessels had an edematous wall, in which smooth muscle lost mutual contacts and endothelial cells appeared large, exfoliated and plumped. All three layers were largely inflamed, as revealed by the massive presence of immunoglobulins and HLA-DR-positive leukocytes.",

In several instances, these cells clustered to form areas of squamous metaplasia (shown for three patients in Figure 3c , panels a-c' at two magnifications). Even more notably, the dysmorphic cells very often showed features of syncytia, characterized by several nuclei with an ample cytoplasm surrounded by a single plasma membrane (Figure 3d panels a-b' at two magnifications). These syncytia-forming, dysmorphic cells were bona fide pneumocytes, as they resulted positive for surfactant A and napsin, two pneumocyte-specific markers, and expressed the pneumocyte-specific transcription factor TTF1 in their nucleus (Figure 3e panels a-c respectively).

Besides the lung, however, in our series of post-mortem analyses we could not detect overt sign of possible viral replication in other organs, including brain, liver, heart and kidney. Most of the patients who succumbed to COVID-19 had an advanced age and their organs showed variegate signs of age-related comorbidities, none of which was specifically be reminiscent of viral infection. This does not exclude, however, that infection of a very few cells in these organs would still be a cause for disease.

RNA-positive pneumocytes were present in large numbers in the lungs of 10/10 tested individuals. There has been a suggestion that COVID-19 follows a biphasic course, with an initial phase characterized by viral replication, also detectable by positivity at the qualitative, RT-PCR-based swab test, followed by second phase in which viral replication might become less relevant, characterized by hyperinflammation. While the clinical manifestations of the disease remain different while disease progresses, our data challenge the notion that viral replication has ceased in patients with advanced disease. On the contrary, the presence of abundant cytoplasmic RNA signals in the lungs of the deceased patients after 30-40 days from diagnosis is clearly suggestive of ongoing replication and postulate a role for infection in sustaining both disease phases. Thus, despite swab tests can become negative over time, infection of lung pneumocytes can persist over the entire course of the disease.",

This was evident at macroscopic examination in 5/6 patients from IC Unit and in 31/41 patients in the whole cohort analyzed at the histological level. Fibrin deposition and thrombosis affected both small and large pulmonary vessels and showed clear signs of heterochronicity, with several fresh thrombi neighboring thrombi in advanced stage of fibrotic organization. This is indicative of an endogenous prothrombotic process ongoing in the lungs as opposed as being the lung the target for an embolic dissemination event. In terms of defining the underlying cause for thrombosis, it is tempting to associate the widespread presence of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells with the induction of a prothrombotic state. Consistent with this possibility, we found several endothelial cells lining small and larger vessels infected with the virus, also confirming previous, more anecdotic evidence 18 . Infection of endothelial cells is rendered possible by the known expression of the viral ACE2 receptor in these cells 19 . The presence of lung thrombosis has earlier been associated clinically with COVID-19 disease and recently reported histologically in a smaller group of 7 post-mortem analyses 16 and in another series of patients from Northern Italy (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04. 19.20054262 ).

Different from SARS-CoV, the type I fusogenic protein of SARS-CoV-2 present in the infectious virions becomes activated directly at the level of the plasma membrane by cellular proteases, most notably TMPRSS2 7 . This feature permits envelope-plasma membrane fusion and virion internalization without requiring prior virion endocytosis. As a consequence of this characteristic, the presence of the S protein on the membrane of SARS-CoV-2infected cells determines fusion of these cells with other neighboring cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In vitro expression of the S protein in permissive cells causes the formation of large syncytia, which are highly reminiscent of those observed in vivo, an effect that is largely inapparent with the S protein of SARS-CoV (data not shown).",
