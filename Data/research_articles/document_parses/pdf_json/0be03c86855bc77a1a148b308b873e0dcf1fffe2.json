The incidence of communityacquired childhood pneumonia in low-and middleincome countries in the year 2010, using World Health Organization's definition, was about 0.2 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.1-0.5) episodes per childyear, with 11.5% (IQR 8.0-33.0%) of cases progressing to severe episodes [Rudan et al., 2013] . A variety of viruses and atypical pathogens, including influenza viruses (IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have all been associated with acute respiratory tract infection in children. Human bocavirus (HBoV), belonging to the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, and genus Bocavirus, was first identified from pooled nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens by large-scale molecular virus screening [Allander et al., 2005] .",

Global HBoV activity varies substantially from year-to-year among different populations and regions. Furthermore, epidemiological data shows that HBoV is present year-round with different incidence rates from 2.2% to 19% in children with lower respiratory tract infection [Manning et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006; Allander et al., 2007; Canducci et al., 2008] . Recent studies conducted in several countries have reported that the incidence of HBoV fluctuates based on seasonal attributes with infection being higher during winter months [Allander et al., 2005; Manning et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006] . However, in Japan the infectious rate of HBoV increases during the spring and summer seasons leading to the belief that regional, in addition to seasonal, factors play a role in the rate of disease transmission [Moriyama et al., 2010] . While this suggests that seasonal changes may influence the development of HBoV infection [Naghipour et al., 2007] , meteorological factors (temperature, humidity, and precipitation) may play the greatest role in the epidemics of HBoV based on research conducted in Brazil [do Amaral de Leon et al., 2013] . Although few studies have investigated the epidemiological files of HBoV infection in children with lower respiratory tract infection in subtropical area in China, a possible relationship between meteorological factors and incidence of HBoV is currently unknown.",

Briefly, for hMPV detection, primers were designed to specifically amplify the N gene (213 bps). The forward and reverse primers were 5 0 -AACCGTGTACTAAGT-GATGCACTC-3 0 and 5 0 -CATTGTTTGACCGGCCCCA-TAA-3 0 , respectively. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamers for cDNA synthesis according to the manufacturer's specifications.

In the present study, the median age was 13 months, and the age group of 7-12 months and 13-36 months accounted for 66.3% of the total cases. Furthermore, a higher incidence rate (12.9% and 8.1%, respectively) compared to that of the other age groups was observed. This parallels the findings from studies conducted in Tokyo, Japan and Salvador, Brazil [Moriyama et al., 2010; Nascimento-Carvalho et al., 2012] .",

            "text": "Several previous studies have reported that RSV, hMPV, rhinovirus, and human coronavirus are principal causes of co-infection with HBoV. Presumably, this is because the seasonal distribution of HBoV and these other viruses appear to overlap [Allander et al., 2007; Koseki et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012] . Indeed, the reported prevalence of co-infections with other respiratory viruses varies from 18.3% to 71.1% [Weissbrich et al., 2006; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2007; Brieu et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2011] . Co-infection was also common in this study and accounted for 29.1% (146/502) of the total HBoV positive samples. Interestingly, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was a major pathogen that co-infected with HBoV after RSV and accounted for 25.3% (37/146) of total HBoV co-infection cases. The major presenting clinical picture of lower respiratory tract infection due to HBoV was similar to other common respiratory virus infections like RSV and hMPV including cough, fever, wheezing and tachypnea and no characteristic symptom was found. The present study indicated pneumonia and bronchiolitis were the most frequent diagnoses associated with HBoV infected children, which is consistent with previous study [Allander et al., 2007; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2007; Moriyama et al., 2010] . There was no difference in clinical manifestation, laboratory test and proportion of severe pneumonia between single HBoV infection and co-infection groups. Coinfections were similar to simple infections in children with HBoV except that hypoxia was slightly more frequent (P \u00bc 0.038) in children with co-infection [Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2007] . On the contrary, another study suggested that the association between HBoV and other respiratory viruses may be of clinical importance, and that infection with HBoV alone appears to produce no major symptoms in infants seen in emergency departments [Esposito et al., 2008] . It might have contributed to a lower severity of this present study because of the exclusion of children with underlying diseases. However, a recent study showed that children with single HBoV infection had a higher viral load compared to children with co-infection and there was a direct correlation of high viral load (>10 6 copies/ml) with increasing disease severity in children co-infected with HBoV but not in children with single HBoV infection [Zhao et al., 2013] . Meanwhile, high viral load (>10 4 copies/ ml) of HBoV correlates with the duration of wheezing in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection [Deng et al., 2012] . Nevertheless, a study reported that there was no apparent association between the viral load of HBoV and co-infection or disease severity [Zheng et al., 2010] . Taken together, the role of co-infection with HBoV is still not clear and further studies need to be taken to explore these clinical observations. Interestingly, children with coinfection had a higher rate of lobar pneumonia compared to children with single HBoV infection. It is hypothesized that co-infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae maybe play a role in such phenomenon due to it being the most common cause of lobar pneumonia in children according our 8 year surveillance (data not shown). It has been described in earlier studies that HBoV infection seems to have a seasonal distribution. HBoV positive patients were most prevalent during January to May and the peak occurred during April to May in Japan [Ma et al., 2006] while the seasonal distribution is November to June with peaks occurring during March to April in France [Jacques et al., 2008] . In Hong Kong, the peak seasons were in fall and winter [Chieochansin et al., 2008] . In the Guangzhou area of China with similar subtropical climate, HBoV activity was year-round and the peak season was June [Xu et al., 2012] , similar to what is seen in the present study. In India, however, which has a tropical climate, HBoV appeared to have no seasonal distribution [Bharaj et al., 2010] . These studies suggest that different areas with different climates have their own seasonal distribution of HBoV incidence. However, how a seasonal epidemic of HBoV starts is currently unknown.",

In the present study, HBoV activity was positively associated with mean temperature and relative humidity, which was consistent with another recent report [do Amaral de Leon et al., 2013] . The temperature and relative humidity during the summer was significantly higher than the other three seasons (shown in Fig. 2 ). To our interest, a lag time effect existed between HBoV activity and mean temperature especially for 1 month lag and no lag effect was found between HBoV activity and relative humidity. Taking into account that HBoV causing lower respiratory tract infection possesses an incubation period, several days of medical consultation, and an average of 5-7 days medical treatment before admission to our hospital (data not show), we presume that the lag time between climate parameters and HBoV, as confirmed by real-time PCR, is 2-3 weeks. This is consistent with the results of 1 month lag effect analyzed using linear regression in present study. This explains why the M1 model including mean temperature has a higher R2 value than the M0 or M2 models. Taken together, this study suggests that high temperature plays a more important role than high relative humidity in HBoV seasonal activity. The data on predicting HBoV activity could help in geographical areas where detection of HBoV infection may be difficult.",
