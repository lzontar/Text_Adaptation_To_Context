Initially developed during the Ebola crisis, these actions taken during the first few minutes of a patient encounter have since been used and adapted for new and re-emerging diseases such as measles and MERS. 1, 2, 3 With the recent emergence of COVID-19, the quick and effective identification of patients with highly infectious diseases is of great importance for healthcare facilities today. 4 This study specifically focuses on enhanced patient screening performed for measles. Measles is characterized by rash, fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis. It is especially dangerous for unvaccinated babies and young children. 5 From September 2018 to August 2019, New York City experienced a measles outbreak in which 649 cases were identified. 6 During the peak of this outbreak in April 2019, the New York Department of Health emphasized that hospitals should perform enhanced screening to quickly identify and isolate patients with measles. In order to comply with this request, the Infection Prevention Department within a large health system partnered with several other hospital departments to design and implement a digital measles screening tool.",

No identifying information of the patients was entered into the tool. The tool followed an automated question algorithm that led to one of two outcomes: placing a surgical mask on the patient and immediately informing clinical staff to perform a further risk assessment; or allowing the patient to proceed to their visit.",

These challenges were partly overcome by working together with management to regularly reinforce with front-line staff the benefits of patient screening. Additionally, the remote monitoring capabilities of the digital tool allowed for intervention with staff when large time gaps were noted between survey submissions.",
