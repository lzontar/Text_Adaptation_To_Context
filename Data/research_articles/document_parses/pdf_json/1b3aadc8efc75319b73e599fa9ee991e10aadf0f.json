A clear association of these changes with gestational exposure, per se, could not be demonstrated since it was recognized that a number of interacting factors might be involved.

The ratio of maximal life span and most other measures in miniature swine and rats is 5:1, and this value was used as an initial factor for scaling the critical events in the rat study to the swine (Table 1) . However, because of the disparity in fraction of life span to pubescence in swine and rats, and because of the intent to maximize the length of the exposure period, the ages at initiation of exposure and breeding for the FO animals were changed slightly to those shown on the third line of the table (adjusted).

In brief, the system consisted of a parallel-plate electrode system that produced a uniform (+3.5%), vertical, 60-Hz electric field at 100 kV/m, as measured without cages or animals in the field. Each system consisted of three tiers in the first experiment and four tiers in the second experiment; each tier held three polycarbonate housing modules. The modules were divided into eight individual compartments (12.4 cm wide X 25.1 cm long X 10.2 cm high) in which the rats were housed. During parturition and litter-rearing, however, the rats were housed in modules that were divided into two (experiment 1) and four compartments (experiment 2), so that the cages were four or two times larger than standard cages. The floors of the modules were made of wire-mesh metal and were an integral part of the lower electrode so that the rats were in electrical contact with the reference ground. Since nest-building was found to be a necessary activity for the rats prior to parturition, a small amount of Antron-III@ (a conductive carpeting material) was kept in the cages during the period in which litters were delivered and reared. Food and water were freely available to the rats, and the animals did not receive shocks while eating or drinking. The exposure system does not produce detectable levels of corona, audible noise, or ozone, and vibration of the cages was less than 1.4 pm (60-Hz, peak-to-peak).

Because the values for mortality in the first breeding of the Fo animals were intermediate to those in the second, the more likely interpretation is that the difference is attributable to random variation about a central value.

There is no definitive explanation for differences detected between the exposed and shamexposed groups of rats in the first experiment, or for the absence of these differences in the second experiment.
