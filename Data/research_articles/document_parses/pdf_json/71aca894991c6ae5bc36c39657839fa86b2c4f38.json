A recent report recommended the use of gauze around the patient's mouth as a method for reducing the aerosolization of the virus. 1 Our group performed a series of experiments assessing whether clear plastic drapes were effective in containing aerosolization during extubation. These experiments did not require institutional research ethics approval.",

A pediatric mannequin (Eletripod ET/J10 Tracheal Intubation model, Tuqi, China) was used. Simulated secretions (0.5 mL of Glo-germ) were applied to the oropharynx and the mid-trachea of the mannequin. A cough was simulated using a calibrated medical air gun connected to the distal trachea, fired over 0.4 sec, delivering cough peak expiratory flow rates (CPEFR) of 150-180 L\u00c1min -1 outward from the trachea. The normal CPEFR ranges from 87 L\u00c1min -1 in children under one year to 728 L\u00c1min -1 in some adults; a CPEFR \\175 L\u00c1min -1 is predictive of failure to extubate in adults. [3] [4] [5] Between experiments, the mannequin was cleaned with alcohol, soap, and water. All experiments were video recorded (240 fps) using a combination of GoPro Hero 6 (GoPro Inc, San Mateo, CA, USA), iPhone X, X Max, and XR (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA).",

We then repeated the same extubation cough sequence in a second series of experiments (Exp 2) using a modified three-layer plastic drape configuration. The first layer was placed under the head of the mannequin to protect the operating table and linen. The second torso-drape layer was applied from the neck down and over the chest, preventing contamination of the upper torso. The final over-head top drape was a clear plastic drape with a sticky edge that was secured at the mid-sternum level. It was draped over the patient's head to prevent contamination of the surrounding surfaces, including the HCPs. After the cough was complete, the top two drapes were rolled away together toward the patient's legs to contain and remove the contaminant, and the third drape was removed afterwards.",

A The use of a single clear plastic drape (Exp 1B) restricted the aerosolization and droplet spraying of the particles, but using the three-drape technique (Exp 2) significantly reduced contamination of the immediate area surrounding the patient (Figure B ; eVideo in the ESM). An area of significant contamination, a ''hot-zone'', was noted on the drape covering the bed beneath the mannequin head ( Figure C) . The patient's face and head were also contaminated ( Figure C ). Nevertheless, we were able to successfully remove these drapes (by rolling them up) without further contamination of the area or the HCP. This was evidenced by the lack of fluorescent particles on visual inspection.",

We showed that the use of low-cost barriers (clear plastic drapes) was able to significantly limit aerosolization and droplet spray. Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. Nevertheless, PPE is a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis. The inexpensive and simple method of using clear drapes during extubation (and possibly intubation) of COVID-19 patients may be considered by frontline HCPs and infection control specialists as an additional precaution. Modifications of the clear plastics can be adapted for surgical procedures that may be AGMPs.",

Further studies will be needed to further refine this model and its findings. There is no contamination of the area previously covered by the torso clear plastic drape.",

A) In experiment (Exp) 1A described in the text, coughing during extubation contaminated the airspace around the patient, including the torso, face, head, and bed. B) In Exp 2, a threepanel clear plastic drape was used: first layer placed under the head of the mannequin to protect the operating table and linen; second torsodrape layer applied from the neck down and over the chest, preventing contamination of the upper torso; third over-head top drape with a sticky edge secured at the mid-sternum level. The clear plastic drapes restrict contamination (white fluorescent particles) to the areas between the top clear plastic and the bottom clear plastic drape, as seen in the view from the patient's head under the third drape covering the face. C) Following removal of the top clear plastic drape and torso clear plastic drape in Exp 2, the contamination is restricted to the area previously under the top clear plastic drape.",
