By 11 May 2020, a considerable proportion of the population, approximately 4006257, was detected as Coronavirus cases, and the rate of death Toll, relatively 278892, reported. The rate of mortality and new cases highly progress especially, among the vast spectrum of the population comprised of older people (2) . 2019 n-COV, in the family coronaviridae, are enveloped, single-stranded positive RNA viruses with different diameters from 60 to 140 nm (3) entered into target cells by binding spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (4) . Transmission of this virus is human to human through close contacts or droplets and also feces (5, 6) . Health care workers fundamentally deal with the assortment of clinical characteristics that appeared among different patients. Many people are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. The most common clinical features of symptomatic patients consisting of cough, fever, expectoration, myalgia or fatigue, malaise, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, and rarely hemoptysis and vomiting. And also, in severe cases shows a set of shortness of breath and dyspnea (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Some infected patients would suffer from liver dysfunction. Based on a series of studies working on this issue, the changes in liver enzymes among patients, particularly in severe cases, were revealed (13-17). Given a consequential liver function, and the high risk of death coming from liver disorders, the assessment of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) on liver function is of significant importance among health care workers (17) (18) (19) . Also through a recent study on liver enzyme changes during COVID-19 this fact that higher levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and direct Bilirubin increases the transfer risk to intensive and critical care units, have been stated. It is reported that the AST level of 30.5 (U/L) had a sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 68.5% for critical and intensive care transfer (20). Moreover, In a similar study with us, elevated Serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase, Alanin aminotransferase (ALT), total Bilirubin, and lower levels of Albumin were observed in severe cases (21) .",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus 2019, which named SARS-Cov-2, shares about 80% of the genetic sequence with SARS-CoV, which they also have the same cell entry receptor (23) . Based on studies was performed by Zhao et al., it is demonstrated that 83% of ACE2-expressing cells were alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII), suggesting that these cells can serve as a reservoir for viral invasion (24). Extrapulmonary sites such as the heart (25), kidney (26), endothelium (27), intestine (28), and liver (29) also expressed the ACE2 receptor. During recent studies, it is revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the cholangiocyte ACE2 receptors leading to cholangiocyte dysfunction and, through the induction of a systematic inflammatory response, causes liver injury (30). Also, Through liver biopsy assessing of the deceased case of COVID-19, moderate microvesicular steatosis, a common finding in sepsis (31), and mild lobular and portal activity were observed, which confirming that this injury could occur; as a result SARS-CoV-2 infection (32). In another theory, it is postulated that viral-induced cytotoxic T cells and imbalanced innate immune system lead to collateral liver damage, indicating the association between abnormal liver markers and COVID-19 disease severity (33, 34). Recent studies on SARS clinical features have revealed that the liver enzyme abnormalities are common but not as the prominent feature of this illness (35). Through the recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, liver dysfunction in many varieties has been reported in many cases. In this systematic review and meta-analyses, we aimed to evaluate the prognoses of liver damage. Liver test abnormality at the admission time can be used as a predictor for the severity of the disease (36). In this case, it is assumed that enhanced end-expiratory pressure by increasing right atrial pressure lead to hepatic congestion and blocked venous return. So many patients admitted to the hospital are with liver abnormalities in the absence of mechanical ventilation (33). Acute liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 is more common in patients with poor prognosis who had significantly higher risks of developing severe pneumonia, and Male elderly COVID-19 patients with diabetes and lymphopenia. In the early stages, it could enhance the mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. Also, it is reported that hepatic functional indexes of two-third COVID-19 patients remain poor in two weeks after discharge as the consequence of Compassionate drug usage during hospitalization due to lacking specific drug for SARS-CoV-2 (37, 38). In the current study, trough analyses, results showed significantly higher liver toxicity in sever patients than non-sever patients. The liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity) is a common adverse event that could occur during clinical practice because of the leading systemic toxicity of drugs and chemicals (39). Many drugs used for COVID-19 patients also could damage the liver and among them lopinavir/ritonavir associated with seven times higher odds of liver injury, which have been reported to cause liver damage and affect liver tests (36, 40). Other drugs that have been used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, such as antibiotics, antivirals, and steroids, could potentially damage the liver, but still not being evident (41). However, for hospitalized patients, more attention should be paid to drug-induced liver damage. All to gather Liver enzymes elevation could be due to drugs used for treatment, sepsis, and shock (36). In this systematic and meta-analyses review, we observed a higher amount of ALT, AST, LDH, D-Dimer, CRP, and total Bilirubin (TBIL) with slightly lower albumin in sever group compared to non-sever groups. Based on previous studies on the ACE2 receptor, it is reported that slight amounts of these receptors were expressed in human hepatocyte (27, 42), indicating the non-significant influence of liver function by SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-sever and mild cases (43, 44). Recent studies have reported the incidence of liver damage in severe cases of COVID-19 with mostly higher ALT, AST, LDH, CRP, D-dimer, and total bilirubin amount and lower albumin (36, 37, 43-45). Also, it has been mentioned that D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and AST higher levels were associated with COVID-19 severity (44). Moreover, through a study on deceased cases of COVID-19 with liver abnormalities, it is reported that in patients with severe complications, ALT, AST, and TBIL were higher than the standard limit. Furthermore, total albumin was also reported lower than the limited upper unit (46). In addition, in other studies, lower albumin levels in severe cases also have been reported (44, 47). Hypoalbuminemia could occur as a result of inadequate nutrition intake and overconsumption during hospitalization (43). Based on the result of this study, patients who have the severe condition are 5.54, 4.22, 4.96, 4.13 and 4.34 times more likely to have elevated CRP, ALT, AST, LDH, D-dimer enzymes retrospectively. However, the chance of developing liver toxicity as a complication of COVID-19 was 1.76 times more in severe patients. Also, in a similar study, elevated serum levels of AST, ALT, and total Bilirubin, and lower levels of Albumin were observed in severe cases.",

            "text": "Some studies also reported that LDH was higher in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. LDH is an essential element in glucose metabolism and expressed widely through organ body tissues, especially in myocardial and liver cells. LDH would release within cells upon the cytoplasmic membrane damage (34). Based on previous studies on SARS and MERS, the elevated levels of LDH also were reported. So it can be concluded that LDH independently could act as a risk factor with poor clinical outcomes and raised the alarm for further analyses (45, 49). The higher levels of LDH maybe is due to the broad expression of ACE2 receptors in cardiac blood vessels (27, 50). In another theory, the increased amount of LDH was attributed to myositis, which resulted from virus infection (33). Moreover, its amounts would be increased as a cause of hepatocyte injuries because of the coexisting of ACE2 receptors in hepatocytes. So it's lightening this fact that liver and cardiac damage could occur as a direct effect of SARS-Cov-2 on targeted organ damage (34). Thus elevated LDH enzyme in sever cases might occur as a consequence of directed hepatic or extrahepatic damage. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 could affect lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes (34). Patients with damaged T cells are more vulnerable to infections and their risk increase in patients with severe illness. The CRP in sever patients had higher levels than non-sever, and the CRP level above 100mg/dl could be an alarm for bacterial infection. So higher CRP might indicate the risk of other infections (mostly opportunistic infections), which could affect the liver or lead to hepatitis, and act as a prognostic factor (51-54). On the other hand, cytokine factors that were marked by higher concentrations of CRP, ESR, ferritin, and hs-CRP are associated with the severity of COVID-19. As a result, higher amounts of cytokine factors in blood serum might suggest a pro-inflammatory factor storm (55). Another severe complication that occurred in COVID-19 patients is sepsis, and it could be with some clinical and labratorical manifestations. Through labratorical analyses, hyperbilirubinemia, acidosis, high lactate, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia were mostly seen in COVID-19 patients in ICU (56, 57). Also, as mentioned above, sepsis is one of the liver injury causes during infection with SARS-Cov-2. Trough abnormal laboratory findings in severely affected patients, aberrant coagulation has been reported (58).

Besides, The elevation in D-dimer levels could occur as a result of cirrhosis and also are increased gradually as the degree of liver dysfunction increases in severity (62, 63) . All to gather higher levels of D-dimer with hepatic or extrahepatic origin could be act as a prognostic factor for COVID-19.
