However, for the development of a durable RNAi-based gene therapy against HIV-1, multiple shRNAs need to be expressed simultaneously in order to avoid viral escape. In this study, we tested a multiple shRNA expression strategy for different shRNAs using repeated promoters in a lentiviral vector. Although highly effective in co-transfection experiments, a markedly reduced activity of each expressed shRNA was observed in transduced cells. We found that this reduced activity was due to recombination of the expression cassette repeat sequences during the transduction of the lentiviral vector, which resulted in deletions of one or multiple cassettes. To avoid recombination, we tested different promoters for multiple shRNA expression. We compared the activity of the human polymerase III promoters U6, H1, and 7SK and the polymerase II U1 promoter. Activities of these promoters were similar, irrespective of which shRNA was expressed. We showed that these four expression cassettes can be combined in a single lentiviral vector without causing recombination.

An elegant way to achieve this objective is to use a gene therapy approach in which the antiviral siRNA is stably expressed in the cell as a short hairpin RNA (shRNA). 4 Stable expression of anti-HIV shRNAs in T cells results in potent inhibition of HIV-1 replication. 5, 6 However, the application of a single shRNA inhibitor is not sufficient to maintain inhibition. After extended culturing, resistant virus can emerge containing point mutations or deletions within the siRNA target site. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Thus, in order to achieve durable inhibition, multiple antiviral siRNAs should be expressed simultaneously, 9, 12, 13 a strategy similar to current drug combination therapy of HIV-1-infected individuals. 14, 15 Strategies to express multiple siRNAs 16 include extended shRNAs, 17 long double-stranded RNA expression, 18 and multiple shRNA expression, 9, 19 of which the latter is currently most promising. The lentiviral vector system is highly effective for delivery of shRNA expression cassettes. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] An apparently straightforward method to express multiple shRNAs from a lentiviral vector is to incorporate multiple expression cassettes that use the same promoter. 6, 9, 19, 25, 26 However, such an approach may be problematic due to intrinsic properties of the lentiviral vector. Retroviruses are naturally recombination prone, as the reverse transcriptase is a polymerase with poor processivity. During the transduction process, in which reverse transcriptase converts the RNA genome into DNA, reverse transcriptase can slip on repeats in the RNA template, resulting in a sequence duplication or deletion.

For the double-cassette deletion mutants, both AB (3 ) and BC (4 ) deletions were observed. No proviruses were observed in which A and C are deleted, probably because it requires a double recombination event. Deletion of all three cassettes is not possible by repeat-induced recombination, and is indeed not observed. Deletion of C requires recombination at the H1 promoter, deletion of A is possible only through recombination at the terminator sequence. In total, deletion of A (4 ) is seen less frequently than deletion of C (6 ), which indicates that recombination at the H1 promoter is more likely, as would be expected since it represents the largest repeat sequence. Deletion of B occurs most often, in 16 of the 22 clones analyzed. We also observed deletions in cell clones transduced with the shRNA2 lentiviral vector (data not shown). Since deletion of each expression cassette was frequently observed in the cell clones, these results explain why the magnitude of inhibition was reduced for all shRNAs in cells transduced with shRNA2 and shRNA3.

Cell populations that express only a single shRNA will provide a niche in which resistant viruses will be selected, ultimately leading to full resistance to all shRNAs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 344, "end": 346, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 347, "end": 349, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 350, "end": 353, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 354, "end": 357, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 358, "end": 360, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In order to prevent recombination we selected four different promoters that lack sequence similarity for our multiple shRNA expression strategy.

Analysis of transduced cell clones indicated that this vector does not recombine. The shRNA4 vector titer was reduced due to an increase in vector genome size, but we note that the PGK promoter and GFP gene (1,255 nt) will eventually be removed from the clinical vector, thus avoiding this production problem. We next tested the effect on HIV-1 replication in a gene therapy setting. In a transduced cell line expressing only a single shRNA, HIV-1 could escape by mutating the target sequence. By contrast, HIV-1 did not escape in the shRNA4-transduced cell line. However, viral spread was observed in two of the six infected shRNA4 cell cultures, though these viruses are not true escape mutants, since they did not have a resistant phenotype upon viral passage to fresh cells. Furthermore, no genotypic changes were observed in the four target sequences. This result indicates that virus replication is not completely blocked by the combined expression of four shRNAs. This should not come as a surprise since RNAi does not target the incoming genome 42, 43 and RNAi does not silence gene expression completely. Thus, virus replication may still occur, albeit at a very low level, perhaps slowly accumulating until a certain threshold is reached at which CA-p24 production can be measured. Most importantly, we did not witness viral escape, which shows that the imposed genetic barrier is too high for the virus to overcome inhibition by four shRNAs. 1, 12, 13 It is difficult to assess the implications of our results for gene therapy in which T cells or blood stem cells of HIV-1-infected patients are treated ex vivo. With only a single lentiviral vector copy per cell, we obtained durable inhibition for up to 40 days with the shRNA4 vector. In addition, we also observed that primary CD4 + T cells transduced with the shRNA4 lentivirus are viable and have normal growth rates and we have shown that wild-type HIV-1 or a Pol-47-resistant virus is potently inhibited in these cells. The next step in the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of the shRNA4 vector is testing in a relevant in vivo system. Recently, a mouse model with a humanized immune system was developed that we propose to use for this purpose. 22, 44 We will study the safety of the shRNA4 vector by analyzing the development of the immune system from transduced human CD34 + precursor cells. In addition, we can also infect these mice with HIV-1 to evaluate the in vivo efficacy and durability of the multiple shRNA approach. 45, 46 Gene therapy to protect cells against HIV-1 holds great promise in the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals. 47, 48 Recently, the first phase I clinical trial involving lentiviral vectors was shown to be safe. 49 In this clinical trial, HIV-1 patients were treated with a conditionally replicating viral vector encoding an antisense sequence directed against the HIV-1 genome. This year, a clinical trial is expected to start which combines different anti-HIV RNAs in a single lentiviral vector. 25 The promising results presented here strongly support the development of our multiple shRNA strategy against HIV-1 that, when shown to be safe and effective in vivo, may be next in line for clinical testing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1112, "end": 1115, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1118, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1514, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1518, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1521, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2280, "end": 2283, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2286, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2563, "end": 2566, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2567, "end": 2569, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2685, "text": "47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2688, "text": "48", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2783, "end": 2785, "text": "49", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3069, "end": 3071, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Plasmid construction.

(d) Cell-free virus (marked with a star in c) was used to infect a control cell line (JS1), shRNA1 cell lines (Gag-5, Pol-1, Pol-47, and R/T-5) and the shRNA4 cell line. The virus could replicate exclusively in the control cell line, indicating that the virus emerging in c is not resistant.
