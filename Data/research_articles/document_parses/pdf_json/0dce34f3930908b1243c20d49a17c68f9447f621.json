            "text": "It is reported that the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can be transmitted via droplets and contact to infected surfaces [1] . Healthcare workers who undertake the follow-up and treatment of these infected patients use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs; type of FFRs used in this study is FFP2 respirators and it is approximately equivalent of N95 respirators) and surgical masks, which are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), to prevent contamination [2] . These FFP-2 respirators must therefore be close fitting to prevent air leakage. However, the risk of carbon dioxide retention due to re-breathing in healthcare workers who use a FFP-2 respirators for a long time with minimal air leakage is not clear [3] . In our study, it was aimed to evaluate changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2 ) and ventilation parameters in healthcare workers while wearing PPE in COVID-19 outbreak.",

Data of the participants regarding age (30.0\u00b12.87), body mass index (BMI, mean value 24.3 kg/m 2 ) and smoking status (n=6) were recorded. Participants were monitored via Capnostream\u2122 20 bedside monitor (Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) which can measure nasal EtCO 2 , fractional inspired carbon dioxide (FiCO 2 ), respiratory rate (RR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and heart rate (HR).",

However, in a published case, a healthy intensivist who wore FFP-2 respirator to perform a percutaneous tracheostomy in a patient with multidrug resistant tuberculosis and showed symptoms of dyspnea, tachycardia and tremor at 30th minutes of procedure [4] . Meanwhile, the intensivist's EtCO 2 level measured at EtCO2: end tidal carbon dioxide pressure, FiCO2: fractional inspired carbon dioxide. There are several limitations in the current report. First, the depth of breathing and tidal volume was not measured to avoid air leakage. Second, the effects of FFP-2 respirators on airway resistance and flow have not been evaluated. Likewise, the differences in exercise and rest were not compared.",
