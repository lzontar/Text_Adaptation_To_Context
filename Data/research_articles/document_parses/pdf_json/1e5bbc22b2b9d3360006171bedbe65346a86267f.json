The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic on 30 th January 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern. In India, the first case of novel coronavirus was detected on 30 th January in the State of Kerala (Ward, A. (2020, March 24) ). As the number of confirmed novel coronavirus positive cases closed 500, the Govt. of India introduced \"Janta Curfew\" on 19 th March 2020 and after that Govt. of India enforced 21 days lockdown Phase-I nationwide from 25 th March -14 th April, nearly all services and factories were suspended (Singh, K. D., Goel, V., Kumar, H., Gettleman, J. (2020, March 25) ). Due to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased, on 14 th April 2020, Govt. of India extended the lockdown Phase-I period till 3 rd May 2020 i.e. lockdown Phase-II, with certain relaxations (Bhaskar, U.

The main objective of clustering is to group these data elements into homogeneous sub-groups such that the intra-cluster similarities are high while inter-cluster similarities are low. The data elements in each sub-group are called a cluster, and the union of all sub-groups is equal to the dataset D. Clustering methods have been classified into five different categories, i.e., Partition-based, density-based, hierarchical-based, grid-based and model-Based (Han, Jiawei, Jian Pei, and Micheline Kamber (2011) ). In the last few decades, clustering algorithms have been extensively used to solve the problem of data-mining. In this research, we have used incrementalKMN (Prasad, R. K., Sarmah, R., Chakraborty, S.,(2019) ) clustering method on novel coronavirus (COVID-19) data set of India based on confirmed cases, which produced the k desired number of group of states of India i.e. divide the data set into k number of group of states. And apply the growth rate and doubling time from equation 2. 1 and equation 2. 2 on desired k number of clusters produced by incrementalKMN (Prasad, R. K., Sarmah, R., Chakraborty, S.,(2019)) clustering method. The steps of incrementalKMN method is given below:",

In our study, we have considered the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) data set till 20 th June 2020. The state MH was in the high-risk state based on the number of confirmed cases and {DL, TN} was in moderate-high risk state which shows in figure 7 . Similarly, the state GJ was in moderate risk state, and {MP, RJ, UP, WB} were in moderate-low risk state, and the rest of the states and UTs were in the low-risk state. From Table 6 , the growth rate of all clusters has decreased or remained the same in lockdown phase-V as compared to previous phases. Similarly, the doubling time of all clusters has increased or remained the same. The doubling time of cluster I i.e. the state MH is in 24 days(approximate). Similarly, cluster II i.e. the states {DL, TN} is required 14-15 days(approximate) to double and cluster III i.e. the state GJ is required 35 days to double. The cluster IV and V have 24 days(approximate) and 9 days(approximate) to doubling time. From what we have found it was expected that some of the states/Uts lying in the Category V will soon move to the Category IV in the next weak or so starting 21 th June 2020. In order to verify this, we have then extended our study covering data up to 30 th June 2020 to cover the full Unlock I period to see how the cluster changed in the last 10 days of this phase. The result is shown in figure 9 . As expected the some of the states {AP, AS, BR, HR, JK, KA, OR, PB, TG} which were in Category V moved to category IV. In fact from figure 8 where we have demarcated 6 instead of 5 clusters to reveal hidden groups with the cluster V gave a clear indication of the tendency of the above state towards the next higher risk category (see also Table 7 ). ii. Lockdown seemingly had its impact on two other states HR(Haryana) and UP(Uttar Pradesh) as these states improved down to low risk and moderate low-risk category.",

Then evaluated the growth rate and doubling time of confirmed cases of each cluster. As on 30 th June 2020, the state MH (Maharastra) in on high-risk category with the doubling time of confirmed cases is 23-24 days(approximate). Similarly, the union territory of DL (Delhi) and the state TN (Tamil Nadu) are in moderate-high risk state and is expected to join MH in the high-risk state soon as the doubling time of these set of states is 14-15 days(approximate). The state GJ(Gujarat) is in moderate risk sate and has decreased their growth rate during the lockdown phases and the doubling time of this state is 35 days(approximate). Moreover, the states MP (Madhya Pradesh), RJ (Rajasthan), UP (Uttar Pradesh), and WB (West Bengal) are in moderate-low risk state and the growth rate and doubling time are same as the state of MH. Rest of the states are in the low-risk cluster but some of the states namely AP (Andhra Pradesh), AS (Assam), BR (Bihar), HR (Haryana), JK (Jammu and Kashmir), KA (Karnataka), OR (Odisha), PB (Punjab), and the TG (Telangana) are expected to reach next level of risk soon. Our aim in this work is not to prove or disprove anything but present the pattern for everyone to see and realize that the situation we are in still remains critical. There is no room to rejoice now by saying we are in low risk compared to MH. Yes! MH is ahead of us but not in terms of numbers but we are behind them in time scale and it is a matter of time before we reach and experience that stage. ",
