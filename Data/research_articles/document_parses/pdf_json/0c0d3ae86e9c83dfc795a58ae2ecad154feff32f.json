Sometimes data may be obtained after the fact from reports of epidemics or of endemic disease levels, but the data may be incomplete or inaccurate. In addition, data may contain enough irregularities to raise serious questions of interpretation, such as whether there is evidence of chaotic behaviour [12] .

In fact, models often identify behaviours that are unclear in experimental data -often because data are non-reproducible and the number of data points is limited and subject to errors in measurement. For example, one of the fundamental results in mathematical epidemiology is that most mathematical epidemic models, including those that include a high degree of heterogeneity, usually exhibit \"threshold\" behaviour. In epidemiological terms this can be stated as follows: If the average number of secondary infections caused by an average infective, called the basic reproduction number, is less than one a disease will die out, while if it exceeds one there will be an epidemic. This broad principle, consistent with observations and quantified via epidemiological models, has been consistently used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination policies and the likelihood that a disease may be eliminated or eradicated. Hence, even if it is not possible to verify hypotheses accurately, agreement with hypotheses of a qualitative nature is often valuable. Expressions for the basic reproduction number for HIV in various populations have been used to test the possible effectiveness of vaccines that may provide temporary protection by reducing either HIV-infectiousness or susceptibility to HIV. Models are used to estimate how widespread a vaccination plan must be to prevent or reduce the spread of HIV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In the mathematical modeling of disease transmission, as in most other areas of mathematical modeling, there is always a trade-off between simple models, which omit most details and are designed only to highlight general qualitative behaviour, and detailed models, usually designed for specific situations including short-term quantitative predictions.

In these notes we describe simple models in order to establish broad principles. Furthermore, these simple models have additional value as they are the building blocks of models that include more detailed structure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Many of the early developments in the mathematical modeling of communicable diseases are due to public health physicians. The first known result in mathematical epidemiology is a defense of the practice of inoculation against smallpox in 1760 by Daniel Bernoulli, a member of a famous family of mathematicians (eight spread over three generations) who had been trained as a physician. The first contributions to modern mathematical epidemiology are due to P.D. En'ko between 1873 and 1894 [11] , and the foundations of the entire approach to epidemiology based on compartmental models were laid by public health physicians such as Sir Ross, R.A., W.H. Hamer, A.G. McKendrick and W.O. Kermack between 1900 and 1935 , along with important contributions from a statistical perspective by J. Brownlee. A particularly instructive example is the work of Ross on malaria. Dr. Ross was awarded the second Nobel Prize in Medicine for his demonstration of the dynamics of the transmission of malaria between mosquitoes and humans. Although his work received immediate acceptance in the medical community, his conclusion that malaria could be controlled by controlling mosquitoes was dismissed on the grounds that it would be impossible to rid a region of mosquitoes completely and that in any case mosquitoes would soon reinvade the region. After Ross formulated a mathematical model that predicted that malaria outbreaks could be avoided if the mosquito population could be reduced below a critical threshold level, field trials supported his conclusions and led to sometimes brilliant successes in malaria control. However, the Garki project provides a dramatic counterexample. This project worked to eradicate malaria from a region temporarily. However, people who have recovered from an attack of malaria have a temporary immunity against reinfection. Thus elimination of malaria from a region leaves the inhabitants of this region without immunity when the campaign ends, and the result can be a serious outbreak of malaria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 493, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 684, "end": 708, "text": "Kermack between 1900 and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 709, "end": 713, "text": "1935", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We will begin with an introduction to epidemic models.

The fall of empires has been attributed directly or indirectly to epidemic diseases. In the second century AD the so-called Antonine plagues (possibly measles and smallpox) invaded the Roman Empire, causing drastic population reductions and economic hardships. These led to disintegration of the empire because of disorganization, which facilitated invasions of barbarians. The Han empire in China collapsed in the third century AD after a very similar sequence of events. The defeat of a population of millions of Aztecs by Cortez and his 600 followers can be explained in part by a smallpox epidemic that devastated the Aztecs but had almost no effect on the invading Spaniards thanks to their built-in immunities. The Aztecs were not only weakened by disease but also confounded by what they interpreted as a divine force favoring the invaders. Smallpox then spread southward to the Incas in Peru and was an important factor in the success of Pizarro's invasion a few years later. Smallpox was followed by other diseases such as measles and diphtheria imported from Europe to North America. In some regions, the indigenous populations were reduced to one tenth of their previous levels by these diseases.

There were many factors involved in this increase, including changes in marriage age and technological improvements leading to increased food supplies, but these factors are not sufficient to explain the increase. Demographic studies indicate that a satisfactory explanation requires recognition of a decrease in the mortality caused by periodic epidemic infections.

Values of susceptibles and infectives in Eyam are given in [31] for various dates, beginning with S(0) = 254, I(0) = 7, shown in Table 2 .1. The relation ( The actual data for the Eyam epidemic are remarkably close to the predictions of this very simple model. However, the model is really too good to be true. Our model assumes that infection is transmitted directly between people. While this is possible, bubonic plague is transmitted mainly by rat fleas. When an infected rat is bitten by a flea, the flea becomes extremely hungry and bites the host rat repeatedly, spreading the infection in the rat. When the host rat dies its fleas move on to other rats, spreading the disease further. As the number of available rats decreases the fleas move to human hosts, and this is how plague starts in a human population (although the second phase of the epidemic may have been the pneumonic form of bubonic plague, which can be spread from person to person). One of the main reasons for the spread of plague from Asia into Europe was the passage of many trading ships; in medieval times ships were invariably infested with rats. An accurate model of plague transmission would have to include flea and rat populations, as well as movement in space. Such a model would be extremely complicated and its predictions might well not be any closer to observations than our simple unrealistic model. In [31] a stochastic model was also used to fit the data, but the fit was rather poorer than the fit for the simple deterministic model (2.1). In the village of Eyam the rector persuaded the entire community to quarantine itself to prevent the spread of disease to other communities. This policy actually increased the infection rate in the village by keeping fleas, rats, and people in close contact with one another, and the mortality rate from bubonic plague was much higher in Eyam than in London. Further, the quarantine could do nothing to prevent the travel of rats and thus did little to prevent the spread of disease to other communities. One message this suggests to mathematical modelers is that control strategies based on false models may be harmful, and it is essential to distinguish between assumptions that simplify but do not alter the predicted effects substantially, and wrong assumptions which make an important difference.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 469, "end": 473, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2210, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 942, "end": 949, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Example.

Disease death rates dropped sharply in the eighteenth century, partly from better understanding of the links between illness and sanitation and partly because the recurring invasions of bubonic plague subsided, perhaps due to reduced susceptibility.

The 1932 and 1933 models ofKermack and   McKendrick, which incorporated births and deaths, did not include this dependence. While age of infection models have not played a large role in studies of epidemics, they are very important in studies of HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS acts on a very long time scale and it is essential to include demographic effects (recruitment into and departure from a population of sexually active individuals). Also, the infectivity of HIV-positive people is high for a relatively short time after becoming infected, then very low for a long period, possibly several years, and then high shortly before developing into full-blown AIDS. Thus, the age of infection models described by Kermack and McKendrick for epidemics but not for endemic situations, have become important in endemic situations.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
