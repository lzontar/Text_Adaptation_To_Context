Some literature confirms the association of temperature with disease transmission while some oppose the same. This work intends to determine whether there is a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases. Three different causal models were used to capture stochastic, chaotic and symbolic natured time-series data and to provide a robust & unbiased analysis by constructing networks of causal relationships between the variables. Granger-Causality method, Transfer Entropy method & Convergent Cross-Mapping (CCM) was done on data from regions with different temperatures and cases greater than 50,000 as of 13 th May 2020. From the Granger-Causality test we found that in only Canada, the United Kingdom, temperature and daily new infections are causally linked. The same results were obtained from Convergent Cross Mapping for India. Again using Granger-Causality test, we found that in Russia only, relative humidity is causally linked to daily new cases. Thus, a Generalized Additive Model with a smoothing spline function was fitted for these countries to understand the directionality. Using the combined results of the said models, we were able to conclude that there is no evidence of a causal association between temperature, humidity and Covid-19 cases.",

            "text": "Ever since the outbreak of coronavirus at the global stage and WHO declaring it as pandemic on 11th February 2020, multiple speculations started surfacing for controlling this outbreak. Prediction for active cases turned out to be the most highlighted research, as flattening the curve was a primary goal everyone was aiming for. Various Mathematical and Artificial Intelligence based models [6, 7, 8, 9] were used for this task to provide government, health advisories and policy makers substantial information that would help them make decisions. No study has been done so far that incorporates the effect of environmental factors in these models. These factors might not only help us improve the general fit of the predictive model but also provide us with a deeper insight into ways of curbing the spread. Despite the above, there is no conclusive evidence in the past literature which states whether temperature or humidity play a role in affecting the infection rate. The research community had diverse opinions on these two factors. In this study we tried to address this issue and examined the causal association of temperature and humidity with the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Jingui et. al stated that coronavirus is positively affected with temperature [1] . The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was used to show association between temperature and rate of infection in this paper [2] . Another significant study was done to portray the effects of temperature and humidity in death rates for COVID patients in Wuhan, China stating that humidity was negatively correlated with COVID [2] . Even in this study the GAM model was used to depict the association of humidity with the infection rate. Ye Yao et. al stated in his research that there is no significant association of COVID-19 with temperature and UV radiations in Chinese cities; exploring the association through various regression methods [3] . Investigations done by Jingyuan et. al suggested that high temperature and high humidity reduces the transmission of COVID-19 based on cross sectional regression analysis. [4] . Extending ideas from the above, our study investigates various causal effects of temperature and humidity on active COVID-19 cases for selected countries around the world. Causal Inference can state how one factor can transmit its effect on other factors, and also make connection of an effect with its cause. We have used three different causality tests for finding these critical insights and state conclusively whether temperature and humidity have an effect in the rate of infections or not.",

But one may also encounter numerical data that may have originated from a Deterministic Dynamical System. Coupled differential equations can be used to model such systems. However, there are many cases where only a few variables which are relevant to the system are available for the researchers. To tackle this, Taken's Theorem [11] known as Phase-State Reconstruction was used, which states that the properties of dynamical system's attractor can be recovered using a single one of its variables. Using this theorem, Sugihara et al. (2012) developed the new mapping technique named Convergent-Cross Mapping (CCM) [12] , this enabled the recovery of direction of causality between any two time sequences that are generated by the same deterministic dynamical system. To identify causal association, we embedded our time series in 3 dimensions series. And from the embedded time series we created a library and randomly sampled 100 samples from each library. Pearson correlation is used to score the cross-mapping performance, where the correlation was assumed to be greater than 0.80 for significant causal association. rEDM R package used to perform this analysis [14] .",

For Canada, India and the UK, new cases were found to be increasing with rising temperature.

India being a populous and dense country faces a higher risk of spread. However policy interventions such as lockdown at the very beginning kept the spread linear in India. While medical facilities, policies interventions have been implemented, it has been a general question since the very beginning that can temperature and humidity be of any help in reducing the spread. This has been observed in other pandemics such as Influenza spread in 2009 [15] that, with increase in the temperature and humidity the spread reduced. Also for SARS-COV1 spread it has been reported that dry and cold air can lead to the spread. For Sars-cov2 as well, many studies have happened which assert the association between weather conditions and the spread of the virus. However, in our knowledge, none of these efforts involve study of the causal effect of weather on the spread, mere associations can mislead the policy makers and can cost millions of lives. In this paper, we performed causal study between weather conditions with temperature and relative humidity with daily count of new infection. To involve large variability of the weather conditions, we have involved different geographical and political locations of the countries as shown in figure1. We employed a comprehensive statistical analysis to estimate the causal relationship between the time-series. It turned out the majority of the countries does not hold the significant causal relationships as computed using Granger Causality, transfer entropy and crossconvergent mapping, however a few were found to have causal relationships between weather conditions and new cases of covid19. Analysis was carried out separately for each of these in order to account for latent variability hidden within geographical and political diversity. Finally, we fitted a smoothing spline function using generalized additive models using Poisson regression to see direction of relationships. In general, most of the countries were found to have no-causal relationships. We looked at the different Geographies according to the division done by WHO [19] for different counties, we found that Canada, India and the United Kingdom were having an increased number of cases with increase in the temperature. The directionality found here is opposite to what is reported in literature for Influenza. Therefore, it would not be recommendable to take policy decisions on the basis of temperature and relative humidity as of now.",
