This form of physical isolation allows the possibility of effective measures ensuring successful social distancing, preventing large population movements which may encourage spread of infection. National jurisdictions may be able to function more efficiently in small populations. Legislation enforcing public health measures such as social distancing and processes to protect the elderly and vulnerable individuals may be more effective at reaching the general citizenship of a nation 1 .",

Moreover, eyeballing the disease spread in some countries that have been hard hit by Covid-19 infection, there appears to be a correlation of Covid-19 infection rates and ambient salinity as in Qom and Bergamo. Other examples of this correlation are France and the U.K. The high salinity Brittany (Brest) region had fewer infection rates compared to the central (Paris) and eastern regions in France (lower salinity). Similarly, the South East region of the U.K. with higher saline levels had lower Covid-19 infection rates compared to London which appears to have a lower Chloride Ion Wet Deposition. This can also be seen in Italy whereby the saline deficient Lombardy region ( Bergamo) was severely affected by Covid-19 infection, while the more saline rich south of Italy ( Napoli) have very low infection rates.",

In snowbound countries, where salt is applied to roads to encourage snow to melt, aerosolization of the salt together with PM2.5 has been noted 10 . The amalgamation of sodium chloride to PM2.5 may consequently attenuate the inflammatory effect of the polluting particle. Inflamed pulmonary tissue may act as an ideal pabulum for the Covid-19 virus to adhere to the epithelium and the presence of sodium chloride may inhibit viral adhesion and infective activity. Recent evidence suggests that Covid-19 may have \"piggy-backed\" on to PM2.5 particles to evade the bronchial tree defences and colonize the alveoli 11 . The presence of sodium chloride on PM2.5 particles may act as a deterrent against the concomitant adhesion of Covid-19 to these particles, protecting populations living in regions with high salinity.",
