SIRS, which is referred to as sepsis when the inflammatory response is induced by infection, can lead to dire consequences, including multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. ARDS is a prototypic acute inflammatory lung disease and MODS associated with SIRS is characterized by diffuse organ damage with prominent neutrophilic inflammation. The paradox of SIRS is that host immune responses are critical for defense against infection, but excessive or dysregulated inflammation seems to result in neutrophil-mediated tissue injury and organ dysfunc-tion. Understanding the molecular events that regulate neutrophilic inflammation could facilitate specific intervention to prevent host tissue injury in SIRS without substantially compromising the host defense.",

            "text": "Recently, the signalling pathways from specific receptors to activation of NF-kB have been worked out for both TNF-a and IL-1b [11\u00b114]. TNF-a activates NF-kB primarily through binding to the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR1), which then induces a signal transduction cascade through several intermediate signalling proteins, resulting in activation of NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK), a member of the mitogen-activating protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase (MAP3 K) family [11] . When TNF-a binds to the TNFR1, there is an association between the cytoplasmic domain of TNFR1 and the TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), the receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and the TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF-2) that forms an active signalling complex that interacts with NIK. Activation of NIK results in phosphorylation of IkB kinases (IKK), which binds to and phosphorylates IkB-a at serines 32 and 36 [11, 12] . Phosphorylated IkBa is targeted for destruction by the ubiquitinization/proteasome (26 S) degradation pathway, allowing the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus [1, 15, 16] . IL-1b binding to its receptor also results in NIK and IKK activation, followed by IkB-a degradation [17\u00b120]. IL-1b binds to the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) and the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) facilitates an interaction between IL1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6) that results in activation of NIK, IKK and NF-kB. In combination, these data seems to indicate that NIK is a common mediator in the NF-kB signalling cascade that results from receptor mediated TNF and IL-1 stimulation. Although it is likely that activation by endotoxin (LPS) follows a similar scheme, the specific link to NIK has not yet been established. A simplified version of the TNFa and IL-1b pathways is illustrated in Fig. 1 .",

Investigations regarding the role of NF-kB in humans have only recently been undertaken. In the peripheral blood monocytes of patients with sepsis, NF-kB activation predicts mortality [28] . Specifically, all the patients in this study who died from sepsis had increased NF-kB activation (greater than twice baseline) in the first 6 days, whereas all the patients who survived had NF-kB activation that remained less than twice baseline at each time point during the 14-day study period. Also, NF-kB is activated in the alveolar macrophages from patients with ARDS to a significantly higher degree than in alveolar macrophages from critically ill patients with other diseases [29] .

These proteins form an active signalling complex that also results in activation of NIK and IKK leading to the sequence of events that results in activation of NF-kB. Activation of NF-kB results in expression of mRNA of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators (see Table 1 ) which are involved in the pathogenesis of SIRS, MODS and ARDS. IkB is also induced by NF-kB activation and contributes to the down-regulation of this intracellular signalling cascade fective in limiting mortality and improving the pathophysiology of experimental SIRS, none has been shown to be efficacious in human studies. Blocking a single mediator, especially after the initiating insult, might be insufficient to inhibit NF-kB significantly because of the redundancy of proximal mediators with the potential to activate NF-kB. In vitro studies have shown that blocking the individual cytoplasmic components of the TNFa and IL-1b activation pathways, including TRADD, RIP, TRAF-2 and TRAF-6, is an effective way to block activation of NF-kB. Strategies that manipulate these intracellular signalling molecules have not been tried in animal models and are far from clinical trials in human diseases. Furthermore, none of these molecules appears to be both a critical and essential pathway for activation of NF-kB. Several recent reviews, including our own, have addressed many of these anti-cytokine strategies and their limitations [36\u00b137]. Here, we discuss several potential treatment strategies that suppress NF-kB activation by a variety of stimuli and have the potential globally to down-regulate acute inflammation in SIRS (Table 3) . While some of these approaches are already feasible (antioxidants, corticosteroids and induction of endotoxin tolerance), more specific treatments (inhibition of NIK and IKK, and the proteosome inhibitors) will be dependent on advances in technology and close cooperation between pharmaceutical companies and clinical scientists.",

The critical common pathway that leads to activation of NF-kB, activation of IKK by NIK, is rapidly being reported in the literature at an unprecedented pace. Two specific IkB kinases (IKKa and IKKb) have been identified [11\u00b113], which phosphorylate IkBa on serine 32 and 36 that is required for processing via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Overexpression of either an inactive IKKa or IKKb mutant associates with both IkBa and NIK and blocks activation of NF-kB by TNFa and IL-1b [11, 13] . These data seem to indicate that the IkB kinase complex, termed the IkB kinase (IKK) signalsome, involves aggregation of two distinct kinases, IKKa and IKKb, that are activated by an interaction with NIK [61\u00b162]. An inactive NIK mutant has been shown to block activation of NF-kB TNFa and IL-1b, which suggests NIK is a critical step that leads to activation of the IKK signalsome [63] . Recently, it has been shown that NIK activates the IKK signalsome by phosphorylating IKKa, but not IKKb, at serine 176 [14] . Currently there is a frenzied search for compounds that specifically block or antagonize NIK and/or the IKK signalsome since these agents could have broad clinical applications for the treatment of a wide variety of inflammatory diseases that include SIRS, MODS and ARDS. It is likely that a highly specific blockade of NIK and the IKK signalsome will be required because the use of less specific kinase blockers has yielded conflicting results [52\u00b160].

Some of the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids are mediated through inhibition of NF-kB activation. Corticosteroids have been shown to block NF-kB activation in vitro in two ways. First, glucocorticoid receptors can interact directly with RelA, the transactivating component of NF-kB, to inhibit DNA binding [72] . More recently, two separate groups of investigators have shown that dexamethasone, a potent corticosteroid, increases the expression of IkB-a mRNA and synthesis of functional IkB-a protein [73, 74] . Although further research is necessary, inhibition of DNA binding of RelA and stabilization of cytoplasmic NF-kB by a relative excess of newly synthesized IkB may be an effective dual mechanism by which steroids block the synthesis of cytokines. Although corticosteroids have not proven to be beneficial in post-treatment studies of patients with SIRS and ARDS, sufficient inhibition of NF-kB may not have been achieved, and glucocorticoids may have other effects that are detrimental in this condition.",

Rats were rendered endotoxin-tolerant by four daily injections of low dose endotoxin. When endotoxin-tolerant rats were treated with high dose intraperitoneal endotoxin injection, they had decreased NF-kB activation and chemokine gene expression in lung tissue, as well as attenuated neutrophilic lung inflammation compared to endotoxin-sensitive rats [75\u00b176] . Studies in a rat alveolar macrophage cell line indicate that the mechanism of the tolerance effect is related to depletion of RelA [77] . Other investigators have shown a second mechanism of in vitro endotoxin tolerance: increased gene expression of p105 that results in excess production and homodimerization of p50 [78] . This has the overall effect of preventing gene activation, since p50 homodimers do not bind to IkB and can bind to the decameric NF-kB DNA sequence, but lack a transactivating domain. Exploiting the natural phenomenon of endotoxin tolerance may be an effective way to suppress NF-kB-dependent inflammation. Several studies in animal models and clinical trials have suggested that the induction of tolerance might be effective in selected patients with SIRS [79\u00b181]. These data lead us to believe that induction of endotoxin could be used to prevent or relieve at least some sequelae of gram-negative sepsis through inhibition of NF-kB-dependent inflammatory gene expression.",

Second, agents that activate NF-kB in cells (including endotoxin, TNFa, IL-1b and ionizing radiation) produce oxidative stress [38]. Third, antioxidants have been shown to inhibit NF-kB activation in a variety of settings both in vitro [38] and in vivo [22]. Fourth, up-regulation of endogenous oxidant defenses has been demonstrated to suppress NF-kB activation [39]. In rats, we have shown that systemic endotoxin treatment induces oxidative stress and NF-kB activation in lung tissue and that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can inhibit lung tissue NF-kB activation following systemic endotoxin treatment [22]. Activation of NF-kB in vitro is also inhibited by a variety of other antioxidant agents including vitamin E derivatives [40\u00b141], pyrroli-",
