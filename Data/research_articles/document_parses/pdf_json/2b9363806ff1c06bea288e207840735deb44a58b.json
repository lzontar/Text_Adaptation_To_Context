In 2003, the hospital accreditation reform was carried out and began to focus on patient-centered care and patient safety environment, which had a great impact on medical system of Taiwan. The contents of hospital accreditation include all medical specialties, hospital management, nursing, pharmacy, radiology, medical rehabilitation, and medical technology, etc. Before dental medicine included in the hospital accreditation, there were only 3 recognized dental specialties (oral and maxillofacial surgery, oral pathology, and orthodontics) to participate in hospital accreditation. Other dental specialties and dental care were excluded from hospital accreditation. 2 As late as 2011, the accreditation criteria for teaching hospitals have been significantly revised, and hospital dentistry including the resident training program, the dental trainee student training program, and the new dentist training program (that is, post-graduate year training program for dentists or PGYD) has been officially incorporated into the teaching hospital accreditation system. By 2015, dental care accreditation standards were integrated into hospital accreditation standards, and dental care (including \"improving dental patient safety, improving medical service quality, transforming medical treatment environment, and taking care of vulnerable groups\") was officially incorporated into the hospital accreditation system. Due to the lack of emphasis on dentistry in many hospitals in the past, the development of hospital dentistry has been uneven in these hospitals. For example, the number of dentists in the dental department of the medical center varies from 6 to 80. Moreover, there are also many hospitals that have the scale of dental department even smaller than that of a local dental clinic. Therefore, the accreditation objects of dental care are mainly from regional hospitals and above, and district hospitals are exempt from the dental care. 3 Although it starts late that the hospital dentistry is included in the teaching hospital accreditation and hospital accreditation system, it is still very important to improve the overall quality of dental services in the hospitals.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 168, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 992, "end": 993, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2272, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In addition to the hospital accreditation system, there are other ways to access the dental manpower.

For example, we previously found that only 8 oral pathology specialists practice both anatomical oral pathology and oral medicine, and all of them are in university hospitals or medical centers. 11 In addition, pediatric dentistry has just been implemented in 2019, and it may be the object of study in the near future.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 164, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1706, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 936, "end": 945, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We also found that the number of hospital general dentists (1,699) plus hospital dental specialists (500) was slightly fewer than the number of overall hospital dentists (2, 211) in Taiwan (Table 2 ). The possible reason was that a small number of dentists obtained the qualification of a medical specialist before 1991 and registered this medical specialty instead of a dental specialty. 11 From the difference between the number of overall dentists and the number of dentists in hospitals, the number of dentists in dental clinics could be calculated. 9 Further analysis of the dental specialist-to-dentist ratio, we calculated and found that the ratios were 22.61% (500/2211) for the hospitals, 4.77% (602/12,614) for the dental clinics, and 7.43% (1102/ 14,825) for the overall dental institutions in Taiwan. Moreover, the dental specialist-to-dentist ratios were 0.30 (366/1213) for medical centers, 0.15 (116/770) for regional hospitals, and 0.08 (18/228) for district hospitals ( Table 2 ). In the United States, the number of dental specialists has increased during the past 50 years. Less than 10% of the dentists are specialists in 1970, but 22% of the dentists are specialists in 2009. It is predicted that the percentage will increase to 27% in 2022, and most dental specialists are in the urban area. 12 Currently, the proportion of dental specialists in Taiwan was still low and concentrated in the large hospitals. In a previous study, approximately 350e400 dental students graduated from dental schools each year, and approximately 1/4 of the newly-graduated dentists chose to participate in further dental specialty training. 2 Therefore, with the implementation of the comprehensive dental specialist system in 2018, it is also predicted that the number and proportion of dental specialists will continue to grow, especially in large hospitals. 13 The dentist-to-population ratio is the first core indicator used by the WHO to assess whether the number of health workers relative to the population is adequate. It can be used to monitor the most basic needs of healthcare to be achieved in a country, and can be used for comparative analysis among several countries or several regions of a country. 4 Based on the data of our previous study in October 2019, the total population of Taiwan is approximately 23.59 million, the number of dentists is 14,825, and the number of people served by each dentist is 1,592, equivalent to 62.8 dentists per 100,000 people, which is better than the datum of 61 dentists per 100,000 people reported in 2009 in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. 4 Thus, the current dentist manpower in Taiwan is exactly oversupplied. 9 To view each region of Taiwan separately, the numbers of overall dentists were 7829 in the northern region, 3032 in the central region, 3544 in the southern region, 395 in the eastern region, and 25 in the offshore islands (Table 3) . We calculated the numbers of people served by each dentist in above regions, which were 1,314, 1,916, 1,792, 2526 and 6,125, respectively. Meanwhile, these numbers were equivalent to 76.1, 52.2, 55.8, 39.6 and 16.3 dentists per 100,000 people, respectively. It is obvious that only the dentist manpower of the northern region of Taiwan is comparable or superior to OECD countries. The dentist manpower of other regions even lags behind that of OECD countries of 10 years ago, especially the dentist manpower of the eastern region of Taiwan and the offshore islands. Unfortunately, this also reflects that the geographical distribution of dentist manpower in Taiwan is in an extremely unbalanced status.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 173, "text": "(2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 174, "end": 178, "text": "211)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 389, "end": 391, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 554, "end": 555, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1314, "end": 1316, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1644, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1863, "end": 1865, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2218, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2640, "end": 2641, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2712, "end": 2713, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 197, "text": "Taiwan (Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 987, "end": 994, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2937, "end": 2946, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In this study, all aspects of dental resources and manpower including the hospitals with dental departments, dentists, dental technicians, and dental specialists in the hospitals, and overall dentists were mostly concentrated in the northern region of Taiwan, followed by the central and southern regions of Taiwan, the eastern region of Taiwan, and offshore islands. The average numbers of hospital dentists, dental technicians, and dental specialists had a similar geographical distribution as above. We also found that the hospitals in the northern region of Taiwan had the largest hospital dentistry scale compared with hospitals in the other regions of Taiwan. These results were consistent with those in other previous studies. 2, 13, 14 An unbalanced urban-rural distribution of dentists was noted in Taiwan. Therefore, how to balance the dental manpower resources in different regions of Taiwan will be a vital issue that needs further studies in the future. 2, 13, 14 We conclude that the hospital dentistry in Taiwan develops toward large-scale and specialization. Both hospital general dentists and dental specialists are predominantly concentrated in the medical centers, especially the medical centers in the northern region of Taiwan, indicating the problem of oversupply and unbalanced distribution of dentists in the northern region of Taiwan. Although there are less than 15% of total dentists working in the hospitals, the hospital dentistry is still responsible for training of new dentists and dental research, which is important for the cultivation and development of young dentists. 2 With the implementation of the comprehensive dental specialist system, the number and proportion of hospital dentists may continue to increase in the future. When facing the problem of oversupply and unbalanced distribution of dentists, the responsibilities of the hospitals with dental departments are to develop the elderly and disabled dentistry and to provide dental care for these persons. In addition, the administrators of hospitals should reduce the working hours of the hospital dentists, especially the working hours of the training dentists (such as dentists in specialist training program and PGY trainees) and interns to improve their quality of life.
