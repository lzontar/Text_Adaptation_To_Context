Forty premature infants were included; 13 samples were positive in 10 newborns (coronaviruses n = 10; influenza 1 n = 2; adenovirus n = 1). None was positive at admission. All premature infants infected with coronaviruses had symptoms of bradycardia, apnea, hypoxemia, fever or abdominal distension. Chest X-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates in two cases. However, no significant difference was observed between infected and non-infected premature infants for gestational age, birth weight, duration of ventilation, age at discharge, incidence of apnea or bradycardia.

Indeed, young age (less than 1 month) and prematurity are two major risk factors (1). Nosocomial respiratory infections can occur sporadically or as an epidemic. The precise incidence has not been established. The variability or even absence of clinical symptomatology, especially in very immature newborn infants ( 2 ) , makes all retrospective evaluations difficult. Numerous viral agents have been implicated. The most frequently reported viruses are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (1, 3) , adenoviruses (4), influenza viruses A and B, and parainfluenza viruses I, I1 and 111 (5). The coronavirus (CV) has also been implicated. We have previously reported four cases of upper respiratory tract infection in premature newborns presenting with attacks of apnea of sudden onset (6).

RSV, the primary cause of bronchiolitis in infancy, has also been implicated as the cause of epidemics of chest infections in neonatal intensive care units (2, 3 ) and can worsen pre-existing respiratory disease. In this study, no sample was positive for RSV. On the other hand, we have seen a high rate of occurrence of infection with CV. CVs are RNA viruses with a spherical shape covered with projections similar to a \"crown\". Two main strains of human CV have been identified: 229 E and OC (7) . These viruses are commonly implicated in benign upper respiratory tract infections in adults (7), reproduced experimentally in healthy volunteers (8) . They are also implicated in acute decompensation in chronic respiratory insufficiency (9) .",

On the Similarly, in a prospective study by Ray et al., based on serological analysis and cell culture from acute lower respiratory tract infections in children less than 3 years of age, human CV viruses, as initial infecting agents, were not found to be responsible (12) . The difficulty in culturing CVs and the absence of serological specificity probably explain these findings (1 3) .",
