For trainees, the route to competence may be obvious, with detailed and specific curricula to follow. 3 Even then, trainees are often exposed to equipment with little or no official training. 1 However, for those who are no longer in training, who form the majority of practitioners, the task may be more challenging, with limited guidance on how to maintain competence with existing equipment or to achieve it when new equipment is introduced. To address this, the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) have made some strides towards mandating triennial airway rescue training, 4 but in practice this can be avoided by choosing other educational options and there is a strong argument that, in focusing only on the front-ofneck airway techniques, the wrong skillset is being emphasised. 5 In many other counties there is no process for mandating skills retention or acquisition whatsoever. In the UK barely half of trained anaesthetists get any locally delivered skills training. 6 The adage 'practice makes perfect' is relevant here: 'reinforcement learning' has been studied by neurobiologists in some detail. In simple terms, neuronal circuits act as either 'actors' (those that produce an action/behaviour) or 'critics' (those that relay feedback on the outcome of that action/behaviour) to fine tune motor skills and behaviours. 7 These interactions reinforce adjustments that bring the action or behaviour closer to the desired outcome until it is honed. Consequently, in addition to other benefits such as knowledge and familiarity, using advanced or rescue airway equipment during our normal practice, rather than only during difficulty, will hone those motor skills we need to acquire for both competence and expertise.",

Videolaryngoscopy enables a better view at laryngoscopy with greater operator ease and less force. 8 It leads to fewer grade 3-4 views and fewer intubation failures. Benefits are particularly evident in higher risk patients. 8 However, benefits of videolaryngoscopy are limited to those practitioners experienced in its use; direct laryngoscopy skills do not translate into skill with videolaryngoscopy, especially devices with hyperangulated blades. 8 Gill reported that more UK anaesthetists with an interest in advanced airway management believed they were competent to teach videolaryngoscopy than had used the devices more than ten times! 9 For many anaesthetic procedures there is a steep learning curve for the first 30 cases, but with the learning curve not flattening off beyond at least 100 cases. 10 Regarding hyperangulated videolaryngoscopy, 76 uses were reported to be required to achieve reliable performance. 11 This sustained acquisition of expertise chimes with our own local experience where, after five years of universal videolaryngoscopy, we are still gaining in expertise. 12 The 2015 DAS guidelines state that anaesthetists should be \"trained to use, and have immediate access to, a videolaryngoscope\", and that they should be \"experts\". 13 This begs the question as to whether videolaryngoscopy should be used solely as a rescue device or routinely. A 2012 UK survey reported that only 57% had access to videolaryngoscopes. 9 By 2017, the vast majority of UK hospitals had videolaryngoscopes, but access was often restricted to the main operating theatre suite and absent in many clinical settings. 14 Critically, routine use was reported in fewer than one third of hospitals and was sometimes restricted to specified individuals, training was often inadequate and attitudes to use of videolaryngoscopy were inconsistent.",

By limiting available airway equipment -and therefore choice -to that known to be most likely to achieve success in a crisis, we can improve decision-making and 'algorithm transitioning'.

Using weighted scores across several domains of safety and efficacy based on available 'all source' evidence, second-generation SGAs were calculated to outperform their predecessors in all areas of practice, and particularly for airway rescue. 20 The 2015 DAS guidelines recommend second-generation SGAs as rescue devices. 13 This was reinforced in the 2018 guidance for airway management of the critically ill. 21 If both firstand second-generation SGAs are available when difficulty is encountered, the practitioner must actively weigh the benefits and limitations of each before choosing one device. A more inexperienced practitioner may make the incorrect choice or lose precious time while deciding. Even when the correct decision is made, this may not be anticipated by the assistant, adding further delay. If instead only one or two second-generation SGAs are available, both for routine use and as a rescue device, then in a crisis situation not only is the correct equipment immediately available but practitioners are practised and skilled in their use, delays in crisis decision-making are minimised, assistants are more likely to anticipate correctly and algorithm transitioning is enhanced.

The NAP4 recommended that a surgical cricothyroidotomy approach be taught to all anaesthetists 2 , and the 2015 DAS guidelines recommended a scalpel-bougie-tube approach as the default technique. 13 Both emphasised universal training and a single approach within any one hospital. This has been further emphasised in cross-specialty documents. 24 Although rarely used, eFONA equipment, when needed, must be immediately available and the team familiar with and confident in its use in order to save a life in extremis. 2 Delay in performing eFONA is likely to be a greater cause of harm than procedural complications. Despite this, a small UK survey reported that more than 1 in 4 anaesthetists could not confirm that an eFONA kit was available in their institution. 25 Conversely, a survey of Australasian anaesthetic departments reported immediate availability and visibility of point-of-care eFONA equipment in > 80% of operating theatres, though this was the case in only around half of satellite locations. 26 Current UK practice is unknown.",

Point of care eFONA kits (a scalpel, a bougie and a tracheal tube) are boxed and available in every location where anaesthesia takes place. Workshop-based airway training,which includes training in use of all the equipment described in this editorial and all techniques necessary in the 2015 DAS algorithms, was made mandatory for all anaesthesia and intensive care department members four years ago, with 100% compliance. When airway difficulty arises in clinical practice, the equipment deployed is instantly available, and is that which is in routine use and with which we and our assistants are trained, familiar and skilled or expert. Introducing these changes in practice was not without barriers, but we firmly believe that it has improved the standard and reliability of airway management throughout the hospital and improved patient care. It has reduced the frequency of airway crises with no eFONA performed in 6 years. We would not wish to return to previous non-standardised approaches.",

[28] [29] [30] [31] Together the COVID-19 guidelines encapsulate the concepts discussed above. They advocate for safe, accurate and swift airway management. 28 This cannot be achieved without institutional, team and individual preparedness. Equipment standardisation and routine use of equipment that will be used in an emergency is a logical central component of each of these goals. In the short term it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 will be an endemic infection and the need to ensure safe, accurate and swift airway management with remain. It is quite possible airway management will have been changed forever. We will watch with interest to learn what lessons the airway community has learnt from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but the above principles offer a template for safe practice now.",
