Using single-cell technologies in models of respiratory viral infection, we found that lung cDC2s acquired expression of the Fc receptor CD64 shared with MCs and of IRF8 shared with cDC1s. These inflammatory cDC2s (inf-cDC2s) were superior in inducing CD4 + T helper (Th) cell polarization while simultaneously presenting antigen to CD8 + T cells. When carefully separated from inf-cDC2s, MCs lacked APC function. Inf-cDC2s matured in response to cell-intrinsic Toll-like receptor and type 1 interferon receptor signaling, upregulated an IRF8-dependent maturation module, and acquired antigens via convalescent serum and Fc receptors. Because hybrid inf-cDC2s are easily confused with monocyte-derived cells, their existence could explain why APC functions have been attributed to MCs.",

However, the selectivity and validity of these approaches mainly derives from studies that have measured cell surface markers and IRF expression in the steady state without properly questioning how expression is altered by inflammation. Moreover, as soon as tissue inflammation is present, Ly6C hi CD11b + CD172a + monocytes enter antigen-exposed barrier sites and lymph nodes (LNs). Monocytes can then rapidly upregulate the expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHCII) and CD11c while downregulating expression of Ly6C. These cells are known by various names, like monocyte-derived cells (MCs), monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), or inflammatory DCs, and can be easily confused with CD11b + CD172a + cDC2s, particularly because they also express CD11b, CD172a, and intermediate amounts of IRF4 (Le\u00f3 n et al., 2007; Menezes et al., 2016; Naik et al., 2006; Plantinga et al., 2013) . Although MafB lineage tracing studies suggest that MCs are much more related to macrophages than DCs, they perform well in ex vivo antigen presentation assays, leading to their classification as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and their designation as moDCs (Cheong et al., 2010; Kool et al., 2008a Kool et al., , 2008b Le\u00f3 n et al., 2007; Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994; . Although cDCs readily migrate to draining nodes, MCs are usually less migratory.",

However, CD64 has been reported to also identify a subset of kidney cDCs in the steady state (Schraml et al., 2013) . Understanding which APCs express Fc receptors is important because uptake of antigen via convalescent serum or immune complexes is an effective way of targeting antigen to APCs dur-ing an ongoing primary or recall immune response (Guilliams et al., 2014b; Lehmann et al., 2017) .",

Another DC population appeared, expressing CD26 and CD172a like cDC2s but was marked by expression of CD64 and MAR-1 (Figures 1B and 1D) , which we termed CD26 + CD64 + MAR-1 + DCs. The intensity of CD64 staining on CD26 + CD64 + DCs was between that of cDCs and that of MCs ( Figure 1D ), but without use of CD26, it would be very difficult to separate these cells from MCs. Following viral clearance, CD26 + CD64 + MAR-1 + DCs were no longer identifiable in the lung, but cDC and MC numbers remained elevated at 18 dpi ( Figure 1C ).",

These CD26 + MHCII + CD11c + cells expressed CD64 and MAR-1 at an intensity comparable with lung equivalents (Figures 1F, 1D , and 1H) and were no longer detectable in MLNs following recovery from viral infection (Figure 1G) .

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) acting on Csf-2r has been shown to play a cell-intrinsic pro-survival role in resident cDC homeostasis in vivo . In wild-type (WT):Csf2rb \u00c0/\u00c0 chimeras, Csf2rb signaling was, however, not intrinsically required for generation of MAR-1 + DCs and MCs ( Figure S1I ). Dependency on the chemokine receptor CCR2 is widely used to define monocyte descent (Serbina and Pamer, 2006) , but it has been shown that subtypes of tissue CD11b + cDC2s also depend on CCR2 (Nakano et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2015) . In WT:Ccr2 \u00c0/\u00c0 chimeras infected with the virus, cDC1s derived equally well from both donors, whereas MCs were generated preferentially from the WT donor component.",

After 4 days of co-culture, cDC2s retrieved from MLNs at 8 dpi were more efficient in inducing virus-specific CD4 + T cell proliferation compared with cDC1s ( Figure 2A ). Inf-cDC2s induced the highest degree of CD4 + T cell proliferation (Figures 2A-2C ), whereas cDC1s were superior in inducing proliferation of CD8 + T cells. Inf-cDC2s performed better than their classical cDC2 counterparts in stimulating CD8 + T cell immunity (Figures 2B and 2C) . IFN-g was produced in much larger quantities when CD4 + T cells were co-cultured with inf-cDC2s compared with cDC2s or cDC1s ( Figure 2D ). In contrast, IFN-g production by CD8 + T cells was higher upon stimulation with cDC1s compared with cDC2s, but again, inf-cDC2s were more potent in inducing IFN-g production from dividing CD8 + T cells (Figure 2D) . MCs that were sorted from the lungs and carefully separated from inf-cDC2s could not induce proliferation of naive CD4 + or CD8 + T cells whereas lung inf-cDC2s readily did ( Figure 2E ). However, when exogenous preprocessed peptide was added to MCs, they readily induced proliferation (Figure 2E) . Thus, inf-cDC2s, which represent the dominant DC population in lung-draining LNs at the peak of PVM infection, can optimally prime CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses to virus.",

In addition, MAR-1 staining was intact in inf-cDCs of Fcer1a \u00c0/\u00c0 virus-in-fected mice ( Figure 2L ) and abolished in Fcer1g \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Figure 2L) . Thus, as reported previously (Tang et al., 2019), MAR-1 recognizes an unknown epitope of an activating Fc receptor on inf-cDC2s and MCs. Because activating Fc receptors like CD64 and CD16b (FcgRIV) can target antigens to macrophages and DCs via binding surface immunoglobulin G (IgG) or uptake of immune complexes (Guilliams et al., 2014b; Lehmann et al., 2017) , we next tested whether this would be a specialized function of inf-cDC2s. Heat-inactivated convalescent immune serum (IS) from PVM-infected mice (PVM-IS, obtained at 15 dpi) or control serum from mock-infected mice was transferred to another cohort of infected mice at 6 dpi, and DC subsets were sorted from MLNs 36 h later. Compared with mock serum, PVM-IS transfer led to enhanced capacity of inf-cDC2s to present antigen to CD4 + T cells, which led to higher T cell division ( Figure 2M ) and increased numbers of IFN-g producing T cells ( Figure 2N ). This effect was not seen when cDC2s were sorted from Fcer1g \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Figures S3A and S3B). Transfer of convalescent PVM-IS did not enhance the capacity of cDC1s or MAR-1 -cDC2s to present viral antigen.",

Strikingly, 48 h later, all CD64 and MAR-1 staining had disappeared from the total pool of lung cDC2s as well as MCs when ICs were injected ( Figure 2O ). This was due to Fc receptor-mediated internalization by inf-cDC2s because the amount of internalized OVA-Alexa Fluor 647 in MHCII + CD11c + CD11b + cells comprising cDC2s and MCs was much higher following injection of OVA-Alexa Fluor 647-IC compared with OVA-Alexa Fluor 647 alone ( Figure 2P ).

            "text": "Inf-cDC2s Develop Normally in the Absence of IRF4 and IRF8 IRF8 drives cDC1 development, whereas IRF4 drives cDC2s. In line with the cDC2 origin of inf-DCs, IRF4 was expressed at baseline and minimally altered by infection ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Figure S2F ). Lung inf-cDC2s upregulated IRF8 relative to their MAR-1 \u00c0 cDC2 counterparts, and this was even more marked after migration of inf-cDC2s to the MLN, where the intensity of IRF8 staining almost reached that of cDC1s (Figure 3A and 3B; Figure S2G) . We next questioned whether IRF8 was needed to drive inf-cDC2s development. Irf8 fl/fl Itgax-cre mice lack cDC1, potentially affecting viral clearance and confounding comparisons with WT mice because of immunopathology. We therefore generated CD45.1 WT:CD45.2 Irf8 fl/fl Itgax-cre mixed BM chimeric mice ( Figure 3C ) which were infected with PVM 12 weeks later. At 10 dpi, cDC1s in the lungs and MLNs were almost exclusively derived from the WT CD45.1 BM compartment ( Figure 3D ). In contrast, cDC2s and inf-cDC2s were derived equally well from the WT and Irf8 \u00c0/\u00c0 BM compartments, although inf-cDC2s had a slightly higher WT:Irf8 fl/fl Itgax-cre ratio compared with cDC2s ( Figure 3D ). Lack of IRF4 in CD11c + cells of Irf4 fl/fl Itgaxcre mice resulted in a reduction in cDC2s in the lungs and a severe reduction in migratory cDC2s in MLNs in the steady state (Baja\u00f1 a et al., 2016) . Although lung inf-cDC2s were not affected by loss of IRF4 in infected mice, there was less migration of CCR7 + cDC2s and inf-cDC2s in Irf4 fl/fl Itgax-cre mice to MLNs ( Figures S4A-S4E) . A subset of CD301b(MGL2) + CD24 + cDC2s known to induce Th2 cell responses (Gao et al., 2013; Kumamoto et al., 2013) was lower in the lungs and MLNs of Irf4 fl/fl Itgax-cre mice; however, this was a minor population of all cDC2s ( Figure S4F ).",

The cDCs were further subdivided into ''non-migratory'' (Ccr7 lo Nudt17 lo ) cDC1s (Cd81 + Gcsam + Xcr1 + Irf8 + ) and cDC2s (Sirpa + S100a4 + CD209a + ) and ''migratory'' (Ccr7 hi Nudt17 hi profile) cDC1s (Cd81 + Gcsam + Laptmb4 + Ncoa7 + ; the latter two genes were chosen because of downregulation of Xcr1 mRNA) and cDC2s (S100a4 + Anxa3 + Cdc42ep3 + ). A small group of cDCs highly expressed genes associated with cell proliferation (Mki67 + Stmn1 + ), confirming reports that cDCs can proliferate in the lungs (Cabeza-Cabrerizo et al., 2019) . Approximately one-third of lung MHCII + CD11c + cells at 10 dpi with PVM in chimeric mice were MCs (expression of Mafb, Mertk, and Fcgr1 and lack of expression of Flt3, Zbtb46, and Dpp4; Figures  3E and 3F ). In the cDC2 compartment, inf-cDC2s were identified based on expression of Fcgr1 and other genes (e.g., Irf8 and Irf4). Although, in flow cytometry analysis, up to 60% of all cDCs were inf-cDC2s ( Figures 1C and 1G) , scRNA-seq revealed only a representation of approximately 20% ( Figure 3E ). This most likely stems from differences in the kinetics of mRNA and protein expression of marker genes, and inf-cDC2s might be masked by downregulation or delayed expression of Fcgr1 mRNA. The most likely cluster where inf-cDC2s are to be expected is the migratory cDC2 cluster because this cluster contains the highest number of Irf8 mRNA + cells.",

The top DEG of the inf-cDC2s subset clearly overlapped between both models of viral respiratory infection ( Figure 3H ), illustrating a common signature of inf-cDC2s. Compared with non-migratory cDC2s and migratory cDC2s, the most discriminative genes in inf-cDC2s were related to a type I IFN signature (e.g., Stat1, Iigp1, Rsad2, ifi205, Isg20, Ifit1, and Ifit3), genes encoding for pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., Ccl5, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10), and genes promoting Th1 cell differentiation (e.g., Il12b), whereas genes involved in Th2 cell development appeared to be downregulated (e.g., Irf4, Klf4, and Mgl2) ( Figures 3G, 3H , and 3K). In line with the flow cytometry data, cDC1s were exclusively derived from the WT compartment ( Figure 3F ). MCs and the entire cDC2 lineage, including inf-cDC2s, developed equally well from both compartments. Sorted pDCs were almost completely derived from the IRF8-deficient compartment. We reported earlier that IRF8-deficient pDCs have higher expression of CD11c, IRF4, and MHCII, which explains why IRF8-deficient pDCs are present in the pool of CD11c + MHCII + cells of these WT:Irf8 fl/fl Itgax-cre chimeras . In WT:WT control mixed BM chimeras, all cell populations were equally derived from both compartments ( Figure S5 ).",

However, the finding that IRF8 was turned on in inf-cDC2 without affecting development gave us the unique opportunity to study the IRF8-dependent genes in cDC2s. We quantified IRF8 regulon activity in cells of chimeric mice by applying the single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) workflow (Aibar et al., 2017) , which predicted a high-confidence regulon governed by IRF8 in the cDC1 lineage. This IRF8 regulon activity was ll Article also observed during cDC2 maturation and migration upon PVM infection, supported by Irf8 mRNA expression in cells with IRF8 regulon activity ( Figure 3I ). We then compared DEG between Irf8 \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT cells in each cluster of cDC2s (i.e., non-migratory cDC2s, migratory cDC2s, and inf-cDC2s). After removal of 9 genes that were differentially expressed because of the congenic background in chimeric mice, a small set of 88 genes was obtained (Figures 3J and 3K) . Most of the IRF8-dependent genes were involved in co-stimulation, T cell differentiation (e.g., promotes Il12b and suppresses Irf4, Klf4, and Ccrl2), and antigen processing and presentation (e.g., Siglecg, Cst3, Fcgrt, and Nlrc5) . In addition to Irf8, other transcription factors associated with cDC1 development and function were adopted by migratory cDC2s, like Id2, Batf3, IL12b, Tap1, Tap2, Tapbp, Tapbpl, B2m, Psme genes, Swap70, Nfil, Nlrc5, and Rab43 (Jaiswal et al., 2013; Kretzer et al., 2016; Figures 3G and 3K) . Genes typically associated with cDC2 function (Irf4, Ciita, H2-DMb2, and Siglecg) were upregulated in Irf8 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells ( Figure 3K ).",

To study the signals leading to inf-cDC2 development, we set up Flt3L BM cultures , which were exposed to agonists of TLR3 (poly(I:C)), TLR4 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TLR7 (R848), and TLR9 (CpG motifs). Because Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the transcriptional profile of inf-cDC2s suggested that Interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1), STAT1, IRF7, and IRF8 were potential upstream regulators of the distinct gene expression profile ( Figure S2E ), cells were also exposed to type 1 and type 2 IFN. After 9 days of culture, XCR1 + CD172a \u00c0 cDC1s and XCR1 \u00c0 CD172a + cDC2s were clearly distinguishable. Without addition of TLR ligands, some cDC2s already expressed MAR-1 and low amounts of CD64. Addition of LPS, poly(I:C), R848, and CpG motifs induced much higher MAR-1 and CD64 on cDC2s, and these cells now resembled inf-cDC2s. Upregulation of MAR-1 on cDC1s was also seen after exposure to poly(I:C) and imiquimod, although the shift was bigger in cDC2s. Type 1 IFN induced CD64 and MAR-1 on cDC2s and cDC1s, whereas IFN-g induced CD64 and MAR-1 exclusively on cDC2s ( Figure 4A ). Mixed cultures set up from 50% CD45.1 WT and 50% CD45.2 Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 BM cells stimulated by medium or TLR7 ligation revealed that spontaneous upregulation of MAR-1 on cDC2s was only seen in the WT compartment but not in the Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 compartment of these mixed cultures, suggesting autocrine production of type 1 IFN and cell-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling (Figure 4B ). Likewise, TLR7-induced upregulation of MAR-1 and CD64 on the WT fraction of cells was almost completely absent in the Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 fraction, suggesting a role of autocrine type 1 IFN in upregulation of activating Fc receptors on cDCs driven by TLR ligation ( Figure 4C ). Similar results were found for the other TLR ligands (data not shown). Type 1 IFN induced upregulation of CD64 and MAR-1 in the WT fraction but not in the Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 fraction.",

This increased uptake was intrinsically dependent on type I IFN signaling and expression of the Fc common gamma chain (Figures 4E and 4F) .

However, because MAR-1 and CD64 were considered markers of monocyte-derived macrophages at that time, and based on the dependency on CCR2, we called these cells inflammatory monocyte-derived DCs (Hammad et al., 2010; Plantinga et al., 2013) . Given the phenotype of inf-cDC2s in viral lung infections, we repeated this experiment with intratracheal (i.t.) administration of 100 mg of HDM. As reported, MAR-1 + CD64 int CD172a + DCs were found to accumulate in MLNs 3 days after HDM administration in WT mice but not Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Figure 5A) . These MAR-1 + DCs expressed the same amount of the common cDC marker CD26 as cDC1s and MAR-1 \u00c0 cDC2s, arguing for their pre-cDC origin ( Figure 5B ). Like in viral infection, the total cDC2 population in MLNs acquired intermediate IRF8 expression ( Figure 5C ) upon HDM administration, but this was not seen in Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Selected pro-Th2 cell cytokines known to affect DCs, like Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-33, were unable to induce inf-cDC2s in vitro (Figure S3F ). HDM sensitization in combination with LPS and betaglucans promotes neutrophilic inflammation (Hadebe et al., 2015) , and mixed Th2-Th17 cell pulmonary immunity is also found in severe asthmatics. Inf-cDC2s were capable of priming naive Der p 1-specific (1-Der) T cells and induce RORgt and IL-17A expression, but less efficiently than CD64 \u00c0 cDC2s (Figures 5D -5F). Sorted lung MCs were again unable to present endogenously acquired antigen to 1-Der T cells ex vivo, but when preprocessed exogenous Der p 1 peptide was added, they readily induced proliferation.",

Again, no CD26 lo CD64 hi MCs could be identified in the actively migrating MHCII hi DC population in draining LNs ( Figure 5G ). Unique to the skin, a CD26 lo MHCII hi population in ELNs was identified as Langerhans cells (LCs) expressing CD11b and CD326 but not CD64. Conventional CD26 + DCs were further subdivided in XCR1 + cDC1s, CD11b + cDC2s, and TN cDCs.

Inf-cDC2s had upregulated expression of cytokines, chemokines, costimulatory molecules, and Fc receptors in an IFNAR1-dependent manner. Given these hybrid features of inf-cDC2s, sharing expression of activating Fc receptors with MCs and macrophages and the potential to upregulate IRF8 like cDC1s, we suspect that they have often contaminated other populations of APCs. Because most investigators have not used CD26 to precisely define cDCs in the CD11b + CD11c +-MHCII + pool of cells, the mistaken identity of contaminating inf-cDC2 cells might be the main reason why in vivo monocytederived DCs have been shown to be excellent APCs with migratory capacity in models of allergy, vaccination, infection, and cancer (Cheong et al., 2010; Kool et al., 2012; Le\u00f3 n et al., 2007; Min et al., 2018; Nakano et al., 2009; Plantinga et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2007) .

            "text": "The argument that moDCs are important for immunopathology and Th1 cell-mediated immunity has also heavily relied on use of Ccr2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, which have defects in monocyte egress from the BM, moDC and MC recruitment, and Th1 cell induction (Iijima et al., 2011; De Koker et al., 2017; Menezes et al., 2016; Nakano et al., 2009; Sheng et al., 2017; Tamoutounour et al., 2012) . Our data now show that inf-cDC2s are IL-12-producing mature APCs that resemble moDCs and also depend on CCR2 for migrating to the lungs, at least in the setting of respiratory viral infection. These data are in line with reports describing CCR2 expression on circulating Ly6C hi SiglecH + pre-cDC2s and dependence of CD11b + cDC2s on CCR2 in mucosal tissues such as the gut and lungs (Nakano et al., 2017; Schlitzer et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2015) . Use of the CCR2 model and the presence of CD64 +-MAR-1 + -expressing DCs in MLNs have also misled us to suggest that moDCs were drivers of Th2 cell immunity in the HDM model of allergy , an interpretation we would now like to revise. By using CD26 as a defining marker, it is very clear that the moDCs we proposed to migrate to LNs to induce Th2 cell priming after high-dose HDM exposure were, in fact, inf-cDC2s , and we additionally demonstrate how these emerge in a type 1 IFN-dependent manner. These findings also realign our work with that of others proposing that lung inflammatory Ly6C + moDCs are more related to macrophages and have a poor capacity to migrate to lung LNs or prime T cell responses (Mesnil et al., 2012; Nakano et al., 2013; .",

            "text": "Our work has implications for understanding (cross)-presentation and uptake of opsonized antigens through use of convalescent serum. In the steady state, cDC1s have a higher capacity to cross-present cell-bound and particulate antigens to CD8 + T cells, and cDC2s are better at inducing CD4 + T cell responses (Burgdorf et al., 2007; Dudziak et al., 2007; Hildner et al., 2008) . However, many studies have shown that CD11b + DCs and moDCs (MCs) can also stimulate CD8 immunity, particularly in vitro and after cytokine activation in vivo Cheong et al., 2010; Desch et al., 2014; Larson et al., 2016) . As an example, we and others have shown that cDC1s prime CD8 + T cell immunity to influenza virus infection (Geurts-vanKessel et al., 2008; Helft et al., 2012) , whereas others have claimed that CD11b + cDC2s are more proficient (Ainsua-Enrich et al., 2019; Ballesteros-Tato et al., 2010) . Here, using PVM-specific TCR transgenic mice, we show that cDC1s and bona fide CD11b + inf-cDC2s from virus-infected mice are almost equally potent in stimulating CD8 + T cells ex vivo and that inf-cDC2s simultaneously stimulate CD4 + T cell responses, inducing polarization of IFN-g-producing cells. Contrary to dogma, MCs were unable to present viral antigens to naive CD8 + or CD4 + T cells. Therefore, the role of tissue-residing MCs might rather be found in orchestration of the peripheral effector response or inflammation in the presence of antibody-complexed antigen. It will be important to examine whether convalescent serum can activate MCs to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This is a pertinent question for patients with severe viral infections causing acute lung injury and ARDS (such as COVID-19 and influenza). It has been proposed that convalescent serum be given during the acute lung injury phase, but if this leads to activation of Fc receptor-bearing MCs, it could be detrimental (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2020) .",

Fc receptor-mediated uptake can divert antigens to a more acidic endosomal compartment conducive to MHCII antigen processing. Mouse IgG2c-antigen IC injection in vivo led to rapid Fc receptor-mediated internalization of antigen in inf-cDC2s. More mechanistic studies are needed, but this ligand-induced internalization could be one of the main reasons why these cells have been ignored as major players in the uptake of ICs in vivo, a function that has traditionally been attributed to cDC1 in the steady state but could be an induced function on inf-cDC2s (den Haan and Bevan, 2002) .",

Preprocessing Data Preprocessing of the data was done by the scran and scater R package according to workflow proposed by the Marioni lab (Lun et al., 2016) . Outlier cells were identified based on 3 metrics (library size, number of expressed genes and mitochondrial proportion) and cells were tagged as outliers when they were 3 median absolute deviation (MADs) away from the median value of each metric across all cells. Detecting highly variable genes, finding clusters and creating tSNE plots was done using the Seurat pipeline. Marker genes per identified subpopulation were found using the findMarker function of the Seurat pipeline. Additional low quality (low UMI counts, high % of mitochondrial genes) and contaminating cells (potential doublets, lymphocytes, non-immune cells) were also removed from the analysis ( Figure S4A ). Single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering using SCENIC We performed SCENIC (Aibar et al., 2017) by starting from the raw counts and following the proposed workflow using the default parameters. The co-expression network was generated using GENIE3 rather than GRNBoost2. AUC, which identifies and scores gene regulatory networks or regulons in single cells, was calculated using AUCell as previously described (Aibar et al., 2017) . The better the targets of a regulon match the highly expressed genes of a certain cell, the higher the AUC value of that regulon in that particular cell.",
