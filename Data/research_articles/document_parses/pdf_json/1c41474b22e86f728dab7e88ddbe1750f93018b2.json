Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. We hypothesize that low sodium status makes renal involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys.

If SARS-CoV-2 becomes systemic after the respiratory system has served as porte d'entr\u00e9e, the kidney is a potential target for the virus, which is supported by results of RNAsequencing studies, which found up to 100 times higher tissue ACE2 expression in the kidneys compared to the lungs 4 .

Concordantly, Berger et al. demonstrated a nearly 5-fold higher ACE2 expression in spontaneously hypertensive rats fed a low sodium diet when compared to those on a high sodium diet 6 . It should be noted that the high sodium group in the study by Cao et al. was exposed to a 20-times higher sodium intake than the low sodium group 5 , while such an extreme difference in sodium intake is rarely seen between humans. Moreover, these experimental studies did not differentiate between cell membrane bound ACE2 and soluble ACE2, which may be important in light of SARS-CoV-2 exposure to cells. Soluble ACE2 is formed through proteolytic cleavage of membrane bound ACE2 but probably represents only a small fraction of membrane bound ACE2 7 . It has been proposed that low sodium balance may lead to more severe COVID-19 8 . Indeed, studies on electrolyte disturbances during COVID-19 have shown significantly lower sodium concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 infection 9 . Here, we hypothesize that low sodium status also makes renal involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys. The hypothesized interaction between sodium balance, the ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2, and the kidney is shown in Figure 1 . We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections and low sodium intake be treated early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.
