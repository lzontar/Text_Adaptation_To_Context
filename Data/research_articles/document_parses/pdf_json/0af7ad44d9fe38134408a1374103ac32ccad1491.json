To detect IAV M2, mouse monoclonal antibody clone 14/C2 (Abcam) was used. To detect IAV NP, either monoclonal AA5H (Abcam) or a rabbit polyclonal serum raised against whole NP (A2915) (Noton et al., 2007) were used. To stain the surface of virus infected cells, a rabbit polyclonal serum raised against whole PR8 virions was used (Amorim et al., 2007) .

For TEM immunogold labeling, appropriately transduced HCT116 cells were grown on glass bottom petri dishes (MatTek) and infected at an MOI of 5. 16 hours after infection, cellswere fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were permeabilised and incubated with rabbit anti-GFP antiserum then incubated with goat anti rabbit ultrasmall gold (Aurion 100.011) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After silver enhancement and fixation with osmium tetroxide, cells were dehydrated and embedded in resin. Ultrathin sections were examined using a Philips 208 EM operated at 80kV. For SEM visualization of viral filaments, cells were fixed, rinsed and treated with 2% uranyl acetate. They were dehydrated, then glued to SEM stubs with colloidal silver. The stubs were coated with 10nm of gold and viewed in an FEL-Philips XL30 FEGSEM at 5kv.A549 cells expressing GFP-LC3 were transfected with siRNAs specific to ATG16L1 (GGCUCUGCUGAGGGCUCUCUGUAUA)(Muhlinen et al., 2012), FIP200 (CAGUAAUGGCCAAGAUUCCACUGUU) or a non-targeting control (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 on both day 1 and day 3. Cells were then either infected or starved by transfer to EBSS media for one hour on day",
