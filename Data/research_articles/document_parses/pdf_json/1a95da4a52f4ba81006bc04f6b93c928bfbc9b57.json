This aspect may not immediately appear to be a priority in an organizational model, but BM patients are known to be very fragile and at risk of skeletal complications defined as skeletal-related events (SREs) (4) .",

More than 3348 patients were screened with our software. Of those with a diagnosis of BM from different primitive tumors (Fig.1) , 37 from several geographic areas underwent multidisciplinary teleconsultations to evaluate the risk of SREs ( Table 1) In conclusion patients with BM are susceptible to frequent complications and a multidisciplinary approach is has proven highly effective in dealing with them.",

Furthermore, in Italy a high proportion of patients travel from one region to another for healthcare, increasing the risk of spreading the virus.
