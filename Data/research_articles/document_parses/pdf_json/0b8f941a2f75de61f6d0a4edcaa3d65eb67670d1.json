Since the supply airflow rate is set to 9.4L/(s\u00b7person) in the experiment (Cao et al. 2014) , the inlet velocity is defined as 1.478 m/s. The periodic condition is implemented on the boundaries perpendicular to X m -axis. The wall adjacent to the velocity inlet is set as no-slip wall and the other boundaries are set as pressure outlet.

For that purpose, we first obtain the steady flow using the standard k-\u03b5 model with the modified dissipation coefficients. From the flow field, affected by the human plume from the three passengers, the highest thermal plume emerges at region around the middle passenger in each side (where, x = \u00b1 0.702 m); the forced convection region is at the middle of the aisle ( x = 0 m) under the influence of the air supply jets from each side.
