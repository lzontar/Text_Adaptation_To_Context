            "text": "detrimental effects of inhibiting antiviral immunity, thereby delaying virus clearance and perpetuating illness. Accordingly, findings from multiple studies in humans and animals indicate that corticosteroid immunosuppression (both inhaled and systemic) impairs induction of anti-viral type-I interferon responses to a range of respiratory viruses, 3, 4 effects that are likely to also occur in the context of COVID-19. Selective therapies with JAK inhibitors could be expected to have similar effects. JAK-STAT signalling is a major component of the type-I interferon pathway. 3 Tofacitinib has been shown to inhibit interferon-\u03b1 production in vitro. 5 Suppression of interferon or other mediators (eg, interleukin 6) could also promote secondary bacterial infection and further complicate the disease course. 3 The decision to pharmacologically immunosuppress a critically unwell patient with COVID-19 remains a difficult one. Possible beneficial effects of reducing inflammation should be carefully weighed up against the potential for deleterious impairment of anti-microbial immunity.",

This strategic approach, which has produced unquestionable benefits, consists of treating every person, infected or not, living in a defined geographical area at approximately the same time. 1 In 2017, more than 1\u00b77 billion treatments (mainly albendazole, mebendazole, iver mec tin, azithromycin, and praziquantel) were delivered to 1\u00b704 billion individuals. 2 This chemopreventive strategy is not limited to neglected tropical diseases, but rather is also applied to other important diseases such as falciparum malaria. 3 Pollution caused by pharmaceuticals is an emerging concern, with well documented evidence of risks to the environment and even to human health. According to one study, ivermectin-a drug for which millions of doses have been used in mass drug administration programmes to treat onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis-disrupts dung beetle diversity, soil properties, and ecosystem func tioning. 4 Another example is diseases; actually, one of the earliest and most devastating examples of how strangers can bring an infective threat was the spread of smallpox by European pioneers, decimating Native American populations. Yet in many contemporary cases, this risk is distorted with political purposes by authoritarian forces. Unfortunately, the message authoritarian forces are delivering is very effective. As Murray and colleagues 9 have shown, in countries with poorer hygienic conditions, disgust for the foreigner and the worst-off among the population is an important driver for support to authoritarian governments.",
