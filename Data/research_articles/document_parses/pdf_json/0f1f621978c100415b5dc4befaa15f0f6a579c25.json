Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2 months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/ immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients.",

Among the various existing medical disciplines, the pandemic has significantly changed the current practice in treating neuromuscular disorders. These diseases constitute a group of very heterogeneous conditions, most often of genetic or autoimmune origin, which affect both children and adults to a degree that varies widely from one individual to another. They include muscle disorders (e.g., muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, metabolic myopathies, inflammatory myopathies, and muscle channelopathies), diseases of the neuromuscular junction (e.g., either acquired or congenital myasthenic syndromes), peripheral nerve disorders (e.g., dysimmune neuropathies, familial amyloid neuropathies, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), and spinal muscular atrophies. In France, 40,000-50,000 patients are thought to suffer from neuromuscular diseases. A significant number of these patients display great disability and may have cardiac and/or respiratory impairments. Of concern for this report, this number excludes those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; although also included under the umbrella of neuromuscular disorders, the herein proposed guidance will not cover this condition.",

It is therefore essential to develop a preventive approach. This involves the supply of easily intelligible information to this patient population, the content of which must be updated as the knowledge progresses and widely disseminated. As patients demand information to keep themselves informed and safe and to homogenize the answers at the national level, a frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled from the questions most frequently asked of the secretariats at reference centers; the coordinator nurses; and the regional offices of the AFM-Telethon, French neuromuscular patient association. The main addressed topics pertain to the disease itself, its mode of transmission, the official national public health recommendations to prevent it, the behaviors to adopt in case symptoms appear, and its consequences specific to the neuromuscular patient (e.g., relating to the management of steroids and immunosuppressor treatments, medical appointments, rehabilitation, and 6 ventilation). The constant evolution of both available knowledge and official instructions have made it necessary to continuously update the FAQ content. Achieving the widest possible dissemination is necessary for this type of action to be effective. This FAQ sheet is therefore available on the FILNEMUS website (www.filnemus.fr), and its dissemination is ensured by the neuromuscular reference centers and the AFM-Telethon in particular, thanks to the offering of backup and advice hotlines by the reference centers or the regional offices of the AFM-Telethon. In addition to fulfilling the mission of disseminating information, these hotlines offer a way to connect with patients and identify risky situations such as those involving the loss of human aid, isolation, disruption of care, or psychological distress. The reference center should therefore ensure that patients have received relevant information and adequate equipment.",

Treatment with these enzyme replacement therapies, often administered during daily hospitalization, has been discontinued in most cases since the beginning of the epidemic to limit the risk of patients with Pompe disease contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital, especially since most patients with Pompe disease have respiratory insufficiency related to diaphragmatic involvement. Stopping enzyme replacement therapy over a period of 1 to 3 months is unlikely to lead to a significant worsening of the disease, although there are few data available in the medical literature with which to accurately estimate the risk of worsening the disease after a relatively short interruption of treatment. A Swiss study of seven patients with Pompe disease whose treatment was interrupted for economic reasons [10] showed clear deteriorations of motor and respiratory functions and no complete recovery following the resumption of treatment [11] .

Currently, data about the effects of other treatments remain very sparse; nevertheless, the first results from the Italian experience are demonstrative. Out of a cohort of 320 patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases treated by biotherapies or JAK inhibitors, eight patients had a COVID-19 infection either confirmed or strongly suspected [22] . In all cases, the authors reported that they suspended the treatments during the infection and resumed them after a \"transient\" discontinuation. Any discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy should be discussed with the referral center following the patient. As in the experience of infectious events, particularly bacterial events under biotherapy, the resumption of immunosuppressant therapy should be discussed 1 to 2 weeks after the absence of any symptoms, i.e., a total cessation of around 3 to 4 weeks from the start of COVID-19 infection. Azathioprine cannot be crushed and then cannot be administered if the patient is tube-fed. In this case and if the decision to maintain immunosuppression is made, a switch to mycophenolate mofetil syrup can be an option to consider. Finally, biotherapies such as tocilizumab are promising candidates for the treatment of the cytokine storm responsible for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome [23] .",

This concern arose from the observation that the virus binds to ACE2 to infect cells and the fact that ACE2 levels are increased in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs. However, there are currently no data proving a causal relationship between ACE2 activity and COVID-19-associated mortality [24] . Some findings from preclinical studies even suggest a possible protective role of ARB in COVID-19associated lung injury [25] . It has been well documented that the abrupt withdrawal of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in high risk patients, including those with cardiac dysfunction, may result in further clinical instability and adverse health outcomes. Thus, patients who are at risk for, being evaluated for, or who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 should continue with their usual cardiac treatments, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs [26] .",

These treatments are also contraindicated in congenital myasthenia gravis [28] . However, if the patient is intubated and ventilated, these antibiotics can be used in the absence of alternative therapy. It should be kept in mind that the worsening or flare-up of myasthenia gravis usually occurs within days of the administration of the contraindicated antibiotic treatment, but flare-ups may occur later on up to 29 days after the initiation of treatment [29] . In the absence of a demonstrated benefit from hydroxychloroquine and given that an exacerbation of myasthenia gravis may be caused by this molecule, although reports are contradictory [30, 31] , the FILNEMUS network does not recommend their use in myasthenic patients with COVID-19 infection at the time of writing.",

However, some patients with neuromuscular diseases use NIV chronically. If a patient has to use NIV, the use of a single circuit with a mask leak is contraindicated because of the aerosolization caused by the system. However, measures to adapt the circuit and the use of NIV make it possible to limit aerosolization and continue using NIV. Before starting or stopping NIV, the patient's mask must be in place, and personal protective equipment must be worn by caregivers [40] . The mask should be sealed as tightly as possible, involving a full face mask, perhaps with a temporary 16 lowering of the pressure if the leakage is too great, and an anti-bacterial filter should be used at the ventilator outlet on the inspiratory circuit and after the mask [41] . Oxygen therapy can be added to the NIV if necessary. For patients with contraindications to resuscitation, we recommend that the local palliative care team be consulted. Some neuromuscular patients have written advance directives, including whether or not they wish to be intubated in the event of respiratory distress. Emergency medical teams are reminded of the importance of checking with the patient's family and friends or referring physicians beforehand, if possible, to find out whether any advance directives have been drawn up. The regional services of the AFM-Telethon in their emergency kit updated during the COVID-19 period remind the patient of the importance of keeping these advance directives with them in the case of emergency.",
