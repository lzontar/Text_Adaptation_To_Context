The onset of pandemic influenza viruses might be attributed to various ambient meteorological factors including temperature, relative humidity (Rh), and PM 1 concentrations, etc. The study aims to explore the correlation between the seasonality of pandemic influenza and these factors. Methods: We recruited pediatric patients aged from 0 to 18 years who were diagnosed with influenza A or B from in Shanghai Children's Medical Centre (SCMC). Ambient meteorological data were collected from the Shanghai Meteorological Service (SMS) over the same period. The correlation of influenza outbreak and meteorological factors were analyzed through preliminary Pearson's r correlation test and subsequent time-series Poisson regression analysis using the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). Results: Pearson's r test showed a statistically significant correlation between the weekly number of influenza A outpatients and ambient meteorological factors including weekly mean, maximum, minimum temperature and barometric pressure (P < 0.001), and PM 1 (P < 0.01). While the weekly number of influenza B outpatients was statistically significantly correlated with weekly mean, maximum and minimum temperature (P < 0.001), barometric pressure and PM 1 (P < 0.01), and minimum Rh (P < 0.05). Mean temperature and PM 1 were demonstrated to be the statistically significant variables in the DLNM with influenza A and B outpatients through time-series Poisson regression analysis. A U-shaped curve relationship was noted between the mean temperature and influenza A cases (below 15\u00b0C and above 20\u00b0C), and the risks increased for influenza B with mean temperature below 10\u00b0C. PM 1 posed a risk after a concentration of 23 ppm for both influenza A and B.

Three to five million severe influenza-related illness is reported annually, leading to 250,000-500,000 deaths each year, affecting 20-30% of children and 5-10% of adults worldwide [16, 29, 34] .

A time-series study comparing the incidence of influenza to three climatic parameters including the mean temperature, Rh, and rainfall, in five different cities found an association between the Rh and the incidence of influenza A, and a key association between the mean temperature and the incidence of influenza, in most cities [31] . This corresponded with another study, which showed similar results on the dependence of the dynamics of influenza transmission (or pathology) on temperature and Rh under controlled experimental conditions [19] . Another study indicated that specific humidity plays a significant role in the seasonal transmission of influenza viruses, with two types of environmental conditions, \"cold-dry\" and \"humid-rainy,\" being identified as associated with seasonal influenza [30] . However, the relationships between the incidence of influenza and more ambient meteorological factors such as accumulative precipitation, barometric pressure, wind speed and PM 1 concentrations remained to be elucidated. These factors, together with temperature and Rh, are the most common and standard parameters for measuring atmosphere and climate by the meteorological instrumentation. Barometric pressure is strongly associated with temperature as a low temperature usually indicates high-pressure zone and vice versa. Seasonal variation of wind speed and aerosol concentrations like PM 1 may influence the influenza seasonality. Specifically, wind dispersion (of the atmospheric aerosols) and the transport by ambient fine particulate matter may significantly affect transmission and concentrations of the airborne influenza virus, and hence increases the exposure risk of the population to the virus [7, 11] . Shanghai features a subtropical monsoon system with higher wind speeds in early spring and autumn, a low subtropical pressure system in summer and a high-pressure system in winter. In this highly polluted city, a high level of atmospheric particulate matter pollution is much more commonly observed in late autumn and winter than summer. It is therefore worthy to investigate how the ambient climate conditions correlate with the influenza seasonality in Shanghai, thereby providing more insights into the interactions between influenza and future climate change.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 491, "end": 495, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 703, "end": 707, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 962, "end": 966, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1879, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1883, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This study focused on establishing the relationship between the seasonality of pediatric pandemic influenza (A and B) and ambient meteorological factors.

There was a response lag to the outbreak of influenza B in 2019 winter as delayed to March-May due to differences in antigenic changes and transmission rates between influenza types A and B [1, 33] .

Hence, ambient temperature (mean, maximum and minimum) was closely related to the seasonality of pediatric pandemic influenza A and B [15] . Barometric pressure and PM 1 concentrations exhibited a weak positive correlation with the weekly number of pediatric influenza A and B outpatients (with the addition of weak negative correlation from between the weekly number of influenza B outpatients and corresponding weekly mean minimum Rh). The barometric pressure was highly negatively correlated with mean, maximum and minimum temperature, as shown by their respective Pearson's r correlation coefficients-(0.92, \u2212 0.92 and \u2212 0.91), which plays a vital role in the spread and transmission of influenza viruses [15] . Other studies also reported the positive correlation between the number of pediatric influenza outpatients and pollutant levels including PM 2.5 , PM 10 and O 3 concentrations as the pollutants could affect the spread of viruses [7, 35] , but they did not mention the relationship between PM 1 concentrations and pediatric influenza incidence, suggesting a potential research deficit on the aspect. Moreover, influenza seasonality was highly associated with minimum Rh [15, 25, 30, 33] as proved by a negative correlation with the number of influenza B outpatients which supports the findings from one study conducted in Beijing [3] . However, the negative correlation contradicts with findings from other studies as minimum Rh was regarded positively correlated with influenza infections [15] due to loss of infectivity under low minimum Rh [10, 11, 15, 23] . Overall, the correlation coefficients between the number of pediatric influenza B outpatients and ambient meteorological factors (Table. 4 ) were lower and less distinct (or discernible) than the case of influenza A (Table. 3) due to difference in virologic basis including the accumulation of surface antigenic changes and transmission rates [1, 33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 282, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 283, "end": 286, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 287, "end": 290, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 291, "end": 294, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 295, "end": 298, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 439, "end": 443, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1018, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1253, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1257, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1494, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1498, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1502, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1506, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1650, "end": 1653, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1810, "end": 1814, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1863, "end": 1867, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1871, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1872, "end": 1875, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1879, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2228, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2229, "end": 2232, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2011, "end": 2020, "text": "(Table. 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2105, "text": "(Table.", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results and findings from the DLNMs also confirmed that the influenza seasonality was attributed to the effects of ambient meteorological factors including mean temperature and PM 1. Specifically, we found both lower (below 5\u00b0C) and higher temperature (above 25-30\u00b0C) (a U-shaped curve relationship) were strongly associated with a higher incidence of pediatric influenza A, which corresponds to two previous studies [5, 33] . One study conducted in Jiangsu province, China, which is also a temperate region, indicated influenza A peaked at \u2212 4\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C respectively [5] . Another study conducted in two subtropical regions and one temperate region including Shanghai, Hong Kong, and British Columbia respectively found a similar consistent relationship with influenza incidence peak at low and high temperature in all three regions [33] . A negative relationship between mean temperature and pediatric influenza B incidence was observed as the RR increased significantly below 5\u00b0C, which is consistent with other previous studies [5, 9, 20, 22, 28] . One study in Jiangsu explicitly linked the mean temperature to the occurrence of influenza B by indicating a peak in pediatric influenza B incidence at 5\u00b0C [5] . Other studies from Guangzhou (a subtropical region in SE China) and Seoul (a temperate region in Korea) reported similar findings that there was a significant increase in influenza incidence below 20\u00b0C and 0-5\u00b0C respectively [9, 22] , along with a study using a guinea pig model which also explored a link between an increase in influenza transmission rate and temperature below 5\u00b0C [20] . However, no relationship was found in the high-temperature range in these studies [9, 20, 22, 28] , except the one in Jiangsu [5] . Apart from mean temperature, we also found a significant increase in PM 1 concentrations higher than 23 ppm, which is particularly prevalent in winter. Due to limited literature on the non-linear and delayed exposure-response relationship between PM 1 concentrations and pediatric influenza incidence, we have not yet found supports of this finding from other studies. Regarding the cumulative extreme effects at 0-7 lag days, we found the cumulative RRs were significantly higher in the relationship Overall, these findings provided a useful insight into the seasonal influenza in relation to the current atmospheric setting which is highly uncertain given what the future climate change can hold. There have been several prior research studies investigating the relationship between climate change and the frequency of seasonal influenza onset [2, 4, 32] , but only one research indicated a higher likelihood of an early onset of severe seasonal influenza pandemics (commonly known as the flu seasons) for both influenza A and B following warmer than average winters due to larger fraction of susceptible populations being left in the face of a potential outbreak in the next colder season than during normalcy [32] . This specific finding corroborated with one of ours that pediatric influenza patients were more susceptible during winter when the temperature is low, suggested a winter epidemic among children. In the realm of climate change and global warming, it could be anticipated that more severe flu seasons would occur given the increasing frequency of 'warmer' winters. Other studies were still uncertain on the exact and more detailed effects of climate change on the seasonality influenza pandemics [2, 4] . Hence, it is certain that the current findings from this study will change in future 'climate change' scenario but uncertain regarding the process of changes that would occur given the rising frequency of anthropogenic climate change and associated global warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 425, "end": 428, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 573, "end": 576, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 839, "end": 843, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1040, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1043, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1047, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1051, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1055, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1217, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1448, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1452, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1607, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1692, "end": 1695, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1699, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1700, "end": 1703, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1707, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1739, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2588, "end": 2591, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2592, "end": 2594, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2595, "end": 2598, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2955, "end": 2959, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3456, "end": 3459, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3460, "end": 3462, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study suggested that mean temperature and PM 1 were continually associated with the seasonality of pediatric pandemic influenza A and B and recurring in the transmission and spread of influenza viruses.
