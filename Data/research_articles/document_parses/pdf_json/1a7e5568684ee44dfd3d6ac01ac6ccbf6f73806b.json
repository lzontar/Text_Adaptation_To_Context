The high margin of viral safety can be attributed to a number of measures that manufacturers have implemented during the last decade. These measures are part of a multifaceted strategy for pathogen safety that includes donor screening, donation testing, virus inactivation or removal measures during manufacture, strict adherence to good manufacturing procedures and post-use surveillance of products.
