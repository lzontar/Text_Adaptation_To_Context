Serious outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 , related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, have occurred throughout China and the world. Therefore, we intend to shed light on its potential clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 50 confirmed fatal cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported on Chinese official media networks from January 16, 2020, to February 5, 2020. All the cases were confirmed by local qualified medical and health institutions. Specific information has been released through official channels. According to the contents of the reports, we recorded in detail the gender, age, first symptom date, death date, primary symptoms, chronic fundamental diseases, and other data of the patients, and carried out analyses and discussion. Results: In total, 50 fatal cases were reported: median age was 70 y old, and males were 2.33 times more likely to die than females. The median number of days from the first symptom to death was 13, and that length of time tended to be shorter among people aged 65 and older compared with those younger than 65 (12 days vs 17 days; P = 0.046). Therefore, the older patients had fewer number of days from the first symptom to death (r = -0.40; P = 0.012). Conclusions: In our study, we found that most of the deaths were elderly men with chronic fundamental diseases, and their COVID-19 progression to death time was shorter. At the same time, we demonstrated that older men are more likely to become infected with COVID-19, and the risk of death is positively correlated with age.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "S ince December 2019, an infectious disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 1 has spread from Wuhan to other parts of China, also to other countries. 2 On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as \"coronavirus disease 2019\" or \"COVID-19.\" 3 In the early stages of the disease, patients show severe acute respiratory infection symptoms.

[21] [22] [23] The main symptoms of fever, cough, respiratory discomfort, and a small proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms, were consistent with symptoms in patients with SARS and MERS. 22, 24 Our results showed that the clinical features of COVID-19 were similar to those of the previous epidemic's coronavirus pneumonia and that it is more likely to infect older men with chronic comorbidities, as a result of the weak immune function of these patients and stronger immune response in females caused by the additional X chromosome. 22, 23, 25 At the time of this writing, compared with SARS (9.2%) 26 and MERS (34.4%), 6 the mortality rate of COVID-19 is not as high, but the speed of transmission is faster, the infection is stronger, and the number of infected persons is higher. Therefore, we still need to be vigilant against this disease. We counted the number of days from the first symptom to death of 40 cases. The median survival time (in days) from onset to death was 13, the same as reported by Wang et al. 18 Also, using single-factor analysis, we found that age was the key factor. Our study demonstrated that the time from the first symptom to death in the elderly (age > 65 y) was shorter than that of younger people (age \u2264 65 y), which is similar to that reported for MERS and SARS. 27, 28 On the other hand, other studies of patients with MERS found that patients with certain chronic diseases were more likely to die. [21] [22] [23] However, our single-factor study did not find that these factors had statistical significance for the time. It may be that the sample size was too small. We suspect that people with these chronic diseases are more likely to become infected with COVID-19, but not to die. It also indirectly proves that this disease has a widespread, high infection rate, but low mortality compared with MERS and SARS.
