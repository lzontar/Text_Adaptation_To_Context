The sensitivity of the value of \ue23e 0 to changes in any of the parameter values involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation strategies are investigated using the proposed model and it is observed that the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may play the major role in the re-emergence of the disease in the future.

However, there are several challenges to the use of mathematical models in providing nearly accurate predictions at an early stage of the outbreak, particularly in real time as it is difficult to determine many of the pathogen-based parameters through mathematical models. The estimation of such parameters will require clinical observations and \"shoe-leather\" epidemiology [31] . It is also possible for some of the parameters to be verified through observation only at a later stage in the course of the epidemic.

As soon as the virus enters the body (either through the mouth, nose or membrane of the eyes), it finds its way to the windpipe and then the lungs. This viral attack is characterised by flu like symptoms, fever (body temperatures more than 38.3 \u2022 C) and dry cough at the initial stage of the infection. Once the virus gets into the lungs, it causes fibrosis of the lungs leading to shortness of breath (or difficulty to breathe) and severe pneumonia followed by impaired functioning of the liver and acute kidney injury [20] . The virus is then released from the infected individual when they cough, sneeze and when they touch their own nose or mouth. Some particles that are released through coughing or sneezing may land on clothing of other people in close proximity, and surfaces around them while some of the smaller particles can remain in the air for some time. In addition, some scientific evidence shows that the virus can also be shed for a longer time in faecal matter [49] . The virus survives on surfaces, fabrics, metals, plastics for variable times. Recent reports indicate that the virus can survive from a shorter time (in the air) up to 2-3 days long on plastic and stainless-steel surfaces [43] . This implies that an uninfected individual can also acquire the virus through contact with infected surfaces. That means, there is a possibility for COVID-19 infection to spread from such contaminated surfaces and objects to uninfected humans. Hence, including the proportion of indirect transmission from the environment in the mathematical model structure is important to address this situation.

In particular, the people in some parts of Asia have fully embraced the measures while many in other parts of the world were very much hesitant to use them. For example, wearing a face mask everyday in public appearances is like a ritual in most of the countries in Southeast Asia, while the same is considered as a bad gesture in many of the other parts of the world [50] (even if it is now becoming a \"new normal\" also everywhere in the globe). One key difference between these societies and the people in the West is that, the communities in the Southeast Asia have experienced similar disease outbreaks before and the memories are still fresh and painful [50] . That means, recent history of a similar event plays a role in behavioural change of the population especially at the beginning of the outbreak in addition to the perceived threat from the disease.

However, this may not necessarily be the case since immunity of individuals is affected by a number of factors, including age, cortisol levels and nutrition among others. The impact of differentiated levels of immunity on the disease dynamics and potential resurgence of the epidemic can be explored in the future when relevant data becomes available. Our model did not include the possibility of vaccination or treatment. We, however acknowledge their importance in controlling the infection. Therefore, optimal control of the infection in the presence of these mitigation strategies can be explored in future works when relevant data becomes available. Since the disease has been observed to affect age groups differently, it is plausible to consider age-structured models to better understand the effect of the disease in the respective age groups.

In this scenario, it is assumed that the interventions described in Case 2 started half way through the time that Phase 2 was implemented in Case 2. That means, the implementation of the interventions described in the four phases of Case 2 is assumed to be followed, but the length of the time in Phases 1 and 2 is reduced as described below. Otherwise, all the details of the interventions in Case 2 are kept the same. The time profile for this set of interventions is given in Figure 8 . The general behaviour of the graph in Figure 8 is the same as that of Figure  7 . However, this strategy has an advantage in significantly reducing the height of the first peak. The height of the subsequent peaks are found to be the same unless some additional measures are taken after Phase 3.Unfortunately, the strategies in both of the above two scenarios (Case 2 and Case 3) do not help to fully contain the disease once it spreads in the population. As it can be seen from Figures 7 and 8 , another wave of outbreaks of the disease emerge at a later stage. Here, we can see that the asymptomatic infectious individuals play the greater role in becoming the major source for the second wave. Therefore, if there is a possibility to track and detect people with asymptomatic infection, and if they can be effectively quarantined for the required period of time, then there is a possibility for the disease to be contained. As it can be observed from Figure 9 , if we can increase the rate of detecting and quarantining the asymptomatic individuals to a proportion of about 30%, it is Appendix A. Proof of Theorem 3.1The proof of Theorem 3.1 is outlined here below based on the following two steps. First, we show that all solutions of Eq.(2) are nonnegative as required in [3, 41] . To show that the state variables and of the model are positive for all \u2265 0, we use proof by contradiction. We suppose that a trajectory crosses one of the positive cones at times 1 or 2 such that:Using the first equation of Eq. (2), the first assumption leads towhich contradicts the first assumption that \u2032 ( 1 ) < 0. Thus, ( ) remains positive for all \u2265 0. Here, 1 is chosen so that our point to be on the positive axis of ( ) so that ( 1 ) is positive.Using the second equation of Eq. (2), \u2032 ( 2 ) = \u210e + + > 0, which also contradicts the assumption \u2032 ( 2 ) < 0. Hence, ( ) remains positive for all \u2265 0. Based on the third equation of Eq.
