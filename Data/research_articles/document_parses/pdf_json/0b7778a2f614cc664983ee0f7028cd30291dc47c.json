In recent years, many existing works have been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task, particularly recurrent neural networks based methods, e.g., Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). However, DKT has the problem of vibration in prediction outputs. In this paper, to better understand the problem of DKT, we utilize a mathematical computation model named Finite State Automaton(FSA), which can change from one state to another in response to the external input, to interpret the hidden state transition of the DKT when receiving inputs. And we discover the root cause of the two problems is that the DKT can not handle the long sequence input with the help of FSA. Accordingly, we propose an effective attentionbased model, which can solve the above problem by directly capturing the relationships among each item of the input regardless of the length of the input sequence. The experimental results show that our proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on several well-known corpora.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "With the development of modern technologies, online platforms for intelligent tutoring systems(ITS) and massive open online courses are becoming more and more prevalent.

When an input item was accepted by the FSA, it represents that this item has a positive effect on the final prediction outputs of the model, and vice versa. We display the acceptance rate of every input sequence in Fig. 1 . We can draw the conclusion from Fig. 1 that the longer the input sequence, the higher the proportion of rejected items, and the lower prediction accuracy. This phenomenon is consistent with the description in [7] , who points out that LSTM [2] has the weakness of capturing feature when the input sequence is too long.

Moreover, we notice that on Simulated-5 dataset, the performance of our model is not very impressive. One reason is that there is no long sequence in the dataset.
