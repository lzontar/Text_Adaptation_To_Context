To date, two different handles with a curved profile have been produced. Door openers were printed using FDM devices (J120, J170 and J370). Layer thickness was 0.33 mm, with a filling density of 43% and a wall thickness of 2 mm (Figure 3). The support angle was calibrated to 30\u00b0 to avoid excessive amount of material. On average, 5 pairs of door openers (left and right) were printed in 22h for the design with clips and in 17 hours for the design with cable ties; printing position was optimized in order to obtain the surface quality [8] (Figure 4). The 15 th of May 2020, after 45 days of activity, around 750 clipped door handles had been dispatched to three APHP hospitals -150 for Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatriere University Hospital, Paris, 200 for Necker -Enfants Malades University Hospital, Paris and 400 for Beaujon University Hospital, Clichy. Over 1600 devices with cable ties had also been dispatched in various hospitals, schools, and research institutions -900 for Imagine Institute, Paris, 165 for \u00c9cole \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de l'Arbal\u00e8te, Paris, 65 for Ecole \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire publique Saint-Jacques (two state elementary schools), 400 for AGEPS and 80 for University of Paris) (Figure 5).",
