Developed in 1991, due to its principle, GCxGC offers a much better capacity of separation and a better sensitivity than conventional gas chromatography. Thanks to the sensitivity of GCxGC (three-to fivefold higher than GC) some compounds can be detected at the ng/L level. Semard et al.

A large range of drugs (antidepressors, antibiotics, anticoagulants\u2026), personal care products (sunscreens, antiseptics, cosmetics\u2026) and carcinogen compounds were found in the raw waste water samples. In addition to the above mentioned micropollutants, a wide variety of nitrogen aliphatic and aromatic structures that could act as DBP (disinfection by-products) precursors, were also uncovered.

Their objectives in sample preparation are to increase the concentration of the target organisms to the practical operating range of a given PCR assay; and to produce a purified DNA extract that would be representative of the initial water sample and would be free of PCR-inhibitory substances.
