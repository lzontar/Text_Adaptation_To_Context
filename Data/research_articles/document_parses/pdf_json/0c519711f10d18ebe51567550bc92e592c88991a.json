The pharmacists' 27 support is crucial for the patients in reducing their risk of developing acute complications and 28 associated hospital admissions. The majority of clinical guidelines endorse metformin as a first choice antidiabetic due to its 44 efficacy, lower hypoglycemia risk, and medication-induced weight loss. 7 Nevertheless, the Gliclazide is known to be associated with the risk of hypoglycemia, particularly in case of 54 poor appetite, so a dose reduction should be considered. 6 However, as hyperglycemia is more with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, recent evidence from a meta-analysis did 96 not support any increased risk among patients with type 2 diabetes. 16 Nevertheless, patients 97 should be adequately educated to recognize the associated symptoms that are also 98 overlapping with DKA clinical presentation. 4 As such, if DKA or pancreatitis is suspected, 99 this medication should be discontinued, and patients should be referred to seek medical 100 consultation.
