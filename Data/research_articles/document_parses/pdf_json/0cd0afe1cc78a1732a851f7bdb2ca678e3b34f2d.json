By 26 April 2020, more than 2.9 million people were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and over 203 thousand people lost their life globally. By 26 April 2020, 107773 confirmed cases were reported in Turkey with 2706 deaths. Majority of the cases in Turkey has been observed in Istanbul. In the world, the duration of availability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples [2]. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in wastewaters in Australia [3], Netherlands [4], USA [5], France [6], Spain [7] and USA [8] by using different virus concentration techniques. In this work, Istanbul metropole with 65 % of Covid-19 cases was chosen as the pilot city. On the 21st of April 2020, 24-hr composite samples were collected from the Ambarli, Pasakoy and Kadikoy wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). On the 25 th of April 2020, more wastewater samples were taken from Terkos, Buyukcekmece, Baltalimani and Tuzla WWTPs. These wastewater treatment plants were selected among 81 plants in Istanbul in order to take representative samples from 4 different districts of Istanbul according to the severity of Covid-19 cases, like very serious, serious, moderate and mild.
