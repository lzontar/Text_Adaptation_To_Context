Based on their systemic effects, such measures are extremely pervasive, as their impact on human rights is ubiquitous, 7 although (presented as) temporary, as they will presumably remain in force until the pandemic is sufficiently mitigated. Most likely, compliance with such measures will result in a dramatic liquidity crisis followed by an economic recession. These economic considerations may have played a role in inducing some countries to adopt less stringent measures than a generalised lockdown and the discontinuance of most business and industrial activities. 8 In any event, in all jurisdictions the issue arises as to the impact of COVID-19 on the ability of the parties to duly perform their contractual obligations. This circumstance is not confined to domestic settings, but extends to international business transactions, where the risks arising both from pandemics and from the subsequent PMRs are typically regulated through appropriate force majeure clauses. 9 However, unlike the corresponding national provisions regarding force majeure, which tend to exclude the party's liability for failure to perform, the above-mentioned clauses regulate the effects of force majeure events in several different fashions by offering the parties ways to preserve their contractual relationships. 10 This article offers a threefold analysis of force majeure clauses in light of PMRs. First, it proposes an overview of force majeure clauses and their effects. Second, it assesses the possible use of such clauses in relation to PMRs. Finally, it examines the possible extraterritorial reach of such PMRs.",

If the list is meant to be exhaustive, the absence of an express reference deprives the aggrieved party of the remedy. Several contracts, however, merely contain a general catch-all phrase referring to the requirements of force majeure mentioned above (or contain a merely illustrative list), thus leaving the question open as to whether the COVID-19 pandemic qualifies as a force majeure event under that specific contract. 12 11 Fontaine and De Ly, supra, note 9, 453-92. 12 Even if COVID-19 falls within the contractual notion of force majeure, other requirements must be met, namely a direct causal link between the pandemic and the non-performance (which must be \"due to\" the pandemic) 13 and the unavoidability of the effects of COVID-19 (or of subsequent PMRs), whereas it is debated whether the force majeure event must be unforeseeable. 14 In some of the few comparable circumstances (ie upon the occurrence of other epidemics), courts have been extremely reluctant to grant the remedy. 15 If all of these requirements are fulfilled and if the party affected by the impediment invokes force majeure in compliance with other contractual requirements (form, time limit), then the clause provides for a remedial scheme, which in most cases is based on the interplay of suspension of performance, exemption from liability for nonperformance and termination of contract.",

This is, however, a questionable assumption to be carefully weighed against the benefits stemming from termination of the contract, which allows the parties to go back to the market in a competitive environment and seek anew, under the newly changed circumstances, for the most wealth-maximising transaction, either with the prior or with a new contractual counterparty.

Therefore, in courts other than those of the state that enacted the PMRs, the measures would in most cases not be taken into consideration as overriding mandatory provisions, but could only operate as a relevant factual circumstance suitable to fulfil the requirements set in the relevant force majeure clause. 25 Accordingly, the party whose business activity is directly affected by PMRs may invoke the factum principis, if the clause so allows, but the party that could not procure components due to the lockdown of its supplier will most likely be held liable for breach of contract on the grounds that it could have avoided the shortage of components by stocking them in advance or ensuring an alternative source from a country where no similar PMRs applied.",
