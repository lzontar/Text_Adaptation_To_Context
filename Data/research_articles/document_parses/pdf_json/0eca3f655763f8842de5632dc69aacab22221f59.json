The discovery and characterization of BeiV from 19 common wild rodents and 3 common wild shrews like M. rutilus and S. murinus expanded the host range of BeiV, indicating other possible animal hosts than just R.norvegicus and R. rattus. In our J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study, 3 out of 4 families of Rodentia, including Cricetidae, Muridae, Sciuridae are positive, and the rest are Soricomorpha, indicating the natural occurrence and wide distribution of BeiV in Rodentia in China. In addition, we found that shrew was one of the predominant animals harboring BeiV, while neither of the two tested species of Mustelidae family was positive for BeiV. This result is limited by small sample size of Mustelidae family, which warrants further study to validate. Positive detection of BeiV from high variety of organs, including heart, liver, spleen, kidney and lung samples suggested that BeiV can cause systemic infection in animal hosts. Despite of no direct evidence of detecting BeiV from blood sample, it is likely that the virus can be present in the bloodstream and might be transmitted among rodents through aggressive contacts, or to vectors by blood-sucking. These results were also consistent with the previous findings suggesting that BeiV can be detected in kidney and spleen samples, but not from respiratory or anal swabs(Woo et al., 2016). In another survey to characterize the virome of rodents in China, no BeiV was detected either, when the pharyngeal and anal swabs were used for NGS metagenomic analysis(Wu et al., 2018).Our study indicated that BeiVs of small animal sources have previouslyunrecognized genome divergence. Paramyxoviruses are pleomorphic enveloped viruses possessing a linear, non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (NNS) genome. The entire genome length of the BeiV is 19,212 nucleotides, listed as the fourth largest among all known members of the Paramyxoviridae family Our findings indicate that BeiV contain well-defined lineages that circulate widely throughout the Mainland China within particular taxonomic groups of hosts. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses revealed genetic diversity was correlated with geographic origins and animal hosts, possibly indicating a long-term co-evolution between virus and hosts. Although having the largest sample size for the detection of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f BeiV, the study is not designed as a nation-wide surveillance, thus not all regions were surveyed in the current research.In summary, we found presence of BeiV in various species of wild small animals with wide geographic distribution in mainland China, indicating several well-defined BeiV lineages circulate widely within particular taxonomic groups of hosts. These findings extend the current knowledge on the known host and biogeographic range of BeiVs that had previously characterized. Although no evidence of human infection with BeiV can be determined at the current stage, the potential risks to humans and livestock cannot be ignored. Therefore further investigation is warranted to attain a more comprehensive understanding of BeiV, as well as other members in the family Paramyxoviridae.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": ".
