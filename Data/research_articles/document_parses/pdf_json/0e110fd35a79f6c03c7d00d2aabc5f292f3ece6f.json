Curriculum learning has recently been shown to improve neural models' effectiveness by sampling batches non-uniformly, going from easy to difficult instances during training. In the context of neural Information Retrieval (IR) curriculum learning has not been explored yet, and so it remains unclear (1) how to measure the difficulty of training instances and (2) how to transition from easy to difficult instances during training. To address both challenges and determine whether curriculum learning is beneficial for neural ranking models, we need large-scale datasets and a retrieval task that allows us to conduct a wide range of experiments. For this purpose, we resort to the task of conversation response ranking: ranking responses given the conversation history. In order to deal with challenge (1), we explore scoring functions to measure the difficulty of conversations based on different input spaces. To address challenge (2) we evaluate different pacing functions, which determine the velocity in which we go from easy to difficult instances. We find that, overall, by just intelligently sorting the training data (i.e., by performing curriculum learning) we can improve the retrieval effectiveness by up to 2% (The source code is available at https://github.com/Guzpenha/transformers cl.).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Curriculum Learning (CL) is motivated by the way humans teach complex concepts: teachers impose a certain order of the material during students' education.

Unlike traditional learning to rank (LTR) [24] approaches in which we manually define features for queries, documents and their interaction, neural ranking models learn features directly from the raw textual data. Neural ranking approaches can be roughly categorized into representation-focused [17, 38, 47] and interaction-focused [13, 48] . The former learns query and document representations separately and then computes the similarity between the representations.

Self-paced learning [22] simultaneously selects easy instances to focus on and updates the model parameters by solving a biconvex optimization problem. A seemingly contradictory set of approaches give more focus to difficult or more uncertain instances. In active learning [4, 6, 44] , the most uncertain instances with respect to the current classifier are employed for training. Similarly, hard example mining [39] focuses on difficult instances, measured by the model loss or magnitude of gradients for instance.
