They are endemic in many countries and have recently emerged in new regions, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV) in South-and Central America, the West Nile virus (WNV) in North America, and the Yellow fever virus (YFV) in Brazil and many African countries, highlighting the need for preparedness. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available to treat flavivirus infections. We have previously discovered a broad-spectrum antiviral compound, benzavir-2, with potent antiviral activity against both DNA-and RNA-viruses. Our purpose was to investigate the inhibitory activity of benzavir-2 against flaviviruses. We used a ZIKV ZsGreen-expressing vector, two lineages of wild-type ZIKV, and other medically important flaviviruses. Benzavir-2 inhibited ZIKV derived reporter gene expression with an EC 50 value of 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M. Furthermore, ZIKV plaque formation, progeny virus production, and viral RNA expression were strongly inhibited. In addition, 2.5 \u00b5M of benzavir-2 reduced infection in vitro in three to five orders of magnitude for five other flaviviruses: WNV, YFV, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus.

Based on the growth kinetics of rZIKV-ZsGreen and the sensitivity of the ZsGreen detection in the fluorescent intensity assay, the analysis of virus infection was performed 24 h postinfection, and a 2-h treatment scheme with benzavir-2 at a relatively high concentration (10 \u00b5M) was selected (Figure 5A). When benzavir-2 was added at 2-4 h post-infection (hpi), the inhibitory effect was most pronounced, while the binding and entry steps (0-2 h) were less affected. Addition of benzavir-2 at later time-points post-infection also showed less inhibition.
