These include protocols for production and measurement of antibodies (Chapter 2), immunofluorescence and cell sorting (Chapter 5), and measurement of lymphokines and their cellular receptors (Chapter 6). In addition, various animal-based methods relating to the purification of antibodies (Chapter 2), and other biochemical procedures (Chapter 8), also apply to human materials. In certain instances, such as in the measurement of lymphokine/cytokine production, particular mention is made of how the procedure can be modified for use in studies of humans.",

It begins with a procedure for obtaining whole mononuclear cells based on cell density (Ficoll-Hypaque gradient separation; UNIT 7.1) and continues with procedures to separate major cell populations (T cells, B cells, macrophages, and null cells) from mononuclear cells ). In addition, techniques for isolating subpopulations of T cells and B cells by a variety of techniques are also presented, including complement-mediated lysis to \"kill\" unwanted (contaminating) cells, panning procedures in which cells are selectively bound via antibody to a plastic surface, and a newly developed immunomagnetic procedure in which cells are bound to antibody-coated magnetic beads that can be selectively removed on the basis of their behavior in a magnetic field (UNITS 7.3 & 7.4A) . These general methods for isolating cells are complemented by methods for isolating human lymphoid cell populations from tonsillar tissues, which can also be applied to other solid lymphoid tissues such as the spleen and lymph nodes, presented in UNIT 7.8. UNIT 7.4B describes two widely used methods to isolate (FACS) or to enrich (magnetic beads) human CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells from blood. The unit also includes an in vitro coculture assay to measure the anergic and suppressive features of human CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells. In addition, methods for accessing and purifying in situ lymphocyte populations are presented in the fourth section of the chapter (UNIT 7.30), which includes protocols for obtaining large numbers of purified, viable mononuclear cells from intestinal tissues.",

For example, the CD4 surface antigen does not identify a population of cells that exclusively expresses \"helper\" function, and the CD8 surface antigen does not mark a population of cells that exclusively expresses suppressor/cytokine function; on the contrary, these cell populations can act as either helper or suppressor/cytokine cells under certain circumstances. Another example concerns the difficulty of defining cells with natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell functions with a single surface marker; if one isolates NK/LAK cells by removal of T cells (UNIT 7.7), one also removes a small, but definite, subpopulation of cells with NK/LAK activity that bear T cell markers (i.e., CD3, CD8). The basis of these discrepancies is that, in reality, cell function is the result of a complex set of cell characteristics affected not only by the cell's capacity to produce lymphokines and other substances, but also by the nature of the cell-to-cell interactions permitted by the cell's array of antigen-specific and antigen-nonspecific cell-surface receptors. Despite these difficulties, this chapter presents methods for defining discrete subpopulations of cells whenever possible. Thus in UNIT 7.34, protocols are described that allow for the separation of NK cells from peripheral blood based upon cell-surface expression of CD56 (CD56 bright and CD56 dim ) and upon the amount of NK function.",

In this regard, even surface antigens generally considered to be incapable of transducing intracellular signals may do so under certain circumstances. For example, CD2, the sheep erythrocyte receptor, is in fact a protein through which the T cells can be activated under some conditions. The possibility that cell isolation may perturb cell function leads to the maxim that, whenever possible, cell isolation should be performed by negative selection. Third and finally, the expression of surface antigen being used to separate a cell population may be related to the activation state of the cell. In this regard, certain antigens may be expressed only when the cell is in a resting state and others only when the cell is in an activated state. Thus, cell separations based on surface antigens must be made with due regard for the activation state of the cells in the starting population.",

Although this method generally yields a cell population of higher purity than other techniques, the number of cells obtained is limited by the time necessary to perform cell sorting. Although cell separation methods (e.g., the use of immunomagnetic beads) are leading to cell purities that rival those achieved with sorting techniques while providing larger yields, these techniques may therefore be preferred, except when especially pure cell populations are necessary. The question of whether or not to use sorting to isolate a cell population frequently arises in relation to the isolation of purified human B cell populations. This is because B cells are present in peripheral blood in relatively low numbers and are difficult to separate from macrophages and null cells. Good purification can be achieved with positive cell sorting, using a cell population that is partially purified (lacking in T cells), and fluorescent antibodies to B cell-surface markers that do not (usually) affect cell function. Alternatively, a multistep negative selection procedure is described in UNIT 7.5.",

Methods of polyclonal stimulation of T cells presented here include techniques for the study of T cell proliferation with various mitogens (UNIT 7.10), anti-CD3 antibody (which activates the T cell via the T cell receptor complex), and biochemical stimulation with phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore (which activates the T cell via direct triggering of intracellular activation pathways; UNITS 7.10 & 7.11). These methods can be extended to measure T cell secretion of cytokine into the culture supernatant by one of the methods presented in Chapter 6.

It should be noted that B cells can also be activated in a polyclonal fashion by first activating T cells with anti-CD3, then mixing the activated T cells with B cells in the absence of a B cell stimulant. B cell activation/differentiation under these circumstances is due to polyclonal cellular interactions between T cells and B cells that in part involve stimulation of B cell via CD40 and OX40L. Under physiologic conditions, B cell development and differentiation are orchestrated by a variety of cell activation events. These occur both in the bone marrow (in the case of B cell precursors) and the periphery (e.g., in the case of germinal centers in lymphoid tissue). B cell development proceeds largely along a linear pathway. During this process, the developing cells take on characteristic immunophenotypic profiles that identify corresponding B cell subsets.

Thus, studies that rely only on Supplement 95 Current Protocols in Immunology the use of polyclonal stimulants must be interpreted with caution, and, in some instances, it is useful to verify results obtained with them using a bona fide antigen.

These are both mediated by overlapping (if not identical) cell subpopulations and are both direct cytotoxicities that do not involve target-cell recognition via the T cell receptor (and MHC restriction). However, they differ in that NK activity is found in fresh cell populations without addition of a stimulus, whereas LAK activity requires several days to develop in the presence of a lymphokine (IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7). In addition, NK and LAK cells differ in their capacity to lyse target cells; some targets are NK-resistant and LAK-sensitive. As alluded to earlier, the cells mediating NK and LAK cytotoxicity are phenotypically different, so total NK/LAK cytotoxic function is best assessed using whole or macrophage-depleted mononuclear cell populations (UNIT 7.7). To study NK/LAK activity using a more defined cell population, one can utilize positively selected cell populations obtained by immunomagnetic bead selection employing a combination of antibodies recognizing the spectrum of NK/LAK cells, such as anti-CD16 plus anti-CD56 (see APPENDIX 4).

These substances have powerful effects on the function of the other immune cells-influencing, among other things, cell traffic patterns, chemotaxis, and inflammatory responses. Methods for measurement of a variety of eicosanoids with potent regulatory effects on immune cells are therefore described in UNIT 7.33.",

It is important to realize, however, that the MAbs developed for delineation of human cells may not always recognize equivalent primate antigens. Formal study of mouse MAbs with specificity for many different T cell-and B cell-surface markers have shown that some are highly conserved, whereas others are expressed only in hominids and not in monkeys; in addition, there is no clear relation between conservation of structure and evolutionary distance (Clarke et al., 1983) .",

Biosafety level 2 (BL-2) applies to organisms capable of producing disease of moderate severity in normal healthy individuals. It assumes all the features of BL-1 and, in addition, applies more stringent conditions for laboratory cleaning, use of containment equipment (e.g., biosafety cabinets)-particularly if aerosols will be generated-and autoclaving of laboratory wastes. Biosafety level 3 (BL-3) applies to possible exposure to microorganisms capable of causing serious illness. This level differs from the BL-2 level in that it mandates for a double-door entry system into a sealed \"inner\" laboratory having a unidirectional airflow. At this biosafety level, tissue is manipulated only within biosafety cabinets, centrifugation of specimens is accomplished with sealed safety cups, and special clothing and gloves are routinely worn. Finally, BL-4 applies to laboratory work with pathogens that pose a life-threatening risk to laboratory workers when even \"casual\" contact with tissue occurs. The safety practices employed at this level are an intensification of those at the BL-3 level and include extensive clothing changes before entering the work area, decontamination of waste, strict training of all laboratory personnel, and the use of class II biosafety cabinets (which provide for physical isolation of specimens) or of lower-class cabinets in association with one-piece positive-pressure personnel suits ventilated by a life-support system.",

BL-3, on the other hand, is reserved for the more dangerous infectious agents and is the preferred level for research involving HIV-1. Both the BL-2 and BL-3 levels require the presence of a laboratory leader that is fully versed in safety practices, and, in addition, requires provision of safety training programs for workers and the establishment of laboratory-specific safety manuals. Particular attention must be given to the possibility of laboratory accidents that will result in infection of a laboratory worker (or waste handler) and the institution of strict procedures that prevent such accidents. Obvious examples here are the proscription of mouth pipetting and the use of instruments that cause skin breaks without adequate glove protection. It is essential that all persons working in a laboratory in which human tissues are being processed be fully aware of the potential for exposure to various pathogens present in the tissue. When a break in safety procedure and undue exposure does occur, it is the responsibility of everyone concerned to investigate the incident and to bring the exposed individuals to immediate medical attention.",
