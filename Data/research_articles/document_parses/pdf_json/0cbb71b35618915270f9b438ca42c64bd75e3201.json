Therefore, we sought to classify counties in the United States across multiple domains 30 utilizing a socioecological framework and examine the association between these county-level groups 31 and Covid-19 mortality. We harmonized and linked county-level sociodemographic, health, and 32 environmental metrics associated with increased susceptibility for Covid-19 mortality. Latent class 33 analysis defined a county-level susceptibility index (CSI) based on these metrics (n=2701 counties). 34 Next, we used linear regression models to estimate the associations of the CSI and Covid-19 deaths per 35 capita and initial mortality doubling time (as of 6/2/20), adjusted for days since first Covid-19 case. We 36 identified 4 groups classified by the CSI with distinct sociodemographic, health, and environmental 37 profiles and widespread geographic dispersion. Covid-19 deaths per capita were significantly higher in 38 the group consisting of rural, vulnerable counties (55.8 [95% CI 50.3-61.2] deaths per 100,000) 39 compared with the group with diverse, urban counties (32.2 [27.3-37.0]) at similar points in the outbreak 40", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome 44 coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and has rapidly emerged into a global pandemic. While the first case was 45 documented to originate in China in November 2019 1,2 , Covid-19 is now widespread across the world 3-6 46 and in particular, has a very high burden in the United States (US) 7 . As of June 2020, the US has the highest number of deaths in the world due to Covid-19. While Covid-19 initially affected certain states 48 more heavily in the early period of spread including Washington 8 and New York 9 , Covid-19 outbreaks 49 have continued to emerge across the US with cases now reported in over 2,600 counties. To date, clinical and epidemiological data published from China, Italy, and in the US, reported higher 52 rates of symptomatic Covid-19 disease and severity among older adults. 1, 8 In addition to advanced age, 53 history of chronic lung or cardiovascular disease (CVD) are key risk factors of adverse outcomes such as 54 hospitalization and mortality related to severe Covid-19 infection. 10 Significant race-based disparities 11 In this study, we described a novel county-level classification scheme based on ecological factors that 119 may be associated with mortality burden related to Covid-19 that identified 4 distinct CSI groupings. 120 This classification scheme leveraged and integrated county-level metrics across multiple key domains 121 (sociodemographic, health-related, and environmental) from multiple data sources to distinguish patterns 122 in underlying county-level vulnerability and resilience. While there was a significant difference in early 123 mortality doubling time related to Covid-19, with faster doubling in diverse urban counties with greater 124 social assets, the burden of Covid-19 deaths per capita is significantly higher in rural counties with 125 social and medical vulnerabilities. The CSI classification scheme identified discordance in the early 126 slope or rapidity of spread within the first week and total loss of life per capita due to Covid-19. We 127 posit this discrimination is likely related to diverse urban counties representing the initial Covid-19 128 outbreak areas in the US, likely due to the high population density and more frequent international travel 129 in these coastal areas, with a later shift of burden towards the rural and vulnerable Southern counties. Our findings are consistent with recent data highlighting the \"rural mortality penalty\" that has emerged 132 in the US since the 1980's and has been widening in recent years. 24 This place-based health 133 disadvantage has been demonstrated for all-cause mortality as well as leading causes of 134 noncommunicable disease, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, 25, 26 and likely reflects 135 convergence of multiple ecological factors related to social determinants of overall health, such as 136 income, education, and race. As spatial and temporal patterns of Covid-19 remain dynamic, the CSI 137 classification may inform location choices for future policy and intervention strategies to address the 138 burden of future waves, as the CSI scheme reflects differences in underlying vulnerabilities based on 139 social determinants of health in addition to comorbidity burdens and air pollution exposure at a 140 meaningful geographic scale (county-level).
