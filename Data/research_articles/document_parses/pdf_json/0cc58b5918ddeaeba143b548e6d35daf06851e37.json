Using this metric, we formulate the hydrodynamics theory for tilted Dirac/Weyl materials in d + 1 spacetime dimensions. We find that the mingling of spacetime through the off-diagonal components of the metric gives rise to: (i) heat and electric currents proportional to the temporal gradient of temperature, \u2202tT and (ii) a non-zero Hall condductance \u03c3 ij \u221d \u03b6 i \u03b6 i where \u03b6 j parametrizes the tilt in j'th space direction. The finding (i) above suggests that naturally available sources of \u2202tT in hot deserts can serve as new concept for the extraction of electricity from the spacetime geometry. We find a further tilt-induced non-Drude contribution to conductivity which can be experimentally disentangles from the usual Drude pole. arXiv:2007.03276v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 7 Jul 2020",

The purpose of this paper is to propose a class of materials where a temporal gradient \u2202 t T alone (i.e. without any spatial gradient) is sufficient to generate electric and/or heat currents. Why is it important to be able to derive current by temporal gradient? In the so called hot deserts such as Sahara or Kavir and Lut deserts of Iran, due to clear sky, the heat loss in the night is substantial and the daily variation of temperature can be as great as 22 \u2022 C 1 . Therefore the hot deserts with their cold midnights and hot noons can serve as a free provider of \u2202 t T through a half cycle of the spinning of the earth. Can this naturally available temporal gradient be employed in energy production?",

As we will discuss in this paper, there are certain materials where such a vector \u03b6 not only does exist, but additionally, it enters the effective description of the motion of electrons in such a way that it mingles space and time coordinates, whereby creates a new spacetime structure. As a result, even a pure temporal gradient of a spatially uniform temperature T can drive a current via mixing of the space and time coordinates arising from \u03b6.",

For the Dirac electrons in solids, the dispersion relation giving energy \u03b5 of the quasiparticles at every momentum k will be a Dirac cone, and enjoys an emergent Lorentz invariance at low energies corresponding to length scales much larger than the lattice spacing [5] . But in materials hosting a tilted Dirac cone, the cone-shaped dispersion relation is tilted in energy-momentum space [14, 15] . This tilt is characterized by set of parameters \u03b6. Presence of tilt in the Dirac cone, not only bestows the space with a preferred direction set by the vector \u03b6 [14, 15] , but also gives rise to an emergent spacetime structure [16] [17] [18] . It turns out that, the tilt can be attributed to an underlying metric of the spacetime [16, 19, 20] . Therefore in the same way that Dirac materials enjoy an emergent Lorentz symmetry arising from an emergent Minkowski spacetime at long wave length for the lattice at hand, those materials that host a tilted Dirac cone can be assigned an emergent spacetime structure at long length scales which is controlled by \u03b6 and is given by",

For the rest of the paper we will set v F = 1. The isometries of the spacetime (1) are appropriate deformations of the Lorentz group [16] . As such, the spacetime defined by Eq. (1) is a deformation of the Minkowski spacetime by a continuous parameter \u03b6. The presence of tilt \u03b6 modifies many of the physical properties of the materials, in particular including their interfaces with superconductors [21, 22] . The above metric possesses a blackhole horizon [23] that stems from spatial variation of the Gallilean boost \u03b6 in Eq. (1). Spatial variation of a parameter similar to \u03b6 can emulate a black-hole horizion in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates [24] , polariton superfluids [25, 26] . The spin-polarized currents are also predicted to implement blackhole horizon for magnons [27] . Our proposal differs from the above systems in that (i) the tilted Dirac/Weyl systems required are at ambient conditions and (ii) the quasiparticles of the theory are fermions, namely electrons and holes which carry electric charges. As such, any effects arising from the emergent structure of the spacetime, will leave direct signature in almost any electron spectroscopy experiment, including of course the transport (conductivity) measurements.",

Let us announce our result in advance: In any conductor, the spatial gradient of temperature can generate heat and electric currents. The mingling of the spacetime in Eq. (1) will allow the materials with tilted Dirac cone to generate heat and electric currents from pure temporal gradients. Our theoretical tool to bring out this result is the hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamic is an effective long-time and long-distance description of quantum many body systems that focuses on few conserved collective variables rather than embarking on the formidble task of addressing all the microscopic degrees of freedom.",

Applications of hydrodynamics approach in high energy physics includes quark-qluen plasma [29, 30] , parity violation [31] , chiral anomaly [32] and dissipative superfluid [33] . Within the hydrodynamic approach, one can come up with universal and model-independent predication such as kinematic viscosity value [34, 35] . The hydrodynamics approach can also be applied to fluid-gravity correspondence [36] which relate the dynamics of the gravity side to the hydrodynamic equations where the hydrodynamic fluctuation mode describes the fluctuations of black holes [37, 38] .

To understand these poles, we have defined a redshifted relaxation time \u03c4 lab imp = \u03b3\u03c4 imp . In this definition \u03c4 imp can be interpreted as the microscopic relaxation time experienced by electrons in the spacetime with a given \u03b6, while \u03c4 lab imp can be interpreted as the same time measured in the laboratory by the experimentalist sitting in the laboratory spacetime having \u03b6 = 0. As such, the pole at \u03c9 1 is a natural extension of the Drude pole to the geometry (1). However, the new pole \u03c9 2 arises from the new spacetime structure. Although at \u03b6 \u2192 0 limit it becomes degenerate with the Drude pole, but at \u03b6 \u2192 1 it can become up to 3 times larger than \u03c9 1 . Both poles are on the imaginary axis, and their real part is zero, as they are caused by very low-energy (Drude) excitations across the Fermi level. Then the question will be, is there a way to distinguish the contributions from the Drude pole \u03c9 1 and the spacetime pole \u03c9 2 ?

To disentangle their contribution, not that the meaning of the longitudinal conductivity \u03c3 xx is the current along the applied electric field (both assumed along the x direction). But then the x axis can subtend an angle \u03b8 with the tilt vector \u03b6. This can be an interesting variable. Therefore, in Fig. 1 we have plotted the dependence of the residudes of the longitudinal part of the conductivity on the polar angle \u03b8 of the tilt vector. The solid (dashed) lines correspond to the Drude-like pole \u03c9 1 (spacetime pole \u03c9 2 ). Various colors correspond to different tilt magnitudes. Both poles have a dipolar pattern. But their nodal structure is different which helps to identify which pole is contributing the spectral weight. When the electric field is applied along the tilt direction (\u03b8 = 0), the residue of the Drude-like pole vanishes and the absorption is contributed by \u03c9 2 pole. By rotating the applied electric field away from the tilt direction, the Drude-like pole \u03c9 1 takes over the spacetime pole \u03c9 2 . When the applied electric field is completely perpendicular to \u03b6, only \u03c9 1 contributes to the conductivity. The common feature of solid and dashed curves in Fig. 1 is that the spectral weight of both \u03c9 1 and \u03c9 2 poles decreases by increasing the tilt \u03b6. ",

Put it another way, the later means that the accumulative heat current vanishes if the externally applied field or temperature gradient is transverse to the tilt vector \u03b6. The accumulative nature (proportionality to time t during which the external field is applied) of this heat current means that if the experiment is perfomed for a long enough time t, it can take over any other terms in the heat current given in Eqns.

            "text": "One striking aspect of the transport of heat and electric currents in tilted Dirac cone systems is the appearance of new transport coefficients, \u03b2 i and \u03b3 i which are given by equations (25) and (36) , respectively. These vector transport coefficients (as opposed to tensor transport coefficients) relate the temporal gradients of electrochemical potential and temperature to electric and heat currents. As can be seen from Eqns. (25) and (36) , at the present order of calculations, these are frequency independent and are furthermore proportional to the only available vector, namely \u03b6 i . The fact that these vector transport coefficients are given by product of \u03c3 Q and \u03b6 i , means that these coefficients quantifying the conversion of temporal gradients to electric and heat currents are essentially determined by the ability \u03c3 Q of the material to conduct (electricity). In the absence of tilt in normal conductors, since the vector \u03b6 i is zero, there will be no preferred dirction in the space, and therefore the vector transport coefficients \u03b3 i and \u03b2 i remain inert. In tilted Dirac materials, these vector transport coefficients find a unique opportunity to become active and play a significant role. Generally, there can be materials with odd number of Dirac valleys [51] . But quite often, the Dirac cones come in pairs. This has to do with Fermion doubling problem according to which, putting a Dirac theory on a (hypercubic) lattice doubles the number of Dirac fermions [52] . In the former case where the number of Dirac nodes is odd, there is no challenge and the vector transport coefficients are already active. But the later case corresponding to lattices on which Fermion doubling occures, requires some discussion: If the material is inversion symmetric, its two valleys come with tilt parameters \u03b6 \u00b1 = \u00b1\u03b6 [20] . Since the number of Dirac valleys is even, the currents from the two valleys cancel each other. Therefore, despite that the \u03b2 i and \u03b3 i transport coefficients for a single valley are active, for the whole mateirial hosting even number of valleys they cancel each other's effect in an infinite system. However, if the materials lacks an inversion center such that \u03b6 + + \u03b6 \u2212 becomes non-zero, then a net electric (heat) current enabled by the coefficient \u03b2 i (\u03b3 i ) can flow in response to temporal gradient of temperature (or electrochemical potential if one wishes to make it depend on time). Therefore one possible rout to realization of the present effect is to search for a tilted Dirac cone in a material without inversion center.",

As before, the vertitcal lobe (blue) corresponds to the Drudelike pole \u03c9 1 , while the horizontal lobe (red) corresponds to the spacetime pole \u03c9 2 . Fig. 6 nicely shows how the viscous flow is continuously connected to the ideal flow. One further information that can be extracted from this figure is that the spectral intensity in ideal flow is larger than the viscous flow. Although the quantitative difference is small, but it shows that the light can be better absorbed by the viscous TDFs than the ideal TDFs. Now that we have given a comprehensive comparison between the conductivity tensor for the ideal and viscous flow of TDFs, we are ready to present the actual experimentally expected conductivity lineshapes. As noted in Eq. (26) and (27) imaginary and their real part is zero. This comforms to the intution, as in a Fermi surface built on a tilted Dirac cone dispersion, one does not expect higher energy absorptions to take place. One still has the low-energy particle-hole excitations across the Fermi surface. Fig. 7 shows the real (solid line) and imaginary (dashed line) parts of the longitudinal conductivity \u03c3 xx for the fluid of TDFs. The viscosity corresponds to T = 150K. The angle is chosen to be \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 because as we learned from Figs. 1 and 4, along this direction both \u03c9 1 and \u03c9 2 poles comparably contribute. As can be seen, larger tilt values reduce the height of the Drude peak. Figure 8 shows the same information as Fig. 7 for the Hall conductivity \u03c3 xy .

The essential feature of these materials is that the \"tilt\" deformation of the Dirac (or Weyl if we are in three space dimensions) can be neatly encoded into the spacetime metric. As such, these materials are bestowed with an emergent spacetime geometry which distinguishes them from the rest of solid state systems. What our hydrodynamics theory in this paper predicts is that the mixing of space and time coordinates in such solids gives rise to transport properties which have no analogue in other solid state systems where there is no mixing between space and time coordinates.",

These Hall coefficients appear in both charge and heat transport. By generic symmetry structure of the spacetime in such solids, the conductivity tensors will be proportional to g ij = \u03b4 ij \u2212 \u03b6 i \u03b6 j . This is the root cause of Hall coeffient without a magnetic field. The intuitive understanding of the anomalous Hall response \u03c3 xy \u223c \u03b6 1 \u03b6 2 come from the small tilt limit where the tilt can be viewed as a boost parameter that converts the electric field into a magnetic field, whereby a Hall response can be generated.

The fact that the nature provides free \u2202 t T in hot deserts from mid-night to midday might transfrom this unique capability of TDFs into a technological revolution. This property arises, because the strcture of spacetime in tilted Dirac fermion solids is such that it allows for a mixing between space and time coordinates. Therefore it is not surprising that temporal gradients can drive currents, pretty much the same way spatial gradients can drive currents. We have introduced the notion of vector transport coefficients (as opposed to commonly used, tensor ones), to formalize and quantify these effects. The important technological advantage of such effects is that, via the vector transport coefficient \u03b2 i , a gradual heating of these materials (\u2202 t T ) generates electric currents. Furthermore we find that this transport coefficient is given by \u03b2 i = \u03c3 Q \u03b6 i which is nothing but the ability \u03c3 Q of the material to conduct and the tilt vector \u03b6.",

To remedy this, either one has to search for tilted Dirac cone materials with odd number of Dirac cones [51] , or if they have even number of Dirac nodes, one has to search in lattices with broken inversion symmetry that violates \u03b6 + = \u2212\u03b6 \u2212 . Still there is a hope even if none of these systems are available: Building on the ideas of valleytronics [53, 54] , populating a system of TDFs that possesses even number of Dirac nodes with \u03b6 + = \u2212\u03b6 \u2212 , appropriately chosen boundaries in nano-electronic devices can still give rise to out-of-equilibirum valley polarization effects that will eventually generate a non-zero total current from temporal gradients of T (and/or \u00b5). In fact in such valleytronics setup, the valley polarization translates into an effective \u03b6 polarization which therefore activates a net non-zero vector transport coefficient. The corresponding heat transport coefficient \u03b3 i makes materilas with TDFs a suitable candidate in applications that require to direct the heat current into a given direction. This direction in TDFs is set by \u03b6. In this appendix we give explicit expressions for the transport coefficients of TDFs. The inverse matrix F \u22121 used in (42) is computed as follows",
