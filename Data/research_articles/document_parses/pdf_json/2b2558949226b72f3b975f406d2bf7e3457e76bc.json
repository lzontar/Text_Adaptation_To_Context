During 2013 -2014, the area under French Polynesia encountered the largest viral outbreak due to Zika [3] which grew to be of alarming concern as was a threat to the world. ZIKV is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes [4] . It can be diagnosed via some of the molecular or other serologic testing involving blood, saliva (for neonates) [5] , urine [6] , etc. The minor infection results in lowgrade fever, myalgia, maculopapular rashes, and in severe cases, adults encounter neurological and congenital structural defects [7] . It may also cause congenital malformations in pregnant woman with fetal and newborn with microcephaly [8] . It was also found that Sertoli cells of mouse testis were susceptible to ZIKV infection, which implied that ZIKV can be transmitted sexually affecting human male reproductive system [9] . ZIKV also affects the eyes of adults mildly, but significantly in infants with infected mothers [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 225, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 313, "end": 316, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 421, "end": 424, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 545, "end": 548, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 663, "end": 666, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 675, "end": 678, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 849, "end": 852, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 957, "end": 960, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1148, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1250, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In [10] , Xia et al showed that ZIKV fixes the mutations in NS1 gene that enhances mosquito infection and increases its ability to dodge immune response. The ZIKV infection also activates the P53 gene, causing genotoxic stress in the neural progeni-tors cells (NPCs) of human, similar to mutations as observed in genetically caused microcephaly and p53 [11] . ZIKV primarily targets the CD14 human blood monocytes inducing M2-skewed immune-suppression during pregnancy [12] . Autophagy process plays dual roles in ZIKV infection as both good and bad based on the viral replication stage [13] . ZIKV infection also affects peripheral nervous systems (PNS) as well as central nervous system, causing transcriptional dysregulation which results to cell death [14] . ZIKV depletes the NPCs in human cerebral organoids by triggering TLR3 receptor for innate immunity [15] . Though there are some licensed vaccines for other flaviviruses, still emerging threat of ZIKV outbreak laid urgent need of developing preventive vaccines and treatments for infected patients. Several candidate vaccines have been developed and identified potent for this usage, but they are not ready for widespread use. Makhluf & Shresta [16] described the development of ZIKV vaccines by utilizing the past knowledge from other dengue and flavivirus involving viral vectors, DNA-RNA dependent vaccines, live attenuated virus, immunogenic viral epitopes predicted in silico and also inactivated virus. Mesci et al. [17] showed that an FDA approved compound called Sofosbuvir (SOF), effective for Hepatitis C (HCV), also prevented human NPCs from ZIKV infection-mediated cell death. It also prevented vertical transmission of infection from infected mother to fetus [17] .

RNA-seq technology uses the NGS method that gives the snapshot of RNA present in some genome sample along with its quantification at a given moment of time. It is preferred over the Microarray technology for gene expression studies [2] [19] . The research in RNA-seq includes studying the altered pathway during infection or disease, gene expression changes (differential expression analysis), etc. RNA-seq along with other NGS platforms (SNP, CGH arrays) can be used in the detection of CNV behind gene expression and novel genes behind tumorogenesis [20] . RNA-seq is cheaper, highly sensitive and faster than traditional sequencing methods, detects more transcripts than microarray technology [21] . Though RNA-seq analysis is considered as the standard expression profiling methodology, still easy, open and standard pipelines for performing this task by non-expert research community with different background is a major challenge. The read quantification and differentially analyzing the expression data based on high throughput NGS data, such as RNA-seq are highly appreciated.
