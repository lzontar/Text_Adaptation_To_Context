K represents the conductance of the capillary wall, determined by the resistance offered to the water flow by the capillary endothelial cell junctions [1] . T represents the permeability of the capillary membranes to the macromolecules. Lymphatic drainage is another pathway for handling excess water in the lungs. However, the lymphatic drainage needs time to be effective, and in the acute situation, it often fails to eliminate the excess fluid [2] . Classically grouped into cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic variants, the pulmonary edema can be divided into the following four types based on the pathophysiology [3] ( Almost all pulmonary edema presentations in critical care units are due to increased hydrostatic pressure or increased permeability with DAD.

Air bronchograms typically associated with pneumonia result from the complete filling of the alveolar spaces around nonobstructed bronchi. However, when the airways get filled with mucus, air bronchograms are not seen on imaging which is often the case in critically ill patients (Fig. 7.9 ).

An intrafissural location of the tube may or may not affect its function; however, rarely it may result in herniation of lung parenchyma into the holes of chest tube leading to infarction [39] . Inadvertent parenchymal insertion of a chest tube (Fig. 7.24 ) can lead to pulmonary laceration, hematoma, infarction, and bronchopleural fistula. Besides the lung parenchyma, an inappropriately positioned chest tube can injure the heart, great vessels, diaphragm, liver, and spleen [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 656, "end": 660, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 851, "end": 855, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1145, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 210, "end": 220, "text": "(Fig. 7.23", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 908, "end": 918, "text": "(Fig. 7.24", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Chest Tubes and Pleural Drains"}, {"text": "Interpretation of ICU radiographs is a challenging task.
