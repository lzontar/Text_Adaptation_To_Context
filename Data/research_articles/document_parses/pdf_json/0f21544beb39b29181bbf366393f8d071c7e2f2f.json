While hospital-grade, core lab devices can achieve massive throughput (thousands of 438 samples per day), a key limitation of these assays is accessibility of testing facilities to patients, 439 the logistics of sample transport, and timely test reporting. These limitations become even more 440 stark in the context of widespread quarantines and nationwide lockdowns, where requiring 441 patients to travel (even for viral testing) incurs significant personal and public health risks. 442 443", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "451 Specifically, LAMP positivity may quickly indicate if an area is infectious and a negative result 452(with appropriate confirmation) will possibly represent a lower risk. Indeed, these tools and 453 methods can help create a viral \"weather report\" if broadly used and partnered with continual 454 validation. 455 456Total RNA-sequencing data enabled a complete genetic map of the viruses in a significant subset 457 of our samples. Remarkably, we found 9 qRT-PCR negative cases among the 155 cases that had 458 sufficient reads to assemble the SARS-CoV-2 genome de novo. Though these likely qRT-PCR 459 false negatives could not be attributed to specific sequence changes (e.g. primer site mutations), 460 their high frequency underscores the limitation of \"gold standard\" qRT-PCR approaches for 461 SARS-CoV-2 detection. These results further highlight the need for open-source primer design 462(the RT-PCR methods for this FDA-approved test are proprietary), so these assays can be 463 updated as a more granular picture of strain diversity and evolution is obtained through of strains within this subclade. The first possibility may be potentially 477 linked to expansion among cases in the New Rochelle cluster, though additional genotyping 478 and/or metadata aggregation from those sequenced cases would be required to assess this 479 hypothesis. The third possibility could be consistent with A2-25563 harboring differential 480 fitness with respect to transmissibility or virulence relative to other A2 viruses. 481 482Future studies correlating viral genotypes with patient outcomes in larger cohorts will be 483 necessary to determine whether any of these A2-25563 associated variants functionally influence 484 viral transmission or disease severity. The polyphyletic pattern and convergent evolution pattern 485 observed with NSP1 p.141_143KSD, including clades outside of A2, raises the possibility that 486 this variant arose multiple times and may be under positive selection. Given the small number of 487 these variants observed in our analysis (14), larger and more statistically powered datasets will 488 be required to evaluate this hypothesis.

Comparison of the effects of different ACEIs (benazepril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril) and ARBs (losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan) when compared to patients exposed to other ACEIs or ARBs, respectively. There were no significant findings amongst the different ACEIs. However, among the ARBs we found that olmesartan was associated with a significant increase in mortality (HR=2.3 CI: 1.1-4.9, p=3.05E-02).
