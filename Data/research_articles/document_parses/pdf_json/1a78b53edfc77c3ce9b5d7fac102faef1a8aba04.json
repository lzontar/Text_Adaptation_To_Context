A secondary aim was to describe variation in surge capability by ICU type (tertiary, metropolitan, regional/rural, private) and jurisdiction, as well as surge capability with respect to other ICU equipment and clinical and nursing staffing levels.",

For senior medical staff, the best case estimate assumed that absenteeism did not increase and that the need for additional staffing could be reduced by 20% in the short term by increasing the available clinical full-time equivalent (FTE) staff level by reducing leave, increasing the work hours of part-time employees, and by temporarily delegating certain roles outside the ICU to ward staff (eg, follow-up clinics, tracheostomy, and total parenteral nutrition rounds). Conversely, worst case estimates assumed no increase in the work hours of existing staff and that a 30% increase in staff numbers would be required to compensate absenteeism. The worst case estimate for nursing staff included a further 10% increase to account for the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (requiring one-to-one nursing care) increasing from 50% to 70% under pandemic conditions.",

            "text": "Our study provides further important information. First, staffing is required for additional ICU beds. Even in the best case scenario, the staffing requirements associated with maximal surge intensive care bed capacity are extremely high. This applies in particular to the increased demand for nursing staff, as a bedside nurse is required for each additional surge patient receiving mechanical ventilation. Strategies and resources for rapidly preparing registered nurses to manage mechanically ventilated patients are urgently required. Similarly, senior ICU doctors may be required to act as supervisors for several groups of patients, assisted by other senior clinicians with overlapping skill sets, such as anaesthetists, in order to maintain safe patient-to-physician ratios. The optimal modifications of standard ICU staffing models during a surge will differ between sites and according to local capabilities. Their impacts on resource use and patient outcomes are uncertain and will require investigation.",

With appropriate preparation, the risk associated with using these ventilators would be lower than for ventilators not normally used in ICUs or equipment unfamiliar to critical care staff. In addition, the veterinary sector may also provide additional physical capacity, pharmaceutical resources, and staff who could assist with intensive care.",

Rural and regional ICUs have high proportions of vulnerable patients and rely on inter-hospital transfer systems that may be overwhelmed in a crisis. 10 It is unlikely that patients with COVID-19 would be transferred interstate, but we found that equipment and staffing levels may be rate-limiting factors.
