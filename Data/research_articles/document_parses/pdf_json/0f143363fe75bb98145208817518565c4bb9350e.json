It presents with variable, fluctuating muscle weakness, most commonly affecting the ocular, bulbar, respiratory and limb muscles (generalized MG) These symptoms can rapidly worsen (\"exacerbation\") with potential for airway compromise (\"crisis\") due to triggers such as infection. Plasma exchange (PLEX) and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) are the mainstay of management during such episodes (1) . Given that many MG patients are on immune-modulating medications, there's possibly an increased risk of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) (2). Per the Centers for Disease Control, symptoms from SARS CoV 2 can include fever, cough, respiratory distress, diarrhea, and reduction of smell and taste sensations (3). Additionally, if there is coexisting respiratory muscle weakness, MG patients can be at an increased risk of COVID-19-related complications (2). In this case report, we discuss the presentation of a generalized MG exacerbation with co-existing COVID-19 symptoms and its management.",

Per their recommendations, therapy decisions should be tailored to each patient; immunosuppressive medication should be continued, unless specifically discussed and approved by healthcare providers. Furthermore, they recommend continuing the current MG standard of care treatment during hospitalizations. There may be a need to increase corticosteroid dose as is typical in infection/stress steroid protocols; however, if COVID-19 symptoms are severe, it may be important to temporarily pause immunosuppression. Immune depleting agents should be avoided, whereas standard immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and mycophenolate can be continued given that they are longer acting (similar to our case). In addition, there is currently no evidence suggesting that IVIG or PLEX increase the risk of COVID-19 infections (2).",

Additional guidelines from Sol\u00e9 et al.
