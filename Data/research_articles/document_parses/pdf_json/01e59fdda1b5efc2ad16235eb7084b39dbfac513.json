Currently, no suitable tissue culture system is available for proliferating RHDV, limiting the study of the pathogenesis of RHDV. In addition, the mechanisms underlying RHDV translation and replication are largely unknown compared with other caliciviridae viruses. The RHDV replicon recently constructed in our laboratory provides an appropriate model to study the pathogenesis of RHDV without in vitro RHDV propagation and culture. Using this RHDV replicon, we demonstrated that the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) is essential for RHDV translation in RK-13 cells for the first time. In addition, we showed that VPg interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in vivo and in vitro and that eIF4E silencing inhibits RHDV translation, suggesting the interaction between VPg and eIF4E is involved in RHDV translation. Our results support the hypothesis that VPg serves as a novel cap substitute during the initiation of RHDV translation.",

            "text": "Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is the causative agent of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), which is characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high mortality [1] . After its initial identification in China in 1984 [2] , RHD outbreaks have subsequently been reported in other Asian countries [3] , Europe [4] , Mexico [5] , and other countries worldwide [6] . The RHDV belonging to the Caliciviridae family [1, 7, 8] is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The complete genomic sequence of a German isolate of RHDV has been determined and is 7,437 nucleotides (nt) in length [7] . A long open reading frame (ORF) of 2,344 codons (ORF1) and a short ORF of 118 codons (ORF2) have been identified in the genome of RHDV. A nonstructural protein (NSP1-7) and virion coat protein (VP60) were predicted in the C-terminus of ORF1, and a minor structural protein (VP10) was identified in the N-terminus of ORF2 [7, 9] . The 5 0 end of the RHDV genome is covalently linked to the viral protein, VPg [10] , and a polyadenylated tail was identified at the 3 0 end of the RHDV genome, as shown in Fig 1A. Due to the lack of a suitable culture system for RHDV, the mechanism of RHDV translation is largely unknown compared with other RNA viruses, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus, avian influenza virus, and poliovirus [11] . However, Goodfellow et al. have significantly improved our understanding of the translation of calicivirus mRNA. Their results demonstrated that caliciviruses use a novel protein-directed translation mechanism in which the interaction between translation initiation factors and VPg plays an important role [12] [13] [14] . This novel translation mechanism has never been reported in any other animal RNA viruses. While the virus-encoded protein (VPg) is covalently linked to the 5 0 end of the RHDV genome [10] , the biological functions of VPg, especially its role in translation, are not clear. In the present study, we provide evidence that VPg plays an essential role in RHDV translation. Deletion of VPg significantly inhibited RHDV translation, and this effect was restored by trans-supplementation of VPg protein. Additionally, VPg interacted with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and eIF4E silencing significantly inhibited RHDV translation. Our results suggested that VPg serves as a novel 'cap substitute' during the initiation of RHDV mRNA translation.",

To visualize the interaction between VPg and eIF4E, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay was conducted in RK-13 cells. As shown in Fig 4B, the VPg-eIF4E interaction was observed in cytoplasm of RK-13 cells. Quantitative analysis of the green fluorescence by flow cytometry showed that the BiFC signal-to-noise (Ratio between the treatment and control groups) was greater than three at 48 h post-transfection (Fig 4C) . Therefore, those results suggested that VPg interact with eIF4E.",

As 4EBP1 protein is a specific binding protein of eIF4E, we chose it as a competitor to inhibit the binding ability of VPg to eIF4E. RK-13 cells were co-transfected with the p4EBP1 (using gradually increasing doses), pRHDV-luc and peGFP plasmids together with the pIRES-Rluc plasmid. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the RK-13 cells were lysed, and the levels of Rluc and Fluc were quantified using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, USA). As shown in Fig 5, [16] . The coding regions of viral structural proteins were replaced with Fluc using fusion PCR. In the fusion PCR results, a gray box denotes the coding region of the viral structural proteins, and lines indicate the 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs.

The luciferase activity in RK13 cells was evaluated by measuring the firefly luciferase activity at different time points after transfection. Renilla luciferase activity measured at the same time points was used to normalize the transfection efficiency. The differences in luciferase activities associated with pRHDV-luc/\u0394VPg + pVPg and pRHDV-luc/\u0394VPg were compared using SAS 9.1 software.

The 5 0 cap-dependent mechanism contributes to translation initiation in Alphaviruses, Flaviviruses, Coronaviruses, and Arteritis viruses, whereas viruses such as Rhinovirus, Enterovirus Cardiovirus, and Aphthovirus utilize a cap-independent strategy for translation initiation. In the cap-independent strategy, ribosomes bind directly to an internal site of the 5 0 non-coding region (NCR) of the viral genome. The 5 0 UTR of caliciviruses is significantly shorter than The interaction between VPg and eIF4E in RK13 cells based on the mammalian two-hybrid assay.

RK13 cells co-transfected with the pACT-MyoD (1 \u03bcg) and pBIND-ID (1 \u03bcg) plasmids served as positive controls [25] . A blank control was also used. In addition, all of the groups were transfected with pGL4.75 (0.2 \u03bcg). The cells were lysed at 48 h post-transfection, and Fluc activity was evaluated based on RLUs and normalized according to the results obtained for a co-transfected plasmid encoding the Renilla luciferase. The experiments were conducted in triplicate, and similar results were obtained from three independent experiments. The Student's t test and ANOVA were applied for the statistical analyses, P <0.01 was considered as extremely significant different (**). that of other positive-stranded RNA virus genomes. For example, the RHDV 5 0 UTR comprises only 9 nt. In addition, there is no cap structure at the 5 0 end of Calicivirus genomic RNA. Thus, a novel mechanism is involved in the translation initiation of caliciviruses.",

            "text": "Goodfellow et al. demonstrated that feline calicivirus (FCV) and murine norovirus (MNV) use a novel protein-directed translation initiation mechanism [13, 14, 27] , in which the translation initiation factors interact with VPg. This novel translation initiation mechanism has been discovered in some plant viruses, for example, potyvirus translation initiated by VPg interact with eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) iso 4E (eIF(iso)4E) [28] and turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) translation initiation directed by VPg forms a ternary complex with eIF(iso)4E and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) iso 4G (eIF(iso)4G) [29, 30] . But it has never been reported in other animal RNA viruses. RHDV is one of the most important members of the Lagovirus genera in the Caliciviridae family. The molecular mechanisms underlying RHDV translation and replication are largely unknown due to the lack of suitable tissue culture systems. We recently established an experimental RHDV replicon system [16] , in which a Fluc gene is fused in-frame with the viral ORF of the deleted structural genes of the virus. The translation and replication levels of the replicon can be evaluated by detecting a reporter gene. In the present study, to elucidate the role of VPg in RHDV translation, we deleted the coding region of VPg in the replicon. Transfected RK-13 cells revealed that the VPg deletion significantly reduced the expression of the reporter gene, suggesting that VPg was involved in viral translation. The expression level of Fluc was almost completely restored when VPg was trans-supplemented by transfecting the To date, only norovirus VPg has been shown to interact with eIF3 and eIF4E; however, an in vitro study of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate revealed that eIF4E is not essential for the translation of MNV RNA [13] . Interestingly, the interaction between VPg and eIF4E is necessary for translation initiation of FCV mRNA. Therefore, it is likely that VPg interacts with multiple components of the translation initiation factor complex and that not all of these interactions are essential for viral RNA translation. In the present study, we found that RHDV VPg interacted with eIF4E, and both VPg and eIF4E were essential for the translation of RHDV in RK-13 cells. These findings suggest that RHDV VPg also acts as a proteinaceous \"cap substitute\" to attract ribosomes to the viral mRNA through interactions with the cap-binding protein eIF4E. Further functional studies of VPg and RHDV translation are ongoing to determine whether all of the components of the eIF4F complex are required for the initiation of translation. ",
