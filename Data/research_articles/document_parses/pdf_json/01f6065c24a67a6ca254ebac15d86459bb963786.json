Meanwhile, their customers, the smelters, addressed complexity either by developing new processes or by modifying operating conditions to enhance the removal of deleterious elements. In some cases, synergies and cooperation between base metal processing facilities have improved recovery and waste management.

Global weighted average of copper concentrate output in a large sample of plants was around 25% copper in 2015 data. There are significant data published on the falling copper ore grades in recent decades, but a factor of concern is that the ore grades in recently operational mines are not over 0.53%, while copper grades in new projects and in undeveloped mines are not over 0.43% copper on average. 2 The results of the copper mine ore grades survey carried out by the ICSG are shown in Fig. 1 . A review of the copper reserves in million tonnes of copper and the copper ore grades (percentage of copper) using the latest data for the top 56 copper mines of the world, ranked by reserves, produced the following findings: only 9 of the 56 copper mines with the largest reserves of copper presented copper ore grades over 1% copper content; and only 7 of the 56 copper mines with more copper reserves presented reserves over 40 million tonnes each. So, in 40 cases, representing almost 73% of the copper mines with important reported reserves, the copper ore grades are below 1% copper and the reserves are below 40 million tonnes copper content.",

            "text": "Many copper resources and reserves in mineral deposits report higher copper content than porphyry deposit, however, the most abundant low-grade porphyry deposits were mined first, and this is the reason why global copper ore grades went down on average during 1990-2018. Current technology to extract low-grade copper reserves indicates that higher-grade copper deposits are not necessarily mined first. Many low ore grade deposits remain operating as is the case of Morenci, Toquepala, Cerro Verde, Centinela, Quebrada Blanca, Cuajone, Radomiro Tomic, and Los Bronces. The grade produced from established mines tends to reduce with age. Other relatively low-grades deposit, such as Quellaveco, are advancing in the project pipeline. However other high-grade deposits, such as the Olympic Dam expansions, Pokowice, Oyu Tolgoy, Grasberg Underground, and other higher ore grade projects, are slowly advancing to the production stage. 3 Higher throughput rates and more efficient mineral processing has maintained copper output; however, with lower feed copper content and increasing energy and water use per unit of output, extraction costs have been increasing in important copper mines. Using the Chilean copper mining industry as an example, the use of fossil fuels increased over 33% in 2010-2018, while the use of electricity increased by around 38% in this same period. 4 From the mine processing point of view, the reduction in ore grades and mineralogy changes suggest the need to adapt current mining and mineral processing techniques to maintain production targets of metal units and quality. However, in some cases, opposite strategies have been followed. For example, some Chinese operations have processed low-grade copper concentrates. 5 These trends suggest a dynamic balance between copper mines and processers in terms of defining where to invest and where is the best place to remove each impurity. This requires a balance between metal recovery, processing cost, acid production, and slag generation. Figure 2 shows data on the composition of 32 major traded concentrates, with the mineral composition calculated from publicly available assay data (which should therefore be considered to be approximate). 6 Expanding the data to 180 traded concentrates shows an average grade of 27% Cu, even though concentrates average only around 55-60% copper sulfides. This is due to the presence of the minerals chalcocite (79.9%Cu) and covellite (66.4%Cu), which are much higher grade than chalcopyrite (34.6%Cu).",

            "text": "However, chalcocite and covellite are secondary copper sulfides that occur in higher proportions in the close-to-surface ore zones. As the shallower zones are depleted, more mines are moving into deeper areas with increased primary mineralization, that is, a higher proportion of copper is contained in chalcopyrite (New African deposits are the exception to the industry trend towards higher chalcopyrite, but concentrates from African mines are rarely traded internationally.) This will cause a gradual decrease in the copper concentrate grade of traded concentrates, unless efforts are made to make concentrates mineralogically cleaner; that is, the proportion of copper sulfides would have to increase above the current level of 55-60% by removing more iron sulfides and non-sulfide gangue minerals. To achieve this, concentrators would need to increase the mineral processing ''power'', including finer regrinding and more intense flotation cleaning of the concentrates. These modifications to grinding and flotation require more capital investment and increase operating costs at the mine site, so many operators will choose to pass the lower-grade concentrates to smelters instead, so long as their concentrate is marketable and the penalties are less than the required capital and operating costs. This is reflected in the increase in the use of blending facilities as the primary tool to reduce the impact of complexity in smelters. Figure 3 shows the blending facilities strategically located around the globe. Table II summarizes the effects on copper smelting of this trend to the increasing proportion of copper from chalcopyrite from deeper copper mines.",

Table III shows a compilation of metallurgical complex processing plants that were or are currently operating in the western world, aiming to use base metal carrier properties to optimize and maximize precious metal recovery. In most of these plants, base metal volume production is not as relevant as the concentration of valuable precious metals. These plants can potentially process industrial wastes, city incinerator metallic sub-products, recycling oils, and others. Countries like Korea and Japan have been pioneers in this approach at their non-ferrous operating plants. Metallurgical plants in Japan are using a similar approach by integrating primary and secondary complex processing sites and maximizing synergies between them to increase metal recovery. In the case of Japan, special emphasis has been made to process complex secondary raw materials and industrial waste using the ability of existing smelting facilities to recover valuable metals.

Arsenic content has gradually increased in copper concentrates to levels that are almost above the standard arsenic blending concentrations that most western smelters in Europe, Asia (excluding China), and North America can operate. A clear example of the gradual increase of arsenic in copper concentrates can be demonstrated by the behavior in the blends processed in Japan. According to the Metals Economics Institute of Japan, arsenic content in copper concentrates processed in Japanese smelters has gradually increased since 1991 from 400 ppm to over 1,000 ppm in 2016, while the copper content in the concentrates decreased from near 33% to 27%Cu. 26 This represents a 3 times increase in the units of As per unit of Cu in the feed. The same report estimates that standard copper concentrate blends could increase to 3,000 ppm if new high As-containing deposits are brought into operation. Introducing such complex high-arsenic copper concentrates would require large amounts of clean concentrates to dilute the arsenic contents to levels acceptable from the technical and economic points of view by copper smelter. 27 The impact of a small increase in the tonnes of high-arsenic concentrates is illustrated in Fig. 10 . 28 Because of the more than tenfold higher arsenic units per unit of concentrate, what appears to be a small increase in the amount of high-arsenic concentrates forecast in Mayhew et al. 28 almost doubles the arsenic units at smelting. Even if there were sufficient low-arsenic concentrates to dilute the average arsenic to acceptable limits, the smelting industry would still face a significant increase in the units (tonnes) of arsenic to be processed and disposed. This would appear to be an unsustainable position for the predominantly urban-located smelting industry. It indicates that technologies need to be adopted to reduce the arsenic content of copper concentrates at mine sites.",

It is almost always more efficient to remove an impurity at ambient temperature and pressure in mineral processing rather than in smelting-so long as that impurity is in a discrete identifiable mineral. When arsenic in the current ''baseload'' of traded concentrates occurs in the form of arsenopyrite (FeAsS), or is apparently dissolved in iron sulfides, then it can be reduced by mineral separation applying modern fine regrinding and washed-froth cleaning. This is more technically efficient than removing the arsenic in smelting, but it is not always more economic for the miner. Though the technology is well proven, it requires capital investment and increases mine-site operating costs. Current concentrate contracts do not generally reward this investment-that is, they do not send the correct cost ''signals'' to achieve the most efficient solution for the overall processing industry. Usually mine sites only adopt these technologies if they are essential to market their concentrate-for example, some of the sites that produce the highest quality concentrates in Fig. 2 do so in order to achieve limits on impurities such as U or F. The mineral processing steps to reduce the impurities to acceptable levels for marketing coincidentally reduce other mineral contamination, resulting in a significantly higher concentrate grade in high copper recovery (though in a finer-grained concentrate). If more accurate economic signals were sent through concentrate contracts, or if the copper industry agreed to an ''arsenic code'', then the average arsenic level of currently traded concentrates could also be reduced.",

Very small chemical ''windows'' for partial separation have been demonstrated in laboratory work, but these do not appear robust enough for practical application.
