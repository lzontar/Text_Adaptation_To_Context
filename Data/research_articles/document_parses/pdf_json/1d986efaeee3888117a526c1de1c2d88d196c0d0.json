Their analysis focused particularly on biomedical research, but the issues are general to biotech research applications, including agricultural and veterinary medicinal. They used the term \"tragedy of the anticommons\" in contrast with the \"tragedy of the commons,\" which popularized the observation that common property resources are overexploited because no one has a preservation incentive (Hardin 1968 ). While the \"commons\" concept argues for privatization, Heller and Eisenberg (1998, p. 698) cautioned that overprivatization creates fragmented ownership and high transaction costs-an anticommons. \"Privatization can solve one tragedy but cause another.\"",

            "text": "The anticommons potential is of ongoing significance because of the cumulative nature of scientific research. Reductions in access to past developments diminish current and all future research productivity. Economists explain those reductions in terms of transactions costs: more and potentially overlapping patents increase the costs of negotiating access, which causes further declines in output. That point is tively preempt anyone else from using that gene itself for any medical or scientific basis.\" 2 Myriad Genetics had patented two isolated genes-referred to as BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated with an elevated risk for developing breast and uterine cancer and utilized in diagnostic testing. The unanimous June 2013 decision bans patents on naturally occurring DNA segments (\"isolated DNA\") as products of nature while permitting them for complementary DNA (cDNA), which is not naturally occurring. As part of their ruling, the justices quoted a lower court decision that allowing patents for isolated DNA would create a \"considerable danger\" that \"patents would 'tie up' the use of such tools and thereby 'inhibit future innovation premised upon them ' (p. 2116) .\" Indeed, the patent validity case was brought by a researcher who used a different diagnostic lab to perform the genetic testing but ceased after receiving a warning letter from Myriad Genetics. Note should be made though that the plaintiff was involved with commercial use of Myriad's invention, not research access. Indeed, in its court filings, Myriad pledged to grant open research access to its then-patented genes, balking only at use by fee-charging labs.",

Going back further in time to when living organisms became patentable, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) began to require deposits of the material if necessary to assure availability to the public to satisfy the disclosure requirement. Under patent law: \"Every patent must contain a written description of the invention sufficient to enable a person skilled in the art to which the invention pertains to make and use the invention. Where the invention involves a biological material and words alone cannot sufficiently describe how to make and use the invention in a reproducible manner, access to the biological material may be necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for patentability under 35 U.S.C. Section 112.\" (USPTO 2014).",

Much of the technology I had been using was publicly known because the inventors could protect their right. Much of it would have remained secret if this had been the case.\" (Potrykus 2011).

And so it is with the basic plant transformation technology patents-the \"gene gun\" (#6004287) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (#4658082). Both are now in the public domain, although some improvements remain under patent. This kind of broad pioneering patent grant is unlikely to be repeated in the biotech field due to an attribute of the US patent system which treats a patent as the right of an inventor. It is thus the responsibility of the USPTO (the assigned examiner) to document why a patent should be withheld, typically meaning the application is either nonnovel and/or nonobvious . What happens in new fields of endeavor-as biotechnology was in the 1980s-is that most applications by definition are nonobvious. To document lack of novelty, the examiner must identify a publication or use or related patent, which destroys the novelty. Again, in new fields of research, there are limited numbers of such documents so lack of novelty is difficult to establish. The consequence is broad patent grants. The situation, though, is self-correcting since time provides more evidence for examiners to reject or narrow patent grants.",

A partnership between the NIH and Burroughs Wellcome, however, led to Burroughs Wellcome receiving six patents for the production and use of AZT, initially pricing the drug at $7000-$10,000 annually per patient. Due to pushback by the government, two 20% price reductions were instituted in 1987 and 1989, but lawsuits by firms seeking to overturn the patents for lack of inventorship by Burroughs Wellcome-asserting that the NIH and Duke researchers were the true inventors-were eventually unsuccessful.

            "text": "While strong, the results have several caveats. One is that Celera's ownership was based not on patents-which was the focus of Heller and Eisenberg's (1998) concerns-but instead was based on \"contract law-based IP.\" Second, the analysis is based during the biotech boom, when the demand for prompt access to data and ownership rights could justify the willingness of major private firms to pay $5-$15 million annually for access to materials they knew would be entering the public domain in a few years. At a minimum, the uniqueness of the situation makes it more difficult to generalize the results. The author explains the outcome as a result of transaction costs, including the uncertainties over Celera's attempts to patent the genes it had sequenced and the conditions of granting free access to academic researchers for \"noncommercial\" research. And because Celera used a different sequencing technique from the public-sector researchers, Celera's involvement is often credited with speeding up the entire sequencing process. These are limited examples; more useful evidence is surveys of researchers' experiences. Cho et al. (2003) surveyed 127 directors of clinical genetic testing services, concluding that \"virtually all laboratory directors felt that patents have had a negative effect on all aspects of clinical testing, except on the quality of testing\" (p. 5). The ability to conduct research decreased modestly. However, it is important to recognize that the respondents (all but one) were involved in genetic testing for clinical (fee based) rather than research purposes. It is unsurprising that patent holders prevented that group from using patented technologies with no charge and thwarted the development of alternative tests. Walsh et al. (2003) contacted 70 attorneys, business managers, and scientists from universities and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms for in-depth personal interviews. Their focus was the more extreme forms of access restriction. They first addressed the sheer number of patents potentially burdening research, a factor identified by Heller and Eisenberg (1998) when citing 100 patents termed \"adrenergic receptor.\" Respondents, however, saw matters differently. Only a \"small number\" of licenses were found to be required-13 in the final analysis. Generally complicated cases involved 6-12 key patents, but the \"more typical number was zero\" (p. 294). Jenson and Murray (2005) though found that \"some genes have up to 20 patents asserting rights to various gene uses and manifestations\" (p. 239) suggesting additional FTO issues for researchers.",

Adelman and DeAngelis (2007, p.1729 ) examined 50,000+ biotech patents over the period of 1990-2004 for trends in numbers and ownership. They concluded that \"the lack of concentrated control, the rising number of patent applications, and the continuous influx of new patent owners suggest that overall biotechnology innovation is not being impaired by the growth in patents issued each year.\" Holman (2007) approached the issue from the perspective of human gene patents that had been litigated. The author carefully notes that infringement actions are not the sole measure of negative effects of patents-the payment of royalties would be an obvious one-but nonetheless provide an objective measure of the degree to which patent rights are asserted. Four categories of human gene patents are identified: (1) recombinant production of human therapeutic proteins, (2) research tools, (3) genetic testing products and services, and (4) gene therapy. Of the 4270 gene patents previously identified, only 18 were found to have been involved in six infringement actions. This is a litigation rate of 0.4%, far below the 1%-2% for all patents. Of the six actions, four were settled privately, one dismissed for lack of standing by the plaintiff, and one determined to be non-infringing. That is, not a single human gene patent had been determined by the courts to have been infringing. Access to research tools is of particular relevance to researchers, and all but seven infringement actions were identified in this manner. Citing a relationship between the level of litigation frequency and non-litigation impact, the author \"find[s] that the impact of human gene patent litigation has been relatively modest [which] suggests that non-litigation impact is not as extensive as commonly perceived\" (p. 359).",

Rather, they highlight a problem of lack of transparency and clarity, leading to legal uncertainty\" (Huys et al. 2009, p. 909) .

Simply stated, that emperor is scantily clad. Contributing factors mitigating the anticommons potential are changes in patent-granting practices, use by firms of nonexclusive licenses for research tools, and the facility of simple material transfer agreements used by academic researchers. In many cases, industry and academics developed \"working solutions\" under which research access is facilitated for noncommercial purposes. \"The fact of the matter is that academic researchers who are not engaged in research for commercial use are not affected by the existence of a patent. Biotech companies do not sue researchers who are conducting research for purely academic purposes\" (Feldbaum 2002, p. 1) .",

These observations, though, are about the past, and \"though fears that gene patents could stifle research have not been borne out, for the most part, commentators are now raising questions about how the many existing gene patents might be used in the future\" (Cook-Deegan 2008, p. 71) . So what can be done? Two legislative remedies were attempted in the 2000s. One-the Genomic Research and Diagnostic Accessibility Act of 2002-was a \"limited exemption from liability for certain uses of patented genetic sequences and genetic sequence information in the context of basic research and genetic diagnostic information\" (Holman 2007, p. 295) . The bill was not acted on by Congress and was not reintroduced when the introducing representative left office. The second would bar the patenting of any nucleotide sequence, or its functions or correlations, or the naturally occurring products it specifies (the Genomic Research and Accessibility Act of 2007). This language is very broad and ambiguous, potentially encompassing all inventions involving polynucleotides (Holman 2007) . The bill never made it out of committee. Congressional action to control patent trolls has met a similar fate. Following a yearlong effort, the process was declared all but dead when patent reform was withdrawn from the Senate Judiciary Committee's agenda in May 2014 (Wyatt 2014) . These experiences strongly suggest any legislative remedy is off the table for the foreseeable future.",

From their assessment of 50,000 patents in the biotechnology complex, Adelman and DeAngelis (2007, p. 1729) were able to say that their analysis \"also reveals the many pitfalls of seeking to resolve this question at a synoptic level using simple metrics. In this sense, both the advocates of the anticommons theory and enthusiasts of patent characteristics err by oversimplifying the multidimensional character of patent dynamics.\" Further, commentators on the anticommons oftentimes mix the issues of the commercialization of products incorporating patented genes and testing methods with the effect of patents on research access. For example, the patent and related rights issues surrounding Golden Rice related to commercial use, not research access, did not restrict product development (see above). Both topics are worthy of discussion, but they are not the same issue and should not be conflated. And the issue with Celera's IP of certain human gene sequences (see above) was based on contract, not patent, law. The consequences of the two may be similar, but a policy remedy would require an entirely different approach.",
