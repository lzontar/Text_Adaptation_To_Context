Through the integration of distinct methodological strategies, WHAM was developed in the period from 2011 to 2018, in a workers' occupational health centre in the oil industry in Bahia, Brazil. The study included a sample of 965 workers, 91.7% of which were men, with a mean age of 44.9 years (age ranged from 23 to 73 years). The Kendall rank correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used for the validation of WHAM. The assessment of sustainable return on investment (S-ROI) was made using the WELLCAST ROI\u2122 decision support tool, covering workers with heart disease and diabetes. WHAM can be considered an innovative healthcare model, as there is no available comparative model. WHAM is considered robust, with 86% health risk explanatory capacity and with an 85.5% S-ROI. It can be concluded that WHAM is a model capable of enhancing the level of workers' health in companies, reducing costs for employers and improving the quality of life within the organization.

The result of this diversity of terms is the already identified difficulty in conceptualizing assistance models. Healthcare assistance models are understood as technological combinations with different purposes, which are used to solve problems and meet needs within a given context and population and in a given territory (individuals, groups, or communities), to organize health services or to intervene in situations, depending on the epidemiological profile and investigation of health problems and risks [12] .

In this process, the daily requirements in the health sector stand out, such as the relationships between people; the involvement and co-responsibility of managers, health professionals, and patients in healthcare; as well as the bond, reception, and humanization of healthcare assistance practices [15] . From a technological point of view, there is a predominance of the use of the so-called \"hard technologies\" (equipment), to the detriment of light technologies (professional-patient relationships) [8, 16] . Thus, diagnostic tests are a priority, but patients are not necessarily considered in terms of their suffering. This approach has been the target of criticism at the international level, starting from the 1970s and gaining greater importance in the second half of the 1980s [11, 17] . In terms of the biomedical model, there is a certain neglect of the importance of the determinants of the health-disease process; that is, the focus on the disease and not on the elements that contribute to health promotion, underestimating that cultural, ethical, and social aspects condition lifestyles and that these are also determinants in the same process [13, 14, 18] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 19, "end": 23, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 517, "end": 521, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 721, "end": 724, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 725, "end": 728, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1013, "text": "17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1382, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1386, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1387, "end": 1390, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature Review"}, {"text": "Merhy [8] contributes to the debate about the need to change the hegemonic assistance model, arguing that it is necessary to impact the core of care.

Thus, light technologies are used and combined with people and resources to achieve certain objectives, which are gathered in an organized manner and consolidated as essential elements of health services [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 6, "end": 9, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 596, "end": 600, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature Review"}, {"text": "Regardless of the scope, health services are always complex. The processes are standardized by regulatory bodies, service providers, and class representatives, among others. They have highly specialized and qualified workers who, belonging to different class councils, have interests that do not always converge [20] . Team composition characteristics in health services must be highlighted, recognizing these team members as the main actors responsible for the implementation of technologies aligned to a healthcare assistance model. Faria [21] draws attention to the fact that actions performed in a given place to deal with a certain problem may not apply to other situations, considering the historical-political context that influences a situation. Therefore, the use of healthcare assistance models invariably requires the selection of certain constructs that support them. Thus, they can be used in an alternative or adapted way, as long as they enable the achievement of similar results. To incorporate new health needs, healthcare assistance models can be considered to have influenced the organization of care models, being more focused on specific populations, such as the chronically ill. A comprehensive care model defines how health services are offered, providing the best care and service practices for a person or population group as they evolve through a condition, injury, or event, aiming for people to receive the right care, at the right time, by the right team, and in the right place [22] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 312, "end": 316, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 541, "end": 545, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1512, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature Review"}, {"text": "The field of occupational health is a fertile environment for the development of interdisciplinary practices [23] [24] [25] [26] , as it encompasses knowledge from different disciplines, requiring constant and complex interactions between professionals in the fields of epidemiology, the environment, engineering, and healthcare, among others. The framing of occupational health in a biomedical healthcare assistance model favours the development of disjointed and ineffective interventions regarding the needs presented by workers, while the biopsychosocial model is often used in their work environments. According to Annadale [27] , the biomedical healthcare assistance model only focuses on the physical processes, i.e., the pathology, biochemistry, and physiology of a disease, neglecting the roles of social factors or individual subjectivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 113, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 114, "end": 118, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 119, "end": 123, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 629, "end": 633, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature Review"}, {"text": "In this context, it is necessary to discuss a model of assistance in occupational health that is capable of reviewing the central characteristics of the biomedical healthcare assistance model, including: (i) organization of practices focused on the identification of signs and symptoms and the treatment of diseases, with health promotion not being a priority; (ii) assistance is organized based on individual spontaneous demand, with an emphasis on specialization and the use of hard technologies; (iii) the work is developed in a fragmented, hierarchical manner and with inequality across different professional categories; (iv) difficulty in implementing the integrated care due to the lack of understanding of the individual as a multidimensional human being, as well as the lack of communication and integration between the services involved; (v) health planning is seldom used as a management tool; (vi) the training of health professionals is specialized, based on the hegemony of scientific knowledge; and (vii) themes such as interdisciplinary, people-centered care, attachment, and welcoming are not prioritized. Another aspect of great relevance in the current global context of scarcity of resources, particularly in the current context of COVID-19, is the prioritization of investments ineffective, integral, and integrated interventions, which can be achieved through a model that contemplates the management of occupational health risks, considering the social health determinants [28, 29] , global disease burden [30] , environmental aspects [31, 32] , sustainable development goals [33, 34] and in particular, working conditions that affect an individual's health [35] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1496, "end": 1500, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1504, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1529, "end": 1533, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1566, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1603, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1604, "end": 1607, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1685, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature Review"}, {"text": "In the current context, the effectiveness of a healthcare assistance model must include economic sustainability in addition to health gains, to know how much the company has earned due to investments made in a certain area, with the sustainable return on investment (S-ROI) being a very important metric for this assessment. Measuring the S-ROI [36] [37] [38] of preventive programs is not an easy task, due to the large number of variables that influence this calculation. The main variable is patient health, which can improve or worsen unpredictably. Analyzing the S-ROI in preventive programs identifies the financial impact a program generates concerning the amount invested, which must be considered in the long term. Disease prevention actions bring future returns, mainly to the reduction of healthcare assistance costs. If the individual participates in preventive programs, the probability of developing diseases or discovering them in advanced stages decreases. Over the past 20 years, several studies [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] have addressed this issue and there is growing evidence that workplace programs can generate acceptable financial returns for employers investing in them. A study of Johnson and Johnson employees [39] showed a difference in the increase in the average annual costs of internment between workers involved and not involved in lifestyle improvement programs and changes in the workplace, representing $43 and $76, respectively, thus representing a considerable increase in percentage terms. The study by Munir et al. [45] aimed to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the stand more at work (SMArT) workplace intervention, designed to reduce sitting time. A net saving of $2.18813 (95% CI; $\u22124.3804; $4.8143) per employee was found as a result of productivity increase. Peik and others [46] applied the Research and Development (RAND) Europe model, a program designed to expand access to up to 40 evidence-based clinical preventive services for all employees and eligible family members, as part of a unique global health initiative at the country level to estimate the return on investment over a five-year timeframe. The study concluded that this program generates a global return of $4.28-$11.88 (after investment cost). Gao and co-workers [47] assessed the economic performance of a workplace-delivered intervention to reduce sitting time among desk-based workers. The incremental cost-efficacy ratios ranged from $6.28/minute reduction in workplace sitting time to $8.45/minute reduction in overall sitting time. The intervention was cost-effective over the lifetime of the cohort when scaled up to the national workforce, and provides important evidence for policy-makers and workplaces regarding the allocation of resources to reduce workplace sitting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 345, "end": 349, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 350, "end": 354, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 355, "end": 359, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1017, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1022, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1023, "end": 1027, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1032, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1037, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1047, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1052, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1057, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1258, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1576, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1839, "end": 1843, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2300, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature Review"}, {"text": "The present study was carried out from 2011 to 2018, in a workers' occupational healthcare centre in the oil industry in Bahia, Brazil.

Based on an approach aimed at changing behaviors and adopting healthier lifestyles, going beyond the mere medicalization or treatment of diseases, the interdisciplinary care on which the WHAM model is based resulted in the data presented in Table 2 . In view of the most prevalent diagnoses identified for each of the integrated dimensions, an intervention was generated that promotes worker autonomy and the maintenance of healthy lifestyles and behaviors, such as physical activity, healthy eating, non-consumption of alcohol and tobacco, good oral hygiene, balanced social and environmental relations, and decent work habits [55] . At this level, hypertension or diabetes mellitus diagnosis is highlighted, suggesting healthy behaviors or healthier eating habits interventions. As Eng and collaborators [59] state, the workplace is a key space for guidance around healthy behaviors and the reduction of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension. Viterbo and co-authors [23] report that long-term interdisciplinary practice has had very positive and significant effects on reducing NCDs. Hochart and Lang [60] also mention in their study that the implementation of a comprehensive care program in the workplace with the aim of modifying health risk behaviors resulted in a decrease in workers in the high and medium risk ranges and in the maintenance of health for those that were in the low risk range. The same is true for the issue of oral health, a problem that is related to other serious diseases [61, 62] , and which is solved through the implementation of regular programs for the adoption of oral hygiene behavior among workers, as reported by Viterbo and collaborators [63] . Supporting these results, and in order to reinforce the importance of an integral look at workers' health, Table 3 presents the results between the behaviors (modifiable factors) and the results for workers' health. An overview of these results makes the connections between behaviors and health outcomes even more evident, as well as between the results themselves. In this case, an individual look at a worker would not allow one to understand them as a whole, contributing to fragmentation. Certain associations exemplify this idea, namely between the level of food knowledge and the type of food, identified by the energy balance intake, altered blood glucose, and diabetes mellitus. A similar relationship was identified in a review by Sami and co-authors [64] , in which guidance towards healthier eating practices reduced the level of diabetes and prevented associated complications. The study by Holynska and colleagues [65] showed that the level of food knowledge is effectively related to nutrient intake, as this study also demonstrated. In line with this, Breen et al. [66] argued that the level of food knowledge enhances the choice of food, thus optimizing the quality of life of people with diabetes. Table 4 shows the results of the indicators that are most correlated with the risk of each analyzed dimension, making it possible to identify those that contribute most to the increased risk in that dimension. The strongest correlation belongs to the field of dentistry, more specifically for oral lesions increasing the health risk of these workers. According to Warnakulasuriya et al. [67] , conducting screening programs using valid visual inspection method to detect potentially malignant oral disorders within a workplace is not only feasible, but also effective. In terms of physical activity, the indicator that has the strongest correlation is that of the contemplation stage for physical activity; that is, the predisposition to start a physical activity. In the review by Jirathananuwat and Pongpirul [68] , the 48 studies analyzed demonstrated that the workplace can play an important role in promoting regular physical activity among workers. Ergonomic risks in the workplace are, in this context, assumed to be the most correlated with risk in the field of nursing. This has been documented in several studies, namely by Skovlund et al. [69] and Welch et al. [70] . Since workers spend long hours of their day at the workplace, an additional concern regarding workplace ergonomics must be considered, as correct adaptation will result not only in promoting the well-being of workers, but also in reducing medical costs for employers, as reported by Munir et al. [45] , Gao et al. [47] , and Welch et al. [70] . In terms of pathologies, diabetes mellitus is the indicator that most contributes to risk in the dimension of medicine.
