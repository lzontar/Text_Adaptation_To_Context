Positive results in both these height ranges possibly pointed to an in-falling microbial population, and this came as an unwelcome surprise in the years running up to the dawn of the space age.

In addition to structures such as shown in Fig. 2A , which were presumed to be bacteria, the stratospheric samples from 2001 also revealed evidence of similar-sized bacterial clumps that could not be cultured but were detected by the use of a fluorescent dye (carbocyanine dye).
