Later on, The World Health Organization (WHO) named this pathogenic virus for 2019-nCoV. 2, 3 The pathogenic virus is a member of a large group of highly diverse viruses called coronaviruses, it is an enveloped virus that is composed of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA as its genetic material. 4 On March 11, 2020, WHO has declared COVID-19 as pandemic disease and by March 26, 2020 , COVID-19 has spread to nearly 199 countries and territories worldwide with more than 462680 cases and approximately 20834 deaths. 5 So far, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infects humans. In the last two decades, two epidemic severe human diseases have emerged and they were attributed to two novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Respectively; both viruses have infected more than 8000 and 857 cases worldwide with mortality rates around 10% and 35%. 5",

Less common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis. 11,15e17 According to Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 6) that was released by the National Health Commission & State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, patients can be classified into four categories (i.e. mild, moderate, severe and critical). Patients in the mild group have mild symptoms with no radiologic findings of pneumonia. Moderate cases Show fever and respiratory symptoms with radiological findings of pneumonia. Severely diseased patients have dyspnea, tachypnea (i.e. respiratory rate 30/min), hypoxemia (i.e. blood oxygen saturation 93%) and lung infiltrates >50% within 24e48 h.

Some patients have an elevated lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine kinase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. Lymphopenia is considered a cardinal feature of this disease. Approximately 30% of patients had an abnormally elevated D-Dimer level. Even serum levels of procalcitonin were normal in most patients, the C-reactive protein was elevated. 4, 11, 14 Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest in patients with COVID-19 has characteristic manifestations related to different clinical types of the disease (i.e. mild, moderate, severe and critical). There were no abnormal CT findings in mild cases. Moderate cases are mainly manifested as solid plaque shadow and halo sign (i.e. ground glass opacity surrounding a pulmonary nodule or mass); these changes have been identified in 91% of cases. Severe cases show fibrous strip shadow with ground glass changes; multiple lesions documented in more than 95% of cases. Consolidation shadow as the main lesion is the main finding in critically ill patients. 18 Detection of viral RNA using real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. For the most sensitive detection of 2019-nCoV, the collection and testing of both upper and lower respiratory samples are recommended. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens have the highest positive rates 93%, followed by sputum 72%. Nasal swabs, fiber bronchoscope brush biopsy, and pharyngeal swabs detection rates are 63%, 46%, and 32%. Both fecal and blood specimens have positive rates in only 29% and 1% of diseased patients. Regardless the high detection rates in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum, The US CDC recommends collecting only the upper respiratory nasopharyngeal (NP) swab because of the increase in biosafety risk to healthcare workers through the creation of aerosol droplets. 19e21",

Because of that, the daily assessment of personnel health status and recording body temperature should be implemented.

AGPs include and not limited to intubation, extubation, chest tube insertion, bronchoscopy, bag masking, gastrointestinal endoscopy, laparoscopy and the use of energy devices (e.g. electrocautery). When using electrocautery or other energy devices in surgery, adjust to the lowest effective power possible to reduce the amount of surgical smoke, and use a smoking evacuator. 22, 27 The choice between laparoscopy and laparotomy as a surgical approach needs to be cautious. As the use of laparoscopy was proved to have advantages, patients with good cardiopulmonary function and general condition can be considered for laparoscopic surgery. Careful attention during pneumoperitoneum creation and strict aerosol management must be made even during the operation. 22, 27 In response to artificial pneumoperitoneum, there will be a reduction in lung volume, increased airway pressure, increase CO2 retention, and decreased lung compliance. Therefore, the risk of perioperative infection 2019-nCoV is considered high. 28 To minimize the impact of pneumoperitoneum on lung function, circulation and susceptibility for pathogen infection, both intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure, and CO2 ventilation should be at the lowest possible. Surgical smoke and pneumoperitoneum should be evacuated only using a direct suction connected to a vacuum suction unit. 27 ",
