Certified and ideally preliminary face fitted respiratory PPE should always be used when available. Proof of airtightness alone is no proof of real-life protection from hazardous aerosols. We surveyed for several subjective comfort evaluations, but participants wore the different respirators only for several minutes which does not reflect a realistic wearing duration. However, the current state of emergency and potential lack of certified PPE inspired us to realize this study, to give HCW some clarity on the matter in order to aid them in their own risk assessment, when being forced to look for alternatives.",

While anaesthesia face masks are easily assembled with available components in hospitals, snorkelling masks have to be acquired additionally and must undergo carefully executed, significant modifications. Special attention needs to be paid when choosing an adequate filter. Our results suggest that those alternative respirators should be further investigated, as they seem to be viable alternatives for situations when certified PPE is not available. Individual face fit testing should be used to guide HCW in choosing the respirator best adapted to their facial morphology.",

There was no difference between both ADR in passing QNFT (P = 1.00).All these evaluations have been reanalysed without the two specific HCW tasks, considering only the first seven conventional exercises as defined by the OSHA. In this setup, 26 out of 70 (37%) exercises measured iFF below 100 in the FFP2 control group. This was the case in 9 out of 70 (13%) exercises within the AFM group and in 5 out of 70 (7%) exercises within the MSM group. Successful QNFT results following gFF calculation increased from 5 out of 10 in the 9exercises FFP2 group to 7 out of 10 in the 7-exercises group (P = 0.69). No changes between each of the ADR groups were observed.The results of the survey are represented inFig. 3. Vision was evaluated significantly impaired with the MSM respirator compared to the FFP2 (P = 0.031). No significant difference was found in the survey between the FFP2 and AFM respirator.
