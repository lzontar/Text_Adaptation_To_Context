            "text": "Wearable devices digitally measuring vital signs have been used for monitoring health and illness onset and have high potential for real-time monitoring and disease detection. As such they are potentially useful during public health crises, such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Using smartwatch data from 31 infected individuals identified from a cohort of over 5000 participants, we investigated the use of wearables for early, presymptomatic detection of COVID-19. From physiological and activity data, we first demonstrate that COVID-19 infections are associated with alterations in heart rate, steps and sleep in 80% of COVID-19 infection cases. Failure to detect these changes in the remaining patients often occurred in those with chronic respiratory/lung disease. Importantly the physiological alterations were detected prior to, or at, symptom onset in over 85% of the positive cases (21/24), in some cases nine or more days before symptoms. Through daily surveys we can track physiological changes with symptom onset and severity. Finally, we develop a method to detect onset of COVID-19 infection in real-time which detects 67% of infection cases at or before symptom onset. Our study provides a roadmap to a rapid and universal diagnostic method for the large-scale detection of respiratory viral infections in advance of symptoms, highlighting a useful approach for managing epidemics using digital tracking and health monitoring.",

Active infections are currently tracked using PCR assays, which may require up to three days post-infection for a reliable positive signal 1 . In addition, the test is not generally utilized on a daily basis. Moreover, since most infections become apparent only upon symptom onset, the current methods of testing cannot identify presymptomatic carriers, which is a significant challenge for the implementation of early stage interventions that reduce transmission.

We applied a nonparametric approach 14 to test whether the sequence of standardized residuals is a homogeneous process. Under the significance level 0.05, the elevated regions were reported as abnormal RHR periods (Supplementary Table 5 ). 2). In the anomaly detection method (HROS-AD), we created a new feature known as HROS (Heart Rate Over Steps) by dividing heart rate with steps data and compare HROS at each hourly interval with the rest of the intervals using Gaussian density estimation 15, 16 . Prior to the comparison, we smoothed and standardized the HROS (see Methods). Using Gaussian density estimation, we computed an anomaly score for each observation and classified them as normal (1) or anomaly (-1) with an outlier threshold of 0.1 (see Methods, Supplementary Table 6 ). Analyses were performed on all the data available for each individual, including data collected before, during, and after the reported illness. A method similar to HROS-AD, RHR-AD (based on resting heart rate, see Methods) produced similar results (Supplementary Tables 7, 10 ).",

Data from reported respiratory rates and blood oxygen is expected to be particularly useful in COVID-19 prediction 27 . At the time of this writing, such data was not available to us; however, such data, along with increased participant size, will greatly improve diagnostics.
