Background: Growing number of confirmed and deaths cases from the coronavirus worldwide, particularly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, has resulted concerns about the future of these countries and their deterioration. Also the European region is likely to face more casualties due to the delay in the virus reaching most of its regions and, of course, as the trend continues. Methods: We conducted a simulation in both current and ideal situation for the next month to predict the death rate and examine the reason for the difference in Italy, Iran and South Korea individually. If we assume the cultural and political factors and age pyramids distribution are similar across regions, the differences are mainly due either to the heavier health-care burden owing to the larger population or to the medical facilities diversities. Results: Our results for Italy showed higher death number, but the rate would be more for Iran. South Korea is also expected to have a smaller increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths compared to Iran and Italy by the next month. Conclusion: Given the prevailing conditions around the world and the increasing number of casualties, it is essential that all countries, especially those with fewer days of involvement, shall do their best to avoid major losses and damages.",

Given the growing importance of the issue, the World Health Organization has collected and disseminated a wealth of coronavirus information on confirmed, recovered, and death cases. The information is available on RamiKrispin dataset (4) as of January 22, 2020 and is updated daily. At a glance, people whom as new confirmed or recovered or death cases are entered daily, forming a queue system (5) . In fact, every new confirmed person who comes in daily, after a while, either recovers or dies. With the exception of China, where the outbreak began,  Italy, Iran and South Korea were the countries with the  highest number of confirmed cases and deaths with far  differences from the other countries (especially in Italy  and Iran, up to March 15) and also had the highest number of days of involvement with the virus compared to most countries. The differences in the number of deaths could be due to the large number of confirmations that could be considered an indirect indicator of the heavier health-care burden on these countries (6) . This subject proposed by the study of Yu et al. (7) on the unevenness of the distribution of highquality health-care resources in different provinces and cities of China. The main purpose of the current study was to estimate the number of confirmed cases and the rate of death and also to investigate the cause of death in the most prevalent countries in the next month. Accordingly, we conducted a simulation study to predict the possibly future situation using the current situation in Italy, Iran and South Korea.",
