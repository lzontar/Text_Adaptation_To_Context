The presence of some hepatocyte mitoses and of numerous ceroid macrophages indicated that hepatitis had been ongoing for a while already. 3 There was no evidence of endotheliitis or hemophagocytosis, and there was no sinusoidal fibrin deposition. The more striking histological feature was the presence of numerous ground-glass hepatocytes with weakly eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions of various size, showing round or reniform shape and sharp edges ( Fig. 2A) . Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative (Fig. 2B) , as well as immunochemistry for hepatitis B surface antigen (not illustrated). The cytoplasmic inclusions strongly reacted with an anti-fibrinogen antibody (Fig.   2C ), demonstrating that they were composed mainly of fibrinogen. They were also positive, in a patchy pattern, for C-reactive protein (not illustrated). Immunochemistry for CMV was negative; PCR for CMV in the tissue was only weakly positive (200 copies/ml). At electron microscopy, the inclusions contained a homogenous, moderately electron dense granular material (Fig. 2D ). They were delineated, at least focally, by a membrane, arguing in favor of dilated endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2E) . Hence, the morphological picture suggested hepatocellular type II fibrinogen inclusions (1).",

They are observed in Lafora's disease, type IV glycogenosis and cyanamide aversion therapy in alcoholic patients (2) , and have also been more recently described as \"polyglucosan-like\" hepatocellular inclusions in patients under polypharmacotherapy (3). In our patient, the ground glass inclusions were PAS negative, which prompted us to think of the possibility of abnormal fibrinogen accumulation, confirmed by the strong immunohistochemical reaction with an antifibrinogen antibody, and by the electron microscopy feature of membrane-bound inclusions (1, 2). 4 Fibrinogen is a large, oligomeric glycoprotein complex produced in the liver and secreted into the blood. Fibrinogen A\u03b1, B\u03b2 and \u03b3 chains are encoded by the FGA, FGB and FGG genes, respectively. These are located on chromosome 4 and expressed almost exclusively in hepatocytes. Fibrinogen is converted by thrombin to fibrin, the most abundant component of a blood clot (4) (5) . Plasma fibrinogen levels are increased by mediators of the acute-phase inflammatory response, e.g. IL-6, or may be decreased as a result of consumption in disseminated intravascular coagulation. On the other side, mutations in fibrinogen genes cause congenital disorders that are typically associated with a-, hypo-, and/or dysfibrinogenemia (6) . In rare cases, a few mutations clustered in exons 8-9 of FGG result in the intracellular accumulation of misfolded fibrinogen in hepatocytes, chronic liver disease of various severity, and hypofibrinogenemia (7) . Of note, fibrinogen storage disease without hypofibrinogenemia, which corresponds to the clinical picture presented by our patient, has rarely been associated with acute infections in patients without any hereditary defect of fibrinogen (8-9).",

Based on the temporal relationships, none of the administered drugs could be unequivocally linked to ALT increase. However, it is possible that one of them or another as yet unidentified extrinsic or intrinsic factor impaired 5 fibrinogen secretion and contributed to intrahepatic accumulation as a \"second hit\". Of note, hydroxychloroquine impacts on lysosomal function, autophagy and the Golgi apparatus (20) (21) . Although our patient had been treated with hydroxychloroquine for only two days, one may speculate that this may have contributed to pathological hepatic accumulation of fibrinogen. A direct viral effect is less likely given the negative PCR results on nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage performed 10 days and four days prior to liver biopsy, respectively. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to circulate systemically at relevant levels (22) .",
