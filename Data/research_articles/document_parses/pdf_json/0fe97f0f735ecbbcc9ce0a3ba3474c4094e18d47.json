As measures for cleaning and sanitizing, DGS recommends disinfecting the whole store area at least once a day; and frequently cleaning (at all hours) the high-touch surfaces, such as ticket dispenser machines or ATMs. Moreover, alcohol-based solutions should be provided in strategic locations. 3 This observational study aims to describe the measures adopted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 by retail food stores in the municipality of Braga, Portugal.",
