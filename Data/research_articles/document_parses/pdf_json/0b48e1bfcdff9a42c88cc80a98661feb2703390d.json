From the posterior 112 distributions on decay slope parameters we computed posterior distributions for the half-life of each virus 113 in each condition (Figure 2B,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "are a number of potential factors which could account for the epidemiological differences 128 between the two viruses. There have been early indications that individuals infected with HCoV-19 may 129 shed and transmit the virus while pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic 4,18-20 . This reduces the efficacy of 130 quarantine and contact tracing as control measures relative to SARS-CoV-1. 21 Other factors likely to play 131 a role include the infectious dose required to establish an infection, the stability of virus in mucus, and 132 environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity. 16,22 In ongoing experiments, we are 133 studying virus viability in different matrices, such as nasal secretion, sputum and fecal matter, and while 134 varying environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity. 135 The epidemiology of SARS-CoV-1 was dominated by nosocomial transmission and SARS-CoV 136 was detected on variety of surfaces and objects in healthcare settings. 9 HCoV-19 transmission is also 137 occurring in hospital settings, with over 3000 reported cases of hospital-acquired infections. 23 These cases 138 highlight the vulnerability of healthcare settings for introduction and spread of HCoV-19. 10 However, in 139 contrast to SARS-CoV-1, most secondary transmission has been reported outside healthcare settings 23 and 140 widespread transmission in the community is being seen in several settings, such as households, 141 workplace and group gatherings. 142 A notable feature of SARS-CoV-1 was super-spreading events, in which a single infected 143 individual was responsible for a large number of secondary cases, well above the average number denoted 144 by the reproduction number R eff . 7-11,20 A tendency toward such super-spreading events has two important 145 consequences for the epidemiology of emerging infections: it makes any given introduction of infection 146 for use under a CC0 license.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "154Here, we show that the stability of HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 under the experimental 155 circumstances tested is similar.
