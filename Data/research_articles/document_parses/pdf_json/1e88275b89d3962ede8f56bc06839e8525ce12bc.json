The flipped classroom has been recently emphasized in nursing education and may be an especially appropriate model to consider during a transition to the online learning environment. This setting differs from the traditional classroom in which faculty introduces the course content, which students subsequently reinforce through reading and assignments. In a flipped classroom, there is increased emphasis on student-based learning as the initial exposure to course material (Betihavas, Bridgman, Kornhaber, & Cross, 2016) . The faculty member will provide additional opportunities for knowledge building, application or skill development. Bergmann and Sams (2012; emphasized several benefits of a flipped classroom that may be extended to remote learning. One key advantage is students may progress through the material at their own pace and then virtual class time may be focused on content the student found challenging and on application and higher order cognitive processes. Another benefit specific to the pandemic environment is augmentation of missed instruction. Practicing nurses and advanced practice nurses may not be able to participate in virtual live lectures due to work, family, or their own health needs. Additionally, faculty may also not be able to host live lectures for the same reasons. Thus, the flipped classroom supports student-centered pedagogy.",

These challenges can be mitigated by providing clear guidelines and communication tools (Monsivais & Robbins, 2017) . For example, many online platforms (including Blackboard Collaborate) have opportunities for break-out sessions. Fostering group assignments in online learning may be especially appropriate J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f at this time, as they have the potential to foster camaraderie and increase engagement during periods of social distancing. One such example is the use of peer buddies. Having a student peer buddy for written assignment peer review and social support can be instrumental in student success and overall satisfaction. Faculty may allow students to select their own peer buddies or may be assign collaborations, which helps to reduce isolation that may occur with social distancing.",

Asynchronous discussions using a video response format provide the opportunity for faculty and students to remain both socially and cognitive connected while physically off campus. Presence is further enhanced through the ability to connect beyond written communication. The ability to visually see and hear each other allows for visualization of nonverbal communication as well as verbal communication nuisances that far surpass written only communication. Learning management systems, such as Canvas (www.canvas.net), have built in functionality allowing both students and faculty to post video responses directly into the discussion board forum. Direct posting of video responses reduces the need to upload MP4 files that tend to be large in size and can take up to an hour to upload. The internet will be taxed with increased usage, so it is not recommended to use manual video uploads to the discussion board. Canvas has smartphone and tablet applications which allow for increased flexibility in posting from anywhere. Flipgrid (https://info.flipgrid.com/) is a cloud-based asynchronous platform that allows for video discussions that are behind a password protected firewall. Students may download the smartphone or tablet app and post video responses from anywhere. The mobile flexibility allows practicing nurse to post from anywhere. Flipgrid also works on computers which have a webcam and microphone. In the faculty dashboard, faculty can sort by student, download an excel file to ensure all posts are included in the grading process, and post video responses to students.

One of the top concerns during the COVID-19 crisis has been ensuring students receive appropriate clinical hours, as many health care facilities have curtailed programs. With limited access to health care facilities, nursing programs may consider simulation instruction as an alternative. However, use of traditional mannequin-based simulators may not be an option during a period of social distancing. In this case, programs may consider web-based simulation for advanced practice programs (LeFlor & Thomas, 2016) . Several cloudbased simulation products may be used to provide develop and enhance clinical reasoning. Two examples are EHR Go and NovEx. EHR Go (https://ehrgo.com/ ) has more than 600 simulated case studies. Many include clinical documentation in the EHR Go simulated electronic health record and are well suited for interprofessional education. Faculty may set up cases easily and adapt to specific course and learning outcomes. NovEx (http://novicetoexpert.org/a-homepagesection/novex-experience/ ) is based on the work of Dr. Patricia Benner, Dr. Tom Ahrens, and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Dr. Patricia Hooper Kyriakidis. The sophisticated clinical reasoning and judgment simulations allow faculty to visualize the student thought process as well as observe clicks and actions taken throughout the case. NovEx also has the capacity to identify sentinel events related to patient safety and flag students who may require remediation. Across all virtual platforms, it is vital to ensure the concept of CaringFidelity TM is imparted to students along with technical competencies and skills, so that graduate nursing students are able to implement into practice the real-life processes of reflection, contemplation, and action (Christopher, in press) .",

Nevertheless, it is important for all faculty to understand that this is a new and evolving situation for all.

Students may be experiencing increased demands from work or other pressures influencing a potential lapse in judgment. Maintaining faculty accessibility and clear expectations of student responsibilities are essential in promoting an ethical environment. Academic leaders, departments, and program chairs should promote psychological safety for faculty as they may be new to many of these advanced technologies and learning management systems. Partnerships with university departments, such as information technology and centers of academic excellence, are vital in supporting the transformation of graduate nursing education to a remote learning model. Use of faculty who are considered super users may further augment university and departmental resources to support faculty as they learn to use and implement remote learning pedagogy and practices while ensuring accessibility to all students. Furthering such partnerships will need to support students as they transition from traditional face to face classroom settings to remote learning formats. The common thread present throughout these elements is that nursing schools must continue to support the education and safety of all students. Despite the logistical challenges, graduate nursing students will continue to thrive, driven by a desire and commitment to serve others.
