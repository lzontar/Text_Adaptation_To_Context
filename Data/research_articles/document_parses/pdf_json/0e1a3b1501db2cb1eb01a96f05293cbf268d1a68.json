The physical distancing measures mandated globally to contain the spread of COVID-19 are radically reducing adolescents' opportunities to engage in face-to-face social contact outside their household. In this interdisciplinary Viewpoint, we describe literature from a variety of domains that highlight how social deprivation in adolescence might have far-reaching consequences. Human studies have shown the importance of peer acceptance and peer influence in adolescence. Animal research has shown that social deprivation and isolation have unique effects on brain and behaviour in adolescence compared with other stages of life. However, the decrease in adolescent face-to-face contact might be less detrimental due to widespread access to digital forms of social interaction through technologies such as social media. The findings reviewed highlight how physical distancing might have a disproportionate effect on an age group for whom peer interaction is a vital aspect of development.",

Such measures are likely to have a substantial effect, not only on the economy and society, but also on individuals' mental health and wellbeing through factors such as reduced contact with other people. It is possible that the effects of such deprivation of social contact will extend beyond the period of physical distancing and might affect the population for years to come.",

This global crisis has, however, struck at a time when many adolescents are well positioned to mitigate some of these social shortfalls using digital means of connection. 5 This Viewpoint therefore synthesises interdisciplinary scientific findings relating to adolescent social processing, social isolation, and digital social behaviours. We also highlight how adolescents might be particularly affected by social deprivation, especially the reduction of peer contact, and how this must be taken into account when considering the long-term consequences of global COVID-19 prev ention measures.",

For example, adolescents who are living with high functioning families and who have positive relationships with parents or caregivers and siblings might be less affected by physical distancing than adolescents who do not have positive family relationships or who are living alone. Furthermore, as physical distancing rules vary by country, region, and across time, some face-to-face contact with non-household members might be permitted for certain adolescents. Nevertheless, many young people around the world currently have sub stantially fewer opportunities to interact face-to-face with peers in their social network, putting their social needs at risk of not being met at a crucial time of social development.",

Several studies have focused on loneliness in humans and have reported a connection between self-reported loneliness and mental health problems. 30 However, such studies do not clearly establish whether loneliness results in mental illness or vice versa. Furthermore, human loneliness is not straightforward to study experimentally as loneliness is not a simple product of objective social deprivation: people can be alone without feeling lonely or feel lonely even in a crowd. 30 In contrast, there is a long history of animal research documenting the causal effects of social deprivation, including complete isolation, on brain and behavioural development during animal adolescence. 31 These animal models usually involve depriving animals of any form of social contact with their own species and studying changes in brain and behaviour both during and after social isolation. Although these experimental studies involve more extreme forms of social deprivation than the physical distancing experienced during COVID-19, the animal research literature provides valuable insights into the effects of depriving the developing animal of social contact during a sensitive period for social interaction.",

First, social isolation is a stressor, and some of the effects of isolation can be attributed to general stress effects (engagement of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis). 35, 36 Second, social isolation also has effects that go beyond such general stress effects and can be attributed to the deprivation of stimuli crucial for the maintenance of neurobiological mechan isms and development. 33 An advantage of rodent animal models such as mice and rats is that their development progresses through similar stages as human development. 37 To investigate the effects of social deprivation or isolation on adolescent develop-Viewpoint ment, rodent studies have focused on the time period between weaning and adult maturity (corresponding to the time period from around postnatal days 21-60). 33, 34, 36, 37 Similar to adolescent humans, after weaning, rodents show a strong orientation towards their peers. 38 These animals actively seek out peer interaction and these interactions are considered to be important social input for healthy development 39 and specifically for social learning. 34",

            "text": "Many animal studies using rodents have investigated the effects of complete social isolation at different stages of development. Although the negative effects of social isolation in very early development are mainly linked to a lack of maternal care, 33, 36 it is specifically interaction with peers that is important for adolescent animals. 39 On a behavioural level, even a brief duration (eg, 24 h) of isolation in adolescent rodents can cause increased anxiety, 40 hyperactivity, 41 and heightened sensitivity to social rewards, 42 which extends to the seeking of food or drug rewards, making these animals particularly prone to developing addictions. 43 Although reintro ducing acutely isolated animals to social contact can alleviate some of the negative effects of short-term isolation, such as anxiety, 40 there are long-lasting negative consequences that are not easily remedied. For example, increased ethanol consumption in animals after social isolation persists even after the reintroduction to social housing. 44 When rodent adolescent isolation occurs chronically, over 1 week or longer, it has even more profound effects. Chronically isolated adolescent rodents (isolated throughout the whole adolescent period) have shown abnormal behaviours such as hyper-reactivity to stressful situations 45 and increased aggres sion. 46 Isolation-induced changes additionally occur for cognitive processes, such as learning and attention, and result in diminished performance on tasks that involve these processes. Particularly, isolation during adolescence results in cognitive flexibility deficits that impair reward learning, 47 reversal learning, 48 and attention shifting. 49 Other studies have deprived animals of social contact with peers during their peak social play periods, 50 rather than complete isolation throughout adolescence. In most of these studies, animals were isolated from peers from around postnatal days 21 to 43, corresponding roughly to early adolescence (aged 10-13 years) and mid adolescence (aged 14-16 years) in humans. 34 Such studies show similar effects to those investigating isolation throughout the whole adolescent period, including increased anxiety-like behaviours, depression-like behaviours, and reward seeking, but impaired reward learning and habituation to novel stimuli. 36 Furthermore, increased aggression is also observed when rodents are raised with genetically modified conspecifics that show reduced social interaction, 51 suggesting that behavioural changes also occur under less extreme forms of social deprivation.",

            "text": "Complete social isolation in adolescent rodents evokes widespread structural and functional changes in the brain, most prominently in neuromodulatory dopamine and serotonin systems and particularly within cortical and striatal targets. 33, 36, 37 Thus, complete social deprivation during rodent adolescence affects brain development, mainly affecting motivation and reward processes. 33, 36 Importantly, these effects are specific to isolation during rodent adolescence and do not occur to a similar extent when isolation occurs before or after adolescence. 33, 36 More specifically, although some divergent effects have been observed, the most consistent findings report that dopamine release in reward regions such as the nucleus accumbens increases following adolescent isolation, but dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex decreases. 33, 36, 37 These changes result in dysregulation of dopaminergic signalling in distinct brain structures responsible for processing salient stimuli. 52 Additional neurochemical changes include alterations to serotonin levels, with the direction of the effects differing between brain regions. For example, the prefrontal cortex shows increased serotonergic activity, whereas other brain areas, such as the hippocampus, show decreased activity. These alterations have been proposed to underlie observed behavioural changes such as increased anxiety and hyperactivity. 33, 34 Even if not completely isolated, but instead deprived of peer contact by being reared solely with an adult animal, adolescent rodents show brainlevel changes including reduced synaptic pruning in the pre frontal cortex. 53 There are several studies that have investigated the effects of social deprivation at different stages of development in other species, such as non-human primates, birds, fish, sheep, and others. Many studies have investigated deprivation of peer contact in adult animals 54 and have found that, across species, deprivation of contact with peers resulted in negative behavioural and physiological effects, suggesting that the need for peer to peer contact is universal across social species. 55 Although much scarcer, research on the effects of social deprivation in adolescent non-human primates has shown effects in line with the rodent research: deprivation of contact with peers for 1-3 weeks results in anxiety-like behaviours and a reduction in cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus (a brain region involved in learning and memory). 56",

Most animal studies focus predominately on males, with female rodents included in only a few studies, and therefore do not represent the constellation of the human population.

They suggest that such isolation in prison leads to increased distress, depression, and aggression as well as increased prevalence of self harm in adults. 57 These detrimental effects are amplified in adolescent prisoners: one study showed that being younger than 19 years of age and assignment to solitary confinement were the two strongest predictors of self harm in prisoners. 58 However, the nature of these studies means that they relate to non-representative groups and are therefore difficult to interpret due to many confounding factors.",

There is, therefore, evidence that at least some of the effects of social isolation observed in animal models can be extended to humans.

Specifically, it appears that it is particularly the lack of social interaction with peers that elicits behavioural and brain-level changes. The physical distancing measures that are currently in place across the globe in response to COVID-19 will probably reduce many adolescents' ability to fulfil their social needs. Although adolescents might still have contact with household members and with people beyond their home via virtual forms of communication, opportunities for face-to-face interaction with peers will be drastically reduced or eliminated. Although for some adolescents, social interactions at home might meet their social needs, physical distancing will challenge many teenagers' capacity to connect with peers. Research is therefore needed to understand whether the effects of social deprivation found in animal studies can be extended to apply to human adolescents. However, such research will need to investigate the possibility that virtual social connection might mitigate these effects.",

There is a 15% gap in smartphone ownership between lower-income and higher-income teenagers in the USA. 60 Moreover, 58% of Nigerians with secondary education or more have a social media account compared with 10% of Nigerians without secondary education. 5 Although physical distancing measures would have stopped all adolescent peer contact except the landline phone and letter writing just 3 decades ago, active social contact can now be mediated by digital applications, whether that be social media, video chatting or conferencing, blogging, or online gaming. 61 Digitallymediated interactions challenge our traditional conceptualisations of what socialising entails 63 as they can be asynchronous, click based, or audio-video reliant.

Due to the physical constraints of the MRI scanner, all neuroimaging studies focusing on the social brain and social cognition are limited to digitally-mediated social inter actions instead of their face-to-face counterpart. Functional MRI studies have shown that experiencing partial components of Viewpoint positive social interactions such as real time sharing of eye gaze, 67 hearing someone laugh after a telling a joke, 68 and observing videos from someone who has a shared intention, 69 activates neural reward systems in similar ways as do non-social rewards (eg, monetary rewards).

These can encourage a wide variety of activities ranging from popular pastimes such as connecting with friends or engaging with social media influencers 71 to less common activities such as accessing digital mental health interventions or exposure to harmful content (eg, online gambling and grooming). 72 Social media has especially become popular in the adolescent age group over the past decade. 61 To gauge the effect of social media on personal relationships and wellbeing, it is necessary to differentiate between its different uses. 73 Specifically, active uses of social media, for example engaging in directed communication (ie, messaging) or posting directly on another person's social media profile, have been shown to increase wellbeing 74 and help maintain personal relationships. 75 However, social media also allows for other activities less akin to the digital communication previously described (eg, passive uses such as scrolling through social media newsfeeds). These behaviours have routinely not been linked to positive outcomes. 76 There is initial experimental evidence that such passive uses could even negatively influence wellbeing, possibly by increasing social comparison and envy. 77 To understand how digital technologies affect adolescents who are physical distancing, we need to differentiate between connection promoting (ie, active and communicative) and non-connection promoting (ie, passive) uses of social media, 73 instead of focusing solely on the time spent using this medium. 78 Furthermore, there is growing consensus that the consequences of social media use will be dependent on individual differences. 78 Some studies have supported the rich-get-richer view of online communication (ie, those who already have strong offline friendships might benefit most from digital interaction), whereas those with a liability to mental health issues might be more susceptible to the negative effects 78 (eg, those who have been victimised in person are more likely to be victimised or bullied online). 79 It is difficult to parse the unique effects of social media and digital technology from the noisy background of adolescent life, making it challenging to give accurate and evidence-based recommendations in times of physical distancing that go further than promoting common sense approaches. 80 However, the existing evidence shows that certain aspects of digital communication can engender social connection and might, therefore, mitigate the consequences of physical distancing. Research should focus on this possibility.",

Adolescents are at a unique period in their lives when the social environment is important for crucial functions in brain development, self-concept construct ion, and mental health. Rodent studies show substantial and potentially long-term effects of social deprivation and isolation in adolescence on neuro chemistry, structural brain development, and behaviours associated with mental health problems. Research on social isolation has almost entirely been carried out in animal models and little is known about how social deprivation affects human development. This Viewpoint considers the potential of social media and other digital tech nologies to mitigate the severity of social deprivation effects on human adolescents, but more research focused on this precise question is needed.",

Furthermore, there is little understanding on how the consequences of physical distancing compare with other stressors experienced by adolescents during the COVID-19 crisis, including economic pressures, uncertainty, and loss of public events marking key life stages and rites of passage. Adolescent physical distancing should therefore be given urgent consideration by policymakers and the opening of schools and other social environments should be a priority once physical distancing measures can be eased.
