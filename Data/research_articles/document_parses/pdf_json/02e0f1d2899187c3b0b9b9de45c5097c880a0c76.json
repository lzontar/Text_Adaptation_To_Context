We here developed a new tool for analyzing virus-transcribed mRNAs, not virus copy numbers, in the data of conventional and single-cell RNA-sequencing of human cells. Our pipeline, named VIRTUS (VIRal Transcript Usage Sensor), was able to detect 763 viruses including herpesviruses, retroviruses, and even SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and quantify their transcripts in the sequence data. This tool thus enabled simultaneously detecting infected cells, the composition of multiple viruses within the cell, and the endogenous host gene expression profile of the cell. This bioinformatics method would be instrumental in addressing the possible effects of covertly infecting viruses on certain diseases and developing new treatments to target such viruses.

For example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been reported to play a causative role for head-neck cancer and lymphoma (Zapatka et al., 2020) , and possibly for multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (Harley et al., 2018) . It remains to be determined, however, which viruses are present in normal tissues and whether their state of activation contributes to disease development. Viruses can be detected by several methods such as antibody-based assays and PCR. Virus copy numbers in the genome can also be assessed by analyzing NGS derived data such as VirTect (Khan et al., 2019) and Kraken2 (Wood et al., 2019) . On the other hand, it has been technologically difficult to examine the state of the virus in host tissues especially in relation to endogenous expression of host genes. In addition, since viral infection is heterogeneous depending on cell populations, it is unclear which cells are infected, how many virus species are present in the cells, and what states the viruses and the host cells assume. To address these issues, RNA information derived from polyA-based reverse transcription should be useful for analyzing intracellular viruses, since viruses intercept the host transcription systems, which yield polyA-tailed viral RNA transcripts along with endogenous RNAs from the host cells. We here attempted to establish a tool for measuring multiple viral transcriptomes even in a single cell.",

Then, we measured HSV-1 transcripts by Alevin (Srivastava et al., 2019) , which was suitable for downstream analysis of VIRTUS. We detected infected single cells, and found differentially expressed genes, such as RASD1 and MT-RNR1, between infected and non-infected cells, using VIRTUS and a standard single-cell pipeline.
