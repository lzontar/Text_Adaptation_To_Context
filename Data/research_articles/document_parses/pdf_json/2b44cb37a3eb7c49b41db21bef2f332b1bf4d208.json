Digital telereview appointments through this platform were patient-led and were not actively rescheduled by emergency department staff if missed or cancelled. Before the digital telereview appointment (synchronous teleconsultation with video, voice, and text messaging), patients received an in-app form that allowed them to report important history or symptoms beforehand (asynchronous). This was sent to the emergency department staff on-duty before video consultation, providing them with the opportunity to clarify any uncertainties with the on-duty attending physician before synchronous consultation.
