Further genetic and structural insights are needed to unambiguously establish PI4(K) as the target. However, we note that the Plasmodium PI(4)K inhibitors diaryl-aminopyridine (MMV390048) 17 and quinoxaline (BQR695) 12 , which are inactive against C. parvum and C. hominis, do not inhibit CpPI(4)K enzymatic activity (Fig. 1f) . Finally, mechanistic studies revealed an increased K m for ATP in the presence of KDU731 (Fig. 1h) , suggesting ATP-competitive inhibition similar to that previously observed for the Plasmodium enzyme 12 . Additional structure-activity relationship analysis of pyrazolopyridines against Cryptosporidium is found in the Supplementary Information. Taken together, our data suggest that pyrazolopyridines are inhibitors of CpPI(4)K that bind to the ATP-binding site of the enzyme with a favourable selectivity window over human PI(4)K.",

A very safe drug profile is thus a key component of the target product profile 18, 19 . KDU731 has a selectivity index of more than 100 (half-maximal cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) of HepG2 = 15.6 \u03bc M and half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) of C. parvum CPE = 0.1 \u03bc M) (Extended Data Table 1 ). In a battery of safety pharmacology assays, the compound does not show intrinsic risks for cardiotoxicity, mutagenicity, clastogenicity, or phototoxicity, and it does not bind significantly to a panel of human anti-targets (Extended Data Tables 1 and 2) . KDU731 safety was further evaluated in a 2-week toxicology study in rats using a solid dispersion formulation to maximize systemic exposure (~ 25-fold). In this study, no significant histopathological changes and only minor changes in clinical chemistry and haematology were observed (slight elevation of cholesterol and phosphate Article reSeArcH ions and increase in red blood cells, see Supplementary Information). Importantly, no haematopoietic toxicity related to potential inhibition of PI3K or PI4K lipid kinases was observed, suggesting that the in vitro selectivity of KDU731 translated to lack of host toxicity in vivo (Extended Data Table 1 ). Children with cryptosporidiosis in resource-limited settings frequently suffer comorbidities including HIV, tuberculosis, and other infections; anti-cryptosporidial drugs will thus probably be used along with other medications, and the risk of drug-drug interactions needs to be minimized. Consistent with the requirement, KDU731 did not inhibit any of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and did not induce human pregnane X receptor (Extended Data Table 1). KDU731 pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and distribution were examined in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. Upon intravenous administration, KDU731 displayed a low-to-moderate volume of distribution (V ss = 1.12 and 2.15 l kg \u22121 ), a low total systemic clearance (CL = 6.8 and 16 ml min \u22121 kg \u22121 ), and a half-life ranging from 1 to 4 h (Extended Data Table 3 ). KDU731 orally administered in suspension formulation displayed a moderate half-life (t 1/2 = 2-4 h) in all three species. KDU731 was selected as a drug candidate because it shows moderate-to-low oral bioavailability (37% in rodents, 9% in nonhuman primates). As Cryptosporidium primarily infects the intestinal epithelium, we reasoned that systemic exposure may not be required for efficacy and that limiting systemic exposure may further enhance the safety margin of a cryptosporidiosis drug.",

We used genetically modified parasites to build more facile models. We established the EC 50 of KDU731 for transgenic parasites 8 in HCT-8 using Nanoluciferase (Nluc) as a readout and found it comparable to the EC 50 for wild-type parasites (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Next, we inoculated 6-to 8-weekold C57BL/6 interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3 )-knockout mice with 10,000 oocysts and monitored infection by following parasite-derived luciferase activity in the faeces (Fig. 2a) . Infected mice were treated orally with KDU731 in suspension formulation and parasite load was measured in the pooled faeces by Nluc and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay with a high degree of correlation (Spearman coefficient = 0.786; two-tailed P = 0.048). The Nluc assay has a small sample requirement (20 mg) and thus could be conducted on individual mice as well as pooled faeces (unpaired t-test comparing means of individual and pooled readings showed no significant difference, two-tailed P = 0.3862). Importantly, KDU731 greatly reduced oocyst shedding regardless of assay method ( Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4b , c; non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, pooled Nluc two-tailed P < 0.001; faecal qPCR two-tailed P = 0.0042). In a modified design, KDU731 (10 mg per kg (body weight)) treatment was initiated at the peak of infection, again resulting in a significant reduction in oocyst shedding (Fig. 2a, c) . At the end of the treatment period, three mice per group were killed and intestines were processed for histology. We did not observe parasites in the intestines of treated animals, whereas those that received vehicle showed substantial infection (Fig. 2d) .",

Intestinal tissue load was quantified by PCR and we found strong correlation with tissue luminescence (r 2 = 0.8; Extended Data Fig. 5a , b). KDU731 treatment of mice infected with Fluc parasites was initiated on day 7, when all mice registered high levels of abdominal luciferase activity and mice were imaged daily. Tissue load dropped markedly within 2 days of treatment, and fell below the limit of detection after 5 days (Fig. 2e, g) . Changes in luminescence imaging were mirrored by faecal oocyst shedding quantified by PCR (Spearman coefficient = 0.840, two-tailed P = 0.0006; Extended Data Fig. 5c ). For comparison, we evaluated nitazoxanide at 100 mg per kg (body weight) and observed no change ( Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 6 ), consistent with previous reports on immunosuppressed hosts 5,21 .",

Unlike nitazoxanide, KDU731 demonstrated in vivo efficacy in immunocompromised mice. Additionally, treatment in neonatal calves, which closely matches the pathophysiological and pharmacological challenges faced in the treatment of young malnourished children, led to a significant decrease in parasite shedding and rapid resolution of diarrhoea and dehydration. Our lead candidate, KDU731, displays good anti-cryptosporidial activity and meets a broad range of safety and pharmacology criteria required for a much-needed novel cryptosporidiosis therapeutic intervention. Further safety and pharmacological preclinical evaluation is currently ongoing to support the initiation of human clinical trials. Article reSeArcH",

High-content imaging HCT-8 cell infection assays with C. parvum and C. hominis were conducted following established protocols 27 in 384-well flat, black clear-bottom plates using an Opera QEHS (PerkinElmer) imaging system. We also developed a cytopathic effect (CPE)based assay monitoring host cell viability using CTG reagent (Promega) that did not require staining or imaging. Further details on EC 50 determination for C. parvum and C. hominis using both assays in a ten-point dose-response with threefold compound dilution will be described elsewhere (A.T.C. et al., manuscript in preparation). The EC 50 of KDU731 was also determined using Nluc-expressing parasites 8 .

All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the respective institutional animal care and use committees. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was determined on the basis of the minimum number of animals required for good data distribution and statistics. Blinding was not possible in these experiments but animals were selected randomly for each group. KDU731 was formulated in suspension formulation for per os dosing and solution formulation for intravenous dosing as described in Extended Data Table 3 . For rat toxicology studies, KDU731 was formulated in solid dispersion. KDU731 (20%) and the required excipients (37.5% Soluplus, 37.5% Eudragit E PO, and 5% SLS) were dissolved in ethanol/dichloromethane (v/v = 1:1) at a total solid concentration of 10 g l \u22121 by sonication and heating to 50 \u00b0C. The solution was spray dried using a Buchi B290 Mini spray dryer with an inlet temperature of 75 \u00b0C, aspirator set to 100%, and pump to 35%, followed by overnight drying under vacuum at 40 \u00b0C. The amorphous nature was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis and powder was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Solid dispersion powder suspension was prepared freshly in 0.5% HPMC in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.7) at 10 mg ml \u22121 of KDU731 (equivalent to solid dispersion powder 50 mg ml \u22121 ) and rats were dosed within 1 h of preparation. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic studies were collected between 0 and 24 h post-dose. Compound plasma concentrations were determined by LC/MS. Plasma samples from pharmacokinetic studies were extracted with acetonitrile:methanol:acetic acid (90:9.8:0.2) containing warfarin as an internal standard, using an 8.8:1 extractant to plasma ratio. Analyte quantitation was performed by LC/MS/MS. Liquid chromatography was performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system, with an Agilent Zorbax Phenyl (3.5 \u03bc m, 4.6 mm \u00d7 75 mm) column at an oven temperature of 45 \u00b0C, coupled with a API4000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using Watson LIMS software, by non-compartmental analysis. Rat toxicology study. KDU731 solid dispersion powder suspension was prepared freshly in 0.5% HPMC in 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.7) at 10 mg ml \u22121 and was orally administered to five male Wistar rats at a daily oral dose of 30 or 100 mg per kg (body weight) per day for 2 weeks. Five control animals were treated with vehicle only. Rats were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Animal and subjected to Article reSeArcH 3 days of quarantine and acclimatization before study begin. All animals were subjected to daily clinical observation, and body weight and food consumption were determined for all animals enrolled in the study. Clinical laboratory evaluations (haematology and clinical chemistry) were performed at the scheduled necropsy on day 15. Organs were examined for gross pathology and weighed before fixation and preparation for histology. Samples from organs and tissues prepared from animals assigned to control and high-dose groups were examined microscopically. Specifically, the heart, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, colon, rectum), kidney, liver, spleen, lung, testes, epididymis, adrenals, and thymus were examined for histopathological changes.",

The 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and 3\u2032 UTR of the C. parvum actin gene were amplified from parasite genomic DNA and ligated into the KpnI/ClaI and SpeI/BamHI sites of plasmid TK-Eno-Nluc-Neo-TK 8 , respectively. The coding sequence for red-shifted luciferase 20 was amplified from pTubRE9 vector (a gift from M. Meissner, University of Glasgow, UK) and cloned into SalI/NheI restriction sites replacing Nluc. A 404-base-pair fragment of the 5\u2032 TK flank, the tk gene, and a ribosomal 3\u2032 UTR were inserted upstream of the 5\u2032 actin UTR using Gibson Assembly cloning (New England Biolabs). The final vector, along with the Cas9 plasmid containing a TK guide RNA (GAAGAATACAATTTCTAAGG) targeting the 3\u2032 end of the tk gene, was used to transfect C. parvum sporozoites. Sporozoites were delivered by surgery into the small intestine of C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J, Jackson Laboratory) using procedures described previously 8 . Note that UGA1 Nluc parasites were generated using C. parvum IOWA II oocysts purchased from Sterling Parasitology Laboratory, University of Arizona, whereas the UGA2 Fluc strain was engineered using C. parvum IOWA II oocysts purchased from Bunch Grass Farms, Deary, Idaho, USA. Mouse model following faecal oocyst load. All mouse studies described in this section were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Georgia (animal use protocol number A2016 01-028-Y1-A4). C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice aged 6-8 weeks were selected randomly for each group (n = 5) and infected with 10,000 C. parvum UGA1 Nluc 8 oocysts. No statistical tests were used to predetermine sample size. KDU731 was formulated in 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose and 0.5% (w/v) polysorbate in water and administered to mice daily for 7 days by oral gavage beginning on day 3 or day 11 after infection. Control mice were given only vehicle. Mice were monitored for weight loss, fur ruffling, hunched posture, and inactivity. Mice showing a weight loss of equal to or greater than 15% were euthanized. Faecal samples were collected (not blinded) and luminescence measurements were performed as described 8 (parasite Nluc activity is stable in faeces when refrigerated). Measurements were performed on faeces collected from individual mice as well as from cage-wide (pooled) collections. For Nluc assay, 20 mg of faeces was mashed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), ten 3-mm glass beads were added to the tube, followed by vigorous agitation using a vortex mixer for 1 min and a short spin to pellet faecal material. Three aliquots of 100 \u03bc l lysate were dispensed into 96-well white plates and an equal amount of Nano-Glo reconstituted buffer containing 1:50 of Nano-Glo substrate (Promega) was added, luminescence was read using a Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments).",

Samples were subjected to five rounds of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in 100 \u00b0C heater block before DNA isolation using a ZR Faecal DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, California, USA). qPCR was performed using sample DNA along with standards prepared from uninfected faeces spiked with oocysts. PCR primers JVAF and JAVR and probe 5\u2032 FAM-labelled JVAR 33 were used along with the following cycling parameters: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, and annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s. Each 20 \u03bc l PCR reaction contained 10 \u03bc l of SSoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA), 0.4375 \u03bc M of each primer, 0.125 \u03bc M probe, and 2 \u03bc l DNA. Mouse model following tissue parasite load using whole-animal imaging. IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (n = 5 per group) were infected with 10,000 C. parvum UGA2 Fluc oocysts expressing red-shifted Fluc and given a daily dose of 10 mg per kg (body weight) KDU731, nitazoxanide (Sigma) at 100 mg per kg (body weight), or control formulation for one week by oral gavage starting on day 7 after infection. Parasite tissue load was measured by in vivo imaging. At the beginning of the experiment, the abdominal area of mice was shaved with clippers to increase the signal during imaging on an IVIS Lumina II system (Caliper Life Sciences). Mice were injected subcutaneously with 125 mg per kg (body weight) d-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St Louis, Missouri, USA). Five minutes after luciferin injection, mice were anaesthetized in an induction chamber using 3% isofluorane and then placed in the camera chamber. Mice were kept under anaesthesia by administering isofluorane through individual nose cones. Images were acquired using a setting of F-stop = 1/16, binning = medium, and an exposure time of 5 min. Regions of interest were selected for each mouse and total flux (photons per second) was quantified using IVIS Lumina II Living Image 4.0 Software (Caliper Life Sciences). To validate measurements of parasite tissue burden, mice infected for 1 week were imaged, killed, and the small intestine was removed and cut into 12 (1-cm) segments, and flushed with PBS. Sections were imaged three times in PBS with d-luciferin, after which genomic DNA was isolated from each segment using a ZR Faecal DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, California, USA). qPCR was performed using the parameters described above and parasite burden was established against a standard curve of samples with known parasite DNA content. Histology of intestinal tissue. Mice treated with KDU731 or control formulation were killed and intestinal tissue was collected within 15 min of death. Sections of the small intestine were taken from the 1-2 cm region anterior to the caecum, flushed with PBS, and fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin. Fixed samples were embedded in paraffin and 4 \u03bc m sections were cut (RM225 Microtome, Leica, Buffalo Grove, Illinois, USA). Sections were de-paraffinized and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Neonatal calf efficacy study. All calves used in this study were cared for in compliance with the Washington State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sample size was calculated assuming that 85% of treated calves had resolution of clinical illness by the end of the treatment period (48 h after administration of treatment number 14) compared with 15% of control calves. Assuming a type I error risk of 5% and a type II error risk of 80%, seven calves were needed in the treatment group, plus two positive controls. In the event of calf death or removal from the study, an additional four calves were added to the control group (n = 6). Sample size was calculated using Epi Info. Fifteen Friesian-Holstein bull calves were enrolled in November 2015 and February 2016. At birth, all calves enrolled in November were randomized to treatment with KDU731 (n = 7), positive infection control (n = 2), and negative infection control (n = 1). The five calves enrolled in February were positive controls. The perineum of the dam was cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub, and calves were delivered onto single-use plastic sheets to prevent exposure to environmental pathogens. Calves with abnormal physical examination findings and those weighing less than 29.5 kg at birth were excluded. Enrolled calves received 4 l \u2265 50 g IgG/l commercial colostrum replacer (Land O'Lakes) and a 3 ml subcutaneous injection of vitamin E and selenium (Merck Animal Health). Calves were then transported from the commercial dairy farm to Washington State University where they were housed in individual box stalls in a BSL-2 facility. Shatter-proof mirrors were provided for enrichment. Within 48 h of birth, blood samples were collected and evaluated for adequate passive transfer of colostral immunity. Calves were offered a commercial 20% protein/20% fat non-medicated milk replacer (Land O'Lakes) every 12 h via nipple bucket. At each feeding, calves were fed an average of 8.8 g of dry matter per kilogram of birth weight for the duration of the study. Water was provided ad libitum. All calves randomized to treatment or positive control groups were experimentally challenged within the first 48 h of life with 5 \u00d7 10 7 C. parvum oocysts (Iowa II, Bunch Grass Farm, ID) through the rigid portion of an oroesophageal feeding tube. Oocysts were within 1 month of isolation and were cleaned in 0.6% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min and then washed four times with PBS. The negative control calf was sham-challenged to maintain blinding of study personnel.",

Calves were submitted for necropsy to the Washington State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Samples of the liver, spleen, kidney, and small intestine were collected for histological analysis. The remaining calves continued in the study until the cessation of faecal oocyst shedding as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Merifluor, Meridian Diagnostics). Upon cessation of faecal oocyst shedding (two consecutive negative faecal samples over 48 h), calves were euthanized and submitted to the Washington State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for necropsy.Oocysts counts were interpolated by qPCR at the Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center using serial dilutions of commercially purified C. parvum oocysts (Waterborne, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA). Total nucleic acid was extracted from supernatants of 200 mg of faecal sample, oocyst suspension, or negative control homogenized in 400 \u03bc l of PBS using a magnetic-bead-based automated procedure (AM1840, Applied Biosytems, Foster City, California, USA). An exogenous control (MS2 phage) was added to the lysis buffer to control for PCR inhibition 34 . qPCR for Cryptosporidium spp. 18S rRNA was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500-FAST platform using commercial master mix (ToughMix, Quantabio) and oligonucleotides previously described 35 . This count was standardized by the faecal dry weight percentage. A 5-10 g portion of each original faecal sample was dried at 108 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h (Squaroid Vaccuum Oven, Labline, India) and weighed 24 .Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential methods. A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine whether data were non-Gaussian. Depending on the distribution of data, continuous variables were evaluated using a Student's t-test, analysis of variance, or a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Analysis of variance was used to assess differences in faecal oocyst counts and faecal consistency score between the KDU731-treated and untreated calves. The effect of comorbidity on outcomes of interest was evaluated using a Student's t-test. Data were analysed using JMP Pro 11.0 (SAS Institute).",

Mice were killed and the small intestine was resected and imaged (representative image shown). Infection of the intestine ranged in intensity from heavy in the ileum to more moderate in the jejunum and caecum (see radiance scale bar for comparison). Intestines were cut into 12 segments and the luminescence of each segment was recorded. b, qPCR analysis of intestinal segments was performed in triplicate and plotted against the respective luminescence measurements. Regression analysis found robust correlation of tissue luminescence and PCR for parasite DNA, with r 2 = 0.8. c, Mice were infected with 10,000 UGA2 FLuc oocysts, and 7 days after infection animals were treated daily for a week with vehicle or 10 mg per kg (body weight) KDU731. Whole-animal imaging during the treatment period is shown in Fig. 2g . Faecal oocyst load was determined by measuring parasite DNA by qPCR in faeces pooled from a cage of five mice.

Severity of diarrhoea and dehydration in individual calves challenged with 5 \u00d7 10 7 C. parvum oocysts. Infected calves were treated with vehicle (n = 6) or with KDU731 (n = 7); n represents the number of calves. Every 12 h, calves were stimulated to defecate, faecal consistency was evaluated, and hydration status was assessed. Faecal consistency and hydration scores were assigned according to the study rubric (see Supplementary  Information ).
