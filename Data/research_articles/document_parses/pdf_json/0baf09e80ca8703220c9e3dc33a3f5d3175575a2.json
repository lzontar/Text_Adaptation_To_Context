Sequencing of respiratory tract samples revealed a novel coronavirus, initially termed as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The disease was subsequently named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2] . To date, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected 25 countries and remains a global health concern with an estimated case-fatality rate of 2% [3] . Singapore reported its first imported case of COVID-19 on 23 January 2020. Prior to 3 February 2020, there was no evidence of local humanto-human transmission. On 3 February, a local cluster suggestive of limited community transmission was reported [4] . Our patient was the first pediatric case detected in Singapore with confirmed COVID-19 and he remained largely asymptomatic. Our infant was part of a household transmission cluster where both parents and their live-in helper were infected with COVID-19. This was the result of an occupational exposure to a large tourist group from China. A case series of 9 infants with confirmed COVID-19 showed that the majority of the infants were symptomatic and had strong epidemiological risk factors [5] . Understanding the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 across all population groups, especially infants and young children, is critical for public health containment measures to be effective.",

            "text": "Following the outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan and export of cases to countries worldwide, there was an urgent need to contain the spread of the novel virus. Quick and accurate identification of cases for isolation or quarantine remains a key pillar of public health efforts to contain an emerging epidemic. This strategy is dependent on accurate case definitions to identify patients for further management, including testing if available. Most of the current case definitions used globally are developed based on clinical signs and symptoms collated from COVID-19 in adults, which include either acute respiratory symptoms or more severe signs of lower respiratory tract infection [9] . While most adults with COVID-19 infection have fever, respiratory symptoms, and/ or chest radiograph changes, current data suggest that the majority of the infected children have mild or no symptoms [10] [11] [12] . Our case highlights a likelihood of poor performance of current case definitions used to contain COVID-19, especially in infants. There is an urgent need to better understand the full clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in the pediatric population in order to refine public health containment strategies. ",
