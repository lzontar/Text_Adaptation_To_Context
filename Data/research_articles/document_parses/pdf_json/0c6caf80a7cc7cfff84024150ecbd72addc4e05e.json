The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prior receipt of antibiotics on the microorganism distribution. Methods: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a 3200-bed tertiary, referral, teaching hospital in eastern China. During a 2-year period, all hospitalized patients treated with antimicrobial agents were enrolled in this study. Among 48,692 patients evaluated, the 27,792 (57.1%) who were sampled within 2 days before or after administration of the first dose of antimicrobial agents were included. Distribution of clinical specimens and the microorganism were compared between before and after antibiotic drug treatment groups. Results: Compared to specimens taken after antibiotics exposure, specimens taken before antibiotics exposure had a higher proportion of blood and urine specimens and a higher culture positive rate (all P < 0.001). Higher percentages of Staphylococcus aureus (9.9% vs. 8.5%, P = 0.041), non-fermenting bacteria (27.7% vs. 19.9%, P < 0.001), and fungi (8.4% vs. 4.0%, P < 0.001) were isolated from the group after antibiotics exposure, while the percentages of Streptococcus spp. (4.8% vs. 2.7%, P < 0.001), Haemophilus influenzae (2.3% vs. 0.8%, P < 0.001), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.7% vs. 0.1%, P < 0.001) were higher in the group before antibiotics exposure. Further analysis found significant differences of microbes derived from respiratory secretions, blood or urine samples. We found, after antibiotics exposure, the separation rate of non-fermenting bacteria was significantly increased (all P < 0.05), and the separation rate of Candida spp. was higher, with statistical significance in airway secretion and urine samples (both P < 0.05), but the separation rate of Staphylococcus aureus among the three groups was not affected by antibiotics. In addition, the isolation rate of Streptococcus spp. in blood and urine samples decreased significantly (both P < 0.05) after antibiotics exposure. Interestingly, no statistical difference was found for microbes isolated from body fluid specimens between the two groups. Conclusions: The outcome revealed that antibiotic-insensitive organisms such as non-fermentative bacteria and fungi were more frequently isolated after antibiotics exposure. However, this trend might be specimen dependent and was not obvious in body fluid specimens.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance has increased in recent decades. Antimicrobial stewardship is important for addressing the problem of resistant pathogens, and obtaining specimens prior to the administration of antimicrobials is a key part of this program. Sterilization of cultures may occur shortly after the use of antibiotics [1, 2] , which may lead to negative culture results as described in some research [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, studies conducted by Montravers et al. [10] and Harbarth et al. [11] showed that starting antibiotic therapy before sample collection may result in detecting less-sensitive microorganisms. However, the former only included 76 consecutive patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia [10] , and the latter [11] mainly evaluated gram-negative pathogens. In addition, one study assessed the impact of prebiopsy antibiotics on pathogen recovery in hematogenous vertebral osteomyelitis patients and revealed that antibiotic exposure before biopsy did not negatively impact pathogen recovery [12] . Therefore, a systematic study of the microbiological differences isolated from samples taken before and after the initiation of antibiotic therapy, which to the best of our knowledge is lacking in the literature, is necessary.",

The results revealed that the percentage of S. aureus was higher in the SAA group, while the isolation rates of CNS and Streptococcus spp. were higher in the SBA group. The differences in S. aureus and Streptococcus spp. could be explained by the fact that Streptococcus spp. antimicrobial susceptibility is significantly higher than that of S. aureus, so the separation rate after treatment may be significantly reduced. However, the reason for the decrease in the separation rate of CNS after the use of antibiotics is unclear. As for gram-negative bacteria, the proportion of non-fermenting bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and S. maltophilia isolated from the SAA group was higher than that of the SBA group. It is well known that non-fermenting Fig. 4 Comparison of microorganisms isolated from urine between SBA (top 7) and SAA groups. Abbreviations: SBA, specimen taken before antibiotic therapy; SAA, specimen taken after antibiotic therapy; CNS, Coagulase-negative staphylococci; S. aureus, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria are opportunistic nosocomial pathogens and are often found in the hospital environment, frequently with multiple-resistance mechanisms. For example, Acinetobacter baumannii has accumulated resistance to most antibiotics [13] [14] [15] , and in most cases antibiotic treatment should be avoided by virtue of low potential virulence [16] . Additionally, this study also found that the separation rates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were significantly lower after antibiotics administration. It has been speculated that the two bacteria are pathogens of typical community sources, and that they are generally sensitive to most antibacterial agents as is consistent with the present results [17] , although recent studies have shown that resistance in these two bacteria is increasing [18] . In fact, the differences of microorganism distribution between the groups could partially be explained by the antibiotics prescribed before sampling in SAA group. It was found that cephalosporins, \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor complex and carbapenems accounted for 82.3% of all drugs used in SAA group, which may exert effect on the final microbial results. For example, in view of the high degree of drug resistance of the non-fermenting bacteria, antibiotics may kill relatively more sensitive pathogens, such as streptococci spp., H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. Besides, our results suggested that insensitive bacteria and common multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacilli in hospitals are more likely to be isolated after antibiotic exposure, which may further result in the use of unnecessary antibiotics and provide selective pressure in favor of MDR organisms.",

For example, the isolates of non-fermenting bacteria and enterococcus spp. in blood samples were different between the two groups, with separation rates increasing after antibiotic therapy. The same phenomenon occurs in urine cultures. The subgroup analysis of urine samples showed that differences between the two groups were significant. Bidell et al. [19] reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the urine of patients suffering from urinary tract infections is increased in patients with prior antibiotic exposures, but no differences could be found in other pathogens. However, we found that the rates of common microbes such as Enterobacteriaceae, CNS, and Streptococcus spp. decreased after exposure to antimicrobial agents, whereas the isolation rates of non-fermenting bacteria and Candida spp. in the SAA group were higher than those isolated from the SBA group. As far as we know, the latter two are not sensitive or affected by commonly used antimicrobial agents. As for respiratory secretions, we found that the proportions of common community acquired pneumonia pathogens isolated from respiratory secretions in both groups were less than those reported before [20, 21] . Antibiotics having been prescribed before transferring to our hospital, a regional medical center, may account for this difference. Prior antibiotic treatment may reduce respiratory pathogen yield and increase false-positive results [9, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . In fact, frequent and inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary health care settings in China is a serious problem [27] .",

Indeed, the few studies investigating the yield of these clinical specimens after antibiotic exposure are inconsistent. In a study with 2740 episodes of orthopedic infections, Al-Mayahi et al. [28] showed prior antibiotic use, even a single-dose prophylactic administration, was associated with subsequent culture-negative results, non-fermenting rods and resistant skin commensals. Another study conducted by Shahi et al. [7] also demonstrated the negative effect of antibiotic exposure on the culture results. However, some reports suggested that prescribing antibiotic treatment before operative sampling dose not increase the risk of culture-negative results [29, 30] . Therefore, the role of antibiotic administration in these results is unknown, and further research to help identify possible correlations is needed.",

Third, this study was not able to analyze the use of antimicrobial agents before admission and the perioperative antibiotics, which may result in some patients in unsuitable grouping. Besides, we did not analyze whether the antimicrobial agents used for treatment were effective against the cultured microorganisms, and therefore could not speculate on their causal relationship. Finally, this study also did not identify whether these microorganisms were causative pathogens.",
