METHODS: In a retrospective study of all laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections treated at the authors' institution between April 2012 and May 2015, clinical characteristics, risk factors for progression to an LRI, treatment, and outcomes in patients with cancer were determined. RESULTS: In total, 181 hMPV infections were identified in 90 patients (50%) with hematologic malignancies (HMs), in 57 (31%) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, and in 34 patients (19%) with solid tumors. Most patients (92%) had a communityacquired infection and presented with URIs (67%), and 43% developed LRIs (59 presented with LRIs and 19 progressed from a URI to an LRI). On multivariable analysis, an underlying HM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-8.64; P 5.029), nosocomial infection (aOR, 26.9; 95% CI, 2.79-259.75; P 5.004), and hypoxia (oxygen saturation [SpO2], 92%) at presentation (aOR, 9.61; 95% CI, 1.98-46.57; P 5.005) were identified as independent factors associated with LRI. All-cause mortality at 30 days from hMPV diagnosis was low (4%), and patients with LRIs had a 10% mortality rate at day 30 from diagnosis; whereas patients with URIs had a 0% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: hMPV infections in patients with cancer may cause significant morbidity, especially for those with underlying HM who may develop an LRI.

[2] [3] [4] The virus can affect all age groups with upper respiratory infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs); however, severe disease has been described in young children 5 and older adults. 6 The diagnosis of hMPV from respiratory specimens depends on molecular assays (ie, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), which are more sensitive than older methods like direct fluorescent antibody, viral cultures, and serology. 7 In 2012, we adopted a new molecular assay (FilmArray Respiratory Panel; BioFire Diagnostics, LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah), which enhanced the diagnosis of patients with respiratory viral infections secondary to hMPV and other respiratory viruses from respiratory specimens.hMPV infections in immunocompromised hosts have been described in small case series. In patients with cancer, hMPV incidence is similar to that in the immunocompetent population (approximately 7%). 8, 9 hMPVassociated LRI has been reported in as many as 41% of patients with cancer 8 and 100% of children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) . 10 Yet hMPV-associated mortality remains low 8, 9, 11 unless bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings are positive for the virus. 12 These studies were limited by small sample size and inadequate power to determine risk factors and outcomes of hMPV infections in patients with cancer and associated mortality and morbidity. 13 Although supportive measures may be in place, hMPV treatment remains a challenge, because the only in vitro, active drug choice is ribavirin for inhibition of hMPV replication. 14, 15 In addition, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) with or without ribavirin have been used in patients with hMPV infections [16] [17] [18] with lack of systematic evaluation for efficacy. The ECIL 4 European Conference on Infections in Leukemia addressed community-acquired respiratory viruses, including hMPV; however, this therapy lacks systematic evaluation. 19 In this large, retrospective study, our objective was to determine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hMPV infections in patients with cancer who are immunocompromised.

Patients with HM were more likely to progress from URI to LRI than HCT recipients or patients with solid tumors. All patients who died within 30 days from hMPV diagnosis had developed an LRI (mortality rate, 10% in patients with LRI vs 0% in patients with URI). An overall LRI rate of 43% was observed in these patients with cancer. This finding is higher when measured against previous studies, which reported an LRI rate of 28% to 41% in patients who had cancer and an hMPV diagnosis. 22 The incidence of hMPV LRI was consistent with that reported for other respiratory viruses among HCT recipients and patients with HM. 22, 23 Several risk factors associated with LRI were identified. Hypoxia at the time of diagnosis was a substantial risk factor in the multivariable analysis. Hypoxia and a supplemental oxygen requirement at diagnosis are associated with higher rates of LRI and death in patients with cancer who have RSV, PIV, and influenza. 23 Oxygen use may be a surrogate marker for the extent of lung injury, which may lead to poor outcomes. 24 It is interesting to note that an underlying diagnosis of HM significantly increased the risk for LRI. Currently, there are limited data on hMPV infections in patients with HM and their impact; however, underlying HM was reported as a significant risk factor for progression to LRI in patients with PIV-associated respiratory infections. 25 Patients with HM might have a high level of immunosuppression caused by active chemotherapy at the time of hMPV infection or because of their underlying relapsed or refractory disease with subsequent prolonged cytopenias compared with engrafted HCT recipients who are in remission. 26, 27 Nosocomial acquisition of hMPV was associated with a significantly higher risk for hMPV-associated LRI. Substantial numbers of nosocomial hMPV infections also were described in a previous hMPV study of patients with HM. 8 Respiratory viruses can be transmitted from either asymptomatic or symptomatic patients, family members, or health care workers.
