            "text": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection -especially CMV pneumonia -is a major cause of illness and death in immunocompromised patients [1] . Infection with CMV is usually asymptomatic in the immunocompetent host [2] , but there are a few reports of infection or reactivation of CMV with viral detection in blood in patients sepsis [3, 4] . The incidence of such events in blood has been reported to range between 20 and 96% in patients with sep-sis. After primary infection, the virus persists in the host as a latent infection, which can periodically reactivate to cause active infection [2] . The mechanism of reactivation is unknown but enhanced tumor necrosis factor levels may reactivate CMV [4] . White blood cells, especially monocytes, may harbor the latent virus in healthy seropositive individuals [5, 6] , and CMV is known to be transmitted by blood transfusion [7] . It has also been shown that the lung could be a site of CMV latency in humans [8] . The control of CMV replication by the host involves mechanisms of both natural and acquired immunity [9, 10] . The natural  killer cells are the principal effector cells regarding natural   16   immunity, and B-cells and T-cells (especially CD8 T-cells) 14 ~0 are the main components of the acquired immunity. These _~ cell types are interconnected through accessory cells [9, ~_ 12-10] . Critically ill patients frequently demonstrate profound ~ i0immunologic abnormalities as a result of either their ill-\"6 8 ness or its treatment [11] . The present study was therefore _~ 6designed to investigate the hypothesis that critically ill, =E 4 mechanically ventilated, non-immunocompromised patients z 2 could reactivate latent CMV either in blood or lung. 0-We used an in vitro gene amplification technique, the polymerase chain reaction, which has been applied to the detection of CMV DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes Fig. 1 (PBLs) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens [17] [18] [19] . PCR amplification of a 290-bp fragment of the exon 1 of the major immediate early gene was used to test the DNA extracted from blood or BAL cells collected in critically ill, mechanically ventilated, non-immunocompromised patients [20] . Conventional viral culture and rapid culture by the shell vial technique were performed simultaneously [21] . The results obtained failed to demonstrate CMV reactivation in blood or lung from this series of 23 France). According to the manufacturer, such a filter removes ~> 95% of the leukocytes in a unit of normal blood. Ten additional patients with kidney (n=5) or bone marrow (n=5) transplantation and active CMV infection were also studied. Blood and BAL cultures were positive for CMV. These patients constituted the positive control group.",

We have evaluated anti-CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG)-positive patients who had: (a) an expected duration of hospitalisation for at least 5 days; (b) a need for mechanical ventilation; (c) a previous surgical procedure, or a sepsis syndrome, or a pulmonary injury. Upon entry into the study, the hospital records of each patient were reviewed, and the following clinical variables were noted: age, sex, severity of underlying medical conditions stratified according to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson as fatal, ultimately fatal, and non-fatal [22] , first-day Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, which is an index of the severity of illness of patients admitted to an ICU [23] , white blood cell count, serum creatinine, bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase, partial pressure of oxygen fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio, pulmonary impairment determined by the Lung Injury Score described by Murray et al. [24] , duration of admission, and final clinical outcome. The criteria of the sepsis syndrome have been previously reported [25] and include: (1) clinical suspicion of infection; (2) temperature <35.5_+C or >38.3_+C; (3) tachycardia >90 beats min; (4) mechanical ventilation; (5) inadequate organ perfusion or dysfunction as expressed by one of the following: alteration in mental status, hypoxemia (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood <72 mmHg at FIO2=0.21), elevated plasma lactate or oliguria (urine output <30 ml or 0.5 ml/kg for at least 1 h). Septic shock was defined with the above criteria plus: a decrease in systolic arterial pressure (<90 mmHg) despite adequate vascular filling; and need for vasoactive drags (dopamine >5 _+g/kg per min, dobutamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine).",

            "text": "The search for CMV DNA was performed by using PCR amplifying a 290-bp fragment from the first exon of the major CMV immediate early gene [20] . PCR has been reported to be successful in the detection of CMV in blood and BAL cells in CMV infection and has therefore been considered to be a particularly accurate diagnostic method [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Of particular interest from the perspective of PCR is whether it is so sensitive that all infections, latent or active, will be detected. However, our assay did not detect CMV DNA in the blood of normal CMV seropositive healthy controls, as previously reported [19] -a result similar in other studies [12, 13, 16, 17] . Therefore, detection of CMV DNA by PCR could be related to an active CMV infection in the non-immunocompromised host. The choice of primers for amplification requires the use of highly conserved genomic sequences, such as those in the 240-kb CMV genome coding for the major immediate early antigen [27] . When testing DNA extracted from PBLs or BAL cells collected from CMV-infected patients, it was possible to detect the presence of CMV DNA in each of these patients. These patients were tested at random and could therefore be assumed to be infected by different wild strains of CMV. The choice of primers used for PCR in the present study generates the amplification of a sequence that can therefore be considered to be conserved in the various strains of CMV.",

It has been shown that blood transfusion may be responsible for transmission of CMV infection [7] . It is not clearly understood how CMV infection occurs after transfusion. Results favoring both reactivation and reinfection have been reported [31, 32] . Domart et al. reported the presence of CMV viremia in 23 of 115 patients (20%) With mediastinitis follow-ing cardiac surgery [3] . Only 8 of the 22 patients tested were seropositive for CMV before surgery and the viral shedding appeared to be related to perioperative blood transfusions [33] . Since CMV transmission by blood transfusion can be prevented by using leukocyte-poor blood components [34] , we systematically performed blood filtration for the patients in this study. Another study provided substantial results concerning the reactivation of CMV in septic patients with high levels of plasma tumor necrosis factor [4] . In most of the septic patients CMV was demonstrated in blood by either PCR or viral culture after centrifugation, but no signs or symptoms of CMV disease were found in these patients despite their active CMV infection. However, in this study no information on blood transfusion was reported, and some of these patients might have suffered exogenous transmission of CMV. Moreover, the severity of illness, the severity of underlying medical conditions, and the treatment given may have been different from that in our patient population.",
