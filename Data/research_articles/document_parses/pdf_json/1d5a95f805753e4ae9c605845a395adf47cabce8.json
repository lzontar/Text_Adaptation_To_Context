In this study 2000 aerial net-captured houseflies were examined for their ability to harbour Newcastle disease virus (NDV).

Evidence that muscid flies act as mechanical vectors of gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens has been documented widely (Ugbogu et al., 2006) . Outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases in urban and rural areas of countries are closely related to seasonal increases in the abundance of filth flies and fly control is closely related to the decline in cases of enteric diseases (Graczyk et al., 2001) . The housefly reproduces by depositing eggs in a wide variety of decaying organic materials, including manure, mixtures of manure and bedding, and spoiled food. Upon encountering such materials on poultry farms, the adult fly, using its sponging mouth parts, consumes fluids and frequently defecates. As a result of such feeding behaviour, the housefly has been implicated in the transmission of over 30 bacteria, protozoan, viruses and helminth eggs (Greenberg et al., 1970; Kobayashi et al., 1999) . Houseflies can transmit viruses such as polioviruses (Kettle, 1990 ) and coxackie viruses, as well as numerous bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori (Grubel et al., 1997) (Zurek et al., 2001) , Shigella (Levine et al., 1991; Ugbogu et al., 2006) and Vibrio (Kettle, 1990) .

Although virus was not isolated from field-collected flies in this study, NDV has been previously isolated from field-collected houseflies, the lesser housefly, F. canicularis, and the bronze blowfly, Phaenicia cuprina (Wiedemann, 1830), in the U.S.A. (Chakrabarti et al., 2007) . The biology and ecology of M. domestica make it an ideal mechanical vector of human and animal pathogens (Graczyk et al., 2001) . Many viruses have been isolated from the digestive tract of houseflies; Davidson et al. (2005) demonstrated the involvement of houseflies in the transmission of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). Houseflies in this experiment were able to harbour REV in the digestive tract for up to 72 h and could infect chickens (Davidson et al., 2005) . During an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Kyoto, Japan in 2004 , Sawabe et al. (2006 collected a total of 926 flies from six sites within a radius of 2.3 km of the infected poultry farm. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis determined that two blowflies harboured avian influenza virus which had more than 99.9% identities in all three RNA segments to a strain from chicken (A/chicken/Kyoto/3/2004) and crow (A/crow/Kyoto/53/2004) derived during this outbreak. In a study by Calibeo-Hayes et al. (2002) , houseflies were examined for their ability to harbour and transmit Turkey coronavirus (TCV). In laboratory studies, TCV was detected in fly crops up to 9 h post-exposure; no virus was detected in either sham-exposed flies or dissected intestinal tissues. The potential of the housefly to directly transmit TCV to live turkey poults was examined by placing 7-day-old turkey poults in contact with TCV-exposed flies at densities as low as one fly per bird. Antigens of TCV were detected at 3 days post-exposure in the tissues of three of 12 turkeys. However, an increasing rate of exposure was observed with higher fly densities. Rogoff et al. (1977) reported an association of VVNDV with wild flies, especially F. canicularis. They reported the transmission of VVNDV to chickens via exposed F. canicularis. This was the first demonstration of arthropod transmission of ND. It was asserted that F. canicularis is capable of retaining the virus for \u22656 days, that the virus can be transmitted from a highly infected source to healthy birds or from one bird to another and that further experiments should be conducted with M. domestica (Rogoff et al., 1977) . Milushev et al. (1977) reported the involvement of houseflies in the transmission of NDV. The results of this study and others have shown that the housefly is capable of harbouring NDV for up to 72 h post-exposure. No NDV was detected in net-captured houseflies collected from poultry farms; however, NDV has been recovered from field-collected flies and reported in other studies. These results illustrate that houseflies are capable of harbouring NDV and disseminating enteric diseases of poultry.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 234, "end": 248, "text": "(Kettle, 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 249, "end": 270, "text": "Graczyk et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 525, "end": 551, "text": "(Chakrabarti et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 659, "end": 681, "text": "(Graczyk et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 756, "end": 778, "text": "Davidson et al.
