In this paper, we investigate the effect of behavior of wearing masks on epidemic dynamics in the context of COVID-19. At each time, every susceptible individual chooses whether to wear a mask or not in the next time step, which depends on an evaluation of the potential costs and perceived risk of infection. When the cost of infection is high, the majority of the population choose to wear masks, where global awareness plays a significant role. However, if the mask source is limited, global awareness may give rise to a negative result. In this case, more mask source should be allocated to the individuals with high risk of infection.",

Moreover, different from the perfect protection measures such as vaccination [6, 7] , the masks can only reduce the risk of infection to some extent. In this paper, we investigate the effect of behavior of wearing masks on epidemic dynamics in the context of COVID-19. Inspired by game theory [8] [9] [10] [11] , the decision of each individual about whether to wear a mask or not depends on an evaluation of his/her potential costs and perceived risk of infection. The perceived risk mainly relies on two kinds of sources: local infection information and global infection information [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Herein, in calculating the risk of infection, we call the situation of local information and global information being involved as local awareness and global awareness, respectively. Furthermore, considering the protection of masks has the time-effectiveness, the individuals' behavior is time-dependent. That is, the individuals may change their decisions as the disease evolves.",

And, which factor contributes to this phenomenon? The other one is that, what effect does global awareness have on epidemic dynamics? The results show that, when the cost of infection is high, the majority of the population trend to wear masks. The impact of global awareness includes two aspects. On the one hand, global awareness can motivate more individuals to wear masks, which is beneficial to epidemic control. On the other hand, once global awareness causes a herd behavior, fewer individuals with high risk of infection can obtain protection due to a limit on mask source, which may instead increase the disease outbreak.",

The classical SEIR model is also the sample of up-to-date works of COVID-19 [17, 18] . The epidemic dynamics are described as follows. At each time step, one susceptible individual, say i, may get the infection from any of its infectious neighbors, who have the capability to infect others, with the baseline infection probability \u03bb 1 independently. Considering that some recent studies have suggested that a few people may have the infectivity in the incubation period [4] , expect the symptomatic individuals, the infectious individuals also include a part of the exposed individuals, which has great significance for the following decision-making process. Once infected, the individual i will be transferred into the exposed compartment and some symptoms, such as, fever and cough, appear after e i time steps. For the symptomatic individual i, there are m i time steps used for self-observation. After that, the individual i chooses to go to hospital and finally is quarantined. The quarantined individuals have no chance of transmitting the virus. Here, for the sake of simplification, it is assumed that, before d i time steps prior to the symptoms, the individual i becomes capable to infect others.",

The other choice is not to take the measure with payoff 0. Under each choice, the susceptible individuals still have the possibility of being infected with payoff \u2212c 0 , the cost of drugs, cures and so on. The decision depends on the difference in the average expected payoffs for two choices, denoted by \u03c0 Y i and \u03c0 N i for node i.

First, we focus on the effect of infection payoff c 0 on epidemic dynamics. From Fig. 1 , it can be seen that, as c 0 increases, the fraction of individuals who wear masks grow remarkably (see the blue squares). In particular, when c 0 = 500, almost all susceptible individuals choose to wear masks soon after the epidemic begins to spread. It is expected, since, compared to the high cost for infection, cheap masks have a greater advantage. However, we also see that, the final fraction of quarantined individuals drops slightly with c 0 increasing. This is because, the susceptible individuals with the infectious neighbors only can benefit from precautionary measure. According to our mechanism described in Sect. 2, the large value of c 0 does not bring about the obvious change in the decisions of the individuals who have the symptomatic neighbors (see the green squares), while, due to a small decrease in the total infection probability by precautionary measure, the majority of the increased individuals, who wear masks and have the infectious neighbors in the incubation period only, cannot escape from infection in the end (see the yellow squares).",

The significance of global awareness is in reinforcing the choices of the individuals who have no symptomatic neighbors (see the red squares and yellow squares in Fig. 1 ). In addition, Figs. 1 and 2 also show that, due to the introduction of global awareness, the final fraction of quarantined individuals decreases at the cost of the considerable mask source.

For this enormous need of masks, a society cannot often afford. So, it is necessary to discuss the case of the limited supply of mask source. Figure 3 shows the time evolution of epidemic dynamics under the limited mask source. At each time, a fraction l of individuals can obtain masks at most. Once the total need exceeds the limit, the fraction l of individuals are chosen from the individuals who intend to wear masks at random and obtain masks. In Fig. 3 , we see, with c 0 increasing, the time scale that the need is restricted increases. Compared with the case of no limit, the fraction of the individuals, who wear masks and have the symptomatic neighbors, decreases, while the final fraction of quarantined individuals increases, and, is even greater than the one in the case of local awareness only, see Fig. 4 .",

At each time, every susceptible individual has to choose whether to take the measure or not, according to an evaluation of his/her potential costs and perceived risk of infection, involving local awareness and global awareness. The simulation results show that, when c 0 is large, global awareness stimulates more individuals to take the measure, particularly the ones who have no symptomatic neighbors, and, thus, the final fraction of quarantined individuals decreases. On the other hand, due to the limit of mask source, it is likely that the individuals with high infection risk cannot get protection against the infection from precautionary measure and is infected. Therefore, global awareness has twofold effect: positive and negative one.",
