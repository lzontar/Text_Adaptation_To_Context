No study has ever focused on its clinical relevance in the lower respiratory tract of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation. The aims were to describe the characteristics of ICU patients with a C. spp. positive deep respiratory specimen, to investigate the impact of C. spp. on the occurrence of pneumonia, and to evaluate the outcomes of these pneumonia. Methods We retrospectively included all adult patients admitted to ICU in a 1000-bed University Hospital (2007-2017) who had a C. spp. positive lower respiratory tract specimen at a significant quantitative level. We used clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria to classify the likelihood of such pneumonia. Results Among the 31 patients included, acute respiratory failure and postoperative care after major surgery were the main reasons of admission. SAPS II was 47 . C. spp. pneumonia was considered as probable, possible and unlikely in 10, 14, and 7 patients, respectively. Fifty-two and 94% of C. spp. strains were sensitive to amoxicillin, and vancomycin/linezolid, respectively. Seventeen patients had a complete course of antibiotic against C. spp. The overall ICU mortality was 58%.

Interestingly, Llitjos et al. have recently highlighted that a first episode of pneumonia promotes the onset of further episodes, due to initial lung damages [21] . However, we chose not to consider viral co-infections to discriminate the proper role of C. spp., and as the impact of viral pneumonia, due to viruses such as Herpes Simplex or Cytomegalovirus is highly debatable in critically ill patients [22] . Moreover, isolation of viruses requires B-BAL, which was rarely performed because NB-PTC is the historical technique of choice in our institution [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 619, "end": 623, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1023, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In our cohort, more than half of the C. spp. strains were sensitive to amoxicillin, and the majority were sensitive to vancomycin, linezolid, gentamicin, rifampicin and imipenem. This is in accordance with the reported susceptibility of C. spp. in the literature, as most of these bacteria are commonly considered sensitive to \u00df-lactam, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides agents, and resistant to macrolides, clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones and/or rifampicin [7, 8, 10, 24] . In our cohort, only one isolate was resistant to vancomycin and linezolid and one third of isolates were resistant to cefotaxime. Resistance to cefotaxime may be here explained by the prior exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and the high potential of microorganisms to select drug-resistant strains in ICU. However, some species, including C. jeikeium, C. macginleyi and C. xerosis are resistant to \u00df-lactam and require glycopeptides; C. propinquum and C. striatum are inconsistently sensitive to penicillin and cephalosporins. Thus, profiles of antimicrobial sensitivity of C. spp. are considered unpredictable [10, 24, 25] and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been increasingly reported so far [12, 26] . In addition, S  52  52  58  84  10  77  74  94  94  I  13  10  3  3  13  0  6  0  0  R  29  13  29  3  67  20  17  3  3  N/A  6  25  10  10  10  3  3  3  3 Campanile et al. reported 36 multidrug-resistant strains of C. striatum strongly associated with devices such as tracheal tubes or catheters [26] . Overall, these data might advocate for a short empirical treatment with vancomycin or linezolid as soon as C. spp. is isolated from respiratory specimens with clinical feature consistent with severe pneumonia. This antimicrobial therapy should then be tailored based on species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing results. In our cohort, less than half of the patients with C. spp. pneumonia survived, highlighting the critical status of this population. The respective parts of direct attributable responsibility of C. spp., or the absence of antimicrobial therapy in patients who had probable C. spp. pneumonia but who were left specifically untreated, remains to be elucidated. No conclusion can be drawn about the association between C. spp. and patient outcome, because of the small number of patients, the specific weight of comorbidities, and the absence of control population. Underlying comorbidities may have a stronger impact on outcome that the pneumonia itself, as suggested by the analysis of causes of death, as well as the delay between C. spp. pneumonia and death.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 487, "end": 490, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 491, "end": 493, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 494, "end": 497, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 498, "end": 501, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1124, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1128, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1132, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1221, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1222, "end": 1225, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1529, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1241, "end": 1383, "text": "S  52  52  58  84  10  77  74  94  94  I  13  10  3  3  13  0  6  0  0  R  29  13  29  3  67  20  17  3  3  N/A  6  25  10  10  10  3  3  3  3", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has several strengths. It is the first study focusing on the clinical relevance of C. spp. in critically ill patients. Classification of clinical relevance into probable, possible or unlikely was independently evaluated by independent investigators. There were blinded to each other, limiting classification bias with only three patients classified by consensus due to different assessments. We used only quantitative cultures of specimens obtained with invasive diagnostic techniques, to avoid contamination from the upper respiratory tract. These data can be helpful for critical care physicians challenged by a C. spp. positive deep respiratory specimen in a setting of pneumonia.

As in all previous studies on the clinical relevance of C. spp., data were analyzed retrospectively and the small number of isolates prevents from performing statistical analysis. For the same reason, we were not able to evaluate the clinical response of treating these infections: even if it seems justified to treat C. spp. when its impact is high in a setting of pneumonia, this strategy does not seem to lower mortality, probably due to the overall morbidity of the patients. The low incidence of C. spp. isolation also prevents from performing prospective studies. The clinical diagnosis of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients remains challenging and controversial and we acknowledge that despite reaching consensus, some cases may have been debatable. In addition, we chose to classify the clinical features of pneumonia as probable, possible or unlikely, as thresholds may not be always as clear as infection or colonization. As developed in others fields of critical care medicine [27] , this classification allows a \"grey zone\" approach, which is closer from the real life. The small number of patients has restricted the statistical analysis and precluded assessment of risk factors of infection. Moreover, the majority of the patients had co-infections and received complete antibiotic courses covering C. spp. isolates, even when the latter may have not been considered as a causative pathogen by clinicians. In addition, the fact that half of the samples containing C.spp. were not considered or treated, outlines the difficulties to assess and manage these patients. Finally, as the MALDI-TOF has only been implemented since 2015 in our institution, we were not able to identify all the Corynebacteria subspecies. In our cohort, we were not able to describe potential temporal trends in C. spp. antimicrobial sensitivity, due to the low number of strains.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1039, "end": 1043, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This study, focusing on critically ill patients, shows that C. spp. seems to be responsible for pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.
