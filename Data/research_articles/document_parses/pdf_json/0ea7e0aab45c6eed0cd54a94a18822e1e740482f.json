To reveal the relationship between lipids and preeclampsia, we conduct lipidomic profiling of maternal serums of 44 severe preeclamptic and 20 healthy pregnancies from a multi-ethnic cohort in Hawaii. Correlation network analysis shows that oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) have increased inter-correlations and connections in preeclampsia, while other lipids, including triacylglycerols (TAGs), have reduced network correlations and connections. Thirty-one lipid species from various lipid classes demonstrate predominantly reductions and causal relationships with preeclampsia. They include phosphatidylglycerol (PG), TAG, diacylglycerol (DAG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol esters (CE), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), ceramides (Cer-NS), hexosyl ceramides (HexCer-NS), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and free fatty acid (FFA).

It is a leading cause of maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (Saleem et al. 2014) . Depending on the onset time, preeclampsia can be categorized as early onset preeclampsia (EOPE, < 34 weeks) and late onset preeclampsia (LOPE). EOPE is a more severe form and is associated with shallow placental implantation into the uterine wall and subsequent placental dysfunction (Raymond and Peterson 2011) . Alternatively, preeclampsia can be classified as mild or severe type based on the severity of the symptoms. For severe preeclampsia, the mothers often suffer from potentially fatal pathological manifestations including hypertension, proteinuria, liver rupture, pulmonary edema, and kidney failure (Souza et al. 2013) . Moreover, women who had preeclampsia previously have shown 2-3 folds higher risks at developing cardiovascular diseases (CVS) later in life (Leon et al. 2019) . The adverse impacts on the fetus include intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery. Despite the severity of this condition, few effective treatments are available except expectant management. Delivery of the placenta is the only cure, but this is often coupled with preterm delivery of the fetus (Vigil-De Gracia et al. 2013) , with associated life-long health issues in offspring, such as neurodevelopmental disorders and long-term adult onset disorders (Batalle et al. 2012 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 188, "text": "(Jeyabalan 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 310, "end": 330, "text": "(Saleem et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 617, "end": 644, "text": "(Raymond and Peterson 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 944, "end": 963, "text": "(Souza et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1124, "text": "(Leon et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1463, "text": "(Vigil-De Gracia et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1613, "text": "(Batalle et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Many efforts have been made to systematically understand the biological processes altered in this syndrome, as well as identify potential biomarkers using genomics platforms such as DNA methylation, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics.
