            "text": "Background: Rickettsialpox is a febrile illness caused by the mite-borne pathogen Rickettsia akari. Several cases of this disease are reported worldwide annually. Nevertheless, the relationship between the immunogenicity of R. akari and disease development is still poorly understood. Thus, misdiagnosis is frequent. Our study is aiming to identify immunogenic proteins that may improve disease recognition and enhance subsequent treatment. To achieve this goal, two proteomics methodologies were applied, followed by immunoblot confirmation. Results: Three hundred and sixteen unique proteins were identified in the whole-cell extract of R. akari. The most represented protein groups were found to be those involved in translation, post-translational modifications, energy production, and cell wall development. A significant number of proteins belonged to amino acid transport and intracellular trafficking. Also, some proteins affecting the virulence were detected. In silico analysis of membrane enriched proteins revealed 25 putative outer membrane proteins containing beta-barrel structure and 11 proteins having a secretion signal peptide sequence. Using rabbit and human sera, various immunoreactive proteins were identified from which the 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) has demonstrated a unique detection capability. It positively distinguished the sera of patients with Rickettsialpox from other rickettsiae positive human sera. Conclusion: Our proteomic analysis certainly contributed to the lack of knowledge of R. akari pathogenesis. The result obtained may also serve as a guideline for a more accurate diagnosis of rickettsial diseases. The identified 44 kDa uncharacterized protein can be certainly used as a unique marker of rickettsialpox or as a target molecule for the development of more effective treatment.",

            "text": "From the clinical and antigenic perspective, Rickettsia species (Order Rickettsiales, Family Rickettsiaceae) are obligate intracellular gram-negative alpha-proteobacteria that diverged into three major phylogenetic groups [1] [2] [3] . This includes the typhus group (TG), spotted fever group (SFG), and the transitional group of Rickettsia (TRG). Rickettsia akari, the causative agent of Rickettsialpox, was originally classified into the SFG. However, current genomic studies suggested placing this organism together with R. australis and R. felis into the TRG [4, 5] . This pathogen is usually transmitted to humans and animals by the rodent mites Liponyssoides sanguineus [6, 7] . Nevertheless, it was also detected in the mite Leptotrombidium scutellare [8] and Korean voles Microtus fortis pelliceus [9] . Rickettsialpox was first described in New York City in 1946 [10] and has been since reported in diverse parts of Europe, Asia and North America [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Patients suffering from this illness describe fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, and eschar at the site of the mite bite. Early in the febrile course of the disease, a maculopapular eruption with intraepidermal vesicles usually appears, sparing the palms and soles of the feet [17] . But due to similar symptoms, it is often confused with cutaneous anthrax or smallpox [18, 19] . Thus, it was recommended to confirm the clinical observations with serological testing. Although a high level of cross-reactivity in antibody responses is noted between R. akari and other rickettsiae from the Spotted fever group [20] .",

Particularly, the complete genome sequence of R. akari comprises 1.23 megabase pairs containing 1013 protein-coding genes, 274 pseudogenes, and 39 RNA genes (gene bank accession No. CP000847). This feature is a consequence of invariable genome reduction caused by specialization to a restricted set of hosts during adaptation to the parasitic lifestyle [21] . Further analysis of rickettsial genomes, including R. akari, showed a number of split genes and palindromic elements inserted into genes [2] . Some data are also available from proteomic investigations of Rickettsia species [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . The majority of identified proteins play a crucial role in the mechanism of pathogenesis and virulence of the bacteria. Proteins, however, may also act in antibiotic resistance [28] and host-specific immune response. Recent investigations on rickettsia-host interactions have also identified several important proteins involved in rickettsial adhesion and/or invasion as well as activation of host-cell signaling [29] .",

According to this classification, 27.4% of proteins are involved in translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (COG: J); 9% in energy production and conversion (COG: C); 8.3% in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (COG: M); 6.9% in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones (COG: O); 5.6% in intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport (COG: U); 4.5% in amino acid transport and metabolism (COG: E); 4.2% in transcription (COG: K) 9.4% with unknown function (COG: S) and 3.5% non-belong to orthologous group (NOG). The remaining 21.2% of proteins belong to 17 other COGs (A, CO, D, F, FG, FP, G, H, I, IQ, L, MU, OU, P, PQ, T, V) in the share of 0.3 to 2.8% (Fig. 1 ). Surface-exposed and envelope associated proteins (SEPs) SEPs of R. akari represent an essential interface in pathogen-host interactions. To recognize these proteins, two membrane-enriched rickettsial extracts were prepared as detailed in the materials and method section. In the first, the cell-impermeant reagent, Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, was used to label SEPs. The biotinylated proteins were then isolated by streptavidin agarose affinity purification. On the other hand, the second protocol was based on the Triton X-114 phase partitioning. This nonionic detergent substitutes the lipid molecules interacting with the hydrophobic domain of integral membrane proteins and forms soluble protein-detergent micelles. After temperature changes, phase separation occurs. Hydrophobic proteins aggregate in the detergent phase, while the hydrophilic remain in the aqueous layer [30] . All the obtained fractions were then separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Using these approaches\u00b8we identified 83 unique R. akari proteins with molecular masses range from 5.5 to 168.0 kDa and pI from 4.6 to 12.1. Fourteen of these proteins were recognized with both approaches, including OmpB (A8GPL7), chaperone protein DnaK (A8GMF9), 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL (A8GPB6), ATP synthase subunit alpha (A8GPZ6), a 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63), superoxide dismutase (A8GNP0), putative adhesin A1C_06425 (A8GQ33), thioredoxin peroxidase 1 (A8GN15), inorganic pyrophosphatase (A8GP57), stress-induced DNA-binding protein (A8GPZ9), nucleoside diphosphate kinase (A8GLZ8), 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (A8GMA6), 10 kDa chaperonin (A8GPB7) and 7 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GNR0).",

This group was tightly followed by enzymes involved in the processes of central metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Four key enzymes of TCA cycle, which have been shown to be complete in Rickettsiae (KEGG, MAP 00020) were detected in this study, namely malate dehydrogenase (A8GN82) citrate synthase (A8GQ56), acetyltransferase component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (A8GNQ3), and 2 subunits (alpha and beta) of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component (A8GMR3 and A8GMR4 respectively). Despite the evidence of a functional presence of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and TCA cycle, it was shown that Rickettsia spp. cannot metabolize (glycolysis) or generate (gluconeogenesis) glucose [36] . Neither pyruvate can be synthesized due to the lack of metabolic pathways necessary for pyruvate synthesis [37] . Therefore, glucose and pyruvate should be uptaken directly or in the form of phosphoenolpyruvate from the host cells cytoplasm to support ATP generation via the TCA cycle [23] . In this case, phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to pyruvate by pyruvate phosphate dikinase (A8GNN4), which was detected in this study. Nevertheless, ATP can be synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation. The presence of four ATP synthase subunits (A8GPZ3, A8GPZ4, A8GPZ6, A8GPZ7) illustrates the importance of this pathway in Rickettsiae that is necessary to compensate for glycolysis defect [23] .",

            "text": "In addition to exogenous uptake of major energy sources including glucose, ATP and NAD + [36] , Rickettsiae as intracellular organisms possess refined secretion mechanisms to translocate various effector proteins into the host cell in order to sustain survival. They are equipped with various types of secretion systems, including the Sec or Tat translocation pathways, type I secretion system (T1SS), type IV secretion system (T4SS), and type V autotransporter pathways (T5SS) [38] . As in earlier rickettsial proteome studies [22, 25] , we identified several proteins of Sec-mediated translocation system, namely protein translocase subunit SecD (A8GP54), Sec translocon accessory complex subunit YajC (A8GP53), signal recognition particle receptor FtsY (A8GPW4), preprotein translocase subunit SecG (A8GM25), and a protein-export membrane protein SecG (A8GM27), that is unique to all rickettsiae [23, 25] . We also identified two out of the three major structural features of the T1SS, namely outer membrane efflux protein (A8GMM0) belonging to the TolC family [38] and a putative ABC transporter ATP-binding component (A8GM03). This protein is a constituent of ATP-binding cassette transporters that play a role in multidrug resistance [23, 39] . Moreover, we detected three components of T4SS, namely TrbL/VirB6 plasmid conjugative transfer proteins (A8GM63-67), VirB4 family protein (A8GM62), and VirD4 protein (A8GMV1). The last interact with a VirB4 protein and the ATPases VirB11 independently of other subunits and forms the ATPase complex that dock to the inner membrane. The VirD4 also acts as a receptor that may transport substrates to the translocation channel [40, 41] . Meanwhile, VirB6 is the key polytopic membrane protein forming the inner membrane channel that is essential for substrate secretion (Additional file 1).",

            "text": "Secreted proteins and SEPs play a key role in pathogen-host interactions by allowing infection of the host cell and promoting bacterial replication in the cytosol [34] ; hence identification of these important molecules is essential. Obviously, the surface cell antigen (Sca) family proteins are undoubtedly included among the most dominant SEPs which play an important role in rickettsial pathogenesis [42] [43] [44] . Previous studies indicated that two major Sca proteins, outer membrane protein A (Sca0 or OmpA) and OmpB (Sca5), might play key roles in the adhesion of the Rickettsia cells to the host tissue [42, [44] [45] [46] . These molecules are likely major antigenic determinants of Rickettsia spp and represent good candidates for vaccine development. Nucleotide sequences of these proteins were even used for phylogenetic determination. While OmpB (A8GPL7) has been identified in several Rickettsia spp. including R. akari (in this study), the presence of OmpA was reported only in the SFG [47] . The latest protein is mostly not encoded in the genomes of TG Rickettsia [34] . Further evaluation of the identified proteins has revealed many similar SEPs as in other Rickettsiae, including the OmpB (A8GPL7), putative adhesin (A8GQ33), heat shock protein (A8GMS9), and chaperone proteins DnaK (A8GMF9) and GroEL (A8GPB6). Using enrichment protocols, we also detected the cell division coordinator CpoB (A8GMM6) surface protein, the TolB protein (A8GMX9), and the actin polymerization protein RickA (A8GP67). The CpoB was previously described as a YbgF protective antigen [27] . Together with TolB, these periplasmic proteins are essential for the Tol-Pal system, which has a role in the maintenance of cell envelope integrity. These proteins may also participate in translocation of virulence factors [48] . On the other hand, the identification of actin polymerization protein RickA (A8GP67), an activator of the host Arp2/3 complex, may indicate the actin-based motility of R. akari [49, 50] . Thus this protein could be proposed as an important factor of virulence in SFG Rickettsia. It promotes spreading among host cells, unlike the Typhus group members [51, 52] .",

For this propose, the whole-cell extract was analyzed using a two-dimensional immunoblot technique coupled to LC-MS/MS identification. Under our experimental conditions, a strong immunological response of R. akari lipopolysaccharide against the polyclonal sera of infected rabbit and positive patient sera was evident. Nevertheless, among the proteins with predicted beta-barrel structure, which were proposed to be R. akari SEPs, we detected only four immunoreactive antigens, namely chaperone proteins GroEL (A8GPB6) and DnaK (A8GMF9), outer membrane protein B (A8GPL7), and an uncharacterized protein (A8GP63). Heat shock proteins GroEL and DnaK are the most frequently detected immunoreactive proteins with high abundance in Ricketssiae, as it was indicated in many previous studies on R. felis, R. conorii, R. helvetica, and R. rickettsii [24, 25, 53] . The upregulation of groEL and dnak was also described in R. prowazekii as a response to heat shock exposure [54] . According to our shotgun label-free proteomic quantitation (LFQ), proteins GroEL and DnaK belong to the most abundant proteins of R. akari, with LFQ values 35.8 and 32.2, respectively, whereas the average value of all identified proteins achieved 26.4. Interestingly, one of the uncharacterized proteins, the 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) also seems to be abundant as it reached the LFQ value of 30.1.",

            "text": "So far, no evidence was published concerning this uncharacterized protein (A8GP63). The protein homology search showed very high sequence similarity with two unknown orthologous proteins from R. australis (H8K6W8) and R. felis (Q4UMI2). However, only a very low similarity was noted to other SFG rickettsiae (Fig. 4a) . This is in line with the classification to TRG of Rickettsia since R. akari is phylogenetically related the most closely to R. australis and R. felis [4] . To better describe this unique protein, it was prepared by ectopic expression in E. coli. At the same time, we also produced the highly abundant 60 kDa (GroEL) and 70 kDa (DnaK) of R. akari for comparative purposes. Then, these recombinant proteins were tested against 3 positive sera from Rickettsialpox patients and 2 positive patient sera with spotted fever group rickettsiosis. As we predicted, all positive patient sera distinguished the recombinant proteins GroEL and DnaK. However, the 44 kDa unknown protein was recognized exclusively with the positive sera from Rickettsialpox patients. Moreover, IFA using specific mouse serum against this 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) together with precise bioinformatics suggested membrane association. Thus, the 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) appears to be a valuable biomarker of R. akari.",

            "text": "This paper represents the first comprehensive proteomic study of R. akari that was accomplished using gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches. Altogether we identified 316 unique proteins that correspond to 31.2% of 1013 protein-coding genes annotated in the R. akari genome. From them, 33 proteins found in the cell envelope enrichment fractions were predicted as outer membrane proteins or proteins possessing a signal peptide or a beta-barrel structure indicating membrane association. These proteins were proposed as R. akari SEPs that may play a key role in pathogen-host interactions. However, antigenic protein seems to be the most important in terms of effective vaccine development and the discovery of new biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. Among these proteins, we recognized an immunodominant 44 kDa uncharacterized protein (A8GP63) that was not yet described in any Rickettsiae. It seems this protein has betabarrel structures indicating outer membrane character which was proved by IFA. In addition, the protein shows significant immunoreactivity against the sera of patients with Rickettsialpox. Thus, the 44 kDa putative outer membrane protein (A8GP63) represents a good candidate for improved differential diagnosis of rickettsial diseases especially those caused by TRG of Rickettsia.",

Blood samples from the both experiments were collected at the 7th day after the booster by cardiac puncture under general anesthesia with sodium thiopental (for mice 50 mg/kg and 20 mg/ kg for rabbit). Mice were sacrified by cervical dislocation and the rabbit was euthanized by intravenose overdose (100 mg/kg) of sodium thiopental (VUAB pharma, Czech republic). All animal experiments were conducted in the experimental animal facility at Biomedical Research Center of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (BMC, SAS) in accordance with the European Directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and were approved by the ethical committee of BMC, SAS. The IgG titers of animal sera were determined by ELISA using the corresponding antigen.",
