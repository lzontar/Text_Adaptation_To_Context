Serological testing is useful for diagnosis and characterization of the course of the disease, identification of convalescent plasma donors, for epidemiology studies, lockdown exit programs and COVID-19 vaccine development [2, 3] . Due to the widespread dissemination of these new methods and the limited experience with these assays, it is crucial for laboratories to rigorously validate these methods before broad introduction into routine clinical practice.",

Serum samples (n=140) obtained from 97 patients with a confirmed RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were used to determine the clinical sensitivity of the assay. RT-PCR on respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal swab samples) was performed on the LightCycler \u00ae 480 Instrument II using the LightMix \u00ae Modular SARS-CoV-2 E-gene set (Roche Diagnostics \u00ae ). Serum samples were subdivided into different categories based on the number of days after a positive RT-PCR test as follows: . Among the 60 samples collected 14 or more days after the RT-PCR positive detection, and using the manufacturer's cut-off, the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay identified 55 true positive and 5 false negative samples. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.7% (95%CI: 81.6-97.2%). Using the optimal cut-off provided by ROC curve analyses (i.e.>0.165) improved the performance of the test to give a sensitivity of 100% (95%CI: 94.0-100%) (Figure 1). A sensitivity analysis was also performed considering the date of symptom onset. Among the 97 patients, data about time of symptom onset were available for 92 patients. The collected samples (n=129) were subdivided into different categories according to the number of days after the onset of symptoms as follows: 0-6 days: 22 sera; 7-13 days: 28 sera; 14-20 days: 26 sera; 21-27 days: 23 sera; 28 days or more: 30 sera. Among the 79 samples evaluated 14 or more days after the onset of symptoms, and using the manufacturer's cut-off, the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay identified 72 true positive and 7 false negative samples. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.1% (95%CI: 82.6-96.4%). Using the ROC curve cut-off (i.e.>0.165) improved the performance of the tests with a sensitivity of 95.1% (95%CI: 88.0-98.7%).",
