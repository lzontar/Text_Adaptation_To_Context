Studies suggested that obesity was a major risk factor for its hospitalization and severity of symptoms. This study investigated the associations between obesity prevalence with overall COVID-19 cases and related deaths across states in the United States. General regression and Chisquare tests were used to examine those associations. The analyses indicated that obesity prevalence (%) across states were negatively associated with COVID-19 cases (p = 0.0448) and related deaths (p = 0.0181), with a decrease of 158 cases/100K population and 13 deaths/100K for every 5% increase of the obesity prevalence. When the states were divided based on the median of obesity prevalence (30.9%) into a group of states with low obesity prevalence and a group with high obesity prevalence, both the cases (671 vs 416 cases/100k population) and deaths (39 vs 21 deaths/100k population) were significantly different (p < 0.001) across groups. These findings provided important information for the relationship between the dual pandemic threats of obesity and COVID-19.
