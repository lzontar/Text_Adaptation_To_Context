The evidence update identified 6 new studies: 4 observational studies (3) (4) (5) (6) addressed use of hydroxychloroquine alone, 1 observational study (7) focused on hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin, and 1 observational study (8) assessed use of chloroquine alone (previously, no studies were available on the use of chloroquine alone). All new studies evaluated use of the pharmacologic interventions for treatment of COVID-19. The new evidence added support to previous conclusions but resulted in no conceptual changes to the practice points (see the next section and the Table) . The Supplement summarizes the evidence, evidence gaps, and clinical considerations.",
