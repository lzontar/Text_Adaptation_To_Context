            "text": "The lung is the predominant disease site in COVID-19 infection and may lead to the so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection [2] . COVID-19 infects human cells through its spike surface glycoprotein that binds to the receptor-binding domains of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in epithelial cells of the tongue and type II alveolar cells [3, 4] . After binding to the ciliated cells in the alveoli, the virion releases RNA into the cell, initiating replication of the virus which further disseminates to infect other cells. As a consequence, the infected cells likely stop clearing the airways with a consequent progressive accumulation of debris and fluids in the lungs [5] [6] [7] . The first non-severe stage of lung involvement by COVID-19, with only mild symptoms, may be attributed to the direct viral damage and innate immune response. The second severe stage, with progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, may be attributed to tissue damage by specific immune response (the so-called cytokine release syndrome) [8] . Imaging allows to identify and grade the extent of the COVID-19 disease [2] . In this essay, we collected the imaging and clinical experience from multiple Italian centers involved in the COVID-19 outbreak, including two nonacademic hospitals and one academic hospital in Lombardy (the most affected Italian region) that acquired each about 30-60 radiographies and CT scans per day in COVID-19 patients and one academic hospital in Sicily (one of the least affected Italian region).",

The choice of imaging technique depends on equipment availability and clinical context, as well as national/ regional needs and recommendations [2, 9] . Lung ultrasound has been proposed in suspected COVID-19 patients as a potential triage and diagnostic tool in tents or other areas outside hospitals where other imaging modalities are not available because it allows to rapidly triage patients through Fig. 1 A 56-year-old man with fever, cough, and positive for COVID-19. Chest radiograph (a, b) shows no significant lung abnormalities. Coronal (c) and sagittal (d) CT images demonstrate subpleural consolidations and ground-glass opacities in the right lower lobe (arrows) the identification of thickened and irregular pleural line and B lines in a variety of patterns [9, 10] . We speculated that it could be useful also in monitoring hospitalized ventilated or intubated COVID-19 patients. However, in our experience, CXR and CT scan were performed rather than lung ultrasound in hospitalized patients to monitor lung involvement. Indeed, ultrasound has a limited sensitivity and specificity for the assessment of lung diseases because it has a limited capability in detecting pulmonary lesions that are deep and intrapulmonary and ultrasound findings of COVID-19 overlap with those from other viral pneumonia. CXR and CT are currently used in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia [2] . Baseline CXR and chest CT have a sensitivity of 69% and 97% for the diagnosis of COVID-19, respectively ( Fig. 1) [11] [12] [13] . CT may allow to detect COVID-19 pneumonia even before real-time PCR [12, 13] . However, the huge drawback of CT is its low specificity (i.e., 25-56%) for COVID-19 pneumonia [12, 13] , due to overlapping of imaging features with other viral or atypical pneumonia [14, 15] . ",

CXR has a pivotal role in hospitalized patients for assessing disease progression, bacterial superinfection, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion [2] . In the intermediate to advanced stages of the disease, CXR may show progression of imaging features of acute respiratory distress syndrome in intensive care unit (ICU) patients (Fig. 2) and may help in guiding patient management [17] . However, CXR is not needed on a daily basis in stable intubated patients in ICU as there is no impact on important outcomes (mortality, length of stay, and ventilator days) as compared with on-demand CXR [18, 19] .",

To date, about 3% of currently infected patients has serious or critical conditions [25] , and about 17% of hospitalized patients needs ICU admission [26, 27] . Radiologists may be helpful in identifying patients at higher risk of lung disease worsening. Indeed, the presence of tubular size increase of pulmonary segmental vessel around and within the lesions with normally ventilated adjacent lung parenchyma (Fig. 12) has been suggested as an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration [28] . Indeed, some authors believe that the presence of enlarged pulmonary vessels may indicate an inflammatory cell infiltration of the vessels [29] or might be due to pro-inflammatory Fig. 11 Chest radiograph patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia. a An 84year-old man with hypotension and dyspnea since 7 days: CXR shows Kerley lines (frames) perpendicular to the pleura. b 68-year-old man with dyspnea and fever since 7 days and who died after 5 days: CXR shows consolidative pattern and ground-glass opacities. c A 55-year-old man with fever and dyspnea since 4 days: CXR shows combination of the reticular and consolidative patterns (frame) Fig. 12 An 83-year-old woman with COVID-19 pneumonia. Chest CT angiography reconstructed using maximum intensity projection (MIP) demonstrates enlargement of pulmonary segmental vessel and peripheral ground-glass opacities factors [30] , thus potentially indicating that the patient is in the second stage of COVID-19 lung involvement.",

CXR and CT may demonstrate findings of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fig. 13 ) including bilateral opacities, not fully explained by volume overload, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules [31] . The most common CT finding of ARDS is the presence of large lung infiltrates with loss of ventilation, especially in the posterior and basal regions, with ground-glass opacities alternating with consolidations [32] . However, imaging findings of ARDS vary depending on the stage of the disease ranging from an exudative acute phase in the first week characterized by bilateral and symmetrical air space and interstitial opacities on CXR, and opacifications showing an antero-posterior density gradient characterized by dense bilateral consolidation in the dependent lung and a background of widespread GGO or normal lung in the nondepended portions of the lung, to a proliferative intermediate phase in the second week with overall stability of the imaging findings and a fibrotic late phase after 2 weeks with normal or reticular opacities on CXR, and eventually a coarse reticular pattern with areas of fine fibrosis on CT (Fig. 14) [32] . It is important to identify patients with COVID-19 pneumonia progressing to ARDS because these patients could benefit from corticosteroid treatment according to Xu et al. [6] . In addition, in patients with severe ARDS, prone ventilation for 12-16 h per day is indicated by World Health Organization Interim guidance because it improves oxygenation and respiratory compliance compared with supine positioning [33, 34] . Chest imaging is also considered important in World Health Organization Interim guidance V 1.2 when findings of pulmonary edema are evident because, in these cases, it is indicated to reduce or discontinue fluid administration to avoid volume overload [33] .",
