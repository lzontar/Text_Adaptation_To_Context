Laboratory testing of D-dimer should 365 be considered for pregnant women with Covid-19. 366 367 Pregnant women typically represent a unique and vulnerable group to infectious 368 diseases, not only because they often have enhanced disease (i.e. influenza and 369 hepatitis E viruses)(40), but also due to the detrimental impact on obstetrical course and 370 neonatal outcomes. In our series, the timing of delivery for one in four women was 371 influenced by the impact of a Covid-19 pneumonia on maternal lung function; in one 372 case, this necessitated preterm delivery at 33 weeks. Covid-19 disease in the mother 373can pose a maternal-fetal dilemma, because an intervention that would benefit her (i.e.374 delivery to improve maternal lung function) might result in morbidity or mortality to the 375 neonate if delivered prematurely.

In the 383 hospital, limitations on the number of people providing labor support, development of 384 new practices for universal screening before/upon admission, new construction of negative pressure rooms and frequent care coordination between obstetrics and 386 intensive care unit teams. All of these changes resulted in increases in time, supplies 387 and staffing that created challenges to delivery of the usual standard of maternity care. 388 Further, the impact of quarantine on women's lives, stress, mental health, bonding, 389 breastfeeding and child development are critically important outcomes not captured in 390 our case series. 391 392", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "S, Shamshirsaz AA, Aleyasin A, Seferovic MD, Kazemi Aski S, Arian 536 SE, et al.

Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals are 409 almost universally excluded from Covid-19 clinical treatment trials, including the World 410 Health Organization sponsored SOLIDARITY trial (ISRCTN83971151) (47). Currently, 411 pregnant women can access both remdesivir through compassionate use and 412 convalescent plasma (NCT04338360) through an expanded access clinical trial if they 413 have confirmed severe Covid-19 (46, 48). In general, trials that allow inclusion of 414 pregnant and breastfeeding women focus on outpatient treatment trials (NCT04354428, 415 NCT043558068) or post-exposure prophylaxis trials (NCT04308668, NCT04328961), 416 with the exception of a convalescent plasma trial for patients hospitalized for Covid-19 417 (NCT04348656). It is imperative to enroll pregnant women in clinical trials testing Covid-418 19 therapeutics to enable development of evidence-based treatment guidelines. 419 The study's main strength is the inclusion of multiple health systems across Washington 422 State representing counties with the highest burden of Covid-19 and approximately 40% 423 of annual deliveries in the state. We also included both symptomatic and asymptomatic 424 cases, as well as infections from all trimesters, allowing us to better describe the full 425 range of infection in pregnancy. Lastly, all data were initially abstracted and/or reviewed 426 for accuracy by clinical obstetric providers. An important study limitation is that some 427 cases could have been missed despite the use of multiple methods of case detection at 428 most sites. It is also likely that our case series underestimates the prevalence of 429 asymptomatic cases, as testing resources were primarily directed towards symptomatic 430 cases during this study period. This would bias our study towards inclusion of patients 431 with worse clinical outcomes. Finally, other studies appear to have found more severe 432 respiratory complications when infection occurred during the peripartum period, which 433 was not well captured in our study as delivery outcomes were only available in eight 434 In this population-based case series from Washington State, 15% of pregnant patients 438 with Covid-19 were hospitalized with severe disease. Nearly all women were overweight 439 or obese prior to pregnancy and had other important co-morbidities, such as asthma 440 and hypertension. Our data suggests that pregnant women who have common health 441 conditions like obesity and asthma, may be at a greater risk for severe Covid-19 442 disease and medically-indicated preterm delivery to improve lung function. Larger 443 population-based studies are needed to determine whether pregnant individuals are at 444 higher risk for severe Covid-19 illness compared to non-pregnant adult women, and to 445 what extent obesity and other co-morbidities may enhance risk (51). Taken together, 446 pregnant women should be considered a high risk population for severe Covid-19 447 disease, particularly for women in the second and third trimesters that began pregnancy 448 Haddad BJS, Jacobsson B, Chabra S, Modzelewska D, Olson EM, Bernier R, et al.
