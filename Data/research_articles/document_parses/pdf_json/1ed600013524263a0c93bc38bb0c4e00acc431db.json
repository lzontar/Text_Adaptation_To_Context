Nine randomly chosen samples out of 30 apparently negative samples were amplified using PCR with primers Hfor and Hrev to yield a typical 630 bp fragment. Then, six randomly chosen samples out of nine were amplified using PCR with primers Pbs and Pbas to yield a typical 427 bp fragment. Sequencing, BLAST analysis and assembly of the two fragments (630 bp and 427 bp) to produce 912 bp fragments, in the six samples, revealed two serotypes CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The obtained strains were submitted to GenBank and given accession numbers MK642272, MK642273, MK642274, MK642275, MK642276, and MK642277. Phylogenetic analysis of the Egyptian strains serotype 2b illustrated that they were closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers KP715709, KP715694, KP715701, and KP715700); while Egyptian strains serotype 2c was closely related to Thailand strains (accession numbers MH711894 and MH711902), Taiwanese strain (KU244254), Chinese strain (MF467242), and Vietnamese strain (accession number LC216910).",

CPV2 is classified within the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Protoparvovirus, and species carnivore protoparvovirus 1 [2] . The viral genome is a single-stranded, linear, negative-sense DNA comprising about 5200 nucleotides. The genome encodes four proteins; two non-structural proteins called NS1 (involved in viral replication) and NS2 (has a role in capsid assembly) and two structural proteins termed VP1 (involved in cell infection) and VP2 (forms the viral capsid and is the main protective antigen) [3] .",

In 2005, a Penta Dog inactivated cell culture vaccine containing CPV was prepared [8] . In addition, the effect of different adjuvants on the inactivated canine parvo vaccine was investigated [9] . Egg yolk (IgY) was prepared against CPV conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate and horseradish peroxidase. The CPV was adapted among other canine viruses on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells without serum and oral vaccination of puppies was formulated with canine core vaccine including parvovirus [10, 11] . Isolation of CPV2 on Vero cells, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequence analysis confirmed the presence of genotype CPV2b in 2012. While in 2014, clustering of the virus within genotypes 2b and 2c was observed [12, 13] . Antibodies detected against CPV in domestic dogs, using serodiagnosis, demonstrated high susceptibility of 4-month-old puppies in 2016. In 2018, genotypes 2a and 2b were identified using genetic characterization with special reference to multiple mutations in genotype 2b [14, 15] . Genotype 2b is still circulating in Egypt with successful isolation of virus on Vero cells [16] .",

The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method [20] . The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.03463035 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method [21] and are in the units of the number of base differences per site. The rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 1). This analysis involved 30 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1 st + 2 nd + 3 rd + non-coding. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 912 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [22] .",

Most Egyptian studies have a limited number of samples, which are not enough to establish realistic epidemiological data. The serotypes and mutations identified throughout this study might provide evidence for the inadequate protection of some commonly used and produced vaccines in Egypt. The cross-protection between different serotypes in vaccination and its extent is still a debatable issue worldwide and very difficult to evaluate; as some claim that CPV-2 can protect against new antigenic types including latest type (CPV-2c), some claim that CPV-2b, during challenging, can protect against virulent field strain CPV-2c, and others that current CPV vaccines failed to protect against field strains. Vaccines should include the prevailing antigenic types of a field virus to provide complete protection. Caution should be given during vaccine development to avoid mismatch between the vaccinal strain (modified live vaccine) and infecting strain that can lead to increase the risk of an outbreak.
