            "text": "Reliable serological tests are required to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens and to characterise immunity to the disease in order to address key knowledge gaps in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays to detect IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated the performance of the assays using 128 plasmas obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic (negative controls) and 115 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 8 were asymptomatic, 58 had mild symptoms and 49 were hospitalized. Pre-existing IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S2 proteins were detected in negative controls suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. The best performing antibody isotype/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 94.94% at \u226514 days since the onset of symptoms and 96.08% at \u226521 days since the onset of symptoms, with AUC of 0.992 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple antibody markers as assessed by qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth and versatility to accurately detect low-level antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens in a population. Our assays will allow gaining insights into antibody correlates of immunity required for vaccine development to combat pandemics like the COVID-19.",

            "text": "In a globalized world where emerging infectious diseases of broad distribution can put at stake the health and economy of millions of people, there is a need for versatile and reliable serological tools that can be readily applicable (i) to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against any new pathogen and, more importantly, (ii) to characterise immunity to the disease at the individual and community levels. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, one of the main priorities since the beginning of the epidemics in China by the end of 2019 (1) was to ascertain the percentage of the population that had been exposed to the virus, considering that a considerable number of people could have been asymptomatic (2) (3) . The lack of sensitive and specific serological tests early in the COVID- 19 pandemic delayed the precise estimation of the burden of infection for the rational implementation of public health measures to control viral spread (4) . Furthermore, immunological assays that can measure a high breadth of antibody types and specificities are needed to dissect which are the naturally acquired protective responses and identify correlates of immunity (5) . Additionally, when a vaccine becomes available, such assays would be valuable to evaluate immunogenicity of candidate vaccines and monitor duration of immunity at the population level (6) .",

The performance characteristics of the commercial kits available in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic were questionable (10) , while external evaluations validating their reliability and accuracy were not published. A number of in-house ELISA assays have also been developed in hospital and research laboratories (11) , but they have the limitations that (i) a relatively large amount of sample is required, (ii) the large surface area of the individual microplate wells and the hydrophobic binding of capture antibody can lead to non-specific binding and increased background, and (iii) most ELISAs rely upon enzyme-mediated amplification of signal in order to achieve reasonable sensitivity (12).",

            "text": "An alternative technique that offers the benefits of ELISA but also a larger dynamic range of antibody quantification and higher sensitivity (12) (13) is based on the xMAP Luminex\u00ae platform (www.luminexcorp.com/bibliography). Secondary antibodies are labelled with fluorescent phycoerythrin (PE) directly or with biotin that mediates binding to streptavidin-Rphycoerythrin (SAPE), which does not depend on an additional reaction. The technique has the added value of higher throughput (up to 384-well plate format), increased flexibility, and lower cost with the same workflow as ELISA, particularly if using magnetic MagPlex\u00ae microspheres. Paramagnetic beads allow for automation of workflow and better reproducibility compared to the previous generation of MicroPlex\u00ae microspheres. Since the beads have the capture antigen immobilized on their much smaller surface area compared to a 96-well microplate well, reduced sample volumes are required and non-specific binding is diminished (14) . Furthermore, a chief advantage over ELISA is the multiplex nature of the assay that allows measuring antibodies to different antigens simultaneously. This increases the probabilities to detect a positive antibody response due to the heterogeneity of the human response and therefore it has a higher sensitivity relevant for identifying seropositive individuals. The Luminex technology, capable of measuring simultaneously antibodies against 50 (MAGPIX\u00ae), 80 (Luminex 100/200\u00ae) and up to 500 different antigens (FlexMap3D\u00ae), makes it an invaluable tool for antigen and epitope screening. Finally, its versatility to set up adapted antigen panels makes Luminex an excellent platform to ensure better preparedness for faster response to future emerging diseases and pandemics.",

The cost of the xMAP assay can be less than one-fifth of the least expensive commercial ELISA and less than one-sixteenth of the most expensive commercial kit. Cost is reduced because there is less protein used due to the smaller surface area and less amounts of other materials and reagents. We reduced the dilutions of plasma and titrated the secondary antibody to use the minimal amounts of samples and reagents, without compromising sensitivity. The economy of scale will improve further when the assays are adapted to high throughput FlexMap3D 384-well plate format but they are also easily adaptable to the bench top MagPix 96-well format that is more affordable and easy to maintain even in remote laboratory settings.",

            "text": "Interestingly, positive antibody responses to M, S1, S2 and N antigen constructs were detected in samples collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. The presence of such antibodies has been interpreted as cross-reactivity with antigens of coronaviruses causing the common cold (10)(44) (45) . Indeed, higher sequence homology at the protein level between SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses has been reported for N (particularly N-terminal and central regions), M and S2 (10)(46) (47) . Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been recently reported and also attributed to cross-reactivity to human coronaviruses previously encountered (48) (49) . The multiplex nature of the assay will allow to test this hypothesis in the future with the addition of antigens to related coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43 in the same assay panel, by comparing the patterns of antibody reactivity, in order to address the significance of this in immunity to Here, antibody responses to M were very marginal and did not contribute to higher assay sensitivity and this could partly be because the purity of the protein was not high. However, this antigen may be valuable in studies establishing the antibody correlates of protection since at present the targets of immunity have not been elucidated. It is possible that, in addition to neutralizing antibodies directed to the RBD region of S, antibodies of other specificities with non-neutralizing functions, for example Fc-mediated opsonisation and phagocytosis, could be relevant in protection. In fact, T cell responses to epitopes located on M have been detected at high frequencies (48) , and it is possible that antibodies to this or other less immunogenic antigens may also have a role in protection in some individuals. In our study, the addition of S1 from a commercial supplier did not have any added value but for future versions of the assay we will test S1 from different sources, as this subunit is expected to not cross-react with other beta-coronaviruses and be specific for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (11) (46) . The assays performances were excellent but further testing needs to be performed with longer periods of time since onset of symptoms, although we do expect to maintain high specificity and sensitivity albeit antibody signatures would be different and based on IgG only. Future studies will include additional positive samples of asymptomatic individuals, who probably have lower antibody levels than mild or severe cases and are rarely included in the validation of commercial kits. In addition, it will be interesting to include negative controls reacting with other coronaviruses or other infections (e.g. malaria) and pathologies known to induce polyclonal responses or rheumatoid factor, which may increase background responses.",

Considering their high sensitivity, these qSAT assays would be suited to identify individuals with levels of antibodies below the lower limit of detection of RDT or the lower limit of quantification of ELISA, such as asymptomatic children or immunosuppressed individuals, or long-term decaying antibodies (50) . In addition this approach would be particularly suited to identify hyper immune donors with very high levels of antibodies and the largest antigenic breadth for immunotherapy. The assays are highly versatile, being easily adaptable to quantify other antibody IgG and IgA subclasses and avidity with the use of chaotropic agents, and even functional activity like binding inhibition to the virus receptor ACE2. The multiplex capabilities make them also ideal for sizeable peptide screenings to accelerate epitope mapping and selection for identifying fine-specificity of immune correlates of protection for vaccine development, and would also be applicable in vaccine evaluation when the first candidates reach larger-scale phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.",

The multiplex antigen panel was completed with commercial S1 (GenScript Biotech, Netherlands) and S2 (Sino Biologicals, Germany) proteins, and in-house produced nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) recombinant proteins. Escherichia coli codon optimized versions of full-length N and M antigens were cloned at ISGlobal into a pET22b expression vector, fusing an in-frame C-terminal 6xHis-tag. Recombinant N and M proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 by pET22b-N and pET22b-M transformation and induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when OD 600 reached 0.6-0.8, followed by 5 h incubation at 37\u00baC or 25\u00baC, respectively. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in binding buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.2 mg/mL Lysozyme, 20 \u00b5g/mL DNAse, 1 mM PMSF and 1 mM MgCl 2 , and lysed by sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm and proteins purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni 2+ column (1 mL GE Healthcare HisTrap HP) and imidazole gradient elution in an AKTA Start protein purification system. M and N proteins were concentrated and buffer changed to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using Microcon-10 KDa centrifugal filter units (Millipore). For N-terminal (residues from 43 to 180) and C-terminal fragments (residues from 250 to 360) of N, two constructs were designed at CRG depending on secondary structure predictions. The encoding sequences were synthesized and inserted into a plasmid pETM14 with the N-terminal 6xHis-tag under the control of a T7 promoter, and recombinant plasmids transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3 competent cells. Briefly, E. coli containing the plasmid was grown and the protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG 0.2 mM for 16 h at 18\u00b0C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer A (Tris 20 mM, 250mM NaCl, 10mM Imidazole) supplemented with 0.5% Triton-X100 Substitute (Sigma) and complete mini EDTA-free protease (Roche), sonicated, and centrifuged (30 min, 4\u00b0C, 30000 g). The N-terminal, and the C-terminal recombinant proteins containing a N-terminal 6xHis-tag were purified from the resulting supernatant using Hitrap Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer instructions. After washing with Buffer A, the antigen was eluted using linear gradient with buffer B (Buffer A supplemented with 500 mM Imidazol). The fractions of interest were dialyzed against PBS 1x and concentrated by Vivaspin 5 KD (Millipore, France). The antigens produced were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce) and their purity controlled by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate -PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).",

To activate the beads for cross-linking to proteins, 10 \u00b5l of 50 mg/mL sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 24525) and 50 \u00b5L of 50 mg/mL 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimidehydrochloride (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22981) were simultaneously added to the reaction tubes, mixed and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 20 min in a rotatory shaker and protected from light. Next, beads were washed twice with 62.5 \u00b5l 50 mM morpholineethane sulfonic acid (MES) (Sigma, M1317) pH 5.0, in a 10,000 beads/ \u00b5l concentration. After beads activation, antigen were added to the reaction tubes at three different concentrations (10, 30 and 50 \u00b5g/mL) and left at 4\u00baC overnight (ON) on a rotatory shaker protected from light. On the following day, coupled-beads were brought to RT for 20 min in agitation, and blocked by incubating them with 62.5 \u00b5l PBS (Sigma) + 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Biowest) + 0.05% sodium azide (Sigma, S8032) (PBS-BN) in agitation during 30 min at RT and protected from light. Beads were washed twice with PBS-BN using the magnetic separator. To determine the percentage recovery of beads after the coupling procedure, coupled beads were resuspended in 62.5 \u00b5L PBS-BN and counted on a Guava PCA desktop cytometer (Guava Technologies, Automated cell counter, PC550IG-C4C/0746-2747). In all washing and resuspension steps, beads were softly vortexed and sonicated for 30 sec. Antigen-coupled beads were validated by incubating them with serial dilutions of anti-histidine-Biotin antibody for antigens with a histidine-tag (Abcam, ab27025). To choose an appropriate coupling concentration, IgG and IgM levels were measured in 11 serial dilutions 3-fold of a pool of 20 positive samples and titration curves compared for each protein. Coupled beads were stored multiplexed at 2000 beads/\u00b5L PBS-BN at 4\u00b0C and protected from light until use.",

Plates were washed three times, and 100 \u00b5L of SAPE (Sigma, 42250) diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BN were added and incubated during 30 min at 600 rpm, RT and protected from light.

Plates were washed three times, beads resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of PBS-BN, and data acquired using a Luminex\u00ae 100/200 analyzer with 70 \u00b5l of acquisition volume per well, DD gat 5000-25000 settings, and high PMT option. Plates could also be kept ON at 4\u00baC, protected from light, and read the next day. At least 50 beads were acquired per antigen and sample. Crude median fluorescent intensities (MFI) were exported using the xPONENT software. Seropositivity threshold (cutoff) for optimization tests was calculated as 10 to the mean plus 3 standard deviations of log 10 -transformed MFIs of the negative controls for each antibody isotype and antigen. Performance of the SARS-Cov-2 qSAT assays The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, their corresponding area under the curve (AUC), and the specificity and sensitivity of the IgM, IgA and IgG assays, were established testing all 115 positive samples from participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of symptoms information and at different periods since the onset of symptoms (7, 14, 21 and 28), and 128 negative samples. For IgM, IgA and IgG assays the multiplex panel including RBD, S, S1, S2, M and N antigen constructs was used, following the same procedures as indicated above and after selecting the optimal assay conditions. Data analysis ROC curves and AUC, sensitivities and specificities were calculated using the predicted values estimated by supervised machine learning Random Forest (RF) algorithm models with all pre-pandemic negative controls and COVID-19 positive controls. IgM, IgA and IgG MFIs to the different antigens or their combinations were the predictors, and the outcome was SARS-CoV-2 positivity or negativity. Antibody/antigen variables that did not discriminate between positive samples from negative controls were excluded from the analysis. Then the antibody/antigen variables were further down-selected using an RF algorithm including all negative and positive controls (N=243) or all negative controls plus positive controls corresponding to each different period since onset of symptoms: \u22657 days (N=221), \u226514 days (N=207), \u226521 days (N=179), \u226528 days (N=155). The importance of the variables was ranked according to the Mean Decrease Accuracy and the Mean Decrease Gini. Next, different RFs were built exploring all possible variable combinations at the different periods based on the selected variables per period: all samples (top 12 markers), \u22657 days (top 12 markers), \u226514",
