Interestingly, these 4 clusters coincided with disease progression in 91 clinical observation (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1A ). We named these four clusters as: 1) Stage 1 92 (S1), representing the early onset; 2) Stage 2 (S2), representing the clinically most 93 severe stage; 3) Stage 3 (S3), representing improving stage; and 4) Stage R, 94 representing the recovering or convalescent stage. Notably, all three patients in S2 95 (PtQ5, PtJ7, PtL9, PtW9) were at the most severe disease state, demonstrated by the 96 highest C-reactive protein in plasma, the lowest lymphocyte counts, and the worst 97 chest radiography (Fig. S1A ). Four samples from the healthy donor formed a distinct 98 cluster, which was named as cluster H. Of note, cluster R is adjacent to cluster H, 99 suggesting the transcriptomes in the recovery stage is approaching the healthy state. 100 This result demonstrates that the gene expression profiles have distinct patterns along 101 with disease progression. These patterns were reproducible in different COVID-9 102 patients, at least for non-ICU patients.",

Our analysis was verified by clinical 111 tests of T lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in these patients (Fig. S1A) . To identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different disease stages, we 116 first performed paired comparison between S1 and R, S2 and R, S3 and R for each 117 person (Fig. 1C) . We also combined all samples from different patients at the same 118 disease stage for group comparison (Fig. 1D ). Compared to the convalescent state, the 119 number of DEGs was 2661, 4811, and 834 in S1, S2, and S3 respectively, 120 representing 8.7%, 15.8%, and 2.7% genes in the transcriptomes (Fig. 1D ). In contrast, 121 there were few changes in the number of DEGs before and after vaccination in a 122 healthy person. We found that there were many identical DEGs among different 123 COVID-19 patients, especially when these samples belonged to the same disease 124 stage. The 4 patients shared 155, 341 and 23 DEGs at S1, S2 and S3 respectively (Fig. 125 S1E-F). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in common changes in gene 126 expression profile in different regular COVID-19 patients. Since the samples in R 127 may not fully represent the healthy state, we also performed grouped comparison 128 between S1 and H, S2 and H, S3 and H, R and H (Fig. S1G) . Indeed, there were more 129 DEGs when compared with gene expression in a healthy state. An average of 19.3%, 130 17.1%, 11.0%, and 3.9% genes in the transcriptome have undergone significant 131 expression changes in S1, S2, S3, and R, respectively. 132 All rights reserved.

To identify genes closely related to disease progression, we performed a time series 134 analysis for all DEGs. The healthy samples were assumed to be a stage representing 135 pre-infection to capture the time-dependent changes. All DEGs could be divided into 136 6 clusters based on their expression patterns (Fig. 1E ). The pattern of gene expression 137 in each cluster somewhat appeared to resemble an alphabet, so we named each cluster 138 as \"n\", \"A\", \"M\", \"U\", \"V\", and \"W\". Each cluster contains 1659, 1668, 1717, 1780, 139 1703, and 1599 genes respectively (Fig. 1F ). To investigate the biological functions 140 associated with each cluster, we performed gene ontology analysis. The top 5 biology 141 process (BP) terms of each cluster were listed (Fig. 1G) . Cluster \"n\", \"A\", and \"M\" 142 contained 1043\uff0c609, and 339 BP terms respectively (q-value <0.05). Genes in cluster 143 \"U\", \"V\" and \"W\" showed few discernible biological themes; each contained only 23, 144 11, and 0 BP terms (Fig. 1G, Fig. S1H ). To verify the contribution of the genes in 145 cluster \"n\", \"A\" and \"M\" to disease progression, we took the top 2000 genes with the 146 largest contribution to PC1 and PC2 (termed gene set PC1 and PC2 hereafter) and 147 compared with genes in the cluster \"n\", \"A\" and \"M\", respectively (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1I ).",

In severe patients with influenza virus infection, excessively 430 activated neutrophils form excessive NETs (35). In Ebola virus disease fatalities, 431 excessive NET-related proteins (MPO, CTSG) expressed by neutrophils are closely 432 related to systemic tissue damage caused by Ebola virus infection (36). In the acute 433 phase of dengue virus infection, patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (a more 434 severe disease state) have higher levels of NET-related proteins (MPO-DNA 435 complexes) (37). Besides, the number of neutrophils in SARS and COVID-19 severe 436 patients is significantly increased (1, 38-40). Additionally, CXCL8 is secreted 437 primarily by neutrophils. CXCL8 serves as a chemotactic factor by guiding the 438 neutrophils to the site of infection to cause lung damage. 439 440 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

The West Nile virus (WNV) NS1 protein and Kunjin virus NS2A 448 protein inhibited the activation of IRF7 and the transcription of IFNB, respectively 449 (42).

The expression of SERPINE1 (PAI1) and its 494 family members are significantly increased during early onset. PAI1 stimulates 495 thrombus propagation by inhibiting uPA (PLAU) mediated fibrinolysis. Moreover, 496 hypoxia upregulates expression of HIF1A and HIF2A which further suppress uPA 497 (PLAU) activity, leading to secondary hyperfibrinolysis condition. Previous study 498 suggested that dysregulation of the urokinase pathway during SARS-coronavirus 499 infection contributes to more severe lung pathology (56). Our study suggested that 500 SERPINE1 and PLAU may be key targets involved in the early pathological process 501 of DIC. There may be other causes of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 patients. 502 For example, LDN releases excess neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) that cause 503 platelets to accumulate at the site of inflammation and promote thrombosis (57).
