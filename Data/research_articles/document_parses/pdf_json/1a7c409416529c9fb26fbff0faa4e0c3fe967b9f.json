Here, we studied the whole-blood transcriptomic host response to SARS-CoV-2 and compared it with other viral infections to understand similarities and differences in host response. Using RNAseq we profiled peripheral blood from 24 healthy controls and 62 prospectively enrolled patients with community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection by SARS-Cov-2 within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. We also compiled and curated 23 independent studies that profiled 1,855 blood samples from patients with one of six viruses (influenza, RSV, HRV, ebola, Dengue, and SARS-CoV-1). We show gene expression changes in peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 versus healthy controls are highly correlated with changes in response to other viral infections (r=0.74, p<0.001). However, two genes, ACO1 and ATL3, show significantly opposite changes between conditions. Pathway analysis in patients with COVID-19 or other viral infections versus healthy controls identified similar pathways including neutrophil activation, innate immune response, immune response to viral infection, and cytokine production for over-expressed genes. Conversely, for under-expressed genes, pathways indicated repression of lymphocyte differentiation and T cell activation. When comparing transcriptome profiles of patients with COVID-19 directly with those with other viral infections, we found 114 and 302 genes were over-or under-expressed, respectively, during COVID-19. Pathways analysis did not identify any significant pathways in these genes, suggesting novel responses to further study. Statistical deconvolution using immunoStates found that M1 macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD14+ monocytes, CD4+ T cells, and total B cells showed change consistently in the same direction across all viral infections including COVID-19. Those that increased in COVID-19 but decreased in non-COVID-19 viral infections were CD56 bright NK cells, M2 macrophages, and total NK cells.

Prior reports suggest that both genes may be involved in viral replication and immune evasion. ACO1 is an iron-sulfur protein that regulates ferritin and transferrin. When cellular iron levels are low, the protein binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs), which represses translation of ferritin (a protein that stores iron), and simultaneously stabilizes the normally rapidly degraded transferrin receptor mRNA allowing for translation of the receptor and more cellular uptake of iron, which is required for proliferation 45 . High levels of ferritin are also indicative of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and have been observed in COVID-19 patients 22,46-48 . ATL3 is a member of the integral membrane GTPases. Proper formation of ER tubules is affected by mutations in this gene. Viruses are known to target host organelles to enter a host cell and avoid destruction 49 .

While we identified that a large proportion of the host response is similar to that of other infections, we also identified key differences in individual genes, pathways, and cellularity that are suggestive of the clinical differences observed in COVID-19. Of particular interest are the potential roles of ACO1 and ATL3 in describing the differential host response in COVID-19 complemented by the 416 genes that may identify novel biology and further the understanding of ACO1 and ATL3, but our findings will need to be replicated in further clinical studies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": ".

Figure 2 are colored distinguishably in 9 quadrats. Concordant host response between COVID-19 and other viral infections is reflected by 223 commonly positively and 220 negatively regulated genes in both. Discordant response is only seen in ACO1 whose expression is positively regulated in COVID-19 but negatively regulated in non-COVID, and in ATL3 whose expression is negatively regulated in COVID-19 but positively regulated in non-COVID-19. (b) The head-to-head comparison between COVID-19 and other viral infections was made possible by using co-normalized data by COCONUT. Significance score [defined as -log10(FDR)] vs mean difference of co-normalized log2-transformed expression data between COVID-19 patients (n = 62) vs other viral infections (n = 652). The chosen cutoff of ES \u2265 1 or \u2264 -1 with FDR \u2264 0.05% yields 416 COVID-19 specific signature, including 114 positively regulated genes and 302 negatively regulated genes. (c) To illustrate the overlap of (a) and (b), the 416 COVID-19 specific signature genes from head-to-head comparison in (b) are shown in the same scatter plot in (a).
