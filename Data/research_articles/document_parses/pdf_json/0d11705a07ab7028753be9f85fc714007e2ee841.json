To this end, the impact of different weather conditions on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is still inconclusive. One study calculated the daily effective All rights reserved.

In this study, we assess the transmission of COVID-19 under different weather conditions by investigating the propagation of infectious respiratory droplets. A comprehensive mathematical model is established to explore their evaporation, heat transfer and kinematics under different temperature, humidity and ventilation conditions. The transmitting pathway of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets is divided into short-range droplet contacts and long-range aerosol exposure. We show that the effect of weather conditions is not monotonic: low temperature and high humidity facilitate droplet contact transmission, while high temperature and low humidity promote the formation of aerosol particles and accumulation of particles with a diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (PM2.5). Our model suggests that the 6 ft of social distance recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be insufficient in certain environmental conditions, as the droplet spreading distance can be as long as 6 m (19.7 ft) in cold and humid weather. The results of this study suggest that the current pandemic may not ebb in the summer of the northern hemisphere without proper intervention, as there is an increasing chance of aerosol transmission. We also emphasize that the meticulous design of building ventilation systems is critical in containing both the droplet contact infections and aerosol exposures.",

(6) (7) (8) (9) The basic reproduction number R0, which measures the average secondary infections caused by one infectious case, for COVID-19 has a mean value of 3.28 and may rise to as high as 6.32 without proper public health interventions,(10-12) a sobering value compared to R0 = 1.4-1.7 for influenza and R0 = 1-3 for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

            "text": "Among known transmitting pathways of SARS-CoV-2, transmission via respiratory droplets is believed to be a primary mode, based on previous studies on SARS (15) and influenza (16) . As many as 40,000 respiratory droplets can be generated by sneezing, coughing and even normal talking, with initial speeds ranging from a few meters per second up to more than a hundred meters per second. (17) (18) (19) These respiratory droplets are expelled from our upper respiratory tracts (URTs) and serve as potential pathogen carriers. (20) Extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the formation, (21, 22) spreading, (18) (19) (20) 23) and infectivity (24, 25) of respiratory droplets. Models to predict the infection probability under different circumstances have been developed as well. (26) (27) (28) These past studies suggest that both aerodynamics and the heat and mass exchange process with the environment can determine the mode and the effectiveness of virus propagation during the travel of respiratory droplets. While large droplets usually settle onto a surface within a limited distance due to gravity, smaller droplets evaporate rapidly to form aerosol particles that are able to carry the virus and float in air for hours. (28, 29) Under certain weather conditions, how far can the virus carriers travel on average? What fraction of droplets will turn into aerosol particles? What role do the HVAC and air conditioning systems play in virus propagation? Quantitative answers to these practical questions can provide urgently needed guidance to both policy makers and the general public, e.g. on social distancing rules.",

We expanded the modeling framework developed by Wells,(29) Kukkonen et al (35) and Xie et al(23) by discussing Brownian motion, considering residual salt and incorporating kinematic analysis of aerosol particles. As shown in Figure 1 , the transmission of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets is categorized into two modes: droplet contact and exposure to aerosol particles. We first focus on the effect of temperature and relative humidity on these two modes of disease transmission. Our results suggest that high temperature and low humidity promote the formation of aerosol particles, while low temperature and high humidity promote droplet contact transmission. Although social distancing has been proven effective in slowing down COVID-19 transmission, the 6 feet of physical distance recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) turns out to be insufficient in eliminating all possible droplet contacts. In some extremely cool and humid weather conditions, the droplet spreading distance may reach as far as 6 m (19.7 feet). We suggest that the current pandemic may not ebb over the summer without continuous and proper public health intervention, because (1) in hot and dry weather, respiratory droplets more easily evaporate into aerosol particles capable of long-range transmission; (2) infectious PM2.5 that can infiltrate deeply into our lung has a longer suspension time in hot and dry weather; (3) many public spaces implement air-conditioning systems that can still operate at temperature and humidity setpoints that favor droplet transport. Our results also demonstrate that ventilation has both favorable and adverse consequences. On one hand, ventilation to outdoor air can effectively dilute the accumulation of infectious aerosol particles; on the other hand, improper design of ventilation systems may void the effort of social distancing by expanding the traveling All rights reserved.

Generally, the aerosol particles in this study range from 1 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm and share similar dynamic behaviors and impact on human respiratory systems. Likewise, such viruscarrying aerosol particles can lead to airborne transmission of COVID-19 once being inhaled (37, 38) . Because of their long suspension time in air, they have the potential of achieving long-range infection(32) Generally wearing a face mask can effectively lower the chance of transmission via aerosol particles. 2) large droplets that transmit the disease by contact. The infection range of these droplets is limited to a relatively short distance, because they are more sensitive to gravity and can settle on a surface before drying. If these droplets happen to land on the upper body of another person, viruses can easily enter their URTs by face-touching and eye-rubbing. This type of virus transmission can be prevented by practicing social distancing. We define a critical distance Lmax as the maximum horizontal distance that all respiratory droplets can travel before they either shrink to suspending aerosol particles or descend to the level of another person's hands (H/2 from the ground, where H is the person's height). Beyond Lmax, an individual will be completely clear of falling droplets (category 2), but can still be exposed to long-range aerosol particles (category 1), as shown in Figure 1 .",

We find that the Brownian motion becomes significant only for droplets with diameters smaller than 0.5 \u03bcm. The expected fluctuations of a 1 \u03bcm particle caused by Brownian motion is limited to 0.03 m in the life of a droplet. Therefore, we eventually neglected the Brownian force in formulating the kinematic equation. After complete evaporation of the droplets, the analysis on the residue aerosol particle was continued by solving its transport and deposition using kinematic equations.

The initial velocity v0 of droplets was taken as 4.1 m/s for speaking. (39) We also calculated the sneezing mode (v0=100 m/s) and the results are shown in the Supporting Information. For the subsequent sections, we choose to focus on speaking mode to mimic a real social distancing situation where people keep a reasonable physical distance and only sneeze/cough into a tissue or their elbow. The probability distribution of initial droplet diameter d0 is from a previous experimental work by Duguid.(40) , listed in the Supporting Information. The initial temperature T0 of exhaled droplets was set to be 33 \u2103. (41) For the environment, we used an average Vair = 0.3 m/s in horizontal direction as the wind speed for an indoor environment, (42) and varied the wind speed from 0-3 m/s when analyzing the effect of ventilation and wind. In order to explore the effects of weather conditions, environmental temperature T \u221e and relative humidity RH were varied from 0-42 \u2103 and 0-0.92, respectively. Figure S5 (a) shows that the droplet diameter shrinks over time and that droplets smaller than 20 \u03bcm evaporate within 1 s. Figure S5 (b) demonstrates that all the droplets cool to the wet bulb temperature Twb in less than 1 second due to the latent heat required by evaporation. The trajectory of a droplet is analyzed in terms of the vertical distance Lz (Figure 2 (a)) and horizontal distance Lx (Figure 2 (b)) that the droplet can travel before it either completely dries or descends to the level of another person's hand (H/2). Here we set H to be the average height of American adults (1.75 m). Figure 2 (a) shows that droplets with diameter smaller than 73.5 \u03bcm can completely dehydrate into aerosol particles and therefore only descend a vertical distance less than H/2. Droplets larger than 73.5 \u03bcm fall below the level of hands (H/2). They are less likely to transmit the disease and we do not consider them dangerous. Therefore, we used a plain cut-off of Lz = H/2 for all droplets falling below that. A critical droplet diameter dc can be defined by identifying the initial diameter below which droplets can fully evaporate before descending to the hands. Figure 2 (b) reveals that the maximum of Lx occurs at d0 = dc as well. As shown in Figure   2 (c), for d<dc, Lx increases with respect to d0 because a larger droplet takes longer time to fully All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Figure 3 . For droplet contact transmission, we plotted Lmax as defined previously, under different temperature and humidity conditions ( Figure 3a ). It is shown that droplets can travel a longer distance in humid but cool environments, and therefore such environments require a longer social distance to completely eliminate droplet contact. In extremely cold and humid scenarios it can require as far as 6 m. On the other hand, respiratory droplets in hot and dry environments experience a faster mass loss as evaporation has been dramatically intensified. As those droplets sharply decrease in size, the horizontal traveling distance is reduced due to the growing damping effect of air. As a result, a less strict social distancing rule may potentially be applied on a really dry summer day, although at this point we have not examined the transmission via aerosol particles. We highlight that in most regions of Figure 3 (a), Lmax exceeds 1.8 m, i.e., the 6 feet of physical distance recommended by CDC. Therefore, current social distancing guidelines All rights reserved.

Here we assumed a constant concentration of the virus in the droplets and the number of viruses is consequently proportional to the initial mass of respiratory droplets.(43) Interestingly, we find that this relaxed social distancing standard does not show an apparent dependence on the weather conditions (see Supporting Information). Therefore, 1.4 m may serve as a relaxed weatherindependent criterion that can eliminate the majority of viruses from directly landing on another person. Caution is still required as this relaxed rule does not block transmission via aerosol particles and is evaluated for speaking mode with an air velocity of 0.3 m/s. The distance increases for an increased air velocity, the effect of which is discussed in a later section.",

On the contrary to the trend observed for Lmax, Figure 3 (b) predicts an increasing aerosolization rate \u03c6a for hot and dry environments. \u03c6a is defined as the percentage of respiratory droplets that completely dehydrate before settling below the level of hands (H/2), and characterizes the amount of infectious aerosol particles that can be produced by speaking. The terminal sizes of these aerosol particles are in the range of 1 \u03bcm to 15 \u03bcm based on our model (Figure 3c and Figure S8 ). Such small particles can potentially suspend in air for hours (28, 37) before settling ( Figure S8 ) and tend to accumulate in public areas such as schools, offices, hotels, and hospitals. In particular, the increasing number of superspreading events that occurred at indoor environments evidenced the possibility of COVID-19 transmitting efficiently via aerosol particles. Therefore, the long-range infection induced by aerosol particles deserves more attention in the coming summer, especially in dry weather, since the resistivity of SARS-CoV-2 in these warm and dry environment is still not fully understood.(30,",

Figure   3 (d) presents the values of md in different environmental conditions. There is slightly more PM2.5 suspended in air in a hot and dry environment than in a cold and humid environment. This is mainly due to the increased suspension time in hot and dry environments as a result of the corresponding thermophysical properties of the air. By combining Figure 3(b) and (d) , the hot and dry weather not only increases the percentage of respiratory droplets turning into aerosols, but also facilitates the accumulation of PM2.5 in an enclosed space. These facts raise a growing concern of aerosol transmission of COVID-19 in the coming summer, especially when the humidity is low. (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. To consider a worst situation, we model a scenario where the wind is always directed from an infected individual to a susceptible person. As shown in Figure 4 , while the increased ventilation slightly affects the aerosolization rate of respiratory droplets, it has a significant impact on the spreading distance of droplets. The majority of droplets are moving with the airflow after their horizontal velocity settles down to the wind speed, which usually happens in a short time due to a small . Therefore, the droplet spreading distance has been dramatically increased as the wind velocity increases, with a maximum value of 23 m in a gentle breeze (Vair = 3 m/s). In addition, the spreading of aerosol particles is greatly increased as well, since they are smaller in size and travel with the wind. In summary, ventilation has both favorable and adverse consequences. While fresh outdoor air can effectively dilute the accumulation of infectious aerosol particles, it expands transport distances of pathogen-carrying droplets and aerosol particles. This poses stringent requirements on the meticulous design of ventilation configurations in non-hospital facilities, so as to cut off the transmission of COVID-19.",

Figure S4 demonstrates the strong dependence of droplet evaporation dynamics on the initial diameter of a sneezing droplet. In Figure S4 (a), the diameter of a small droplet (d0 = 50 \u03bcm) experiences a rapid decrease. For a large droplet, the diameter firstly decreases linearly, because the evaporative flux at this point is primarily determined by the vapor pressure difference; eventually its diameter experiences a sharp decrease in that the increasing surface-to-volume ratio further intensifies the evaporation. Figure S4 (b) presents the temperature profile of a droplet during evaporation. Note that the x axis in this figure is in logarithmic scale. Apparently, the temperature of all droplets rapidly decreases to the wet bulb temperature Twb within one second, owing to the large latent heat required to evaporate. Therefore, the effect of heat transfer is not significant on the evaporation dynamics, as the droplet stays at Twb throughout the evaporation process.",

We find that the horizontal traveling of small droplets (d0 <100 \u03bcm) is strongly dependent on weather conditions; however, large droplets are inert and become insensitive to weather change. Since most pathogens exist in large respiratory droplets, the curve of distance-dependent viral load in Figure S7 is not sensitive to weather conditions. Therefore, we only demonstrate the viral load curve under normal indoor conditions (T \u221e = 23 \u2103, RH = 0.50, Vair = 0.3 m/s), and a weather-independent criterion can be used for relaxed social distancing.",

(e) Safe distance Lmax and (f) aerosolization rate \u03c6a in major US cities in summer and winter. Indoor wind speed is assumed (Vair = 0.3 m/s). Finally, we compute the geographical distribution of spreading distance Lmax and aerosolization rate \u03c6a across the United States to help evaluate the risk of infections caused by droplet contact and exposure to aerosol particles, which may provide the policymakers with a general guideline to curb the spread of this epidemic. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents the state-bystate data based on the average weather conditions of each state in August.(49) Note that the weather data we collected are a monthly average over day and night as well as rural and urban regions. Generally, the inland regions are more vulnerable to aerosolization of viruses and the east and west coast should be cautious of droplet-based infections. California, on average, exhibits a higher risk of droplet spreading but a lower risk of infection induced by aerosol particles (Figure 5(a) and 5(b)). However, within the state of California, strong variations exist as shown in Figure 5(c) and 5(d). Note that Figure 5(c) and (d) were plotted using the average temperature and relative humidity in the afternoon of August.(49) The Mediterranean climate of California, together with the abundant oceanic moisture, brings the cool and moist summer for the coastal regions, which happens to be one of the most crowded regions in the US. Therefore, prolonged or more strict social distancing ought to be put into action to contain the virus. We also analyzed the anticipated disease transmission in major US cities in both summer (August) and winter (December) climates, as shown in Figure 5 (e) and (f). Compared to summer, there is a higher chance of droplet-based infections in winter, while the aerosolization rate merely changes.

A proper design of ventilation systems by directing wind away from people and preventing mixing of airflow in a public area can vastly reduce both droplet contacts and exposure to aerosol particles. However, our study is still subject to a number of limitations. Firstly, our model predicts how far respiratory droplets can travel under different environmental conditions, and should be combined with infectivity studies of SARS-CoV-2 under all weather conditions. As there is an ongoing debate on the activity of SARS-CoV-2 under different temperature, humidity and sunlight conditions, further studies are necessary to quantify the infectivity variations of SARS-CoV-2 and integrate them in the current model. Secondly, the dynamics of droplets are assumed to be independent on other droplets. Recent works demonstrate that a turbulent gas cloud can be produced with exhalation, which entrains the droplet and suppress its evaporation.(20) To address this issue, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the multiphase turbulent cloud can be used to explore the interactions between droplet and cloud, cloud and the environment, as well as droplet and the environment. However, it is beyond the scope of current study. Thirdly, the composition of a respiratory droplet is complicated and we modeled it as the physiological saline solution. The effect of droplet composition on the activities of SARS-CoV-2 as the droplet evaporates warrants further research.",
