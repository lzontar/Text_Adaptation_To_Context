The influence of these parameters on the structure and morphology of PHB organogels and scaffolds was elucidated using small-angle neutron scattering and scanning electron microscopy. The organogels and scaffolds in this study have a complex hierarchical structure, extending over a wide range of length scales. In vitro viability assays were performed using the human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), and all PHB scaffolds demonstrated the excellent cell viability. Microporosity had the greatest impact on HaCaT cell proliferation on PHB scaffolds, which was determined after a 3-day incubation period with scaffolds of different morphologies and mechanical properties.

By mixing an appropriate non-solvent into a homogeneous polymer solution, the polymer-solvent affinity decreases to induce a liquid-liquid phase separation. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] This forms an interpenetrating network of a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-poor phase referred to as nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS). Liquid-liquid phase separation of a polymer solution can be induced, by non-solvent addition and by changing temperature. This is referred as temperature-induced phase separation (TIPS). [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Theoretically, a polymer-rich phase consists of the polymer and a fraction of the solvent. A polymer-poor phase contains a non-solvent and the remaining solvent. For semi-crystalline polymers, crystallization occurs in the polymer-rich phase. As a result, the solution forms a gel as microcrystallites serve as junctions for a three dimensional (3-D) network. [1] [2] [3] [4] 8, [24] [25] [26] The polymer-rich phase develops the skeleton of the gel monolith, whereas the polymer-poor phase flows through the matrix, resulting in porous channels within the monolith. These organogels can become high-quality scaffolds with high porosity after careful removal of the solvents. Furthermore, the unique nanofibrous structure can be produced by suitably manipulating processing conditions of phase separation and drying procedures. 10, 12, 27 Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is a semi-crystalline, linear polyester synthesized by microorganisms. It receives considerable attention in the literature, owing to its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, and mechnaical strength, suitable for scaffold materials within tissue engineering. [28] [29] [30] PHB has shown promise as scaffolding material for the regeneration of various tissues including cardiovascular and heart valve, nerve conduit, cartilage, liver, skin and bone tissues. 29, 30 However, for tissue engineering applications, the physical and mechanical properties of PHB need to be improved. The main limitation of PHB is the lack of hydrophilicity and bioactivity. PHB composites with hydrophilic and bioactive modifiers have been intensively investigated to overcome these problems. In particular, the addition of bioceramics such as hydroxyapatite and bioglass to the PHB matrix has been shown to improve biological activity and the mechanical properties of PHB scaffolds. This has resulted in enhanced cell attachment and proliferation for bone tissue engineering. [31] [32] [33] In designing a tissue engineering scaffold, connected micropores play a major role in triggering the regeneration of new tissues. The simplest method to develop macroporous matrices is the particulate-leaching method involving the leaching of soluble particulates or porogens. In comparison with scaffolds produced by the particulate-leaching method, scaffolds produced by TIPS show higher mechanical strength, while maintaining the same porosity degree. Tissue engineering scaffolds made of PHB and its copolymers with well-connected micropores have previously been prepared by TIPS. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] NIPS have also been applied to produce highly porous Macromolecular Research and nanofibrous PHB scaffolds using chloroform (CF) as the solvent and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the non-solvent. 10, 12 It has been shown that the morphology and properties of PHB scaffolds can be modulated by varying the solvent composition (i.e., the THF/CF volume ratio). 10 However, the relationship between cell viability, scaffold morphology and properties has not previously been tested. In addition, one of the most important parameters, the polymer concentration effect on the scaffold structures, has been neglected in previous studies. 10 To date, quantitative structural characterization of PHB gels prepared by NIPS or TIPS has only been performed for crystallization behavior. 10, 11 The current study deals with the quantative analysis of the multiscale structure of PHB organogels and scaffolds, from the nanoto micro-range, by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The effects of polymer concentration on the morphology and properties of the PHB scaffolds manufactured by NIPS was examined, providing a more complete understanding of the relationship between fabrication parameters and scaffold properties. Finally, the in vitro biocompatibility was characterized using the human keratinocytes cell line (HaCaT) to assess the potential for PHB scaffolds to be used in tissue engineering applications. Compared to numerous studies on various cells for bone and cardiovascular tissues, relatively little research has been undertaked using PHB and its copolymers to support HaCaT cell growth for skin tissue engineering. 12, 29, [34] [35] [36] Excellent control of the scaffold structure by NIPS makes it possible to compare cell proliferation on PHB scaffolds with various morphology and mechanical properties.

The welldefined nanofibers changed into an almost non-fibrous skeleton surrounding well-connected micropores with increasing nonsolvent content ( Figure 5(A) , (I)). 10 According to NIPS theory, the polymer-poor phase consists mostly of a non-solvent. A lower non-solvent fraction (THF/CF ratio of 30/70) can lead to a smaller or fewer polymer-poor regions, which uniformly interpenetrate the polymer-rich phases in the organogels, resulting in a welldefined nanofiber morphology of the resulting scaffold after solvent evaporation ( Figure 5(A) ). By increasing the THF/CF ratio to 60/40 at fixed \u03c6 (0.03 g/mL), the nanofibrous morphology was suppressed substantially and the microporous morphology became dominant ( Figure 5(I) ). 10 SANS result shows that increasing the THF/CF ratio not only increases the size of the polymer-poor phase but also increases the PHB concentration in the PHB-rich phase due to the decreased CF content. The larger polymer-poor phase can form micropores, and the congested environment of polymer-rich phase may inhibit nanofiber formation after drying. Here, the effect of polymer concentration on the morphology of scaffolds prepared by NIPS was investigated using SEM. Figure 5 shows SEM images of scaffolds with different THF/CF ratios and \u03c6 values. The microporosity increased with decreasing PHB concentration, regardless of the solvent composition. Similarly, the microporosity of polycarbonate scaffolds prepared by NIPS increased with decreasing polymer concentration. 6 The volume ratio of the polymer-poor phase to the polymer-rich phase increased with decreasing \u03c6, which resulted in increased microporosity. As shown in Figure 5 , the correlation between polymer concentration and nanofibrous morphology is rather complicated. Nanofibrous scaffolds (observed at THF/CF ratio of 30/70 and 43/57) had a non-fibrous morphology at low polymer concentrations (\u03c6 = 0.005 g/mL, Figure 5(D), (H) ). Similarly, the skeleton size of porous polycarbonate scaffolds prepared by NIPS became larger with decreasing polymer concentration. 6 In contrast, as shown in Figure 5 (I), 5(L), and Figure 6 , at fixed THF/CF ratio of 60/40, the microporous scaffold with \u03c6 = 0.005 g/mL displayed a more developed nanofiber morphology compared to that of scaffolds with higher \u03c6. The results indicates that the opimal \u03c6 range in which the polymer can form a well-defined nanofibrous morphology, shifted to a lower range of \u03c6 for THF/ CF ratio of 60/40 compared to THF/CF ratio of 30/70 and 43/57. Different value of \u03c6 range for achieving a well-defined nanofi-brous morphology with different THF/CF ratio can be understood as follows. The scaffolds have the same \u03c6, but scaffolds with THF/CF ratio of 60/40 have a more congested environment of polymer-rich phases due to reduced CF content, which requires lower \u03c6 range to form nanofibers compared to that of the scaffolds with THF/CF ratio of 30/70 and 43/57. Here, it has been demonstrated that the morphology of PHB scaffolds obtained by NIPS largely depends upon the polymer concentration, as well as the solvent composition (ratio).

The compressive stress-strain curves of PHB scaffolds showed a linear elastic region at low strain and a non-linear plastic deformation plateau beyond the yield point. The initial linear elasticity for highly porous materials is associated with pore wall bending, and the long plateau in the stress-strain curves is related to the collapse of the pore wall. When the strain reached 60%, the compressive stress increased rapidly, possibly because the pore walls touch each other and form solid bulks under increasing stress. The compressive modulus is derived from the slope of the initial linear portion of the stress-strain curve. The plateau stress is defined as the stress value at a strain of 0.2. The effect of solvent composition and polymer concentration on the compressive moduli and plateau stress of PHB scaffolds is summarized in Figure 7 . As discussed previously, the PHB scaffolds became mechanically weaker with increasing THF/ CF ratios. 10 The absence of a nanofibrous structure was responsible for the decreased mechanical properties of the PHB scaffolds at higher THF/CF ratios. As the polymer concentration increased, PHB scaffolds became markedly stronger despite their similar porosities.

A cell viability assay was used to evaluate the cytocompatibility of the scaffolds fabricated by NIPS. HaCaT seeded on PHB scaffolds were cultured for 3 days, and their viability was evaluated using the CCK-8 assay and SEM. Excellent viability of HaCaT cells was observed after a 3-day culture on all of the scaffolds (Figure 8 ).

Furthermore, the absence of nanofibers led to a greatly reduced surface area and a poorer mechanical strength compared to those of scaffolds with lower THF/CF ratios.

The structural configuration on the micron length scale, in the low Q range < 0.005 \u00c5 -1 , arose due to the presence of two separated phases: PHB-rich and PHB-poor.
