Recycling rates are based on the amount of waste sent to recycling companies rather than the actual amount of recycled materials (Rose & Stegemann, 2018) . Even if the recycling rate is representative, recycling is not the most sustainable approach in waste management since it is still highly wasteful and usually decreases the quality of materials. In other words, materials entail a loss of utility after recycling. Energy and natural resource consumption, pollution generation, and greenhouse gas emissions are less for reuse.

These facilities range from large arenas and conference centers to office spaces and hotels (Johnson, 2020). The inherent flexibility in such buildings such as flexible open plans, non-centralized HVAC systems and temporary interior divisions make them ideal for temporary conversion. Buildings that are able to incorporate future adaptability and in the response to COVID are able to temporarily convert to other uses, are defined in literature as adaptable buildings.

Building refurbishment projects can be divided into three categories to include minor, medium and major refurbishment works. Minor refurbishment J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f considers the next five years and involves maintenance and repair objectives that are economically justified within this shorter time frame. Medium refurbishment considers the extension of the economic life of the building by 15 years and involves the improvement of building finishes and services and excludes structural repairs.

Inclusion of passive systems and technologies including smart metering systems and intelligent occupant controls for improvement of occupant comfort as well as improvements to the energy efficiency of the building, is also part of retrofitting (Albatici et al., 2016). Benefits of retrofitting include reduced dependence on energy sources, improvements to indoor air quality and comfort, and reduction of global warming potential. Other benefits include a reduction in maintenance and repair costs and overall improved socio-economic well-being of the existing building stock (Pardo-Bosch et al., 2019). In the process of retrofitting, costs and payback regarding each strategy ultimately lead to a feasibility assessment and decision making process (Albatici et al., 2016). Barriers to retrofitting include a lack of understanding of benefits and access to reliable information and financial models. These include high costs, risk management and long pay-back periods, amongst others.

In the process of rehabilitation, the two main activities conducted are the dismantling of troubled areas, and remediation and new construction work(S\u00e1ez & Osmani, 2019). The scope of building rehabilitation projects can include direct rehabilitation of the structure and the combination of rehabilitation with other refurbishment strategies and the integration of new construction(Thibodeau et al., 2019).The rehabilitation efforts defined here focus on structural repairs that will make buildings safe and habitable. In order to determine the viability of a rehabilitation project, both economic and life cycle assessments are compared to the option of demolition and new construction (Alba-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fRodr\u00edguez et al., 2017). Rehabilitation work is most influential for improving the environmental life cycle due to the prevention of demolition(Thibodeau et al., 2019). The environmental impact of rehabilitation of a failing structure is estimated to be approximately 60% less than demolition and new construction(Alba-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2017).
