            "text": "COVID-19 has recently become a major pandemic with associated socioeconomic dimensions. Mortality statistics suggest that COVID-19 is more lethal in aged patients with comorbid conditions including hypertension. There is ongoing debate about whether the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are useful or hazardous in patients with COVID-19, with both narratives supported by researchers with different hypotheses. The researchers supporting the use of these medications believe ACE2 functional blockers may block cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus improve patient outcomes. The counter viewpoint argues that continuous use of these drugs results in hyperexpression of ACE2 receptors on respiratory epithelium allowing easier SARS-CoV-2 intracellular entry, resulting in enhanced viral replication and tissue damage. This short review discusses the available research on the subject with the objective to consolidate data to allow formulation of recommendations on their use or otherwise. Moreover, the authors also suggest areas for future research on the subject.",

            "text": "The discovery of the novel coronavirus (nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, dates back to December 2019 when multiple cases of atypical pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China [1] . Although initially thought to be a variant of coronavirus with moderate communicability, the virus resulted in an upsurge in mortality, especially among seniors with co-morbid conditions [2] . Within a matter of weeks the outbreak from Wuhan spread to all corners of the world and was labeled as a pandemic with millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths [3] . With this growing menace, it is prudent to pinpoint the specific factors leading to adverse outcomes and the opportunities to explore from these challenges. A plethora of half-truths and low-grade evidence is emerging every day, confusing treating physicians. One example is the treatment of patients with hypertension with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), with opinions on their use ranging from harm to no harm to providing benefits with regard to COVID-19.",

SARS-CoV-2 also acts through similar receptors to enter cells where the virus preferentially replicates in respiratory epithelia [5] . There are two schools of thought regarding the role of cellular ACE2 receptors. In one, the continuous use of ACEi and ARBs increases the expression of ACE2 on cellular surfaces, which, once exposed to SAR-CoV-2, increases viral intracellular entry, thus enhancing viral replication [6] . In the other, ACE functional blockers block cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and thus improve patient outcomes [7] . The detailed mechanism of action of ACE and angiotensin are shown in Fig. 1 . The existing literature also suggests that raised ACE and angiotensin-II levels are not good prognostic indicators [8] . This short review will attempt to address and consolidate the prevailing evidence about the use of ARBs and ACEi in subjects with COVID-19.",

In theory, it seems that the mechanistic effect of these drugs in causing ACE2 receptor up-regulation could allow SARS-CoV-2 to find more targets to attack and infect, thus worsening the patient's condition. Conversely, avoiding the use of ACEi and ARBs in patients with hypertension could cause result in worsening of hypertension control and accelerated adverse cardiovascular effects. The data in Table 1 highlight the weaknesses in the available evidence [7, [16] [17] [18] [19] . The results of the animal model study by Imai et al. suggest that administering ACEi reverses induced lung damage, suggesting that ARBs and ACEi may have utility in COVID-19 cases involving similar lung damage [11] . The recent position statements by the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association suggest continuing current treatment with ARBs and ACEi in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 [24, 25] . However, in our opinion, further research in COVID-19 animal models or RCTs is much needed to clarify the mechanistic details of ACE2 interactions with SARS-Cov-2 and medications and their combined interactions. Although medical science can never provide complete answers to the many questions raised, the way forward for further research needs to delineated. From this discussion and data review, it seems increased ACE2 expression is beneficial to avoid lung injury and possibly cardiotoxicity; thus it may be useful in avoiding complications in non-hypertensive subjects with COVID-19 [11, 12] . Furthermore, due to the shortcomings of the currently available data, differences in individual statements and position statements, and the repeated call or caution, results from well-designed trials are required to avoid any degree of ambiguity in short-term and possible long-term side effects [19, 20, 22, 23] .

The use of ARBs or ACEi to manage COVID-19 in nonhypertensive patients is not recommended (evidence grade: D). 3. More quality trials are needed to study the beneficial and harmful effects of ACEi and ARB use in hypertensive patients infected with COVID-19 (evidence grade: C).",
