Currently, there is no effective vaccine or drugs against the ASFV. How to effectively control the virus is challenging. In this study, we have analyzed all the publicly available ASFV genomes and demonstrated that there was a large genetic diversity of ASFV genomes. Interestingly, the genetic diversity was mainly caused by extensive genomic insertions and/or deletions (indels) instead of the point mutations. Further analyses showed that the indels may be attributed much to the homologous recombination, as supported by significant associations between the occurrence of extensive recombination events and the indels in the ASFV genomes. Besides, the homologous recombination also led to changes of gene content of ASFVs. Finally, repeated elements of dozens of nucleotides in length were observed to widely distribute and cluster in the adjacent positions of ASFV genomes, which may facilitate the occurrence of homologous recombination.

The genome of the virus belongs to double-stranded DNA, with the size ranging from 170 kb to 190 kb (Dixon et al., 2013) . ASFV mainly infect suids and soft ticks.

ASFV was firstly discovered in Kenya in 1921 (Arzt et al., 2010) . It remained restricted in Africa till 1957, when it was reported in Spain and Portugal. Up to now, the virus has caused ASF outbreaks in more than fifty countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and South America (Costard et al., 2013) .

As shown in Fig. S11 , the number of repeated elements in ASFV genomes decreased monotonously as the size of elements increased. Then, the distances between adjacent elements for a given repeated element was investigated (Fig. 5A) . As the size of the elements increased from 5 to 10, the average distance between the adjacent elements also increased because the number of repeated elements in the genome decreased and the repeated elements became more disperse in the genome. Interestingly, the average distance decreased as the size of the elements increased from 11 to 33; it reached to the minimum (136 bp) when the size was 33; then the distance kept unchanged as the size increased from 33 to 49; finally, it increased as the size of repeated element increased from 50 to 100. It should be noted that the average distance was still less than 300 bp even for the repeated elements of 100 bp. These phenomena suggested that the repeated elements of 11 bp or larger tended to cluster in the genome, especially for those of 33-49 bp. For example, when the size of elements was 30 bp, each genome had a median of 427 types of elements which repeated at least two times in the genome. Some elements appeared for over ten times in the genome, such as the element \"AGGCGTTAAACATTAAAATTATTACTACTG\" in the viral strain BA71 V.

Large diversity was observed among the genomes and the genes of ASFVs, which may lead to diverse phenotype, such as the diversity in antigen and virulence. Indels were found to have a larger contribution to the genetic diversity of ASFVs than the point mutations. This was similar to that observed in a previous study by Lin, during which the author found that insertion/deletion of simple sequence repeat (SSR) could cause large genetic variations in phages (Lin, 2016) . Compared to point mutations, indels could introduce a larger variation to the genome, and cause a more severe damage to the genome structures, which may lead to the death of viruses (Wang et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2018) . Therefore, only few indels were observed in viruses with small genomes, such as influenza viruses (Taubenberger and Kash, 2010) and hepatitis C viruses (HCV) (Torres-Puente et al., 2007) . However, it was more robust for the indels to occur inside the viruses with large genomes, such as ASFVs (Dixon et al., 2013) , poxviruses (Elde et al., 2012) and phages (Lin, 2016) , because the viruses with large genomes had lots of repeated elements (such as SSRs) and duplicated genes (such as MGFs). Moreover, indels may provide a more efficient way of survival than the point mutations under the natural Zhu, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 236 (2019) 108380 selection pressure (Dixon et al., 2013; Lin, 2016; Elde et al., 2012) , since the virus with indels could rapidly change its phenotype, such as antigen, virulence, or ability of replication and transcription. For example, the deletion of some MGF genes in ASFV could reduce the viral replication or virulence, which may help with the viral infection of soft ticks (Dixon et al., 2013; Burrage et al., 2004) . As Dixon et al. pointed out, gene families are commonly involved in the evolution of DNA viruses with large genomes (Dixon et al., 2013) . For example, the poxviruses can rapidly acquired fitness via recurrent amplification of a key anti-host defence gene (Elde et al., 2012) . The ASFV genomes have five MGF families, each of which has 3-22 MGF genes (Dixon et al., 2013) . Previous studies have shown that most genome variation in ASFVs was as the result of gain or loss of MGF genes (Dixon et al., 2013) . This study found that the member of MGF families were frequently involved in recombinations. They accounted for more than 2/3 of gene insertions or deletions when comparing the proteome of ASFVs.

As a proof, significant associations were observed between the occurrence of recombination events and the indels. The clustered repeated elements observed in ASFV genomes may facilitate the homologous recombination (Fig. 5) .

Besides the short repeated elements, there are also an abundance of long repeated elements, such as those longer than 30 bp. The clustered long repeated elements can facilitate the ectopic homologous recombination, which lead to large indels including the gene insertions/deletions. This work provides some insights into the prevention and control of the ASFVs. Since the virus can rapidly change its phenotypes, such as the antigen, traditional methods of developing vaccines or drugs may be ineffective, as was demonstrated in previous studies (Escribano et al., 2013; Arabyan et al., 2018; Sanchez et al., 2019) . Identification of the conservative antigenic epitopes or drug targets may help for development of effective vaccines and drugs. Besides, development of drugs targeting host proteins instead of viral proteins may be an alternative strategy (Han et al., 2017) . Moreover, since the recombination play a large role in shaping the genetic diversity of the virus, coupling the drugs which inhibit the recombination process with the traditional drugs or vaccines, may help prevention and control of the viral infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 305, "end": 325, "text": "(Dixon et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 946, "end": 970, "text": "(Escribano et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 971, "end": 992, "text": "Arabyan et al., 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 993, "end": 1014, "text": "Sanchez et al., 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1274, "text": "(Han et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There were some limitations to this study. Firstly, the number of ASFV genomes was limited, which hindered a comprehensive analysis on the evolution of ASFV genomes. Previous studies have identified over twenty genotypes of ASFVs (Boshoff et al., 2007; Bastos et al., 2003) , among which only seven genotypes were included in this study. Fortunately, the isolates included in this study covered a long time period from 1950 to 2018, and also covered a large area including Africa, Europe and China, which were the major areas of the ASFV circulation. Besides, the genotype II, the most widely spread genotype in recent years (Ge et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Quembo et al., 2018; Garigliany et al., 2019) , were also included and constituted nearly half of all ASFVs. Thus the results based on these isolates could reflect the genetic diversity of the ASFVs to a large extent. Secondly, the location and size of the indels observed in ASFV genomes may be affected by the sequence alignment algorithm. Two common methods, i.e., MAFFT and ClustalW, for the alignment of ASFV genomes were used in this study. In both methods, the indels were observed to contribute much more to the genetic diversity than the point mutations did (Fig. S3) , suggesting the robustness of the results. Lastly, the extensively repeated elements in ASFV genomes could facilitate the frequent occurrence of recombination events. However, some of recombination events cannot be detected by the recombination detection method because of the exchange between the genomic segments with small indels. Such kinds of recombination events are difficult to detect. Increasing the sensitivity of the recombination detection method can help detect them, but may also bring false positives. Therefore, the sensitivity and specificity should be balanced in the recombination detection methods.Overall, this work provided a systematic view of the genetic diversity of ASFVs. Extensive homologous recombination detected in this study may contribute much to the widespread indels observed in ASFV genomes, which further lead to the large genetic diversity of ASFVs.
