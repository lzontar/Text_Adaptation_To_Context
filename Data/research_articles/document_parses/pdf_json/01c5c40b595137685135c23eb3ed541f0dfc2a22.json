Although survival time after lung transplantation is typically limited, transplantation can confer substantial benefi ts, including prolongation of life, to selected candidates with advanced lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) [ 1 ] .

In 1999, the US Department of Health and Human Services issued the \"Final Rule,\" which requires that deceased organ allocation systems de-emphasize waiting time and instead allocate organs based on \"objective and measureable medical criteria\u2026 ordered from most to least medically urgent\u2026\" [ 19 ] . In response, UNOS/OPTN and the SRTR developed the Lung Allocation Score (LAS) system, which was put into place on May 4, 2005 [ 20 ] . The LAS system prioritizes waiting list candidates based on two criteria: medical urgency (the predicted risk of dying within 1 year) and estimated transplant benefi t (the number of additional days of life expected from lung transplantation during the next year). Transplant benefi t is calculated as the difference between expected survival time after lung transplantation and expected waiting list survival time (medical urgency). Medical urgency and expected survival after lung transplantation are estimated from multivariable regression models that contain the predictors given in Table 18 .5 . The LAS, which varies from 0 to 100, is then derived from output of these models. Those with the greater medical urgency and expected transplant benefi t receive higher LAS scores. After accounting for other criteria (geographic proximity to the donor, pediatric age, and blood type), deceased donor lungs are offered fi rst to those with higher LAS scores. The LAS has been updated since its inception to include [ 6 ] the addition of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, and the addition of serum bilirubin is planned (to aid the estimation of medical urgency for those with right heart failure due to pulmonary arterial hypertension).
