Their genes reside in the same locus (16B3), and the Parp-9 gene lies head-to-head and shares its promoter with the gene encoding its partner, Bbap. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of Parp-9, Parp-14, and Bbap expression during mouse development and adulthood. Parp-9 is developmentally regulated, and prominently expressed in the thymus and specific regions of the brain and gut. In adults, highest expression is maintained in the thymus and intestine. Parp-14 is more weakly expressed, mainly in the thymus during development and in adulthood. In addition, we show that Bbap is essentially coexpressed with Parp-9 during development and in adult mouse. However, the different levels of their transcripts detected in the developing brain and gut suggest that Bbap and Parp-9 display both common and independent tissue-specific regulations.",

PARP-1, the founding member of the PARP family, is a molecular sensor of DNA breaks, playing a key role in the spatial and temporal organization of break repair through the local synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) at damaged sites. In addition to its critical involve-ment in cellular response to DNA damage, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been ascribed to regulate various biological processes such as transcription, mitotic segregation, telomere homeostasis, cell proliferation, transformation, and cell death (Schreiber et al., 2006) . The diversity of PAR functions is a consequence of the variety of the functional domains combined to the PARP domain in each PARP family member.",

A macro domain is present within the histone variant macroH2A that is associated to transcriptional repression and X chromosome inactivation (Angelov et al., 2003) . Interestingly, this domain is able to negatively regulate PARP-1 activity on particular promoters that must remain inactive in the absence of appropriated stimulation or on the inactive X chromosome (Ouararhni et al., 2006; Nusinow et al., 2007) . Macro domains were recently shown to bind ADP-ribose and its derivatives (Karras et al., 2005) . Those of PARP-9 and of some RNA virus encoding nonstructural proteins (from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus SARS-CoV, the hepatitis E virus, and the Semliki Forest virus) are indeed able to bind poly(ADP-ribose) (Karras et al., 2005; Egloff et al., 2006) .",

PARP-9/BAL1 overexpression stimulates cell migration in vitro, suggesting a role for PARP-9/BAL1 in the promotion of malignant B cell migration and dissemination in high risk DLBCL (Aguiar et al., 2000) . Murine Parp-14, also named Coast6, was described as a cofactor of Stat6 in a pathway activated by interleukin 4 (IL-4; Goenka and Boothby, 2006) . Its coactivating property requires functional PARP activity (Goenka et al., 2007) . PARP-9/BAL1 is also likely a transcription coactivator, its overexpression in B lymphocytes, stimulated by interferon gamma (IFN\u2425), inducing the transcription of IFN\u2425-controlled genes (Juszczynski et al., 2006) . PARP-9/BAL1 was shown to interact with BBAP (B-lymphoma and BAL-associated protein), a ring finger E3 ligase of the DELTEX family, capable of heterodimerization with DTX members and self-ubiquitination (Takeyama et al., 2003) . DELTEX proteins participate in Notch signaling pathway that controls cell fate determination, notably in myogenesis, neurogenesis, lymphogenesis, and intestinal homeostasis (Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999) . BBAP was proposed to regulate the subcellular localization of PARP-9/BAL1, sequestering it within the cytoplasm (Juszczynski et al., 2006) .",

Parp-9 was expressed in some craniofacial tissues, namely the telencephalic vesicles, hypothalamus, pituitary, olfactory bulb and nasal cavity, illustrated at E14.5 and E17.5, Fig. 1E ,H and data not shown) and in the developing intervertebral disks (Fig. 1E , see the caudal prevertebrae). Additionally, Parp-9 expression was also regionalized in the epithelium of the developing palate and mouth cavity (Fig. 1E ). In the developing intestine, Parp-9 transcripts were detected at E14.5 in the midgut loops and the rectum (Fig. 1E ). Specific expression was also detected in both epithelial and mesenchymal regions of the urogenital sinus (Fig. 1E ). The restricted expression in the posterior part of the gut (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, rectum) was observed until E18.5 and maintained postnatally (Fig. 4 , and see below).",

Therefore, whereas Parp-1 expression seems to be related to T-cell proliferation, macroParps expression is more likely related to T-cell selection or maturation. Differential expression was also seen in the adult spleen ( Fig. 2J -L), with a moderate expression of the three genes in the marginal zone and the white pulp. In addition, we found that Peyer's patches and lymphoid follicles, which are secondary lymphoid organs located in the intestine and colon wall, respectively, also moderately express the three genes ( Fig. 2M-O) . Of interest, only Parp-1 is highly expressed in the germinal centers of Peyer's patches and colon lymphoid follicles (Fig. 2M) , which correspond to sites of B-cell selection and proliferation after antigen stimuli.",

At E12.5 and E14.5, Parp-9 transcripts were observed in the urogenital sinus, both in the epithelium and mesenchyme at the base of the bladder and the genital tubercule (Fig. 1E) . This finding suggests a specific function of Parp-9 in the early development of urogenital regions. From E14.5 to E18.5, expression of Parp-9 was detected in the duodenum, midgut loops, and rectum (Fig. 1E , 4B,E). No expression was detected in more anterior foregut derivatives (esophagus, stomach). Interestingly, at late developmental stages from E16.5 to E18.5, a clear difference between Parp-1 and Parp-9 transcript distributions was observed. The level of Parp-1 transcripts was highest in undifferentiated cells at the bottom of the intestinal crypts, in intestine and colon (Fig. 4D) . On the opposite, Parp-9 expression was detected throughout the entire villi (Fig. 4E ). This differential expression pattern was maintained in adulthood. Parp-1 expression was detected in the crypts of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon (Fig. 4F ,H, and data not shown). In the colon, expression was extending to the bottom of the crypts, but progressively decreased toward the lumen (Fig. 4H) . Parp-9 was expressed in the enterocytes of the entire epithelium of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon ( Fig. 4G ,I, and data not shown). In duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, Parp-9 expression was slightly higher from the bottom of the crypt to the crypt-villus junction, and gradually decreased toward more differentiated cells along the axis of the villi (Fig. 4G and data not shown) . In the colon, expression was homogenous throughout the epithelia, from the crypts to the lumen. The presence of Parp-1 in the proliferating cells of the intestinal crypts could be justified by the necessity for the maintenance of genome integrity in intestinal stem cells and progenitors. The presence of Parp-9 in the enterocytes of the entire villi suggests on the other hand that Parp-9 could be involved in differentiation or migration of the enterocytes, or in their absorptive function. Its ex- pression at embryonic day 12.5, before villi formation (Crosnier et al., 2006) , strongly suggests that it could be involved in morphogenesis of the intestine.",

            "text": "In summary, we have shown that the macroPARPs Parp-9 and Parp-14 display distinct expression profiles during mouse development and in adult tissues. Parp-9 is developmentally regulated, prominently expressed in the thymus, in specific regions of the central nervous system and of the gut. This regionalized expression pattern during mouse organogenesis suggests that Parp-9 could have a function in lymphogenesis, neurogenesis, and development of the intestine. In the adult mouse, the highest levels of Parp-9 transcripts were found in the medulla of the thymus, suggesting a role for Parp-9 in thymocytes maturation. Parp-14 also likely plays a role during thymic development and function, because this organ is the major site of Parp-14 expression, although at low levels. Interestingly, human PARP-9/BAL1 and mouse Parp-14/Coast6 were reported to act in the transcriptional regulation of gene expression activated by IFN\u2425 and IL-4, respectively (Goenka and Boothby, 2006; Juszczynski et al., 2006) . These two cytokines can antag-onize each other's function in thymocytes maturation and macrophage activation during the immune response (Ohmori and Hamilton, 1997) , raising the hypothesis of a possible antagonistic function for Parp-9 and Parp-14 in the immune response. Parp-9 was also expressed at higher levels in the enterocytes of the intestine, suggesting specific function(s) that could be related to homeostasis, nutrient digestion, and absorption, or to the barrier and defense function against toxic compounds or pathogenic microorganisms. Finally, we have shown that Bbap, the gene sharing a common promoter with Parp-9, is coexpressed with Parp-9 during mouse development and in mouse adulthood, suggesting that Bbap and Parp-9 share a common regulation. However, some additional tissue-specific gene regulation may exist, with Parp-9 being expressed at higher levels in the developing gut than in brain, and with the opposite for Bbap. Therefore, Bbap and Parp-9 display both common and independent tissue-specific regulations.",

Adult organs were dissected from 12-week-old CD1 male mice, except for brains that were taken from females, and frozen in Shandon Cryomatrix (Thermo Electron Corporation) embedding medium. Serial cryosections (10 or 25 m) were collected on gelatin-coated (Superfrost Plus, Kindler) slides. In situ hybridization was performed as described at http://empress.har.mrc. ac.uk/browser: gene expression section). Some of the experiments were performed using a Tecan GenePaint Robot and a Tyramide signal amplification method (for details, see www. eurexpress.org and www.genepaint. org). In each hybridization experiment, control sense probes were included, allowing the determination of possible false-positive signal. Two to four embryos and adult organs were analyzed for each probe. The sex of the embryos between E14.5 and E18.5 was determined from the histology of the gonads. At least one male and one female were analyzed for E14.5, E15.5-E16.5, and E17.5-E18.5. No significant difference in the expression patterns was observed between male and female embryos. Except for E17.5 (Fig. 1) , all the illustrations represent female embryos.",
