Human sewage contains enteric bacteria as normal flora, and has the potential to contain parasites, bacteria and viruses which may prove pathogenic to Antarctic wildlife. Treatment can reduce levels of micro-organisms in sewage effluent, but is not a requirement of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol). In contrast, the deliberate release of non-native organisms for any other reason is prohibited. Hence, disposal of sewage effluent to the marine environment is the only activity routinely undertaken in Antarctica knowing that it will likely result in the release of large numbers of potentially non-native species.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "When the Madrid Protocol was negotiated, the decision to allow release of untreated sewage effluent was considered the only pragmatic option, as a prohibition would have been costly, and may not have been achievable by many Antarctic operators. In addition, at that time the potential for transmission of pathogens to wildlife from sewage was not emphasised as a significant potential risk. Since then, the transmission of disease-causing agents between species is more widely recognised and it is now timely to consider the risks of continued discharge of sewage effluent in Antarctica and whether there are practical alternatives.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this chapter we describe sewage treatment technologies used in Antarctica both in the past and currently, we summarise the regulations governing sewage disposal in Antarctica and discuss aspects of the Antarctic environment that may constrain the implementation in Antarctica of new sewage treatment technologies. We then summarise the potential environmental impacts of sewage effluent, discuss the documented extent of sewage and faecal contamination in Antarctica and review studies of the survivability of faecal micro-organisms in the Antarctic environment. We review the range of pathogens known to be commonly associated with sewage and discuss Antarctic-specific factors that might influence which pathogens are present in sewage from Antarctic operations. To assess whether there is a link between exposure to sewage effluent and microbial colonisation, infection, or virulence acquisition, we review reports of sewage-associated pathogens in Antarctic wildlife and of uptake of faecal bacteria. Finally, we consider whether there is any evidence for a link between exposure of wildlife to sewage and ill health.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Consumption of food and water and production of the by-products of human metabolism are unavoidable, absolute requirements for human survival.

Delille and Delille (2000) detected total coliform bacteria in crowded Ad\u00e9lie penguin colonies in the vicinity of Dumont d'Urville Station.

Significantly higher concentrations of total and faecal coliforms, E. coli, enterococci and C. perfringens were found in sediments at these sites than in the water column. Low levels of group II F+ RNA coliphage, presumed to be human-derived, were found in a single water sample (Little Razorback) and in sediment samples (Big Razorback). These were the same genotype, presumed to be human-derived, as that found in untreated sewage from McMurdo Station. Nearby sea-ice camps that dispose of faecal material into ice holes drilled into the annual sea-ice could not be ruled out as the source of these coliphage. Additionally, analysis of Weddell seal scats, as well as rectal swabs, indicated the presence of C. perfringens, faecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci at concentrations similar to that in sewage solids from sediments proximal to McMurdo Station outfall (Lisle et al. 2004 ).
