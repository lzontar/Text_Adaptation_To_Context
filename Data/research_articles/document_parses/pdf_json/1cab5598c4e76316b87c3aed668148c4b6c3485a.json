Based on our previous experience, we have now designed HR1-and HR2-derived peptides, designated 2019-nCoV-HR1P (aa924-965) and 2019-nCoV-HR2P (aa1168-1203), respectively (Fig. 1c) , and explored their biological characteristics. Since the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV S-HR2 sequences are 100% identical, 2019-nCoV-HR2P may act as a fusion inhibitor in much the same way as our reported SARS-CoV fusion inhibitor, SARS-HR2P. 4 Under native electrophoresis as described before, 4 2019-nCoV-HR2P, which carries negative charges, moved down to a lower gel position, while 2019-nCoV-HR1P, which carries positive charges, moved up and off the gel (Fig. 1d ) in a manner similar to SARS-CoV-HR1P 4 in native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) assay. Notably, in the 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P mixture, new bands emerged at the upper part in the native-PAGE gel in a 2019-nCoV-HR1P dose-dependent manner, indicating that 2019-nCoV-HR2P could interact with 2019-nCoV-HR1P to form a complex, possibly 6-HB. We then assessed the secondary structures of 2019-nCoV-HR1P, 2019-nCoV-HR2P, and 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P complex, using circular dichroism as previously described. 4 While 2019-nCoV-HR1P alone and 2019-nCoV-HR2P alone exhibited low helicity (<30%), the 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P complex exhibited the characteristic helicity of 6-HB, with minimum values at 208 and 222 nm and helicity of 84.4% (Fig. 1e) . Moreover, the 2019-nCoV-HR1P/2019-nCoV-HR2P complex showed good thermal stability with T m of 66.2 o C (Fig. 1f) .",

On the other hand, 2019-nCoV-HR1P exhibited no significant inhibitory effect at concentrations up to 40 \u00b5M, consistent with other coronavirus HR1-derived peptides, such as SARS-HR1P and MERS-HR1P. 5, 8 We previously reported that the HR1 region in various coronaviruses is a conserved target site, and based on that evidence, we designed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, denoted as EK1. 8 Compared with 2019-nCoV-HR2P, EK1 shows . After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV S protein to the potential receptor ACE2 on the host cell, S2 subunit changes conformation by inserting FP into the cell membranes and triggering the association between the HR1 and HR2 domains to form 6-HB, which brings the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity for fusion (left part of k). In the presence of 2019-nCoV-HR2P or EK1 peptide, three copies of the peptide bind to the 2019-nCoV S-HR1-trimer to form heterologous 6-HB, thus blocking the formation of viral homologous 6-HB and thus inhibiting viral and cell membrane fusion (right part of k). significant sequence variation, but interestingly, EK1 could also bind 2019-nCoV-HR1P in native-PAGE in a manner similar to that of 2019-nCoV-HR2P (Fig. 1h) . The 2019-nCoV-HR1P/EK1 complex also showed high helicity (77.9%) (Fig. 1i) . EK1 also exhibited effective fusion inhibitory activity with IC 50 of 0.19 \u00b5M (Fig. 1g) . Taken together, these results suggest that the 2019-nCoV S-HR1 region is also a promising conserved target for developing effective CoV fusion/entry inhibitors.",
