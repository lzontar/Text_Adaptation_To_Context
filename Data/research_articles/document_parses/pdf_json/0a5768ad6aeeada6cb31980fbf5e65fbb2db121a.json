Viruses from the genus Lyssavirus, usually called lyssaviruses, belonging to Rhabdoviridae of the Mononegavirales order, present a classical case to study the emergence and cross-species transmission of infectious disease [1] . Rabies is an acute and almost invariably fatal encephalomyelitis in humans, usually caused by rabies virus (RABV) infection, which is a single-stranded, negative-sense, non-segmented RNA virus of approximately 12 kilo bases. The genome mainly encodes five proteins: The nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the large protein (L) [2, 3] . RABV can infect a variety of mammalian hosts, especially bats and certain carnivores. It is distributed worldwide and has a high mortality, and remains a permanent threat to public health [4] [5] [6] ; nevertheless, it is still neglected. Lyssaviruses are mainly classified into 16 [7] [8] [9] [10] . Putative species, including Taiwan bat lyssavirus (TBLV) and Kotalahti bat lyssavirus (KBLV), have not yet been classified [11, 12] . Historically, each species of lyssavirus is associated with a specific geographical area and is detected in different hosts and vectors [13] . For instance, EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 are found in serotine bats and Daubenton's bats, respectively, in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Norway, while ABLV is found in pteropid and insectivorous bats in Australia. In addition, RABV is distributed worldwide in dogs and several carnivores, except in Antarctica and a few islands, though it is commonly found in China and India [14] [15] [16] .
