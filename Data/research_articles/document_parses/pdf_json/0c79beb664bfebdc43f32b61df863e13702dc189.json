It is generally accepted that in order to be effective, gamification should be tailored to users. Currently, most systems adapt by assigning different game elements based on a single learner profile (e.g. dominant player type, personality or gender). However, there is no study yet that analyse the effect of combining several profiles. In this paper, we study the usage data from 258 students who used a gamified learning environment as a part of their mathematics class. By simulating different adaptation techniques, we show that the learner model chosen to tailor gamification has significant effects on learners' motivation and engaged behaviours depending on the profile(s) used in this context. We also show that tailoring to initial motivation to learn mathematics can improve intrinsic motivation. Finally, we show that tailoring to both player type and motivation profiles can improve intrinsic motivation, and decrease amotivation, compared to a single adaptation only based on learner motivation.

Previous studies have shown that to be effective gamification should be tailored to users' expectations, and individual preferences [8, 10, 17, 20, 26] . However, adapting game elements to specific individual preferences can be a complex task, as learners can have different preferences towards games, and different motivations for learning. Most systems therefore use learner profiles to categorise and classify learners, based on information such as their player type [18, 22] , personality traits [6] , more rarely learner motivation [28] ), or more context-dependent information, such as learning styles [12] . Existing tailored gamification systems use a single learner profile to recommend relevant game elements. Even if most of these systems have positive results on learner motivation, engagement, and performance, some more recent work shows more mitigated results [16, 29] .

One commonly used player type is the Hexad typology [18] created specifically for gamification, and has been shown to be more effective for gamification than other player profiles [9] . Based on Self Determination Theory [1] , this profile distinguishes six different categories: Philanthropists, Socialisers, Free Spirits, Achievers, Players, and Disruptors, and has been used in several adaptive gamification studies.

However, our study highlights that this engagement is associated with lower performances, which is contradictory with the study reported in [14] , where they found that personalised badges and feedback had a positive effect on maths performance. We also show that an adaptation based only on player types has no effect on learner motivation to learn Mathematics, as also observed in [19] when learning French spelling.

This finding is consistent with other studies on the impact of a tailored gamification based on learner motivation in a technical English course [28] , and a database management course [12] . More precisely, it reduced the decrease in intrinsic motivation for knowledge and made learners more intrinsically motivated to overcome maths challenges.

This finding is in line with previous studies on the impact of tailored gamification that show an increase in perceived fun [19] or flow induced by some game elements depending on the player types [29] . Dual adaptation also reduced learner amotivation to learn Mathematics, which is consistent with the findings of the study conducted in [16] when adapting only to player types. We believe that the dual profile adaptation could be even more reinforced by adding more information on the learners. For example, tailoring to personality traits has shown some promises (see Sect. 2.2). It would therefore be interesting to study whether adding a third or even fourth profile to the learner model would increase the effectiveness of the adaptation.
