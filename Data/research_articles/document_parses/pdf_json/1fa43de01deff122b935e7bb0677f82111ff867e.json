Throughout the last century, the world experienced several global and regional outbreaks: Most severely, millions died during the spread of the Spanish flu in 1918-1920. Regarding the economic impact by sector, Gopinath [11] identifies manufacturing and the services sector as disproportionately affected in China, based on the Purchasing Managers' Index. Ramelli and Wagner [12] uses Google search intensity to measure attention paid to COVID-19 and stock market data to reveal the economic impact by sector. Their analysis shows that the energy, retail, and transportation sector experienced the largest losses in the United States and China, whereas health care gained considerably in both countries. The analysis by Huang et al. [13] (also based on stock market data) confirms that the services sectors seem to be the most severely affected in China. In sum, Baldwin and Mauro [10] provides valuable context, insights and timely policy recommendations. However, none of the recent contributions provide an empirical database to analyse the economic risks of different industries based on up-to-date empirical evidence (beyond highly aggregated stock market signals). 3 At this point we want to highlight that it is not the aim of this study to present a model of risk forecasting that is competing with established macro-economic approaches. In contrast, the data-driven methodology presented here aims to explore an alternative data source that could help to inform such economic models. The advantage of the data we provide here is the high time resolution. More traditional sources of empirical information used to calibrate macro-economic model usually include, for example, unemployment rates.

While government measures against the spread of the disease hinder the population from working and consuming, which results in businesses interrupting production, many economies face demand and supply shocks at the same time. In particular, as different industries rely on distinct input factor compositions and supply chains, the sectors of the economy react differently to shocks [21] .

This study introduces a data-mining approach to measure the reported business risks induced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. We examine company risk reports filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Harnessing this data set enables a real-time analysis of potential risk factors. Preliminary findings show that the companies' risk awareness is preempting stock market developments by weeks. While stock prices typically condense the market's multiple signals, the 10-K reports allow to isolates the company risk perceptions associated to the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, this risk awareness differs substantially between industries, both in magnitude as well as in nature. Based on natural language processing techniques, we can identify specific corona-related risk-topics and their relevance for the different industries: supply chain-and production related issues seem to be mostly relevant for retail and manufacturing, while several industries have reported demand-or finance related risk factors. Additionally, our approach allows to cluster the industries into three groups of reported risk factors, giving a better understanding of which industries are considering the most severe impacts at the current stage. We summarise the corona-related business risk perceptions per industry in a compound index published online. 13 The CoRisk-Index, which will be updated constantly over the course of the crisis, provides an up-to-date database to identify the industries that report most substantial risk factors in the different phases of the unfolding economic crisis.

Nevertheless, our results are limited to this self-assessment. As many of the implications of the corona crisis are still uncertain, our approach thus reflects a way to approximate potential implications on current estimations of experts in the different sectors, represented by the companies, and does not include risks that are unforeseeable for themselves at a given point in time. Moreover, the data to assess the precision of these estimations does not exist yet, as there has not been a pandemic with comparable global economic consequences in recent time. In the future, we will evaluate our results by looking at employment data in different sectors. Moreover, the pandemic continues to spread and will soon affect all industry sectors and all countries of the world.

Nonetheless, the current coronavirus pandemic is, in recent history, unprecedented in its global social and economic consequences. Governments are taking drastic measures while researchers attempt to provide urgently needed policy advice. Much of the coronavirus-related social science and public health research focuses on disease transmission, global spread, and different interventions (see for example[3,4,5,6,7]).In contrast, empirical research investigating the economic impact of COVID-19 is less prevalent. Dorn et al.[8] uses scenario calculations to estimate the economic costs of the pandemic for the case of Germany. The authors estimate the financial consequences for the state budget and the employment effects depending on the length of the economic shutdown. Moreover, they include differential adverse effects by sectors, based on press releases and the provisional Ifo business climate index for March 2020. They conclude that the travel and restaurant industry is likely to face a complete shutdown, whereas the pharmaceutical, logistics and health sectors are likely to continue to operate at full capacity.3 However, such simulations rely mostly on theoretical considerations lacking a strong empirical foundation. In Baldwin and Mauro[9,10] researchers collect a great variety of perspectives on the potential economic implications of COVID-19.
