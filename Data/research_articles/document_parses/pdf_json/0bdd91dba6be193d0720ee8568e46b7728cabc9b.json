All COVID-19 papers in this edition were submitted during the week of 5th March. Many authors acknowledged that even a day after submission they had become outdated. We choose nevertheless to include them, in part, as a record of Europe's response to the pandemic, and in part, as a record of individual emergency physicians' experience of this unique period. Reading them at a later date may help us reflect on our planning and our approach at a time which with hindsight was the early part of the epidemic, and even before the pandemic was declared.",

At the time, I am writing this editorial, we have no idea what we should expect in the next days, weeks, or probably months. For this issue, we gathered several viewpoints from different settings to glimpse into how they are coping with this exceptional situation. By the time you read this editorial, further developments will probably make some of these thoughts obsolete. In France, hospitals and emergency departments in particular try to adapt to the ever-increasing flow of patients with suspicion of infection who constitutes serious access blocks. Our emergency medical services have a prominent role in the triage of suspected patients to limit their visits to the emergency departments. As expected, they are overwhelmed. We have few data to estimate the deadliness of this infection, but we have even less estimation of the global burden it will cause [2] . Due to overcrowded departments and wards, patients with chronic and acute disease may encounter delayed care and may suffer from resource shortage [3] . Emergency physicians are at the forefront and report from China and other regions suggests that our clinical work is about to be a lot more difficult, although it was not easy already. This surge may put emergency workers at risk: risk from a potential contamination and risk from the effect of extended shifts worked in the hospital [4] [5] [6] [7] .",
