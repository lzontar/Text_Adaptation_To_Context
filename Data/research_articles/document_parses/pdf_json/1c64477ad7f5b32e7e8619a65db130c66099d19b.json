Early detection of disinformation is extremely important to minimize the number of people influenced and hence minimize the damage. This becomes a challenge for automatic detection of disinformation as such detectors do not have access to user reactions, responses or knowledge bases for fact-checking early on, which could have been helpful for detection. However, exposing people to disinformation might help to increase the true positive rate of the disinformation detectors . Furthermore, models such as epidemiological models of disease spread (Jin, Dougherty, Saraf, Cao, & Ramakrishnan, 2013; Bettencourt, Cintr\u00f3n-Arias, Kaiser, & Castillo-Ch\u00e1vez, 2006) and diffusion models like the independent cascade model ) and the linear threshold model (Granovetter, 1978; Zafarani, Abbasi, & Liu, n.d.) , representing the propagation and spread of disinformation have also been explored to understand and potentially mitigate the spread of disinformation (Nguyen, Yan, Thai, & Eidenbenz, 2012) . However, these models can only be adequately studied after a significant amount of disinformation spread has already occurred, and therefore, this approach of detecting fake news/disinformation is not the most viable. Another challenge behind fake news detection is that some keywords and ways of expression are specific to a certain kind of event or topic. So when a fake news classifier is trained on fake vs. real articles based on a particular event or topic, the classifier ends up learning the event-specific features and thus may not perform well when applied to classify fake vs. real articles corresponding to another kind of event.

This usually means that users would be exposed to posts, articles and viewpoints that align with their own beliefs, thus reinforcing them in the process, while also remaining unaware of opposing narratives and beliefs (Pariser, 2011) . These 'echochambers' or 'filter bubbles' make the task of disinformation detection and mitigation especially difficult.

Another approach based on detecting discrepancies between real and artificially generated videos involves the analysis of 3D head pose in face videos (Yang, Li, & Lyu, 2019) . \"Facial landmarks\" were detected, which are points that map to features on the face -such as eyebrows, nose, mouth (which constitute the central part of the face), and the boundary or edge of the face. Deepfake conversion of a video usually replaces the central part of a face with that of a different face. During this conversion, there might arise some differences in alignment, which is not natural, and these result in inconsistent head poses. These fine misalignments can be difficult for a human to discern but can be learned by a model to distinguish between real and deepfake videos.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 10, "end": 34, "text": "(Li, Chang, & Lyu, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 551, "end": 574, "text": "(Yang, Li, & Lyu, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fake Videos and Deepfakes"}, {"text": "Most fake news articles and posts that are propagated online are composed of multiple types of data combined together -for example, a fabricated image along with a text related to the image.

In this work, propagation path of an article is a sequence of tuples, each tuple consisting of a timestamp t and a vector characterizing the user who shared the article at that timestamp. The propagation paths for the news articles, are fed separately into RNN and CNN units, and after subsequent pooling and concatenation operations, a classifier is trained on the learned representations in order to differentiate between fake and real articles.

Given the ever-growing relevance of disinformation on social media, and the complementary need for better detection methods and models, we hope our work would provide future researchers an idea of the advances made so far, and hence guide them towards further improvement. In this regard, we also list some of the datasets and tools used most widely in the context of disinformation detection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Future Work"}, {"text": "There are several interesting and promising directions to explore. First, threat modeling of disinformation is an exciting topic to study. Threat modeling is a widely used technique in the field of computer security to identify and combat the threat. We believe that threat modeling is a very interesting topic that was not studied to its full potential. Disinformation generators could be developed as threat models to improve our understanding of disinformation and how it spreads in society. Building threat models may help to build better disinformation detectors. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on disinformation threat modeling other than Zellers et al. (Zellers et al., 2019) . However, Zellers et al. (Zellers et al., 2019) work is limited to only textual data. As we explained previously, real-world disinformation comes in many forms, such as text, images, and videos. To build better threats models, these models need to be able to generate disinformation in as many forms as possible. Now that generating deepfakes and fake videos in general has become extremely easy, we feel there is a need for more work to be done in the detection of such fabricated videos. There is a great need for video threat modeling. One possible way to create these models is by using stock video databases available online. This method is inexpensive and quick to overwhelm detectors. Moreover, very few labeled deepfake datasets are available publicly for research. Work could be done in generating and creating more annotated deepfake datasets.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 676, "end": 698, "text": "(Zellers et al., 2019)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 725, "end": 747, "text": "(Zellers et al., 2019)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Future Work"}, {"text": "The way that social media users react to novel news content is an excellent way to detect disinformation. People tend to respond differently to disinformation and real information. However, some people are more likely to get fooled by disinformation than others. The reason behind this phenomena might be confirmation bias or some other cognitive or psychological reasons, and more research could be done to study disinformation from a psychological point of view. People who get fooled by disinformation easily could be used as an indicator of disinformation. Also, those people tend to form echo chambers, and they share disinformation among themselves. Therefore, we believe that tackling the problem of echo chambers could possibly help early detection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Future Work"}, {"text": "As we mentioned previously, the problem of early detection of fake news on social media platforms is an unsolved one and much improvements could be done in this regard.
