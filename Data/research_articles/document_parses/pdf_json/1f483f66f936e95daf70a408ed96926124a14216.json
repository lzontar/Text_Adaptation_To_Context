It quickly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by a worldwide pandemic with almost 2 million confirmed cases. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] .",

Further clinical trials and observational studies are required to clearly understand the whole spectrum of clinical presentations and the optimal diagnostic and treatment methods for COVID-19 disease in hemodialysis patients.",
