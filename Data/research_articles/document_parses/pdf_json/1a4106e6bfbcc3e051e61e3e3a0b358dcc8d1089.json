Particularly, patients with traumatic lung injury and posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have a high risk of bleeding during this procedure. This study aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of ECMO in patients with traumatic ARDS. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and investigated the clinical outcomes of ECMO in 42 patients with traumatic ARDS, among whom near-drowning (42.9%) was the most frequent cause of injury. Results: Thirty-four of 42 patients (81%) survived and were discharged after a median hospital stay of 23 days. A multivariate analysis identified a lactate level (odds ratio: 1.493, 95% confidence interval: 1.060-2.103, P = 0.022) and veno-venous (VV) ECMO (odds ratio: 0.075, 95% confidence interval: 0.006-0.901, P = 0.041) as favorable independent predictors of survival in patients with traumatic ARDS who underwent ECMO. The optimal cut off value for pre-ECMO lactate level was 10.5 mmol/L (area under the curve = 0.929, P = 0.001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the survival rate at hospital discharge was significant higher among the patients with a pre-ECMO lactate level of 10.5 mmol/L or less compared with patients with pre-ECMO lactate level greater than 10.5 mmol/L (93.8% versus 40.0%, respectively; P = 0.01).

Of the total 42, 10 received ECMO during intensive care in intensive care units (ICUs), while 32 received ECMO at emergency centers before ICU admission. The indications for veno-venous (VV) ECMO were partial arterial oxygen pressure to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (PaO2/FiO2) ratio < 100 with FiO2 of 1.0 and severe hypercapnia (pH < 7.25) with unstable hemodynamics, despite appropriate conventional ARDS treatment [6] . Venoarterial (VA) or venoarteriovenous (V-AV) ECMO was applied to patients whose ejection fractions on 2D echocardiograms were < 20% (Fig. 1) . Indications for VA ECMO included coexistent shock (i.e., systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg) with hypoxemia or hypercapnia despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. Patients predicted to require high-dose vasopressors (i.e., norepinephrine > 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/min) during VV ECMO also received V-AV ECMO (Fig. 1) . In V-AV ECMO, we inserted the additional arterial cannulae into the femoral artery and connected venous perfusion cannulae in right atrium using Y-connector.

The initial gas and blood flow rates were 4-6 and 3-5 L/min, respectively, to maintain an oxygen saturation (SaO2) > 90%. During ECMO support, heparin or nafamostat mesilate (SK Chemicals Life Science Biz., Seoul, Korea; licensed by Torii Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) was used for anticoagulation, with a target activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60-80 s [7] . Anticoagulation was usually initiated after confirmed bleeding control was achieved for 48 h in patients with a high risk of bleeding or those who underwent surgery.

Notably, survivors had a lower VIS and SAPSII (Table 1) and higher platelet count and arterial blood pH, while non-survivors had higher prolonged aPTT, INR and lactate concentration values (Table 2) . Survivors also required significantly fewer transfusions ( Table 3 ). The following complications occurred during ECMO: acute renal failure (creatinine > 2 mg/dL) in 11 (26.2%) patients, bed sores in 2 (4.8%), cholecystitis in 2 (4.8%), multi-organ failure in 2 (4.8%), central nervous system injury (hemorrhage) in 1 (2.4%), ulcer bleeding in 1 (2.4%), and leg ischemia in 1 (2.4%) patient ( Table 4 ). The investigated pre-ECMO variables were defined by considering the overlapping meaning between the variables.

ARDS remains a common post-traumatic complication and is diagnosed in 6.5% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for > 48 h [12] . If optimal ventilator strategies and adjunctive measures fail to yield improvement, ECMO might be considered to provide temporary respiratory or cardiac support in patients with cardiopulmonary failure and to allow the lungs to rest through manipulation the ventilator settings and the concentration of inspired oxygen while maintaining appropriate oxygenation, carbon dioxide removal, and tissue perfusion [13] . However, this potentially life-saving intervention is not without complications. Bleeding and thrombotic complications are the major causes of ECMO-associated morbidity and mortality [14] . The use of anticoagulant therapy is recommended to prevent thrombosis during ECMO support, however, the risk of thromboembolic complications must be balanced with the risk of bleeding. Accordingly, the use of ECMO in trauma patients is limited by the high risk of hemorrhage during and after cannulation, particularly in the presence of severe coagulopathy, contraindications to anticoagulant treatment and the risk of intracranial hemorrhage following traumatic brain injury. However, technological advances have significantly improved the characterizations of bleeding profiles. Arlt et al. [15] reported that the delayed use of heparin in 10 trauma patients did not lead to any adverse thrombotic events. Moreover, a case series described 3 cases involving delayed heparin administration due to traumatic hemorrhage and/or brain injury [16] , with times to heparinization after cannulation ranging from 24 h to 5 days. All the patients survived to discharge, and only 1 experienced a thrombotic complication (IVC clots) that was resolved by heparinization after decannulation. We administered nafamostat mesilate during ECMO support to patients with acute renal failure or at a high risk of bleeding. This synthetic serine protease inhibitor has a very short half-life and inhibits coagulation by inactivating thrombin, the activated coagulation factors XIIa and Xa, complement factors C1r and C1s, plasmin, trypsin and kallikrein 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

Ried et al. [17] evaluated 26 patients who received VV ECMO for severe traumarelated respiratory failure after mean 2.6 days of pre-ECMO ventilation and reported an 81% survival rate. Another study reported an overall survival rate of 56% among 176 patients supported with VV ECMO, and the best survival rate among trauma patients with a pre-ECMO ventilation interval of 4 days (71%, 10/14 [18] . Similarly, we calculated an overall survival rate of 81% (n = 34) in our cohort of 42 patients, 29 (69%) of whom were supported with VV ECMO. Both survivors and non-survivors received pre-ECMO ventilation for 1 day. We observed associations of the pre-ECMO VIS and SAPSII with mortality during ECMO support, consistent with our previous observation of the former as an important predictor of mortality in patients receiving ECMO support in emergency departments [6] . Therefore, we suggest that a preexisting severity scoring system may be useful for predicting mortality in trauma patients. However, the SOFA score had limited utility in our study population. Regarding survival predictors, Enger and colleagues [19] developed a new lactate-based risk score for pre-ECMO mortality and reported significantly higher values in non-survivors than in survivors.
