We also found that there are significant levels of neutralizing antibodies in recovered SARS patients 9-17 years after initial infection.

Singapore in Southeast Asia reported the highest number of 5050 confirmed cases as of 18 April 2020. Singapore also had the third highest number of confirmed SARS cases in 2003 [1, 2] . As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically closely related and belong to the same viral species, SARS related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) [3] , it is important to understand the cross reaction/neutralization dynamics in affected patients, especially in regions heavily affected by both viruses, such as Singapore. This information is important for several reasons. First, virus-specific serological tests will play an important role in retrospective contact tracing, in monitoring potential asymptomatic infections such as in children and in tracing the origin and potential intermediate host(s). Second, pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies in a given population may play a role in disease transmission and severity as antibody-dependent enhancement is known for coronaviruses including SARS-CoV [4] . Third, the possibility of using SARS convalescent human plasma for treatment of COVID-19 patients needs to be assessed urgently for nations like Singapore. Lastly, such information may also shed light on the longevity of protective immunity for SARSr-CoV in general and on the development of effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 499, "end": 502, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1163, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "For this study, convalescent sera obtained from 12 SARS survivors were used.

The complete genome sequence is deposited in GISAID under the strain name BetaCoV/Singapore/2/2020 (Accession ID EPI_ISL_406973).

Despite this genetic relatedness and the fact that both viruses use the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [3] , our data demonstrated that the level of cross-neutralization between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is limited (Table 1) . Some COVID-19 patient sera show low levels of neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV, but no neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by SARS patient sera. This is different from previous findings indicating cross-neutralization by hyperimmune horse anti-SARS-CoV serum on SARS-CoV-2 virus [3] or by SARS patient sera or rabbit hyperimmune sera on pseudovirus carrying the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 [6] . The particular horse anti-SARS-CoV hyperimmune serum used by Zhou et al. [3] was known to have a 10-fold greater neutralizing antibody level and binding to more S protein epitopes than most other human and animal sera [7] , hence not surprising to see a low level of cross-neutralization with SARS-CoV-2.

The strong crossreactivity of N-directed antibodies proved the close relatedness of the two viruses and should be taken into consideration when developing serological tests and vaccine candidates. The potential impact of existing SARS-CoV antibodies on the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection requires urgent investigation considering the high level of cross-reactive and largely nonneutralizing antibodies in SARS survivors.
