The delay in diagnosis, limited hospital resources and other treatment resources leads to rapid spread of COVID-19. In this article, we consider an optimal control COVID-19 transmission model and assess the impact of some control measures that can lead to the reduction of exposed and infectious individuals in the population. We investigate three control strategies for this deadly infectious disease using personal protection, treatment with early diagnosis, treatment with delay diagnosis and spraying of virus in the environment as time-dependent control functions in our dynamical model to curb the disease spread.",

            "text": "The understanding of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases has been well-studied and researched in mathematics and usually referred to as mathematical epidemiology. These mathematical models have played a major role in increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms which influence the spread of diseases and provide guidelines as to how the spread can be controlled [2, 7, 25] . The recent outbreak of the deadly and highly infectious COVID-19 disease has attracted the attention of many authors who have discussed and studied the nature of the virus, its transmission dynamics and the basic reproduction number of the disease, see eg. [3, 5, 9, 26, 27, 29] . Recently, Elsevier and Springer have made open access to several literature for interested researchers [4, 14] . An SEIR mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 disease with data fitting, parameter estimations and sensitivity analysis is studied in [5] whiles a deterministic model for COVID-19 that captures the effect of delay diagnosis on the disease transmission has also been presented, see [28] . In [12] , the authors explore a statistical analysis of COVID-19 disease data to estimate time-delay adjusted risk for death from this deadly virus in Wuhan, as well as for China excluding Wuhan. Their study suggested that effective social distancing and movement restrictions practices can help minimise the disease transmission. A real-time forecast phenomenological model has also been designed to study the transmission pattern of COVID-19 infectious disease, see e.g., [23] . Also, an SEIR-type compartmental modelling concept applied to design a data-driven epidemic model that incorporates governmental actions and individual behavioural reactions for the COVID-19 disease outbreak in Wuhan [11] .",

By instituting control strategies, we realise that the number of days required for the virus to be eliminated from the system is significantly reduced as compared to when there is no control strategy. The numerical illustrations also shows that by increasing \u03c6 i.e. improving the diagnostic resources, and increasing \u03b3 2 i.e. improving the diagnostic efficiency, we can control significantly the number of new confirmed cases, new infections and thus can reduce the transmission risk.
