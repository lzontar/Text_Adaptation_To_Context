A recent report in this journal by Ibrahim and colleagues describing the potential binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host 78-kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78) raised the possibility that GRP78 could be a facilitator for viral entry 1 and disruption of such interaction may be used to develop novel therapeutics specific against this virus 2 . Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in the regulation and function of GRP78, which is a stress-inducible, multi-faceted chaperone protein serving critical functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other cellular compartments, impacting both health and disease 3, 4 .",

The role of GRP78 in these studies was investigated through the use of siRNA targeting GRP78, antibody against GRP78, proteolytic cleavage of GRP78 by SubAB, as well as small molecule AR12 and natural product EGCG both of which inhibit the ATPase activity of GRP78 3,6,7 . How might GRP78, normally residing in the ER, facilitate viral attachment onto host cells? Upon ER stress, including coronavirus infection, a fraction of GRP78, an abundant ER luminal protein, is actively translocated from the ER to the cell surface and assume new functions, including viral entry 3,4,6,8 ( Figure 1 ). In the case of MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU9 coronaviruses, their spike proteins bind to cell surface GRP78 (csGRP78) in addition to their cognate receptors 6 . Thus, csGRP78 may enhance viral entry by stabilizing the interaction between host and viral factors required for viral entry, which is consistent with our recent observations that csGRP78 can interact with and stabilize cell surface receptors such as CD44 and CD109 8, 9 . Furthermore, in cell types where the primary viral receptor expression is low, csGRP78 may serve as an alternative host factor for viral entry.",

Unlike cellular protein synthesis, which is tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis, viruses, such as coronavirus, can selectively shut down host protein production and usurp the host ER translational machinery to synthesize the viral proteins in massive quantities. This results in ER overload, leading to ER stress and UPR activation. Consequently, ER stress and GRP78 upregulation have been reported during infection by a wide variety of viruses [5] [6] [7] . In addition to its role in viral protein folding, GRP78 upregulation during viral replication could protect the virus-infected host cells from undergoing apoptosis since GRP78 is known to bind and maintain the ER-associated apoptotic machineries in their inactive forms and exert pro-survival effects especially under ER stress 3 . These features make the ER a particularly important cellular compartment for viral production and viruses have evolved complex mechanisms to exploit and manipulate the ER to enhance their replication. Conversely, the dependence of viruses on the ER and its key resident chaperone GRP78 for viral protein production and host cell survival could be the virus' Achilles heel and offers a unique opportunity for combating SARS-CoV-2 and other virus infections.",

Firstly, GRP78 depletion during viral replication could lead to reduced synthesis or improper folding of viral proteins resulting in impaired budding or immature virions with diminished infectivity. Secondly, GRP78 could facilitate the assembly of various viral components by maintaining ER homeostasis and thus provide a conducive environment for virus maturation. Lastly, GRP78 could be captured into the viral particles and enhances subsequent cellular infection. Indeed, it has been reported that GRP78 was found in Japanese encephalitis virus particles and mature virions that lacked GRP78 displayed significant decrease in viral infectivity 10 . It will be interesting to determine the topology of GRP78 in these virions and the generality of this interesting and surprising observation.",

            "text": "Potential roles of GRP78 in the viral infection cycle. Virus life cycle consists of three essential stages: (1) viral attachment and entry, (2) viral protein production and (3) viral release and re-infectivity. GRP78 potentially plays important roles in all three stages. During viral attachment and entry, cell surface GRP78 may stabilize the interaction between the viral spike protein and the cellular host receptor to facilitate entry or serve as alternative host factor for viral entry. During active viral replication and protein production, ER-localized GRP78 aids in the proper folding and processing of viral proteins as well as maintaining ER homeostasis, providing a conducive cellular environment for viral assembly and maturation. ER stress induced by viral infection could also drive cell surface GRP78 translocation, further promoting viral entry. During final viral assembly and budding from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), GRP78 may be associated with the viral particles and released together with mature virions to enhance their infectivity as an accessory host factor. Table 1. Effects of anti-GRP78 agents in the viral life cycle. Anti-GRP78 agents have been shown to interfere with entry and production of a wide range of viruses spanning many different virus families. Examples in each virus family are shown and the anti-GRP78 agents used in the published studies were as follows: (a) siRNA against GRP78; (b) antibody against GRP78; (c) proteolytic cleavage of GRP78 by subtilase cytoxin (SubAB); (d) small molecule AR12; and (e) natural product epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).",
