            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has urged the development and implementation of guidelines and protocols on diagnosis, management, infection control strategies, and discharge planning. However, very little is currently known about neonatal COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Thus, many questions arise with regard to respiratory care after birth, necessary protection to health care workers (HCW) in the delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and safety of bag and mask ventilation, noninvasive respiratory support, deep suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Indeed, these questions have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW. In this manuscript, we comprehensively reviewed the current evidence regarding COVID-19 perinatal transmission, respiratory outcomes of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 and infants with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the evidence for using different respiratory support modalities and aerosol-generating procedures in this specific population. The results demonstrated that to date, neonatal COVID-19 infection is uncommon, generally acquired postnatally, and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes. The reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease remains unclear. Nonetheless, the risk of severe or critical illness in young patients exists. Currently, the recommended respiratory approach for infants with suspected or confirmed infection is not evidence based but should include all routinely used types of support, with the addition of viral filters, proper personal protective equipment, and placement of infants in isolation rooms, ideally with negative pressure. As information is changing rapidly, clinicians should frequently watch out for updates on the subject.",

In response to the pandemic, hospitals have quickly ramped up efforts to develop and implement guidelines and protocols. These contingency plans have focused on diagnosis, treatment, discharge, and infection control strategies, but preparation and dissemination have been challenged due to paucity of high-quality evidence, rapid pace of new information, and conflicting data. Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have been relatively spared so far, and thus very little is currently known about neonatal severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Many questions pertaining to the newborn population have arisen, particularly with regard to their respiratory care. What are the chances of vertical transmission of the virus and how should the infant be managed during the immediate postpartum period? What is the optimal management of a preterm infant born to a SARS-CoV-2 positive mother requiring respiratory support immediately after birth? How should HCW protect themselves? What is the optimal approach for managing an extremely preterm infant already on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) that develops signs and symptoms suspicious for COVID-19? Can this patient still be safely managed with noninvasive support? If the patient deteriorates, are procedures, such as mask ventilation or deep suctioning, safe or should the infant be immediately intubated? Altogether, these scenarios have created tremendous confusion amongst neonatal HCW (\u25baFig. 1). These anxieties have been exacerbated further by an inability to simply extrapolate current adult recommendations to neonates, given their remarkably different respiratory physiology and the course itself of COVID-19 disease.",

Only four infants required respiratory support after birth, 5, 7, 9, 25 of which one required mechanical ventilation (MV) on day 3 of life for frequent desaturations. 17 An additional infant required MV on day 8 of life in the context of shock, multiorgan failure, and subsequent death (negative test at the time of clinical deterioration). 25 Also, there was one reported case of stillbirth attributable to maternal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock. 17 Three infants had equivocal test results for SARS-CoV-2 despite having an otherwise uneventful postnatal course. 22, 26 All tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) taken from the infants' nasopharyngeal swabs and serum as well as the maternal vaginal secretions and breask milk. However, they had elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin IgG and IgM antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 after birth. While the presence of IgM antibodies at high levels in the newborn raises the possibility of maternal-infant transmission, the negative RT-PCR results are harder to explain. Moreover, caution is advised when using IgM assays to make the diagnosis of congenital infections since false positives are not uncommon. 28 Only four infants born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection had a positive test. 23, 27 However, given that all four infants were only diagnosed between 36 to 48 hours after birth (RT-PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs), it is impossible to determine whether these infections were acquired in utero or postnatally. Moreover, although strict infectious control measures were reportedly implemented in those four infants, there was insufficient information regarding contact with the mother (or any other family members) and exposure to breastmilk. In the first case, a term infant born by normal delivery to a mother with confirmed COVID-19 had a benign postnatal course except for mild lymphopenia and mildly elevated liver enzymes. 27 Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive at 36 hours of life but no respiratory support was needed throughout hospitalization. Importantly, RT-PCR tests performed on placental tissue, umbilical cord blood, and breast milk were all negative. In the second and third cases, 23 two term infants with unremarkable delivery developed fever and lethargy on the second day of life and their RT-PCR was positive at approximately 48 hours after birth. Both infants rapidly improved and did not require respiratory support. In the last case, 23 a preterm infant (31 2/7 weeks' gestation) born by caesarean section for fetal distress had low Apgar's scores, developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring noninvasive support, and later developed 22 Chen Y et al, 3 Li et al, 12 Wang et al, 27 Wu et al, 19 All in all, infants born to mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection generally have favorable outcomes, with no convincing case of vertical transmission, at least when delivery route was caesarean section. In the few cases where infants had a positive or equivocal test, postnatal course was generally uneventful.",

We identified 18 publications that described the clinical manifestations and outcomes from a total of 856 neonates and infants under 1 year with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9,15,31-46 All but three were case reports or case series that included fewer than 10 infants <1 year. Of the 48 infants described in these reports, all were either asymptomatic, had mild fever and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, or mild pneumonia. Only four infants required oxygen supplementation, and none needed additional respiratory support or intensive care. Furthermore, only nine infants were described to have acquired the infection during the neonatal period, 9, 37, 44, 45 and all were either asymptomatic carriers or had mild respiratory symptoms. In the third largest publication, Lu et al described the evolution of 31 infants between the ages of 0 to 1 year with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 40 The majority (80%) presented with pneumonia but did not require any respiratory support. Of note, one infant died from multiorgan failure due to an intussusception. In the most recent CDC report, among 95 infants <1 year with known hospitalization status, 59 (62%) required hospitalization, but only 5 were in intensive care. 31 In the largest pediatric cohort study to date, Dong et al described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 2,143 children from China with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, among which 379 (18%) were infants under 1 year. 35 In the latter group, 33 developed severe pneumonia with hypoxemia (requiring respiratory support) and 7 were in critical condition (developed ARDS and shock) but eventually recovered. While this study suggests that close to 10% of infants with ages 0-to 1-year age develop severe or critical illness, it is important to note that only 86/379 infants actually had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (by RT-PCR or through genomic sequencing). The other 293 infants were suspected cases based on fulfilling clinical, laboratory, or radiological criteria. Considering that the proportion of severe/critical presentations in the study were significantly higher in the suspected, compared with the confirmed COVID-19 cases, this raises the possibility that many of the suspected cases may have been caused by viral pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. Thus, although the majority of neonates and infants under 1 year with SARS-CoV-2 infection appear to have generally favorable outcomes, the risk of severe or critical illness exists. Intriguingly, the reason why infants display a milder spectrum of disease compared with adults remains unclear and is the subject of ongoing investigations. 47, 48 Terminology The provision of respiratory care remains an integral component of the management of neonates, whether during the transition period after birth or during NICU hospitalization. Respiratory support practices should follow an evidencebased approach for treating patients and protecting HCW from the virus. An important first step is to define neonatal ARDS in the context of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Is there a specific clinical feature attributable to COVID-19 when dealing with neonatal respiratory distress? In 2017, an international multicenter collaborative produced a consensus definition for neonatal ARDS. 49 This definition might help to standardize the processes for identifying suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and classifying them according to their illness severity. Moreover, as the number of deaths in neonates positive for SARS-CoV-2 may become increasingly reported, this definition will help to differentiate between deaths attributable to pregnancy complications (e.g., prematurity and asphyxia) and deaths attributable to the infection itself.",

In 2014, the WHO systematically reviewed and graded the evidence for using different protective measures during AGPs.

In a systematic review, manual ventilation (before or after intubation) was not independently associated with increased risk of viral transmission 53 and the odds of acquiring a viral infection were three times higher during endotracheal intubation compared with bagging. 54 In a series of physiological experiments, Chan et al programmed an adult simulator to mimic varying severities of lung injury. 55,56 When a tidal volume (VT) of 300 mL was applied, air dispersion reached up to 0.3 to 0.35 m. Presumably, lower VT would produce less air dispersion. Indeed, in another experiment using noninvasive ventilation, a five-fold decrease in VT was associated with a 30% reduction in air dispersion. 57 Thus, using this nonlinear relationship, mask and bag ventilation of a neonate weighing 3 kg using VT between 15 to 18 mL (16-20 times lower than adults) would generate a small air dispersion of approximately 1.5 to 1.8 cm (\u25baFig. 3). Technical skills to minimize exhaled air dispersion is also paramount since inexperienced HCW can increase the spread by 40%. 55 Thus, in neonatal respiratory care, avoidance of manual ventilation solely for the purpose of preventing air dispersion appears unnecessary.",

However, during the SARS outbreak, many adult patients were safely and effectively treated with both therapies in hospitals with good infection control measures (proper room air exchange rate and adequate PPE). 54,57, 58 Simonds et al evaluated air dispersion during NIPPV and found generation of droplets of >10 \u03bcm in size, 59 suggesting that most droplets deposit on local surfaces within a short distance. While this reduces the risk of viral acquisition by inhalation, these surfaces may serve as a source of infection in the absence of strict precautions. In another experiment in adults, exposure to exhaled air occurred within a 1-m region (0.3-0.85 m) when using three different types of interfaces and VT of 300 mL (16-20 times the VT of a 3-kg infant). 60 Therefore, CPAP and NIPPV appear to be safe in neonates if used in adequately ventilated room, with proper protection measures, careful fitting of the interface, and addition of hydrophobic filter between the interface and water reservoir (bubble CPAP) or exhalation port of ventilators (CPAP or NIPPV).

Thus, because of the potential risk of transmission, endotracheal intubation should be performed by skilled providers using full PPE. An appropriately sized ET should be used to avoid excessive leak.

Neonates are usually intubated with uncuffed ET due to risks of upper airway injury. This may lead to leaks around the tube and create aerosol dispersion. However, due to the small VT used, the magnitude of dispersion is likely minor (\u25baFig. 3). Also, a closed ET suction circuit should be used, and a hydrophobic filter placed at the exhalation port (never between the circuit adapter and ET). There are no clear data to support any specific mode of ventilation to treat viral pneumonia/ARDS in neonates or decrease aerosol dispersion. High-frequency ventilation seems to be safe as investigated in one adult study. 54 However, it should be noted that while with conventional and highfrequency jet ventilation exhaled gases exit via the expiratory limb and therefore can be captured by a filter, during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation with the SensorMedics 3100A or B, the exhaled gases are exhausted directly into the ambient air.",

Moreover, neonatal COVID-19 appears to be acquired postnatally and associated with favorable respiratory outcomes. For those reasons, provision of respiratory care in newborn infants should continue in accordance with current standards and major practice changes should be avoided to minimize harm. However, to protect HCW from suspected or confirmed cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is critical to consistently implement safe respiratory practices including proper patient isolation, optimal PPE, and the use of viral filters to the expiratory limbs of any respiratory device. Lastly, information is changing rapidly, and clinicians should watch frequently for updates as the state of knowledge evolves.",
