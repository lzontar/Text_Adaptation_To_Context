Recent advances in molecular and genomic profiling have provided unprecedented insight into disease pathogenesis driven by distinct cells of origins and molecular pathways. The discovery and clinical application of molecular biomarkers in PTCL subtypes has the potential to transform personalized care for patients with PTCL in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Targeting CD30+ PTCL with the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin in the relapsed setting and in combination with chemotherapy in the frontline setting has improved patient survivals. Epigenetic modifying agents, including HDAC inhibitors and hypomethylating agents, have demonstrated broad clinical efficacy and durability and are in clinical development for combination strategies for both relapsed and frontline settings. Wideranging novel agents targeting critical intracellular pathways and tumor microenvironment are in active exploration to define clinical activities. This review summarizes PTCL-specific biomarkers which are increasingly incorporated in clinical practice to guide precision diagnosis and personalized treatment.",

Despite divergent cells of origin and mechanisms of lymphomagenesis, management of PTCL has historically followed the treatment framework for aggressive B cell NHL, in part due to lack of understanding of subtype-specific disease pathogenesis, as well as difficulty of conducting dedicated prospective treatment studies. Although generally not curative with the exception of ALK+ ALCL, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) is the most commonly prescribed initial treatment for systemic PTCL. While autologous stem cell transplant may extend progression-free survival (PFS) for some patients, relapse remains common. Recent advances in the molecular and genetic bases of PTCL biology, as well as emergence of targeted therapeutic agents, have made it possible to envision personalized therapeutic progress.",

T cell-associated antigens such as CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7 are variably expressed; one or more antigens such as CD5 or CD7 are frequently lost. Tumor cells can express either CD4 or CD8, with the majority expressing CD4. Clonal T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements are usually detected and mostly show alpha/beta T cell receptors (TCR beta positive). Gene expression profiles (GEPs) have identified two subgroups of PTCL, NOS, with distinct gene expression driven by the transcription factors TBX-21 or GATA-3, which promote differentiation of CD4+ T cells into TH1 and TH2 helper cells, respectively. The GATA3 subgroup was significantly associated with poor survival outcome [3, 4] .",

There are three distinct forms of sALCL, including ALK-positive ALCL which has a peak incidence in children and young adults and is associated with translocations involving ALK gene located on chromosome 2p23, ALK-negative ALCL that typically presents in older adults, and the breast implantassociated ALK-negative sALCL. The immunophenotype of ALCL is notable for universal expression of CD30, frequent expression of TIA1, granzyme B, perforin, EMA, and low expression of CD8 and CD56. The majority of ALCL have clonally rearranged TCR genes, while roughly 10% in the null group have no rearrangement of TCR. Cytogenetic studies play a key role in ALCL diagnosis. ALK-positive ALCL most frequently has t(2;5) which fuses nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5q35 with the ALK gene on chromosome 2p23. NPM-ALK is an oncogenic tyrosine kinase which promotes signaling of JAK/STAT pathway. Less frequent variant ALK rearrangements include t(1;2) and t(2;3). In ALK-negative ALCL, recurrent chromosomal rearrangements involving the DUSP22-IRF4 locus on 6p25.3 were associated with favorable outcomes, while those involving TP53 homolog TP63 on 3q28 were associated with aggressive clinical behavior and poor outcomes [6] . Gene expression signatures of ALCL showed hyper-activation of STAT3 due to rearrangements of ALK tyrosine kinase or activating mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway.",

AITL is one of the more common PTCLs encountered in Western countries, accounting for~28% PTCL in Europe, with lower incidence in North America and Asia (~15%) [7] . Patients typically present with advanced-stage disease and symptoms of a systemic illness such as rash, fever, and malaise. AITL can also manifest with immunologic abnormalities such as polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia or autoimmune cytopenias. The histology of AITL is characterized by a polymorphous infiltrate of immune cells with a prominent proliferation of high endothelial venules. The tumor cells express follicular T helper cell markers including CD10, CXCL13, PD-1, BCL6, and ICOS. Molecular studies show that T cell receptor genes are rearranged in 75 to 90% of cases, while immunoglobulin heavy chains may be rearranged in up to 25% due to expansion of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated immunoblastic B cell clones. Gene expression profiling demonstrates a molecular signature typical of follicular helper T cell origin [8, 9] , with recurrent driver mutations in TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, and RHOA, which are implicated in epigenetic regulation.",

It is a member of the extended CD28/CTLA-4 family of immune checkpoint that guards against autoimmunity by downregulating the immune system and promoting self-tolerance [40] . PD-1 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells, B cells, and macrophages and negatively regulates immune responses broadly. PD1 binds two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In PTCL, PD-1 expression was detected in atypical T lymphoma cells in the majority of AITL (> 90%), to a lesser extent in PTCL/NOS (30-60%), and rarely in other subtypes [41] . In AITL, both PD1 and CXCL13, a chemokine promoting B cell migration and survival in lymph node, showed a similar expression frequency highlighting follicular helper T cells (TFH) [42] , which may share additional TFH markers including CD10, BCL6, and ICOS [43] . In NKTCL, PD-L1 expression in NK/T cell lymphoma cells ranged from 56 to 93% in various studies, while PD-1 level was low [44] . In ATLL, PD-L1 amplification was shown as a strong genetic predictor in both aggressive and indolent ATLL [45] . Anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade strategy has generated mixed results in PTCL to date due to the complexity that malignant T cell lymphoma cells can express PD-1. In such instances, immune checkpoint blockade has the potential to accelerate tumor growth in tumor cells with high PD-1 expression, as proposed in murine studies [46] . ATLL patients treated with nivolumab developed rapid disease progression after 1 cycle of nivolumab treatment [47] , cautioning against the use of immune checkpoint blockade in ATLL without further understanding the complex mechanism of immune evasion and activation. In other subtypes, responses have been mixed. In patients with R/R T cell lymphoma, singleagent nivolumab produced ORR of 40% [48] , while PD1 blockade with pembrolizumab showed high efficacy (100% ORR, 71% CR) in a case series of 7 R/R EBV-associated NK and T cell lymphoma [49] . A phase II multicenter trial of patients with R/R PTCL who were treated with pembrolizumab was halted early after a preplanned interim futility analysis [49] . Nevertheless, several trials are ongoing to further explore the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in PTCL. Pembrolizumab is being added to romidepsin (NCT03278 782) and pralatrexate (NCT03598998) in ongoing phase I/ II trials in patients with R/R PTCL. Pembrolizumab is also being combined with pralatrexate and the epigenic modifier decitabine in an ongoing phase I trial (NCT03240211). The PD-1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab is being studied alone and in combination with lenalidomide in patients with R/R PTCL and CTCL (NCT03011814) as well as in combination with pralatrexate, romidepsin, and/or azacitdine (NCT03161223). The novel PD-1 monoclonal antibodies avelumab (NCT03046953) and tislelizumab (NCT03493451) are being evaluated in R/R PTCL and R/R mature NK and T cell lymphomas, respectively.",

Specifically, inhibition of PI3K-\u03b4 and PI3K-\u03b3 isoforms blocks mitogenic and survival within tumor cells, disrupts interaction with the tumor microenvironment, and restores antitumor immune responses. The PI3K \u03b4/\u03b3 inhibitor duvelisib was evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation trial in 16 patients with R/R PTCL at a MTD of 75 mg twice daily on a 28-day cycle where it resulted in a 50% ORR with 3 CRs. The median PFS was 8.3 months, with activity demonstrated across a number of subtypes [56] , and a phase II trial is underway (NCT03372057). Duvelasib is also being studied in combination with romidepsin and bortezomib in a parallel phase I study in patients with PTCL and CTCL. Duvelasib is given at 75 mg twice daily on days 1-28 on 28-day cycles with either romidepsin 10 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, and 15 (arm A) or with bortezomib 1 mg/m 2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 (arm B) [56, 57] . These combinations show activity with ORR and CR rates of 55% and 27% for patients with PTCL treated on arm A, and 36% and 21%, respectively, in patients treated on arm B. The median PFS and OS were 8.8 months and 9.1 months for PTCL patients on arm A and 3.5 months and 9.3 months for patients on arm B. Of note, 65% of patients treated on arm A experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) with neutropenia (18%) and elevated transaminases (15%) being the most frequent. Among patients treated on arm B, 45% experienced grade 3 or higher AEs with neutropenia (18%) occurring in more than 10% of patients. A phase IB dose-escalation study is being planned to examine the combination of romidepsin with the PI3K \u03b1/\u03b4 inhibitor copanlisib (NCT04233697).

There is a paucity of prospective randomized trials comparing alternative chemotherapy combinations with CHOP in frontline setting, given disease rarity and heterogeneity. The German High-Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group, in a retrospective ad hoc analysis of over 300 patients with PTCL, showed that the addition of etoposide to CHOP (CHOEP) improved the EFS of patients younger than 60 who had ALCL and normal LDH levels. Other subgroups of patients did not appear to significantly benefit from this addition [67] . To date, standard-dose CHOP remains the reference regimen in PTCL treatment. Efforts to improve frontline therapy in PTCL have been focused on several strategies: (1) to improve upon CHOP by incorporating novel agent X into CHOP chemotherapy backbone, whereas X denotes therapeutic targeting of surface biomarkers such as CD30 and CD52, or epigenetic modifiers regulating essential pathogenic pathways involving modification of histone acetylation and methylation; (2) to explore novel combination free of conventional chemotherapy; and (3) to experiment with novel agents for consolidation and maintenance following chemotherapy induction.",

Durable remission at 5 years was noted in 50% of patients without subsequent anti-cancer therapy [69] . Based on this encouraging phase 1 data, a global double-blind, randomized phase 3 study (ECHELON-2, NCT01777152) was initiated in 2013 comparing BV-CHP with standard CHOP in untreated CD30-positive PTCL (targeting 75% ALCL) [70] , and randomized 452 patients. BV-CHP was associated with higher CR rate (68% vs 56%, p = 0.0066) and superior survival. Median PFS was 48.2 months in the BV-CHP group, significantly improved compared to 20.8 months in the CHOP group. In addition, BV-CHP reduced the risk of death by 34% compared with CHOP. Adverse events, including febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy, were similar between groups. ECHELON-2 is the first randomized phase 3 study establishing the superiority of BV-CHP over CHOP in untreated PTCL, which led to FDA approval in November 2018 of BV-CHP as frontline therapy for CD30-positive PTCL. Although the ECHELON-2 study included non-ALCL cases such as PTCL-NOS, AITL, ATLL, and EATL (~30% enrollment, 136 total), their small sample sizes precluded sufficient power analysis.",

The EZH1/2 inhibitor DS-3201b has demonstrated in vitro anti-tumor activity in lymphoma cell lines and is being investigated in a phase I trial of patients with R/R PTCL (NCT02732275). The IDH2 inhibitor AG-221 is being studied in patients with advanced solid tumors or gliomas or R/R AITL who harbor these mutations (NCT02273739). An ongoing phase II trial is being conducted to explore the efficacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in patients with R/R lymphoma, including PTCL (NCT01431209). Alternative JAK inhibitors are also being investigated including AZD4205 (NCT04105010). The dual SYK/JAK inhibitor cerdulatinib is under evaluation in a phase I/II trial in patients with R/R CLL or NHL, including PTCL (NCT01994382). The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has been approved for use in B cell lymphoma such as CLL and is now being investigated in an ongoing phase II trial in patients with BCL-2-positive TCL, including AITL and TFH origin PTCL (NCT03552692). Tipifarnib, a potent and selective inhibitor of farnesyltransferase, has been shown to modulate CXCL12 signaling pathway and has demonstrated promising preliminary results in patients with R/R AITL and CXCL12+ PTCL with ORR of 45% and a 73% clinical benefit rate [83] in a phase II trial in patients with R/R PTCL (NCT02464228). Engaging the tumor microenvironment remains an attractive approach in PTCL, and various novel strategies are under investigation. ICOS, an important member of the CD28/CTLA-4 family found on TFH cells, is being targeted with the monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 in an ongoing phase I trial in patients with PTCL follicular variant and AITL (NCT02520791). CD38 expression has been demonstrated in up to half of ENKTL [84] , and the CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab has shown promising ORR of 35.7% in this population [85] .

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells directed against CD30 have been developed and are being explored in a phase II trial (NCT04083495) in patients with R/R CD30+ PTCL. AMF13, a bispecific antibody containing a binding site for CD30 and a second binding site for CD16A, the receptor responsible for NK cell activation, is being evaluated in R/ R CTCL (NCT04101331). This molecule is also under clinical investigation in combination with NK cells in patients with R/R CD30+ lymphomas (NCT04074746). The T cell receptor \u03b2-chain (TCRB) is a pan-T cell antigen highly expressed on PTCL. CAR-T cells targeting TRBC1 are being studied in patients with TRBC1+ selected R/R PTCL (NCT03590574).",
