To this end, fertilized oocytes and morulae were exposed to different concentrations of MMVp for 16 h, while 2-cell embryos and blastocysts were coincubated for 1 h. In addition, morulae were exposed to MHV-A59 for 16 h. One group of embryos was washed, and the remaining embryos remained unwashed before embryo transfer. Serological analyses were performed by means of ELISA to detect antibodies to MHV or MMV in recipients and in progeny on Days 14, 21, 28, 42, and 63 and on Days 42, 63, 84, 112, 133, and 154, respectively, after embryo transfer. Coincubation with a minimum of 10 5 /ml of fluorescent microspheres showed that particles with a diameter of 20 nm but not 100 nm crossed the ZP of murine blastocysts. Washing generally led to a 10-fold to 100-fold reduction of MMVp. Washed MMV-exposed but not MHV-exposed embryos led to the production of antibodies independent of embryonic stage and time of virus exposure. Recipients receiving embryos exposed to a minimum of 10 7 mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/ml of MHV-A59 and 10 2 TCID 50 /ml of MMVp seroconverted by Day 42 after embryo transfer.

Sendai virus adhered to the murine ZP even after 12 washings with trypsin [58] . In the present study, whether MMV was in or within the ZP was not investigated in detail. However, serological and PCR data showed that embryos served as vectors for MMVp, suggesting that penetration of the ZP by MMVp should not be excluded. This could be the reason why, in some cases, MMVp was no longer detected in the washing drops but led to seroconversion of recipients. Another plausible reason is that MMV may get deeply lodged in the micropores of the ZP and cannot be removed even by frequent washings. Further studies are underway to determine if MMVp was in the ZP or if this virus had penetrated the ZP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 92, "end": 96, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 97, "end": 101, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 102, "end": 106, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 168, "end": 172, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 173, "end": 177, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 178, "end": 182, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 318, "end": 322, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 357, "end": 361, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 362, "end": 366, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 367, "end": 371, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 384, "end": 388, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 554, "end": 558, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 620, "end": 624, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 625, "end": 628, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 674, "end": 678, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 755, "end": 759, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "194"}, {"text": "From the present results, we conclude that embryo transfer is an adequate tool for the elimination of viruses, provided that they do not adhere to or penetrate the ZP, enabling removal by washing to a noninfectious dose.
