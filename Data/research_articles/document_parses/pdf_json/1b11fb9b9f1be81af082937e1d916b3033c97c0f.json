Serum IgG are highly fucosylated at birth and slightly decrease to ~94% fucosylation at 52 adulthood (9). Until now, no strong clues on how IgG core fucosylation is controlled have 53 come forward. 54 We have previously observed that alloantibodies against red blood cells (RBC) and platelets 55 show remarkably low IgG-Fc-fucosylation in most patients, even down to 10% in several 56 cases (10-12), whereas the overall serum IgG Fc-fucosylation show consistently normal high 57 levels. Moreover, we have reported the lowered IgG-Fc fucosylation to be one of the factors 58 determining disease severity in pregnancy associated alloimmunizations, resulting in 59 excessive thrombocytopenia's and blood cell destruction when targeted by afucosylated 60 antibodies (11-13). In addition to the specific afucosylated-IgG response against platelets 61 and RBC antigens, this response has also been identified against HIV and Dengue virus (14, 62 Inspired by the similarities between the unique afucosylated IgG responses in various 68 alloimmune responses (10-12, 18), HIV (15) and Dengue(14) -all being directed against 69 surface exposed and membrane embedded proteins -we analyzed IgG glycosylation in anti- To investigate the Fc-glycosylation of total-and antigen-specific antibodies, first IgG from 76 >400 human serum samples was affinity-purified using protein G affinity beads and 77 immobilized antigens, respectively.

The finding that HBsAg-specific antibodies in individuals 137 that cleared a natural infection showed lowered Fc-fucosylation compared to protein subunit 138 vaccination strongly suggests that a specific context for the antigenic stimulus is required for 139 afucosylated-IgG responses. We then compared antiviral-IgG responses against Mumps-and Measle viruses-formed after 141 a natural infection or vaccination with live attenuated viruses.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are highly diverse, ranging from asymptomatic or mild self-148 limiting infection to a severe airway inflammation leading to respiratory distress, often with a 149 fatal outcome(20, 21). Both extreme trajectories, follow similar initial responses: patients150    have approximately a week of relatively mild symptoms, followed by a second wave that 151 either clears the disease or leads to a highly-aggravated life-threatening phenotype (20, 21).152    Both the timing of either response type and the differential clinical outcome suggests153 different paths taken by the immune system to combat the disease. So far no clear evidence 154 has emerged that can make a distinction between these two hypothetical immunological 155 paths. In accordance with our theory and responses seen in other enveloped viruses, anti-S 156 IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), expressed on cell surface/viral envelope, 157 were strongly skewed towards low core fucosylation, while those against the nucleocapsid 158 protein (N), not expressed on cell surface/viral envelope, was characterized with high level 159 of fucose. Importantly, the afucosylated anti-S IgG-responses of patients with Acute 160 Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) hospitalized in intensive care units were significantly 161 lower than in convalescent plasma donors consisting of individuals who were asymptomatic 162 or had relative mild symptoms (non-ARDS) (Fig. 3A). Fucosylation levels of anti-S IgG1, but not anti-N, are significantly decreased in 165 critically ill COVID-19 patients . A) Fucosylation was significantly lowered for ARDS patients 166 for anti-S, but not in non-ARDS donors naturally clearing the infection. Anti-N responses were 167 similar to total IgG. B) Galactosylation, was increased for both anti-N and anti-S in non-ARDS 168 donors as well as ARDS patients C) Sialylation shows similar pattens as galactosylation, and 169 D) Bisection was very low for both anti-N and anti-S in both patient groups. Statistical 170 analysis was performed as a one-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test, 171comparing total IgG to antigen-specific IgG within groups, and same specificity IgG between 172 groups. Only statistically significant differences are shown. lowered fucosylation of the anti-S was not a general issue of the inflammation as total175    IgG-fucosylation levels were similar in the two groups and to what has been reported in the general population (~94%)(11, 16). In addition, IgG galactosylation of both anti-S and anti-N 177 responses tended to be higher than seen in total IgG, compatible with increased 178 galactosylation observed in active or recent immunization(16, 22). However, IgG 179 galactosylation levels in general were lower in the ARDS patients, perhaps suggesting lower 180 capacity to clear the infection by reduced complement activity (23). This may be a reflection 181 of a slight age difference in these two groups (non-ARDS donors median 53\u00b112, 182 ARDS patients 61\u00b17.9), as galactose generally decreases slightly with advancing age(9, 19).183    More importantly, the lowered fucosylation in the anti-S responses of the ARDS patients,184 strongly suggest a pathological role through Fc\u03b3RIIIa, similar to what was previously 185 proposed for Dengue (14). In Dengue, non-neutralizing antibodies formed to previous 186 infections of other Dengue serotypes, also tend to have low level of core-fucosylated IgG 187 and, as they are not capable of preventing infection, leading to aggravated Dengue-disease 188 due to Fc\u03b3RIIIa-mediated overreactions by immune cells (14).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF11": {"text": ", our results show a pattern of afucosylated IgG1 immune responses against 191 membrane-embedded antigens such as surface membrane proteins of allo-antigens on blood 192 cells or on enveloped viruses, in contrast to soluble protein antigens and non-enveloped 193 viruses for which immune responses with high levels of IgG1 fucosylation are consistently 194 observed. We hypothesize that antigen-presenting membranes are directly sensed by B cells 195 combining at least two signals provided by the B cell receptor and a yet unknown host 196 receptor-ligand pair, not occurring for soluble proteins, internal protein of enveloped viruses 197", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF12": {"text": "Hypothetical model explaining how the context of antigen can lead to altered im-200 mune signaling, giving rise to altered IgG-glycosylation A) Immune response to soluble pro-201 tein antigen: B-cell receptor (BCR, a membrane immunoglobulin) is activated, resulting in the 202 production of normal fucosylated antibodies.

The proposed sig-208 naling in b-c) causes altered glyco-programming of the B cells culminating in a unique IgG-209 response characterized by a low fucosylation (fucose red triangle) and enhanced ADCC. The 210 model potentially explains both why immune response to soluble proteins, non-enveloped 211 viruses and cellular pathogens such as bacteria is different to responses to enveloped-viruses 212 and why immune responses to allo-antigens mimic that of an enveloped viral infection. 213 214 Alternatively, the differential recognition may be more complex and require additional 215 interactions from antigen-presenting cells, T cells and/or cytokines. Importantly, our studies 216 imply that a membrane context may be necessary but not always sufficient to trigger an 217 immune response with high levels of afucosylated IgG. (18). This translates into a vast spread 218 of afucosylation levels between individuals as well as for distinct responses of the same 219 individual against different antigens. The large difference in the level of antigen-specific 220 afucosylated responses observed between patients contributes to the variability of disease 221 severity, as has been shown for the neonatal alloimmune cytopenias (11, 12, 18), Dengue 222 (14) and now also for COVID-19. This underscores the significance for diagnosis of possible Importantly, when IgG afucosylation does occur, the final outcome, results in a potent 225 immune response, honed for destruction of targets cells by Fc\u03b3RIIIa-expressing NK cells, 226 monocytes and macrophages but also Fc\u03b3RIIIb-expressing granulocytes. This can be desired 227 in some responses such as against HIV (15), which can be achieved with available attenuated 228 enveloped viral vaccine shuttles (24) against difficult targets. On the other hand, this can also 229 lead to an undesired exaggerated response, as is apparent for both Dengue (14) and COVID-230 19. This is exemplified in experiments in monkeys, where vaccination with Modified Vaccinia 231 Ankara virus ferrying spike proteins of SARS-CoV lead to strong ADE response (25) mimicking 232 pathologies in critically ill SARS-CoV2 patients (21). This suggests that a subunit protein 233 vaccine to be a safer option as seen in rat models for SARS-CoV2 (26), unless the vaccine also 234 induces a strong neutralizing effect. 235 For COVID-19, the data suggest that afucosylation of anti-S IgG may contribute to the 236 exacerbation of the disease in an subset of patient ending up in Intensive care units with 237 ARDS. Thus although they can be protective, they might potentially behave as double-edged 238 swords, and may contribute to the observed cytokine storm (27). As such this has direct 239 consequences for improving current therapies with IVIg, convalescent plasma and the route 240 taken towards vaccine development. In addition, the suggested role of afucosylated 241 antibodies in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 might open new opportunities for therapy of this 242 disease. Future attempts of generating high-titer COVID-19 immunoglobulin treatments, 243 should preferably use plasma enriched in fucosylated anti-COVID-19 antibodies. These may 244 outcompete afucosylated anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG-responses developing in the patients to avoid 245 symptom escalation and promote virus neutralization. donor samples from Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, were used to 250 analyze ParvoB19 (n=22), Measle virus (n=21 natural infection, n=24 Live Attenuated 251 vaccine), Mump virus (n=21 natural infection, n=24 Live Attenuated vaccine) and HBV 252 antibodies (n=17 natural infection, n=16 HBsAg vaccination).
