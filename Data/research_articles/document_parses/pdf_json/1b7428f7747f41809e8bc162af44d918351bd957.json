We quantified variation in thermal physiology by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) at different test and acclimation temperatures for 16 species of salamanders with varying latitudinal extents. A phylogenetically-controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) was then employed to determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide-and narrow-ranging species at different acclimation temperatures. In addition, we tested for a relationship between the acclimation ability of species and the environmental temperature ranges they inhabit. Further, we investigated if there is a trade-off between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and thermal acclimation ability. MCMCglmm results show a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrowranging temperate salamanders.

Broader tolerances may include physiological plasticity (such as thermal acclimation), which enables an animal to express a wider range of thermal sensitivities (Brattstrom, 1968; Feder, 1978; Spicer & Gaston, 1999) . Thermal acclimation provides a reversible physiological adjustment in response to environmental conditions and offers an energetic advantage over individuals that experience a time lag in physiological response (Angilletta, 2009 ). Species with restricted geographic distributions and a narrower range of thermal extremes (e.g., mountaintop endemics) may have less opportunity to evolve thermal acclimation and could be considered thermal specialists for their particular temperature range (Bernardo & Spotila, 2006; Brattstrom, 1968; Gifford & Kozak, 2012; Huey & Kingsolver, 1993) . As mean absolute range in temperature is found to increase with increasing or decreasing latitude from the equator (M\u00fcller, 1982) , a relationship between thermal acclimation ability and latitudinal extent would provide support for the climate variability hypothesis (i.e., a positive relationship should exist between physiological-tolerance breadth and thermal range of the environment) (Stevens, 1989) .

For thermal acclimation of metabolism in particular, several species of wide-ranging temperate amphibians have shown some degree of acclimation (Feder, 1978; Fitzpatrick, 1973; Fitzpatrick & Atebara, 1974; Fitzpatrick, Bristol, & Stokes, 1971; Fitzpatrick et al., 1972) , whereas two neotropical salamander species were found to have metabolic depression at a higher acclimation temperature (Feder, 1978) . Similar to our results, these studies suggest that thermal acclimation is most prevalent among species experiencing higher degrees of environmental temperature variation.

The New World temperate zone is the center of origin for plethodontids, with the clade more recently colonizing and radiating in the New World tropics (Wake & Lynch, 1976; reviewed in Kozak, 2017) . Plethodontid lineages that radiated rapidly into different thermal regimes could have done so by gaining adaptive physiological ability over other close relatives with similar ecologies. Therefore, rapid expansion of leading-edge populations with broad tolerances may help to explain the lack of among-population variation within wide-ranging species (Sage & Wolff, 1986; Zink & Dittmann, 1993) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 192, "text": "Bozinovic et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 193, "end": 208, "text": "Hereford, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 209, "end": 252, "text": "Hurme, Repo, Savolainen, & Paakkonen, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 253, "end": 275, "text": "Rehfeldt et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 276, "end": 299, "text": "Snyder & Weathers, 1975", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 300, "end": 316, "text": "(Petranka, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 317, "end": 329, "text": "Wells, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 430, "end": 448, "text": "(Brattstrom, 1968;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 449, "end": 473, "text": "Hoffmann & Watson, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 732, "end": 755, "text": "(Parmesan et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 756, "end": 769, "text": "Pielou, 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 923, "end": 943, "text": "(Wake & Lynch, 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 944, "end": 968, "text": "reviewed in Kozak, 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1342, "text": "(Sage & Wolff, 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1365, "text": "Zink & Dittmann, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| D ISCUSS I ON"}, {"text": "Although temperature is thought to be a critical factor in limiting species' distributions in North America (Merriam, 1984; Root, 1988 ; Whitton, Purvis, Orme, & Olalla-T\u00e1rraga, 2012), our analysis did not consider other variables known to influence geographic ranges in this group. For instance, other habitat requirements (e.g., precipitation), and biotic factors including competition could also limit species' ranges and thereby contribute to variation in range size. However, for salamanders, precipitation alone was not found to be a significant predictor of distributions in other studies looking at salamanders (see Quintero & Wiens, 2013) , and interspecific interactions have only been found to limit portions of distributions (Deitloff, Church, Adams, & Jaeger, 2009; Gifford & Kozak, 2012; Jaeger, 1971) . As many of the species in this study are found to coexist regionally and locally (Adams, 2007; Highton, 2004) , it suggests that biotic interactions do not underlie variation in geographic range size in the clades we examined. While temperature and physiology alone are not likely to explain all of the aspects of a species' range, there is empirical support for the strong influence of these factors in determining geographic distributions (Addo-Bediako et al., 2000; Calosi et al., 2010; Gaston, 2003; Hillman et al., 2009 ). In addition, we also did not investigate seasonal and developmental plasticity of these traits, which could potentially influence the extent of the Finally, one question that remains is whether there are any evident trade-offs or relationships in physiological traits for these species of salamanders. Stillman (2003) proposes that species that have evolved the greatest tolerances to high temperatures may have done so at the expense of acclimation capacity. However, similar to the results of Calosi et al. (2008) , we find that species with the lowest tolerances to warm temperatures (measured as CTMax) also have the poorest acclimation ability to warm temperatures. This relationship suggests that both traits are potentially good predictors of how a salamander species may respond to climatic change and further highlights the vulnerability of narrowranging salamanders to global temperature increase (Calosi et al., 2008) .
