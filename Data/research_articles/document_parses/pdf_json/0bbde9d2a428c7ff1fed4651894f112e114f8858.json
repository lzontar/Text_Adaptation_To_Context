The licensed insulin preparations in the UK are either of porcine (Caninsulin s , Intervet Schering-Plough Animal Health, Milton Keynes, UK) or bovine origin (Insuvet s Lente & Insuvet s PZI, Pfizer Animal Health, Sandwich, UK). Since both differ from feline insulin, treatment with either could stimulate an immune response. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) in insulintreated diabetic cats, and to examine any difference in immunogenicity between insulin preparations. Newly diagnosed, untreated diabetic cats were also assessed for presence of insulin autoantibodies. Additionally, anti-protamine antibodies were investigated in cats treated with protamine zinc insulin.",

Treatment using porcine insulin did not give a significantly higher prevalence of AIA than treatment with bovine insulin. Presence of insulin autoantibodies in newly diagnosed diabetic cats was not demonstrated. Treatment with protamine zinc insulin did not seem to stimulate anti-protamine antibodies, and in fact some control cats demonstrated antibodies against this protein, possibly as the result of exposure in the diet. The clinical significance of AIA remains unclear and further work is needed to investigate any role in diabetes management. In veterinary practice, cats may be more difficult to handle than dogs due to their species-specific behaviour. Therefore, certain diagnostic procedures may necessitate sedation.

            "text": "In conclusion, anaemia arose most commonly due to infectious and neoplastic disease. The degree of anaemia did not affect initial outcome but cats with immune-mediated disease were most likely to have more severe anaemia and survive to discharge. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), an immune-mediated disease triggered by a mutated form of the ubiquitously occurring feline coronavirus (FCoV), is one of the leading infectious causes of death among cats. As the proportion of cats presenting with ''classical''manifestation of FIP is thought to have decreased in the past decades, the purpose of this study was to investigate historic, clinical, and laboratory features of FIP in a large number of recent, naturally occurring cases of FIP. The medical records of cats presented to the Clinic of Small Animal Medicine of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, between January 2000 and March 2007 were evaluated retrospectively. Of these, 186 with FIP confirmed via histopathology (n 5 162) or immunostaining of FCoV antigen in macrophages (n 5 24) were included in the study. Signalment, history, clinical signs and laboratory parameters were analysed using SPSS 17.0 statistical software. Age, sex, and breed distribution of cats with FIP were compared with the clinic population between 2000 and 2007. A p-value o 0.05 was considered statistically significant. As in previous studies, males were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with FIP (p o 0.001). The age of infected cats ranged from 2 months to 19 years (median: 1 year) and young age was significantly associated with disease (p o 0.001). Domestic cross-breed cats were commonly affected (155/ 186) and among purebred cats, only Devon Rex cats were at an increased risk of disease (p 5 0.010). Deaths from FIP were observed more frequently in fall and winter (60%). In contrast to past studies, the majority of cats (71%) lived in single-or two-cat households at the time of diagnosis and 25% had outdoor access. Similar to previous investigations, effusion was evident in 74% of cats with FIP. Lymphopenia and elevated serum protein was documented in only 50% and 15% of cats respectively, while hypoalbuminemia (63%) and an albumin globulin ratio o 0.6 (65%) was observed more commonly. Hyperbilirubinemia occurred significantly less frequently in cats with non-effusive FIP (45%) compared to cats with effusive FIP (68%) (p 5 0.018). Interestingly, at necropsy CNS involvement did not differ significantly between cats with and without effusion (17% and 20% respectively). This study indicates that history and clinical signs classically associated with FIP are not evident in a considerable percentage of confirmed cases. Non-effusive FIP was common. Although considered rare, nearly one-fifth of cats showed both effusion and granulomatous lesions. Feline parvovirus (FPV) and feline coronavirus (FCoV) are two viruses responsible for feline panleukopenia and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) respectively. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that feline panleukopenia has to be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of straw-colored abdominal fluids in kitten.",

The dietary management of constipation in cats is either based on high fiber diets (total dietary fiber 4 20% as fed basis) or on highly digestible diets supplemented with various soluble fiber. High levels of insoluble fibers, such as cellulose might not be as efficient in chronic feline constipation and could even worsen the clinical signs.

Ectopic ureters occur quite often in Briard dogs. Investigating the inheritance and development of genetic markers require identification of phenotypic carriers, which may be non-symptomatic. Sonography was evaluated for diagnosis of ectopic ureters and is accurate, but not as reliable as CT. Endoscopy and CT are obviously not useful for population screening. B-Flow sonography is a novel colorflow imaging technique using digital encoding technology to enhance weak signals from flowing compounds, eliminating competing signals from stationary tissues and suppressing noise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate B-flow sonography during enforced diuresis by dimazon for the imaging of the uretero-vesical junction and assessment of normal and abnormal anatomy in Briard dogs. Briard dogs in this study were non-symptomatic, client-owned and examined with owner's consent without sedation. A pilot study had proven the effect of dimazon on the identification of the ureteral orifice and the negligible influence of bladder volume on measurements of the distance between uretero-vesical junction (UVJ) and vesico-urethral border (VUB). Six adult males and 6 adult females were examined 10 minutes after s.c. injection of dimazon. B-flow colour images using a 10-14 MHz transducer of a GE Logic 7 Ultrasound unit were obtained in longitudinal and transverse transabdominal scans of the bladder neck region. Jet phenomena of the urine entering the bladder were identified for each ureter and revealed a typical shape (boomerang or sword-like). Imaging allowed assessment of the exact position for each ureter entering the bladder at the base of the jet and measurement of the distance between UVJ and VUB for each ureter. The technique was then applied in 19 mature males, 13 mature females, and 7 puppies at the age of 6 weeks (4 f, 3 m). Body weight ranged from 26-46 kg in mature, from 7,2-9,9 kg in puppies. In 6 dogs (4 male, 2 female, one puppy), an abnormal intramural course of the ureter was found and the ureterjet could not be identified, as seen in clinical cases. In the other mature dogs distance between UVJ and UVB was 0,6-3,3 cm for the left ureter, 0,8-3,2 cm for the right ureter, 0,8-1,5 cm and 0,7-1,2 cm in puppies, respectively. It is concluded that B-flow sonography during enforced diuresis is a suitable imaging technique to assess the UVJ in dogs for screening purposes and anatomic studies. Briard dogs show a wide variation of UVJ anatomy, difference between left and right UVJ position and subtypes of clinically relevant ectopia. Bacterial culture of urine is commonly performed in veterinary practice. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal method of canine and feline urine submission to the laboratory for culture. We also compared the results of culture with findings on sediment examination.",

HR decreased when recordings were made by owners alone, indicating a 'white-coat effect' of the veterinarian. Labradors had lower DBP and HR during several situations. Hence, breed differences should be taken into consideration when evaluating BP and HR in a clinical environment. The accuracy of the blood pressure (BP) measurement can be influenced by several factors, such as the used technique, breed, and stress level of the dog. The purpose of this study was to compare the systolic arterial pressure (SAP) measured on dogs by three different indirect measurement devices: Doppler, high definition oscillometry (HDO) and oscillometry (OS). The study has been part of the EUfunded LUPA project (eurolupa.org), aiming at the discovery of genetic determinants for BP as well as cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in dogs. This study included 120 clinically healthy, nonobese male dogs, aged 2-5 years: German shepherd dogs (GSD; n 5 49), Finnish Lapphunds (FLH; n 5 47) and Dachshunds (DH, n 5 24). BP was measured under standardized and calm environmental conditions in an animal hospital. The measurements with the three devices were made simultaneously or directly one after the other, while dogs were in lateral recumbency. Several prior measurements were taken from each dog before the average of four stable and consecutive measurements was calculated. During each measurement, the effect of stress was estimated. The stress level scores were: calm/sleepy, still but tense, restless, very restless (afraid / aggressive), and measurement impossible. Acceptable SAP results with parallel use of all three devices were obtained with 84 of 120 dogs. The study revealed no significant difference in SAP when comparing the results of all three devices: Doppler (Mean AE SD: 135.6 AE 12.9 mmHg), HDO (138.6 AE 12.4), and OS (138.9 AE 11.1). However, there was a tendency that Doppler showed lower results compared with two other devices. Both, the stress level and the breed had a significant effect on the SAP results (p o 0.001). There was the tendency for higher SAPs with higher stress levels. GSDs had significant higher SAP (Mean AE SD: 142.3 AE 12.6 mmHg) than FLH (135.6 AE 11.4), and DH (131.7 AE 9.3, p o 0.001). In conclusion, under standardized environmental condition Doppler, HDO, and OS give comparable results. Stress level should be taken into consideration when assessing SAP results. However, breed seems to have an important influence on SAP. The breed differences could be genetically determined. The stress induced by the indirect blood pressure measurement procedure may contribute to increase systolic blood pressure and sometimes lead to a false diagnosis of hypertension. Cortisol dosage has already been used as an indicator of stress state in dogs.",

Therefore, in nervous dogs such as working Belgian Shepherds, the HDO method seems more suitable than the Doppler method. Serum acute phase proteins (APPs) were measured and associated with the clinical and clinicopathological variables in dogs naturally infected with Ehrlichia canis. C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid-A (SAA), haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin and albumin concentrations were compared between 27 dogs with spontaneous non-myelosuppressive canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME; Group A), 29 dogs with myelosuppressive CME (Group B) and 7 healthy dogs (Group C). APP concentrations were associated with the clinical outcome (recovery or death), adjusting for selected clinical and hematological variables. Diagnosis of CME was based on clinical and clinicopathological findings on admission, seropositivity to E. canis, PCR amplification of E. canis specific 16S rDNA and/or the observation of Ehrlichia sp. morulae in blood smears, and bone marrow (BM) cytology. Acute phase protein concentrations were determined in serum samples collected on admission. Increased concentrations of CRP, SAA, haptoglobin, and ceruloplasmin were found in 100, 64.3, 43.5, and 100%, of dogs with CME, respectively; hypoalbuminemia was found in 87% of the dogs. Mean concentrations of CRP, SAA and haptoglobin were significantly higher in group B, compared to either group A or C dogs, but no significant differences were found in the concentrations of ceruloplasmin and albumin by applying ANOVA. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that APP concentrations were not associated with the disease outcome; the latter was strongly associated with pancytopenia (odds ratio for death, 22.7) and neutropenia (odds ratio for death, 7.7). In conclusion, CRP, SAA and haptoglobin concentrations appeared to be significantly higher in dogs with myelosuppressive CME compared to non-myelosuppressive CME, but were not useful for predicting the clinical outcome. Naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, accounting for 3-10% of peripheral CD4 1 T cells. They are identified on the basis of high constitutive expression of both the IL-2 receptor a\u00b4chain (CD25) and the transcription factor FOXP3. Preliminary studies conducted by us and others have demonstrated FOXP3 expression by CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells isolated from the blood and peripheral lymph nodes of systemically healthy dogs. However, little is known about Treg function in this species. Here we report the isolation and suppressive properties of these cells.",

In addition to b-lactams two isolates were resistant to macrolides, lincosamides (ML) and (fluoro)quinolones (FQ) and one isolate to ML and tetracycline (TC). All MRSA isolates showed different SmaI and ApaI patterns. The MRSP isolates harboured SCCmec II-III. They showed very similar susceptibility patterns with resistance to b-lactams, ML, FQ, TC, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and tiamulin. The MRSP isolates differed distinctly in their SmaI patterns. Among the 64 dogs, 27 dogs harboured an MRS isolate in each site sampled with indistinguishable isolates in all cases. The highest evaluated risk factors for MRSP were former hospitalization and previous antibiotic therapy. Of the 48 dogs, which had been hospitalized within 6 months before sampling, 42 (87.5%) dogs also had received antimicrobial agents within the last six months.",

This study identified prior hospitalization and/or antibiotic therapy as main risk factors for MRSP carriage in dogs. Therefore infection control measures need careful attention and antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated for every single case. Calprotectin (CP) is a heterodimeric protein complex abundant in neutrophils and macrophages. CP is contained in infiltrating myelomonocytic cells at sites of inflammation, where it is actively or passively released into the extracellular space as a result of cell disintegration. To screen patients prior to more invasive investigations, several noninvasive markers have been suggested in human patients with inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions. The concentration of fecal CP has been shown to be a useful marker for organic disease being higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in healthy controls. In dogs a radioimmunoassay for the quantification of canine calprotectin (cCP) has recently been developed for fecal samples. The assay was described as sensitive, linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible [Heilmann RM. AJVR 2008; 69: 845] . To our knowledge fecal cCP concentrations have only been described in healthy adult dogs. This study aims at investigating fecal cCP in puppies with and without diarrhea at weaning.",

The higher concentrations of cCP observed in younger puppies may be linked to a higher permeability of the intestinal mucosa or might also be associated to the presence of milk in the regime. The higher cCP concentrations in puppies infested by Isospora spp. could be explained by the inflammatory response to the protozoan. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed by biopsies. Further research into the clinical usefulness of the measurement of fecal cCP concentrations in dogs with histologically confirmed inflammatory conditions are warranted and are being conducted. Canine parvovirus (CPV) remains a leading cause of enteritis in young dogs. To date no agent-specific treatment exists, so treatment remains symptomatic and supportive. Without treatment CPV infection is often fatal. Due to the high cost associated with treatment, early and more effective prediction of outcome will have both an economic and clinical impact. Objective and easily accessible parameters for outcome are preferred. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a major positive acute phase protein in dogs. It has been used extensively in human and animal medicine as a quantitative marker for inflammatory activity in disease processes and is often useful as a prognostic indicator, especially when serial measurements are used.",

Together with other known prognosticators however, like blood leukocyte changes, CRP may prove to be a useful early predictor. Cytokine gene expression in nasal mucosa from dogs with sinonasal aspergillosis (SNA) is characterised by increased mRNA expression of IFN-g and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Failure to clear the infection, despite this local Th1 inflammatory response, may be related to the increased IL-10 and/or TGF-b expression, presumably by regulatory T cells, in this nasal mucosa. However, these mRNA expression studies have used mucosal biopsies rather than isolated T-cells.

Sino-nasal aspergillosis (SNA) and idiopathic lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis (LPR) are two of the most common causes of nasal discharge in dogs. Previous studies have shown that in these diseases there are distinct cytokine and chemokine gene expression profiles in the nasal mucosa. The innate immune system relies on a variety of pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and NOD-like receptors (NLR), to sense microbial structures that are present in pathogens. Activation through these receptors leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Innate immunity has gained significant attention in human medicine as differential expression and polymorphism of certain TLRs has been shown to occur in chronic rhinosinusitis and in response to fungal infections.

Thromboembolism (PTE) in dogs is probably underdiagnosed.Its presence may be suspected in patients with documented hypoxemia, affected with a disease with known risk for PTE, coagulation abnormalities, suspicious radiographic findings, and, with increasing expertise in echocardiography, the recognition of pulmonary hypertension. Depending on the severity of PTE however, arterial oxygen content, routine coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, TT), thoracic radiographs and echocardiography may be unremarkable. For most clinicians, plasma D-dimers have become an important tool to ruleout or -in PTE. Angiostrongylus vasorum infection in dogs consistently causes severe pulmonary lesions with PTE at the time of patency. Unassociated with PTE, in dogs infected with A. vasorum serum fructosamine concentration has recently been shown to be decreased and its measurement suggested as valuable diagnostic parameter in dogs displaying few or atypical signs. We therefore measured plasma D-dimers using an immunoturbidimetric method and serum fructosamine to assess their diagnostic sensitivity in 6 Beagles experimentally infected with 200 L3 A. vasorum larvae. Dogs were examined before infection (T0), once during patency 7-12 weeks post infection (T1), and once 1-5 days after parasiticide treatment (T2).",

Epidemiological studies suggest that numerous infectious agents, including viruses, may contribute to the pathogenesis of a broad range of human and animal diseases. Advances in technology have led to a shift from traditional methods of discovering these new pathogens to modern molecular methods. One of these, next generation sequencing (NGS), involves the parallel sequencing of millions of DNA molecules from a sample of interest. Methods are then employed to remove host sequences thereby enriching for pathogen. The sequencing of complementary DNA (cDNA), rather than genomic DNA, allows the transcribed portion of the genome to be analysed. A method based on NGS of cDNA and subtraction of host sequences from public databases has been developed for viral identification in humans, and is known as transcriptome subtraction. The aim of this study was to validate a method of NGS and transcriptome subtraction for use on canine tissue by using a known virus positive tissue and a combination of public database subtraction together with subtraction against a non-infected tissue.",

Military dogs' training is expensive and time consuming, and some of them have to be retired early in their career because of exercise intolerance. Early detection of those dogs would be interesting, but very little data is available concerning such a population. Aims of the study: to describe the effect of training on simple clinical and biological data before and after a standard exercise in order to gather basic data and determine potentially interesting variables.Material and methods: Seventeen dogs (15 Belgian Malinois, 1 Belgian Tervueren and 1 German Shepherd, aged 2 to 4 years) ran the same 5 km run with their handler at an approximate speed of 10 km/h, at the beginning and the end of their 3 months training in the CNICG. Heart (HR) and respiratory (RR) rates were measured just before (T0), at the end (T1) and 15 minutes after the run (T2); electrocardiogram (EKG) and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded at T0 and T2. Biological data [microhematocrit (mHt), plasma total proteins (TP), creatinine (C), creatine kinase (CK) and lactates (L)] were determined on blood samples obtained at T0 and T2. Water intake between T1 and T2 was recorded. Biological data were considered different if they were outside the critical difference interval. Statistical analysis (paired Wilcoxon test) was performed using Stata software.Results: No dogs exhibited exercise intolerance; all EKG were normal. As expected, RR and HR increased at T1 compared to T0 and decreased at T2 at the beginning and the end of the training period. However, T0 HR at the end of the training was significantly lower (p o 0,05) than at the beginning. Rectal temperature was higher at T2 than at T0 in 8 and 13 dogs at the beginning and the end respectively, with 1 dog having a RT persistently 4 3913C.",

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare condition arising due to defects of the motile cilia. Affected animals are characterized by recurrent inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract, have reduced fertility and can also show a situs inversus. This disease has been described in several dog breeds and is usually recessively inherited. We recently identified a non-sense mutation in a new PCD causative gene within a large European family of Old English sheepdogs (OES) in which we detected more than 30 affected dogs. This large number suggests a high prevalence of the responsible mutation within the European OES population. Two OES with a perfectly similar phenotype have been reported during the eighties in United States (Randolph et al., 1984) .

The disease shows a complex pattern of inheritance, but the strong DLA class II association with DH clearly indicates a role for the immune system in the development of the disease. Many autoimmune diseases are chronic diseases characterized by the presence of autoantibodies. Autoantibodies may also predict specific clinical manifestations, disease severity, and rate of progression. The occurance of autoantibodies indicates a permanent or transient loss of self-tolerance. The aim of this study was to evaluate autoantibodies in the sera of DH patients. We included 1 clinical DH dog and 9 subclinical DH dogs with follow-up samples, and 10 healthy controls in the study. Liver sample was obtained from a euthanized Doberman with mild hepatitis. Western blot assays were used to determine the presence of autoantibodies in DH dog sera towards dog liver proteins with anti-dog IgA as the primary antibody. There was a marked difference between the two groups. In conclusion, autoantibodies against liver proteins were found in all the DH sera before the onset of clinical disease, while the controls showed only weak reactivity. Immune reactivity was also enhanced in DH patients when compared to disease progression, suggesting a role of these antibodies for the hepatocellular injury. Thus, our findings suggest potential utility of an approach to diagnosis of DH before onset of symptoms that includes screening for autoantibodies to defined antigens. The measurement of NT-proBNP in cats is performed in several study groups by using different types of blood samples (serum, EDTA-plasma, heparin-plasma). The stability of N terminal pro BNP is unknown in cats. So the manufacturing company of the cat specific NT-proBNP test gives the advice to centrifuge and freeze samples within 30 minutes.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the serum concentration of cytokines in dogs with different degree of MMVD. Granolycyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-? (INF-?), interleukin (IL) 2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), interferon-?induced protein (IP-10), monocyte-chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) were simultaneous measured using a commercially available canine specific multiplex immunoassay (Milliplex). The study included 68 dogs divided into 5 groups: 1) Cairn Terriers (CT) with no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR), 2) cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) with no or minimal MR, 3) CKCS with mild MR, 4) CKCS with moderate to severe MR, and 5) dogs of different breed with clinical signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to MMVD, stable on treatment. All dogs underwent a clinical examination, hematological and biochemistry evaluation, and echocardiography in connection with the blood sampling. Detectable concentrations of GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, KC, and MCP-1 were found in the majority of included dogs, while canine IFN-?, IL-4, IL-6, IP-10, and TNF-a could only be measured in few dogs, or not at all. Cairn Terriers had a significantly lower serum concentration of MCP-1 than CKCS with no or minimal MR (P 5 .03), CKCS with moderate or severe MR (P 5 .03), and dogs in CHF (P 5 .001) suggesting a breed difference, but also an increase in MCP-1 with disease severity. Assessing the 44 CKCS separately by multiple regression analysis with stepwise, backward elimination, decreasing concentration of IL-7 was associated to increasing MR (P 5 .02) and to increasing left atrium size (P 5 .02). IL-8 decreased with increasing left ventricular end-systolic internal dimensions (P 5 .02). Gender and weight were not associated with any of the cytokines.

These results show that MMVD in dogs is associated with changes in certain inflammatory parameters.",

In a retrospective study of 500 dogs, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) was diagnosed in 24% of dogs and atrial fibrillation (AF) was found in 21% of this population. There historically appears to be an association of atrial fibrillation with DCM. In this same retrospective study, atrial fibrillation was noted in 87% of dogs with cardiomyopathy. Of the 49 dogs diagnosed with occult DCM, 73.5% of this group was in atrial fibrillation. Our study assessed the occurrence of cardiac disease in a non referral population of Irish wolfhounds.

The presence of atrial fibrillation conferred no difference in the incidence of DCM compared to dogs in normal sinus rhythm. As such until better testing modalities are developed, based on current data, echocardiography screening should continue to be utilized to assess for occult DCM in both IW dogs with NSR as well as those in atrial fibrillation. Feline and canine left-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by an increase in resting respiratory rate. Recent studies have suggested that a resting respiratory rate in hospital 4 44 breaths/minute was the most sensitive and specific indicator of CHF in dogs. The sleeping respiratory rate (SRR) at home might provide additional and more specific indication of onset of CHF in dogs and cats, allowing owners to present patients for evaluation before severe CHF develops. Indeed, cardiologists have routinely recommended that clients monitor the resting or sleeping respiratory rate of pets with either subclinical heart disease or drugcontrolled CHF to determine when treatment adjustments might be required. However, little is known about the dynamics of SRR apparently healthy dogs and cats. Therefore, we sought to examine the dynamics of SRR in these species.",

Dogs with higher SRRmin have less day-to-day variability. These data form the basis for further investigations into the utility of SRR in managing patients with severe pre-clinical heart disease or CHF. A relationship between body size and heart rate (HR) has been described in several studies. However, body surface area (BSA) appears a more appropriate way to express such relationship. BSA does not have an isometric relationship with mass, and allometric scaling has been introduced to describe this variation in comparative physiology. HR in mammalian species follows a similar relationship, being inversely proportional to the size of the animal and, perhaps based on these considerations, HR in healthy dogs is generally believed to be inversely proportional to the subject's size, with toy breeds showing higher HR than giant breeds. However, this common belief is in conflict with some previous data, as well as our own our clinical experience, having observed over the years a negligible difference between the measured HR in dogs of different sizes presented for clinical examination. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to test the null hypothesis that body size is not correlated to HR in healthy dogs in the clinical setting. A second objective of this investigation was to assess whether other variables, such as gender, breed morphology, age and demeanour, may have a significant effect on dog's resting heart rate.",

PTT is an index of cardiac performance and is the time required for a unit of blood to pass through the lung circulation. PTT is usually normalized for heart rate (nPTT) according to the formula nPTT5 PTT/mRR, where mRR is the mean RR interval duration. The nPTT is equal to the number of stroke volumes that the pulmonary vascular bed holds at any given moment and it is a measurement which is unaffected by heart rate and body size, but changes with reduced cardiac pump function. The normal range is 3.6-5.3 in dogs. The objective of the present study was to estimate the repeatability of PTT and nPTT measurements in normal dogs and the interobserver variability in the dogs of the previous study using the echocardiographic bloodpool contrast media SonoVue s .",

Early recognition of cardiovascular malformations is of great importance to achieve appropriate medical/surgical management, improve outcome and provide an accurate prognosis. Knowledge of prevalence is helpful. The aim of this study was to review the prevalence of congenital heart defects in a large population of dogs in Italy. The medical records of 4480 dogs diagnosed with cardiovascular disease at Clinica Veterinaria Gran Sasso between 1997 and 2010, were reviewed. Congenital heart disease was diagnosed in 976 dogs (21.7%). Single defects were present in 832 cases (85%); 2 concurrent defects in 132 cases (14%) and 3 concurrent defects in 12 cases (1%) corresponding to a total of 1132 heart defects. The most common were pulmonic stenosis (PS) (32%), subaortic stenosis (SAS) (21%) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (20%), followed by ventricular septal defect (VSD) (7.5%), valvular aortic stenosis (AS) (5.6%), tricuspid dysplasia (TD) (3%), mitral dysplasia (1.9%), double chamber right ventricle (1.2%) and atrial septal defect (1%). Among the most common defects, the presence of a concurrent defect was observed in 31% of the times for SAS, mostly PS (51%); 25% of the times for PS, with SAS (36%) and VSD (26%) being the most frequent; and in only 9.5% of PDA cases, mostly with concurrent PS (45%) . Interestingly, VSD was associated with another defect in 48% of the cases, and mostly PS (65%). Seventy-seven breeds were represented, with Boxer (26%) and German Shepherd (10%) being the most common, followed by mixed breed dogs (9.6%). Breed predilection (odds ratio(OR)41.5, p o 0.05) was observed for: 8 breeds in the case of PS, of which the French Bulldog (OR:21), American Staffordshire (OR:10), English Bulldog (OR:5.9) and Boxer (OR:4.8) stand out; 8 breeds in the case of PDA, of which the Australian Shepherd (OR:40), German Shepherd (OR:6.8) and Belgian Shepherd (OR:5.7) stand out; 6 breeds in the case of SAS, of which the German Shepherd (OR:15) stands out; 6 breeds in the case of AS, of which the Bull Terrier (OR:60) stands out; 3 breeds in the case of TD, of which the Labrador Retriever (OR:15.5) stands out. Gender distribution was similar to that of the overall population with males being slightly more frequent (54%) than females (46%). A statistically significant predisposition for males was observed in the cases of PS (OR:1.5), SAS (OR:1.7) and aortic stenosis (OR:2.6) and for females in the case of PDA (OR:2.7) and VSD (OR: 2). Mean age at presentation was approximately 40 months for most defects. The results of this study are mostly in accordance to previous reports with however a higher relative prevalence of PS, with Boxer as the most common breed in PS, SAS and AS. SAS, PS and VSD may frequently be associated with other heart defects. PS associated with SAS and PS associated with VSD may predominate.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common feline endocrinopathies and is considered to have a similar pathophysiological basis to human type 2 diabetes. Several studies have identified risk factors for development of diabetes mellitus in cats, which include age, obesity, inappropriate diet and physical inactivity. However, to date, no specific genetic risk factors have been identified. Genome-wide association studies in humans have identified several genes that predispose to obesity and/or diabetes mellitus, one of which is the melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) gene. The aim of the current study was to identify polymorphisms (SNPs) in the feline MC4R gene and to use these to perform a case:control study to determine whether these candidate gene SNPs were associated with diabetes mellitus in cats.",

Clinical remission is frequent in cats with well controlled diabetes mellitus but only few studies explored predictors of this phenomenon. We showed that levels of glucose, fructosamine, insulin and insulin growth factor-1 at the time of admission were not associated with remission, whereas the glucagon-to-insulin ratio after arginine stimulation was higher in diabetic cats that later did not require insulin. We also showed that remission can occur in diabetic cats with ketoacidosis. Recently, it was reported that the use of insulin glargine, strict glycemic control, and previous corticosteroid administration were associated with remission.

In female elkhounds, the onset of diabetes mellitus is generally related to pregnancy and/or the nine week non-pregnant luteal phase of the oestral cycle. Some dogs recover from their diabetes after termination of the luteal phase, either naturally or after spaying procedures. Medical records from 63 cases of diabetes mellitus in Swedish and Norwegian elkhounds were reviewed and owners were contacted for follow-up information. All dogs in the study were found to be intact females and seven dogs (11%) were pregnant at diagnosis. First symptoms of diabetes mellitus occurred with a median of 30 days (IQR 3-45) after oestrus and dogs were diagnosed within a median of 46 days (IQR 27-62) after oestrus. No autoreactivity towards GAD-65 was detected in any of the dogs. Thirty-nine dogs in the study underwent ovariohysterectomy (OHE) and 34 of these were given insulin therapy either with intermediate acting porcine insulin (Caninsulin s , Intervet, Danderyd, Sweden) or recombinant human NPH insulin (Insulatard s , Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). One dog that did not undergo surgery was also treated with insulin. Eighteen of 39 dogs (46%) recovered from their diabetes after OHE and had normal glucose concentrations (after discontinuing insulin treatment in insulin-treated cases) within a median of 11 days (IQR 1-51) after surgery.

Discussions and pilotsurveys were conducted on this topic with clinicians and diabetic pet owners, leading to the design of a survey aimed at recording clinicians' experiences. 1192 clinicians were subsequently surveyed world-wide. Respondents reported a median of 1 in 10 cats and dogs newly diagnosed with DM to be euthanized on the owner's request at time of diagnosis (cat range: 0-10, inter-quartile range (IQR): 0-2; dog range: 0-10, IQR: 0-1). A median of 1 in 10 cats was reported to be specifically euthanized because of owners' reluctance to start insulin injections (range: 0-10, IQR: 0-1), whereas most reported that this was typically never the case in any of the newly diagnosed diabetic dogs (range: 0-10, IQR: 0-1). A further median of 1 in 10 cats and dogs were reported to have their insulin treatment ceased within one year because of lack of success or compliance (range: 0-10, IQR: 0-2). The following specific factors, involved in the decision to euthanize diabetic animals or stop DM treatment were reported to be ''of great importance'': ''concurrent disease''(45% of respondents), ''costs''(44%), ''animal's age''(37%), ''inadequate control''(35%), ''pet's welfare''(35%), ''impact on lifestyle owner''(32%) and ''injection problems''(17%). Owners were reported to be more likely to opt for insulin treatment when animals were insured (71.5%) or when owners or close family or friends were diabetic (88.7%). Multivariate analysis (ordinal logistical regression) was conducted in order to investigate significance of possible treatment decision influencing factors whilst adjusting for possible confounding demographical factors. Clinicians from Canada and Australia, rural, mixed, non-referral and non-university practices reported to be asked to euthanize newly diagnosed cats and/or dogs more frequently than clinicians from Europe, USA, (sub)urban, 100% small animal, referral and university practices, respectively. Practice pet-insurance percentage did not significantly influence this. In conclusion, although most diabetic pet owners will opt for treatment, still a significant number of diabetic pets are euthanized either at initial diagnosis or within one year despite available treatment options. Frequency and reasons seem influenced by the species in question and the practice type and location. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage renal disease in humans. Microalbuminuria is an early predictor of glomerular dysfunction and urinary immunoglobulin G (uIgG) indicates changes in glomerular size selectivity, whereas urinary retinol-binding protein (uRBP) and N-acetyl--D-glucosaminidase (uNAG) reflect tubular dysfunction in human diabetic patients. Currently, effects of diabetes mellitus on canine renal function are unclear.",

Twelve client-owned dogs with DM were included into the study. Median (range) age was 11 years (5-15), 8 were female (3 intact, 5 spayed), and 4 were intact male; median (range) body weight was 9.5 kg (3.7-45.0). Dogs with relevant concurrent diseases such as hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism, neoplasia, renal insufficiency and dogs with prior administration of diabetogenic drugs were excluded. Nine dogs were newly diagnosed and three had been treated with an insulin zinc suspension. All dogs received glargine BID for at least 6 months, re-evaluations were performed after 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks and included clinical signs, blood glucose curves and measurement of serum fructosamine concentrations. Starting dose was 0.25-0.5 U/kg q12h. Initially, all dogs were markedly hyperglycemic (median 26.4 mmol/l, range 9.6-33.1), and had elevated fructosamine concentrations (median 611 mmol/l, range 320-815). Median (range) glucose concentrations (mmol/l), nadir values (mmol/l) and fructosamine concentrations (\u0131\u00b4mol/l) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 weeks after beginning glargine were 17.9 (5.2-30.5), 15.7 (3.5-31.8), 593 (359-842); 11.0 (4.8-23.9), 10.1 (3.2-22.6), 503 (418-748); 11.3 (4.0-21.8), 8.4 (2.2-18.9), 540 (385-663); 11.8 (6.3-15.9), 8.5 (1.8-14.9 ), 508 (359-597); 10.8 (6.3-18.5), 6.5 (3.1-16.2), 532 (461-584); 11.9 (5.2-17.6), 7.0 (3.3-12.3), 484 (342-691), respectively.

Results emphasize that normal range UCCR should be carefully established for each particular assay. Since several years trilostane is effectively used to treat dogs with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH). Initially, a dose extrapolated from human medicine and adjusted to the available capsule sizes was used in our institution. Since April 2006 trilostane is dosed per kg bodyweight. The objective of our study was to compare the clinical effectiveness, the number of dose adjustments and the side effects of the two different dose ranges. Two groups of dogs with PDH, which had been treated with trilostane for a minimum of three months, were included in this retrospective study. Group 1 (n 5 28) consisted of dogs diagnosed between June 1999-April 2006, which received an initial daily trilostane dose on the basis of 3 categories of bodyweights once daily (o 5 kg, 30 mg; 5 to 20 kg, 60 mg; and 4 20 kg, 120 mg). Group 2 (n 5 20) consisted of dogs diagnosed between April 2006-December 2009, which received 2-5 mg/ kg trilostane once daily. Dogs were re-evaluated after 1-2, 3-6, 7-15 weeks, 4-7 and 8-12 months. Starting doses of trilostane were significantly higher in dogs of group 1 (median 6.1mg/kg, range 3-13) than in those of group 2 (median 3.8mg/kg, range 2-4.3) and stayed significantly elevated until the re-evaluation at 4-7 months. At the first re-check, 82% of the owners of dogs of group 1 and 90% of those of group 2 were satisfied with the general clinical condition of their dogs. Compared to group 2, significantly more dogs of group 1 had a decrease in polyuria and polydipsia (group 1 86%, group 2 53%). Polyphagia and activity had improved in 33% and 81% of group 1, and in 43% and 60% of group 2, respectively. Cortisol before and after ACTH stimulation was significantly decreased at all time points in both groups. Aldosterone after ACTH was significantly decreased at all re-checks only in group 1. There were no differences in cortisol or aldosterone concentrations between the two groups at any time point. Endogenous ACTH concentration tended to increase in both groups of dogs, with no significant difference between the two groups. In group 2 a significant higher number of animals needed a dose increase at the first re-check compared to group 1. In group 1 a significant higher number of animals needed a dose reduction at 8-12 months of therapy compared to group 2. Side effects requiring an intermittent discontinuation of trilostane occurred in 25% of dogs of group 1 and 10% of dogs of group 2. In both groups, trilostane had to be withdrawn in 1 dog. We conclude that, although dogs are started on a lower trilostane dose when dosed per kg bodyweight, clinical improvement and decrease in cortisol concentrations are comparable. Side effects leading to intermittent discontinuation of trilostane tended to occur more often in the dogs dosed on bodyweight categories, but definitive withdrawal of trilostane was required with equal frequency. The measurement of Free-Thyroxine (fT4) by modified equilibrium dialysis (MED) has been demonstrated to be more accurate than other methods, and is therefore considered the single preferred test for assessing thyroid gland function in dogs. For most European practitioners the diagnosis of canine hypothyroidism is constrained by lack of availability of fT4MED, and fT4 is determined by other methods such as chemiluminescence (CH). Little data are available regarding the diagnostic reliability of this assay. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the chemiluminescent assay.

Moreover, changes in microbiota composition alter mucosal gene expression which leads to intestinal inflammation and phenotype of disease in IBD dogs.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is characterized by persistent or recurrent clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease associated with histologic evidence of inflammation. Genetic susceptibility, dysregulation of the immune response, breakdown of tolerance and environmental triggers are thought to be critical in the pathogenesis of IBD. Toll like receptors (TLR) recognize microbe associated molecular patterns and are supposed to play an important role in the regulation of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. TLR2 recognizes lipopeptides, peptidoglycan and lipoteichoid acid, whereas TLR4 detects lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram negative bacteria.

TLR4 is upregulated in invading cells in duodenum and colon in FRD and IBD, but not expressed on the epithelium. Therefore, the invasion of TLR4 positive cells in IBD and FRD could be a key feature promoting the increased inflammation in chronic enteropathies. Furthermore, the blockage of TLR4 with antagonists like TOLLIP could potentially reduce the inflammation in dogs suffering of IBD. Differentiating canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from gastrointestinal lymphoma (GI-LSA) is of huge prognostic significance, but remains a major diagnostic challenge. Haematology, biochemistry, imaging and endoscopic biopsy all fail to clearly distinguish between the diseases, and full thickness biopsies are not considered appropriate in a number of cases. Thymidine kinase (TK) is a cytoplasmic enzyme involved in the one step salvage pathway of pyrimidine synthesis. TK activity is generally downregulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and the enzyme should not be active in cells undergoing natural apoptosis. Any increase in serum activity of the enzyme therefore reflects an increase in cells dying in the replicative phase, releasing TK into the blood, which is likely to happen in neoplasia. Serum TK activity is now a widely used diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring test for multicentric lymphoma in the dog. However, its activity in GI-LSA and in inflammatory diseases such as canine IBD has not previously been assessed.",

Dogs were eligible for inclusion if they had received investigations to include haematology, biochemistry, assays of serum trypsin like immunoreactivity, cobalamin, folate and ideally canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity to exclude pancreatitis, as well as faecal analysis, thoracic and abdominal imaging to rule out disseminated LSA. Dogs should not have received corticosteroids in the previous month which might have put LSA into remission. Diagnosis of IBD or GI-LSA was confirmed by fine needle aspirate, endoscopic or full thickness biopsy, and in some cases of IBD, by response to appropriate symptomatic therapy with adequate follow-up. s-TK was measured by radio-immune assay at the time of initial presentation to the referral centre. Fisher's exact test was used to assess whether there was a statistically significant difference in s-TK between the two groups at different cut-off values where p o 0.05.",

There was no difference between the groups in any biochemical parameters. s-TK ranged 1-6.4 in the IBD group, and 1.4-17.5 in the GI-LSA group. Using a cut-off of 6.5, there was a significant difference between groups (p 5 0.0017), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 60%. At this cut off therefore, any animal with a s-TK of 4 6.5 had GI-LSA but not all dogs with GI-LSA had an elevated TK. Whilst greater numbers are needed, this shows promise as a cheap, easy and useful test to aid this common diagnostic challenge. High prevalences of both cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency and cutaneous mucinosis have been reported in Chinese Shar Peis (Shar Peis). Previously, cobalamin deficiency in Shar Peis with increased serum methylmalonic acid concentrations (MMA) has been linked to a genomic region on canine chromosome 13 by two genome-wide scans. A significant cosegregation was shown for Shar Peis with an undetectable serum cobalamin and an increased serum MMA concentration and both allele 283 of microsatellite marker FH3619 and two canine single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Cutaneous mucinosis in Shar Peis has been suspected to be hereditary and has been linked with an increased hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS 2) gene expression, a gene that is located in the same genomic region on canine chromosome 13. In one study, a deletion of two nucleotides was found in the intron following exon 2 of HAS 2, in close proximity to the exon/intron boundary. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate this intron region in dogs with cobalamin deficiency.",

Dietary fish oil however, had no effect on neutrophil bacterial killing percent. In summary, there was a significant effect of diets enriched in vitamins E and C on increased bacterial killing by circulating neutrophils, and on neutrophil-related gene expression. Two studies were used to evaluate the effect of dietary protein varying from 14.8% to over 30% dry matter (DM) protein on the senior dog's indices of health and ability to maintain lean body mass (LBM). All dogs were exercised daily, and were provided with regular opportunities for socialization and environmental enrichment. Dog enrichment included toys in their enclosures, paired housing for a portion of each day, and trips to an indoor and/or outdoor group socialization area. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Topeka, KS, USA. In the first study, 70 beagle dogs (average age 13.8 years) were fed one of five different foods with protein concentrations, with or without added amino acids, varying from 15.4 to 30.7% dry matter (DM) protein. In all treatments, over the six month period there was a numeric increase in lean body mass and no change in body fat or bone. There was no linear or quadratic effect of protein or amino acid supplementation on lean body mass. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased linearly with dietary protein concentration. Normal blood albumin, hematocrit, and hemoglobin were maintained as were percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils. There was a quadratic effect of protein concentration (P o 0.05) on change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in 6 months with the lowest and highest protein concentration causing an increase in GFR. In the second study a food designed for nutritional support of dogs with renal disease (Prescription Diet s k/d s ) with 14.8% (DM) protein was fed for six months to 15 healthy adult dogs (average age 13.0 years). This resulted in an increase in LBM (P o 0.05), a decrease (P o 0.05) in circulating creatinine and BUN, with no change in albumin, hematocrit, or hemoglobin. There was also no change in lymphocyte, monocyte or neutrophil percentages. In conclusion, these data show that controlling dietary protein concentration to levels (15% DM) used in foods designed to aid in the management of renal disease is sufficient to meet the protein requirements of the senior dog while maintaining standard indicators of health. Previous studies have shown the efficacy of canned and dry magnesium-restricted, urine acidifying diets in dissolving struvite stones in cats; the mean times to dissolution in these studies were 26-36 days (canned food) and 34 days (dry food), respectively.

A previous study showed the efficacy of a dry diet formulated to generate a urinary struvite relative supersaturation (RSS) o1 (Royal Canin Urinary S/O), in dissolving feline struvite uroliths in vitro. The present study was undertaken to determine if a diet with efficacy for dissolving struvite stone in vitro also had efficacy of dissolving struvite stones in vivo.",

Melanie Hezzell, Adrian Boswood, Jonathan Elliott. The Royal Veterinary College, NORTH MYMMS, United Kingdom Monitoring of systolic blood pressure (SBP) is recommended in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The study hypothesis was that higher SBP would be associated with ventricular hypertrophy and reduced survival times. SBP was measured in dogs with naturally-occurring MMVD and healthy control dogs by Doppler sphygmomanometry. The mean of at least 5 measurements was used for analysis. Echocardiographic variables were measured in dogs with MMVD by standard techniques. Results are reported as [Median (IQR)]. Comparisons of continuous variables were made between groups with Mann-Whitney tests. Proportions were compared with Fishers' exact test. Survival times (all-cause mortality) were compared by the log rank test and Cox regression. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient.One hundred and twenty dogs with MMVD and 24 control dogs were studied. There was no difference in age (years) between normal [9.3 (7.0, 11.1)] and MMVD dogs [10.0 (8.4, 11.7)] (p 5 0.206). There was no difference in weight (kg) between normal [11.0 (7.1, 13.5)] and MMVD dogs[10.8 (8.3, 13.4)] (p 5 0.723). There was no difference in SBP (mmHg) between normal[158.2 (149.5, 179.5)]",

Diagnosis of hypothyroidism was confirmed by the results of rhTSH stimulation test. In each sample the FT4 concentrations [fT4] were measured by CH method ([fT4]CH -Immulite s 2000, Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA) and by MED assay ([fT4]MED -Antech Manufacturing, Irvine, CA ) were measured. The laboratory reference ranges for [fT4]CH and [fT4]MED were 3.5-29.0 pmol/L and 6.0-42.0 pmol/L, respectively. Linear regression was calculated between [fT4]CH and [fT4]MED measurements. The agreement between the two methods was assessed using Bland-Altman (B-A) analysis. For all statistical analyses, a P value o 0.05 was considered significant. The mean of [fT4]CH and [fT4]MED values was 15.1 pmol/L (AE 9.3 standard deviation [SD], range 3.1-57.1) and 15.7 pmol/L (AE 14.3 SD, range 0.0-61.0), respectively. The regression analysis showed a coefficient of determination of 0.73 (P o 0.001). The B-A analysis showed a mean difference of 1 0.6 pmol/L (AE 7.9 SD) and limits of agreement (mean AE1.96 SD) of 1 16.1 and 14.9. For values with an average [fT4]MED and [fT4]CH below 10 pmol/L, the B-A analysis showed a mean difference of \u00c04.2 pmol/L (AE 3.4 SD) and limits of agreement(mean AE 1.96 SD) of 1 2.6 and \u00c010.9. The findings of this study suggest that overall, the [fT4]CH assay tends to underestimate the [fT4]MED with a mean difference (1 0.6 pmol/L) which is not clinically significant, but the limits of agreement could be clinically significant. However, for values with an average [fT4]MED and [fT4]CH below 10 pmol/L the [fT4]CH overestimates the [fT4]MED with a mean difference and limits of agreement that may influence the clinical decision in relation to the laboratory reference range of the [fT4]CH. This behaviour of the [fT4]CH assay can be an important limitation in its use in the diagnosis of canine hypothyroidism. 0103-ESCG -JERGENS INTERPLAY OF COMMENSAL BACTERIA, HOST GENE EXPRESSION, AND CLINICAL DISEASE ACTIVITY IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF CANINE INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.

            "text": "Obesity is now recognised to be an important major medical disease, which can lead to a number of associated medical disorders and can reduce life expectancy. Whilst the condition is likely to have an effect of quality of life, limited objective data exist to support this supposition. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to use a standardised and validated questionnaire to determine health related quality of life, both before and after weight loss, in clientowned dogs with naturally-occurring obesity.Thirty dogs were included in the study, and represented a variety of breeds and genders. Median (range) age at enrolment was 84 mo (18-163 mo), body weight was 24.9 kg (5.2-77.0 kg), and body fat (determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) was 43% (27-53%). At the time of initial enrolment, owners were asked to complete a validated standardised questionnaire to determine quality of life (Wiseman-Orr et al, Am J Vet Res 65, 1077; Wiseman-Orr et al, Am J Vet Res 67, 1826). Owners then completed a follow-up questionnaire after their dog had successfully completed a weight loss programme, and had reached their target weight. The completed questionnaire responses were transformed to scores corresponding to each of four factors (vitality, emotional wellbeing, anxiety and pain), and scored on a scale of 0 to 6. The scores were then correlated with responses to direct questions about quality of life (QOL) and pain.Initial QOL scores were lower than the control range (established from median questionnaire scores from a healthy population of dogs) for vitality, and higher than the control group for pain score (implying greater pain). Median (range) percentage weight loss was 25% (10-44%), the rate of weight loss was 0.83%/wk (0.31-1.39%/ wk), and body fat percentage lost was 34% (13-74%). Most owners reported that their dog's QOL had improved, and this corresponded to significant improvements in vitality and emotional well-being, and a significant decrease in pain score.Our results suggest that there is demonstrable improvement in QOL for obese dogs who successfully complete a weight loss programme. Dietary fish oil and antioxidants have been used to modulate immune function in many mammalian species. Previously, it has been shown that feeding high levels of EPA and DHA reduces the delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response in beagles without changing antibody production in response to a novel protein",
