Although most patients with pneumonia make a complete recovery with antibiotics and supportive care, pneumonia remains a common cause of death. Mortality among adults admitted to hospital with pneumonia is approximately 10%, with around half of deaths occurring in patients aged 85 years or older. Pneumonia has been classified according to the location and circumstances in which it develops, distinguishing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), aspiration pneumonia, and pneumonia in the immunocompromised host. Within the category of HAP, most is known about ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP), which is pneumonia arising de novo in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. This pragmatic classification indicates the most likely range of causative pathogens, thus guiding empirical antibiotic therapy. While this classification system has been helpful in guiding treatment, some confusing aspects of terminology have arisen, some of which are worth considering. In particular, strictly speaking, aspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury induced by non-infective liquid entering the lung (for example gastric acid in a patient whose conscious level has deteriorated rapidly, perhaps due to alcohol intoxication, and who cannot protect his/her airway and is vomiting). This scenario is usually witnessed and the aspiration is of moderate volume. Aspiration pneumonia entails repeated, clinically silent and usually unwitnessed entry of small volumes of infected material into the lung, usually from the oropharynx, in patients with chronically impaired swallow and/or consciousness (for example in patients with neurological conditions such as stroke, motor neurone disease, or multiple sclerosis). The distinction is important because, at least initially, aspiration pneumonitis does not require antibiotic treatment. Unfortunately, the two terms are often used interchangeably, and the situation is further confused in that a true bacterial pneumonia can complicate aspiration pneumonitis a few days after the initial aspiration. Similarly, the reader may encounter terms such as \"healthcareassociated pneumonia\" (HCAP), which seeks to distinguish HAP from pneumonia acquired in healthcare organisations other than hospitals (e.g. nursing homes), but the range of organisms implicated are not sufficiently different for us to make the distinction here. Finally, as VAP becomes increasingly used as a marker of healthcare standards, a bewildering and confusing array of new terms (e.g. ventilator-associated events, ventilator-associated conditions, infective T.

Very occasionally these defences are overwhelmed, and AMs signal recruitment to the alveolus of a cellular inflammatory exudate, predominantly composed of neutrophils. Neutrophils are avidly phagocytic cells, recruited to engage, ingest, and kill bacteria. Bacteria are packaged into phagolysosomes inside neutrophils, within which reactive oxygen species and high concentrations of proteolytic enzymes are generated, leading to bacterial death. It is generally believed that the cytokines generated locally and systemically to recruit neutrophils contribute to the fever, malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, confusion, and delirium experienced by patients. In severe pneumonia, a significant contribution to lung destruction may come from toxic contents of neutrophils being spilled extracellularly and \"attacking\" the host, although there may be a contribution from bacterial virulence factors also.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathological-Clinical Correlates in Pneumonia"}, {"text": "During the battle between bacteria and neutrophils, the alveolar spaces become packed with neutrophils and exudate (consolidation), while alveolar walls are expanded by engorged capillaries. Each involved alveolus is therefore effectively contributing to \"shunt,\" with perfusion but no ventilation. Dyspnoea, and ultimately hypoxaemia, ensues if sufficient alveoli are involved. Because adjacent bronchi are not involved, if enough alveolar tissue is consolidated the chest X-ray (CXR) or CT scan often reveals the classical \"air bronchogram\" (Fig. 10.1) . Similarly, air flows down a bronchus unimpeded in pneumonia, but breath sounds are distorted and amplified by the consolidated alveoli, which leads to bronchial breathing on auscultation, and whispering pectoriloquy. In practice, however, pneumonia is more commonly a patchy process ( Fig. 10.2 , left panel), with foci of infected alveoli rather than one large contiguous area of consolidation. Therefore, inspiratory crackles (as inspired air opens partly consolidated alveoli) are a far more common auscultatory finding than bronchial breathing.

Exudate fluid is rich in plasma proteins including fibrinogen.

These effusions are divided into \"parapneumonic\" effusions (in which the pleura produces a reactive exudate in response to inflammation but the pleural space is not itself infected), and empyema (in which the pleural space is infected). Parapneumonic effusions usually resorb and resolve spontaneously with clearance of the pneumonia, and scarring is rare.

Once empyemas become loculated, they can wall off chronic pockets of infection, which consume enormous amounts of energy, cause pain, and make chest drain insertion futile in that one tube will only drain one single locule.

S. pneumoniae is a Gram-positive coccus with a thick capsule, decorated with antigens that distinguish different serotypes. These antigens lend themselves to the development of vaccines and diagnostic tests. The beta-lactam ring of penicillin binds and inhibits the cross-linking of peptidoglycan, a pro-cess crucial to cell wall formation in bacteria such as S. pneumoniae. The dominant place of S. pneumoniae in producing CAP (and the fact that some rarer pathogens that cause CAP are susceptible to penicillin) explains why penicillins such as amoxicillin are at the core of CAP treatment. However, three sets of organisms require special attention in this context. Soon after the widespread use of penicillin dramatically reduced mortality from CAP, it became apparent that some forms of CAP were \"atypical\" in not being susceptible to penicillin, generally occurring in younger patients, and having a tendency to extra-pulmonary manifestations alongside the pneumonia. The pathogens responsible for these \"atypical pneumonias\" were soon characterised as having no cell wall (and hence being inherently resistant to penicillin). These include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila psittaci, which generally cause self-limiting infections, but can produce severe pneumonia. The major concern in this group relates to Legionella pneumophila, which can cause severe and life-threatening pneumonia, and a range of extrapulmonary manifestations including cardiac, neurological and renal disease; diarrhoea; hyponatraemia; hypophosphataemia; and muscle pains with high serum creatine kinase. Legionnaire's disease is transmitted by droplets from contaminated water in cooling towers or air conditioning systems, and has been the focus of high-profile outbreaks and public health investigations. Because L. pneumophila can cause moderate and severe pneumonia, guidelines recommend that macrolides are added to penicillin in these scenarios.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"}, {"text": "The second important caveat relates to influenza. During influenza pandemics, mortality from CAP increases, most dramatically seen in the infamous 1917 outbreak, which is thought to have killed more people than both world wars combined.

The incidence and sever-ity of S. aureus pneumonia is markedly increased during influenza pandemics. S. aureus pneumonia carries a high mortality, and almost all UK strains produce penicillinases. As a consequence, if severe CAP is acquired in an influenza season, flucloxacillin (or other penicillinase-resistant penicillins) are prescribed. It is a common misconception that S. aureus is the only pathogen that complicates influenza. S. pneumoniae behaves more aggressively after influenza, and Haemophilus influenzae (which is usually associated with mild CAP) can cause severe pneumonia when secondary to influenza.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"}, {"text": "S. pneumoniae itself can cause severe pneumonia, and as it is responsible for most CAP, it is not surprising that S. pneumoniae is consistently found to be the organism most associated with severe pneumonia in ICU series.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"}, {"text": "Collectively these observations explain why mild CAP is treated with amoxicillin, and moderate to severe CAP with amoxicillin and a macrolide (with flucloxacillin added during influenza outbreaks). These combinations cover most pathogens most of the time. Occasional clinical clues can suggest specific pathogens, but they are rarely pathognomonic. As discussed earlier, right upper lobe pneumonia with lobar expansion suggests S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae. Cavitation suggests S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, or tuberculosis. The presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases the likelihood of H. influenzae pneumonia, though S. pneumoniae remains the commonest pathogen in CAP secondary to COPD, and some cases of pneumonia in patients with COPD may be caused by Moraxella catarrhalis (which produces beta-lactamase and so is resistant to amoxicillin) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (also resistant to penicillin). Return from foreign travel with pneumonia raises the possibility of Legionnaire's disease (especially after a stay in hotels with air conditioning systems in warm countries), and some particular pneumonias have associations with particular geographical locations (for example melioidosis in South East Asia and Northern Australia, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] outbreaks).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Community-Acquired Pneumonia"}, {"text": "HAP is defined as new pneumonia arising two or more days after admission to hospital, and which was not evolving in the community prior to admission.

There are three main problems to consider in relation to microbiological sampling of the respiratory tract. The first is that many patients with pneumonia have no sputum production. Secondly, patients are commonly already taking empirical antibiotics on presentation to hospital, and it is recognised that sputum culture is less likely to give an accurate reflection of pneumonia in that setting. Thirdly, as pneumonia is infection of the alveolar regions of the lungs, it is often hard to be certain that the sample is derived from the relevant part of the respiratory tract.

Because mucus production in the conducting airways is markedly increased in mechanically ventilated patients, tracheal aspirates are poorly reflective of alveolar pathology, and contribute significantly to false positive diagnoses of pneumonia. Unlike in most cases of CAP or HAP, the clinician has potential access to the alveolar space in that bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be performed under controlled circumstances via the endotracheal tube, and high-quality BAL specifically samples the relevant region.

The ideal scenario is generation of Annual Annual a rapid, near-patient blood test that discriminates pneumonia from other causes of lung inflammation. This remains a distant aspiration, but there is much activity and interest in finding truly diagnostic biomarkers. There is also considerable interest in obtaining microbiological diagnoses from less-invasive specimens. Some caution needs to be exercised here. There has been an explosion of interest in the microbiome, and in whole genome sequencing of pathogens. This has fundamentally re-positioned our understanding of the normal and disease-associated microbiome deep in the lung. However, the relationship between detailed molecular microbiology of pneumonia and effective change of management is far from being worked out. Until it is, one concern is that the extreme sensitivity of molecular diagnostics may lead to detection of harmless commensals that are misinterpreted as pathogens, in turn leading to overuse of antibiotics. A third area of interest attracting increasing interest (particularly in sepsis research) is the contribution of the host innate response to outcomes in severe infection. There is an intriguing body of literature suggesting that an over-active or under-active innate immune response to serious infective or non-infective insults may dictate clinical outcomes to a greater extent than the infection itself.
