[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The effect of temperature on mortality varies throughout the year, and may be in opposite directions for different times of year. We used two sets of models, one without temperature and one with a weekly term for temperature anomaly, defined as deviation of weekly temperature from the local average weekly temperature over the entire analysis period. The coefficients of temperature anomalies were specified as a random effect with a random walk prior of order one, so that temperature effect is more similar in adjacent weeks. The random effect had a circular structure so that late December and early January are treated as adjacent.",

We also found that when all-cause mortality is considered, the mortality impact of the pandemic on men (~46% increase in deaths) and women (~40% increase in deaths) is more similar than when comparing deaths assigned to Covid-19. Deaths that were not assigned to Covid-19 made up 24% of all excess deaths, but had diminished in most age-sex groups by the first week of May. We also rule out, with virtual certainty (posterior probability >99.99%), the hypothesis that the death toll of the pandemic may be smaller than direct Covid-19 deaths either because some of those dying of Covid-19 would have died in this same time period from other underlying conditions even if the pandemic had not occurred, 23, 24 . Further, although children and young adults may have experienced shot-term declines in deaths, taken across all age groups any \"positive\" impacts of the lockdown (e.g., reductions in deaths due to air pollution or traffic injuries) are dwarfed by the negative impacts of the epidemic.",

By modelling death rates, rather than simply the number of deaths as is done in most other analyses, we account for changes in population size and age structure. The models incorporated important features of mortality, including seasonality of death rates, how mortality in one week may depend on previous week(s) and the seasonally-variable role of ambient temperature. The use of a modelling framework, as we have done, allowed us to make estimates by age group and sex, and, as data become available, will allow doing so for specific causes of death and subnational geographies which would, because of smaller numbers, not be possible for other methods. We used an ensemble of models which typically leads to more robust projections and represent both the uncertainty associated with each individual model and that of model choice. 21 Finally, this framework, specifically the inclusion of seasonality and ambient temperature, is well suited for more robust estimation and standardised comparisons of excess deaths across countries on a real-time basis.",

Further, weekly mortality files from the ONS cover deaths registered in any given week. These include some deaths from prior weeks and leave out some deaths in the reporting week. 26 However, the approach is consistent over time and does not affect year to year comparisons, including for 2020 as the lags in registration of deaths assigned to Covid-19 seem to be the same as those from other causes. 27 It is likely that some of the apparently non-Covid excess deaths are due to undetected Covid-19 infections. 28 An example of such deaths are the likely Covid-19 deaths in care homes. 29, 30 Other such deaths may be those who called the NHS helpline or the ambulance service, were advised to self-isolate because their symptoms were not deemed sufficiently severe to be admitted, and died at home. 31, 32 That the share of excess deaths from non-Covid causes became smaller over time may be because with increasing awareness of, and attention to, clinical symptoms more of such deaths are assigned to Covid-19 as the underlying cause. It is also possible that many excess deaths have been caused, and may continue to do so in coming months, by the pandemic due to changes in personal and family economic and employment circumstances, and in healthcare provision, access and utilisation, as evidenced by reductions in A&E attendance and procedures for a diverse range of acute and chronic conditions. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] While the official position on this has been to encourage people to seek care, the situation is more complex: for some accessing care becomes more restricted because their family members are infected and cannot continue supporting them. Others, typically those in limited and marginalised housing and employment, may not do so in fear of losing their livelihood.",
