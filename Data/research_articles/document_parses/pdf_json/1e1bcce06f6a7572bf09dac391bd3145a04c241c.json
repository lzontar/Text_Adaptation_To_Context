The results will be most valid for proportion distributions with smaller variances. To model the degree of adherence to quarantine regulations, or the lack thereof (e.g., the process of individuals leaving the quarantine temporarily for supplies at a common location), a social mixing process was accounted for in the form: where is the number of quarantine clusters, ] and ] the expected number of common-location susceptible and infectious individuals, _ the expected total number of common-location individuals, and \u0303 the common-location contact-rate.

We took into account an incubation time of five days (Li et al. 2020 ), a pre-symptomatic period of infectiousness of one day, and a symptomatic infectious period of another day (awaiting test results). This means a latent period of four days, and symptomatic persons are infectious in the city population during 2 days. Out of all infected persons, however, 10%, 20% or 50% was assumed to remain asymptomatic (Mizumoto et al. 2020; Nishiura et al. 2020) , and therefore not isolated as they remain undetected. We assumed that this proportion of infected persons had an infectious period of 10 days as suggested by Zou et al. (2020) . We modelled a scenario where 0.1% of the population in the high-risk town would be infected (in the latent period) at the time of implementing the quarantine policy, and all infected symptomatic persons would have been already removed from the town(in hospital isolation).",
