            "text": "Influenza virus is an RNA virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family comprised of three medically important genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, and Influenzavirus C. Influenza A virus is the only species in the genus Influenzavirus A. Influenza A viruses are further classified, based on their viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Sixteen HA subtypes (or serotypes) and nine NA subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified. Different influenza A viruses have been isolated from many hosts including humans, pigs, horses, marine mammals and a wide range of domestic and wild birds. Influenza surveillance studies, performed with humans and animals, have provided a wealth of data on the ecology and evolution of influenza viruses related to public health and economic impact [Fouchier et al., 2003; Govorkova et al., 2005; de Jong et al., 2006] . Influenza surveillance requires national and global monitoring of viral activity to determine the antigenic type and subtype of the circulating influenza A viruses. It is also important to detect the emergence of novel viruses, which may cause unexpected outbreaks or produce a pandemic. It is generally accepted that numerous outbreaks in domestic and wild animals, humans, and human influenza pandemics have resulted from interspecies transmission of avian influenza viruses [Neumann and Kawaoka, 2006] . During the last decade, avian influenza A(H5N1) has caused several outbreaks in poultry and infected humans resulting in hundreds of deaths [WHO, 2009] . Nevertheless, the potential of avian influenza A(H5N1) to cause a global pandemic is uncertain and cannot be predicted [Holmes et al., 2005] .",

Nevertheless, the overall prescription rates between 2002 and 2007 for oseltamivir remained at low levels (six prescriptions/1,000 inhabitants per year in the EU Member States) compared to those reported in Japan, where the prescription rate in 2005 was 70.9/1,000 inhabitants per year [Kramarz et al., 2009] . To select the vaccine strains, laboratory methods for characterizing influenza viruses have been primarily focused on changes occurring in the hemagglutinin (HA) genome segment that encodes the major surface antigen of the virus. The characterization of the genome segment coding the neuraminidase (NA) protein is currently much less frequent, even though immunity against this surface protein is also protective [Nicholson et al., 2003 ]. In addition, the introduction into clinical practice of NA inhibitors (NAIs) and, particularly, the natural variation of the NA sequence have increased the frequency of viral resistance. Prior knowledge of antiviral resistance features in potentially pandemic influenza viruses is necessary for global pandemic preparedness, stockpiling, and treatment. In spite of the recent circulation and the low incidence in humans of the potentially pandemic virus A(H5N1), oseltamivir resistance has been detected in infected patients [de Jong et al., 2005; Le et al., 2005] . In the case of seasonal epidemic influenza viruses, resistance to zanamivir has only been found in one, immunocompromised child infected with influenza B virus [Gubareva et al., 1998] , although resistance to oseltamivir in patients infected with influenza A virus was found in 4% of adults [Gubareva et al., 2001] , and 4-8% of children [Regoes and Bonhoeffer, 2006 ] and increases to 18% in Japanese children admitted to hospital [Kiso et al., 2004] . Recently, during the 2007-2008 influenza season, an unusually high incidence of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses was reported in many countries from the Northern and Southern hemispheres [WHO, 2008] . Due to the high rate of circulating resistant strains observed in regions where the use of oseltamivir is low (i.e., Europe), the origin of this increased oseltamivir resistance does not seem to be related to the use of this antiviral drug.",

These factors increase the urgency of determining the genetic composition of circulating and emerging variants and the implementation of versatile and universal methods in virological laboratories to detect and characterize different influenza A subtypes, derived from different host species. In the present study, a universal RT nested PCR-based system was developed to subtypes N1 and N2 in influenza A viruses of animal or human origin. In addition, a method for universal subtyping of H1 and H3 is also described. This simple sequence based method is a useful and less time consuming alternative than phenotypic techniques for the assessment of NAIs susceptibility and should contribute to molecular surveillance of the genus Influenzavirus A.",

All the amplification products of the N1 subtype sequenced belonged to the 2007/2008 influenza season. The sequencing of the NA gene revealed an H274Y substitution, associated with resistance to oseltamivir although sensitive to zanamivir, in two viruses isolated during the 2007/2008 influenza season. The first sample containing the H274Y mutation (GenBanK accession no. FJ573473) was obtained at the 52nd epidemiological week from an influenza vaccinated 13-year-old female patient with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. The second sample containing the virus with the H274Y substitution (GenBanK accession no.

Although virus isolation and phenotypic assays continue to be essential in reference laboratories for further epidemiological characterization and the discovery of new resistance markers, genetic characterization is a useful tool and the molecular approach is an alternative for influenza surveillance as well as diagnostic purposes. The last few years have also seen attempts to extend the surveillance to antiviral susceptibility [Meijer et al., 2006] . This report describes a first round universal primer set that allows reliable amplification of all NA subtypes followed by specific N1 and N2 detection in a second round multiplex nested PCR. The N1 and N2 specific primers set was carefully designed to amplify all N1 and N2 genetic strains regardless of the HA subtype and virus source (human or animal). The strategic location of the primers in the NA gene gives this method the capacity to detect the specific substitutions concerned with the acquisition of clinical resistance to NAIs. At Fig. 2 .

In addition, this assay allows the detection of mutations at codon D151 in A(H3N2) viruses. Substitutions at this position have been reported in the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes but most often in H3N2 viruses . Nevertheless, the relevance of substitution at D151 for in vivo resistance has not been demonstrated [Sheu et al., 2008] .",

The sensitivity of this nested RT-PCR technique is comparable to that of several reported real-time PCR protocols for HA and/or NA subtyping in H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal influenza viruses [Schweiger et al., 2000] , swine influenza viruses [Richt et al., 2004] , H5N1 avian influenza [Aguero et al., 2007] , and H5N1 of avian and human origin [Payungporn et al., 2006] . The capacity of real-time PCR is very limited in as far as detecting multiple targets (e.g., influenza subtyping) or several single mutations in a multiplexed assay because the most recent platforms generally only allow four-color probes [Mackay et al., 2002] . The design of oligoprobes is almost nonfeasible in conserved sites of genes with high rates of variability such as the HA and NA in influenza viruses. Furthermore, the amplicon size (<200 base pairs for most of the assays) is also a restrictive factor. Nevertheless, realtime PCR with TaqMan probes to detect oseltamivir resistance has been reported but only for the recognition of the H274Y mutation in H5N1 influenza viruses [Chutinimitkul et al., 2007] . Up until now, NA subtyping by the conventional PCR [Wright et al., 1995; Poddar, 2002; Takao et al., 2002] and real-time PCR [Schweiger et al., 2000] assays described at present for influenza A viruses do not permit the detection of all the clinical mutations conferring resistance to NAIs. In 2005, a pyrosequencing assay was developed to monitor adamantane resistance [Bright et al., 2005] and, in 2008, pyrosequencing-based technology was also used to detect NAIs resistance [Lackenby et al., 2008] . Although pyrosequencing is not yet available in most laboratories, this assay is a promising method that permits detection of resistance markers in viruses in clinical specimens and allows the differentiation of quasi species (resistant or sensitive) in the same samples.",

The assay using mixed plasmids was repeated five times. The result for three of five assays is shown in Figure 2 (lanes 11-15) , but the results with the other two runs were the same as obtained when using the separate primers. These differences might be because the technique is close to the lowest detection threshold. Therefore, the multiplex PCR format made it possible to detect of both NA subtypes in the same sample without significant loss of the sensitivity. Although infection with different subtypes is not well documented in the literature [Stockton et al., 1998 ] and still remains basically unidentified, this feature is useful for the recognition of a hypothetical co-infection with N1 and N2 viruses (H1N1, H5N1, or H3N2 subtypes). The clinical sensitivity of the assay was assessed with the detection and subtyping of influenza viruses directly from clinical samples. Since the replication efficiency of NAIs resistant viruses might be compromised , molecular detection directly from clinical samples allows genetic characterization independently of the viral replication rate in cell culture and avoids the identification of mutations that are not present in wildtype viruses but are originated by adaptation to cell culture.",

            "text": "For surveillance purposes, different H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of epidemic viruses circulating in humans from the 2004 to 2008 influenza seasons were tested. Although in past seasons H1N2 human influenza virus circulated world wide [Cheung et al., 2006 ], this reassortant virus was not found in the clinical samples or cultures analyzed in Spain. Furthermore, throughout the 2007/2008 influenza season an unusual phenomenon of world wide circulation of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses containing the H274Y mutation was reported. The frequency of resistance ranged from 0% to 69% depending on the geographical location [WHO, 2008] . The same as was reported in other countries, neither of the two cases described here had received oseltamivir, been exposed to patients who had received oseltamivir treatment or who had traveled abroad. Besides, the oseltamivir-resistant rates were different in neighboring countries. These epidemiological data indicate the emergence of an oseltamivir-resistant strain in absence of selective drug pressure. The high rates of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses observed during 2007/2008 influenza season in some countries (e.g., 67% in Norway) contradict on the basis of the H274Y mutation affects the viral fitness. In fact, some studies reported reduced viral replication and transmissibility and other shown similar fitness than the wild-type viruses [Hurt et al., 2006] . The NA sequencing of the 75 selected influenza A viruses allowed the detection of the H274Y mutation in two A(H1N1) strains recovered from two patients during the 2007/2008 season. This mutation confers oseltamivir resistance but does not affect susceptibility to zanamivir [Gubareva, 2004] . Regarding the Gly ! Asp mutation detected at position 353 (354 in N1 numbering), preliminary analysis of the NA sequence data suggest that most of the A(H1N1) viruses with the H274Y mutation studied during the 2007/2008 influenza season had lost the G353D substitution. The characterization of the A(H1N1) 1918 influenza NA gene showed that this position is also aspartic acid in A/Brevig Mission/1/18 and glycine in nearly all other NA proteins, regardless of subtype. Although it has not been proven to date experimentally, the change from G353D/E could result in a conformational change of the protein affecting NA activity and virulence [Reid et al., 2000] . Nevertheless, this mutation was mainly found at the beginning of the influenza season and reverted in the later isolates analyzed in Europe [Hay, 2008] . The HA analysis of the two resistant viruses did not show modifications affecting epitopes or receptor-binding sites. Only one hypothetical neutral polymorphism (E94K) was found in the first oseltamivir-resistant virus but it was absent in the second isolate. The HA1 sequencing of the sensitive viruses circulating during the 2007/2008 influenza season showed one significant polymorphism in Ca antigenic site [Caton et al., 1982] at position 240 (Gly ! Arg) in 8% of the isolates. The homogeneity observed in the HA gene suggests that the resistant A(H1N1) viruses do not form a particular group with regard to the susceptible viruses and there are no amino acid variations that distinguish the HA of resistant from those of sensitive viruses.",

The improvements compared with phenotypic methods include high sensitivity, rapidity, ease of use and, additionally does not require infectious virus in the laboratory. The emergence of influenza virus resistance to NAIs, regardless of the acquisition mechanism, necessitates the implementation of genetic characterization for the NA segment and the expansion of surveillance and diagnostic activities for the detection of resistance to NAIs.",
