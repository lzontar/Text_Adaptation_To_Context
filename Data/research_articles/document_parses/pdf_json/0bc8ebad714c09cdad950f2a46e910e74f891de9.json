Discovering that an infection control protocol is inadequate, or impractical to implement, in the real-world setting of a contagious patient during an infectious outbreak can have potentially severe consequences. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is already known to be associated with a high risk of transmission of disease to HCWs, 4 and is likely to be more transmissible than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 5 Within the ICU, potentially aerosol generating procedures such as manual ventilation and tracheal intubation are known to enhance transmission of respiratory viral disease to HCWs, 6 and therefore introducing robust infection control processes as soon as possible is of paramount importance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 124, "end": 125, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 281, "end": 282, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 491, "end": 492, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1109, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1241, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1424, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although several expert opinion pieces have been written regarding appropriate standards for infection control and prevention of transmission of COVID-19,7\u00c09 few address operational issues, particularly the practical aspects of implementation, such as the ability to achieve an efficient, practical, and reproducible workflow in specific clinical settings. To examine system and operational issues related to our infection control guidelines, we designed and implemented a high-fidelity in situ clinical simulation to replicate admission, including tracheal intubation, of a patient with suspected or known COVID-19 infection.

With the use of in situ simulation as described, we were able to create a workable guideline, visual aids, and workflow that allowed proper implementation of infection control in a real clinical setting. In situ simulation answers the questions 'What could be done better?' and 'What is working well?'. 2 To answer these questions, key components of simulation are: 1) simulation should take place in situ (within the real workplace with normally available equipment and drugs) to re-create the work environment accurately; 2) participants should be working HCWs reflecting the makeup of the clinical environment (doctors, nurses, and supporting staff); 3) scenario should recreate a meaningful clinical event; 4) structured debriefing should be done by a combination of simulation experts and senior management staff to focus on the evaluation of guidelines, systems and workflow (in addition to providing for education of participants); and 5) should be repeated until further useful system observations cease to occur. 10 It is clear that our reported infection control protocol and improvements may not be directly applicable to other ICUs, as systems and processes should be specific to individual institutions and local practices. This report is limited in that the time constraints of an imminent outbreak did not allow a more formal evaluation of methodology, nor provide evidence that the intervention described improved actual practice, or contributed to the actual reduction of transmission to HCWs. Nevertheless, we believe in situ simulation provides a potentially useful tool to rehearse the safe care of patients in anticipation of treating an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19.
