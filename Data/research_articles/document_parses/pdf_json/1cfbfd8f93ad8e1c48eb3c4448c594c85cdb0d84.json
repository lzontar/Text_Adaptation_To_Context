            "text": "Most cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are caused by loss of CFTR expression due to genetic mutations that decrease protein folding efficiency. While the efficiency of NBD1 folding is a limiting step in CFTR biosynthesis, and NBD1 does not reversibly fold in vitro, little is known about how CF-causing mutations affect the de-novo folding landscape as CFTR is synthesized in the cell. To address this question, we examined 10 CF-causing, missense mutations to determine their effect on NBD1 folding intermediates using FRET between an N-terminal CFP donor and a small acceptor dye that were cotranslationally incorporated at specific locations within NBD1 (Khushoo A, et al. Mol Cell. 2011;41:682-92; and Kim SJ, et al. Science. 2015;348:444-8). This approach enabled us to compare compaction of wild-type and mutant nascent polypeptides at defined stages of synthesis and identify mutations that cotranslationally perturb folding of NBD1 nascent polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome. Interestingly, two mutations, A455E and L558S, located within different subdomains of NBD1 showed similar effect in disrupting folding of both the NBD1 \u03b1-subdomain and its \u03b2-sheet core. In addition, A455E and L558S folding defects are transiently observed only during a brief window of synthesis, namely as the \u03b1-subdomain and the \u03b2-sheet core are synthesized, whereas the mutation-induced folding defect was not observed in the full-length domain. Thus, these two mutations appear to affect folding by perturbing the timing of sequential subdomain compactions. Surprisingly, this transient folding defect was observed as the nascent polypeptide emerged from the ribosome, and was not observed if the nascent protein was released from the ribosome into solution. Direct effects of the ribosome on the growing polypeptide chain therefore participate in cotranslational misfolding: first by destabilizing the misfolded state, and subsequently by facilitating eventual compaction of the domain. Remarkably, two suppressor mutations (S492P and I539T) eliminated the observed cotranslational folding defect for A455E NBD1 and partially corrected trafficking of full-length A455E CFTR. Our result indicates that cotranslational folding intermediates are targets for disruption by disease-causing mutations and that mutations which disrupt folding intermediates can have major impact on a final folding outcome in disease. Thus, drugs that target the cotranslational folding pathway may provide an important therapeutic strategy for treating certain misfolding diseases.",

            "text": "An emerging question relevant to CFTR pathogenesis involves dynamics of mRNA utilization, translational velocity, and consequent influence on protein folding. Increasing evidence places the ribosome as an integral contributor not only to peptide primary structure, but also as a mediator of final CFTR conformation. Utilizing Fischer rat thyroid (FRT), CF human bronchial epithelia (CFBE), and primary human bronchial epithelia, we have previously shown that siRNA-mediated suppression of ribosomal protein L12 (Rpl12) results in robust enhancement of F508del-CFTR protein stability, maturation efficiency, plasma membrane localization, open channel probability, and transepithelial ion transport. Through use of leading-edge ribosome profiling and \"omics\" technologies, we found that Rpl12 depletion induces significant slowing of translation initiation and elongation rate, primarily due to increased dwelling occupancy of GC-rich codons within the ribosomal A-site. Rpl12 is located at the base of the 60S P stalk -a structure known to interact with elongation factors -and resides within the GTPase-associated center, which serves as interface for all GTP-bound translation components (e.g. initiation, elongation, and termination factors). We hypothesized that the P stalk may play a role in folding, stability, and/or translational fidelity, and therefore investigated whether Rpl12 silencing might improve other CFTR variants exhibiting defects in processing (G85E, P67L), conductance (A455E), or premature termination (W1282X). Biochemical (Western blot) and functional (Ussing chamber) analyses established that Rpl12 knockdown exerted no effect on P67L maturation, but A455E-, W1282X-, and G85E-CFTR were all partially rescued. Because W1282X correction was of particular interest, we also tested for evidence of translational read-through by assays in FRT cells encoding a C-terminal nano-luciferase cassette cloned downstream (and in-frame) with the complete W1282X CFTR sequence. Our results indicate Rpl12 repression augments nonsense codon read-through of W1282X by several fold, and enhances steady-state levels of W1282X bands B and C. Under Rpl12-depleted conditions, short-circuit current in primary human nasal epithelia with CFTR W1282X/W1282X genotype showed W1282X transepithelial ion transport increased from undetectable values to ~16% of wild-type. Taken together, these results indicate Rpl12 silencing may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing multiple CFTR defects and disease subcategories.

            "text": "Most cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are caused by loss of CFTR expression due to genetic mutations that decrease protein folding efficiency. While the efficiency of NBD1 folding is a limiting step in CFTR biosynthesis, and NBD1 does not reversibly fold in vitro, little is known about how CF-causing mutations affect the de-novo folding landscape as CFTR is synthesized in the cell. To address this question, we examined 10 CF-causing, missense mutations to determine their effect on NBD1 folding intermediates using FRET between an N-terminal CFP donor and a small acceptor dye that were cotranslationally incorporated at specific locations within NBD1 (Khushoo A, et al. Mol Cell. 2011; 41:682-92; and Kim SJ, et al. Science. 2015; 348:444-8) . This approach enabled us to compare compaction of wild-type and mutant nascent polypeptides at defined stages of synthesis and identify mutations that cotranslationally perturb folding of NBD1 nascent polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome. Interestingly, two mutations, A455E and L558S, located within different subdomains of NBD1 showed similar effect in disrupting folding of both the NBD1 \u03b1-subdomain and its \u03b2-sheet core. In addition, A455E and L558S folding defects are transiently observed only during a brief window of synthesis, namely as the \u03b1-subdomain and the \u03b2-sheet core are synthesized, whereas the mutation-induced folding defect was not observed in the full-length domain. Thus, these two mutations appear to affect folding by perturbing the timing of sequential subdomain compactions. Surprisingly, this transient folding defect was observed as the nascent polypeptide emerged from the ribosome, and was not observed if the nascent protein was released from the ribosome into solution. Direct effects of the ribosome on the growing polypeptide chain therefore participate in cotranslational misfolding: first by destabilizing the misfolded state, and subsequently by facilitating eventual compaction of the domain. Remarkably, two suppressor mutations (S492P and I539T) eliminated the observed cotranslational folding defect for A455E NBD1 and partially corrected trafficking of full-length A455E CFTR. Our result indicates that cotranslational folding intermediates are targets for disruption by disease-causing mutations and that mutations which disrupt folding intermediates can have major impact on a final folding outcome in disease. Thus, drugs that target the cotranslational folding pathway may provide an important therapeutic strategy for treating certain misfolding diseases.",

Gregory Fleming James CF Research Center, UAB, Birmingham, AL, USA An emerging question relevant to CFTR pathogenesis involves dynamics of mRNA utilization, translational velocity, and consequent influence on protein folding. Increasing evidence places the ribosome as an integral contributor not only to peptide primary structure, but also as a mediator of final CFTR conformation. Utilizing Fischer rat thyroid (FRT), CF human bronchial epithelia (CFBE), and primary human bronchial epithelia, we have previously shown that siRNA-mediated suppression of ribosomal protein L12 (Rpl12) results in robust enhancement of F508del-CFTR protein stability, maturation efficiency, plasma membrane localization, open channel probability, and transepithelial ion transport. Through use of leading-edge ribosome profiling and \"omics\" technologies, we found that Rpl12 depletion induces significant slowing of translation initiation and elongation rate, primarily due to increased dwelling occupancy of GC-rich codons within the ribosomal A-site. Rpl12 is located at the base of the 60S P stalk -a structure known to interact with elongation factors -and resides within the GTPase-associated center, which serves as interface for all GTP-bound translation components (e.g. initiation, elongation, and termination factors). We hypothesized that the P stalk may play a role in folding, stability, and/or translational fidelity, and therefore investigated whether Rpl12 silencing might improve other CFTR variants exhibiting defects in processing (G85E, P67L), conductance (A455E), or premature termination (W1282X). Biochemical (Western blot) and functional (Ussing chamber) analyses established that Rpl12 knockdown exerted no effect on P67L maturation, but A455E-, W1282X-, and G85E-CFTR were all partially rescued. Because W1282X correction was of particular interest, we also tested for evidence of translational read-through by assays in FRT cells encoding a C-terminal nano-luciferase cassette cloned downstream (and in-frame) with the complete W1282X CFTR sequence. Our results indicate Rpl12 repression augments nonsense codon read-through of W1282X by several fold, and enhances steady-state levels of W1282X bands B and C. Under Rpl12-depleted conditions, short-circuit current in primary human nasal epithelia with CFTR W1282X/W1282X genotype showed W1282X transepithelial ion transport increased from undetectable values to ~16% of wild-type. Taken together, these results indicate Rpl12 silencing may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing multiple CFTR defects and disease subcategories. For premature termination variants and other difficult-to-treat alleles (e.g. splice mutations), it is unlikely that high-throughput compound library screening will identify an agent that specifically binds CFTR. Findings described here suggest that ribosomal proteins, and Rpl12 in particular, should be evaluated as primary targets for discovery of novel small molecules that induce translational read-through.

In order to evaluate the effect on CFTR levels after either drug or other treatment methods on a cellular level, a new tool was designed. We developed a polyclonal antibody capable of detecting the extracellular loop 1 (ECL1) of CFTR without the need of membrane permeabilization. Using this approach in combination with imaging flow cytometry enables us to quantify on a single cell level the effect of cyclic compressive stress (CCS) on pseudostratified primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE). We are able to quantify and localize CFTR based on a virtual longitudinal cut of ciliated cells and clearly show the increase of plasma membrane CFTR upon CCS treatment or 30\u00b0C incubation compared to the nontreated \u0394F508 cells.",

Our results might provide a molecular mechanism by which exercise and/or airway clearance could benefit the CF airway epithelium. Chemistry, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel The dynamics of wild-type (WT)-CFTR at the atomic-scale as well as how it is affected by CF-causing mutations remains largely elusive even after the publication of several cryo-EM structures of the full length protein, primarily due to two reasons: (1) Experimental structures represent only snapshots of the highly dynamic and allosteric CFTR. Thus, cryo-EM, at least as it stands now is not the tool for studying protein dynamics. (2) No structures of CFTR with CF-causing mutations have been published to date. However, CFTR dynamics is critical to our understanding of the mechanism of action of CF-causing mutations and to our ability to counteract their effects through mutation-specific therapies. On the other hand, the published structures provide excellent starting points for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which could be utilized to study CFTR's structure, energetics and dynamics under near physiological conditions. Five cryo-EM structures of CFTR were published to date: Nonphosphorylated, inward facing zebrafish (PDB code 5UAR, resolution 3.73\u00c5) and human (5UAK, resolution 3.87\u00c5) CFTR which are nearly identical; phosphorylated, outward facing zebrafish CFTR (5W81, resolution 3.37\u00c5); thermostabilized dephosphorylated and phosphorylated chicken CFTR (resolution 4.3\u00c5 and 6.6\u00c5, respectively). Here we used the 5UAK and 5W81 structures as template for generating models of WT human CFTR and of several CF-causing mutants including P67L, G551D, and N1303K. These models were subsequently used as starting points for MD simulations.",

We have previously found a favorable correlation between thermal stability and the fluctuation profiles for several NBD1 constructs. This correlation extends to the full length protein. Thus, WT and G551D-CFTR have similar RMSF profiles indicating similar stabilities. This finding is in agreement with experiment. We also find that P67L leads to enhanced fluctuations in NBD2 relative to the WT protein. Thus, this processing mutation likely reduces the stability of CFTR by destabilizing NBD2. P67L could be rescued by R555K. Indeed, the fluctuations of P67L/R555K-CFTR are even lower than those of WT-CFTR. Based on this correlation we predict N1303K and WT-CFTR to have similar stabilities. Next we demonstrate that for G551D-CFTR the distance between the NBDs in the outward facing conformation is lower than that in WT-CFTR, indicating looser packing of these domains.

It has been reported that USP19, an ER membrane-anchored DUB, is a target of the unfold protein response and is involved in the turnover of ERAD substrates (1) . In this study, we explored the potential functions of USP19 in modulating CFTR biogenesis vs. degradation. By screening several DUBs including USP5, USP7, USP11, USP13, USP19, and USP28, we found that USP19 specifically recognized the common CFTR mutant, and that its over-expression robustly elevated the levels of immature CFTR and markedly reduced F508del CFTR degradation. Knockdown of USP19 significantly reduced F508del CFTR protein expression in CFBE cells; conversely, whole-cell patch-clamp detected a cAMP-stimulated Clcurrent in CFBE cells expressing F508del CFTR and USP19. In addition, USP19 decreased F508del CFTR ubiquitination, and this deubiquitinase activity required the catalytically activity of this DUB. Interestingly, USP19 interacted with the small ubiquitin-like modifier, SUMO-1, in CFBE cells and promoted the conjugation of F508del CFTR to SUMO-1, which can increase protein solubility and reduce protein aggregation (2) . We have previously reported that SUMO paralogs can modify CFTR protein both in vitro and in vivo (3) . To explore the role of SUMO modification in USP19-mediated stabilization of mutant CFTR, we evaluated the deubiquitinase activity of USP19 using purified NBD1-F508del protein in vitro. We observed that USP19 did not directly promote deubiquitylation of NBD1-F508del; rather, it promoted the deubiquitylation of NBD1-F508del pre-conjugated to SUMO-2. This SUMO paralog forms SUMO poly-chains that are recognized by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, RNF4, which promotes mutant CFTR degradation by the proteasome (3) . Moreover, mutation of SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) in USP19 prevented its ability to increase F508del CFTR expression and diminished the interaction of USP19 with F508del CFTR in CFBE cells.",

These results suggest that the modification of mutant CFTR by pathways that utilize different SUMO paralogs play competing roles that determine the fates of wild-type and mutant CFTR. They suggest also that SUMO paralogs themselves can recapitulate the actions of the SUMO-2/3/RNF4 pathway for ubiquitin-proteasome degradation vs. the SUMO-1 pathway, which supports CFTR biogenesis.

(Supported by grants from the NIH (DK 068196) and from CF Foundation Therapeutics. The new challenge for cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy is based on the development of small molecules able to rescue the function of CFTR. Many pharmacological agents have been designed to increase the surface level of mutated CFTR (correctors), as well as its plasma membrane (PM) activity (potentiators). Unfortunately, for the most common CF-causing mutation F508del, their efficacy seems to be time-limited mainly due to a reduced stability of corrected protein (Cholon DM, et al.

            "text": "Conclusion: In conclusion, these results support the role of GM1 in the stabilization and function of CFTR at the PM level, suggesting new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CF by the use of GM1. The most common CF-associated mutation, F508del causes defects at the level of CFTR mRNA, protein, and channel function. In addition, TGF-\u03b21 blocks the corrector VX-809-mediated functional rescue of F508del-CFTR in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells homozygous for F508del. TGF-\u03b21 acts upstream of corrector VX-809 because it represses CFTR mRNA by a mechanism dependent on the TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2R)-I and autonomous of epithelial cell de-differentiation. Thus, rescue of the distal F508del-associated defects, at the level of CFTR protein, without correcting the proximal, mRNA repression of F508del-CFTR may limit the in vivo efficacy of corrector/potentiator therapy. While miRNA-145 antagonism was shown to reverse the TGF-\u03b21 mediated rescue of F508del-CFTR, little is known about the mechanisms of TGF-\u03b21 repression of CFTR mRNA. Our previously published data in HBE cells show that the degree of CFTR mRNA inhibition by TGF-\u03b21varied greatly among non-CF controls that included cells from lungs with no disease and COPD. Acquired CFTR dysfunction and elevated TGF-\u03b21 levels were previously reported in COPD. Here, we studied separately HBE cells from CF and COPD lungs procured at the time of transplantation and control lungs with no disease procured from the Center of Organ Recovery and Education (N= 13/group). HBE cells were cultured to full differentiation and TGF-\u03b21 (15 ng/mL) or vehicle control was added to the basolateral medium for 24 hours. While the baseline levels of CFTR mRNA did not differ between the groups, TGF-\u03b21 inhibited CFTR mRNA in cells from COPD lungs similar to CF but had no effect on CFTR in control lungs. These data demonstrate that the disease context modulates TGF-\u03b21effects on CFTR. Work published by several groups including ours, showed that TGF-\u03b21 blocked rescue of F508del-CFTR by corrector VX-809. Recent data demonstrate that the combined use of corrector C18 and CFFT-002 had a superior effect on F508del-CFTR rescue in vitro, compared to a single administration or other small molecules. TGF-\u03b21 blocked the F508del-CF-TR-mediated Cltransport and inhibited ASL volume rescued by correctors C18 and CFFT-002 in CF HBE cells. Together, these data demonstrate that TGF-\u03b21 acts upstream of different small molecule correctors. Next, we examined whether signaling via the canonical TGF-\u03b21 pathway mediates CFTR mRNA repression in CF HBE cells. At baseline, the shRNA mediated depletion of Smad2 (shSmad2) or Smad3 (shSmad3) did not affect CFTR mRNA, compared to the nonsilencing shRNA control. By contrast, shSmad3 accelerated TGF-\u03b21 repression of CFTR mRNA. To study whether the effect was mediated by miRNA-145, we examined the miRNA-145 levels after Smad2 or Smad3 depletion. shSmad3 had a profound inhibitory effect on miRNA-145 at baseline and prevented the TGF-\u03b21-induced upregulation of miRNA-145. These results demonstrate that in CF HBE cells, Smad3 mediates TGF-\u03b21 repression of CFTR mRNA, independent of miRNA-145. In summary, the effects of TGF-\u03b21 on CFTR in HBE cells are modified by the disease background. In CF HBE cells, TGF-\u03b21 inhibits CFTR function rescued by different correctors by a novel mechanism dependent on the canonical mediator, Smad3.",

            "text": "There are over 2,000 mutations reported in the gene encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), most of these cause CF. Interestingly, only a minority of these mutations are found on the luminal/extracellular face. Our group has demonstrated that a novel chaperone of the ER lumen, endoplasmic reticulum protein of 29kDa (ERp29), has increased expression in response to treatment with 4-phenylbutyrate, promotes the normal biogenesis of wild-type (WT) CFTR and corrects aberrant biogenesis of F508del when overexpressed (Suaud L, et al. J Biol Chem. 2011; 286:21239-53) . While ERp29 must interact with CFTR or F508del on the ER-luminal face of the protein, F508 is located on CFTR's cytoplasmic face within its first nucleotide binding domain; cellular trafficking machinery, including coat complex II (COP II) components that mediate CFTR's exit from the ER and transport to the Golgi, also interact with CFTR's cytoplasmic face. We hypothesize that more rare mutations on CFTR's luminal face may cause abnormal channel biogenesis. ERp29 is suggested to interact with -(F, Y)-X-(F, Y)-or -(F, Y)-(F, Y)-motif on client proteins, and CFTR has exactly one such putative ERp29 binding motif on its luminal face that is potentially accessible to a chaperone. This motif, 1014 Y-I-F 1016 , is located in extracellular loop 5 (ECL5), and there are two rare CF-causing mutations of CFTR within this motif, Y1014C and F1016S. Additionally, there are two described disease-causing CFTR mutations at proline 1013 (P1013H and P1013L) that are adjacent to this motif and are likely to cause a change in structure of ECL5, the region including and surrounding 1014 Y-I-F 1016 motif. To test the hypothesis that these mutations in ECL5 inhibit CFTR biogenesis, we expressed these mutant CFTRs in CFBE41o \u2212 CF bronchial epithelial cells. Functional expression of these mutant CFTR, defined as I sc that was inhibited by apical application of 10 \u00b5M CFTRinh-172 after treatment of the cells with 10 \u00b5M forskolin and 100 \u00b5M IBMX and imposition of the basolateral-to-apical chloride gradient in Ussing chambers, was absent. In addition, immunoblots of whole cell lysates of CFBE41o-cells transfected with these mutants demonstrated CFTRs that co-migrated with F508del CFTR and at a lower molecular weight than WT CFTR. These data support the hypothesis that disease-causing CFTR mutations in ECL5 and on CFTR's luminal face inhibit CFTR biogenesis.

We developed a hollow micropillar array method to screen compounds using epithelial cells cultured on a porous support, with the goal of screening thousands of compounds using a single, commercially available 24-mm diameter Transwell filter containing cultured cells. Test compounds (~1 nL) in an alginate hydrogel were microprinted in hollow cylindrical micropillars (height 150 \u00b5m, inner diameter 100 \u00b5m) spaced 300 \u00b5m apart in a square array configuration (see Figure) . Compounds were delivered by positioning the array near the surface of a cell layer, with ~10 \u00b5m distance between the micropillars and cell surface. Compounds were stable in the hydrogel, and efficiently released upon contact with an overlying aqueous solution. Micropillar array geometry, and the viscosity of the hydrogel and overlying solutions, were optimized computationally and experimentally for sustained exposure of cells to test compounds with minimal cross-talk from compounds in neighboring micropillar wells. For proof of concept, a hollow polydimethylsiloxane micropillar array was fabricated to print 100 compounds (10 x 10 micropillar array) in a 3 \u00d7 3 square mm area, in which an ~23 \u00b5m-high rectangular spacer was fabricated to set a ~10 \u00b5m gap between the upper surface of micropillars and the cell layer. CFTR activation by cAMP agonists was measured in CFTR-expressing epithelial cells using a YFP halide indicator. Analysis of iodide quenching curves showed robust detection of CFTR activation with near-zero cross-talk, with a statistical Z'-factor of >0.65. The hollow micropillar array platform developed here should be generalizable to cell monolayers of any type grown on solid or porous supports, and to kinetic or steady-state read-out of an optical signal for enzymes, transporters, receptors or other targets. This approach may be useful for drug screening utilizing small quantity of cells, as in personalized n-of-1 screens using CF patient-derived primary cells.

Two of the five most common CF-causing CFTR mutants world-wide are the nonsense mutation W1282X and missense mutation N1303K. We report here that, in both transfected cell models and primary human airway epithelial cell cultures, combination of a corrector and two potentiators increases chloride current from W1282X-CFTR and N1303K-CFTR by up to 10-fold over that of VX-770 alone. High-throughput \"synergy screens\" done on N1303K and W1282X CFTR, in which >100,000 candidate drugs were tested in combination with VX-770, identified arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine, phenoxy-benzimidazole and flavone co-potentiators. An arylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine co-potentiator (ASP-11) added with VX-770 increased N1303K-CFTR current by 7-fold more than VX-770 alone. ASP-11 with VX-770 increased by ~65% current of G551D-CFTR compared to VX-770 alone, was additive with VX-770 on F508del-CFTR, and activated wild-type CFTR in the absence of a cAMP agonist. ASP-11 efficacy with VX-770 was demonstrated in primary CF human airway cell cultures having N1303K, W1282X and G551D CFTR mutations (see Figure) . Structure-activity studies on synthesized ASP-11 analogs produced co-potentiators with EC 50 down to 500 nM. A remarkable finding was the apparent broad selectivity of co-potentiators for different mutant CFTRs. The co-potentiator approach is being tested on less common missense and nonsense CFTR mutations found in NBD1 and NBD2, including L467P, V520F, A559T, R560T, R1158X, R1162X, 3659delC, W1204X, I1234V and Q1313X. These studies support combination potentiator therapy for CF caused by some CFTR mutations that are not treated effectively by single potentiators. Supported by NIH, CFF, CFRI and Emily's Entourage. Approximately 50% of CF patients are heterozygous with a rare mutation on at least one CFTR allele. It is anticipated that approved and \"next-generation\" CFTR modulators will have therapeutic benefit for most (~90 %) but not all CF patients. We report a personalized CFTR modulator discovery effort involving two siblings that are heterozygous for W1282X and I1234V CFTR mutations. The W1282X mutation, which prematurely truncates CFTR to remove \u223c60% of nucleotide binding domain 2 (NBD2), is most commonly found in the Askhenazi Jewish population. The I1234V mutation is a relatively rare CF-causing variant found mainly in subjects of Middle Eastern origin. This mutation, a base pair substitution, c.3700A>G, produces the missense mutant I1234V-CFTR as well as introducing a splice site that produces a 6 amino acid deletion in NBD2 (p.Ile1234_ Arg1239del)). Human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells were obtained from nasal brushings from both subjects and expanded under conditional reprogramming conditions for testing CFTR modulators. Short-circuit current measurements showed no beneficial effect of the approved correctors VX-809 and VX-661. The potentiator VX-770 increased short-circuit current following addition of forksolin by 1.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 . Remarkably, short-circuit current was increased by \"co-potentiator\" ASP-11 or the flavone apigenin, in the presence of VX-770, to 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 and 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5A/cm 2 , respectively. Comparison of short-circuit current values of similarly cultured non-CF cells (~12-15 \u00b5A/cm 2 ) and VX-809-corrected F508del-CFTR cells (~3-5 \u00b5A/cm 2 ), suggests that co-potentiator therapy in I1234V/W1282X CF subjects restores chloride conductance to ~11-14% of wild-type CFTR activity, which may have therapeutic benefit.

In this work, we found that overexpression of wt ERp29 increased the abundance of the active form of \u03b3-ENaC, as well as ENaC functional expression whereas ERp29 overexpression of a mutant ERp29 lacking its single Cysteine (C157S ERp29) decreased ENaC functional expression. These observations were not associated with altered expression of \u03b2-ENaC at the apical surface, suggesting that ERp29 may modulate ENaC open probability at the apical surface. ERp29 overexpression also promoted the interaction of both ENaC and CFTR with the coat complex II (COP II) ER exit machinery, whereas C157S ERp29 overexpression decreased this interaction. These data suggested a model where ERp29 may promote ENaC cleavage by directing ENaC to the Golgi.",

To test whether this motif is critical for ERp29's regulation of ENaC and CFTR, we designed a mutant ERp29 containing a KDEL retention motif (ERp29 KDEL) that should be better returned to the ER from the proximal Golgi by the KDEL receptor, and a mutant that deleted the KEEL motif that would interact less well with the KDEL receptor (ERp29 \u0394KEEL). ENaC functional expression was decreased by expression of ERp29 \u0394KEEL, while expression of ERp29 KDEL did not elicit any significant effect. As already observed with wt and C157S ERp29 overexpression, \u03b2-ENaC expression at the apical surface was not changed by expression of ERp29 KDEL or \u0394KEEL. We then further investigated CFTR activity and observed that both ERp29 KDEL and \u0394KEEL decreased CFTR functional expression. These data suggest that ERp29's KEEL motif plays a critical role in ENaC and CFTR biogenesis. We therefore tested the hypothesis that this was due to the interaction of this motif with the KDEL receptor, and have preliminarily found that depletion of the KDEL receptor also decreased ENaC processing in the Golgi. Together our findings suggest a key regulatory role for ERp29's association with the KDEL receptor in supporting the biogenesis of CFTR and ENaC, and therefore suggest a role for the KDEL receptor in promoting ENaC biogenesis.",

The 2015 approval of combination therapy with the corrector molecule lumacaftor and potentiator ivacaftor validated modulation of protein biosynthesis as an avenue for pharmacological intervention. These and other drugs now present in combination therapies improve F508del-CFTR folding, increase channel density, and maximize activity at the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, a significant amount of F508del-CFTR is still destroyed by the proteasome through a process known as endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). It has been hypothesized that suppressing this degradation could augment the efficacy of corrector drugs by increasing the foldable pool of F508del-CFTR substrate on which they can act. During ERAD, F508del-CFTR is selected by molecular chaperones, modified with a polyubiquitin chain, and degraded by the proteasome. Prior work indicated that proteasome inhibition fails to rescue F508del-CFTR and instead leads to the accumulation of insoluble, polyubiquitinated protein. More recent studies, however, have shown that disruption of more proximal steps in the ERAD pathway can increase the pool of salvageable CFTR as small-molecule inhibition of ubiquitin activating enzymes synergistically increased F508del-CFTR maturation and activity when combined with chemical correctors (Chung WJ, et al. PLoS ONE. 2016; 11:e0163615) . Here, we sought to precisely target the ubiquitination step in ERAD of mutant CFTR through inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which targets CFTR during both ERAD and the retrieval of F508del-CFTR from the plasma membrane.",

Cell free ubiquitination assays for in vitro CHIP activity identified putative first-in-class CHIP inhibitors. Of these, select hit compounds prevented CHIP ubiquitination of a model substrate with micromolar to millimolar efficacy. One tested compound blunts the ubiquitination of immunopurified F508del-CFTR in vitro. Cellular studies indicate that this molecule stabilizes F508del-CFTR in HEK cells transfected with CFTR bearing plasmid, and prolongs the cellular protein half-life of mutant CFTR. Finally, one putative CHIP inhibitor works synergistically with lumacaftor to prevent proteasomal degradation and enhance F508del-CFTR abundance and maturation. Future efforts are underway to optimize cell free and cellular assay systems, target other druggable sites of CHIP, improve compound efficacy, develop a structure activity relationship for the chemical series identified, and examine compounds in functional assays and in primary lung epithelial cells. These early biochemical studies indicate that suppression of proximal steps in ERAD by chemical inhibition of the CHIP E3 ligase may stabilize CFTR mutant proteins and serve to enhance activity of existing corrector and potentiator compounds to optimize drug therapy for cystic fibrosis.",

The early conformation of each domain in F508del CFTR (directly after synthesis) did not change upon C2a addition, but after 2 hours the assembly of the TMD1, TMD2 and NBD2 domains had improved, which correlated with the increased amount of Golgi form of CFTR (C band).",

Neither TMD1 nor TMD2 showed any change in degradation rate, suggesting that (cell-biological) stability of these individual domains was not influenced by the corrector.

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common, lethal autosomal recessive disorder, and is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), an anion channel that is found in most epithelial cells lining the airway and gut. The most common mutation of CFTR is deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (CFTR \u0394F508), which produces a misfolded protein. Through the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), this misfolded protein is ubiquitinated and signaled for degradation via the cytosolic proteasome. This route of degradation is referred to as the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) system. Previous studies demonstrating experimental restoration of CFTR \u0394F508 trafficking to the plasma membrane showed partial function of the chloride channel, raising therapeutic speculations. Some components of how CFTR \u0394F508 is degraded are known, however many mechanisms that underly its degradation through ERAD and the UPS are still unknown. Through an siRNA library screen of 22 ER resident ubiquitin E3 ligases, we discovered a ubiquitin E3 ligase, ring finger protein 19B (RNF19B), that aids in the degradation of CFTR \u0394F508. We used siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous RNF19B in the CF epithelial cell line cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial \u0394F508 (CFBE \u0394F508) cells to demonstrate that there is a 50% increase in CFTR \u0394F508 expression in these cells. We also created an RNF19B plasmid that was co-expressed with CFTR \u0394F508 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that demonstrated a 2-fold decrease in CFTR \u0394F508 compared to control. This decrease in CFTR \u0394F508 expression was also dose-dependent. Cycloheximide-chase (CHX) experiments using HEK 293 cells overexpressing RNF19B and CFTR \u0394F508 showed that there was a decrease in CFTR \u0394F508 half-life compared to control. Biotinylation experiments using siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous RNF19B in CFBE \u0394F508 cells that were treated with VX-809 demonstrated an increase in mature form of CFTR at the plasma membrane compared to control. A catalytically nonfunctioning RNF19B RING mutant was unable to promote CFTR \u0394F508 degradation. Lastly, using siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous RNF19B in CFBE \u0394F508 cells increased forskolin-stimulated short-circuit currents compared to control. Interestingly, there seemed to be cooperatively larger increases in short-circuit currents when the CFBE \u0394F508 cells that were silenced with RNF19B were treated for 24 hours with VX-809. Taken together, these data suggest that there is an additional mechanism where the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF19b is responsible for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the misfolded CFTR \u0394F508.",

Upon differentiation, both formed pseudostratified epithelia expressing tight junction associated ZO-1, embedded with Muc5AC producing goblet cells and acetylated tubulin expressing ciliated cells, with an overall transepithelial resistance of ~500 \u03a9*cm 2 . To assess the electrophysiological characteristics of CR-HNE, cells from five individuals with CFTR WT/WT genotype were collected and upon differentiation, their CFTR function was determined by short-circuit current (I sc ) measurement and compared to that of CR-HBE. While the PKA activator forskolin-stimulated CFTR I sc was ~40% lower in CR-HNE than in CR-HBE, likely due to reduced CFTR expression in nasal epithelia, the cAMP sensitivity and fractional potentiator-independent current were similar between CR-HNE and CR-HBE. The functional phenotype of CR-HNE was stable for ~10 passages as indicated by the comparable amiloride-inhibited ENaC and PKA-stimulated, CFTR inh -172-sensitive current densities at passages 3, 6 and 10. Furthermore, CR-HBE and CR-HNE each isolated from 3 patients with CFTR F508del/F508del genotype exhibited similar correction upon treatment with the folding corrector VX-809, resulting in CFTR function corresponding to 24.1 \u00b1 4.7% and 25.1 \u00b1 1.5% of the matching wild-type epithelia currents.",

Although with the use of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (LUMA/IVA), modest but significant improvement in pulmonary function and a reduction in pulmonary exacerbations occurs, there is no established link with changes in infections. To better understand whether increased CFTR activity would alter the nature of infections in CF patients, we carried out an observational study in a Northern Italian CF Centre. A total of 42 CF patients, 12 years of age or older, who were homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation, received LUMA/IVA; we studied the 14 patients, who had been taking LUMA/IVA for at least 2 years (3 years in 8 subjects) with particular regard to their airways infections before and after treatment. Pulmonary exacerbations significantly decreased from baseline (from 4.29\u00b10.54 to 2.43\u00b10.40 after 1 year (p<0.05) and to 1.91\u00b10.39 after 2 years (p<0.01)). Improvement after 3 years of treatment was not significant (from baseline 3.75\u00b10.82 to 2.13\u00b10.35). Pulmonary function (FEV 1 percent predicted) improved from baseline but not significantly (from 59.4\u00b15.3 to 62.6.7\u00b15.7 after 1 year and to 65.2\u00b16.4 after 2 years, and from baseline 67.5\u00b14.9 to 77.0\u00b14.5 after 3 years). Body mass index increased from 21.02\u00b10.51 at baseline to 21.83\u00b10.63 after 1 year and to 21.86\u00b10.56 after 2 years, and from 20.64\u00b10.57 baseline to 22.33\u00b10.76 after 3 years. With regard to sputum microbiology the majority of patients included in this study were infected by Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at the time of enrollment (64%). Additional species were also present with Achromobacter xyloxidans (36%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29%), Aspergillus fumigatus (21%), methicillin resistant (MR) SA (21%), and Haemophilus influenzae (14%) being the most abundant. After the first and second year of treatment, no significant change in microbiological isolation was observed: MSSA (50% after 1 year vs 50% after 2 years), P. aeruginosa (29% after 1 year vs 21% after 2 years), H. influenza Approximately 10% of disease-causing mutations in CFTR result in a nonsense mutation or premature termination codon (PTC), which results in a truncated and usually nonfunctional CFTR protein. During protein synthesis, these stop codons terminate protein translation as they enter the ribosome A site and interact with eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1/3). Sequence context, regulatory components, and small molecules can alter the balance of translation termination and translational readthrough, and therefore have implications for treating nonsense mutations. Understanding how translation termination occurs is therefore important for developing effective nonsense therapies. In this study, we used ribosome profiling to monitor the process of translation termination by obtaining a high-resolution and quantitative profile of actively translating ribosomes across the entire cellular transcriptome (~18,000 and ~16,000 transcripts in human and rat cells, respectively). Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (footprints) were isolated and sequenced by next-generation sequencing from HEK293 and/or FRT cells prior to and after treatment with an aminoglycoside analog (G418) or a candidate PTC readthrough small molecule (CFF-910), which was identified in a high-throughput screen (Southern Research Institute). Our results revealed that translation termination at native stop codons occurs in two successive and distinct steps. The first occurred as the stop codon entered the ribosome A site, suggesting that the ribosome pauses as eRF1/3 interacts with the stop codon. The second pause occurred as the stop codon translocates from the A site to the P site of the ribosome, and then presumably triggers ribosome disassembly. G418 reduced ribosome occupancy at both pause sites and increased ribosomes present on the 3'UTR consistent with active translational readthrough. In contrast, CFF-910 showed a summative increase of ribosome occupancy only at the first pause site, and 3'UTR footprints lost periodicity consistent with a frame shift-associated readthrough mechanism. These results suggest that G418 and CFF-910 have distinct mechanisms of action on translation termination, with G418 allowing readthrough by near-cognate tRNAs, whereas CFF-910 prolongs ribosome pausing at the stop codon and enables readthrough with out-of-frame translation. Supported by CFF.",

Physiology Department, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA; 2. CFFT Lab, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Theraputics, Lexington, MA, USA; 3. Physiology, RFUMS, Chicago, IL, USA; 4. Genetics, JHMI, Baltimore, MD, USA Hundreds of variants of the CFTR gene have been observed in people with CF. However, experimental evidence for pathogenicity is available for only a fraction of these variants. Moreover, there is a dearth of information regarding the molecular pathology and responsiveness to small molecule therapeutics for the vast majority of the variants. Recent FDA decisions for label extensions based on in vitro functional data highlight the potential value of more data on these poorly understood variants. To fill this gap, we initiated a program to assess 649 putative disease-associated CFTR missense variants, both functionally and biochemically, in a blinded fashion, at three independent sites. The results document those variants: i) likely to be disease-causing due to a lack of function, ii) likely to be benign polymorphisms, iii) that interfere with the folding and maturation of CFTR, iv) that respond to acute treatment with a CFTR potentiator (ivacaftor) and v) that respond to pretreatment with a CFTR corrector (lumacaftor). Our presentation will summarize the progress to date. fibrosis patients carry a PTC on at least one CFTR allele. Translation of a PTC-containing mRNA terminates at the PTC, producing a truncated, usually nonfunctional, polypeptide. PTC suppression therapy utilizes small molecules that suppress translation termination at a PTC to restore synthesis of a full-length polypeptide. PTC suppression, also termed readthrough, is mediated by the base pairing of a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA with a PTC and subsequently, its associated amino acid becomes incorporated into the nascent polypeptide at the site of the PTC. However, little is known about the identity of the amino acid(s) inserted at a PTC during readthrough, how the surrounding sequence context influences amino acid incorporation, why certain near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs are preferred, or the functionality of full-length CFTR protein generated by readthrough.",

There are over 2000 mutations associated with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and approximately 280 of the mutations have been confirmed to cause CF. These mutations can be divided into six different defect classes that may be amendable to a precision medicine approach wherein a given mutation class may be addressed using its own therapeutic intervention approach. The deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) is the most prevalent mutation among CF patients, with over 85% of patients carrying at least one allele. The F508del mutation impairs the conformational maturation of the protein which attenuates the trafficking of CFTR to the apical surface of bronchial cells of the lungs. Pharmacological chaperones known as correctors can partially rescue this trafficking phenotype, and the early first-to-market correctors, such as lumacaftor (VX-809) and tezacaftor (VX-661), when combined with a potentiator, have been demonstrated to confer only a modest clinical benefit to CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal genetic disease caused by insufficient activity of the chloride channel Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). The predominant cause of death in CF is lung failure due to persistent bacterial infection and inflammation of the airways. Interestingly, many of the bacteria common in CF airways secrete the enzyme sphingomyelinase (SMase), which degrades membrane sphingomyelin into phosphocholine and ceramide. Our lab has shown that bacterial SMase applied to the basolateral side inhibits forskolin-activated chloride currents in bronchial epithelial cells from patients (hBEs) (Stauffer BB, et al. Sci Rep. 2017; 7:2931) . This experimental setup precludes a direct interaction between SMase and the hBE chloride channels (CFTR and TMEM16A), since these channels are apical and SMase was applied basolaterally. Furthermore, confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that the sphingomyelin abundance at the apical membrane remained unaltered upon basolateral SMase treatment, indicating that a change in the lipidic environment immediately surrounding these apical chloride channels is unlikely. Still a few mechanisms remain to explain the SMase-mediated inhibition of chloride currents in these cells: 1.) SMase inhibits a basolateral transporter, reducing the chloride influx and thus the efflux; 2.) SMase initiates a signaling cascade leading to an inhibitory modification on apically-located CFTR, TMEM16A, or both; or 3.) SMase initiates a signaling cascade resulting in a reduction in the surface expression of CFTR, TMEM16A, or both. The work herein attempts to determine the basis of SMase-mediated inhibition of chloride currents. To complete this goal, we will utilize hBEs and an immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line in the Ussing chamber to monitor transepithelial current and resistance. Furthermore, we will use various pharmacological activators and inhibitors to isolate CFTR current from TMEM16A current. Lastly, we will use cell-surface biotinylation pull downs to quantify a change in CFTR and/or TMEM16A membrane expression. Deriving the mechanism by which SMase inhibits chloride currents in hBEs is important, as it will inform how bacterial virulence factors may need to be targeted to prevent further inhibition of the already deficient CFTR chloride current to improve treatment for CF patients.

F508del -deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at position 508is the most common lethal mutation found in CF patients. Fully synthesized F508del-CFTR is rapidly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum due to F508del-induced misfolding, preventing proper transport of the protein to the epithelial cell membrane. Previously, we have demonstrated that F508del facilitates partial unfolding and consequent aggregation of the first nucleotide-binding domain in human CFTR (hNBD1). This F508delfacilitated aggregation is likely a key contributor to F508del-CF pathogenesis. These findings established a foundation to develop a new highthroughput biophysical screen to identify compounds that directly bind to the hNBD1 domain to prevent the F508del-hNBD1 aggregation in vitro and thereby stabilize F508del-CFTR in vivo. Therefore, we first constructed an isolated hNBD1 that covalently binds to a visible fluorophore at a single labeling site through conjunction reaction between maleimide group of fluorophore and cysteine residue from the protein. Thermal fluorescence self-quenching (tFSQ) of this labeled domain upon unfolding/aggregation provides a robust and accurate high-throughput assay for corrector compounds. We demonstrated several thymidine nucleotide analogs bind ~3-fold tighter than ATP, the physiological ligand of hNBD1. These thymidine analogs offset half of the defect in thermal stability in F508del-hNBD1 and preserve the gating function of F508del-hCFTR channels at 37\u00b0C where ATP cannot, showing thymidine analogs merit further exploration as cystic fibrosis drugs.",

Hence, we engineered a cys-reduced whole hCFTR protein for single-site fluorophore labeling. Similar to isolated hNBD1, the fluorescently-labeled hCFTR provides a strong and reproducible tFSQ signal showing that thymidine also stabilizes the full-length hCFTR more strongly than ATP. This system provides an unprecedented opportunity to characterize thermodynamic and dynamic interactions between the domains in CFTR and is suitable to perform high-throughput screening for compounds directly stabilizing full-length hCFTR in vitro. subject to regulation by phosphorylation dependent (by cAMP and cGMP dependent kinases) and phosphorylation independent (by glutamate) mechanisms in the human sweat duct (Reddy, Quinton, 2003) . We have therefore asked how these different regulatory mechanisms are affected by different CFTR mutations. In addition, we have recently reported (Madireddy R, et.al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017; 52(S47) :214 [abstract] ) that CFTR potentiator, VX-770 acutely increased CFTR mediated HCO 3 conductance only in normal but not in CF sweat ducts expressing \u0394F508/nonsense mutations (G542X or W1282X). Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the role of alternative mechanisms of stimulating CFTR-HCO 3 conductance in sweat ducts expressing different mutant forms of CFTR. We studied the role of phosphorylation dependent and independent mechanisms of CFTR mediated HCO 3 permeability in normal CF ducts using electrophysiological techniques on freshly isolated, \u03b1-toxin permeabillized and microperfused human sweat ducts (Reddy, Quinton, 2003) . Our general experimental protocol included perfusion of the cytoplasmic bath with 140 mM KGlu while changing the composition of the luminal perfusate from Glu -(gluconate) to HCO 3 -. We have then followed the acute effects of cytosolic application of cAMP, cGMP (10 -5 M each) and glutamate metabolite \u03b1-ketoglutarate (1mM) in the presence of 5mM ATP on transepithelial HCO 3 conductance relative to the impermeant anion Glu -. These studies were conducted on sweat ducts from wild-type and the heterozygote CF ducts expressing \u0394F508/R117H (n=2 subjects and 8 ducts) and \u0394F508/3849 (n=1 subject and 3 ducts) mutant forms of CFTR. Preliminary data indicated that under the experimental conditions cAMP and cGMP together and \u03b1-ketoglutarate independently (in the presence of ATP) could stimulate CFTR mediated HCO 3 conductance in wild-type ducts. However, only \u03b1-ketoglutarate+ATP could stimulate \u0394F508/R117H and \u0394F508/5849 heterozygote CF ducts that were incubated overnight with CFTR corrector VX-809 (3mM). These results indicated that the efficacy of different agonists in stimulating aberrant CFTR-mediated HCO 3 - conductance appears to be selectively compromised by different CFTR mutations in stimulating HCO 3 - conductance. In conclusion, these preliminary results suggest that glutamate regulation of CFTR-HCO 3 conductance is relatively unaffected by certain CFTR mutations. These observations further emphasize the need for identifying mutant specific CFTR agonists that can be selectively used for restoring aberrant CFTR mediated HCO 3 conductance affected by different CFTR mutations.",

Knockdown and overexpression of RNF19B have decreased and increased CFTR \u0394F508 degradation, respectively. RNF19B directly interacts with CFTR \u0394F508. In this study, as a result of screening 34 ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzymes, we found that UBE2L6 is one of several enzymes related to CFTR \u0394F508 degradation. Overexpression of UBE2L6 increased CFTR \u0394F508 degradation by 2-3-fold. Knockdown of UBE2L6 by siRNA or overexpression of a UBE2L6 dominant-negative mutant substantially decreased CFTR \u0394F508 degradation. We further demonstrated that UBE2L6 is physically associated with RNF19B. Moreover, silencing UBE2L6 expression increased VX-809-mediated CFTR \u0394F508 maturation. Finally, siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous UBE2L6 in the CF epithelial cell line CFTR-\u0394F increased forskolin-stimulated short-circuit currents compared to control. There was a greater increase in short-circuit currents when UBCE2L6 silenced cells were treated with VX-809. In summary, we unveil a novel E2 enzyme that cooperates with RNF19B to target misfolded CFTR \u0394F508 for ERAD. This study presents a novel therapeutic strategy to synergistically restore the function of CFTR \u0394F508.",

We have previously established planar nasal epithelial cultures (PNECs) from nasal brushings for personalized CFTR function measurements in Ussing chambers and quantified CFTR potentiator responses to ivacaftor in three CF individuals including F508del/1154insTC, F508del/Y563N, and splice variant 3849+10kbC->T/G542X that correlated with a decrease in sweat chloride concentration in a small N-of-1 trial (McGarry ME, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017; 52:472-9) . The goal of this study was to determine the unknown responses to CFTR-targeted therapies for two CF patients carrying the rare F508del/S1159P (c.3475 T->C; pSer1159Pro) or ultrarare F508del/c.850dupA genotype. The S1159P mutation, a thymine-to-cytosine nucleotide replacement in exon 22 at nucleotide 3475 of the CFTR gene is known to cause a serine-to-proline exchange at amino acid 1159, right before the second nucleotide-binding domain, however the functional impact of the S1159P mutation on CFTR activity is unknown. The c.850dupA mutation is caused by a duplication of an adenine at nucleotide position 850 in exon 6 that presumably leads to termination of CFTR translation at the end of the 4th membrane spanning region in the first transmembrane domain. Currently only one CF patient is known with the F508del/c.850dupA genotype. We determined the level of basal CFTR activity and response to CFTR correctors lumacaftor; tezacaftor) and CFTR potentiator (VX-770, ivacaftor) by using patient-derived cells from nasal brushings. PNECs were generated by conditional reprogramming techniques and used at passage 1. Functional activity of apical F508del/S1159P or F508del/c.850dupA CFTR proteins was assessed by measuring acute responses to forskolin and VX-770 (1 \u00b5M) followed by CFTR inhibitor172 (50 \u00b5M) without or with overnight CFTR corrector treatment (VX-809, VX-661; 3 \u00b5M) with the Ussing assay.",

Imaging revealed a 9x8 mm cystic mass in the pancreatic head. Pathology results from a FNA showed atypical ductal epithelium concerning for malignancy. He underwent a Whipple with jejunostomy. Biopsy results were consistent with chronic pancreatitis without malignancy. Several months later, the patient decided to undergo genetic testing for chronic pancreatitis with the Ariel Precision Medicine Lab. He was found to have 3 CFTR and 2 CASR variants that increased his risk of pancreatitis. His sweat chloride testing results put him in the intermediate risk category for CF. Given his fertility, lack of pulmonary symptoms and normal spirometry, he was diagnosed with CF-related disorder, explaining the etiology of his recurrent acute pancreatitis.",

Exocrine function is the most reliable phenotypic marker with up to 85% of CF patients developing pancreatic insufficiency. Because the presence of acinar tissue is necessary for the development of pancreatitis, the majority of pancreatic-insufficient CF patients do not experience pancreatitis. Within the population of pancreatic-sufficient CF patients, only 10-20% develop pancreatitis. Ledder and coworkers speculate that CFTR and non-CFTR genotypes as well as environmental factors contribute greatly to the development of pancreatitis in these patients (J Gastroenterol Hepatol.. 2014; 29:1954-62) . Determining which genetic mutations can lead to pancreatic disease without true CF has been challenging. LaRusch and coworkers isolated several of these mutations and hypothesized that particular mutations can cause isolated disruptions in bicarbonate secretion through CFTR, leading to complications such as pancreatitis while preserving normal pulmonary function. This patient tested positive for R75Q, one of 9 mutations studied by LaRusch et al and found to be associated with pancreatitis but not true CF. This mechanism is thought to hinge on regulation of WNK1-SPAK activity. The WNK1-SPAK pathway is activated in conditions of low-intracellular chloride, increasing the permeability of the channel for bicarbonate. All 9 variants in the study lead to defective WNK1-SPAK activity, implying that increased intracellular bicarbonate concentrations within the pancreas could lead to higher risk of pancreatitis (PLoS Genetics. 2014; 10(7) :e1004376).",

Loss of MT stability impairs intracellular transport, initiating a signaling cascade believed to contribute significantly to inflammatory responses in CF. These findings suggest that some aspect of cAMP regulation is disrupted in CF cells. Given reports of a CF-like phenotype in patients with a carbonic anhydrase (CA) deficiency, we hypothesized aberrant regulation of CA could be the link between CFTR dysfunction and these cell signaling alterations via soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), a bicarbonate sensor and producer of cAMP.

We now show that the mucus bundles were essentially stationary in the newborn CF piglets as well as in WT when bicarbonate was removed from the bathing solution. The cholinergic system is important for respiratory physiology as the vagus nerve uses acetylcholine to increase airway smooth muscle tone, submucosal gland secretion and ciliary beat frequency at the same time as it inhibits surface liquid absorption. Increased cholinergic tonus is common in asthma and COPD and the muscarinic inhibitor ipratropium bromide is used for pharmacological treatment of COPD in particular. The use of this treatment is rather counterintuitive except for its inhibitory effect on bronchoconstriction. However, the quick effect of acetylcholine to stop the transport of mucus bundles suggests another and novel mechanism that could explain some of the beneficial effect of anti-cholinergic treatment. Our results further suggest that mucus bundle movement is controlled by attachment-detachment of the mucus bundles to the surface goblet cells. Background: Mucus is critical for the respiratory mucociliary transport defense system, and in large airways, submucosal glands produce most of the mucus. Mucus emerges from submucosal glands to form long strands. However, the function of mucus strands in moving inhaled particles has remained uncertain. We studied newborn pigs to test the hypothesis that movement of large particles requires mucus in the form of strands.",

Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA Introduction: Cycles of injury and incomplete repair brought on by chronic inflammation and infections elicit structural and functional defects termed remodeling in the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelium. Remodeling precipitates disease phenotypes and progression, but cellular targets and molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. We propose that defects in the basal stem cell population (BCs) cause epithelial remodeling. We show that BCs incur long-lasting damage in CF (\"BC injury\"), and differentiate into a remodeled epithelium in vitro (\"BC dysfunction\"). BC injury may stem from global epigenetic alterations eliciting transcriptional changes that lead to reduced self-renewal and differentiation, and/or depletion of specific BC subtypes with self-renewal and/or differentiation potential in the progenitor pool.",

CF Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA; 3. Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: The airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are chronically inflamed, due in part to unrelenting recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from blood into the airways. Prior studies by our group showed that PMNs recruited to the CF airway lumen acquire a pathological phenotype featuring active elastase-rich granule release, acquisition of immunoregulatory activities, and metabolic licensing (dubbed \"GRIM\" PMNs). Recently, we showed that GRIM PMNs can be produced in vitro by transmigrating blood PMNs toward CF sputum supernatant (CF SSN) through a small airway epithelium (Forrest OA, et al. J Leukoc Biol. 2018; doi:10 .1002/JLB.5HI1117-454RR).

Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; 2. School of Immunology, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland Introduction: CF lung disease is characterized by persistent, aggressive neutrophilic inflammation. The key functions of neutrophils require energy. ATP is the building block of energy. Glucose can be used to fuel ATP production through two linked metabolic pathways: glycolysis and the TCA cycle. In most cases, the TCA cycle is responsible for aerobic metabolism, while glycolysis is responsible for anaerobic metabolism. However, under certain circumstances, cell metabolism can shift towards a state of aerobic glycolysis. This metabolic reprogramming phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, has been shown in cancer cells predominantly, but also in inflammatory cells such as macrophages (Palsson-McDermott EM, et al. Cell Metab. 2015; 21:65-80) and results in increased HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcription. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 is transcribed by HIF-1\u03b1 as pro-IL-1\u03b2, a precursor protein that undergoes cleavage to its active form, typically by inflammasome-driven caspase-1 activity.",

H\u00f4pital Trousseau, Paediatric Respiratory Department, Paris, France Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease in the Caucasian population, caused by CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene mutations. CFTR encodes a chloride channel, which is essential for the osmotic balance of airway surface liquid and mucus clearance. The most common mutation is F508del, resulting in the lack of the channel at the apical membrane and leading to an ionic imbalance and a thickened mucus. Hyperviscosity resulting leads to an impaired mucociliary clearance promoting bacterial colonization and establishment of infection/inflammation cycles, which in the long term degrade the pulmonary epithelium. Chronic inflammation is the hallmark of CF lung disease. Indeed, a polynuclear neutrophil invasion and an interleukin-8 (IL-8) hypersecretion were reported in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, sputum and in primary airway epithelial cells of CF patients. Whereas the origin of inflammation is still discussed, previous works have demonstrated that this chronic inflammation is mainly caused by the alteration of the NF-\u03baB pathway (Tabary O, et al. Am J Pathol. 1998; 153:921-30.) which can be regulated by microRNA (miR). MicroRNAs are a class of noncoding small RNA, which most often bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of target genes mRNAs and thereby repress their translation and/or induce their degradation and are little studied in cystic fibrosis.",

Airway acidification contributes to several airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis. In the current study, we examined the effects of acute airway acidification on mucus secretion and transport properties in neonatal male and female piglets. Acute airway acidification induced glycoprotein obstruction of the intrapulmonary airways in both sexes, suggesting a defect in either the secretion or transport properties of mucus. Thus, we examined mucus secretion in response to methacholine ex vivo using lectins. The pattern of mucus secretion was profoundly different in acid-challenged piglets compared to saline-treated controls. Notable differences included a greater expulsion of surface mucus and increased number of mucus strands. Significant dilation of the submucosal gland duct was also observed. We also examined mucus transport properties in submerged tracheas using fluorescent nanospheres. Computer-assisted tracking revealed a decrease in the mean speed of fluorescent particle movement. These findings suggest that acute airway acidification modifies mucus behavior and provide further insight into cystic fibrosis pathogenesis and disease progression.",

RCSI, Dublin, Ireland Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterised by dysregulated ion transport that promotes chronic bacterial infection and inflammation. In addition, CF patients have an intrinsic unbalance between pro-inflammatory lipid mediators such as LTB4 and specialised proresolution mediators (SPM) that are biosynthesised by lipoxygenases (LO) . In this study, the roles of SPMs, lipoxin (LXA4) and resolvin (RvD1) were investigated on epithelial ion transport and innate defence in CF airways. Furthermore, the impact of CFTR mutation was investigated on LO expression, localisation and activity.",

University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is a gram-negative pathogen responsible for a variety of opportunistic infections. In the airway, the bacterium uses a wide array of toxins and virulence factors to evade host immunity and cause disease in patients with respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pa has been shown to reduce mucociliary clearance in airway epithelial cells by altering the trafficking of CFTR, an ion channel that helps maintain chloride levels in epithelial cells (MacEachran DP, et al. Infect Immunol. 2007; 75(8) :3902). Reduction in CFTR-mediated chloride secretion leads to a widening of the mucus layer and an increase in bacterial and fungal infections. Our collaborators determined that the reduction of apical CFTR levels is caused by a specific virulence factor known as the CFTR inhibitory factor (Cif). Cif is an epoxide hydrolase (EH) secreted from Pa that negatively affects ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such as CFTR, transporter associated with antigen presentation 1 (TAP1), and p-glycoprotein, by altering their intracellular trafficking (Bomberger JM, et al. J Biol Chem. 2014; 289:152; Ye S, et al. J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2008; 295:C807-18) . In airway epithelial cells, Cif causes a reduction in apical CFTR levels by inhibiting ubiquitin specific protease 10 (USP10)-mediated deubiquitination of CFTR. Ubiquitinated CFTR signals for degradation which leads to a decrease of CFTR in recycling endosomes and an increase of CFTR in late endosomes fated for the lysosome. Further work demonstrated that Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) regulates USP10 activity and that Cif promotes complex formation between these two proteins which renders USP10 inactive (Bomberger JM, et al. PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7(3) :e1001325). Taken together, these data show that Pa utilizes a novel virulence factor to dysregulate host protein trafficking to promote colonization in the airways. We are currently leveraging our understanding of Cif's enzymatic activity to further explore how epoxides and epoxide hydrolysis are needed for the Cif-mediated CFTR degradation. Through the use of Cif mutants that disrupt catalysis, substrate binding, and substrate specificity, we are gaining a better understanding of how Cif affects the various stages in the CFTR lifecycle. Simultaneously, we are using a biophysical approach to determine how the USP10:G3BP1 complex is formed and regulated. Specifically, we have used biophysical and biochemical assays to elucidate how this complex is formed and regulated in the context of Cif exposure. These data demonstrate that Cif causes more than just CFTR degradation and Cif is affecting other proteins and pathways in epithelial cells. This work opens new areas of exploration on this unique and novel Pa virulence factor.",

Approximately 50% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have hyper-reactive airways and many of these patients are refractory to traditional bronchodilator therapy (3) . Long-term bronchodilator therapy with \u03b2 2 -agonists in CF is controversial and has shown inconsistent results in treatment of airway hyper-reactivity in patients with CF (3) . Activation of TAS2R agonists increases intracellular calcium leading to ASM relaxation. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has been detected in sarcoplasmic reticulum in CF and non-CF newborn pigs. In CF piglets, the loss of CFTR function is associated with abnormal calcium signaling and increased airway reactivity (4) . The purpose of this study was to evaluate TAS2R agonists on ASM cells reactivity comparing CF and non-CF models. Our hypothesis was CF models will exhibit enhanced relaxation to TAS2R agonists on ASM cells compared to non-CF cells.",

Measurement of PL acidification with pH-sensitive fluorophores lacks spatial resolution and may not be truly ratiometric (Nunes P. J Vis Exp. 2015;e53402). Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)-based nanosensors are a novel alternative to analyse pH in living cells. We have used nanosensors consisting of a gold nanoparticle (NP) functionalised with the pH-sensing molecule para-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA). p-MBA molecules change structure in response to H + ion concentration, which is enhanced by exciting the NP at their plasmon resonance of 785 nm, allowing Raman spectra to be acquired and analysed from individual NPs.",

Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; 3. Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA Introduction: Lung macrophages are the major cells involved in the pulmonary innate immune response. In the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, the inability of lung macrophages to successfully regulate the inflammatory response suggests a dysfunctional innate immune system. Various studies have revealed numerous physiological defects associated with CF macrophages including: dysregulation of phagocytic / signaling receptors (Simonin-LeJeune K, et al. PLoS One. 2013; 8(9) :e75667), hyper-responsiveness to microbial stimuli (Bruscia EM, et al. J Immunol. 2011; 186(12) :6990), and impairment in removal of apoptotic cells (Vandivier RW, et al. J Clin Invest. 2002; 109(5) :661). Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene function caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence (Wu C, et al. Science. 2001; 293(5532):1103) . Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as modulators of host defenses that can lead to a more prominent immune response and shape the course of inflammation in the host, both driving the production of specific inflammatory mediators and controlling the magnitude of the host response (Morandini AC, et al. Pathog Dis. 2016; 74 (7)). The most widely studied of the epigenetic modifications is DNA methylation (Marsit CJ, et al. Epigenetics. 2015; 10(8) :708). In this study, we aim to gain insight into innate immune cell dysfunction in CF by investigating alterations in DNA methylation in lung macrophages of CF subjects.",

Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; 2. Center for Lung Biology, Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA Introduction:Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infections are a driver of progressive lung decline in CF. Recurrent and chronic infections contribute to increased inflammation, subjecting the lung to host-mediated tissue damage. Unfortunately, restoration of CFTR function does not eliminate chronic bacterial colonization in the lung, and initial attempts to eradicate infection after restoring CFTR function have not been successful. Anti-inflammatory strategies to reduce deleterious lung inflammation without compromising host-defense mechanisms may be therapeutically beneficial and will likely be a long-term need in CF. Macrophages are innate immune cells with dichotomous roles in controlling inflammatory responses, and CFTR dysfunction results in increased pro-inflammatory macrophage responses, in part due to over-activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. My studies discovered that MEK1/2 is a central regulator of macrophage inflammatory and functional responses. MEK1/2 inhibitors are FDA-approved compounds used in certain cancer chemotherapeutic regimens and recent investigations indicate these compounds have potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory/immune modulating properties.",

PAN-selective inhibition of PDE4s has been shown to stimulate CFTR activity in airway epithelial cells and is well established to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in sterile models of lung inflammation. However, PAN-selective inhibition of PDE4 enzymes also induces a number of side effects including emesis, nausea, diarrhea and weight loss. These gastrointestinal side effects are strongly contraindicated for a CF therapeutic, given that patients suffer from pancreatic insufficiency and intestinal problems and that gaining and maintaining body weight is already a challenge and is strongly associated with health outcomes in CF. The PDE4 family comprises four genes or subtypes, PDE4A-D. As each plays unique and non-overlapping physiological roles in the body, targeting individual PDE4 subtypes may serve to separate therapeutically beneficial ones from the side effects of the nonselective PDE4 inhibitors available to date. To this end, we assessed the effects of genetic ablation of PDE4A, PDE4B and PDE4D in a mouse model of acute lung infection with P. aeruginosa.",

In a second set of experiments, we then assessed lung infection/inflammation in PDE4BKO mice and wild type littermate controls. Preliminary data show that at 16 hours post-infection, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, as well as the bacterial load are reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue of PDE4B knockout mice compared to their wild-type controls.

Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA; 3. Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, USA Introduction: Macrophages play a critical role in clearing bacterial lung infections. In response to bacterial infections, macrophages migrate into the lungs where they phagocytose and kill bacteria and release inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. However, in cystic fibrosis (CF), macrophages exhibit a reduced ability to kill P. aeruginosa and manifest increased cytokine secretion compared to non-CF macrophages. Several reports have demonstrated that CFTR is expressed in macrophages and the bactericidal activity of macrophages is defective in CF. CFTR correction increases bacterial phagocytosis and killing in CF macrophages. Macrophages also play an important role in maintaining iron homeostasis, which may be clinically relevant in CF since increased iron enhances P. aeruginosa growth. CFTR mutations alter iron sequestration in CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBEs; Moreau-Marquis S, et al. Am J Phys Lung Cell Mol Phys. 2008; 295:L25-37) . Disruption of nutritional immunity pathways in CFBEs may contribute to P. aeruginosa survival via increased biofilm formation (Hendricks MR, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 2016; 113:1642-7) . The impact of CF on human macrophage nutritional immunity remains unknown. We hypothesized that CF macrophages have altered expression of iron regulatory proteins and this protein expression can be modulated by CFTR correction.",

To identify drug targets that could be regulated to achieve this, we have utilised a 3D culture model of the human airway epithelium, \"bronchospheres.\" Bronchospheres are derived from primary human airway basal cells, and can be cultured to form a well-differentiated mucociliary epithelium without the need for an air-liquid interface. Bronchospheres are cultured in a 384-well assay format that makes them amenable to medium throughput screening. Treating bronchospheres with mediators such as IL-13 induces a mucus hypersecretory phenotype with increased numbers of goblet cells and reduced numbers of ciliated cells. Our hypothesis was that the co-administration of test compounds together with IL-13 would identify compounds capable of preventing goblet cell formation with the opportunity to seed future drug discovery programs.",

A library of approximately 2,000 pharmacologically active low molecular weight compounds was used, each with a well-annotated mechanism of action. On day 8, media and treatments were topped-up and on day 14 bronchospheres were lysed and RNA isolated. QPCR was then used to assess the expression of cell-specific markers: MUC5AC (goblet cells) and FOXJ1 (ciliated cells). Compounds that induced a \u22652-fold reduction in expression of MUC5AC were classified as hits. This hit list was then refined by checking the expression of FOXJ1. Compounds that had likewise attenuated FOXJ1 expression by \u22652-fold were deprioritised as these likely represented a nonspecific effect on epithelial differentiation. Compounds that either maintained or enhanced FOXJ1 expression in addition to repressing MUC5AC gene expression were prioritised for validation using traditional air-liquid interface cultures.",

MPO, which constitutes 30% of the dry weight of neutrophils, catalyzes the generation of hypochlorous acid (i.e. bleach) from hydrogen peroxide and chloride ion to kill pathogenic microorganisms. In cystic fibrosis, neutrophils are recruited to the lungs in response to infection with pathogenic bacteria, like P. aeruginosa, and release MPO. The MPO then catalyzes the generation of hypochlorous acid damaging the delicate lung tissue in an unsuccessful attempt to eradicate pathogenic bacteria.",

This is consistent with our prior findings that PIC1 can inhibit MPO oxidative activity in vitro and in CF sputum samples ex vivo.

Acknowledgment: Supported by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation CUNNIO17I0. is an important part of airway innate defense and is impaired in CF subjects and CF animal models. Previously, we found that MCC velocity (MCCV) was synergistically increased by combining a low dose of carbachol (a Ca 2+ agonist) and forskolin (a cAMP agonist) in ex vivo ferret tracheas (Joo NS, et al. Sci Rep. 2016; 6:36806) . One possible mechanism for synergistic increases in MCCV is synergistic increases in secretion from submucosal glands, produced by low dose carbachol added to forskolin (Choi JY, et al. J Clin Invest. 2007; 117:3118-27 and Joo NS, et al. J Clin Invest. 2010; 120:3161-6) . As one test of this hypothesis, we asked if synergistic increases in MCCV could be produced in rabbit tracheas, which lack airway submucosal glands.",

The major physiological agonist of the CFTR chloride channel is the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a 28-amino acid neuropeptide that functions as a neuromodulator and neurotransmitter. It is secreted by intrinsic neurons innervating exocrine glands and regulating their secretions. VIP is also a potent vasodilator and bronchodilator. Furthermore it has immunoregulatory activity, and stimulates chloride and water secretion by intestinal and tracheobronchial epithelium. Previous human studies have shown that normal skin, and intestinal and nasal mucosa have rich intrinsic neuronal networks for VIP secretion around exocrine glands. In contrast, CF tissues have little or no VIPergic innervation. These early findings suggest VIP plays a critical role in CF development. Our lab has since confirmed, in vitro and in vivo, the need for chronic VIP exposure to maintain functional CFTR chloride channels at the cell surface of airways and intestinal epithelium as well as normal exocrine tissues morphology.",

            "text": "Supported by Cystic Fibrosis Canada. Mucus plugging of the respiratory apparatus and impaired clearance of mucus from the airways are hallmarks of CF lung disease, leading to the proliferation of pathogenic organisms and concomitant tissue destruction. A range of novel therapeutics targeting mechanisms contributing to abnormal CF mucus are being advanced and are at various stages of preclinical and clinical testing. Here, we evaluated the effect of ARINA-1, a patented inhalational combination product composed of three natural compounds currently in use with favorable safety profiles (ascorbic acid, bicarbonate, glutathione), on key microanatomic features of the mucociliary clearance apparatus as assessed via 1-micron resolution optical coherence tomography. In terminally differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) monolayers derived from 4 F508del-homozygous CF donors, ARINA-1 (250 mM, apical) elicited significantly higher absolute (2.8\u00b10.4mm/ min, P<0.0001) and relative (change vs. baseline: \u03942.7\u00b10.4mm/min, P<0.0001) mucociliary transport (MCT) rates vs PBS (0.2\u00b10.1mm/min and \u03940.2\u00b10.1mm/min), peaking at 6 hours. ARINA-1 had no discernable effect on either absolute (not reported) or relative change in airway surface liquid (ASL: \u03942.9\u00b11.2\u00b5m) or ciliary beat frequency (CBF: \u03941.2\u00b10.5Hz) relative to PBS (\u03944.8\u00b13.9\u00b5m, NS or \u03941.1\u00b10.2Hz, NS). Linear regression analyses established that changes in ASL and CBF with ARINA-1 were significantly associated with changes in MCT, as seen in normal HBE, whereas relationships were weaker for PBS, as in CF (\u0394ASL: ARINA-1, R 2 =0.40, b=0.22, P<0.001 and PBS, R 2 =0.14, b=0.03, P<0.05; \u0394CBF: ARINA-1, R 2 =0.22, b=0.52, P=0.01 and PBS, R 2 =0.10, b=0.10, P=0.08). This distinction is likely related to differences in viscosity and/or adhesion. Consistent with this, we previously reported that ARINA-1 decreases mucus reflectivity (an indicator of viscosity), and particle tracking microrheology analysis of mucus viscosity is in progress. Supplementary studies indicated that the effect of ARINA-1 on MCT was largely driven by the combination of bicarbonate with glutathione (ARINA-1 vs. PBS: \u03941.4\u00b10.3mm/min, P<0.0001; bicarbonate+glutathione vs. PBS: \u03941.3\u00b10.7mm/min, P<0.0001), and that ARINA-1 augmented the effect of lumacaftor (3\u00b5M, VX-809) and ivacaftor (10\u00b5M, VX-770) (LUMA/IVA) on MCT (ARINA-1+LUMA/IVA vs. PBS: \u03943.0\u00b10.7mm/min, P<0.0001; LUMA/IVA vs. PBS: \u03940.26\u00b10.1mm/min, NS). Assessment of CFTR Cltransport revealed an increase in Isc-dependent current in response to ARINA-1 in CFBE4o-cells expressing wild-type CFTR, largely driven by stimulation of CFTR activity by ascorbic acid, although this response was absent in CFBE41o-F508del cells, implicating CFTR-independent mechanisms for ARINA-1 effect on CF mucus. Overall, results indicate that ARINA-1 increases MCT rate in primary F508del HBE monolayers, suggesting its potential as a novel approach to improving mucus clearance in CF patients.

Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA Introduction: Lung disease in CF is characterized by early airway obstruction, lung remodeling, and inflammation. Studies demonstrate that airway smooth muscle (ASM) dysfunction may be a primary defect contributing to airway hyperreactivity and obstruction in young CF patients. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in lung remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. TGF\u03b2 also drives increased ASM tone and proliferation, potentially through release of cytokines such as IL-6. TGF\u03b2 is a genetic modifier and biomarker of CF lung disease severity, yet its pulmonary levels in very young CF patients and its mechanism of disease modification in CF are unknown. We hypothesize that CFTR deficiency impacts the pulmonary response to TGF\u03b2, contributing to airway obstruction and ASM dysfunction.",

While VX-770 in nasal epithelia from patients on ivacaftor therapy was lower than HBE, drug persisted in nasospheres assessed within a few days of collection. These findings suggest that dosing strategies based on serum pharmacokinetics may not accurately predict CFTR modulator effects in target tissues. Furthermore, the persistence of VX-770 has significant implications for treatment and precision medicine studies of patients on this therapy. There is growing evidence to suggest that NE independently contributes to impaired macrophage phagocytic function.

These perturbations reflect a combination of degraded cell surface proteins implicated in phagocytosis and phagocytic target recognition. We also found unexpected plasma membrane targets that may be required for phagocytic function such as those that orchestrate the necessary cytoskeletal rearrangements. Future directions include evaluating shed/secreted proteins by an analysis of NE effects on biotinylated plasma membrane proteins as well as confirmation of the role of targets by performing siRNA or pharmacologic inhibition of receptors. Nonresolving inflammation and infections are key underlying mechanisms of progressive loss of respiratory function in patients suffering with cystic fibrosis (CF). Resolution of inflammation is an active process in which endogenous chemical mediators, such as resolvin (Rv) D1, promote the termination of the inflammatory response by acting on ALX/FPR2 and GPR32 receptors. Here, we investigated bioactions of RvD1 in chronic lung inflammation and infection by a clinical strain of P. aeruginosa (PA-RP73) in preclinical model of CF. Then, we assessed resolution of inflammation in mice overexpressing hALX/FPR2 (Fpr2/KI) upon PA-RP73 infection. To this end, RP73 agar beads were injected into lungs of C57Bl6/N and Fpr2/KI mice. RvD1 (100 ng/mouse) or vehicle were administered via intragastric gavage. Disease severity, inflammation resolution, and bacterial load were evaluated at 21 days post-infection (DPI) through the analysis of: 1. clinical signs; 2. total and differential bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) leukocyte counts; 3. lung morphology; 4. PA CFU counting. Total RNA and miRNA were isolated from sorted lung macrophages and used to perform real time PCR. Inoculum of PA-agar beads produced a nonresolving pulmonary inflammation in mice that recapitulates histological and biochemical features of human pathology. Administration of RvD1 significantly reduced airway PA titer (2.99\u00b12.76x10 5 CFU (RvD1) vs. 2.03\u00b10.13x10 6 CFU (vehicle)), neutrophil infiltration (T 50 = from 12 to 10 DPI) and tissue pathology. RvD1 treatment significantly enhanced killing of PA and apoptotic neutrophils by murine lung macrophages (P<0.05). In murine macrophages RvD1 regulated expression of microRNAs miR-21 (P<0.001) and 155 (P=0.029) and downstream genes (toll-like receptors, NF-\u03baB) resulting in reduced inflammatory signaling. Moreover, we observed a greater ability to resolve PA pulmonary inflammation in Fpr2-KI mice compared with wild-type, highlighting the protective role of the receptor in lung inflammation. Indeed, PA infected Fpr2-KI mice showed an enhanced bacterial clearance by 30% and macrophages (P=0.03) in BAL. Collectively, these results unveil beneficial effects and mechanisms of action of RvD1, providing evidence for its anti-inflammatory and proresolution actions in chronic lung inflammation and infection. This is consistent with the observed protective function of RvD1 receptor, confirming its relevant involvement in the resolution process. These findings also point to RvD1 as a prototype of innovative therapeutic strategy for CF based on the exploitation of endogenous resolution mediators. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease characterized by progressive pulmonary inflammation and infection that leads to declining lung function and ultimately death. Previous studies have shown elevated markers of inflammation, such as cytokine IL-8, in the lungs of individuals with CF that was out of proportion to the concurrent level of infection. It is known that the tissues of CF subjects are characterized by elevated inflammatory markers, but there is debate as to whether this is secondary to a pro-inflammatory infectious environment or due to an inherent feature of cells lacking the CFTR protein. The objective of this study was to use an isogenic cell line to determine the contribution of CFTR to an inflammatory reaction.",

These lines all maintained CFTR mRNA production and formation of tight junctions, and those with intact CFTR displayed short circuit currents in response to forskolin, while the CFTR-null lines did not.

Following separate stimulations with TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2, all cells responded with increased CXCL8 and IL6 mRNA expression as measured by RT-PCR. Both stimuli caused higher and more varied expression of CXCL8 mRNA in the CFTR-null cells compared to CFTR-intact cells. TNF\u03b1 at 100ng/mL increased CXCL8 70.88 \u00b1 37.99 fold in wild-type (WT) lines, but 194.31 \u00b1 117.94 fold in CFTR-null cells. IL1\u03b2 at 0.1ng/mL increased CXCL8 915.81 \u00b1 609.8 fold in WT lines, but 1258.74 \u00b1 1007.08 fold in CFTR-null cells. There was not a significant difference in IL6 production between CFTR intact and null cell lines using either stimulus. Transcriptomes (RNA-seq) from a subset of these lines at baseline and then after TNF\u03b1 stimulation showed 402 and 264 genes differentially expressed according to CFTR genotype. Gene set (pathway) comparisons were carried out and only one pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, was different in the baseline state, but 9 sets emerged upon stimulation. These data suggest that the absence or loss of CFTR leads to epigenetic differences between CF and non-CF cells, but also that gene and environment interactions are involved in eliciting CF phenotypic differences.

Center, Univ of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 2. Physics and Astronomy, Univ of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA CF lung disease arises from a muco-inflammatory state in distal airways that initiates a cycle of infection and airway obstruction. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is the only current method of studying the biophysics and biochemistry of the distal airway surface liquid (ASL) in early disease. Of particular interest are muco-inflammatory markers including mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC and DNA which are often recovered in the form of unswellable mucus \"flakes\" that can be found in both health and CF. While the lavage inherently dilutes the ASL milieu, we show that 53% of the mucus-forming mucins in CF are present as insoluble \"flakes\" or \"rafts\" that are observable via microscopy. Because a majority of mucins are insoluble, we hypothesize that studying these flakes will yield insight regarding the etiology of CF lung disease. Flakes in BALF present a number of research obstacles mostly arising from the difficulties of extracting the biophysical signals attributable to flakes from the background of lavage fluid. Here, we present a novel methodology that combines particle tracking microrheology (PTMR) and Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to isolate and study the biophysics and clinical implications of these flakes.",

Blocking the nervous system with intramuscular atropine, to block the parasympathetic stimulation of airway gland secretion, and topical lidocaine, to block sensory fibers, reduced the effect of hypertonic saline treatment by ~50% in vivo. Incubating isolated trachea ex vivo preparations from wild-type swine with known inhibitors of ion transport across airway epithelia (i.e., CFTRinh172, bumetanide and niflumic acid in bicarbonate-free saline) also resulted in a 50% reduction in the effect of hypertonic saline treatment. Furthermore, cystic fibrosis swine (CFTR -\\-) trachea ex vivo preparations also showed substantially decreased secretory response to hypertonic saline treatment after blockage of neuronal activity with atropine and lidocaine. Our findings indicate that hypertonic saline nebulization treatment-triggered airway surface liquid secretion is mediated in part by the stimulation of airway neurons and the subsequent activation of active epithelia secretion; only ~50% of the secretion is the result of osmotically driven fluid production.",

The next day, readings were performed every 5 minutes in a temperature and CO 2 equilibrated plate-reader. Agonists and inhibitors were added either with the dyes if their target was located apically or after 2 hours of baseline readings if their target was on the basolateral membrane. The effects of agonists and inhibitors were also measured on short-circuit current (Isc) in Ussing chambers either in the absence of Cl -, or under a basolateral to apical HCO 3 gradient. Results: A rise in [cAMP]i (using 10 \u00b5M forskolin) alkalinised the ASL of non-CF HAECs (t 1/2 = 35 min) which was blocked by the PKA inhibitor H89 and the CFTR inhibitor CFTRInh172. Surprisingly, resting ASL pH was not different between CF and non-CF HAECs and CFTRInh172, in the absence of forskolin, did not affect resting ASL pH of non-CF HAECs. This result was correlated to an absence of response in resting Isc to CFTRInh172 in Cl --free or HCO 3 gradient conditions. In non-CF HAECs, carbonic anhydrase and apical Na + -H + -Exchanger were not involved in resting nor forskolin-induced ASL pH regulation but inhibiting the Na + -Bicarbonate Cotransporter (NBC), using 30 \u00b5M S0859, reduced resting and forskolin-induced increases in ASL pH. Interestingly, the inhibition of the basolateral Anion Exchanger 2 (AE2) significantly increased intracellular pH as well as ASL pH.

Introduction: The cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is a transmembrane protein, involved in the transport of bicarbonate and chloride ions. In cystic fibrosis (CF) the CFTR is mutated, leading to an absence or reduction in the CFTR function, resulting in abnormal airway surface liquid, recurrent pulmonary infections, and inflammation. The CFTR is assembled and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded protein leads to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The most common mutation in CF, \u0394F508, results in misfolding of the CFTR and accumulation within the ER. The UPR comprises three signaling pathways involving three ER transmembrane proteins, known respectively as PERK, IRE1\u03b1, and ATF6. UPR activation, through its IRE1\u03b1 arm, has been linked to production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF. The aim of this study was to investigate the level and extent of abnormal UPR activation, mainly IRE1\u03b1, and proinflammatory cytokine production in patients with CF and also in cell lines harbouring different classes of CFTR mutations.",

The overproduction of IL-6, in HBECs, is IRE1\u03b1 dependent, as IL-6 production was reduced when the IRE1 inhibitor was used. We have shown that the UPR is implicated in driving IL-6 overproduction in CF innate immune cells, and this overproduction may contribute to the abnormal inflammatory phenotype seen in patients with CF. 2 1. Cell Biology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, NL, Netherlands; 2. Sophia Children's Hospital, Ped. Pulmonol., Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 3. Center for CF and Airway Disease, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA Introduction: Current evidence shows that CF lung disease is initiated in CF infants before the onset of bacterial colonization, suggesting an innate, CFTR-dependent, mechanism as the trigger for early inflammation and tissue remodeling. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that the EGFR/ ADAM17 axis, which controls the shedding of growth factors and cytokines involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling, is more active in primary differentiated CF vs. non-CF airway epithelial cultures (HBEC-ALI) (Stolarczyk M, et al. Am J Physiol. 2018; 314:L555-68) . Since ADAM17 is activated by oxidation of its extracellular proteolytic domain, and substantially reduced by supplementing the medium with glutathione (GSH), this is consistent with a more oxidized extracellular milieu in CF airway epithelia, likely due to deficient GSH transport. We hypothesize that CFTR-related oxidative stress contributes to the progression of early CF lung disease by activating epithelial pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling.",

            "text": "The use of molecular biology approaches has re-emerged as potential therapeutic modalities for cystic fibrosis. Primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells grown on permeable supports are often used to evaluate the efficacy of these various molecular approaches including the delivery of: nanoparticles, mRNA, DNA, tRNA, viral vectors and small oligonucleotides. In most experiments these molecular reagents are delivered to the apical surface of the hBE cultures in some volume of different compositions and a functional assay of anion secretion performed some time thereafter. The studies reported here were designed to evaluate the volume and time dependence of additions to the apical surface on the secretion of chloride in homozygous F508del-CFTR cells. Equivalent current (Ieq) measurements were made using a MTECC-24 on cells grown for 35 days at an air-liquid interface. Cells were washed four days before the experiments were initiated. PBS (phosphate buffered saline) was added to the apical surface in volumes ranging from 25 to 125 mL. Cells were treated with correctors: C17, C18, C17 plus C18 or DMSO for one to four days. Ieq measurements were made one to four days after the apical volume additions with and without the correctors. The results document volume and time dependent effects on the chloride secretion responses to forskolin and VX-770 stimulation. When measured the next day after the addition of 25 mL of PBS, chloride secretion was stimulated compared to untreated (no volume) controls. However, by day two this stimulatory effect was no longer evident. At 50 mL PBS and above chloride secretion was inhibited on day one and did not return to the level of untreated (no volume) controls for two to three days depending on the volume added. Notably with 75 mL and higher the chloride secretory response was substantially elevated in the corrector treated cells suggesting PBS was acting to up-regulate the effects of the correctors. Indeed, PBS is at least as efficacious as any of the \"second mechanism\" correctors we have evaluated in the Bridges lab. Future studies will be directed at understanding the mechanism of action of apical PBS on elevating the chloride secretory response. We speculate this mechanism could be used to advantage in the treatment of CF. The results also document the importance of performing appropriate controls when attempting to evaluate molecular reagents delivered to the apical surface. Performed too early after an addition a positive effect of a given reagent could be inhibited by the added volume, performed with a larger volume will require longer duration exposures and small effects could be overshadowed by the volume effect.

We sought to investigate how monocyte responses may be impaired in people with CF. In prior work, we used proteomics to study blood monocytes from a cohort of 12 people with CF and G551D CFTR mutations before and 7 days after starting the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor. This study design, which compared cells from the same individuals before and after restoration of CFTR function, identified highly statistically significant changes in the abundance of 21 monocyte proteins despite a small cohort size. The data from this study suggested that monocytes isolated from subjects pre-ivacaftor have heightened responses to the inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 compared to cells recovered after initiation of ivacaftor.",

Background: Currently, the mechanisms that underlie the maladaptive formation of bronchiectasis seen in patients with cystic fibrosis are unknown. Prior studies suggest that epithelial repair is dysregulated in individuals with cystic fibrosis, and that aberrant epithelial repair plays a role in the development of bronchiectasis. It has been demonstrated that airway basal cells (BC) have the potential to generate both ciliated and secretory epithelial cells, serving as a proximal airway progenitor cell. Therapies aimed at regulating basal cell proliferation and directing their differentiation toward specific lineages may reverse the disease process and halt the detrimental effects of end-stage lung disease. We hypothesized that airway BC are primed to regenerate injured airway epithelial cells; specifically, epithelial injury triggers changes in the transcriptome within basal cells which allows the regeneration of lung epithelium.",

Ibuprofen is the standard of care for anti-inflammatory therapies. Recent work has even demonstrated that ibuprofen use improves long-term survival. However, relatively few patients use ibuprofen therapy due to potential adverse effects. Finding other interventions within the CF inflammatory cascade could provide the same therapeutic benefit of ibuprofen without the adverse events that limit use. We have previously identified microtubule alterations in CF cells including reduced acetylation and slower rates of reformation. These changes impair intracellular transport of endosomes leading to pro-inflammatory signaling. Inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a cytosolic deacetylase that regulates tubulin acetylation, restores intracellular transport and dampens inflammatory signaling. We also identified that ibuprofen treatment normalizes CF microtubule regulation resulting in more stable microtubules, improved intracellular transport, and related anti-inflammatory signaling. The similar effects of ibuprofen treatment and HDAC6 inhibition at the cellular level lead to the hypothesis that HDAC6 inhibition is an alternative to ibuprofen as an anti-inflammatory therapy.",

Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy; 3. Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genova, is a calcium-activated chloride channel with a particular expression in non-ciliated airway epithelial cells. Activation of TMEM16A by calcium agonists results in enhanced chloride and bicarbonate secretion. The physiological role of TMEM16A, which is upregulated under conditions that favor mucus hypersecretion, and its involvement in cystic fibrosis (CF) are still unclear. Our aim is to identify novel pharmacological modulators of TMEM16A function. We are using a high-throughput functional assay to screen a maximally-diverse chemical library (11,300 compounds). For the screening, FRT cells with expression of TMEM16A(abc) isoform and the halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (HS-YFP) are stimulated with a low concentration of UTP to induce partial activation of TMEM16A. TMEM16A potentiators and inhibitors are detected as compounds that accelerate or slow down the rate of HS-YFP quenching, respectively. Controls during the screening included the Ani9 inhibitor (Seo Y, et al. PLoS One. 2016; 11:e0155771) and a TMEM16A potentiator that we identified in a previous study. After screening nearly half of the library, we have selected a set of compounds that enhance or inhibit TMEM16A function. We are giving priority to compounds with stimulatory activity. These hits are evaluated in secondary assays based on: i) null FRT cells, to rule out compounds acting on other channels/ transporters; ii) CFPAC-1 cells (which have endogenous TMEM16A expression), to confirm activity in a second cell type; iii) stimulation of TMEM16A with ionomycin, to bypass purinergic receptors; iv) evaluation of intracellular calcium mobilization with a fluorescent probe, to detect compounds with an indirect mechanism of action. After completion of the library screening, compounds with the best characteristics will be tested in CF human bronchial epithelial cells (short-circuit current experiments) to assess the effect on calcium-dependent chloride secretion. Novel pharmacological modulators of TMEM16A (potentiators and inhibitors) could be useful as tools of research and as possible therapeutic agents to improve mucociliary function in CF and other respiratory diseases. This work is supported by CFF (grant GALIET17G0). The second messenger cAMP exerts a negative constraint on the activation of the innate immune response by limiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1. Activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induces the expression of the cAMP-phosphodiesterase variant PDE4B2, which hydrolyzes and inactivates cAMP, thus allowing for full activation of the inflammatory response. Counteracting the LPS-induced expression of PDE4B2 by inhibiting its enzymatic activity is a critical mechanism by which inhibitors of type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) exert anti-inflammatory effects. Probing the potential of PDE4 inhibition for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, we found that treatment with the archetypal PDE4 inhibitor rolipram reduces LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 production in primary human airway epithelial cells from both non-CF and F508del-CFTR donors by similar levels, suggesting that PDE4 inhibition retains its anti-inflammatory efficacy on a background of altered immune responses in CF. We also observed the established LPS-induced surge in PDE4B2 expression. However, PDE4B2 levels were not only induced by LPS, but also by treatment with PDE4 inhibitor per se; and PDE4 inhibition further amplified the LPS-mediated PDE4B2 induction. This induction is unique to PDE4B2, as other PDE4B splicing variants or PDE4 subtypes PDE4A, PDE4C and PDE4D were not altered by LPS and/ or PDE4 inhibitor treatment. PDE4B2 induction is not unique to rolipram treatment, but was observed upon treatment with a number of structurally distinct compounds, suggesting it is a class effect of nonselective PDE4 inhibitors. Pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 ablates PDE4 inhibitor-induced PDE4B2 expression, suggesting that it results from excessive cAMP/PKA signaling. Indeed, PDE4B2 expression is also induced by treatment with saturating concentrations of the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. PDE4B2 protein levels remain elevated for several hours upon washout of PDE4 inhibitor. Thus, PDE4B2 induction may limit the efficacy of PDE4 inhibitors to elevate cAMP and reduce inflammation at clinically relevant, submaximal concentrations. Inactivation of individual PDE4 subtypes using isoform-selective inhibitors did not induce PDE4B2 expression, likely because they trigger smaller, locally restricted increases in cAMP/PKA compared to the nonselective inhibition of total cellular PDE4. Development of subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitors is currently pursued as a way to separate the side effects from the therapeutic benefits of the nonselective PDE4 inhibitors available to date. Our present results indicate that subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitors might have the added benefit of not inducing the pro-inflammatory variant PDE4B2. This work was supported by grants from the CFF and the NIH (HL76125, HL141473, HL066299, DK072517). Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic inflammatory condition associated with high circulating plasma levels of the chemokines interleukin (IL)-8 and neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2). Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an acute phase glycoprotein that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties by binding IL-8 and NAP-2. Glycosylation is the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides, with different combinations giving rise to different glycoforms. During the inflammatory response to pneumonia, increased levels of IL-6 results in increased sialic acid residues on AAT (sAAT), following upregulation of the enzyme \u03b1-2, 6-sialyltransferase (ST6GAL1). sAAT aids resolution by binding IL-8 and NAP-2. Individuals with CF have high circulating levels of IL-6, which could lead to persistently altered glycosylation of AAT. Therefore, our aim was to determine the specific glycoprofile of AAT in CF and the consequence of altered glycosylation.",

Airway remodeling is a key component of CF that leads to increased morbidity and mortality of patients with CF. Understanding changes in extracellular matrix organization and immune system function of CF vs. non-CF cells at baseline may provide insight into what leads to airway remodeling in CF patients. While these findings need to be validated in CF and non-CF primary HBE cells, this data may provide insight into the ability of CF patients to handle infections from a molecular standpoint. Introduction: Chronic infection and inflammation of the respiratory tract, causing severe and irreversible lung tissue damage are a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF). Neutrophils are crucial in combating infection and alterations in their function could contribute to abnormal immune responses on multiple levels. There is growing evidence that the CF neutrophil is intrinsically abnormal, however, molecular mechanisms underlying increased primary granule degranulation remain unclear. One protein released from primary granules is the bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI), which has potent bactericidal effects exclusive to gram-negative bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the cause of increased primary granule and BPI release and to understand why BPI, present in high quantities in the CF lung, is unable to effectively eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection.",

The incidence of AABs directed against BPI is increased in PWCF and these were found to be complexed with BPI in BALF, leading to impaired bacterial killing and persistence of PA in the CF lung. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Using a CF pig model, we identified at least two primary host defense defects in newborn CF large airways: impaired mucociliary transport and impaired antimicrobial capacity due to a lower airway surface liquid (ASL) pH in CF compared to non-CF. The ASL pH of the large airway is set by the balance of CFTR-mediated HCO 3 transport and ATP12A-mediated proton secretion. However, in distal small airways (diameter <200 \u00b5m), which also had an acidic ASL in CF compared to non-CF cell cultures, we found that ATP12A expression and activity is diminished. Therefore, we hypothesize that small airways must use a different mechanism to regulate acid secretion. Microarray data from small airway epithelia revealed that ATP6V0D2, a subunit of the H + -translocating plasma membrane V-type ATPase, could mediate proton secretion in small airways. ATP6V0D2 is expressed on the apical surface of Muc5B + secretory cells, but not in ciliated cells in small airways. Bafilomycin, a V-type ATPase inhibitor, increased ASL pH in small airway epithelia in the presence or absence of HCO 3 -. In addition, bafilomycin decreased ASL viscosity measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay.",

We found, in striking contrast to wild-type CFTR, Q1291F CFTR did not improve survival. Necropsies showed intestinal obstruction in CFTR -/and CFTR -/-; TgQ1291F mice at the time of death but not in CFTR -/-; TgWT and CFTR +/+ mice sacrificed at a similar survival time. Expression of wild-type CFTR but not of Q1291F CFTR restored transepithelial Cl \u2212 secretion mediated by CFTR in the small intestine of weanling mice and reduced the presence of mucus. Our results indicate that CFTR adenylate kinase activity is essential for CFTR function in vivo. Acknowledgment: Supported by NIH/NIDDK. Genetic modifiers have considerable influence on lung function variation in cystic fibrosis (CF). Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 is a known modifier associated with accelerated lung disease in patients homozygous for F508del. Increased TGF-\u03b21 levels are associated with variants of the TGF-\u03b21 gene, present in ~40% of F508del homozygous patients. The relevance of TGF-\u03b21 has been demonstrated by the inhibitory effect on CFTR mRNA and subsequent resistance of F508del-CFTR to corrector-mediated rescue in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Understanding the regulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in human airways is critical to design strategies to attenuate abnormal TGF-\u03b2 signaling, allowing the rescue of F508del-CFTR. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of TGF-\u03b21 signaling via the proximal pathway at the level of TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2R)-I and T\u03b2R-II in HBE cells. TGF-\u03b21 initiates a signaling cascade by binding to T\u03b2R-II, which phosphorylates and activates T\u03b2R-I; in turn, this receptor activates receptor (R)-Smads, initiating an intracellular signaling. In nonstimulated cells, protein phosphatase (PP)1 dephosphorylates T\u03b2R-I, protecting it from constitutive activation by T\u03b2R-II; however, it remains unknown how TGF-\u03b21 blocks the PP1-mediated inhibition of T\u03b2R-I to initiate its signaling. We hypothesized that, after TGF-\u03b21 stimulus, PP1 is inhibited through phosphorylation on its residue T320, thereby allowing the activation of T\u03b2R-I. Lemur tyrosine kinase-2 (LMTK2), which is also known to phosphorylate CFTR, organizes a protein network that mediates the inhibitory phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c) in HeLa cells. PP1 interacts with several proteins that regulate its localization and catalytic activity; however, it is unknown whether LMTK2 also inactivates PP1 in human bronchial epithelial cells.",

Indeed, siRNA mediated LMTK2 depletion promoted activation of PP1c, leading to a subsequent attenuation of the TGF-\u03b21 signaling via R-Smads. In turn, abundance of the R-Smads protein was increased to counteract these effects. These results were confirmed by a selective PP1c activator, which also inhibited activation of R-Smads despite TGF-\u03b21 treatment. To better understand how PP1c is regulated after TGF-\u03b21 stimulus, we examined mRNA expression of the PP1c-and LMTK2-interacting proteins by mRNA-seq. Changes in the expression level of 27 genes were observed, including GADD34 and p35. Proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry showed an interaction between PP1c and Inhibitor 2, a protein previously described as a mediator of LMTK2 inhibition of PP1c.",

Our studies may lead to novel therapeutic targets blocking abnormal TGF-\u03b21 signaling, thereby improving the functional rescue of F508del-CFTR by CFTR correctors. Airway submucosal gland serous acini are major sites of CFTR expression in the airways. Submucosal glands secrete a large amount of the fluid and mucus forming the airway surface liquid. Serous acinar cells likely generate most of the fluid secreted by these glands. Agonists that signal through cAMP, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), activate CFTR-dependent secretion from intact glands and isolated acinar cells. We studied primary serous acinar cells isolated from submucosal glands dissected from residual human nasal turbinate tissue obtained after sinus surgery. We previously characterized VIP/cAMP-activated, CFTR-dependent Cl --driven fluid secretion from serous cells using DIC imaging of cell volume to track agonist-induced changes in cell solute content reflective of changes in the secretory state of the cells (Lee RJ, Foskett JK. J Clin Invest. 2010; 120(9) :3137-48). This technique was combined with simultaneous quantitative fluorescence microscopy to measure the intracellular concentrations of ions involved in driving fluid secretion ([Cl -] i ) and regulating it ([Ca 2+ ] i ). In the present study, we combined imaging of cell volume and intracellular pH (pH i ) to identify if and how serous cells secrete bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) during VIP/cAMP-stimulated fluid secretion. HCO 3 secretion by serous cells is important for proper airway surface liquid pH as well as polymerization of mucins secreted by more proximal mucus cells in the glands. During VIP stimulation, pH i transiently dropped concomitantly with the fall in Clcontent revealed by cell shrinkage. This likely reflected HCO 3 efflux, as it was almost completely reduced (>90%) in the absence of CO 2 / HCO 3 -. A subsequent alkalinization increased pH i above resting levels; this was predominately inhibited by the Na + /HCO 3 cotransporter (NBC) inhibitor 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DNDS). Elimination of driving forces for conductive HCO 3 efflux by ion substation or exposure of serous cells to CFTR inh 172 reduced VIP-induced acidification by >80%. VIP-induced pH i acidification was also markedly reduced (>75%) in serous cells from CF patients. The non-CFTR Clchannel inhibitors niflumic acid and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) had no effect on VIP-induced acidification. Our data suggest that the majority of HCO 3 efflux during cAMP-evoked serous acinar cell secretion is conductive efflux via CFTR. HCO 3 secretion during VIP stimulation is sustained by NBC activity, whereas we previously showed that cholinergic/Ca 2+ -induced HCO 3 secretion is largely sustained by Na + /H + exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1)-mediated alkalinization. In contrast to some studies of surface epithelial cells and Calu-3 cells, our data do not support a substantial role for apical Cl -/HCO 3 exchange in HCO 3 secretion from primary serous acinar cells.

Assessment of the effect of treatment with immunoglobulins will assist in the decision to treat patients with CF. Final analysis of the data will be presented at the conference. SLC26A9 is a member of the SLC26 gene family of anion channels and transporters that have diverse functional roles in epithelia. We previously identified, by high-throughput screening, small molecule inhibitors of SLC26A4 (pendrin) and SLC26A3 (DRA) and demonstrated their potential utility to treat CF lung and gastrointestinal disorders, respectively. The SLC26A9 chloride transporter, which is expressed mainly in airway and gastric epithelia, has been proposed as a mutation-agnostic, prosecretory target for CF drug development. In CF subjects, SLC26A9 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to meconium ileus, prenatal exocrine pancreatic damage, and CF-related diabetes. Of direct relevance to CF lung disease, treatment responses to ivacaftor in CF subjects with the G551D mutation are associated with a single SLC26A9 polymorphism, and SLC26A9 loss-of-function mutations are found in subjects with diffuse bronchiectasis with or without CF; however, SLC26A9 polymorphisms are not directly associated with CF lung disease severity. These results have been interpreted to suggest that SLC26A9 compensates for CFTR loss-of-function in certain organs, and hence activation of SLC26A9 may provide a mutation-agnostic therapeutic approach for CF. To clarify the role of SLC26A9 in the lung epithelium, we identified small molecule SLC26A9 inhibitors by high-throughput screening and are applying them to study airway and gastrointestinal epithelial physiology. For screening, cDNA encoding human SLC26A9 was cloned into pLION for generation of FRT cells stably expressing SLC26A9 and a halide-sensitive YFP (EYFP-H148Q/I152L/F46L). SLC26A9-mediated transport was assayed from the kinetics of YFP fluorescence quenching in response to extracellular addition of iodide to drive chloride/iodide exchange, in which transport inhibition reduces the rate of fluorescence decrease. 50,000 chemically diverse, synthetic small molecules were screened at 25 mM, utilizing 0.35 mM niflumic acid (a non-selective inhibitor) as positive control. The SLC26A9 screen was robust, with Z'-factor >0.65, and the overall rate for identification of inhibitors was 0.04%, with several distinct chemical classes of inhibitors identified. Inhibitors with different SLC26A9 selectivity were identified, including highly selective compounds that did not inhibit pendrin or DRA. Further optimization of SLC26A9 inhibitors for Objective: Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) is a new CFTR modulator combination that improves forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients aged \u226512 years with CF who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR (F/F; EVOLVE, NCT02347657) and in those heterozygous for F508del-CFTR and a second allele with a CFTR mutation predicted to have residual function (F/RF; EXPAND, NCT02392234). Long-term safety and efficacy are being assessed in EXTEND, an ongoing open-label extension study (NCT02565914). Benefits in lung function are considered to result from 2 physiological effects: (1) a reduction in airway resistance (Raw) due to decreased narrowing and (2) an improvement in breathing capacity (BC) due to opening of collapsed airways. To characterize how TEZ/IVA impacts respiratory function in both F/F and F/RF populations, improvement in FEV 1 mediated by these distinct mechanisms was assessed.",

MUC5AC and MUC5B are the major secreted mucins in the airways of CF patients. Because no therapies are available to treat CF airway mucus overproduction, there is an unmet medical need for new therapies that target mucin synthesis in CF airways.

CF-affected macrophages (M\u03a6s) are hyperinflammatory, fail to reinstate tissue homeostasis and therefore contribute to disease progression. We previously found that CF M\u03a6s fail to downregulate microRNA-199a-5p (miR-199a-5p) expression after LPS stimulation. This leads to decreased amounts of caveolin 1 (CAV1), which normally terminates pro-inflammatory TLR-4 signaling. A dysregulation of the miR-199a-5p/CAV1 axis has also been described in lung tissues of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and in animal models of the disease. Dysfunctional miR-199a-5p/CAV1 axis increases TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which drives tissue remodeling. Using a chronic lung inflammation model, in which Cftr tm1Unc (CFKO) mice develop lung structural remodeling (Bruscia EM, et al. AJP Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2016; 310:L711-9) , we aim to investigate the role of miR-199a-5p and TGF-\u03b2 signaling on lung hyperinflammation and remodeling in CF. This is relevant to CF, since TGF-\u03b2 signaling is also highly increased in late-stage CF lung disease (Harris WT, et al. PLoS One. 2013; :e70196).",

Hyperglycemia in CFRD patients contributes to respiratory decline by promoting inflammation, increasing infection risk, and by likely adversely affecting ion channel function, though the mechanisms remain largely unknown. Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are proteins or lipids that become glycated and whose production is accelerated under conditions of hyperglycemia. AGEs bind to the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE or AGER) and activation of the membrane-bound form of RAGE (mRAGE) initiates a positive feedback loop that engages pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Increased levels of RAGE and RAGE ligands in CFRD patients negatively correlate with lung function, but there remains a significant gap in our understanding of how elevated RAGE expression leads to respiratory dysfunction in CFRD. In this study, we sought to understand the effects of hyperglycemia on apical K + (BK) channel current in normal human and cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (NHBE and CFBE) cells in vitro and evaluate the role of RAGE signaling in hyperglycemia-induced ion channel dysfunction in CF.",

Our data indicate that hyperglycemia causes a decrease in apical potassium secretion through BK channels that correlates with elevated levels of RAGE mRNA expression. However, RAGE is also likely to be important for the maintenance of junctional integrity, suggesting approaches to block RAGE signaling broadly could be detrimental in CFRD. As an alternative, soluble forms of RAGE (sRAGE), which function as decoy receptors and intercept pro-inflammatory ligands to prevent mRAGE activation, are being evaluated for their ability to reverse hyperglycemia-induced mucociliary dysfunction in CFBE cells. Airway protective behaviors, such as mucus secretion and airway smooth muscle contraction, require neural circuits. These behaviors are affected in airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis. Yet investigations that examine such behaviors often focus on a single component, thus neglecting the circuit response. In the current study, we compared the transcriptomes of an airway-nervous system circuit (e.g., tracheal epithelia, nodose ganglia, and brainstem) in response to acute airway acidification in neonatal piglets. Intratracheal acid, a potent stimulus of airway sensory nerves, induced sex-dependent airway hyperreactivity and sex-independent airway obstruction. Comparing the tracheal epithelia and nodose ganglia transcriptomes revealed concomitant decreases in transcripts important for neuronal inhibition, in male, but not female, acid-challenged piglets. Increased mRNA for pro-inflammatory markers was observed in the nodose ganglia and brainstem of male acid-challenged piglets, whereas females showed increased transcription of antiviral defense proteins. Comparing the brainstem and epithelia revealed a concurrent decrease in expression of mRNAs important for serotonergic transmission in male, but not in female, acid-challenged piglets. These findings highlight new sex-specific molecules that might be important for cystic fibrosis and other airway diseases. Supported by R00HL119560-03 and 10T2TR001983-01.",

Furthermore, adult females with CF experience worse lung-related outcomes than their male counterparts. However, the mechanism of sex-specific exacerbation of CF lung disease is not fully understood.

The approval of lumacaftor/ivacaftor (luma/iva) for CF subjects homozygous for the F508del mutation was based on findings that lumacaftor, a CFTR corrector, improved folding and trafficking of the CFTR protein to the cell membrane, in conjunction with ivacaftor, to augment lung function and nutritional status, and reduce the rate of pulmonary exacerbations by 39% (p<0.001). While reduction of pulmonary exacerbations, the outcome of greatest significance, is presumably linked to improvements in immune function and infection status, precise delineation of immune system effects is unknown. We hypothesized that transcriptome sequencing of whole blood leukocytes would sensitively capture differences in systemic immune responses in CF subjects before and after treatment with luma/iva. Methods: Circulating leukocyte RNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples in CF patients at baseline health prior to treatment and one month following treatment with luma/iva (n=17). Within the patient cohort were two groups: 1) 12 \"responders\" who stayed on the medication at one month with good tolerance and, 2) 5 \"nonresponders\" who either discontinued the medication or could only tolerate it at half dose. The isolated total RNA was processed for next-generation sequencing library construction. Pairwise statistical comparisons pre-and post-treatment were performed with the DESeq2 package of R statistical software. Each subject served as their own control. For the statistical comparisons, the cohort was split into responders and nonresponders; pre-and post-treatment samples were compared separately for each group. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed and modules correlated with demographic and clinical parameters.",

In the nonresponders, 20 genes were significantly upregulated and 2 genes downregulated. Co-expression network analysis of DEGs using WGCNA revealed several modules in the co-expression network were correlated with tolerance of full dose luma/iva.

Pediatrics, CWRU, Cleveland, OH, USA Splice variants can have a number of consequences on protein synthesis ranging from the production of no protein, truncated forms of protein or reduced quantities of wild-type (WT) protein. Differentiating among these possibilities is essential for the design and testing of therapeutic strategies for treating splice-site variants. Splice-site variants that permit expression of CFTR protein, whether aberrant or a reduced quantity of normal, may respond to corrector and/or potentiator therapy. To systematically investigate molecular consequences of 46 naturally occurring CF-causing variants (intronic=37 and missense=9), we incorporated 20/26 CFTR introns into 6 different expression mini-genes (EMGs). Missense variants were selected based on splicing predictions using CryptSplice and NNSplice or by their proximity to consensus splice sites. CFTR mRNA and protein were assessed by transient transfection of variant EMG in HEK293 cells and CFTR function was evaluated in CFBE stable cells. Cells expressing WT-EMG served as controls.",

Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA Introduction: Bitter taste receptors play an instrumental role in the innate immune response by increasing ciliary beat frequency (1, 2) and mucociliary clearance in airway epithelial cells (3) . Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor gene have recently been linked to chronic rhinosinusitis. The activity of the TAS2R38 protein depends on 3 common SNPs within the TAS2R38 gene, creating a \"functional\" (PAV) or \"nonfunctional\" (AVI) haplotype. Patients homozygous for the \"functional\" haplotype were found to have less severe sinus disease when compared to heterozygotes or patients homozygous for the \"nonfunctional\" haplotype (4) . Our objective was to determine whether the functional haplotype of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R38 is protective against sinus disease in patients with cystic fibrosis.",

We project 110 infants will be referred annually, and 650 infants will be reported as negative after comprehensive genetic analysis. Additional testing increases lab workload, turnaround times and cost, but is balanced by reduction in follow-up by NBS staff and care centers, and an overall reduction in healthcare costs due to elimination of most false positive screens. The identification of asymptomatic infants with two CFTR variants, especially variants of uncertain or varying clinical significance, with intermediate/negative sweat results poses new clinical and practical challenges for care teams and families. CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is one of the most important complications of CF, causing worse lung function, malnutrition, and mortality in CF. CFRD develops over time and occurs about 1.6-fold more frequently in females. We previously found variation in CFRD onset to be heritable, i.e., attributable to variants outside of CFTR and identified CFRD modifiers near SLC26A9 and at T2D susceptibility loci (TCF7L2, CDKAL1, CDKN2B-AS1, and IGF2BP2) using data from 3059 individuals. We now report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using an additional 2681 individuals provided by the International CF Gene Modifier Consortium (total n=5740). Variants at PTMA, SLC26A9 and TCF7L2 associated with CFRD onset with genome-wide significance. Association of variants near PTMA (eg, rs838455; p:3.9e-8, HR:1.75), which encodes for the secreted peptide thymosin alpha 1 (T\u03b11), is a novel finding. T\u03b11 is being investigated as a potential single-molecule-based therapy for CF (1, 2) . Variants at SLC26A9 (eg, rs4077468; p:2.75e-8, HR:0.72), which encodes for a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger that interacts with CFTR, were confirmed to associate with CFRD. Variants at the T2D locus TCF7L2 associated with CFRD (e.g. rs7903146; p:4.17e-12, HR:1.51), indicating some degree of shared pathophysiology. Other T2D-associated variants in CDKAL1, IGF2BP2 and CDKN2B-AS1 are also CFRD modifiers, however the CFRD modifier variants at CDKN2B-AS1 are most strongly associated with coronary artery disease, not T2D, in the general population.",

            "text": "The ability to detect lung disease in children via a noninvasive method would be highly beneficial for cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical care. Development of molecular biomarkers that are prognostic for CF lung disease could allow earlier and hence more effective intervention strategies. Ideally these would be molecules that are stable in body fluids and are mechanistically linked to pulmonary infection and/or inflammation. MicroRNAs are short nucleotide regulatory sequences that bind to target mRNAs to inhibit their expression. The CF lung is known to exhibit an altered miRNA expression profile, including miRNAs with targets such as CFTR, IL-8 and numerous other inflammatory mediators. A gender dichotomy exists in CF, whereby females are at a clinical disadvantage e.g. poorer lung function, earlier colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, greater frequency of exacerbations, and lower median survival age. The aim of this study was to compare the plasma miRNA expression profiles between male and female CF children in order to screen for candidate biomarkers of clinical outcomes that are gender correlated. miRNA expression was quantified in paediatric CF plasma from six males versus six females (Age range: 1-6 years; median age: 3 years; 9 Phe508del heterozygotes) using TaqMan OpenArray Human miRNA Panels. Principal component analysis indicated differences in male versus female miRNA profiles. Two miRNAs were significantly increased in the female samples (hsa-miR-885-5p, fold change: 5.07, adjusted p value: 0.026; and hsa-miR-193a-5p, fold change: 2.6, adjusted p value: 0.031), however only hsa-miR-885-5p was successfully validated by qRT-PCR (p< 0.0001). Gene ontology analysis of validated targets of miR-885-5p identified cell growth, adhesion and migration/motility (including neutrophil chemotaxis), as processes potentially affected, with Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1)-mediated signalling featuring significantly. To conclude, there is a significant increase in hsa-miR-885-5p in plasma of CF females versus males under six years of age; this miRNA may therefore have a role in the CF gender gap and may hold future potential as a biomarker. Introduction: Interpatient variability in drug response ranging from lack of efficacy to undesirable adverse drug events due to genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism, transport, and target receptors is well known. CFTR genotyping is well established but the effects of other gene variants in CF on drug response are less well described. The objective of the study was to determine the distribution of phenotypes and the frequency at which a change in medication prescribing is recommended based on presence of a genetic variant linked to drug response.",

Notably, the proportion of patients predicted to have altered drug metabolizer status for CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was: 18%, 33%, and 43% respectively. These three enzymes are important in the metabolism of opioids (CYP2D6), warfarin (CYP2C9), antidepressants (CYP2C19), and proton pump inhibitors (CYP2C19). In addition, 33% expressed low levels of SLC6A4 (serotonin receptor), which may lead to delayed response to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class of antidepressants; and 25% had gene variants of VKORC1 and CYP2C9, predicting increased sensitivity to warfarin. Based on the medications prescribed, 42% of patients were receiving therapy for which a change in therapy (agent or dose) is recommended.

Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA We utilize the yeast homolog of CFTR, YOR1, as a model protein for \"phenomic\" analysis, or the systematic evaluation of gene interactions. Phenomics reveals potential genetic modifiers and/or therapeutic targets to alleviate CF-causing variants. Quantitative high-throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP) is a technology we developed to measure gene interactions across the entire collection of yeast gene knockout and knockdown (YKO/KD) strains. Gene interactions are quantified by Q-HTCP-derived cell proliferation parameters that define phenotypic dependency between yor1 mutant alleles and yko/kd mutations, and thus define influence of gene networks potentially relevant to CFTR function. In this context, we perform systematic comparisons of wild-type, parent, single mutant and double mutant backgrounds, and incorporate analysis of yor1-\u03940 (control null allele), and yor1 encoding homologous mutations from CFTR variants of interest. We also show evolutionary conservation of gene interactions using mammalian airway models (primary human bronchial and nasal epithelia). The Q-HTCP workflow for phenomic analysis and genome-wide measurement of gene interaction has recently been refined and optimized further for studies of CF. In particular, we developed and applied an analytical workflow to integrate, compare and contrast gene interaction profiles relevant to CFTR obtained from different screens with the aim to more comprehensively identify functional relationships between all molecular targets that harbor the potential to rescue defective CFTR from numerous mechanistic subcategories. We applied recursive expectation maximization clustering (REMc), developed by our laboratory and used in conjunction with Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, to identify functional gene modules that include components of the proteosome, pathways for protein folding, and targets contributing to translational fidelity. Resulting phenomic data also provides \"toxicity\" information in that the primary effect of each modifier on cell fitness is assessed in conjunction with its influence on the function of the YOR1/CFTR model. This integrative analysis is intended to provide a systematic, quantitative, and comprehensive summary of genetic influences on CF disease expression resulting from differing alleles in a manner that can be directly correlated with genomewide association studies (GWAS) or emerging properties of complex CFTR alleles. As such, the approach represents a powerful and high-resolution model for developing personalized therapeutic strategies for individuals who possess compound heterozygous variants and/or mutation(s) unresponsive to currently available CFTR modulators. 1 1.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disease caused by mutations in the gene coding for the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Currently, more than 30,000 individuals in the US are living with CF and harbor over 1,700 reported mutations. Counterintuitively, despite being monogenic, the large number of distinct and rare variants of CFTR presents both a serious therapeutic selection challenge and confounds new drug discovery efforts. First-generation CFTR modulators targeting the defective protein are now FDA-approved for 34 genetic variants, which comprise ~59% of the patient population. New highly efficacious triple modulator therapy is currently in clinical development for all patients with at least one CFTR F508del allele. People bearing certain other CF variants will also benefit from the new therapy, but about 5% of all CF cases are not likely to improve from such treatment. These people typically carry two alleles that make no functional protein due to premature termination codon or severe splice mutations as well as some refractory missense mutations, e.g., N1303K.",

CFFT Lab, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Lexington, MA, USA; 2. UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA More than 1,700 genetic variants of the CFTR gene have been suggested to cause cystic fibrosis (CF). The ability to assess the effectiveness of both approved drugs and therapeutics in development against rare, diseasecausing CFTR variants is limited by the scarcity of primary tissues and cells for these genotypes. Immortalized cell lines heterologously overexpressing mutant CFTR are commonly used as an alternative. However, these artificial expression systems have fundamentally limited relevance, especially for premature termination codon (PTC) mutations. To address these issues and create specific CF mutations in genomic CFTR, we have developed a CRISPR/Cas9 based gene editing platform that enables the generation of new cell lines with essentially any CFTR variant in its genomic context. For its compatibility with CFTR functional assays, we selected the 16HBE14obronchial epithelial cell line (Dieter Gruenert, UCSF) and optimized a gene editing workflow. We have used this platform to create isogenic, homozygous cell lines for six CF-causing variants (F508del, G551D, N1303K, G542X, W1282X, and Y122X) , and more are currently in development. The resulting cell lines provide a virtually unlimited source of material with specific patient mutations that can be used in a variety of assays.",

Drug-induced readthrough is a promising therapeutic approach that can restore expression of full length CFTR and consequently repress nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Highthroughput screening campaigns using immortalized cell lines that heterologously overexpress CFTR PTC variants from cDNA are of reduced relevance because they are not subject to splicing-dependent NMD; so far these models have failed to identify agents for which readthrough activity and rescue of CFTR function translates to patient-derived human bronchial and nasal cells. The 16HBE14o-models of PTC variants are sensitive to NMD, overcoming the limitations of patient-derived primary cells and cDNA based heterologous cell lines. NMD causes reduced basal levels of CFTR mRNA in all three (G542X, W1282X, and Y122X) PTC cell lines. Treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of SMG1, one of the main effectors of the NMD pathway, can normalize mutant CFTR mRNA abundance. Interestingly, the sensitivity to SMG1 dependent NMD and the response to G418 mediated readthrough, as measured by mRNA abundance and CFTR function, varied between the different PTCs. W1282X is the most sensitive to NMD and less amenable to small molecule-mediated readthrough, while Y122X is more amenable to readthrough and only moderately sensitive to NMD. Together, these data suggest that treatment outcomes may vary depending on the specific PTC. These isogenic PTC cell lines will enable the discovery and development of effective NMD modulators and readthrough agents as well as inform therapeutic development strategies for specific PTC variants.",

In particular, PEX1 knockdown significantly increased W1282X-CFTR trafficking to the cell surface when combined with G418 (an established read-through agent), and induced a 5-fold improvement in chloride transport following combination treatment with G418 and the CFTR corrector, VX-661 (tezacaftor).

Similar, strong effects were noted for additional targets not otherwise expected to mediate translational readthrough. Ongoing experiments include evaluation of synergy between PEX1 and other molecular targets, quantitative levels of gene repression, and mechanistic studies (e.g. CFTR readthrough in the setting of specific peroxisome defects). Findings are also being evaluated in primary human CF airway epithelia. This work expands our knowledge regarding molecular pathobiology of nonsense mutations, and in the future, may offer a new therapeutic strategy for CF patients harboring PTC variants. Recently, there has been a rapid expansion of the number of new potential CFTR-directed therapies. These CFTR modulators can be broadly categorized into potentiators, correctors, amplifiers, stabilizers and nonsense suppressors. While in vitro studies may provide support for moving forward with specific modulators, the number of patients needed and the expense of clinical trials limit the ability to test these modulators individually and in combination for FDA approval. Cystic fibrosis animal models allow for in vivo testing of the practicality and efficacy of these CFTR modulators but animal and human CFTR sequence and gating differences are of concern. Without in vivo expression of human CFTR containing CF disease-causing mutations, a true clinical prediction of CFTR-directed therapies effects in patients may not be achieved. We created such a model by combining the many benefits of a mouse model with the ability to express human CFTR containing common CFTR mutations under the control of its adjacent endogenous regulatory elements. The human CFTR-expressing mouse (hCFTR) was created by the insertion of a ~260 kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the human CFTR gene and surrounding sequence. The BAC inserted into a single integration site on mouse chromosome 8. To verify that hCFTR expression could complement the loss of mouse CFTR (mCftr), the hCFTR expressing strain was crossed to a strain carrying a mCftr null mutation. hCFTR positive(+) CF mice displayed CFTR function, normal survival, intestinal histology, and growth while hCFTR(-) CF mice displayed reduced survival due to intestinal obstruction, abnormal intestinal histology and reduced growth. Utilizing the hCFTR expressing mouse strain, we successfully generated five human CFTR mutations (F508del, G542X, W1282X, G551D and 3849+10kb C>T) that allow various CFTR-directed therapies to be tested. We generated these specific CFTR mutations utilizing the genome editing system CRISPR/ Cas9. Optimal single guide RNAs, Cas9 nuclease and oligonucleotides carrying each CFTR mutation were injected into one-cell mouse embryos and implanted in pseudo-pregnant mice. DNA from the resulting pups of these five lines was sequenced using next generation sequencing with a MiSeq instrument. We obtained a high percentage of founder mice with each mutation (F508del(40%), G542X(50%), W1282X(33%), G551D(70%) and 3849+10kb C>T(13%)). Founders with each mutation were bred to mice carrying a mCftr null mutation to create CF mice carrying each hCFTR mutation. CF mice carrying mutant hCFTR have displayed lack of CFTR function and typical CF manifestations (e.g., poor growth and increased incidence of intestinal obstruction). Importantly, hCFTR F508del mice display correction of CFTR function using CFTR modulators (VX-809/VX-770 or VX-661/VX-770) in airway and intestinal cells. We are currently evaluating the ability of other CFTR modulators to restore CFTR function and alleviate CF manifestations in all 5 human mutation carrying strains. These models provide novel tools for in vivo evaluation of CFTR modulators as well as CFTR gene editing strategies for the treatment of CF. Introduction: Nonsense mutations affect 11% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) worldwide. Insertion of a premature termination codon (PTC) in the CFTR transcript subjects it to degradation by the surveillance mechanism nonsense mediated decay (NMD). Mouse models of CF are useful to evaluate protein expression and function, but are limited by failure to recapitulate the phenotypic manifestations of human disease. In this study, we generated a novel knock-in G542X rat model using CRIS-PR-Cas9 technology (Horizon Discovery) and characterized its phenotype, NMD sensitivity, and initial treatment response with amikacin, an aminoglycoside shown to induce translational readthrough in vitro and in CF G542X transgenic mice.",

Ileal I sc measurements showed minimal forskolin stimulation in G542X rats (29.8\u00b14.0 \u00b5A/cm 2 ) compared to WT (188.0\u00b111.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 , P< 0.0001).

CFTR mRNA levels of excised lung were ~5 fold less abundant in G542X rats compared to WT (P<0.005), suggesting sensitivity to NMD, as also observed in CF patients with PTCs. As has been shown previously (J Clin Invest. 2007; 117:683-92) , NMD efficiency is variable among CF patients and has been regulated by a negative feedback mechanism (Mol Cell. 2011; 43:950-61) . We have measured 4 conserved NMD factors (UPF1, UPF3b, SMG1 and SMG6) and 2 NMD substrates (RPL3 and SC35). Transcript levels of each were diminished in G542X rats compared to WT (~ 3 fold, P<0.05 for each), suggesting NMD might be globally upregulated in G542X rats in response to the nonsense mutation.

            "text": "Conclusions: We generated a novel rat model expressing the CFTR G542X mutation that is plagued by NMD and is sensitive to respiratory and gastrointestinal abnormalities characteristic of the CF defect. Early evidence suggests global enhancement of NMD, which contribute to low levels of CFTR nonsense transcripts that are expected to limit the efficacy and clinical benefits of readthrough therapy, as seen in CF patients. This model presents a useful tool to evaluate the rescue CFTR expression and function using nonsense mutation directed therapeutic testing in vivo. CF Center, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 2. Physiology, Wayne State Univ., Detroit, MI, USA Animal models of cystic fibrosis (CF) have been instrumental in furthering our understanding of CF pathophysiology. Rabbit models of CF have been developed to capitalize on the following features: 1) high (92%) CFTR sequence homology with humans; 2) body weights sizable relative to human newborns, amenable to equivalent imaging/pulmonary function testing; 4) cost-efficiency, compared to pig and ferret; and 5) absence of airway submucosal glands, ideal to study superficial epithelial-specific contributions. CF\u03941 New Zealand White rabbits developed by the Sun laboratory (homozygous for a single nucleotide deletion creating a premature stop codon in CFTR, i.e., a functional CFTR KO) were imported to UNC, bred, and studied with the goal of extending their lifespan and characterizing their phenotype across multiple sites. CF rabbits did not exhibit perinatal meconium ileus, but over time they develop large intestine/ cecum obstruction/stasis causing significant morbidity and mortality. Starting at two weeks of age, all rabbits were given Golytely (osmotic laxative) instead of water, weighed, and their abdomens palpated for masses (indicative of gut stasis) three times/week. Using this approach, 56% of CF kits survived to weaning (7 weeks). We have developed interventional strategies to reduce post-weaning GI disease. If abdominal masses were detected, rabbits were treated twice a day with: 1) 50 mL SQ warmed saline; 2) PO 0.5 mg/kg cisapride (increases motility of lower gut; 3) PO 0.5 mL/kg simethicone (anti-gas agent); 4) PO 0.5 mg/kg metoclopramide (increases motility of small bowel); and 5) PO 0.5 mL/kg lactulose (a laxative). Treatment continued until masses resolved and was successful in rescuing ~70% of CF rabbits exhibiting gut masses. This strategy allowed us to raise 4 CF rabbits to 1 year of age. As previously reported, the bioelectric phenotype of CF rabbits was consistent with absence of functional CFTR in the GI tract and trachea. CF rabbits also exhibited an elevated nasal basal potential difference (PD) compared to wild-type (WT) controls (-36.3\u00b14.0 mV vs. 8.6\u00b13.1mV, respectively. p\u2264 0.001, n=5), a greater PD depolarization upon amiloride perfusion (\u0394 18.9\u00b11.9 mV vs. 4.4\u00b11.3mV, CF vs. WT respectively), and no response to Clfree buffer. Evidence of olfactory epithelial degeneration was observed in 1-year-old rabbits. At this time, we have not phenotyped sufficient CF rabbits to determine whether the 10% penetrance of muco-inflammatory disease observed in Dr. Sun's lab is also observed at UNC. Using RNAscope in situ hybridization, CFTR expression was detected throughout the WT rabbit distal airway epithelium, similar to humans but not mice, suggesting that CF rabbits may exhibit CFTR-dependent responses to airway challenges. Preliminary data indicate that rabbits infected by respiratory viruses exhibit distal airway muco-cellular obstruction, providing an in vivo model to test the effect of CFTR deletion on viral challenge. Current efforts are geared towards assessing: 1) whether viral infection causes differential incidence/kinetics of muco-inflammatory disease in CF vs. WT rabbits; and 2) whether the nasal cavity of CF rabbits is a useful model to test CFTR modulators.",

Interestingly, the gallbladder also has one of the highest expressions of CFTR relative to other tissues.

In response to secretin stimulation, non-CF organoids decreased in both size and lumen area, consistent with apical membrane localization of CFTR on the outside of the organoid. However, this secretin-induced shrinking response was absent in CF organoids. Inhibition of NHE3, a sodium/proton exchanger, caused both non-CF and CF organoids to decrease in size.

            "text": "Acknowledgments: Supported by NIH and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Not only are multiple organs affected in CF, but the phenotype is difficult to explain solely on the basis of altered anion conductance. A plausible and likely cause of the diverse CF manifestations in multiple tissues is transcriptional dysregulation as a response of CFTR's absence and that genes responding to this dysregulation contribute to disease manifestations. We propose that the transcriptional dysregulation is a consequence of homeostatic mechanisms of the cell that by mobilizing transcriptional machinery to adapt to CFTR's absence, are also influencing other genes in the process, even in tissues where CFTR is not normally expressed, but with whom they share regulatory processes. The CF mouse model allows us to assess this theory without extraneous variation due to genetic heterogeneity. As a model, we used the recently created G542X CF mouse that carries a single nucleotide change in exon 12 of the endogenous mouse Cftr gene and their wild-type (WT) littermates, all male, 7-8 weeks old (C57BL/6J). G542X is one of the five most common CFTR mutations in CF patients. We used RNA from nasal epithelium (3/genotype), whole ileum (4 WT, 5 CF), epididymal fat (5 WT, 4 CF), and PMN (isolated freshly from bone marrow, 3/genotype). RNA-seq libraries were generated using TruSeq stranded Total RNA Ribo-Zero mouse gold kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and sequencing carried out using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 Rapid Run flowcell -2x100 bp run. Reads were aligned to the UCSC mouse genome mm10 using Bowtie2 and Tophat. Differential expression determined with Cufflinks/Cuffdiff. Pathway analysis done with OmicsOffice tools for functional classification (TIBCO Spotfire, Palo Alto, CA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, Broad Institute). The Table shows number of genes per tissue that have FPKM expression \u2265 1, how many genes are differentially expressed and the relative abundance of Cftr. The higher number of genes different in ileum is likely due to different cell types present in the whole tissue. Ongoing analyses include comparisons with other Cftr genotypes. Skeletal muscle and liver samples are next in the pipeline, as well as nasal and tracheal epithelial cells grown in air-liquid interface (ALI). The last two will allow us not only to compare expression between trachea and nasal epithelium, but also to compare expression between freshly isolated nasal epithelium with epithelium grown in culture: both of which will allow us to better understand the human data, since normally we only have access to human nasal epithelium grown in culture. As we add data from all tissues collected, we will be able to identify transcriptional networks altered in CF and gain better tools to understand potential sites of action.

Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic disease where the chloride channel defect in airway epithelium of the lungs is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality and is amenable to topically applied gene therapy. Previous attempts to correct gene expression in the lungs with lipid-mediated vectors, adenovirus and adeno-associated viruses (AAV) vectors have met with limited success. Herein, we characterize an HIV lentiviral (LV) vector pseudotyped with the ebolavirus (EboZ) envelope protein that expresses the luciferase (FLuc) or green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter gene and compare it to AAV2 and VSV-G pseudotyped LV benchmark vectors. Post-nebulization viral vector viability of viral vectors after nebulization by Aeroneb vibrating mesh was 68 \u00b1 6%, 70 \u00b1 11%, and 70 \u00b1 7% of the pre-nebulizer titer for AAV2, VSV-G, and EboZ viral vectors, respectively. eGFP gene transfer to polarized primary air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of human airway epithelial cells was 22 \u00b1 8% AAV2, 19 \u00b1 12% VSV-G and 34 \u00b1 10% for EboZ viral vectors. Immunofluorescent characterization of ALI culture cells transduced by EboZ pseudotyped lentiviral vector expressing eGFP revealed that EboZ vector transduced goblet, club, and ciliated cell types. Bioluminescent imaging of mice dosed with nebulized or intranasally administered viral vectors expressing FLuc demonstrated that luciferase-mediated photon emission was detectable in the lungs of all treated mice. Immunohistochemical eGFP staining of mouse lungs transduced by eGFP expressing viral vectors revealed that alveolar macrophages were transduced by all the viral vectors and only the AAV2 vector transduced airway epithelial cells. This is likely a consequence of the higher dose of AAV2 (2.5 x 10 12 TU/mouse) delivered compared to the dose for the LVs (8.3 x 10 7 TU/mouse). This work demonstrates for the first time that LV vectors delivered to mice by nebulization are capable of transducing alveolar macrophages in the lower airways. Higher epithelial cell transduction efficiency or higher doses are likely needed to transduce airway epithelial cells.",

Nonsense mutations are present in 10% of patients with cystic fibrosis, produce a premature termination codon in CFTR mRNA causing early termination of translation, and lead to lack of CFTR function. There are no currently available animal models which contain a nonsense mutation in the endogenous Cftr locus that can be utilized to test nonsense mutation therapies. In this study, we create a CF mouse model carrying the G542X nonsense mutation in Cftr using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. The G542X mouse model has reduced Cftr mRNA levels, demonstrates absence of CFTR function, and displays characteristic manifestations of CF mice such as reduced growth and intestinal obstruction. Importantly, CFTR restoration is observed in G542X intestinal organoids treated with G418, an aminoglycoside with translational readthrough capabilities. The G542X mouse model provides an invaluable resource for the identification of potential therapies of CF nonsense mutations as well as the assessment of in vivo effectiveness of these potential therapies targeting nonsense mutations. Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections among infants, and these infections are highly associated with infant morbidity and mortality worldwide. RSV infection in early life may predispose children with cystic fibrosis (CF) to worse lung disease later in life. However, the reason for this association is not entirely clear. One hypothesis links neutrophil mediated inflammation as a key risk factor for bronchiectasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of RSV infection on CF and non-CF lung epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that RSV decreases TER in both CF and control epithelial cells and may result from the disruption of epithelial cell junctions. In CF cells, the degree of IL-8 production post-RSV infection is linked to lung function of the CF patients from whom the CF cells were obtained. This suggests the possibility that innate lung epithelial cell immune responses, and specifically IL-8 production, may lead to a more pronounced inflammatory response that could affect lung function in CF patients. CFTR W1282X encodes a premature stop codon after the first third of NBD2 that foreshortens and destabilizes CFTR protein, blunts half-life of the transcript, and omits the carboxy-terminal PDZ anchoring domain, all of which diminish abundance of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Truncated W1282X CFTR exhibits residual activity with a significant CFTR gating defect potentiated by curcumin. G418, an established PTC readthrough agent, has negligible effect on W1282X under conventional in vitro conditions, although prolonged administration at high drug concentrations leads to biochemical evidence of full length CFTR. We also show that G418 unexpectedly stabilizes both wild-type and W1282X mRNA, and increases steady state levels of truncated protein, all of which improve surface localization of wild-type and W1282X CFTR. To further investigate W1282X molecular phenotype, we developed protocols using FRT cell lines encoding wild-type or W1282X CFTR with or without mini-introns surrounding exon 23 (the location of W1282X), and show that W1282X CFTR EMG (expression minigene encoding intronic DNA) produces low levels of protein and mRNA compared to the corresponding cDNA without introns. Augmentation of W1282X CFTR surface protein following treatment with either VX-809 or G418 was found to be much stronger (in proportion) in cells expressing W1282X with mini-introns. Moreover, short circuit current measurements indicate W1282X monolayers chronically exposed to VX-809 or G418 are preferentially enhanced in the presence of intronic DNA. W1282X EMG expression is further increased by the nonsense-mediated decay inhibitor 14 (NMDi14), with stronger activation in the EMG context following co-administration of G418. These findings demonstrate importance of intronic DNA for model systems intended to study W1282X or other CFTR premature truncation variants. Our experiments also emphasize the unanticipated effect of G418 on CFTR mRNA and truncated CFTR protein levels, independent of stop codon suppression, as well as increased full length (wild-type) CFTR following G418 in the FRT model system. We developed a feeder cell-free and serum-free cell culture method (EpiX\u2122), which utilizes small molecules that inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and modulate cytoskeleton dynamics, to achieve more than one trillion-fold expansion of epithelial stem and progenitor cells from skin, airway, mammary, prostate and other epithelia in standard 2D cell culture. EpiX\u2122 medium enables quick expansion of 50-100 millions nasal epithelial cells from CF patients within 3-4 weeks for ex vivo theratyping to identify drug(s) that could benefit individual patients. The approach may be translated to other disorders where theratyping would be beneficial.",

Thus, gene editing of hPSCs would enable development of valuable mutation-customized, fully differentiated, live cultures for CF research and a very powerful platform for tissue-specific CF drug screening.

D) Manually isolating clones from positive populations and rapid clonal AS-PCR screening to identify correctly edited clones. We developed this protocol using a wild-type (WT) human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line, CA1, to produce a homozygous \u0394F508 CF-hESC line using CFTR-exon11 targeting TALENs. We also applied this protocol to correct 3 CF iPSC lines (8K, 4D, Em) homozygous for a nonsense mutation, W1282X, using CFTR-exon23 targeting CRISPR/Cas9. All hPSC populations were efficiently nucleofected and showed 16-37% cleavage at the correct sites by the T7EI assay, indicating TALENs or CRISPR activity in hESC and all iPSC lines, respectively. AS-PCR screening identified \u0394F508 integration or W1282X correction in hESC and iPSC populations, respectively. 604 hPSC clones were manually isolated and the 342 surviving clones (56%) were rapidly screened by AS-PCR.

Thus, our optimised protocol can be applied to hESCs or iPSCs, using TALENs or CRISPR, to introduce mutations for CF disease modelling (\u0394F508) or correct CF-mutations (W1282X) for personalized medicine, respectively, in a 3-6 weeks period.

Organotypic culture systems based on disease-specific iPSCs exhibit obvious advantages compared to immortalized cell lines and primary cell cultures, however, their implementation in high-throughput (HT) assays is technically challenging and as yet there are very few examples of successful conduct of iPSC-based HT drug screens. Here we demonstrate the development of an organotypic Cl -/Iexchange assay based on cystic fibrosis (CF) disease-specific iPSCs for the application of HT drug screening. CF-iPSCs (homozygous for p.Phe508del) were generated via reprogramming of CD34 pos cells isolated from small volumes of nonmobilized peripheral blood. The resulting CF-iPSCs were analysed regarding their karyotype, pluripotency status and differentiation potential. TALEN-based genome engineering was applied for \"footprintless\" correction of the p.Phe508del mutation, and targeted introduction of a fluorescence reporter into the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) locus facilitated the directed differentiation into intestinal epithelia. Moreover the introduction of a halide-sensitive YFP into the AAVS1 safe harbour locus enabled automated quantitative measurement of CFTR function. Reporter iPSC-derived epithelium revealed a CFTR-channel specific response after forskolin application, which was inhibited after CFTR(inh)-172 treatment. CFTR function in CF iPSC-derived epithelia was partially rescued by treatment with VX-770 and VX-809, and seamless gene correction of the p.Phe508del mutation resulted in full restoration of CFTR function. A functional screen of ~ 40.000 small molecule compounds for modulators of p.Phe508del CFTR on a 384-well scale was conducted.

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis patients have a high degree of variability in disease severity, progression and survival. Thus it may not be unexpected that clinical response to CFTR modulator therapy demonstrates individual patient variability. In vitro assays based on experiments performed in patient derived tissues are increasingly being used to identify novel CFTR modulators and predict which modulators may offer benefit for individual patients. Among these patient derived tissues, nasal and bronchial epithelial cells have been identified as they are relatively easy to obtain and may model the CF lung response. However, these cells have a finite lifespan. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are pluripotent stem cells generated from mature somatic cells. These cells contain the genetic information of the individuals from whom the cells are derived and importantly can be passaged indefinitely. Current protocols do exist to transform iPSCs to an epithelial phenotype. However, these protocols are quite complicated and time consuming. A simple method to generate a cell with CFTR function from an iPSC would offer a new model to test CFTR modulators.",

Various cell densities were also tested to maximize cell adhesion. Our results showed that type I collagen + matrigel significantly increases the iPSC attachment. Furthermore, a seeding density of 600,000 cells/cm 2 and a semidry apical surface allow the cells to maintain a monolayer for later induction process.

            "text": "Conclusion: Our initial work suggests that type I collagen + matrigel as a substrate for ALI significantly improves cell adhesion on ALI inserts for later differentiation process. However, Ex media may not be sufficient in inducing club cell differentiation. Furthermore, the use of matrigel, a common matrix for maintaining PSC pluripotency may also hinder this process. Ongoing work will focus on supplementing Ex media with other differentiation factors such as IL-6, which has been shown to promote ciliary cell differentiation, to induce this process. Different matrices such as the laminin series in substitute of matrigel will also be examined. In addition, other intermediary markers will be used to more closely monitor this process. Traditional feeder-free and bovine pituitary extract (BPE)-containing media formulations for the expansion of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) typically support the maintenance of mucociliary differentiation potential for a limited number of passages in culture. A novel culture system comprising an inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layer in combination with a specialized medium has been reported to improve the expansion of HBECs while still maintaining their differentiation potential, even after extended passaging (Liu X, et al. Am J Pathol. 2012; 180:599-607; Suprynowicz F, et al. PNAS. 2012; 109(49):20035-40) . However this feeder-dependent method is cumbersome and undefined, thus limiting its applications. We have developed an improved medium, PneumaCult-Ex Plus, that is feeder-and BPE-free, and promotes extended passaging of HBECs without the loss of their differentiation potential at later passages. The medium allows for the rapid expansion of HBECs, while maintaining their ability to form a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium at an air-liquid interface (ALI) using PneumaCult\u2122-ALI for more passages compared to other commercial HBEC expansion media. To measure cell expansion over multiple passages, commercially available HBECs (Passage 1) were thawed and seeded into T-25cm 2 flasks containing either control media (PneumaCult\u2122-Ex or a BPE-containing medium such as BEGMTM) or PneumaCult-Ex Plus at a density of 1 x 10 4 cells/cm 2 . For each culture period, media were fully replenished three times per week and cells were enzymatically dissociated and passaged once cultures reached approximately 80% confluence. ALI differentiation was performed with PneumaCult\u2122-ALI for HBECs expanded in each of the three test media at different passages. The differentiated cells were functionally characterized by immunocytochemistry, qPCR and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The average fold expansion over 8 passages was significantly higher for the cells cultured in PneumaCult-Ex Plus (11.1 \u00b1 2.4 mean \u00b1 SD, n=4) compared to PneumaCult\u2122-Ex (4.1 \u00b1 1.9, n=4) or to BEGMTM (3.7 \u00b1 1.6, n=4) . HBECs cultured in either PneumaCult\u2122-Ex or BEGMTM could be differentiated into functional pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium only at early passages (P1 and P2). Conversely, cells expanded in PneumaCult-Ex Plus could be successfully differentiated at each passage for at least 4 passages to generate, by 28 days post-air-lift, a functional pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium containing MUC5AC (7.2 \u00b1 2.4%, n=4) expressing goblet cells and AC-tubulin (30.4 \u00b1 5.4%, n=4) expressing ciliated cells. Barrier function was measured weekly by TEER using EVOM. Fully differentiated cultures in PneumaCult\u2122-ALI showed stable TEER (200 -600 \u03a9 X cm 2 ) for at least 25 weeks (n=4). In summary, we have developed an improved defined BPE-free medium for primary human airway epithelial cell culture that promotes greater expansion of HBECs and maintenance of their mucociliary differentiation potential at later passages.

Rats with the 2 mutations are kept under identical clean conditions, and all founder animals were of the same genetic background, making the two models directly comparable. We have observed distinct differences in the severity of CF-related pathologies for these two CFTR mutations.",

Analyses are ongoing, but we expect that the milder Phe508del rat model may develop lung disease at later ages, and will be useful for pathology and treatment studies where airway disease is induced, such as through the use of induced viral and bacterial infections. Rationale: MUC5AC and MUC5B are high-molecular-weight glycoconjugates responsible for the viscoelastic properties of mucus, produced in the lungs to prevent pathogen invasion. In cystic fibrosis (CF), ion fluxes and mucus concentrations are abnormal. As a result, the dehydrated mucus layer compresses the periciliary gel layer, collapsing the cilia underneath and impeding lung mucus clearance. It is fairly well accepted that MUC5AC and MUC5B play a critical role in airway mucus transportability and cough clearance; however, their individual role in health and disease has yet to be determined.",

The data indicate that differences in CFTR expression may contribute to clinical heterogeneity in R117H-CFTR patients. More than 1,700 genetic variants of the CFTR gene have been suggested to cause Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Independently of their mutation class, a large majority of these variants ultimately result in marginal plasma membrane expression of functionally impaired CFTR. CFTR function is dependent upon proper translocation of CFTR to the membrane. Several assays have been developed to monitor CFTR translocation including mammalian cells heterologously overexpressing CFTR-HRP, a recombinant CFTR cDNA with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reporter inserted into its extracellular loop 4 (ECL4). Such high-throughput screening compatible assays have already been successfully used to identify or validate small molecule correctors targeting missense or nonsense variants, e.g., F508del (Phuan PW, et al. Mol Pharmacol. 2014; 86(1) :42-51) or Y122X and W1282X (Liang F, et al. SLAS Technol. 2017; 22(3) :315-24). However, these artificial systems that are based on an overexpression of cDNA, exclude the native CFTR promoter and intronic sequences, and therefore, are poorly suited to study CFTR dysfunctions caused by mutations located in introns and/or affecting splicing, expression regulation, nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD), etc. To overcome these limitations, we aimed to create a more biologically relevant model, a cell line with the HRP reporter inserted into the genomic CFTR locus at the ECL4/exon-17 encoding region.",

NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA LMTK2 is a transmembrane kinase known to bind to and phosphorylate CFTR. We determined if LMTK2 was able to regulate CFTR-dependent chloride and fluid transport using murine enteroids as a functional model. Enteroids were made from wild-type (wt) and LMTK2 -/-mice. Enteroids from LMTK2 -/-mice were able to form in a similar fashion to organoids from wt mice, however the number and complexity of developing crypts was lower in LMTK2 -/-mice compared to wt enteroids. This is likely due to a reduction in ISC, as the stem cell marker Lgr5 was lower in LMTK2 -/enteroids compared to wt. Functional assays were performed using microscopic evaluation of forskolin induced swelling. Following CFTR activation and fluid transport enteroids from wt mice showed a marked rapid swelling that eventually plateaued at 40 times the original lumenal volume, while LMTK2 knockout organoids showed a forskolin-induced increase of only 18-fold the orginal lumenal volume. Enteroids from LMTK2 -/mice were responsive to forskolin but showed a significantly lower rate of swelling and a markedly lower final plateau. Swelling was lost from both wt and LMTK2 -/-enteroids when the samples were incubated with CFTRinh172, indicating that the swelling was indeed due to CFTR. No significant difference in CFTR mRNA levels between wt and LMTK2 -/enteroids was observed, suggesting that the loss of CFTR-mediated chloride and fluid transport was due to altered subcellular trafficking of CFTR rather than a diminution in CFTR protein. These data identify LMTK2 as a viable therapeutic target for abnormal fluid transport in diseases such as cystic fibrosis and secretory diarrhea. Defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) of pancreatic ducts leads to abnormal pH regulation in the ductal lumen. The resulting premature activation of the digestive enzymes secreted into the ductal lumen by pancreatic acinar cells leads to tissue necrosis. Our previous studies on pancreatic pathology in CFTR-knockout (KO) ferrets indicate age-dependent changes in acinar tissue, inflammation, fibrosis, adipogenesis, and islet frequency (Am J Pathol. 2018;188(4):876-90). Additionally, islets harvested from CFTR-knockout (KO) newborn ferret pancreas demonstrate reduced islet insulin and lower glucose stimulated insulin secretion likely in part due to enhanced IL-6 secretion from islet-associated ductal cells (Endocrinology. 2017;158(10):3325-38). However, paracrine factors from the pancreatic ducts that influence insulin secretion and their mechanism of action is largely unknown. To this end, we have developed an air-liquid interface polarized primary ductal epithelial cell culture system from newborn wild-type (WT) and CFTR-KO ferrets. The basolateral and apical secretions from the polarized epithelia, upon stimulation with carbachol or IBMX/forskolin, were analyzed by mass spectrometry using \"light\" and \"heavy\" stable dimethyl isotope labeling for the quantitation. The fold-change (FC) of proteins enriched in \"heavy\" labelled CFTR-KO secretions versus \"light\" labelled WT secretions were determined by calculating the area under the curve of the \"heavy\" and \"light\" labeled isotopic peptides (in N=6 animals of each genotype). Initial gene ontology (GO)-term analysis on the CFTR-KO secretions indicated enrichment of immune response and inflammatory processes. Apical secretions had 19 and 28 differentially secreted proteins by CFTR-KO epithelia following carbachol or IBMX/forskolin, respectively. In basolateral secretions, 21 and 7 proteins were differentially secreted by CFTR-KO epithelia following carbachol or IBMX/forskolin, respectively. Paracrine factors, known to influence insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion included insulin growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7; log FC -8.68), thioredoxin (TXN; log FC -2.30), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; log FC -11.35), and thrombospondin 1 (THSB1; log FC 13.25) were among those differentially secreted by the CFTR-KO ductal epithelium compared to WT (p < 0.05). This comparison of CF and non-CF ductal secretomes should prove useful in identifying paracrine factors that impact islet function in CF and hence will aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to aberrant islet insulin secretion in CF.

The input video -in AVI format -contains the images of different slices of a set of organoids at different time, captured by a confocal microscope and codified in 5D format. The parameter file -in TXT format -contains the values of some parameters used by the algorithm: 1. the number of slices sampled by the microscope, 2. the minimum area (in pixels) of the organoids to be detected, 3. a real-valued threshold on the intensity values of the organoids to be detected (related to the fluorescence), 4. an integer number related to the \"physical\" separation (minimum distance) among the organoids, and 5. a flag to display these instructions (0 = no, 1 = yes). The program displays an interactive image, where the boundaries of the organoids are shown in red color. Organoids of interest are selected by the user with a mouseclick. Volume computation follows this step. For each selected organoid, CORVO outputs: 1. the time, 2. the area of the maximum slice, and 3. two estimations of the organoid volume, called the topological and the intensity based volumes of the organoid: the topological (intensity based, resp.) volume is the sum over the slices of the pixels (of the pixel intensity) of the region corresponding to the organoid.",

Previous studies have shown that transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) is reduced in CF bronchial epithelial cells over-expressing F508del-CFTR compared to wild-type CFTR.

Splice switching antisense oligonucleotide (SSO) technology has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy in personalized medicine to modify gene expression by modulating pre-mRNA splicing. One splicing-related mutation in CFTR is the 3849+10kb C>T splice mutation. The 3849+10kb C>T splice mutation creates a de novo 5' splice site resulting in the inclusion of a cryptic exon. This cryptic exon contains a stop codon thereby causing the translation of a truncated CFTR protein ending at amino acid residue 1254. We have designed an SSO to target the cryptic splice site created by 3849+10kb C>T mutation. Treatment with the SSO blocks cryptic splicing and increases the abundance of full-length CFTR mRNA in both patient lymphoblasts homozygous for the splice mutation and primary bronchial epithelial cells from a compound heterozygote patient with the 3849+10kb C>T splice mutation and \u0394F508. Importantly, SSO treatment increases cAMP-activated chloride secretion in differentiated primary patient-derived bronchial epithelial cells measured by an equivalent current (Ieq) assay utilizing a TECC-24, demonstrating that the SSOs can restore CFTR function. When analyzed in comparison to current FDA approved CF drugs ivacaftor (VX-770) and ivacaftor/lumacaftor (VX-770 in combination with VX-809), SSO treatment resulted in a greater increase in CFTR function compared to that achieved with either treatment alone. Together, our results demonstrate the ability of SSOs to correct aberrant splicing in the 3849+10kb C>T CFTR splice mutation as measured by an increase in the abundance of full length mRNA as well as the partial restoration of functional protein activity.

CF is caused by mutations in CFTR that result in decreased protein production and function of the chloride channel. Mutations in CFTR most severely affect the lung, causing a build-up of thick mucus and increased susceptibility to infection. As a result, lung disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. While many symptomatic treatments exist, quality of life and life expectancy for CF patients are low, and better therapies to improve CFTR expression and function are in need.

Genetics, Yale, New Haven, CT, USA Introduction: Advances in noninvasive genetic testing allow for prenatal disease detection using cell-free fetal DNA obtained from maternal blood as early as 7 weeks of gestation (Nature. 2012; 487:320-4) . Despite the possibility of early diagnosis, many neonates and children with CF suffer substantial morbidity and mortality as currently available therapies do not correct the underlying gene defect. There is a growing consensus that treating CF patients early is crucial in preventing or delaying irreversible organ damage. Even at birth, there are signs of multi-organ disease, evidenced by the occurrence of pancreatic insufficiency, reduced birth weight, meconium ileus, tracheomalacia, biliary cirrhosis and absence of the vas deferens. We hypothesize that early intervention through in utero gene editing could correct mutations during the initial stages of pathogenesis, which could allow for normal organ development, disease improvement, and possibly cure. We previously showed that site-specific gene editing to correct the F508del mutation can be achieved efficiently and safely in adult animals via intranasal administration of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and donor DNA (Nat Commun. 2015; 6:6952) . The aim of this study was to demonstrate that NPs can be safely delivered to developing fetal mice and that NPs loaded with PNA/ DNA can correct the F508del mutation in utero, resulting in sustained postnatal CFTR function.",

Our findings represent the first systemic in utero correction of a CFTR mutation and establish the feasibility of a fetal gene editing approach that could be used in the treatment of numerous CF disease-causing mutations. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Although CF affects multiple organ systems, chronic bacterial infections and inflammation in the lung are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. Gene complementation with a functional CFTR gene repairs this defect, regardless of the disease-causing mutation. In this study, we used a gene delivery system termed piggyBac/adenovirus (Ad), which combines the delivery efficiency of an adenoviral-based vector with the persistent expression of a DNA transposon-based vector. We aerosolized piggyBac/Ad to the airways of pigs and observed widespread pulmonary distribution of vector. We quantified the regional distribution in the airways. We observed transduction of large and small airway epithelial cells of non-CF pigs, with ~30-50% positive surface epithelium. We transduced multiple cell types including ciliated, non-ciliated, basal, and submucosal gland cells. In addition, we phenotypically corrected CF pigs following delivery of piggyBac/Ad expressing CFTR as measured by anion channel activity, airway surface liquid pH, and bacterial killing ability. Combining an integrating DNA transposon with adenoviral vector delivery is an efficient method for achieving CFTR functional correction from a single vector administration.",

Cell Biology and Physiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA In the normal lung, chloride secretion via the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and sodium absorption through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are required to maintain airway surface liquid (ASL) volume homeostasis. The importance of this mechanism is highlighted during cystic fibrosis (CF) pathophysiology, where an imbalance in ion transport results in ASL volume dehydration. SPX-101 is a novel peptide-based ENaC antagonist developed in our laboratory that restores ASL height in CF human bronchial epithelial cultures (HBECs). SPX-101 prevents absorption of a test bolus of solution in CF HBECs. However, whether SPX-101 can induce ASL secretion in alreadydehydrated CF cultures remains to be determined. To test this hypothesis, we added SPX-101 as a dry powder in perfluorocarbon to dehydrated CF HBECs, without an additional volume load. Thus, any changes in ASL height would be caused by the induction of secretion, and not due to an inhibition of absorption. The addition of SPX-101 induced a 2-fold increase in ASL height in a dose-dependent manner in CF (\u0394F508 homozygote) airway cultures (n=9). This effect was abolished by bumetanide, an inhibitor of the basolateral Na + /K + /2Cltransporter (n=9). Furthermore, this was not an osmotic effect since it was not reprised by the scrambled peptide (control). We hypothesize that SPX-101, via inhibition of ENaC, hypoerpolarizes the apical membrane to induce anion secretion in CF HBECs via a CFTRindependent pathway. Importantly, these data suggest that SPX-101 is mutation agnostic and may be able to rehydrate CF airways in the absence of CFTR correctors or potentiators. However, the nature of the chloride efflux pathway in CF epithelia remains to be identified.",

Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 4.

The consequent CFTR dysfunction results in obstruction of small airways and airway inflammation and eventually leads to respiratory failure. Recently, a number of CFTR correctors and potentiators, improving membrane expression and gating of the channel respectively, have been developed, but their ability to rescue the basic defect of CF is still unsatisfactory.",

In vitro, the peptide potentiates F508del-CFTR currents upon pharmacological correction with VX-809 and, unlike the gold-standard potentiator VX-770, does not interfere with channel stability in the chronic setting. In VX-809-corrected primary cells, the peptide also synergizes with VX-770, by increasing its efficacy by 5-fold and is able to stabilize the CFTR to the plasma membrane.",

VIP is a potent vasodilator and bronchodilator that among other functions regulates exocrine gland secretions by controlling CFTR-dependent chloride secretion, thereby contributing to mucus hydration and local innate defense of the lung. In cystic fibrosis, we found an intriguing marked reduction in VIP around submucosal glands of the lung, pancreas and sweat glands of CF mice, as well as a marked reduction in VIP amount in the small intestine that is related to reduced VIPergic innervation.",

Of these, 168 are nonsense mutations, 295 are frameshift mutations that are not amenable to current therapies, and therefore new drugs must be developed. Antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) are synthetic RNA analogues that can be designed to anneal to selected splice motifs within pre-mRNAs. AO binding alters the recognition of the splice site by the spliceosome and therefore modulates exon selection. Exon 15 has been selected as an initial target since it has been reported to harbour ~40 mutations and exclusion of this exon will not disrupt the mRNA reading frame. We hypothesize that by skipping exon 15 in patients with amenable mutations such as p.Phe861Leufsx3, studied here, the disease-causing mutation can be bypassed and the induced isoform may retain some residual function, therefore altering the course of disease.",

Inhaled amiloride accelerated mucociliary clearance (MCC) in clinical studies, but with a half-life in the airway mucosa of <30 minutes, it was a short acting effect which did not translate into clinical efficacy. To achieve a long duration of action in the clinic with novel inhaled ENaC blockers, it will be necessary to maintain compound levels in the airway lumen at a concentration that will maintain target engagement for a sufficient period of time.",

A key element of the optimisation phase was to understand lung-specific pharmacokinetics, and how these related to in vivo efficacy. To this end, two key models were used. The first employed intratracheal delivery of test compound into the lungs of rats with sampling of compound levels in the airway, lung tissue and plasma. Compounds were then tested for duration of action and efficacy in the sheep model of MCC.",

ETD001 did however show a long residence in the airway lumen of the rat, which was accompanied by a potent and long lasting acceleration of MCC in the sheep following inhaled delivery. Other, more potent examples of novel ENaC blockers, showed significantly greater on-target potency (<5 nM) but failed to show efficacy in the sheep, which could be correlated with a diminished retention of compound in the airway lumen.",

Pulm, Children's Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA Background: CFTR knockout mice have increased right ventricular torsion and strain in the absence of lung disease (J Cyst Fibros. 2016; 15:34) . Despite substantial improvements in care, patients with CF often develop pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) leading to pulmonary hypertension. The extent to which subclinical PVD contributes to decline in exercise tolerance and quality of life (QOL) in patients with CF is unknown. Identifying those CF patients with PVD prior to onset of right ventricular dysfunction may allow early pharmacologic intervention. Clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil can decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and improve exercise tolerance in non-CF patients.",

Alfred Hosp, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Introduction: CF patients (pts) with F508del/minimal function (F/ MF) genotypes do not have approved CFTR modulator therapy. Adding a next-generation (NG) CFTR corrector to a corrector/potentiator regimen may substantially improve CFTR function in F/MF pts and enhance benefit over 2-drug regimens in F508del/F508del (F/F) pts.",

University Of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA; 4. Celtaxsys, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: The chronic inflammatory component of CF lung disease causes lung injury and lung function decline, leading to morbidity and mortality in people with CF. There are no therapies approved by regulatory authorities for inflammation in CF and previous studies show CFTR modulators do not consistently impact underlying lung inflammation. Acebilustat is a once-daily oral LTA4 hydrolase inhibitor which reduces sputum LTB4, neutrophil DNA and elastase levels, and serum CRP in CF patients (Elborn JS, et al. Clin Transl Sci. 2017; 10:28-34) . In CF patients, we hypothesized acebilustat would decrease lung inflammation, reduce the frequency of CF exacerbations, and diminish lung function decline.",

Key inclusion criteria were age 18-30 years, screening FEV 1 percent predicted (pp) \u226550%, and \u22651 pulmonary exacerbation in the past year. At randomization, patients were stratified by baseline FEV 1 pp (50 to 75% and >75%), number of exacerbations in the 12 months before screening (1 or >1) , and concomitant use of CFTR-modulators (yes/no). Patients were enrolled from 69 sites across North America and Europe.

Phase 3 studies are ongoing to support further development of VX-659 TC regimens. Aberrant pulmonary mucus accumulation and infection are signature traits in CF patients. Mucus plays a vital role in host defense by transporting bacteria out from the lung. MUC5B and MUC5AC are the principal mucin proteins that facilitate mechanical clearance in healthy airways by forming ordered polymers. In contrast, CF airways are characterized by highly concentrated mucus layers. We hypothesize that the origin of this thick immobile mucus in CF airways results from altered structural organization of MUC5B and MUC5AC proteins caused by depletion of water. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of mucin polymer formation in normal versus pathological states is crucial for designing alternative therapies for CF. Previously, Thornton and coworkers reported that the association of adjacent VWD3 domains located in N-terminal region via disulfide bonds drives MUC5B polymer assembly. Despite these studies, absence of accurate atomic-level descriptions of mucin proteins impedes the molecular underpinnings of the polymerization processes of mucins in the lung. Here we generate a potential physiological structural model of the MUC5AC N-terminus using a multilevel computational-experimental methodology. We employ multiple sequence analyses, homology modeling and protein-protein docking techniques for initial model building. Available structural data (e.g., glycosylation sites, cysteine residues known to form disulfide bonds) are applied both for structure validation and as experimental constraints in molecular dynamics simulations for refining the preliminary structural model. This high-resolution structure may serve as a platform to determine the molecular mechanisms of polymerization of MUC5AC protein associated with normal and CF conditions; and reveal sites near oxidated cysteine residues (important for creating intra-and inter-molecular disulfide network in oligomeric states). Molecular description of these sites can expedite the search and design of thiol-based drugs with high efficacy while minimizing off-target interactions and toxicity. Background and Objectives: The most common \u0394F508-CFTR mutation results in either the proteasomal-degradation or movement of misfolded CFTR protein into perinuclear aggresome-bodies. Presence of misfolded protein activates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that impairs autophagy, exacerbating proteasomal overload and chronic accumulation of \u0394F508-CFTR and other crucial regulatory proteins into aggresome-bodies. Additionally, in CF, the thick airway mucus-buildup, repeated respiratory infections, and chronic lung inflammatory-oxidative stress, together form the physio-chemical barriers that restrict effective drug delivery. Autophagy-inducing FDA-approved drugs such as cysteamine have shown some therapeutic efficacy in CF subjects. In order to overcome these physio-chemical hurdles of drug delivery, a nanoparticle-based drug delivery approach that has shown some promise in CF in our pre-clinical studies was utilized. Briefly, in the present study, we aimed to test a novel nano-formulation with autophagy-inducing antioxidant drug cysteamine (CYS), where we modified the terminal amine groups of cationic dendrimer to form a \"cysteamine-like structure\" along with an encapsulated drug (cysteamine conjugates) inside the amine surface-decorated dendrimer.",

Furthermore, cysteamine's known antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against Pa were enhanced as our findings demonstrate that both G4-CYS and its control dendrimer, G4-DAB, exhibited significant (p<0.05) bactericidal activity against Pa over the course of an 18-hour bacterial survival. We also found that both G4-CYS and G4-DAB exhibit marked mucolytic activity against porcine mucus (p<0.05).

Employing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing, a series of cell lines were generated based on the 16HBE14o-cells*. The models resemble primary human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells with respect to low CFTR expression, reduced mRNA of PTC variants, and functional expression of CFTR. Inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by inhibiting SMG1 rescues the mRNA levels of CFTR G542X and W1282X. The readthrough modulator G418 leads to functional expression of CFTR in the G542X model.

Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive liprotamase or pancrelipase (Pancreaze\u00ae), with the pancrelipase dose initially matched to the pre-study PERT dose in lipase units, and the liprotamase dose at least 25% higher. Based on clinical signs and symptoms of malabsorption, and if sanctioned by a blinded assessor, subjects were allowed dose adjustments during the first 3 weeks up to 10,000 units lipase/kg/day for those under 12 years, and up to 15,000 units lipase/kg/day for those 12 years and older. CFA and CNA were evaluated at Week 4. The primary endpoint was the between group difference in least square (LS) mean change from baseline in CFA, with a noninferiority margin of -15% for the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI).",

The differences in CFA, dose adjustments and withdrawals suggest that optimal lipid absorption in patients with CF-related EPI treated with liprotamase remains to be achieved. Objective: Early stages of deficient pulmonary physiology are hard to monitor in CF without invasive procedures or radiation. Our method, 3D single breath hold chemical shift imaging (3D-SBCSI), is sensitive to early signs of disease progression using MRI and hyperpolarized Xenon-129 gas, which is inert and nonradioactive.",

This correlated well with VD and showed local V/Q mismatches. Tissue/RBC, RBC/Gas, and Tissue/ Gas ratios correlated well with iron concentration and transferrin saturation in blood (|R|>0.70). Two severe CF subjects (S1, S2) had similar FEV1 but different iron levels; with lower iron, Tissue/RBC was higher, Tissue/ Gas was about the same, and RBC/Gas was lower ( Fig D) . The RBC peak shifted more as disease progressed and iron level decreased, indicating a reduced capacity to bind oxygen (Kaushik SS, et al. J Appl Physiol. 2014; 117:577-85; Norquay G, et al.

The impact on longitudinal LCI measurements needs to be further explored. Bacterial specific imaging agents have the potential to distinguish infection from other etiologies such as sterile inflammation or cancer. For patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a bacterial imaging agent could identify the location of the highest bacterial burden and additionally may allow monitoring of antimicrobial treatment efficacy.

Ivacaftor therapy resulted in a significant increase in pulmonary function and FeNO at the one-month time point and remained increased over the 2-year follow-up. L-arginine (substrate for NO synthases; NOS), and ADMA (NOS inhibitor) levels in sputum showed a transient decrease after 4 weeks but the L-arginine:ADMA ratio, an index of NOS impairment, previously demonstrated to be reduced in CF airways, remained unchanged. Similarly, sputum L-ornithine (product for arginase activity) was decreased initially following ivacaftor initiation; however, the ratio of L-arginine:L-ornithine, used as an index of L-arginine availability for NOS, remained unchanged throughout the observation period. NO metabolites in sputum did not change over time. When including all measurements, FeNO correlated with FVC (r=0.29, p=0.01), FEV 1 (r=0.41, p<0.001) and FEF50 (r=0.76, p<0.001), but changes in FeNO did not correlate with changes in PFTs over time.

Background: Pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging using hyperpolarized 129 xenon gas (XeMRI) can quantify ventilation inhomogeneity by measuring the percentage of unventilated lung volume (ventilation defect percent; VDP) in stable pediatric CF patients (1) . The utility of XeMRI to monitor response to therapy in CF has never been assessed.

            "text": "Iron is an essential element in human cells due to its redox-cycling capacities. Iron levels must be tightly regulated to avoid free iron toxicity via catalysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by host cells. ROS activate intracellular redox-sensitive inflammatory pathways and subsequent generation of inflammatory cytokines. Importantly, it has been documented that iron homeostasis is markedly dysregulated in the lungs of CF patients (Ghio A, et al., J Cyst Fibros. 2013; 12:390-8) . To better understand the impact of iron on the inflammatory response of CF airway epithelial cells, DIBI, a novel, highly-specific synthetic iron chelator was used in our in vitro study. We hypothesized, that iron chelation by DIBI could reduce the inflammatory response of CF epithelial cells triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram-negative bacteria cell walls. JME/CF-15 cells, a nasal epithelial cell line derived from a F508del homozygous CF patient, were grown on Transwells with differentiation media. To establish the inflammatory response, once polarized, cells were stimulated with LPS under various conditions. Incubating the cells with 200 ng/mL of LPS for 24 hours resulted in significant apical IL-6 secretion of JME/CF-15 cells (measured by ELISA of cell culture supernatant). DIBI administration (100 or 200 \u00b5M) significantly reduced LPS-induced IL-6 secretion by 25% or 69%, respectively. With Bradford assays, we verified similar protein content in all experimental groups (control, DIBI, LPS, LPS+DIBI). JME/CF15 cell response to LPS was compared to the response of a standard bronchial epithelial cell line, Calu-3. We found that much higher doses of LPS (5 -10 \u00b5g/mL) were necessary to illicit a comparable inflammatory response with Calu-3 cells (measured by increase in IL-6 secretion) compared to JME/ CF15 cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that polarized JME/CF15 cells are more sensitive to LPS than non-CF epithelial cells. This inflammatory response can be modulated by iron sequestration using the novel iron chelator, DIBI. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of iron chelation as a novel approach for attenuating the dysregulated inflammatory response in CF airways.",

The correlation between LCI and 129 Xe MRI suggests that both assess similar functional components of CF lung obstruction. 129 Xe MRI has spatial sensitivity which may be leveraged for planned procedures like bronchoscopy or to evaluate regional therapeutic response for individual CF patients. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CF patients have defects in ion transport in epithelial cells. Persistent inflammation and infection in CF airway deteriorate lung function profoundly, leading to CF morbidity and mortality. Traditional medical therapies treat only symptoms but not the cause of the disease. Current CFTR-directed drugs, such as ivacaftor, are effective for only a small portion of patients, and the combination of drugs, such as ivacaftor and lumacaftor, has some efficacy for about half of the CF patients. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies for targeting all types of mutations are needed. Our laboratory has been developing CRISPR/Cas9-based gene targeting strategies for permanently correcting CF lung disease. We produced helperdependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors which can deliver gene editing tools for integrating a functional CFTR gene into a genomic safe harbor of pig cells. The objective of this project is to test our CFTR gene targeting strategy in cultured CFTR-deficient pig cells in vitro as well as pig airway in vivo.",

After generating a CFTR-deficient cell line, HD-Ad vector which contained K18 promoter and human CFTR cDNA was transduced into CFTR -/cells.

Both FLIPR and Ussing chamber assays detected increased hCFTR channel-mediated conductance followed by forskolin stimulation in HD-Ad-hCFTR transduced cells. Meanwhile, the inhibition of hCFTR channel conduction was detected by adding CFTR inhibitor (CFTRinh-172). Our study showed that the hCFTR could be functionally expressed in the pig cell line by HD-Ad vector-based delivery. These results showed the potential of HD-Ad vector mediated hCFTR gene transfer strategy to functionally rescue CFTR mutations. Our next step is to integrate the hCFTR transgene specifically into a pig genomic safe harbor, GGTA1 locus, using CRISPR/Cas9 packaged HD-Ad vector. Introduction: There are approximately 2000 mutations that have been identified in the CFTR gene. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated nuclease 9 (Cas9), a gene editing tool, is being explored as a possible therapy for CF. A guide RNA (gRNA) directs the Cas9 nuclease to the genomic target site. The Cas9 nuclease then induces a double-strand break (DSB) in the genome which is then repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR). HDR uses homologous DNA sequences for repair and can be used to introduce exogenous DNA. Helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors are the preferred choice for the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system as they have a large carrying capacity and a tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. In addition, HD-Ad vectors lack most viral genes, which may result in a reduced immune response. Our strategy is to use HDR induced by the CRISPR-Cas9 system to integrate a human CFTR minigene at the human CFTR locus, at the same time preventing expression of the mutated CFTR gene.",

Therefore, prevention of PEx remains a clinical priority. Azithromycin is efficacious in reducing PEx risk in CF children and adolescents without chronic P. aeruginosa infection (Saiman L, et al. JAMA. 2010; 303:1707-15 ). However, it does not benefit all patients and there are potential side effects related to its use.

Acknowledgment: Supported by CFFT (QUON15UO). Introduction: L927P CFTR is a rare missense mutation that has no effective CFTR modulator therapy and is not currently included in modulator trials. Though typically considered a conduction (class IV) mutation, characterization is limited. Here we report in vitro CFTR function and response to modulation from human nasal epithelial cells (HNEs) derived from 2 siblings with the L927P/F508del CFTR genotype. These female siblings (ages 16 and 19 years) were receiving supportive CF therapy including dornase alfa, nebulized hypertonic saline, and inhaled antibiotics. Pancreatic status was insufficient based on fecal elastase testing. Sweat chloride concentrations were >100 mmol/L and maximal FEV1 in the year prior to testing was 94% and 77%, respectively. Over the year prior to testing, both siblings had frequent exacerbations and decline in FEV1. Thus, we sought to determine if CFTR modulator therapy could be beneficial for this mutation.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to have antiinflammatory, antifibrotic and antimicrobial activity both in vivo and in vitro. We have shown that hMSCs decrease inflammation and infection in a murine model of CF lung infection and inflammation which resulted in the first in CF Phase I Safety Trial. Clinical trials of hMSCs have shown no major adverse events, but modest benefits are sometimes observed due to donor hMSC variability and differences in disease specific clinical targets. The major clinical issue in CF is related to uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation and infection. In these studies we pursued an hMSC optimization strategy, with the goal of enhancing potency and efficacy for specific CF clinical endpoints. Real-time PCR and Luminex technology was utilized to follow hMSC gene expression and ability to produce effectors in response to manipulation to a variety of effectors such as IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Functional endpoints included monitoring the hMSCs for antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activity in vitro using our estabslished potency models. Using this format we have identified two different combinations of stimulants based upon their ability to enhance hMSC antimicrobial (hMSC AM ) and anti-inflammatory (hMSC AI ) potency. The hMSC AM and hMSC AI treated cells augmented antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with the relative potency sequence of hMSCs AM > hMSC AI >hMSCs not-treated >no hMSCs. The AM and AI combination enhanced hMSCs anti-inflammatory potency as measured by PGE 2 and indomethacin production with the relative potency rating of hMSC AI >hMSC AM >hMSC not-treated >no hMSCs. Taking advantage of the murine model of CF lung infection and inflammation, we investigated the in vivo potency of the hMSC AI and hMSC AM preparations compared to hMSCs not-treated and no-hMSC controls to manage infection and inflammation in the model. Cftr -/mice chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and infused with hMSC (regardless of hMSC treatment) had better weight retention and improved clinical score compared to Cftr -/mice not treated with hMSCs. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) evaluation of infection and inflammation status of the hMSC treated Cftr -/mice demonstrated that the hMSC AM and hMSC AI augmented the beneficial therapeutic impact of hMSC not-treated in vivo with a greater decrease in inflammation and infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization was decreased by 70-80% with the sequential impact of hMSC AM >hMSC AI >hMSC not-treated > no hMSCs (n=3, p<0.05). BAL white cell counts were consistent with the level of infection, with hMSC AI >hMSC AM >hMSC not-treated > no hMSCs (n=3, p<0.05). These studies demonstrate that optimization of hMSCs for inflammation and infection endpoints specific in CF pathophysiology has the potential to enhance therapeutic impact for clinical benefit. Our current efforts are focused on optimzing CF hMSCs and refining to a minimum effector combination.

Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, USA Introduction: Chronic bacterial lung infections are a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease and are difficult to eradicate. Chronic lung infections result in chronic lung inflammation and oxidative damage which creates a paradox where most anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapies can suppress an already inadequate lung immune response. Clinical trials using inhaled antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or glutathione have reported only modest benefits in CF subjects. A potential better approach in CF would be to develop an antioxidant that can also supplement the innate immune system. We have previously reported the beneficial effects of supplementation with the small pseudohalide thiocyanate ( -SCN) in a mouse model of CF lung infection and inflammation. The object of this study was to evaluate the use of -SCN as a counter anion for a manganese porphyrin catalytic antioxidant AEOL10150, which could increase the parent compound's antioxidant spectrum and supplement the lung's innate immunity.",

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting from mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR is responsible for proper movement of chloride and bicarbonate ions across the apical cell surface. Defective CFTR results in an absence of bicarbonate transport, which functions in part to chelate Ca 2+ , a divalent cation found in abundance in mucin granules in normal conditions; this yields a hyperviscous and adhesive mucus on the respiratory tracts of patients with CF. A novel therapeutic, PAAG, is a polycationic derivative of polyglucosamine that is a soluble, nontoxic polysaccharide shown to interact with mucins. Previously, we demonstrated that PAAG improves the viscoelasticity and transport of CF sputum, CF HBE mucus, and purified MUC5B. We have also recently shown that the CF rat displays increased airway mucus viscosity and delayed transport at 6 months of age, allowing for the evaluation of novel mucoactive agents such as PAAG.",

The results show that the combination of cysteamine and EGCG is considerably more potent a treatment than when they are used separately. Introduction: Hyper-inflammation drives the irreversible lung tissue damage in CF patients. Macrophages (M\u03a6s) mutated at the CFTR contribute to the hyper-inflammation and defective host defense in CF lung disease. Heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (HO-1/CO), a key signaling pathway involved in resolving inflammation, is dysregulated in CF M\u03a6s and murine CF lungs in response to infection. HO-1 is an inducible enzyme that degrades heme groups, producing anti-inflammatory mediators, such as carbon monoxide (CO), which help to resolve inflammation. CO also has potent bactericidal activity and, in a positive feedback loop, increases endogenous HO-1 expression. The HO-1 pathway is an attractive target for disrupting the hyper-inflammatory response in CF. PEGylated carboxyhemoglobin bovine (Sanguinate\u00ae, SG) is a CO-releasing molecule in a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether SG improves resolution of inflammation while strengthening host defense in CF by acting on the HO-1/CO pathway.",

Hyperproduction of mucus, gradual decline in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and persistent hyperinflammation have long been recognized as the age-related pathologies of CF. Fenretinide (FEN), a derivative of vitamin A, has been shown to revert the proinflammatory imbalance of fatty acids and ceramides in CF mice and to inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway in cancer cell lines and macrophages. Lung infection with P. aeruginosa induces the production of both MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins in the lungs.

            "text": "Results:Our data demonstrate that young CFTR-KO mice do not differ from their wild-type (WT) littermates in the production of mucus at the baseline. Their production of mucus upon bacterial infection is similar to the WT. However, uninfected older CFTR-KO mice show a much higher degree of infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lungs than WT, which can be prevented by FEN treatment. We also show that CF-KO mice display higher methacholine-induced airway resistance than WT and that FEN treatment efficiently corrects this defect. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that FEN treatment efficiently regulates the total production of mucus in the lungs of P. aeruginosa-infected mice. Finally, FEN treatment also prevents the LPS-induced increase in MUC5AC expression, without affecting the level of MUC5B gene expression in the SPOC-1 cell line.",

It also demonstrates the impaired lung physiology in CFTR-KO mice compared to their littermate control, which can be improved following FEN treatment. Overall, the protective effects of FEN treatment on CF lung disease and lung physiology as well as FEN-induced selective modulation of LPS-induced production of MUC5AC provide further support for the use of this therapy to prevent the progression of CF lung disease. Rationale: Exercise capacity is an important outcome parameter for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is a strong predictor of prognosis. Lumacaftor-ivacaftor (Orkambi\u2122) improves FEV 1 percent-predicted (ppFEV 1 ) over 24 weeks and improvements are observed within the first month of treatment. It is unknown if this lung function benefit translates into improvements in exercise endurance, exertional dyspnea, or leg discomfort ratings. Accordingly, the primary purpose of this study was to determine the effects of lumacaftor-ivacaftor on exercise endurance and perceptual responses to exercise following the first month of treatment.",

Co-incubation of amphiphilic peptides with recombinant GFP-NLS protein yielded rapid (minutes) and efficient nuclear GFP-NLS delivery in cultured well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells, human tracheal explant tissue, and the large and small airway epithelia of mice.

Amphiphilic peptide transduction of firefly luciferase protein into conducting airway epithelia of mice, followed by bioluminescent imaging revealed that delivery was rapid and restricted to the respiratory tract.

Our results lay the foundation to manipulate CFTR in vivo and to assess safety and efficacy of miRNA antagonism to augment CFTR correction in rodents. (3DP) is an evolving technology that creates a physical model from a virtual 3D model. Wide range of materials including plastics, metals, biopolymers and biological cells can be used to create patient-specific models, implantable devices, and tissue engineered grafts (Parthasarathy J. Ann Maxillofac Surg. 2014;4:9-18). Over the past two decades, applications of 3DP have centered on dental, CMF plastic reconstructive surgery. Recent advances include orthopedic, cardiac, and neurosurgical specialties (Heller M, et al. Int J Comput Dent. 2017; 19:323-39) . Patient-specific anatomical models (PSAM) created by 3DP are a powerful adjunct to diagnosis, treatment planning, patient education and physician training. We recently used it as a means to assess progression of lung disease in research studies. Models provide an understanding of the spatial relationship of lesions to adjacent anatomical structures, critical in treatment planning. We describe 3Dmodeling and 3DP of PSAM of the CF lung.",

Data was imported into MIMICS software (Materialise, Belgium) in DICOM format. Within MIMICS segmentation region-growing algorithm was performed on individual 2D slices. The software then converted the segmented DICOMs into a 3D model representing the structural anatomy of the lung and the pathological fibrosis region with the cysts. Complete segmented lung were then exported as. STL files and sent to the 3D printer via GeomagicFreeform software (3DSystems,USA) for production.

Rationale: Bronchiectasis and structural airway injury begin early in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF). PRAGMA-CF is an imaging score sensitive to detect early airway injury but requires significant scorer training. Our objective is to develop automated software to score the proportion of visible airways on chest CT scans as a surrogate of airway injury.

AAI was calculated from the volumetric inspiratory chest CT as the proportion of these pixel regions that were scored as \"airway\" out of the total number of lung regions tested. Sensitivity and specificity for the algorithm to classify \"airways\" based on Apollo airway imaging was calculated. Student's t-test was used to compare AAI between CF and disease control.

Hubrecht Organoid Technology (HUB), Utrecht, Netherlands; 3. Clinical Development, Eloxx Pharmacuticals, Waltham, MA, USA Approximately 13% of patients with cystic fibrosis carry at least one nonsense allele in their CFTR and have limited treatment options. ELX-02 is a designer eukaryotic specific ribosome glycoside (ESRG) with improved translational read-through properties and decreased affinity for the prokaryotic and mitochondrial ribosome. In a previous study, when tested with organoids from cystic fibrosis patients carrying homozygous or compound heterozygous nonsense mutations (HUB), ELX-02 showed up to 60% dose-dependent forskolin induced swelling (FIS) in homozygous G542X and W1282 organoids with a slight additive effect noted for VX-770 and up to 40-60% and 40% (respectively) dose-dependent swelling in heterozygous \u0394F508/G542X and \u0394F508/R1162X organoids with slight to no additive effect noted for VX-770. In these assays the swelling response varied among organoids with the same mutation. To help understand the varied responses, mRNA levels were measured from organoids used in the FIS assay. QPCR was performed on both homozygous and heterozygous organoids from cystic fibrosis patients to define any potential correlation between a swelling response and mRNA levels. ELX-02 (100 \u00b5g/ mL) increased total and relative wild-type (WT) CFTR mRNA (2-4X) levels in compound heterozygous \u0394F508/G542X and W1282X homozygous organoids. Additionally, the results show a strong correlation between increased mRNA levels and FIS-induced swelling assay in both the compound heterozygous \u0394F508/G542X (up to 40% swelling) and W1282X homozygous (up to 60% swelling) organoids. The robust response in the FIS assay correlated with increased total and relative (WT) CFTR mRNA levels. These data suggest mRNA levels vary across individual patients with the same cystic fibrosis nonsense mutations. This variability may be due to differential nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in different individual patients. As a consequence, ELX-02 potentiation of functional CFTR translational readthrough in patients with nonsense mutations may be influenced by mRNA levels. The ALBATROSS study aims to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GLPG2222 in CF patients who are on stable treatment with ivacaftor. GLPG2222 is a novel CFTR corrector, partially rescuing F508del CFTR, in clinical development for the treatment of CF Methods: ALBATROSS is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, to evaluate two qd doses (150 mg and 300 mg) of orally administered GLPG2222 for four weeks in ivacaftortreated subjects with cystic fibrosis harboring one F508del CFTR mutation and a second gating (class III) mutation. Male and female subjects aged \u2265 18 years with CF and percent predicted FEV 1 (ppFEV 1 ) \u2265 40% were eligible for inclusion. Subjects were on stable ivacaftor treatment for at least 4 weeks and remained on ivacaftor during the study.",

It provides accurate information regarding muscle mass and adipose tissue allowing for singular or longitudinal assessments over time. This information can be used to improve our understanding of LBM and its correlation with lung function and patient outcome. We propose that calculating muscle volume and density on CT imaging would correlate strongly with FFMI and HGS. This could provide important information to centres where HGS and FFMI testing is lacking.

The leading cause of morbidity and mortality is chronic lung disease. Most current treatments focus on symptom management and treating secondary disease complications, and few therapies are available that restore CFTR function. Lentiviral vectors are attractive tools for gene therapy because they integrate into the host's genome, which ensures lasting gene correction. CFTR gene addition using lentiviral vectors has shown promising results in CF pigs when the vector is aerosolized in the airways.

Cystic fibrosis airway disease is caused by airway dehydration related to the dysfunction of mutant CFTR, resulting in buildup of thick mucus and an inability to clear it from the airways. Simply put, CFTR potentiators improve the function of classes 3 -5 CFTR mutants while CFTR correctors improve trafficking of F508del CFTR, a class 2 mutant. These CFTR modulators are not expected to be active in patients with nonsense mutations (class 1). Brevenal is a small molecule with activity in mucociliary clearance that potentiates calciumactivated chloride channel (CaCC) currents through TMEM16A or ANO-1. In this study, we examined the activity of brevenal in fully differentiated patient-derived cystic fibrosis human bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells with nonsense mutations in at least one allele (G542X/F508del, G542X/R1162X and R1162X/Unknown). These cells were treated with brevenal, either 500 nM basolaterally or 1 \u00b5M apically. ASL depth was measured using meniscus scanning. Basolateral application of 500 nM of brevenal (n=7, from 2 lungs with G542X/F508del and R1162X/unknown) significantly reduced ASL absorption over 24 hours. Brevenal was formulated for apical administration via nebulization similar to our previous in vivo application with cyclodextran. Two-dimensional lateral diffusion of FITC-labeled 70 kD dextran was measured in the ASL on CFBE cells from G542X/ F508del and F508del/R1162X donors by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). One hour after apical administration of 1 \u00b5M brevenal, the half-life (t 1/2 ) of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was reduced compared to control. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured after FRAP analysis via SAVA software. CBF significantly increased 2 hours after apical administration of 1 \u00b5M brevenal. Taken together these findings indicate that by potentiation of TMEM16A activity brevenal corrects the defects of ASL volume and rheology characteristic of mutated CFTR. Alternatively, brevenal may have effects independent of ion transport through apical channels. In either case, the beneficial effects on parameters of mucociliary function seen in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that brevenal may be useful for the treatment of CF airway disease, especially for patients with nonsense mutations currently not amenable to CFTR modulator therapy. Oropharyngeal swabs are much more easily obtained, and the oropharynx may serve as a source of lower airway microbiome constituents through micro-aspiration, especially during infancy. The potential for the oropharyngeal microbiome to serve as a noninvasive, informative biomarker in early stage CF respiratory disease warrants further investigation. To date, studies of the microbiome in CF have largely depended on 16S sequencing, which is less informative than metagenomics shotgun sequencing (MGS). Unlike 16S, MGS is capable of identifying viruses and fungi, as well as species-level identification and functional capabilities of the microbiome constituents. We present metagenomic sequencing data from oropharyngeal swabs from infants with CF.",

Acknowledgment: Sponsored by Translate Bio, Inc. Ten percent of all cystic fibrosis (CF) patients carry an in-frame premature termination codon (PTC), which leads to the production of truncated, nonfunctional CFTR protein. Compounds have been identified that can suppress termination at PTCs (also called readthrough (RT)) and partially restore the synthesis of full-length protein. However, the amount of full-length CFTR restored by current RT agents is insufficient to correct the CF phenotype. In collaboration with Southern Research (SR), highthroughput screening (HTS) was performed to discover new, efficient RT compounds. Initially, an FDA-approved 1,600-drug library was screened using luciferase-based RT reporters. Using identical RT reporters, eight compounds were identified to induce RT in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells compared to only two in HEK293 cells, suggesting that FRT cells represent a highly sensitive cell line for identifying RT compounds. Due to their responsiveness, FRT cells were chosen for screening a much larger 775,000-compound library. By using a permissive cell line, we anticipated that the RT effects displayed in FRT cell lines might not necessarily be replicated in other cell lines, such as human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. However, the molecular structure of the initial RT hits could be modified to increase RT in other cell lines. For example, SRI-37240, a hit from the 775,000 HTS, increased RT in FRT cells up to 10-fold, but it was not active in immortalized 16HBE14o-cells. However, SRI-41315, a derivative of SRI-37240, induced a 15-fold increase in RT in 16HBE14ocells. This indicates that FRTs represent a good cell line for performing an initial HTS since we are less likely to miss any potential scaffolds that are active for RT. We also compared the level of RT induced in 16HBE14oand primary HBE cells by the G418 aminoglycoside control. Current results suggest that similar levels of RT are generated in both cell lines, indicating that RT data correlates well between the cell lines.",

Compounds may be identified that not only induce RT, but also inhibit NMD. Theoretically, these dual function compounds have the potential of restoring higher levels of CFTR function than compounds that induce RT alone. We have developed and characterized NanoLuc-based reporters to identify compounds that induce RT and also stabilize CFTR mRNA. The potential of these compounds is currently under investigation. In addition, we are testing SRI-41315 in CFTR-G542X mice to verify its ability to induce RT in vivo. Overall, it is hoped that this approach will identify compounds that can be developed into a therapy for CF patients who harbor a PTC. The goal of this project is to construct a reporter system that measures termination efficiency at premature termination codons (PTCs) versus normal termination codon (NTCs) in order to test whether readthrough (RT) compounds affect PTCs and NTCs differently. Here, we have generated a luciferase-based reporter system which differentiates termination at PTCs and NTCs and are stably expressed in Fischer Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells. The initial characterization of the reporters has been conducted using RT drugs and knockdown (KD) of UPF1, UPF2, UPF3b and PABPC with siRNAs.

Interestingly, G418 at a 300 mg/mL dose induced higher RT at the PTC. To examine whether the adjacent proteins around PTCs or NTCs may affect termination efficiency, we are generating KD of these proteins using siRNAs. We are currently investigating the effect of UPF1, UPF2, UPF3B and PABPC KDs alone on RT of a PTC versus NTC, and in combination with G418 treatment. Plus, we are also building additional constructs in which a spacer gene, lac Z, is inserted in order to increase the distance between the PTC or NTC and poly(A) tail to better understand the difference of RT at PTCs and NTCs.",

The eight RT hits increased RT at the PTC reporter by 10 to 25-fold, while all eight hits only increased the RT at NTC 3 to 4-fold. These results show that all these RT compounds induce higher RT at the PTC than at the NTC in reporter cells. Overall, we believe these reporters will provide valuable new information about the specificity of RT agents for future drug development. Introduction: Chronic airway inflammation is a major pathogenic factor of CF airway disease. Airway macrophages (AMs) contribute to CF airway inflammation by producing inflammatory mediators. The spliced (active) form of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1s) is a potent transcription factor required for cytokine [e.g., interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)] production in human CF AMs. Moreover, the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is associated with inflammatory responses in macrophages and its expression is increased in AMs from CF mice. Sphingosine-1 phosphate kinase 1 (SPHK-1), a kinase that phosphorylates the sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine-1, is involved in immune responses and associated with increases in inflammatory mediators. Vardenafil (VAR), a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, decreases lung inflammatory responses in F508del CF mice, but it is not known whether VAR blunts XBP-1s, cytokines, NOS2 and SPHK-1 levels in human CF AMs.",

SMM up-regulated XBP-1s, NOS2, and SPHK-1 mRNA levels and stimulated IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion in both non-CF and CF AMs. VAR decreased SMM-up-regulated XBP-1s, NOS2 and SPHK-1 mRNA levels, and SMM-increased IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion in non-CF and CF AMs. These data are summarized in the Table. Conclusions: VAR attenuates IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion induced by the infectious/inflammatory CF airway milieu in non-CF and CF AMs. These responses are associated with decreased XBP-1s, NOS2, and SPHK-1 expression. Our findings suggest that VAR may be therapeutically beneficial for counteracting the robust airway inflammation of CF patients. Acknowledgment: Funded by the CFF. CFTR is an ion channel expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Mutations in CFTR cause CF, a disease in which the encoded CFTR suffers from severe folding, functional, and stability defects. The CFTR-associated ligand (CAL) is a regulatory protein that directly interacts with post-endocytic CFTR and targets it for lysosomal degradation (Cheng J, et al. J Biol Chem. 2004; 279:1892-8) . Although there are FDA-approved drugs that improve CFTR folding and function (e.g. tezacaftor and ivacaftor), there are no available therapeutics that directly address the instability of mutant CFTR. Previously, we have shown that selectively perturbing this interaction (via delivery of a competitive peptide inhibitor) leads to increased expression and function of CFTR at the apical membrane (Cushing P, et al. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2010; 49:9907-11) . However, the therapeutic potential of our first-generation CAL inhibitor has been limited by its modest affinity for CAL (Ki = ~40 \u00b5M). Using a host of biochemical, structural, and computational approaches, we reengineered our inhibitor and incorporated non-natural amino acids and chemically-modified scaffolding residues. Without loss of specificity, we enhanced the affinity for CAL by 10-fold (Ki = ~4 \u00b5M). We also screened >50,000 small molecules from which we identified a subset of compounds that bind to and inhibit CAL. One promising lead inhibits CAL with 1 \u00b5M affinity and shows no cellular toxicity at therapeutic concentrations. Complementing existing CF therapies with a CFTR \"stabilizer\" (i.e. CAL inhibitor) may offer a novel approach for augmenting lung function in a broader spectrum of CF patients.",

The F508 deletion in CFTR is the most prevalent mutation present on at least one allele in 90% of CF patients. Maximal restoration of F508delCFTR requires two corrector molecules with complementary mechanisms, type 1 (C1) and type 2 (C2), to increase CFTR at the cell surface, in combination with a potentiator (P) to increase channel activity (1) .

ARO-ENaC, Arrowhead's first therapeutic candidate to employ the pulmonary epithelial delivery platform, has been advanced as a novel treatment for cystic fibrosis lung disease. Furthermore, the ability of the EpL-RNAi platform to facilitate functional delivery of RNAi triggers to the airway suggests that additional therapeutic targets in the pulmonary epithelium could be considered, particularly those that are currently inaccessible to traditional small molecule or antibody approaches. In CF, airway dehydration and abnormally viscous and adhesive mucus are thought to cause a profound decrease in mucus transport, precipitating progressive lung disease. Characterizing mucus transport abnormalities in CF patients has been difficult, particularly at the cellular level, due to the limitations of current imaging tools in patients. We have recently developed an imaging technique called micro-optical coherence tomography (\u00b5OCT) that obtains cross-sectional images of tissue reflectance from the airways in real time at 1 \u00b5m resolution. Here, we investigate whether the intensity of \u00b5OCT images of mucus is a reliable indicator of sputum viscosity.",

Introduction: Loss of function of the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare disease affecting multiple epithelia including the airways. A mRNA replacement therapy offers many advantages to treat CF patients including: no risk of genomic integration, bypassing the cell's transcriptional regulation and the ability to use the cell's translational machinery to produce complex proteins. Arcturus' LUNAR \u00ae lipid-mediated technology has the potential to deliver functional copies of CFTR mRNA into airway epithelial cells and thereby restore the normal airways physiology in CF patients, an approach that is CFTR mutation agnostic.

The selective delivery of nebulized formulations into the murine lung epithelial cells validates Arcturus' LUNAR \u00ae technology as a potential lipid-delivery platform for CF. Codon-optimization is a feasible approach to develop improved CFTR sequences with higher protein levels and active chloride channels that might be beneficial for quick mucus clearance in CF patients' lungs. We are currently establishing the efficacy and translatability of our LUNAR \u00ae technology in other animal models with clinical relevance for CF. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) impacts ~50% of adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and is one of the most important extrapulmonary complications in CF. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a primary pathophysiologic feature of CFRD; is 2-3 times more prevalent in CF patients than in the general population; and is also caused by recurrent use of nephrotoxic drugs such as antibiotics and immunosuppressants following lung transplant surgery (Quon BS, Aitken ML. Paediatr Resp Rev. 2012; 13:206-14) . Therefore, accurate monitoring of kidney function is an important component in the care of CF patients and is likely to increase in importance as the CF patient population continues to age. Unfortunately, current clinical assessments of renal function (i.e., serum creatinine) are known to be insensitive to early-stage CKD. We have previously shown that diffusion tensor imaging -magnetic resonance imaging (DTI-MRI) can sensitively detect early-stage CKD in other patient groups (Lu L. Am J Nephrol. 2011; 34: 220-5) . Therefore, in this initial study, we evaluated the capability of DTI-MRI to detect early-stage CKD in CF patients with clinically normal kidney function in comparison to healthy, non-CF control subjects.",

Spyryx Biosciences, Durham, NC, USA Introduction: Decreased mucocillary clearance due to mucus dehydration is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway hydration is regulated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and its natural regulator short palate lung and nasal clone 1 (SPLUNC1). There are reports that SPLUNC1 is decreased in the sputum of CF patients. This suggests that loss of SPLUNC1 could play a major role in mucus dehydration associated with CF. We have developed a novel ENaC regulatory peptide, SPX-101, that can replace SPLUNC1 function. This work investigates the abundance of SPLUNC1 in sputum from healthy (no diagnosed pulmonary disease) and CF donors, the stability of SPLUNC1 and SPX-101 in these sputa and against individual proteases. The functionality of SPX-101 after exposure to diseased sputum and individual proteases was also assessed.",

The correlation between ppFEV1 and patient-reported outcomes is critical for incorporating measures of treatment benefit into the evaluation of new CF treatments. We analyzed the correspondence of ppFEV1 with 8 symptom-based questions from the Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary-Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score (CFRSD-CRISS). Understanding the relationship of these measures is necessary for planning intervention trials and interpreting outcome measures.

The lack of correspondence between direct patient-reported symptoms and ppFEV1 suggests that both measures are needed to evaluate clinical response and that these measures likely capture different aspects of the disease. Further work is needed to determine other phenotypic clinical responses that could be used. Premature termination codons (PTCs) in CFTR result in truncated protein that is nonfunctional and/or unstable, and are the proximate cause of ~11% of CF-causing alleles. High-throughput screening campaign of 750,000 compounds was carried out to identify and develop compounds that induce PTC suppression of mutant CFTR. Since PTC-containing mRNAs are subject to degradation through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), agents that concomitantly inhibit NMD are also of interest for optimal promotion of full-length protein expression and function. Three lead hits, SRI-37240, SRI-38711, and SRI-40003 have demonstrated efficacy in inducing translational readthrough in fluorescence reporters (Du M, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2018; 53(S2) :254[abstract]) and restoring CFTR expression and function as assessed via transepithelial chloride conductance assay (TECC) in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells stably transduced with CFTR-G542X, -W1282X, and -R1162X cDNA. FRT cell monolayers were pretreated with different doses (1-60 \u00b5M) of each compound and G418 (250 \u00b5g/mL) as a positive control. Scaffolds represented by the original hits SRI-37240 and SRI-38711 restored CFTR activity up to ~30% of wild-type (WT) in different FRT PTC mutations, as previously reported. The new scaffold SRI-40003 reached ~5% of WT activity (0.91 \u00b1 0.01 mS/cm 2 ) in FRT G542X cells, and ~10% in both FRT W1282X (2.13 \u00b1 0.04 mS/cm 2 ) and FRT R1162X (2.16 \u00b1 0.11 mS/cm 2 ), at maximum dose as compared to vehicle (P<0.05). VX-809 (3 \u00b5M) addition to SRI-40003 doubled (10-20% WT) the CFTR signal in each of these mutations, indicating an additive effect by restoring function to the resulting missense alleles. Enhanced G542X-CFTR protein expression levels in the presence of SRI-40003 were strongly correlated to functional readouts (R 2 =0.98). Several lead scaffold derivatives are currently being evaluated in FRT G542X cells and demonstrated strong structure-activity relationships, allowing optimization of potency and efficacy. Of particular interest are SRI-41315 (~10% WT, EC50=0.8 \u00b5M), SRI-41765 (~17% WT, EC50=1.4 \u00b5M) and SRI-41876 (EC50=3.4 \u00b5M) derivatives of SRI-37240, SRI-40003 and SRI-38711 respectively. To augment readthrough-mediated CFTR expression, double (SRI agents + CFTR modulators/NMD inhibitors) and triple combination (SRI agents + CFTR modulators + NMD inhibitors) strategies are being explored in primary gene-edited 16HBE14o-(G542X/G542X; W1282X/W1282X) cells with endogenous CFTR context produced by CFFT, immortalized hTERT G542X/G542X cells, and intestinal organoids from nonsense mutation patients. Initial results reflect successful detection of readthrough in primary cell systems, and additional optimization is underway. In conclusion, SRI agents, with and without combination therapy, augment CFTR expression and function in CFTR PTC mutations, and have the potential to accelerate progress in this challenging area of CFTR restoration.

In Jan 2018, we started our HTS campaign to identify small-molecule modulators using epithelial cell lines that transiently express both YFP and TMEM16A. Known activators and inhibitors have shown dose-dependent effects in our assays. Our assays were designed to screen for both TMEM16A boosters, compounds that can boost the expression of TMEM16A in the cell membrane, and TMEM16A activators, compounds that can instantly activate TMEM16A. Cells were either incubated with testing compounds for 24 hours or 15 minutes before being subjected to a YFP Iion flux assay in 384-well format. With a pace of over 30,000 compounds per week, we have collected hundreds of primary screen hits, both TMEM16A boosters and TMEM16A activators. Many of the primary hits were confirmed by our full-dose response validation screen. Confirmed hits will be further validated in patch-clamp experiments and in primary human bronchial epithelial cell assays. Introduction: The glycoproteins MUC5AC and MUC5B are the predominant gel-forming mucins which, with DNA (derived from host cells and colonising microorganisms) and lipids, are thought to be the primary contributors to the rheological properties of the thixotropic matrix which is cystic fibrosis sputum. Physiotherapy and the development of mucolytic and osmotic therapies attempt to tackle this problem in different ways. Cysteamine is a simple aminothiol for which we have already demonstrated antibiotic potentiating properties (Fraser-Pitt D, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2016; 60:6200-6; Fraser-Pitt D, et al. Infect Immunol. 2018; 86(6) ) but which also has sputum-thinning and biofilm-disrupting properties (Charrier C, et al. Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2014; 9:189; Devereux G, et al. EBioMedicine. 2015; 2:1507-12) . Here we demonstrate that cysteamine targets cysteines of the von-Willebrand regions in gel-forming mucins in a distinct way to existing thiol mucolytics.",

Infect Immunity. 2005; 73:2504-14) . We are now implementing the alginate infections in comparison to agar bead infections using in vitro and in vivo models of CF, including CFBE41o-monolayers and Scnn1b-Tg mice that overexpress ENaC. Thus far we have developed a method to extract pseudomonad alginate and are comparing this to agar beads, which primarily induce chronic infection by hypoxia induction and slow release; nonbacterial alginate beads will serve as an additional control. Outcomes will focus primarily on biofilm production, cytokine analysis and histopathology. These studies will investigate the role of alginate in the persistence of chronic PsA infection and determine whether alginate may play a role in creating a superior model of chronic CF respiratory infection and if novel mucolytics and biofilm disrupters, such as PAAG, are effective in mitigating them.",

Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; 6. Laurent Pharmaceuticals, Montreal, QC, Canada The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a tightly regulated anion channel that mediates cAMP-stimulated secretion and is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF). Severe inflammation and chronic bacterial infection are hallmarks of CF lung disease and cause much of the morbidity and mortality in CF, however the relationship between CFTR function and inflammation remains poorly understood. Several lipid abnormalities have been observed in CF. Very long-chained ceramides (VLCC; C24:0, C26:0), which are considered anti-inflammatory, are reduced, whereas pro-inflammatory long-chained ceramides (LCC; C16:0, C18:0) are increased in CF and may contribute to progression of the disease. Fenretinide (FEN), an exploratory semi-synthetic retinoid, has been shown to reduce inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness in a CF lung disease model. It also enhances clearance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the lungs of CF mice and re-balances levels of LCC, VLCC and other fatty acids in CF patients and mice. Although fenretinide (LAU-7b oral capsules) has been tested as a first-in-class lipid modulator of inflammation in a Phase 1b clinical trial in adult CF patients and is currently cleared for Phase 2 by both FDA and Health Canada, its effects on CFTR membrane distribution and function have not been investigated.",

We also examined the impact of FEN treatment on CFTR channel function in Ussing chambers. All studies employed a low concentration similar to that measured in the plasma of FEN-treated CF patients. Although FEN did not alter the membrane distribution of wt-CFTR on primary airway epithelial cells under control conditions, it did enhance the partitioning of CFTR into ceramide-rich microdomains during cell stress, suggesting that CFTR recruitment inside these domains may be part of the host defense response that leads to increased pathogen clearance and/or the resolution of inflammation. Short circuit currents (I sc ) mediated by both wt-and F508del-CFTR were increased significantly (30-120%) in a concentration-and time-dependent manner by treatment with FEN. Since we have shown previously that the distribution of CFTR on primary airway epithelial cells depends on membrane lipid composition, the FEN-induced enhancement of functional CFTR expression, at least in part, may be mediated by the rebalancing of fatty acids and ceramide levels in the airway epithelial cells. These results highlight the importance of membrane lipids as determinants of CFTR membrane distribution and function and provide insights into the potential role of CFTR in regulating inflammation resolution and bacterial clearance. Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Background: There are currently several novel CFTR modulators under study, particularly in early-phase clinical trials. Such trials typically are of short duration; for example, two Phase 2 multi-center clinical studies of a triple-combination (TC) CFTR modulator regimen had only one-month treatment periods. Although participation in clinical trials has long been a focus for many CF centers, little has been done to compare health outcomes before participation in brief trials with acute clinical outcomes afterwards.",

CF providers might consider prophylactic escalation in therapeutic management of their adult CF patients after brief CFTR clinical trial treatment or other clinical interventions potentially exposing patients to clinically significant fluctuations in CFTR function. This may avoid acute respiratory changes possibly affecting longer term well being. The natural history of CF remains one of progressive lung function decline and premature death. To date it remains an elusive goal to predict future changes in the health of people with CF. Previous attempts at survival analysis have used static pre-defined risk factors to develop models to predict outcomes.

We are studying a novel antibiotic approach that uses the metal gallium (Ga) to disrupt bacterial iron metabolism. Gallium has a nearly identical ionic radius as iron, and many biologic systems are unable to distinguish gallium from iron. Gallium disrupts iron dependent processes because Ga 3+ cannot be reduced and redox cycling is critical for iron's biological function. Pre-clinical studies show that gallium kills P. aeruginosa (Pa), is active against Pa biofilms in vitro, and treats three different animal models of chronic Pa infections. We tested intravenous (IV) gallium in people with CF and chronic Pa lung infections in a phase 1b safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) study. Gallium treatment appeared safe, had favorable PK, and produced improvements in lung function as measured by FEV 1 and FVC.",

The primary outcome measure was the difference between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects with a 5% or greater relative change in FEV 1 (liters) from baseline to Day 28. Key secondary outcome measures included safety, change in sputum P. aeruginosa density, the emergence of other CF pathogens, and respiratory symptoms using the Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary -Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Score (CFRSD-CRISS).",

Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA The major hurdle with gene therapy is the development of neutralizing antibodies in response to repeat delivery that could potentially block expression of enough CFTR to be therapeutic. Given that the turnover of airway epithelial cells may make gene transfer with recombinant AAV-based vectors transient, repeat dosing of AAV1 pseudotyped virus will ultimately be required. The goal is to assess whether repeat dosing of AAV1-CFTR vectors administered to primates leads to widespread gene transfer and CFTR expression. To test this, we sprayed into the airways of 2 healthy male and 2 female Rhesus monkeys 5 years of age, 2 doses of 10 13 vg of AAV2-1-\u039427-264-CFTR at 0 and 30 days, respectively, followed by a single dose of 10 13 particles of AAV2-1-GFP at day 60. A similar construct \u0394264-CFTR was shown to increase endogenous CFTR in Rhesus macaques via transcomplementation. Monkeys were sacrificed at day 90. This protocol was designed to evaluate the immune response to the AAV1 capsid and the level of expression of the transduced proteins. Both males and females gained weight normally. Likewise, there were no adverse events related to the study indicating that triple dosing with AAV1 vectors is safe. Neutralizing antibody titers were measured in serum and reported as the highest serum dilution that inhibited AAV1 transduction by 50%, when compared to its own AAV1 vector-positive/serum-negative control. All animals used in the study had low neutralizing anti-capsid antibodies (<5 reciprocal dilution, RD) at the beginning of the study. The levels increased in all animals to approximately 380, 30 days after the first dose. Neutralizing antibody titer increased to 1600, 30 days after the second dose of AAV1-\u039427-264-CFTR and to greater than 5000 after the third dosing of AAV1-GFP. Samples were taken for vector genomes in lung regions. At necropsy, approximately 2x10 6 vg/\u00b5g DNA was detected for CFTR and 5x10 5 vg/\u00b5g DNA for GFP. Both AAV1-CFTR, 2x10 6 vg/\u00b5g DNA, and AAV1-GFP, 4x10 6 vg/\u00b5g DNA were present in the liver. Widespread immunostaining for CFTR and GFP were detected in trachea, bronchi, and alveoli indicating that transduction of AAV1-CFTR and GFP occurred. Significant expression of both CFTR and GFP were noted throughout the lung. In conclusion, repeat dosing of AAV1 into the lung of Rhesus macaques is safe but leads to increases in neutralizing antibodies against the vector capsid. Detection of GFP protein expression following two doses of AAV1-CFTR suggests that even though increases in neutralizing antibodies are evident, transduction by AAV1 based vectors still occurs throughout the airway. Funded by CFF and NHLBI. Cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory infections are polymicrobial and difficult to treat. Accumulating evidence suggests interspecies competition and cooperation are key determinants of microbial survival during infection and influence patient outcomes. Our patient studies reveal coinfection with the two most prevalent and problematic pathogens in CF, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, correlates with poor lung function and increased frequency of pulmonary exacerbations. Accordingly, cocultivation of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in vitro dramatically alters each species' tolerance to antimicrobials and production of virulence factors. However, whether these pathogens spatially interact during CF pulmonary infection in a manner sufficient to drive interspecies interactions influencing lung function is unclear. Here we sought to answer this question through fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) labeling of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in ex vivo respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were fixed and optically cleared such that the structure of each respiratory sample and associated microbial community could be maintained and three-dimensional community images were acquired using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Prior to fixing, a section from each sample was homogenized and plated on selective medium to enumerate colony forming units for each species. For each sample determined to be culture positive for both organisms, mixed aggregates of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus could be visualized in close proximity. To understand how these polymicrobial communities form, in vitro assays were designed to visualize and tract single P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cells prior to the development aggregate formation. We observed that P. aeruginosa can sense the presence of secreted products from S. aureus from a distance. Upon sensing S. aureus exoproducts, P. aeruginosa responds by increasing both flagella and type-IV pili (T4P) mediated motility and travels directionally towards S. aureus. Upon arrival at a growing S. aureus colony, P. aeruginosa adopts a unique T4P-mediate motion whereby it orients its cell body perpendicular to the S. aureus colony, moves back-and-forth along its long axis and \"burrows\" into the S. aureus colony. P. aeruginosa motility is then decreased and depending on the strain and nutritional conditions, P. aeruginosa will either kill S. aureus or form a commensal-like mixed microcolony. Fluorescent reporters for key P. aeruginosa genes important for motility, chemotaxis, and biofilm formation were constructed and imaged by time-lapse microscopy. P. aeruginosa strains deficient in the corresponding genes were also analyzed by microscopy and in traditional macroscopy motility assays in the presence of cell-free S. aureus supernatant. It was determined that these behaviors are controlled at various levels by P. aeruginosa chemotaxis systems (Che and Pil/Chp) and the second messengers cAMP and c-di-GMP. We propose that by understanding how mixed microbial communities form, we may design therapeutics to disrupt formation of communities which have detrimental effects for patients and conversely, bring those together which might possess beneficial interactions. Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium linked to morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). P. aeruginosa infects nearly 60% of all CF patients, with up to an 80% prevalence in adults with CF. Once it is established in the airways, P. aeruginosa is nearly impossible to eliminate. In response to the alarming increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, recent research efforts have centered upon disrupting quorum sensing (QS) as an alternative therapeutic approach. QS is a chemical communication system employed by P. aeruginosa and another prominent CF pathogen, Burkholderia cenocepacia, to express a wide array of virulence factors necessary for establishing infection. In gram-negative bacteria, QS is often mediated by acyl-homoserine lactone (HSL) signal molecules. P. aeruginosa possesses two complete acyl-HSL QS systems: LasR-I and RhlR-I. In studied strains of P. aeruginosa, LasR regulates RhlR in a \"cascade hierarchy\" of QS, and mutations in the lasR gene functionally inactivate QS. Mutations in lasR are common in CF patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, which has dampened enthusiasm for QS inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. However, we have recently shown that the cascade hierarchy of QS is altered in CF isolates and that RhlR mediates QS in many LasR-null isolates.",

This disadvantage of RhlR mutants occurs through killing of RhlR mutants by the parent strain. Together, these observations support the notion that RhlR may be a more relevant and effective therapeutic target than LasR for treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa infections. Introduction: Upon inhalation, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) adapt to the airway, form biofilms and cause chronic pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Although persistent infection is commonly associated with damaging inflammation and mucus accumulation, we postulated that it is the presence of succinate released from activated airway immune cells that is a major factor in the adaptation of PA to the CF lung.",

The CF strains of PA were less immunogenic mutants that failed to induce succinate secretion by host phagocytes. These mutants failed to activate the inflammasome, an intracellular immune signaling complex that uses succinate to stabilize HIF1\u03b1 and secrete IL-1\u03b2. Phenotypic, genomic and qRT-PCR analyses of these CF isolates confirmed that these strains were either mucoid or small colony variants (SCV).

In addition, patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection had a shorter time to next oPEx. Bacteria in chronic infections often reside in communities composed of micron-sized, highly dense aggregates (~10 1 -10 4 cells). However, how these structured communities form or the role they play in chronic infection is unknown. Although the aggregate mode of growth is associated with increased tolerance to host immune functions and antimicrobial therapies, a primary challenge has been the lack of laboratory systems in which to study aggregates that promote natural aggregate formation in relevant environments. We developed an in vitro model based on chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, which promotes natural aggregate formation by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). When cultured in synthetic CF sputum media (SCFM2), PA readily forms aggregates of similar sizes to those observed in CF lung tissue. In combination with high resolution microscopy and micro-3D-printing, we have established SCFM2 as a platform to observe the assembly of microbial communities, in three-dimensions, in real-time and at the micron-scale. We have exploited this system in two ways; first, to elucidate the life history of PA and the mechanisms that this bacterium utilizes to tolerate antimicrobials, specifically bacteriophage. Our results reveal that this bacterium readily forms aggregates that release migrants to colonize new areas. We show that aggregates allow PA to tolerate therapeutic bacteriophage addition, in part due to exopolysaccharide production; however, seeding of new aggregates by dispersed migrants was inhibited. We propose a model in which aggregates provide a mechanism that allows PA to tolerate an antimicrobial during chronic infection without the need for genetic mutation. Secondly, we assessed interactions between aggregates. As a highly social organism, PA interacts both with itself and other microbes that co-inhabit the same environment. One manner in which PA communicates is via quorum sensing (QS), a phenomenon thought to be critical for emergence of in vivo microbial communities. What remains unanswered is whether such signalling occurs as a localized event (intra-aggregate) or at the community level (inter-aggregate). To answer this question, we used a mixture of micro-3D-printed and naturally formed SCFM2 aggregates to explore the \"calling distance\" of QS signals. We found that signaling in SCFM2 is primarily intra-aggregate, with only aggregates of > ~5000 cells able to engage in inter-aggregate signaling. In turn, this \"calling distance\" is impacted by the physical properties of CF sputum. These studies provide benchmark data on the physical requirements required for bacterial tolerance and communication in an environment similar to the CF lung. Using SCFM2 as a model for studying aggregates will allow us to further explore PA chronic infection in the CF lung, from a clinical, evolutionary and ecological perspective, at the finer scale of an individual aggregate. Bacterial-viral co-infections are recognized as a cause of morbidity in chronic lung disease, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Polymicrobial infections occur frequently in the CF airway, but the underlying mechanisms of how viral-bacterial interactions mediate pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In CF patients, clinical observations link the acquisition of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa with respiratory virus infections. Recently, we demonstrated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, and the subsequent innate immune antiviral interferon (IFN) response, promoted biofilm growth of P. aeruginosa. In the current study, our goal was to evaluate innate immune effectors that mediate enhanced bacterial biofilm growth. We performed a high-throughput screen using a collection of over 400 previously identified interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) inserted into a lentiviral vector. We screened the ISG library with biofilm growth assays using airway surface liquid from ISG-expressing CF airway epithelial cells. Biofilms were visualized using epifluorescence microscopy and quantified using an automated volumetric image analysis program. A Z-score was calculated based on biomass for each ISG screened, resulting in six hits. Hexokinase-2 (HK2) is a screen hit, and was upregulated during RSV infection and IFN-beta treatment. HK2 catalyzes the first step of glycolysis and is known for its role in promoting aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect, where cells increase lactic acid fermentation and lactate secretion. We demonstrated that RSV infection and the IFN response cause robust lactate production by the epithelium. Production of lactate is concurrent with induction of aerobic glycolysis genes in the epithelium, as assessed by dual-species RNA sequencing (dual-seq). Induction of the Warburg effect has been reported for other respiratory viruses, including influenza A virus and adenovirus. Our work is the first to demonstrate a role for Warburg metabolism in RSV infection. Lactate is a preferred carbon source to support P. aeruginosa growth, and dual-seq studies reveal P. aeruginosa lactate utilization genes, lldD, lldE, and lldP, were upregulated in the presence of RSV co-infection. Inhibition of host-cell lactate production during IFN-beta treatment diminished P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. To determine if Warburg metabolism is induced in vivo during RSV infection, we used a mouse model of RSV infection and demonstrated an increase of lactate in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Our results reveal that RSV infection and the IFN response promotes aerobic glycolysis and primes the CF airway environment with additional metabolites to foster P. aeruginosa biofilm growth. By advancing our understanding of host immunological-pathogen crosstalk, we may improve the design of targeted treatments to prevent P. aeruginosa biofilm conversion and decrease morbidity in CF.",

These conditions potentiate bacterial colonization associated with the high prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in the CF population. While chronic bacterial infection of the CF airways is thought to be polymicrobial, a dominance of Staphylococcus aureus is associated with CRS in CF patients. S. aureus is also considered a commensal organism in the airways of ~30% of non-CF individuals, leading us to consider differences in the CF sinus microenvironment that may contribute to S. aureus virulence such as nutrient acquisition and microbiota composition. We hypothesized that mucins, the major component of mucus and enriched in the CF airways, could be a nutrient source for S. aureus contributing to its fitness in the sinuses.

However, growth on mucins appears to be more resilient to the depletion of amino acids from CDM, signifying mucin as a potential source of amino acids for S. aureus under respiratory conditions. Growth of S. aureus on mucins under anaerobic conditions typical of the CF sinus microenvironment was not observed. While mucin may not constitute a major nutrient source for S. aureus under nonrespiratory conditions, ordination analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that several anaerobic mucin-degrading members of the Bacteroidetes phylum such as Prevotella and Fusobacterium were enriched in CF samples containing sequences belonging to Staphylococcus. When grown on CDM with mucin in co-culture with an anaerobic mucin-degrading community composed of F. nucleatum, P. melaninogenica, V. parvula, S. gordonii, and S. cristatus, S. aureus LAC exhibited a ten-fold increase in CFUs compared to growth in monoculture.",

Bacterial consortia associated with CF and non-CF patients colonized by Staphylococcus are compositionally distinct, with several mucin-degrading bacteria associated with the sinus microbiome of CF patients. Their presence may be competitive or cooperative for S. aureus utilization of mucins. This ongoing research will better characterize the microenvironment and nutrient availability for S. aureus in chronic bacterial infections of the CF airways. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway is characterized by complex bacterial communities that incite persistent inflammation and airway damage. Based on our rabbit model of sinusitis, blockage of sinus ostia generates a shift in microbiota to a predominance of mucin degrading microbes (MDM) and the shift from acute to chronic sinus inflammation is associated with a robust increase in pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas). MDMs are known to produce mixed acid metabolites (short chain fatty acids (SCFA)), which have the potential to stimulate pathogen growth by offering a carbon source to nonfermenting sinus pathogens (e.g. Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Stenotrophomonas) that cannot utilize sugar. The objective of this study is to evaluate the concentrations of SCFA within the sinonasal mucus and its contribution to the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

GI symptoms, including nutrient malabsorption, growth failure, and GI obstruction, are among the earliest and most severe CF manifestations. Most CF GI microbiome studies have focused on adults, who often receive antibiotics and other confounding therapies. By comparison, children with CF, particularly infants, are likely less impacted by these issues. We hypothesized that infants with CF have GI dysbioses compared with infants without CF that are (1) due to CFTR dysfunction, and are (2) independent of confounders such as diet and antibiotics. As the GI microbiota play important roles in nutrient harvest, vitamin levels, GI health, and growth, all of which relate to long-term health, the CF GI microbiota represents a potential, modifiable target for improving diverse early outcomes.",

Many taxa depleted in the CF microbiota, such as Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium and Bacteroides spp., are known to be important for GI health, nutrient harvest from undigested food, and somatic growth. Conversely, several of the taxa enriched in CF samples, particularly Proteobacteria, are associated with GI inflammation and are potential pathogens. These results provide a critical baseline upon which the relationships between CF GI microbiomes and clinical outcomes, including somatic growth and intestinal function, can be determined. Introduction: S. aureus is the bacterium cultured most often from respiratory secretions of people with CF. S. aureus adapts genetically during chronic CF respiratory infections, including the formation of slowgrowing, antibiotic-resistant variants known as small-colony variants (SCVs). Because S. aureus SCVs do not grow well on standard culture media, they are not routinely identified by most clinical laboratories, precluding registry-based studies of prevalence and clinical associations. In a single-center study using special laboratory methods, we previously showed that S. aureus SCVs commonly infected children with CF and were associated with worse respiratory disease outcomes (Wolter DJ, et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2013; 57:384-91) . Treatment with sulfonamide antibiotics was a risk factor for SCVs. We sought to determine whether these findings are generalizable throughout the US.",

Introduction: Antibiotic therapy is essential for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. Selection is based on previous culture information, if available, or institution specific antibiograms (ABGM). Most institutional ABGM exclude CF patient cultures so it can be a challenge to assess changes in susceptibility patterns or appropriateness of empiric antibiotic selection. The character of CF airway infection and frequent exposure to antimicrobials increases the risk of developing multidrug resistant infections. Antibiotic selection is important in ensuring adequate antimicrobial coverage, while minimizing adverse effects and the development of resistance. The Children's Mercy Kansas City (CMKC) ABGM excluded CF patients, hindering patient care. A CF-specific ABGM (CF-ABGM) was developed in 2016. This abstract reports initial data and future plans.",

RNA-seq of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) treated with T-cell signature cytokines show unique modules of genes that could be used to classify airway inflammation. To test these modules in CF epithelium we obtained samples from CF patients who underwent bronchial brushing of the 2nd or 3rd generation bronchus on the right for RNAseq.

This study suggests that it is feasible to screen monoclonal antibodies for PA-specific IgG from CF patients and generate antibodies for therapeutic use. We have cloned the variable sequences from several anti-PA hits and are in the process of sequencing these to assess the degree of somatic hyper-mutation as well as cloning these for expression in 293 cells for subsequent assays including FACS. Background: Tobramycin exhibits concentration-dependent activity and peak (Cmax) over minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio of 8-10 best predicts efficacy. Toxicity has been shown to relate to trough levels and drug exposure. Once-daily (OD) regimen achieves maximal Cmax with similar efficacy and potentially less toxicity compared to multiple daily dosing (MDD) regimens. A 24-hour area-under-concentration (AUC24) of 75-125 mg*h/L further optimizes efficacy and minimizes toxicity. Post-antibiotic effect (PAE) with tobramycin typically lasts 2-6 hours and limited data suggests prolonging time of undetectable level (t<0.5 mg/L) may induce resistance in P. aeruginosa. Although CF guidelines recommend OD tobramycin for treatment of pulmonary exacerbations, there are no recommendations regarding optimal t<0.5 mg/L. Starting March 2013, a monitoring protocol targeting Cmax 20-40 mg/L and t<0.5 mg/L of 2-6 hours was implemented (Protocol group, PG). Prior to this time, dose adjustment was made from a single random level (pre-Protocol group, pPG). Our objectives are to assess the association between tobramycin exposure (AUC24) and toxicity as well as changes in P. aeruginosa resistance.",

Using a longitudinal collection of MRSA isolates sampled from sputum, blood, or bronchoalveolar lavage of three CF patients at the Yale Adult CF Center, we performed Illumina and Nanopore whole genome sequencing to query genotypic changes incurred by MRSA over time. Phylogeny was analyzed by mapping individual reads from each isolate against a curated ST typematched genome previously obtained from a non-CF source. Phenotypic characterization of the SA isolates included biofilm assays, transepithelial migration assays, analysis of gene transcription, multiplex ELISAs for cytokines, and flow cytometric analysis of cells from a murine infection model. Our findings revealed three distinct MRSA lineages, with few genomic changes observed relative to a panel of P. aeruginosa CF isolates. Among the genomic changes in one patient's sputum and blood isolates were mutations affecting enzymes (GdpP and DacA) involved in the metabolism of the multifunctional secondary messenger cyclic di-AMP. Isolates harboring these mutations exhibited increased biofilm production, modulation of antimicrobial susceptibility, and changes in the expression of genes involved in central carbon metabolism. These MRSA isolates differed minimally in their immunogenicity or in their ability to traverse lung epithelial cell monolayers. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, which acquire major phenotypic differences over the course of infection in CF, our studies indicate that MRSA can acquire predictable mutations in genes implicated in biofilm production and antibiotic resistance and adapt to the CF airways through epigenetic mechanisms.",

The addition of an enteral FQ to INH tobramycin appears to have similar effectiveness to INH tobramycin alone. This aggressive approach for early eradication and prevention of chronic Pa infection in infants with CF should be considered to prevent rapid progression of lung disease and preserve pulmonary function after infection. During chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa transitions from a nonmucoid to a mucoid phenotype characterized by the overproduction of alginate. Additionally, chronic isolates often do not express lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen, a phenotype referred to as LPS-rough. The apparent correlation between alginate expression and loss of O antigen in chronic isolates suggests that alginate and O antigen are inversely regulated. When produced, O antigen is described as long or very long depending on the number of polysaccharide repeat units attached to the LPS molecule. Previous studies reported, and we have confirmed, that PDO300, a mucoid derivative of the nonmucoid laboratory strain PAO1, produces less very long O antigen compared to PAO1, but still expresses long O antigen. We hypothesized that this was due to decreased production of Wzz2, the protein responsible for regulating very long O antigen chain-lengths. To test this hypothesis we analyzed whole cell lysates of PDO300 by immunoblot and showed reduced production of Wzz2 in PDO300 compared to PAO1. This suggests a connection between Wzz2 regulation and alginate production. In order to determine if the down regulation of Wzz2 was clinically relevant we screened a series of nonmucoid and mucoid clinical CF isolates. Overall, the mucoid strains produced less Wzz2 compared to the nonmucoid strains. To further elucidate the relationship between alginate and O antigen production we isolated nonmucoid revertants of a mucoid CF isolate. These revertants had increased Wzz2 compared to the mucoid parent strain. Targeted sequencing of these strains revealed frameshift mutations in algT, the sigma factor that transcribes the alginate operon. Therefore, mutation of algT results in loss of alginate and increased Wzz2 production suggesting an AlgT-dependent pathway for the regulation of Wzz2. These experiments support a model in which a transition between the nonmucoid and mucoid phenotype is accompanied by the down regulation of very long O antigen, through decreased production of Wzz2, prior to the establishment of the LPS-rough chronic phenotype.

Introduction: Selective culture media and molecular diagnostic testing have led to the identification of additional opportunistic pathogens that may contribute to lung disease severity and progression in cystic fibrosis (CF).

Center for Microbial Pathogenesis, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators provide CF patients access to life-prolonging therapeutics, but clinical results vary including persistent bacterial infections. Studies by our group and others demonstrated that host immunity plays an integral role in the inability of CF patients to clear bacterial infections. Defective macrophage autophagy, a host defense mechanism to remove misfolded proteins and intracellular pathogens, is an important example of compromised immunity in CF patients. We have shown that human CF macrophages serve as a replicative niche for bacteria by which they avoid host defenses due to dysfunctional autophagy. In CF, dysfunctional autophagy and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress cooperate to cause heightened inflammation and aggregation of nonfunctional CFTR. Therefore, we sought to determine how three clinically available CFTR modulators that target specific genotypes (ivacaftor, lumacaftor, and tezacaftor) change CF macrophage autophagy and ER stress.",

            "text": "Advances in cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment have improved the quality and survival of patients. However, as CF patients are living longer, nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) infections have increased. NTMs are difficult to treat and contribute to a significant decline in the pulmonary manifestation of CF lung disease. We hypothesize that ineffective CF immunity contributes to deficits in managing NTM infections. Since NTMs are slow growing pathogens, we developed unique culturing conditions and technology to monitor NTM infections in vitro. Our methodology provides the opportunity to monitor Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium avium complex (M. avium + M. intracellular) growth kinetics, survival and metabolic activity. In vitro validation of the NTMs included a focus on macrophages, since they are the primary route of host defense against intracellular bacteria. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were obtained from F508del mice (Cftr -/-) and C57BL/6J controls (Cftr+ /+ ). Cftr -/-BMDMs secreted significantly more IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and KC when compared to Cftr +/+ BMDMs when treated with either free M. avium or M. intracellulare (see Table) . In an effort to investigate the unique and complex CF immune response to NTMs relative to healthy lungs in vivo we have begun to develop murine models of chronic NTM infection. Agarose beads were embedded with either M. avium or M. intracellulare. We verified the ability of the pathogen-embedded agarose beads to develop colony forming units (CFUs) and induce an inflammatory response from the Cftr -/and Cftr +/+ BMDMs. BMDMs from both Cftr -/and Cftr +/+ mice had a greater response to the pathogen-embedded beads than the free pathogen alone or sterile bead controls (see Table) . Further, BMDMs obtained from Cftr -/mice demonstrated a significantly greater response to the bead preparations and free pathogens compared to the Cftr -/controls demonstrating the unique capacity of CF lung macrophages to have an altered response to NTM infections. We next utilized the validated M. avium and M. intracellulare embedded bead sets in our murine model of CF lung infection and inflammation, with results pending. Our unique technology and in vivo modeling system promises to provide a detailed window into the CF inflammatory response to NTM pathogens for therapeutic testing and mechanistic understanding. This work was supported by The Marcus Foundation and The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. LasR is the regulator of a quorum-sensing system by which P. aeruginosa coordinates its expression of virulence factors, and is among the most-mutated genes in CF infections; in addition, lasR mutants are more prevalent in later-stage disease, and lasRcolonized patients display accelerated lung function decline (Feltner JB, et al. MBio. 2016 Oct 4; 7(5) ). Loss of lasR is postulated to provide a growth advantage relative to wild-type P. aeruginosa, however little is known about the role of lasR mutation in host cell interactions. Alveolar macrophages (AM\u03a6) are the principal immune cell in the healthy lung and rest at the interface between the host and respiratory pathogens. They are responsible for pathogen, particulate, and apoptotic cell clearance, in addition to orchestrating the immune response and recruiting other effector cells. Defects in M\u03a6 function have been linked to CF pathogenesis (Barnaby R, et al. AJP Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2018; 314:L432-8) . We therefore explored the interactions of wild-type and lasR -P. aeruginosa with primary alveolar and immortalized human M\u03a6.",

These effects provide insight into both the high prevalence of lasR mutants in later stages of CF (decreased clearance) as well as their association with increased morbidity (increased inflammation). Given that modulation of quorum-sensing systems has become an attractive prospect in the design of novel CF therapeutics, understanding their role in host-pathogen interactions will be critical to their proper pharmacologic targeting. A key question is whether the intensity of anti-Pa therapy is associated with risk of emergence of drug-resistant respiratory pathogens.",

Much less is known about how the \"metagenome,\" the predicted functional capacity of the microbiota, including community antibiotic resistance determinants, changes with antibiotic therapy. The commonly used antibiotic inhaled tobramycin is known to reduce sputum densities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and to improve lung disease measures on average in treatment-na\u00efve patients. However, studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent relationship between changes in sputum Pa densities and lung disease outcomes.

            "text": "Conclusion: Routine RVI screening allowed early influenza and noninfluenza virus detection in 11% and 24% of patients, respectively. RVI screening helped to provide a more definitive diagnosis for patients to better explain the cause of their presenting symptoms. Early RVI detection and management could reduce morbidity/mortality in CF and allow appropriate infection control though the cost-effectiveness of screening remains to be determined. The rise of antibiotic resistance has limited the therapeutic efficacy of conventional antibiotics against CF pathogens. As such, combination therapy and antibiotic cycling have been investigated for pathogen eradication, particularly for Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is a major contributor to the morbidity and mortality of CF patients. Prior work has shown that the concurrent use of antibiotics helps prevent the emergence and spread of resistance. Polymeric nitric oxide (NO) release is an attractive adjunct therapy to antibiotics because it eradicates bacteria through multiple mechanisms, is unlikely to foster resistance, and has previously been reported to act synergistically with silver sulfadiazine (Privett BJ, et al. Mol Pharm. 2010; 7:2289-96) . Nitric oxide-releasing chitosan (COS-EA/NO) both eradicates P. aeruginosa biofilms (Reighard KP, et al. Biofouling. 2015; 31:775-87) and decreases CF sputum viscoelasticity (Reighard KP, et al. ACS Biomater Sci Eng. 2017; 3:1017-26) . The objective of this work was to evaluate how combining NO with antibiotic treatment might improve antibacterial activity. Four different strains of planktonic P. aeruginosa, including three that were multidrug resistant, were exposed to one of six antibiotics (ie, aztreonam, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, and tobramycin) with and in the absence of COS-EA/NO in single agent inhibitory, checkerboard, and combination time-kill assays to fully assess antibiotic-NO interactions. All planktonic assays were performed both aerobically and anaerobically to represent extremes of the oxygen gradient found in CF mucus. Biofilms of all four strains were grown aerobically for 2 days in media and subjected to checkerboard assays with COS-EA/NO and a test agent (ie, tobramycin). Finally, biofilms were pretreated with COS-EA/NO at suberadication concentrations before exposure to tobramycin in order to assess the impact of low-dose NO-releasing scaffolds on biofilm sensitivity to antibiotic treatment. Planktonic P. aeruginosa was serially passaged with subinhibitory doses of COS-EA/NO to determine the likelihood of acquired resistance. Most interactions between COS-EA/NO and the antibiotics were found to be additive or indifferent in the planktonic studies, and no antagonism was observed. Synergy was observed in one P. aeruginosa strain between COS-EA/NO and colistin using checkerboard and time-kill assays, and between COS-EA/NO and tobramycin in time-kill assays. Pretreatment of biofilms with COS-EA/NO at 0.2X MBEC significantly increased biofilm sensitivity to tobramycin (~50-90% reduction in MBEC). Continuous exposure to subinhibitory doses of COS/EA-NO did not lead to an increase in MIC after 60 passages. These preliminary data suggest that COS-EA/NO is a viable adjunct therapy for P. aeruginosa eradication in CF patients because it promotes synergistic interactions and is capable of reducing therapeutic doses of antibiotics for biofilm eradication. Additionally, the likelihood of acquired resistance is low, even after continuous exposure to subinhibitory doses of COS/EA-NO. Experiments are currently underway to evaluate cytotoxicity against a primary cell line of human bronchial epithelial cells. Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have impaired mucociliary clearance and thick mucus, which promote respiratory infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two of the most prevalent respiratory pathogens in CF infections. Both organisms are associated with poor lung function and patient outcomes. In addition, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus form biofilms in the airway, which are highly recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa alters the antibiotic sensitivity profile of S. aureus biofilms. To study polymicrobial interactions, our group has established an in vitro co-culture model on CF-derived bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells. The CFBE cells are homozygous for \u0394F508-CFTR. We used this system along with analogous experiments on plastic dishes to study how interspecies interactions change upon exposure to frontline antibiotics used to treat CF patients. Using this model, we observed that P. aeruginosa supernatant can lead to increased tolerance of S. aureus biofilms to multiple classes of antibiotics, including protein synthesis inhibitors and cell wall-active antibiotics. The small molecule 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) and the siderophores pyoverdine and pyochelin contribute to the ability of P. aeruginosa to protect S. aureus from vancomycin. We propose a model whereby P. aeruginosa forces S. aureus to shift to fermentative growth, leading to a reduced growth rate and decreased susceptibility to cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Additionally, we found that P. aeruginosa supernatant increased the sensitivity of S. aureus biofilms to other classes of compounds, including fluoroquinolones and antiseptics. Treatment of S. aureus with chloroxylenol alone did not decrease biofilm cell viability; however, the combination of chloroxylenol and P. aeruginosa supernatant led to a 4-log reduction in S. aureus biofilm viability compared to exposure to chloroxylenol alone. We found that HQNO, pyoverdine, and pyochelin were responsible for the observed enhanced sensitivity to chloroxylenol. Furthermore, exogenous HQNO can sensitize S. aureus biofilms to chloroxylenol in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, our works shows that interspecies interactions can have dramatic and unexpected impacts on antibiotic efficacy in the context of a polymicrobial disease. (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease associated with significant morbidity and early mortality due to recurrent acute and chronic lung infections (MacKenzie T, et al. Ann Intern Med. 2014; 161:233-41) . The chronic use of multiple antibiotics increases the possibility of multidrug resistance (MDR) and severely limits the options of antibiotic coverage in patients with advanced disease (Sherrard LJ, et al. Lancet. 2014; 384:703-13) . Antibiotic susceptibility determined by culturebased standard techniques may not fully represent antibiotic resistance of all bacteria within the airway. The objective of this study is a) to detect additional antibiotic resistance using molecular methods, and b) to relate the presence of MDR to airway microbiome diversity and pulmonary function.",

University of Colorado, Denver, Denver, CO, USA Introduction: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasingly recognized as a cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). NTM lung disease is defined as compatible symptoms and radiologic findings when NTM are present in respiratory cultures. The decision to start treatment for NTM in CF is confounded by the presence of nonmycobactrial bacterial pathogens. American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines recommend optimal treatment of nonmycobacterial pathogens prior to initiating treatment of NTM to facilitate assessment of clinical response to antimycobacterial treatment. In order to understand best practices for the management of NTM lung disease in the CF patient, it is important to understand what is currently driving treatment decisions and monitoring outcomes. For this study we looked at factors associated with initiation of NTM treatment.",

Evaluation of the CFFPR demonstrates that those who have treatment initiated for NTM infection often have lower rate of PA and MRSA infection, which may be indicative that a lack of nonmycobacterial pathogens influences the decision to treat NTM. Surprisingly, there is not a greater rate of exacerbations that might be predicted to influence treatment. We are not finding clear patient-related factors that drive the decision to treat. Further analysis will investigate if there are center-related factors. Trough based therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of tobramycin is most useful for the prevention of nephrotoxicity. However, trough levels may fail to capture supratherapeutic peaks or area under the curve (AUC) resulting in higher than necessary drug exposure and potential adverse events. AUC based TDM offers a more accurate estimation of drug exposure. In late 2016, our institutional practice changed from single level to AUC based tobramycin TDM in CF.",

Lower tobramycin doses did not appear to be less efficacious in terms of duration of admission and FEV1% recovery.

Lower tobramycin doses did not result in clinically significant changes in renal function. Further study is needed to validate these findings. Introduction: Biofilm-forming pathogens, the major cause of morbidity in CF, are difficult to treat due to additional protection provided by both the biofilm exopolysaccharide matrix and mucus in the airways. Nitric oxide (NO), an endogenously produced free radical involved in the immune response, holds promise as a CF therapeutic due to broad spectrum antibacterial activity (Carpenter AW, et al. Chem Soc Rev. 2012; 41:3742-52) . Inhalation of NO-releasing biopolymers represents an attractive therapeutic strategy as NO release can be sustained for hours, allowing for near continuous NO delivery. Alginate is a particularly promising NO donor scaffold due to its low toxicity, water solubility, and biocompatibility (Draget KI, et al. Food Hydrocoll. 2011; 25:251-6) . Herein, we report the antibiofilm activity of NO-releasing alginates against CF pathogens.",

Introduction: During their course of infection, bacterial pathogens are exposed to a variety of host factors that may influence their infection process and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. While interactions between the host microenvironment and the pathogen are known to play a role in the establishment and persistence of an infection, there is limited knowledge on how the host tissue tunes the efficacy of antimicrobial agents. Gaining insights into the host factors that influence the efficacy of antibiotics may help improve our understanding of why there is such a poor correlation between antibiotic efficacy in vitro and in vivo in the cystic fibrosis patient population.

Like secondary lymphoid organs, TLS harbor segregated B and T cells areas, high endothelial venules, follicular dendritic cells and germinal centers. Persistent bronchopulmonary infection with Staphylococcus aureus (SA), one of the major bacteria infecting CF airways, induces the development of peribronchial TLS in mice in 14 days. Proposed roles of TLS include immune response against infection and autoimmunity. The goals of the present study were to determine the effects of lymphocyte depletion on TLS development (lymphoid neogenesis) and bacterial infection.",

Background: Lung infections with the multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) are difficult to treat in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), due to natural resistance towards most antibiotics. MABSC biofilms were previously observed in CF lung sputum (Qvist T, et al. Eur Respir J. 2015; 46:1823-6) where oxygen (O 2 ) consumption caused by polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity creates anaerobic conditions. However, other CF biofilm pathogens have recently been shown to be tolerant to antibiotic treatment due to dormant subpopulations in the anoxic parts of biofilms. We found strong evidence for aggregation and slow metabolism in MABSC isolates from patients with CF. Stopping this shielding process early may be the best shot at achieving bacterial eradication.",

            "text": "Conclusion: CF lower airway microbiome diversity increases for the first 4 years of life, before seeming to decline in the fifth year. The lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are chronically infected with complex, polymicrobial communities of microorganisms that are recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) are the most prevalent opportunistic pathogens found in the CF lung, and co-infection with both microbes is common. Co-infection is correlated with worse patient outcomes, including increased frequency of clinical exacerbations. Mucoidy, the overproduction by Pa of the secreted exopolysaccharide alginate, is a known marker of chronic infection, with 87% of CF patients infected with mucoid Pa by age 12. Previous work from our lab has shown that mucoid Pa co-exists with Sa through the transcriptional downregulation of genes essential for the production of antimicrobial exoproducts that Pa normally uses to kill Sa, but the mechanism of this downregulation is not known. In the present study we examine the effects of exogenous alginate on Pa transcriptional regulation and interactions with Sa in order to separate the effects of exogenous alginate from the effects of endogenous alginate synthesis and secretion. We supplied exogenous alginate in co-cultures of Pa and Sa to determine whether exogenous alginate alone can facilitate Sa survival, and found that Sa survival increased significantly in the presence of high concentrations (0.025-2%) of exogenous alginate. To determine whether nonmucoid Pa exposed to exogenous alginate downregulates the same set of genes as mucoid Pa, we used a custom Nanostring codeset containing Pa genes known to be downregulated by mucoid conversion to measure Pa transcriptional changes after a short exposure to exogenous alginate. Interestingly, we found that a different set of genes is downregulated in the presence of exogenous alginate, indicating that protection of Sa occurs by distinct mechanisms in the presence of self-produced versus exogenous alginate. In the presence of exogenous alginate, we find that pqsE, which is essential for full Pa virulence towards Sa in co-culture, is downregulated. The finding that exogenous alginate can attenuate virulence of Pa towards Sa led to the hypothesis that mucoid Pa may be able to influence interactions between nonmucoid Pa and Sa. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured mucoid Pa, nonmucoid Pa, and Sa on plastic as a biofilm and discovered that there is a delay in Sa killing by nonmucoid Pa in the presence of mucoid Pa. Therefore, mucoid conversion of Pa strains within the CF lung likely exerts indirect effects on microbial composition through changes in nonmucoid Pa gene regulation in response to exogenous alginate, highlighting the importance of intra-species diversity on inter-species interactions. Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus frequently co-infect the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have previously shown that staphylococcal protein A (SpA) binds to P. aeruginosa leading to bacterial aggregation and tobramycin resistance. Our aim in this study was to determine whether SpA could be detected in the sputum of children with CF and measure the resistance to different classes of antibiotics due to SpA mediated aggregation.",

There is no statistically significant correlation (R 2 = 0.3571) between S. aureus CFU count and the concentration of SpA. Notably, 4 out of the 15 isolates had SpA concentrations ranged from 19.64 -254.64 pg/mL, despite being negative for S. aureus in culture. Additionally, the concentration of SpA in filtrates from clinical isolates of S. aureus was not predictive of the extent of P. aeruginosa biofilm inhibition, as measured by crystal violet (CV) assay. Analysis using confocal microscopy confirmed that the tobramycin resistance of wild-type PA01 was independent of the expression levels of SpA in S. aureus. P. aeruginosa biofilms treated with SpA had increased resistance to 1000 \u00b5g/mL tobramycin, 40 \u00b5g/mL colistin, 200 \u00b5g/mL dornase alfa and 4000 \u00b5g/mL levofloxacin, but remained susceptible to 500 \u00b5g/mL aztreonam.

            "text": "Conclusion: This study provides the first Canadian data on vancomycin and anti-MRSA utilization for the treatment of APE in patients with CF. Vancomycin was the most commonly used antibiotic and appeared to be the first-line agent. However, there was variability in vancomycin dosing strategies, especially within the adult patient population. More research on optimal vancomycin dosing strategies in this patient population is needed. The data suggest educational opportunities for vancomycin dosing in patients with CF. (Pa) is an opportunistic pathogen that chronically infects cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs by forming multicellular biofilms. A major indication of chronic CF lung disease is intermittent acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE), which lead to intravenous antibiotic treatment against Pa infections. Despite the aggressive and intensive antimicrobial interventions against Pa, the reasons for the poor outcome of treatments during chronic stages of lung infection remains unclear. The emergence of the phenotypically diverse populations of Pa in CF lungs has previously been reported but the impact of this on the patient remains unknown. To unravel the effects of population level diversity on both virulence and host response, we first evolved a diverse in vitro PAO1 population in biofilms over 50 days in synthetic sputum medium (SCFM). Our evolution experiment resulted in the emergence of distinct Pa morphotypes which contribute to population-level diversity. Using an ex vivo pig lung model, we observed differential levels of IL-8 production in alveolar tissues infected with different morphotypes. Furthermore, IL-8 levels were negatively correlated (p=0.0348, r= -0.6109) with total protease production of each evolved isolate. We next studied the levels of protease production and tissue damage by Pa isolates collected from CF patients with varying lung functions. We observed differential levels of protease activity by collected isolates and whole mixed diverse populations during planktonic growth in SCFM compared to co-cultures with bronchial epithelial cells (BECs). Using CF-derived BECs in the air-liquid interface (ALI), we assessed changes in induction of pro-inflammatory responses and integrity of the epithelial layer infected with diverse Pa population compared to the single collected isolates. Our work highlights that phenotypic diversity within Pa populations can influence how this organism can impact the pro-inflammatory responses and damage lung tissue; and that Pa population diversity may contribute to pulmonary exacerbation during chronic CF lung infection. Investigating interactions between phenotypically diverse isolates may help inform new strategies for the treatment and control of biofilms and infection. The use of antibiotics has greatly increased the length and quality of life for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, antibiotic resistance is increasing at an alarming rate with the need for alternative therapeutics. Nitric oxide (NO) is an attractive alternative to conventional antibiotics because it has broad spectrum bactericidal activity and acts in a multimechanistic manner, decreasing the risk of undesirable resistance. Our therapeutic, BIOC51, is a NO-donor modified from a natural biopolymer that releases NO spontaneously in solution. We have shown that BIOC51 is bactericidal against > 15 species of bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pre-clinical therapeutic potential of BIOC51 against nontuberculosis Mycobacterium (NTM), which affects ~10% of CF patients and is difficult to treat even with today's best antibiotics.",

Due to the natural and induced resistance of NTM species to many of the commonly used antibiotic treatment regimens, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics to combat these infections. This is especially important, as NTM culture positivity is associated with worse clinical outcomes in CF, including an increase in the rate of decline in pulmonary function (Martiniano SL, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017 ;52(S48):S29-S36). Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is an important reactive oxygen species that functions as an antimicrobial oxidant during the host immune defense. Additionally, H 2 O 2 can be utilized by the host haloperoxidase system to form hypothiocyanite (HOSCN) and hypochlorite (HOCl), two potent oxidants with roles in immune defense (Chandler JD, Day BJ. Free Radic Res. 2015;49(6):695-710). The role of oxidants in host control of NTM is poorly understood.

Adoption of extended fungal cultures in T 2 was also associated with increased use of azoles, with a subsequent decline in positive samples for both Aspergillus and NAFF. CF is a systemic disease characterized by a reduction in lung function and a heightened susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial infections, beginning at a young age and developing into chronic, polymicrobial infections by adulthood. Interestingly, bacterial populations colonizing the lungs of CF patients undergo a series of successional changes as patients age; these changes may be a determinant of pulmonary function and overall health. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a prevalent opportunist infecting younger CF patients. NTHi is a normal commensal of the upper airways, however, in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, such as CF or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), this opportunistic pathogen is able to colonize and persist in the upper and lower airways. There remains a significant gap in our understanding of how early stage infections may influence the complex host-pathogen interactions that are at play in the CF lung. Given that bacterial infection early in life is associated with poorer clinical outcome later in life, we hypothesize that these early infections may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of CF, potentially by facilitating infection with pathogens associated with later stage CF. In this study, we sought to model the earliest stages of CF infection in young children to establish a foundation for additional studies modeling the impact of successional changes on the progression of CF and wellness of patients. Given that NTHi infects primarily younger CF patients, we used both young, recently weaned rats and adult rats to elucidate any differences in NTHi infection based upon age. Additionally, this model progressively develops the mucus obstruction phenotype, recapitulating a critical component of CF pathogenesis, unlike the murine model of CF. Adult and juvenile CFTR -/-and wild-type rats were intratracheally infected with a model strain of NTHi, 86-028NP, after which total lung homogenate was collected for bacterial counts, differential cell count, and a cytokine/chemokine Luminex panel. The data show that CFTR -/-and wild-type rats of both age groups are susceptible to infection by NTHi, as there were significant NTHi populations present in the lungs of infected animals up to 72 hours postinfection. This is in striking contrast to mice (including CFTR -/-mice) which are not permissive to NTHi infection. Additional studies addressing the role(s) for specific NTHi factors involved in persistent infections will be presented. The results of these studies provide encouraging evidence that the rat model of CF can be used to examine infection by several early CF pathogens and potentially provide deeper insights into the nature of the pathogenesis of this disease beginning at early life. The isogenic mutant infection data will be presented at the conference, and this work will add to the growing understanding of early CF infections. The results from this study could provide valuable insight into the nature of the CF lung and the host-pathogen interactions that are most important for establishment of infection by common pathobionts. 3 1.

We performed a retrospective study of children who cultured positive for new BCC airway infections in the six years following guideline implementation.

Acknowledgment: Supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation HONG16B0. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms life-long chronic infections in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), leading to a slow decline in lung function and ultimately death. In the lung environment, P. aeruginosa evolve and often acquire mucA mutations, which are associated with mucoid conversion and poor disease prognosis for CF patients. These clinical mucA mutations lead to the production of truncated proteins that are thought to be fully degraded in the cell. Since MucA inhibits the alternative sigma factor AlgU, these mucA mutations lead to the misregulation of the AlgU regulon. Paradoxically, our work shows that a portion of mucA is required for viability in many strains of P. aeruginosa.",

Our results show that mucA is no longer essential in a strain lacking algU and that mucA alleles that abolish the interaction with AlgU are insufficient for viability. These results suggest that the loss of the MucA-AlgU interaction results in bacterial cell death. Because MucA regulates AlgU, we are currently investigating whether aberrant expression of AlgU-regulated genes in the absence of mucA is the cause of the viability defect. To determine if specific sets of genes in the AlgU regulon are responsible for mucA essentiality, we deleted the genes encoding the three major AlgU-regulated transcription factors AlgR, AlgB, and AmrZ. Our work shows that mucA is still essential in strains lacking one of these three transcription factors. While more work is still needed to understand why this interaction is required for bacterial viability in P. aeruginosa, our results suggest that this interaction may serve as a good therapeutic target. Rationale: Episodic respiratory virus infection including human rhinovirus (RV) likely contributes to early progressive CF lung damage. Given the CF airway has been reported to exhibit defective viral responses, it is critical to assess the innate immune responses unique to CF airways and identify potentially new therapeutic strategies. This study profiled the transcriptome of CF airway epithelial cells (AECs) in response to RV infection.",

Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain Background:Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) are difficult to manage gram-negative opportunistic pathogens of special relevance for CF patients. They are associated with a bad prognosis. BCC treatment is challenging because of their intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics and their remarkable ability for developing acquired resistance. Avibactam is a novel non-\u03b2-lactam \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, with activity against Ambler class A (e.g., extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase [ESBL] and KPC), class C, and some class D enzymes. Recently, the activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against the carbapenemase PenA characteristic of BCC has been documented. Therefore, it could be useful for the treatment of CF patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against BCC strains isolated from chronically infected CF patients and to compare it to other antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of respiratory infections caused by these microorganisms.",

Eradication may be achieved only before chronic infection establishes, making early detection crucial. Initial PsA isolates usually arise during the first years of life by culturing oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples.

Nevertheless, it should be performed along with routine culture, which is still needed to assess the presence of this pathogen in these samples, particularly when the bacterial load is low. Introduction: Bacterial biofilms limit the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics, leading to chronic infections that are difficult to eradicate in patients with CF. NX-AS-401 is a quorum sensing inhibitor that has been found to downregulate genes involved in the formation and maintenance of biofilms (Jakobsen TH, et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2012; 56:2314-25) . Neem Biotech is testing NX-AS-401 for the ability to disrupt biofilms in CF relevant assays, while having limited impact on lung epithelium.",

Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were exposed to NX-AS-401 (1 \u00b5M -1 mM) for 24 h. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured using an EVOM2 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was quantified. Uninfected female C57Bl/6J mice were dosed intratracheally with NX-AS-401(0.01 -50 mg/kg). Mice were assessed at 24 and 48 h for clinical signs, weight loss, inflammation and irritation. Sputum from CF patients was added to tubes containing tobramycin, compound alone, tobramycin and compound, or PBS and incubated in aerobic conditions for 24 h. At 0, 6 and 24 h, 100 \u00b5l aliquots were removed and total microbial load and P. aeruginosa viable count were determined using blood agar and selective plates. C57Bl/6J mice were inoculated intratracheally with P. aeruginosa colonised agar beads. Treatments of compound and/or tobramycin were dosed every 24 h following established infection for 7 days.

Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of 22 closely related species of gram-negative bacteria of clinical importance as an opportunistic pathogen causing chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bcc infections are rarely eradicated and the high-level antibiotic resistance means that combatting these chronic infections is particularly challenging. One species in particular, B. cenocepacia, is associated with poor clinical outcomes and an increased rate of mortality.

            "text": "In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), conventional treatments mostly focused on lessening the manifestations of CF disease (namely bacterial infection and host inflammation) are now supported with new therapeutic approaches to modulate and correct cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). These new therapies have improved outcomes in individuals with CF positively impacting the clinical status but with an uncertain impact on infection, particularly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is the most prevalent bacterium infecting CF patients. Thus, combination therapies can be beneficial and vaccination can represent a rediscovered opportunity in new health conditions. Although several vaccine formulations against P. aeruginosa have reached clinical testing in the past, none of them has become a licensed product and this bacterium remains a challenging vaccine target. To identify new protein antigens against P. aeruginosa, we explored reverse vaccinology approach integrated with additional bioinformatic tools. A set of 52 antigens, classified as known (31) and unknown (21) functions, were selected on the basis of their localization on the cell surface, absence of similarity with E. coli K12 as well as with human and mouse counterparts. Furthermore, conservation of selected antigens was evaluated by comparative genome analysis in a comprehensive panel of P. aeruginosa genomes available in GenBank from different origin and longitudinally isolated from CF patients. To assess the capability of selected antigens, single or in combinations, to provide protection against P. aeruginosa infection, we established a vaccination protocol in the immunocompetent murine model of acute respiratory infection. This systematic screening identified five combinations, capable of significantly increasing the survival rate among challenged mice. Of note, all combinations included PA5340, a protein of unknown function exclusively present in P. aeruginosa. The maximum proportion of protection in challenged mice was obtained with PA5340 combined with PA3526-MotY. Both proteins were confirmed to be surface exposed by immunofluorescence and able to trigger a specific immune response. Thus, combinations of selected candidates, more than single antigens, are effective to control P. aeruginosa infections in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. Overall this study confirms the capability of reverse vaccinology to provide new impulse to the research of vaccines against P. aeruginosa infection through the rapid identification of novel and promising vaccine candidates. Therefore, we propose these new proteins as potential candidates of a new multicomponent vaccine to combat P. aeruginosa infection in CF patients.",

Despite a robust host immune response and aggressive antimicrobial treatment, Pa adapts to these conditions via mutations that promote chronic lung infections. However, less is known about specific pressures in the PN sinuses or lungs that repeatedly select for these mutations across many patients. Our goal was to investigate evolution of Pa during CF CRS, and identify pathoadaptive traits associated with persistence of Pa in the PN sinuses, sinus microbiota changes, or several measures of clinical disease severity. In a 2-year longitudinal study of 33 CF adults, we collected sinus swabs for bacterial culture and microbiome analysis at quarterly clinic visits and during exacerbations. We genotyped 140 Pa isolates from 18 patients and screened for pathoadaptive phenotypes observed in Pa CF lung isolates, including biofilm matrix overproduction, loss of acute virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. Most patients were colonized by one clonal lineage of Pa, but isolates displayed diverse pathoadaptive phenotypes, similar to reports of Pa in the CF lung. Whole genome sequencing of 4 patients' longitudinal isolates revealed that while specific mutations varied across all patients, all lineages acquired nonsynonymous mutations in iron acquisition, amino acid metabolism, interbacterial competition, antibiotic resistance, and global regulatory proteins, suggestive of mutational parallelism between patients similar to observations in the lung. Mutation rates were similar across all 4 patients' Pa lineages, but new mutations in phenotypically environmental Pa lineages did not become fixed in the population. In contrast, mutations in Pa lineages phenotypically resembling chronic CF lung isolates became fixed. To assess fitness following periods of putative pathoadaptation, we evaluated isolates collected early and late in the study for traits we hypothesized are important for persistence in PN sinuses: biofilm formation on CF airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) and competition against other Pa strains. Competition of established Pa with nonclonal, \"invading\" Pa isolates from the same patient Methodology: An Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective review of CF patients treated with vancomycin or linezolid between 01/01/2011 and 09/15/2017 was performed. Patients aged 6 to 21 years with a positive MRSA culture within 12 months of admission who received at least 10 days of treatment in the inpatient setting were included. Patients with a documented hypersensitivity to study medication, those unable to perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and those with a positive Mycobacterium or Burkholderia cepacia culture in the previous 12 months were excluded.

Bacterial biofilms cause chronic infections of wounds, medical implants, and in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. These biofilms often exhibit antibiotic resistance that makes them medically difficult to treat. The ability to monitor target analytes within the structure of the biofilm is critical for understanding biofilm biology and its response to treatment. Oxygen consumption has been used as a measure of metabolic activity in facultative aerobes, but current methods such as microelectrodes limit monitoring to one dimension and cannot adequately capture dynamics. Biofilms are complex three-dimensional (3-D) structures that require higher resolution approaches to gain a more complete understanding of activity. Traditional measurements require physically moving the microelectrode, which is inherently disruptive to biofilm structure and obscures rapid dynamics within the system, which can potentially alter results. Here, we demonstrate optical oxygen-sensitive nanosensors that were used to measure 3-D oxygen gradients with minimal disruption to the biofilm structure in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown from both laboratory strains and CF clinical isolates. We created and characterized optical nanosensors for detection of molecular oxygen which can be incorporated into the biofilm structure during growth. Using these, we obtained confocal microscopy data from which we can determine quantitative 3-D oxygen gradients.",

We also studied 3-D oxygen gradients during antibiotic attack and found that oxygen was present at greater depths compared to untreated controls, consistent with cell death or a transition to anaerobic respiration. This new approach to biological interrogation provides higher resolution data, with improved temporal resolution, while minimizing the impact of the measurement on the biofilm itself.

Persistent polymicrobial infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from CF children and adults, respectively. Notably, P. aeruginosa acquisition correlates with seasonal respiratory virus infections, and CF patients experience severe exacerbations during respiratory viral co-infection. We observed P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on CF airway epithelial cells (AECs) is enhanced during respiratory virus co-infection and hypothesized virus infection also alters microbial community dynamics in the CF airways. Using co-culture systems, we observed that cultured individually with CF AECs, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus each exhibit enhanced biofilm growth on RSV-infected cells. However, when S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are co-cultured, RSV co-infection leads to a dramatic reduction in S. aureus. We observe this trend with laboratory strains and clinical isolates collected from CF patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Additionally, we observed P. aeruginosa exhibits enhanced production of the antimicrobial pyocyanin during RSV co-infection. Exogenous addition of pyocyanin at concentrations observed during P. aeruginosa-virus co-infection decreases S. aureus biofilm populations on CF AECs. When co-cultured with a P. aeruginosa pyocyanin mutant, S. aureus populations did not decrease during virus co-infection. We are currently investigating if this outcome is mediated by specific P. aeruginosa and host interferon-mediated antimicrobial mechanisms activated during respiratory virus infection. We observe RSV infection increases expression of the host interferon stimulated gene, IDO1, resulting in elevated levels of the secondary metabolite kynurenine. IDO1 controls tryptophan metabolism during infection via the kynurenine pathway and has antimicrobial effects towards a range of pathogens, and P. aeruginosa utilizes kynurenine to produce the quorumsensing signal PQS, which regulates pyocyanin production. Dual hostpathogen RNA sequencing to evaluate transcriptomic changes in CF AECs, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus during virus co-infection confirmed that in CF AECs, expression of IDO1 and SLC6A14, encoding the kynurenine transporter hATB 0+ , is increased during co-infection with all three pathogens. The P. aeruginosa genes pqsABCD and phzM responsible for production of the PQS signal and pyocyanin, respectively, also show increased expression, supporting our hypothesis that these pathways mediate host-pathogen crosstalk and antimicrobial activity during polymicrobial infection. This work will further our understanding of how virus co-infection alters interactions between bacterial pathogens and the host and offer insight on the role of viral-bacterial interactions in shaping host-associated polymicrobial communities.",

There was a significant difference in the number of patients that developed AKI in the double coverage group. Our data suggests that this was more common with utilization of aminoglycosides in conjunction with another antibiotic class. This data supports the observation that treatment with single anti-PsA antibiotics may have similar efficacy while reducing the incidence of AKI in this population. Further research is needed to evaluate other longitudinal factors such as rate of lung function decline or development of antimicrobial resistance impacted by single antibiotic treatment of PsA in CF exacerbations. Introduction: Airway infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are common, frequent, persistent, and once chronic, are rarely eradicated. As highly adaptive opportunists, PA in the CF population and individual, present with various phenotypes, virulence factors, and antibiotic tolerances. New or complementary therapeutic strategies are needed which can be effective across the diverse PA population and within the varied CF host environments. Our objective was to compare physiological, phenotypic, and structural characteristics of PA from a variety of sources for uniformity or heterogeneity of features which may impact the results of in vitro investigations of host-pathogen interactions and the potential for adjuvant therapeutic successes.",

In this study, we investigate whether high-dose NO exhibits antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant MAB clinical strains in vitro.",

Therefore the German Society of Pediatric Pneumology published in July 2013 a guideline related to PSA eradication in patients with CF. The guideline is not legally binding.

The initial therapy in 9 (31%) CFC differed from guideline. 7 (24%) of them used a combination of oral ciprofloxacin and inhaled tobramycin, while the guideline proposed either a) the combination of oral ciprofloxacin with inhaled colistin or b) monotherapy with inhaled tobramycin.

It may contribute to the low acceptance rate, that the guideline is a recommendation based on just a few studies. One reason for the low acceptance rate by the smaller CFC could be a lack of frequent personal experience with PSA eradication. The low acceptance of this guideline, which is based mainly on personal experience and not on randomized control trials (RCTs), stresses the need for RCTs in this clinically important area to improve the evidence of recommendations and thereby their acceptance. At the end improving the quality of guidelines will improve the quality of clinical care for CF patients. The M. abscessus complex is composed of three species, M. abscessus, M. bolletii, and M. massiliense, all of which are difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance. Several studies have found that point mutations occur in phoR during chronic infection in CF patients. The genes phoR with phoP compose a putative two-component system whose function in M. abscessus complex is unknown, although homologs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are required for virulence and survival in macrophages. We hypothesized that phoRP is critical for M. abscessus complex infection and that point mutations that occur during infection make the bacteria more fit in the host by modulating pho activity.",

Acknowledgment: Supported by Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital. Patients with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) are often chronically infected by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to significant morbidity. P. aeruginosa virulence is largely regulated through a cell-cell signaling mechanism termed quorum sensing (QS). Typical QS consists of a LuxI-type signal synthase producing a diffusible acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal, which binds a cognate LuxR-type receptor-regulator that activates transcription of target genes. In laboratory strains and conditions, P. aeruginosa employs two AHL synthase/receptor pairs arranged in a hierarchy, with the LasI/R system controlling the RhlI/R system and many downstream virulence factors. Cryptically, P. aeruginosa isolates with inactivating mutations in LasR are frequently isolated from chronic CF infections and are associated with attenuated virulence phenotypes. Our recent work has shown that many of these chronic isolates still employ AHL QS using only the RhlI/R system. Methods: We examined the scope and dynamics of Las-independent Rhl QS in P. aeruginosa using a global transcriptomics approach complemented with phenotypic and biochemical analysis. We assembled a cohort of chronic CF isolates with wild-type lasR, variant lasR, and lasR-null alleles to investigate the regulatory shift from Las to Rhl QS in isolates that span the spectrum of QS genotypes characteristic of CF infection. We transcriptionally profiled each isolate at low-and high-cell density with either added AHL signal or a signal-degrading enzyme to compare QS-ON and QS-OFF states. We introduced fluorescence-based transcriptional gene-fusion reporter plasmids into these isolates to profile the induction kinetics of QS genes dynamically throughout growth.",

Our global analysis of a cohort of chronic CF isolates found radical rewiring of QS. Both timing and magnitude of canonical QS-controlled genes was changed in CF isolates compared to the laboratory wild-type strain PAO1. Furthermore, the hierarchy of Las and Rhl QS appears restructured, with lasR-null isolates still able to activate traditionally Las-regulated genes. Our results implicate Rhl instead of Las as a possible therapeutic target for the disruption of QS-controlled virulence in chronic (not acute) infections. Our work lays a foundation for development of alternative therapeutic strategies directed at P. aeruginosa from chronic CF infections, as well as an improved fundamental understanding of patho-adaptation in QS. Methods: Prospective data on patients undergoing treatment for NTM was collected as a part of each individual's IND with an IRB-approved protocol.

Introduction: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who become infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are treated with antibiotics, but even with active and prolonged therapy not all children eradicate the infection. Failure to eradicate PA infection (hereafter referred to as \"persistence\") leads to chronic PA infection and poor clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that differences in the accessory genomes of PA strains influenced their persistence in CF. We sought to develop a machine learning model based on the presence or absence of specific PA accessory genomic elements (AGEs) to predict which children would develop persistent infections and could therefore be targeted for more aggressive treatments.",

The combination has been found to be synergistic aerobically in 11/16 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, as well as the lab strains PAO1 and PA14 (synergy defined by an FIC \u22640.5). Anaerobically, synergy was tested for PAO1 and PA14 using checkerboard plates with 1% KNO 3 as a terminal electron acceptor. Anaerobically, the Ga(III) MIC for PA01 was 100-200 mM and the MIC for PAO14 was 800-1600 mM. The anaerobic combination MIC for 1.25 mM nitrite was 25 mM for both PAO1 and PA14. In liquid culture, the Ga(III)-nitrite interaction was iron dependent, as increasing the amount of iron in the media blocked the effect. Because bacteria grow in biofilms or aggregates in chronic lung infections, we next tested if Ga(III) and nitrite were synergistic in two biofilm models. Abiotic biofilms were grown on microtitre plates for 24 hours in the presence of Ga(III) and nitrite in a checkerboard design. In the biofilm model, Ga(III) MIC for PAO1 was 313 mM and nitrite MIC was 14 mM. The combination MIC for PAO1 was 3 mM nitrite and 78 mM Ga(III), giving a synergistic FIC of 0.46. Finally, we used a biotic biofilm assay where PAO1 biofilms were grown on the apical surface of human airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o-). Against mature biofilms, nitrite in the assay was bacteriostatic. Ga(III) was bactericidal at concentrations greater than 2.5 mM, with killing to below the limit of detection by 10mM. Addition of nitrite caused additional antibiofilm activity (p<0.01 by one-way ANOVA).",

The mucoid phenotype was mainly present in early and intermediate isolates and did not correlate with resistance; strong biofilm producers were present mostly in the intermediate/late stage of infection, and a significant correlation was found between biofilm production and MDR phenotype. Genomic analyses of the population indicated that the acquisition of antibiotic resistance was evident in specific phylogenetic clusters; however, the emergence of an MDR phenotype over time could not be comprehensively explained by mutations found in known resistance genes or by other pathoadaptive mutations within the genomes, thus supporting the hypothesis that the MDR phenotypes may arise from a combination of yet uncharacterized genomic determinants and/or a differential modulation of the transcriptional profiles. Seven closely related clones with different resistance profiles, were then grown in artificial sputum medium (ASM) and in microaerophilic conditions to mimic the CF environment. For all selected clones, the resistance to antibiotics increased significantly in ASM and biofilm, often resulting in a switch from a susceptible to a resistant phenotype. To characterize the expression profiles of these clones, we performed global gene expression analyses through RNA-seq. Late MDR clones showed a two-fold increased number of differentially expressed genes compared to the growth conditions (planktonic vs. sessile) in respect to the susceptible early one and, when analysed in relation to the isolation time, late clones presented expression profiles more similar to each other than when they were compared to the early one.",

Interestingly, the P. aeruginosa-induced IL-8 response was strongly reduced when co-cultured with R. mucilaginosa. Co-cultures of P. aeruginosa with the other tested bacteria did not show this effect. R. mucilaginosa also exerted anti-inflammatory properties when using other pro-inflammatory stimuli (P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide [LPS], S. aureus, or H 2 O 2 ) or various P. aeruginosa CF isolates. The anti-inflammatory effect of R. mucilaginosa was also observed using CF cell lines (CFBE, IB3). In addition, this bacterium was able to significantly reduce the P. aeruginosa-induced MCP-1, IL-6 and GM-CSF response in 3-D lung epithelial cells. With regard to the mode of action, qPCR array results have shown a potential effect of R. mucilaginosa on the NF-\u03baB-pathway. An inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB-pathway activation was confirmed using Western blotting and a 3-D model of a NF-\u03baB-reporter lung epithelial cell line. Based on these results, we conclude that R. mucilaginosa is able to significantly reduce the inflammatory response in 3-D lung epithelial cells via inhibition of the NF-\u03baB-pathway. These data suggest the presence of potentially beneficial bacteria in the CF lung microbiome, which could be exploited as a novel way to treat the excessive inflammation in CF patients.

Noninvasive airway sampling in preschool children can be inaccurate and methods such as cough swabs are ineffective to detect organisms such as tuberculosis mycobacterium.

Introduction: Extended-interval dosing of tobramycin in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients has been established as equally efficacious and potentially less nephrotoxic than the traditional dosing strategy. The optimal dosing strategy has not been well-defined and it is not known if one can predict, with sufficient precision, future dosing without repeating levels. The optimal pharmacodynamic parameter that predicts aminoglycoside efficacy has traditionally been correlated to peak concentrations. Recently there has been evidence supporting the use of 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-24 ) as a pharmacodynamic marker of both efficacy and safety. We present here a large single-center experience of dosing tobramycin based on 2-and 8-hour levels with subsequent extrapolation of peak (C max ) and trough (C min ) concentrations as compared to the AUC 0-24 , and a determination of within-patient variability with these strategies.",

However, larger, controlled studies are needed to understand the pharmacodynamic correlation of AUC 0-24 , consistency between dosing and clinical outcomes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an important colonizer in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is positively correlated with poor lung function, CF-related diabetes, shorter time to pulmonary exacerbation, and shorter time to transplant or death. We were interested in understanding the transcriptional response of Stenotrophomonas to CF sputum and identifying genes required to grow on its components. For the transcriptional response, we used RNA-Seq to analyze the transcriptomes of S. maltophilia K279a and two CF clinical S. maltophilia isolates in response to the artificial CF sputum formulation SCFM2. To identify genes required to metabolize sputum components, we have focused on mucin utilization. There were a large number of conserved transcriptional responses to SCFM2 in the three Stenotrophomonas strains, including those predicted to be implicated in low-oxygen growth, virulence, and metabolism. Also interesting were transcripts whose expression changes were CF-isolate specific, including those involved in cell motility, surface-adhered biofilms, and stress responses. These CF-specific changes correlate with in vitro phenotypes observed by us and others, including loss of swimming motility, decreased attached biofilms, and greatly increased oxidative resistance among CF isolates. For mucin degradation, we have initially screened 6000 transposon mutants for inability to use mucin as a sole carbon source. Three mutants have been identified in carbohydrate metabolism genes that suggest potentially important utilization pathways for the carbohydrate component of mucin.",

Introduction: Studies of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung microbiome have shown that as patients age microbial diversity decreases due to the dominance of bacterial pathogens, but the drivers of this microbial succession are poorly understood.

Our data also show that LasR LOF strains can outcompete their isogenic LasR+ counterparts in a microoxic competition assay. Anr controls the expression of a high affinity cytochrome oxidase (cco2) that is important for microoxic respiration (Comolli JC, Donohue TJ. Mol Microbiol. 2004; 51:1193-203) . The expression of cco2 is correlated with expression of PA1673 across over 1000 samples, and both genes are highly expressed in LasR LOF strains. We have shown that PA1673 is also critical for microoxic fitness. Biochemical characterization confirmed that PA1673 is a hemerythrin, a class of di-iron proteins, that can bind oxygen reversibly with a K d of 1 \u00b5M. Genetic analyses suggest a model in which PA1673 works in conjunction with the high affinity cytochrome oxidases to help cells manage intracellular oxygen. Our data indicate that PA1673 sequesters oxygen away from enzymes involved in the catabolism of carbon sources that require oxygen as a co-substrate. PA1673 significantly inhibits the catabolism of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and choline, which are substrates previously shown to impact signaling and virulence factor regulation.",

Introduction: CF respiratory disease is a major determinant of reduced quality and length of life and is characterized by chronic, recalcitrant infections. Historically, these infections have been analyzed by classic clinical culture and, more recently, 16S amplicon sequencing. This newer molecular method has demonstrated the CF sputum microbiota to be polymicrobial, often comprising taxa not detected using traditional culture methods. These more recent studies have thus far failed, however, to find consistent predictors of either therapeutic success or clinical status. Metagenomic sequencing of total CF sputum DNA has the potential to characterize both the taxonomic and functional components of sputum microbiota, potentially providing further insight into the persistence of CF respiratory infections. Metagenomic sequencing of CF sputum is hampered, however, by overwhelming quantities of host DNA, leaving a small proportion of microbial reads available for metagenomic analysis. Furthermore, a sizable portion of bacterial DNA in sputum originates from dead bacterial cells, masking the true viable microbial contribution. In this study, we compared the abilities of four methods to deplete human DNA from CF sputum samples. Our goal is to develop a method for metagenomic sequencing of CF sputum that enables functional characterization of these complex microbial communities.",

These variants have an increased propensity for biofilm formation, which may facilitate bacterial resistance to clearance. The significance of S. pneumoniae as a pathogen in patients with CF merits additional work; while these infections may be problematic, there are also indications that pneumococci can compete with other bacteria and potentially impede colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Introduction: S. aureus (Sa) is the bacterium most frequently cultured from CF respiratory samples, and Sa infection has been associated with lung disease severity. Thus, the identification of Sa can impact treatment decisions and patient outcomes. Typically, the first step of Sa detection in clinical samples is growth on mannitol salt agar (MSA), a selective medium for cultivating and identifying staphylococci. Fermentation of mannitol (MAN) by Sa creates lactic acid, changing the color of a pH indicator in MSA which allows for easy discrimination between Staphylococcus species. MAN fermentation is believed to be conserved in Sa. Therefore, this test is often used by laboratories as a screen to identify this species. However, the existence of nonfermenting (MAN-neg) Sa has been described in non-CF infections. The role of MAN-neg Sa in CF has not been investigated. We sought to determine if MAN-neg Sa isolates, 1) are prevalent in CF respiratory samples, 2) can predominate individual sputum samples, and 3) have lost the ability to ferment MAN through common mechanisms.",

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, multi-organ disease caused by absent or dysfunctional CFTR mediated anion secretion, which in the lung, leads to mucus obstruction, chronic infection/inflammation, and increased acidity in the airway surface liquid (ASL). Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) bacteria are extremely pathogenic to CF patients, and acquisition of Bcc is associated with a significant increase in mortality.

Introduction: Azithromycin (AZM) is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Studies have shown that AZM use in CF reduces pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), lung function decline and improves nutritional status. This benefit is particularly observed in those chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa-an organism with intrinsic AZM resistance. Alternate mechanisms including host immune modulation, antivirulence and antiviral effects have been proposed to explain AZM benefits. However, the CF airways are infected with a diverse community of organisms and it may be through AZM effects on the CF microbiome that AZM provides benefit.

Modification of microbial community structure may not be a mechanism by which AZM exerts its clinical benefits. Cystic fibrosis patients experience disproportionately high rates of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) because of epithelial CFTR dysfunction, with upwards of 95% of individuals displaying radiography characteristic of the disease. CRS is associated with microbial colonization of the sinonasal mucosa, and it has recently been appreciated that metastasis of dominant organisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in patients with this disorder may significantly contribute to development of chronic lower airway infection. Chronic colonization with P. aeruginosa in CF patients correlates with trends in seasonal respiratory virus infection (respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A, rhinovirus (RV)) (5,6). We have recently demonstrated that respiratory virus infection (RSV, RV) promotes increased P. aeruginosa biofilm growth through bronchial epithelial dysregulation of iron sequestration. In addition, we observed an increase in both iron and P. aeruginosa biofilm growth on rhinovirus-infected primary CF sinonasal epithelial cells. To test the hypothesis that sinus virus infection and iron levels affect the microbiota present in the CF paranasal sinuses, we utilized longitudinal 16s rRNA sequencing, 52-plex cytokine panels, and iron quantification in a prospective cohort of 33 CF CRS patients undergoing routine nasal endoscopy with evaluation and debridement. Sinus samples were also subjected to q-RT-PCR respiratory virus panels, where virus infections were detected in 18% of patient visits and the most common viruses detected were human rhinovirus and coronavirus. Using a longitudinal mixed effects model, viral infection was associated with increased sinus iron concentrations. Patients presented with low microbial diversity (alpha diversity), with Staphylococcus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. representing the most abundant taxa and virus detection was associated with a further reduction in microbial diversity measures. In a univariate analysis, pseudomonads and Stenotrophomonas were significantly enriched, whereas streptococci were significantly reduced on virus-positive visits. Together, these data suggest a dynamic, exploitative interplay between the host epithelium and its microbial constituents modulated by nutritional immunity during virus coinfections.",

Introduction: Antibiotic efficacy achieved in vitro infrequently correlates with clinical outcomes. For example, if a P. aeruginosa isolate demonstrates susceptibility to a given antibiotic in the clinical lab, that compound can be ineffective when administered in vivo. Conversely, if a pathogen is found to be resistant to an antimicrobial in vitro, treatment with that same compound can result in the resolution of patient symptoms.

Introduction:Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pathogen with an increasing prevalence, high virulence, and antibiotic resistance that is implicated in lung function decline. M. abscessus growth studies are largely confined in vitro to the use of simple bacterial broth as the growth media, or to complex in vivo systems. However, bacterial growth is highly dependent on growth conditions. The CF airway is enriched in neutrophils and neutrophil corpses. Dead and dying neutrophils modify the growth of CF pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in ways that can undermine therapy, such as increased antibiotic susceptibility by biofilm-like aggregate formation. We sought to understand if M. abscessus growth is modified in the presence of dead and dying neutrophils. Recognizing the mode of growth and antibiotic response of M. abscessus in CF airway conditions may provide insight into development and testing of novel antimicrobials.",

Introduction: Antibiotic (ABX) selection for CF pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) management is frequently guided by respiratory cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) to identify pathogen-specific resistance patterns. Although evidence-based AST guidelines exist for acute systemic infections, its clinical utility in CF PEx management is unclear. Small, single-center analyses in CF have failed to illustrate any AST clinical benefit. This study aimed to describe the frequency of AST in pediatric PEx, to determine if AST ordered at PEx diagnosis is associated with an alteration to initially-prescribed ABX regimens, and to test relationships with time to next PEx requiring ABX.",

Associations between AST and ABX switching were modelled by multivariate logistic regression models and fixed-effects to adjust for hospital-level variation.

Additional modeling (including survival analyses for time to next PEx) will test for correlation of AST and clinical outcomes. Rationale and Objective: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) pulmonary infections are the primary cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Today, there is no way to predict early Pa colonization. We hypothesized that the airways microbiota may provide clues to decipher this issue. In a microbiome-based pilot study, we found that Porphyromonas was negatively correlated with Pa. In a previous study (Bernarde C, et al., PLoS One. 2015; (4)), we demonstrated a sustainable increase of Porphyromonas after initiation of ivacaftor, which was positively correlated with the FEV1. Taken together these results suggest that Porphyromonas could be a favorable prognostic biomarker in CF, especially in the context of Pa pulmonary infection. To go further, we tested this hypothesis in a larger cohort study.",

Other outcomes included overall changes in PA susceptibility to aztreonam, i.e., the proportion of subjects whose highest MIC was susceptible (\u22648 \u00b5g/mL) vs resistant (>8 \u00b5g/mL), susceptibility to other anti-PA antibiotics over time, and the association between AZLI exposure (\u22651 course in the 12 months prior to respiratory cultures) and changes in these susceptibility patterns.

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, genetic lung disease that is characterized by persistent infections and mucus buildup that results in worsening lung function. Due to the risk for MRSA, vancomycin is a common treatment in patients with CF. A common, but difficult to predict reaction that can occur with vancomycin treatment is known as red man syndrome (RMS). The primary objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of RMS in pediatric CF patients versus non-CF patients. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the use of pre-treatment diphenhydramine and risk factors for RMS, specifically examining vancomycin infusion rate (mg/kg/minute), vancomycin infusion duration (1-h vs. greater than 2-h), and vancomycin dose (mg/kg).",

Of those patients that experienced RMS 73% in the CF group and 27% in the non-CF group received pre-treatment diphenhydramine (P < 0.001).

We have previously demonstrated that oral-derived anaerobic bacteria are abundant in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples derived from asymptomatic CF infants. Without the cross feeding of metabolites liberated by mucin-degrading oral anaerobes, the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on a mucin nutrient source is limited.

While established Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in people with CF are generally thought to be clonal, meaning that only one strain infects at a time, there are situations in which multiple P. aeruginosa strains co-exist in CF lungs. For example, multiple P. aeruginosa strains can sometimes be detected early in infection, before a single strain dominates. In addition, epidemic strains can displace established P. aeruginosa, likely after some period of co-existence. It is also possible that CF lungs commonly harbor nondominant P. aeruginosa strains at a low abundance, or multiple strains of other pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus. A key roadblock to understanding is that identification methods typically examine small numbers of isolates from sputum, so co-existing strains could easily be missed. Improved methods could enable early detection of superinfection by epidemic lineages, and improve understanding of strain competition during the initiation and chronic phases of infection. We have developed two methods that combine Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and next-generation sequencing to detect co-existing P. aeruginosa or S. aureus strains that have different sequence types in CF sputum. In the first method, sputum is spread onto selective agar to allow for growth of the targeted bacterial species. After incubation, hundreds of colonies are scraped from the plate and the DNA from the population is isolated and pooled. The seven standard MLST loci used for strain typing (Curran B, et al. J Clin Microbiol. 2004; 42:2:5644-9; Enright M, et al. J Clin Microbiol. 2000; 38:3:1008-15 ) are amplified and sequenced using Illumina. Population-level allelic variation at all seven loci is then analyzed to determine if multiple sequence types are present. If strain-level complexity is manageable, the relative proportion of the sequence types can be measured. Control experiments show that strains can be identified if present at approximately 1% relative abundance. A second version of the method amplifies MLST loci from DNA extracted directly from sputum. This approach could be particularly useful for identifying strains that are present in lungs, but exhibit growth defects in culture, or to measure strain relative abundance in vivo without artifacts induced by growth differences. Additional information on the methods, and proof of principle analysis of CF sputum samples will be presented. These tractable methods to simultaneously interrogate hundreds of isolates in individual CF sputum samples could lead to new insights into strain dynamics during CF infection pathogenesis. Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogens that are clinically challenging to diagnose and eradicate with treatment. The current method for pathogen detection is sputum culture that has significant limitations including slow growth and low sensitivity due to necessary decontamination procedures. Culture-independent detection of NTM with 16S rRNA sequencing has shown poor sensitivity and correlation to culture. Therefore, we have designed primers in the rpoB gene to specifically amplify the NTM \"microbiome\" that includes a range of NTM species and subspecies. We hypothesize that an NTM-specific molecular assay will have advantages over sputum culture for detecting bacterial burden and predicting clinical significance of NTM in the CF airway.",

It also offers the potential to discriminate clinical phenotypes. The frequent and unexpected observation of mixed species infections suggests a complex NTM ecology not previously described in CF airways and not detected by standard culture techniques. One of the most widespread and destructive opportunistic pathogens in the cystic fibrosis airways is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, P. aeruginosa does not colonize the airways alone. Microbes that are common in the oral cavity such as Rothia mucilaginosa are also present in cystic fibrosis sputum, and have different metabolic capacities than P. aeruginosa. We examined the metabolic interactions between P. aeruginosa and R. mucilaginosa using stable isotope assisted metabolomics. Glucose-derived 13 C was incorporated into glycolysis metabolites, lactate and acetate, and some amino acids by R. mucilaginosa. P. aeruginosa utilized labeled substrates derived from R. mucilaginosa to generate different primary metabolites in hypoxic versus aerobic conditions. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH was used to track changes in cellular metabolism and indicated a shift in bacterial central metabolism in different oxygen levels and during cross-feeding interactions. These results indicate P. aeruginosa may get a metabolic boost from its microbial neighbor, which could contribute to its colonization of the cystic fibrosis airways. This work was supported as a pilot project from the UC Davis West Coast Metabolomics Center funded by NIH DK097154, and T.G. is supported through the BEST IGERT program funded by the National Science Foundation DGE-1144901. The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients die as a result of respiratory failure caused by chronic bacterial colonization and inflammation in the airways. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common gram-negative CF pathogen, other gram-negative microbes, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, are becoming increasingly dominant in the CF airways. Specifically, S. maltophilia is estimated to infect as many as 30% of CF patients and is associated with a three-fold increase risk of mortality or lung transplant in CF patients. In order to investigate S. maltophilia's adaptation to CF lungs we (1) sought to identify a CF-specific accessory genome amongst a collection of S. maltophilia strains, (2) identified which genes are expressed by S. maltophilia in the lung, and (3) characterized growth, gene expression, and metabolite production for S. maltophilia growing in vitro at a range of pH. Our multiscale 'omics approach indicates that acidic conditions are stressful for S. maltophilia and this bacterium copes through increased expression of DNA repair genes. Taken together, our findings suggest that S. maltophilia may not have evolved to be a CF lung pathogen, and that its negative effects on the human host may be a byproduct of its attempt to cope with the unfavorable environment of the CF lungs. Introduction:Haemophilus influenzae (HI) is one of the most frequently identified organisms in the lungs of CF patients. Indeed, it is commonly referred to as an early airways colonizer. Whereas HI has been extensively studied in pediatric populations, little is known about it in adults with CF.",

As median projected survival in CF increases, a growing challenge is the strategic management of infections. Colistin, a polymyxin antibiotic, is a powerful treatment option in CF acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE) secondary to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, little is known about how it is metabolized and how to best optimize dosing for therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity. FDA dosing recommendations are not based on modeling studies, which increases the risk of treatment failures and toxicity. Newer, highly accurate analytical techniques are available in research settings which allow accurate pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies of the drug, to better understand its metabolism in CF.

Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations chronically infecting the CF lung exhibit profound population heterogeneity. To improve quality of life, lung function, and reduce exacerbation occurrence, patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection are prescribed inhaled antibiotics such as aztreonam (AZLI). These typically reduce sputum P. aeruginosa burden by 1-2 log. However, clinical improvements do not correlate with Pseudomonas killing. We postulated that inhaled antibiotics disproportionally kill virulent P. aeruginosa, and as such populations collected under AZLI selective pressure would have lower pathogenicity.",

To determine if AZLI induced changes in P. aeruginosa population pathogenicity, sputum samples were collected from CF patients at two time points: day 0 (prior to AZLI) and after 28 days of AZLI 75 mg inhaled TID. From each sputum sample, approximately 80 randomly selected individual isolates were independently collected and stored, and subsequently pooled together to create an artificial community.

Particularly induced in the presence of RSV were phenazines, and associated pathways, as well as elastase and iron acquisition genes.

University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA Introduction: Due to recent advancements in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF), the number of patients entering adulthood continues to increase and in many countries the percentage of adult patients exceeds that of pediatric patients. Parallel to this shift, the number of pregnancies occurring in women with cystic fibrosis has risen steadily, with 235 pregnancies reported in 2015 versus 124 pregnancies in 1990 (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Patient Registry Annual Data Report. 2015). As pregnancy becomes more common in cystic fibrosis, many questions have arisen around the impact of pregnancy and childbirth on clinical outcomes and disease management. One area that remains uncertain is the impact on patient specific pharmacokinetic parameters. Both CF patients and pregnant patients experience changes in medication metabolism, distribution, and excretion. However, the effect of pregnancy on medication clearance in cystic fibrosis patients is unknown.",

When compared to clearance rates prior to pregnancy, patient #1 experienced a 22% decrease in clearance (310mL/min to 243mL/min) while patient #2 experienced a 47% decrease (355mL/min to 189mL/min). Both patients maintained a reduced initial clearance rate during the post-pregnancy APE and only one dose adjustment occurred. Patients #3 and #4 did not display a change in clearance rates during pregnancy. Day 7 clearance rates were similar across available hospitalizations for 3 patients and 1 patient did not have day 7 levels available during pregnancy.",

Biology and Biological Engineering, Caltech, Pasadena, CA, USA Mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolve during chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) infections and make robust biofilms that protect against antibiotics and the immune response. Previous measurements suggested that alginate gene expression is induced in response to low oxygen, however, these measurements were made in bulk liquid cultures. Because P. aeruginosa is thought to grow as biofilms in vivo and biofilms are known to exhibit large oxygen gradients, we wondered whether alginate production within biofilms might be localized to particular regions. We used confocal microscopy to determine where alginate transcripts are expressed within biofilm populations grown using the agar block biofilm assay (ABBA), which permits rapid study of biofilms; the ABBA assay establishes oxygen gradients over the entire aggregate population and within individual aggregates. The hybridization chain reaction (HCR) was used to detect alginate mRNA transcripts within aggregate biofilms. Using an inducible alginate gene expression system, we showed that HCR microscopic analysis is quantitative. Measuring alginate gene expression using ABBA, we found that alginate gene expression is not detected in single cells nor in small aggregates that begin to form after 8 hours of growth. However, after approximately 12 hours, alginate gene expression was observed in intermediate-sized aggregates growing approximately 100-400 \u00b5m below the agar surface where oxygen would be expected to begin to be limiting. Surprisingly, in the mature fully-formed 18-hour aggregates, biofilm-grown mucoid P. aeruginosa only expressed alginate genes growing near the agar surface, where oxygen concentrations are highest. Moreover, within these mature aggregates, alginate gene expression was highest in cells growing near the aggregate surface. Together, these patterns of alginate gene expression suggest that biofilm P. aeruginosa express alginate genes in microaerobic zones rather than in purely anaerobic conditions, as had been suggested by previous studies in liquid cultures. This could be especially important in CF lung mucus where oxygen gradients are steep and suggests that alginate may be most protective for bacteria growing near the air-mucus interface. Going forward, we will be examining where alginate genes are expressed in vivo in model infection systems and in CF patient specimens. 1 1. Indiana Univ., Indianapolis, IN, USA; 2.

There were no statistically significant associations with PRAGMA-CF results and rate of symptom reporting (for any of the symptoms), number of hospitalizations, or courses of antibiotics. Adjusting for age, study site, and the rate of other symptoms, the reporting rate of ABS was associated with AWT (p=0.04) (N=62). The median (range) rate of ABS was 3.0 (0-51.4)%. Amongst 56 infants with adequate NP testing, influenza was detected at least once in 5%, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 5%, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 14%, parainfluenza in 25%, coronavirus in 25%, and human rhinovirus in 82%. In multivariate models adjusting for age, site, and other viruses, infants ever positive for RSV had higher Total Disease (p=0.02) (N=54); while any HMPV infection was associated with increased AT (p=0.01) (N=48).",

Background: Inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) has been shown to be an effective mucociliary clearance agent in persons with CF >6 years of age. The ISIS (Infant Study of Inhaled Saline) study, a randomized controlled trial of HS in infants and young children, demonstrated no effect of HS on pulmonary exacerbations, the primary endpoint, but did demonstrate a significant effect on infant lung function in a substudy and on the lung clearance index (LCI, a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity) in a singlecenter ancillary study. We aimed to assess the treatment effect of HS on the LCI in preschool children with CF in a large, multicenter clinical trial. Our primary hypothesis is that, compared to isotonic saline (IS), HS will improve the LCI during the 48-week treatment period.",

As secondary analyses, we are also evaluating longitudinal associations of LCI with spirometric indices and clinical endpoints. Participants have a confirmed diagnosis of CF, ages \u226536 to \u226472 months at screening, have not used HS in the prior month and were able to provide acceptable LCI results at screening and enrollment. IRB approval was obtained at each site as well as parental/guardian informed consent. Participants were pre-treated with albuterol and randomized to inhale 7% HS or 0.9% IS twice daily for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change in LCI via nitrogen multiple breath washout from enrollment to Week 48. Secondary endpoints include FEV 0.75 measured by preschool spirometry, protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations, modified CFQ-R, the CF Respiratory Sign Diary (an observer-reported outcome) and rates of treatment-emergent CF respiratory pathogens. All sites were trained and certified in multiple breath washout and preschool spirometry, and all tests are over-read for acceptability.",

STOP2 (Standardized Treatment Of PEx 2) is an ongoing multicenter, randomized, controlled open-label trial that evaluates early response to PEx IV antibiotic treatment, where early robust responders (ERR) are eligible for a shorter treatment duration, and non-ERR (NERR) are candidates for a longer IV antibiotic course.

Further analysis and research is required to determine the clinical significance of the differences in insurance status and symptom duration we observed in the phone ABx group. Methods: In this IRB-approved prospective study, 6 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (mean 11.8\u00b13.8 years) admitted for an APE were recruited. Two patients were recruited from each FEV1 (percent predicted) category (mild \u2265 70, moderate 50 -70, severe \u2264 50). Signed informed assents/ consents were obtained. Subjects completed a chest MRI, using UTE and T1 mapping (modified look-locker inversion recovery), spirometry and CFRSD-CRISS questionnaire within 24 hours of admission (time 0), at 1 week (time 1) and at 2 weeks (time 2). Two cases did not complete last MRI (time 2 MRI). MRI scoring (Eichinger, et al. Eur J Radiol. 2012; 81(6) :1321-9) was performed by two experienced pediatric radiologists blinded to the patients' names and dates of studies. T1 mapping was used as a surrogate for perfusion images for functional scoring. A region of interest analysis on T1 mapping images was used to calculate the mean normalized T1 (nT1) values for all lobes. The percent lung volume without T1 value (T1 null) on the system generated analysis map was calculated. The primary outcome was to assess the differences in mean nT1, percent volume of T1 null, and MRI scores during treatment. Correlation between the mean nT1, T1 null volume and MRI scoring with spirometry and CFRSD-CRISS questionnaire was evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed by t-test, linear mixed effects model, Pearson, Spearman's and Kendall's correlation tests. P<0.05 was considered significant.",

Additional risk factors such as surgery, immobility, and frequent placement of peripherally inserted central catheters also exist in this population. Current treatment guidelines for VTE recommend long-term anticoagulant therapy with a direct oral anticoagulant over the vitamin K antagonist warfarin. Patients with CF diagnosed with VTE pose unique therapeutic challenges stemming from malabsorption of vitamin K, and often have underlying liver dysfunction to further complicate blood coagulation and metabolism of anticoagulants. In addition, many medications prescribed to patients with CF have pharmacokinetic properties that alter the metabolism of anticoagulant drugs. Despite these challenges, there are currently no recommendations for VTE management specific to patients with CF.",

Frequently identified VTE treatment challenges for centers were navigating drug-drug interactions and managing therapeutic complications. For common VTE scenarios, centers responded that pediatric CF patients are most often treated with LMWH and warfarin, while adult CF patients are treated with a variety of anticoagulants including LMWH/UFH and warfarin, apixaban, and rivaroxaban.

Clinically significant improvement in lung function, weight gain and reduction in number of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) have been demonstrated for the first 6 to 12 months of the treatment, but benefits from continuation of the therapy beyond 12 months were not evident. Keeping P. aeruginosa infected patients on a long-term azithromycin maintenance therapy is still a common practice, despite lack of information about its optimal duration or positive impact on patients' health status in the long run. To evaluate usefulness of a prolonged azithromycin treatment, we analyzed data from 25 CF patients who stopped their therapy with azithromycin after two or more years of administration.",

Using mixed effects models, CFRD was associated with a 3.8 point increase in SNOT22 scores per year (fitted model shown in Fig) . Nasal steroid use was not associated with different baseline SNOT22, but it was associated with 3.2 point decrease in severity per year.

Despite these advantages, the risk of life-threatening arrhythmia due to QTc prolongation may limit its use. This is well-documented with treatment doses of azithromycin, but studies regarding EKG monitoring with the use of prophylactic azithromycin are lacking. Additionally, with increased focus on mental health screening in the CF population, more patients may be connected to care for their depression and anxiety, potentially leading to initiation of antidepressants or anxiolytics associated with QTc prolongation.",

This is inconsistent with previous studies that reported no concerning EKG changes in CF patients on concomitant prophylactic azithromycin and antidepressants (Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50(S41):352; Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017; 52(S47) :327). However, other authors have found borderline elevated QTc intervals in adolescent males on prophylactic azithromycin only (J Cyst Fibros. 2016; 15:192-5) . The variation in findings reinforces the need for larger, multicenter studies to define the true incidence of QTc prolongation and clear guidelines on appropriate monitoring for this patient population. The CF Foundation (CFF) guidelines for respiratory care includes recommendations regarding the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The 2013 recommendations are derived from results of numerous randomized controlled trials looking at ICS use in CF patients. These recommendations were reported as a \"D,\" meaning the magnitude of net benefit was zero or negative in regards to giving ICS to patients without asthma or ABPA in ages greater than 6 to improve lung function, quality of life or reduce pulmonary exacerbations (Mogayzal M, et al. Amer J Respir Crit Care Med. 2013; 187:680-9) . Because of the lack of benefit and potential concern for harm with the use of ICS, namely due to risk of longitudinal growth impairment, the CFF follows ICS use in each of the certified CF centers and presents this data in their yearly report. In an effort to work towards lowering our center's use of ICS in CF patients, we looked closely at ICS use over time, differences by age group, ICS type and prescribing habits of different CF providers.",

Their individual patient populations vary from 4 to 65 total patients with a percentage of ICS use in these patients (without asthma/ABPA) ranging from 0 to 50%. Patients with documented asthma or ABPA were slightly more likely to be on an ICS/LABA combination inhaler (38%) instead of ICS alone when compared to patients who had documented justification for use of ICS that was not asthma or ABPA (27%). Those with a documented justification (not asthma or ABPA) were most likely to be on high dose ICS/ LABA (27%) vs other groups. Of those patients without documented justification for ICS use, 77% were on ICS alone (without a LABA).",

We found there is variability amongst providers as to how they utilize these medications and their documentation regarding that. We can continue to improve our use of these medications while understanding the individual practice style of our physician cohort is not homogeneous. Background: CF is a disease with equal prevalence across sexes, but prior studies have shown that women have worse outcomes, such as increased mortality. It is well known that pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) in CF patients can lead to decreased lung function, lower quality of life and shortened survival, but there is a paucity of data evaluating the existence of sex differences in frequency, treatment, and outcomes in PEx. The objective of our study was to evaluate sex-based differences in frequency of PEx, antibiotic duration, treatment location and treatment response at our institution.",

Patients with a history of lung-transplant were excluded. Baseline demographic variables were obtained and differences were determined using chi-squared testing for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. The primary outcome of interest was the frequency of PEx between women and men. A PEx was defined as a worsening of respiratory symptoms coupled with treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Secondary outcomes measured were antibiotic duration, treatment location and treatment response for those patients with pre-and post-PEx spirometry data. For comparisons between the groups, unpaired t-tests were used to compare continuous variables and Fischer's exact tests were used for categorical variables.",

Reports were submitted to the EMA (6 monthly for first 3 years then yearly) over the 5-year period July 2012 -June 2017. All patients recorded as using mannitol in the UK were followed up and matched to similar unexposed patients using annual review data from the year prior to initiating mannitol. A propensity score model was used for matching using age, BMI, percent predicted FEV 1 , medication use, hemoptysis history and presence of chronic infections. The main outcomes were hemoptysis and bronchospasm; secondary outcomes included sepsis, abscess, cough fracture and changes in microbial infections. Outcomes were compared between exposed and matched unexposed groups using logistic regression models, adjusted for baseline factors. Reasons for stopping mannitol were also recorded.",

The exposed and matched unexposed groups were similar in age, infection status, and rate of decline in FEV 1 (median 1.7% vs 1.8% per year). The exposed group had lower BMI (mean 21.75 vs 22.58; p<0.001) and baseline FEV1 (mean 59.2% vs 63.6%; p<0.001) and more days of IV antibiotic use in the year prior to exposure (mean 31 vs 24; p<0.001) and the history of hemoptysis was higher (8.84% vs 5.6%; p=0.02). Despite these baseline differences there was no significant difference in the main outcome measures of hemoptysis (11.7% vs 8.9%; p=0.397) and bronchospasm (defined by introduction of inhaled corticosteroids) 12.9% vs 13.0%, p=0.397). No events of cough fracture, pulmonary abscess or septicaemia were reported. Incidence rates (per 100 patient years) of new infections: PA 4.3 vs 4.6, SA 6.3 vs 6.8, Aspergillus 6.9 vs 4.8 (all not statistically significant), NTM 7.0 vs 7.0.

            "text": "Results: The survey showed that in 33% of Eastern European countries, not every patient had access to this therapy whereas there was full accessibility in the West. In addition, only 2 of the Eastern European countries stated that the patients were required to pay for their own treatments. In all other cases, the costs were covered by a local or national health service. With the exception of 2 clinics in Western Europe, treatment was given according to guidelines. National guidelines existed in most of the countries, but local guidelines were more common in the West. In Eastern Europe, national guidelines and ECFS guidelines were both equally used. In the Western countries, the majority of clinics followed local guidelines (43.3%) or ECFS guidelines (33.3%), while national guidelines were used by only 13.3% of the clinics. In the diagnostic block, we found few differences between the East and the West. A noticeable disparity could be seen in the involvement of specialized laboratories in detecting PSA. While 96.7% of the Western clinics worked with specialized laboratories, only 74.1% of the clinics in Eastern Europe collaborated with them. The therapy block showed only minor differences. Although different medications were used, we noticed a preference for the following: ciprofloxacin, 40 mg/kg, every 12 hours, oral over 3-5 weeks and/or tobramycin, 300 mg, every 12 hours, inhaled over 4 weeks. The majority of Eastern and Western clinics used throat swab and sputum for the check-up of the eradication success. A few Western clinics also used antibody tests.",

Our study also illustrates the complexity of a CF diagnosis in a subset of patients who do not meet standard diagnostic criteria. It demonstrates the limitations of sweat chloride testing and full sequence genetic testing, and the importance of a thorough evaluation by a pulmonologist at an accredited CF center. The mainstay therapy for acute bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is oral systemic corticosteroids. Adverse effects including hypertension, hyperglycemia, weight gain, osteoporosis, and cataracts are documented with the use of oral glucocorticoids. Case reports and small studies show high dose pulse intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone has been effective in treating ABPA, but limited data exist describing what adverse effects, if any, are associated with its use. The primary aim of this study is to determine the adverse effects associated with high dose pulse IV methylprednisolone for the treatment of ABPA in pediatric CF patients and the incidence at which they occur. Secondly, this study will evaluate the changes in pulmonary function tests and IgE serum concentrations after administration of high dose pulse IV methylprednisolone. Risk factors associated with the development of adverse effects will also be investigated.",

National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research, VA Portland Health Care System, Portland, OR, USA; 3. Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA Introduction: Ototoxicity occurs when a chemical damages inner ear sensory cells or the auditory nerve. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at risk for acquiring ototoxic hearing loss due to the preferential use of intravenous (IV) aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics for the treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a common colonizer of CF). An objective measure to detect early ototoxic changes and risk of further hearing damage would be highly valuable for CF patients. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) are an objective measure of pre-neural cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) function and can be used to assess the strength of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) reflex, an indicator of cochlear neuronal integrity. Animal models indicate that both cochlear OHCs and MOC efferent neurons are an initial target of AG-related auditory damage. This study explores the clinical utility of both TEOAEs and the MOC reflex as early indicators of ototoxicity, that when combined with other patient factors (e.g., age, gender, and AG dosing) could be used to identify patients at risk for ototoxicity.",

Clinical 226-Hz tympanometry, a test of middle ear function, was conducted to rule out middle-ear pathology (e.g., otitis media) in each patient. TEOAEs were measured to determine OHC function in response to low and moderate level clicks. Patients with present TEOAEs were then tested for their MOC reflex by presenting contralateral broadband noise to one ear as TEOAEs were recorded in the opposite ear.",

TEOAE and MOC reflex data from this study were compared to published age-matched normative data in non-CF ears with normal hearing. Preliminary data shows that patients receiving IV-AG treatments had TEOAE responses that were lower in amplitude compared to normative data and to CF patients not receiving treatment. TEOAE response growth as the stimulus level was increased from low to moderate levels showed greater variability in the treatment group. MOC reflex inhibition was also greatly reduced in CF patients on IV-AG treatment compared to both control group comparisons.",

Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA; 4. College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA Introduction: Ototoxicity (sensory hearing loss, SNHL) is a well-established side effect of life-saving intravenous aminoglycoside (AG) treatments in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Previous studies have demonstrated wide variation in the incidence of AG-induced SNHL, likely due to genetic variants, differences in pharmacokinetics, drug regimen, and kidney function. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of cumulative IV-AG exposure on hearing function in pediatric patients with CF, and to estimate exposure using pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of tobramycin and amikacin.",

Total number of lifetime IV-AG doses and demographic information was collected from the electronic medical record. Participants were placed in four quartiles based on their cumulative IV-AG exposure.

            "text": "Conclusion: Sputum-induction is superior to cough swab for pathogen detection, and is a credible approach to sampling the lower airway in symptomatic children with CF. Performing sputum-induction before BAL will correctly describe the lower airway pathogen environment in almost two-thirds of patients, and could substantially reduce the number of bronchoscopy procedures required. Both sputum induction and six-lobe BAL contribute independent, incremental gains in pathogen detection compared with the current gold-standard two-lobe BAL. We propose that sputum-induction and six-lobe BAL combined are used as standard of care for comprehensive lower airway pathogen detection in children with cystic fibrosis. Rationale: Patients with CF experience inflammation due to bacterial colonization and neutrophil recruitment that increase during an acute pulmonary exacerbation (APE). Because 20% of CF patients admitted for APE may not return to their previous spirometry baseline, CF patients and their providers are eager to restore baseline FEV 1 percent predicted (FEV 1 pp) with APE treatment. There is insufficient evidence to recommend systemic steroids during APE treatment; however, our center has utilized a 5-7 day \"rescue\" steroid burst started at least a week into admission when treatment fails to demonstrate expected improvement. We hypothesized that rescue steroids do not result in significantly improved FEV 1 pp compared to matched controls.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical trials often utilize time to first pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) or total number of PEx as endpoints. These outcomes fail to capture patterns or timing of exacerbations and can incompletely capture how covariates influence the risk of further exacerbations. Analysis of gap times between exacerbations provides a better framework to understand risks of subsequent PEx in children with cystic fibrosis. Gap time models can be adapted to account for the progressive nature of chronic diseases or infections in biomedical studies by including previous number of exacerbations in the model. We propose a statistical model to explain elevated risks after exacerbations and when and how these risks return to some baseline level. We demonstrate these methods on data from individuals enrolled in the Early Pseudomonas Infection Control (EPIC) study and provide a summary of multiple adaptations of these models. We found that a change-point provided a better fit to the data and that risk of a subsequent exacerbation dropped after approximately 1.8 years. Furthermore, we determined that increased number of copies of the \u0394F508 mutation and female gender were associated with higher rates for time to first exacerbation and greater risks of having a future exacerbation, and higher numbers of previous exacerbations were also significantly associated with greater risks of having an exacerbation. Introduction: Oral antibiotics are frequently prescribed for pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Antibiotics may be prescribed during clinic visits or via telephone triage following family-initiated contact for increased respiratory symptoms. However, antibiotic prescribing patterns and patient outcomes are not well understood. The objective of this study was to characterize the frequency of antibiotic prescriptions in clinic and by telephone triage in our pediatric CF center. We also sought to characterize symptoms leading to oral antibiotic prescriptions and to determine the number of hospitalizations within the 3 months following an oral antibiotic course.",

Pediatrics, Universitair Ziekenhuis, Antwerpen, Belgium Introduction: High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) therapy for airway clearance (AWC) is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A limitation is requirement for AC power. A mobile HFCWO device (mHFCWO) that generates chest wall pressure and oscillating airflow comparable to standard HFCWO (stdHFCWO) devices is now available. Our study evaluated effectiveness of the mHFCWO (The Monarch \u00ae System) compared to stdHFCWO (The Vest \u00ae System).",

Patients were randomized to mHFCWO or stdHFCWO day 1. Each subject received alternate therapy after a washout period (2 -7 days) . Subjects performed 1 morning treatment each day. 4 subjects performed an afternoon treatment. Treatments were 30 minutes, multiple frequencies, with intensity settings 6 to 10 on each device. Subjects collected sputum during 30-minute therapy and 1-hour posttherapy. We compared mean wet weight of sputum. To further evaluate mHFCWO therapy, CT scans were done before therapy and after sputum collection. Functional respiratory imaging (FRI), described by De Backer and coworkers (Radiology. 2010; 257:854-62 ) was used to evaluate airway geometry using CT scans. Brody scores were performed on CT scans by a radiologist blinded to the study.",

Patients were treated with repeated 2 to 3 minute cycles of each modality with rests for forced expirations and expectoration as required. Dosage (number of cycles and number of treatments) was individualised.

Take Five is a verbal cue system. Staff exiting a patient's room address the next provider by saying \"take 5\" and the oncoming person then has five minutes to get report, put on personal protective equipment, and enter the patient room. We measured visits for 67 patients before the initiative and 70 after. Wait episodes were defined as any period following check-in at the front desk that families were not face-to-face with staff. Episodes were categorized as short (0-5 minutes), moderate (6-9), long (10-14), and excessive (\u226515). To measure the process, we time-stamped multiple clinic dates.

We found that families averaged six waiting episodes per visit, and prior to Take Five spent an average of 36 total minutes waiting. After the intervention this decreased to 22 minutes. Wait time as a percent of total visit time dropped from 35% to 23%, and the average wait per episode decreased 45%, from 6.5 to 3.6 minutes.

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Lurie Children's), the 2014 CF Foundation's Patient Registry data revealed the median FEV1 percent predicted (ppFEV 1 ) for patients 6 to 17 years of age was below the national average since 2011. When comparing overall ppFEV 1 over the past 10 years, our ppFEV 1 rose little (from 85.8% to 89.9%), while the country rose from 85.8% to 92.5%. As a result, we initiated a quality improvement project called REACT: the Re-Education of Airway Clearance Techniques. The REACT program was originally designed and implemented by Dr. Zanni in 2006 and he reported an increase in median ppFEV 1 of 9% in 6-17 years old after implementing REACT (Zanni RL, et al. BMJ Qual Saf. 2014; 23:i50-5) .",

Not all children were screened within the 0-5 age range. Additionally, the ASQ is a family driven questionnaire and at times, parents verbalize anxiety about having one more thing to be concerned about (ie, delayed development) and may not accurately answer questions. Also, while the ASQ benefits a clinic setting, there is an overall lack of standardized tools that are time efficient to be performed in most outpatient clinical settings. Finally, future aims should address prevention of DD in a population not previously identified as being at-risk, as well as family education on appropriate development and enhancement of such development. Other factors that may influence or exacerbate delay, ie, socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, adherence to additional treatment plans/recommendations, and severity of disease should be included in future interventions.

Patients undergo a structured educational component and exercise training. Education includes: infection control, airway clearance techniques, sleep hygiene, disease management, benefits of exercise, utilization of community resources, anatomy/physiology of the lung and coping skills for anxiety and depression. Treadmill and weight machines are utilized for aerobic and strength training purposes. Sessions are customized based on individual need.

The creation of a CF-specific program is safe, feasible and usually covered by health insurance. Goals of CF PR are unique and include augmentation of stamina and management of symptoms during physical activity, but also increase knowledge and comfort with airway clearance and exercise training in CF disease management. CF-specific PR guidelines are needed to provide structure and uniformity so that these types of programs can be available at CF care centers around the country. 1, 2 1. Medicine, Loyola Univ.

Factors that contribute to muscle weakness in adults with CF and its clinical implications need to be investigated further. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) recommends aerobic exercise for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients of all ages as an adjunctive therapy for airway clearance and for its additional benefits to overall health, including higher quality of life scores, lower anxiety and depression scores, and better adherence. Exercise also helps to maintain lung function, maintain good posture, build muscle strength, and increase endurance. The 2015 CFF Patient Registry Report showed 45.2% of adults identify exercise as one of their methods of airway clearance. This data is consistent with patient data from our center (44.6%); however, exercise is more prevalent as the primary airway clearance method.",

Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2014; 189:A3036) in which a flowmeter recorded the waveforms of healthy volunteers and an average profile was scaled so the peak expiratory flow rate was 30 L/min, being more patient representative. This waveform was then used to operate, via a breathing simulator, a range of different OPEP devices: Aerobika* (TMI, Canada); vPEP (D R Burton, US); VibraPEP (Curaplex, US); Acapella Choice (Smiths Medical, US); Flutter (Axcan, US), (n=3 devices, 3 replicates of each). The pressure / time waveforms were recorded for each device, set at their highest resistance to enable direct comparison. Analysis of each device waveform was performed in order to determine the total pressure pulse impact around optimum oscillation frequency (TPPI F ). This is defined and calculated as the sum of all discernable (>1.0 cm H 2 O) pressure pulse amplitudes, in a single exhalation waveform, that are in the frequency range of 10-15 Hz.",

Respir Care. 2017; 62(4) :451) and b) effectiveness is optimized at a frequency of approximately 13 Hz (Silva CEA, et al. Respir Care. 2009; 54(11) :1480-7). The TPPI F values showed the Aerobika* device to be the most effective, with a 54% higher value than the second ranking device and more than four times the value of the lowest performing device. The combination of pressure and frequency in assessing device performance also supports the value of a pressure manometer attachment to OPEP devices. It is recognized that the implications of these reported laboratory differences should be assessed in a clinical setting also, however they do provide useful relevant insights when selecting a device for clinical practice.",

One variable that has been a focus of attention is the role of excercise as it relates to quality of life in CF patients (Collaco JM, et al. BMC Pulm Med. 2014; 14:159) . Thus far, studies aimed at determining an association between exercise and quality of life have produced mixed results (Schmidt AM, et al. Physiother Theor Pract. 2011; 27:548-56; Rovedder PM, et al. Respir Med. 2014; 108:1134-40; Hebestreit H, et al. BMC Pulm Med. 2014; 14:9) . Although results have been variable, there is a positive association between exercise and quality of life in the general population. Furthermore, physical activity has been shown to be safe in CF. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assess regular exercise and health-related quality of life in CF. This study aims to evaluate personal fitness devices (PFD) in adults with CF.",

Next, it appears that patients with higher FEV1 were enrolled initially (average FEV1 62.3% for first 12 versus 54.4% for final 8 patients). As follow-up data for those with more advanced disease are included, it would be reasonable to expect a clearer signal of improvement. Furthermore, there was an increase in 6MWT distance (though not statistically significant), which may become more apparent as 12-month data are collected.

Telemetric monitoring was facilitated through a Bluetooth-enabled eFlow rapid nebulizer (PARI Pharma GmbH, Germany), which recorded the period during which the device was nebulizing medication. Data were wirelessly transmitted from the nebulizer via a paired mobile phone to a central server for data analysis. The total study duration was set out to be 6 months, of which only the first 3 months were telemetrically monitored. Patients had a consultation with their physician at three points: (1) study start, (2) between the two phases and (3) at the study end. During the consultation, the lung function parameters FEV 1 , FVC, MEF25, BMI-Z scores and other clinical parameters were measured. There was no special intervention to increase therapy adherence.

New technology, like apps with gamification may offer opportunities to help these patients engage with their disease and follow their therapy more diligently. Background: Oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) devices are indicated for the removal of excess secretions and reduce gas trapping in patients with hypersecretory pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). OPEP works when the patient exhales actively against a fixed resistor, generating mean intrapulmonary pressures of 10-20 cmH 2 O with rapid fluctuations of at least 1 cmH 2 O. The recommended duration of expiration, not including breath-hold, is 3-4 times the length of inspiration representing an inspiration: expiration (I:E) ratio of 1: 3 or 1: 4. This prolonged, steady exhalation splints open collapsed small airways. The cycle should be repeated 10-20 times with 2-3 additional \"huff\" coughs to clear any loosened secretions.",

Introduction: High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) vests are the current standard of care to help manage certain respiratory conditions. Although they have been shown to result in increased mobilization of mucus, the mechanism of action is not fully understood. One postulated mechanism is increased cephalad airflow bias, but it remains unclear if evidence for this effect is supported by standard clinical spirometry measurements. We performed this study to investigate short-term application of motor and compressor-based HFCWO vests on spirometry parameters TV, PEF, FVC, FEV1 and FEF25-75%.

Furthermore, airflow measurements taken at the subject's mouth have not been correlated to any effects in the flexible airways, where cephalad airflow bias results in mucus mobilization.

In contrast, nearly two-third of caregivers (65%, n=72) self-reported high adherence and only 8% (n=9) self-reported low adherence (p<0.001). Nearly half of caregivers (46%) overestimated their adherence. In multiple logistic regression adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, adherence overestimation was associated with multiple ACT locations (OR 5.30, p<0 .05) and prescribed ACT duration \u2265 60 min (OR 3.85, p<0.05). Among patients with prescribed ACT \u2265 60 min, after adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, income <$50,000 increased 3-fold the odds of overestimating adherence (OR 3.04, p<0.05).",

The observations here warrant further study into the true effect of exercise on FEV1, in a controlled setting with a larger sample size, possibly multicenter and statistically similar groups. Introduction: Exercise, physical activity and airway clearance have been shown to decrease the decline of lung function over time in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Future and ongoing analysis of the effect of PT on pediatric antibiotic days, adult and pediatric quality of life measures (AweScore), physical activity scores (Habitual Activity Estimation Score), and measures of aerobic capacity are needed to correlate the decrease in IV antibiotic days in patients with PT intervention. Additional analysis of subsequent years is also required to further validate these observed data trends. . Application of these criteria in pediatrics can be challenging. This pediatric CF center had no formal process for determining or communicating PFT reliability to the data coordinator. All PFT values of pediatric CF patients were being entered in the CFFPR, potentially affecting CFFPR data accuracy, patient summary reports, and possibly causing undue anxiety in patients/caregivers.

From Dec 2016 -Aug 2017: Out of the 55 patients initially evaluated, 4% of those evaluated were denied services due to poor education of insurance providers, 35% received OP services, 27% were followed at their quarterly CF clinic visits, 23% refused PT services when recommended, and 11% were unable to receive PT services due to poor procedures in scheduling them in a timely manner.",

Patients were stratified by BMI (kg/m 2 ) \u2265 or < 17 at the time of LTx. Analyses were restricted to COPD and IPF patients with bilateral LTx, because patients with CF only undergo bilateral LTx and survival with bilateral LTx is superior to single LTx. We calculated Kaplan-Meier estimates of median post-LTx survival by diagnosis and within the BMI strata for patients with CF. We used Cox proportional hazards (PH) modeling to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of post-LTx mortality (censored at lost to follow-up; includes time following a repeat LTx if applicable) for patients with CF and IPF, with COPD as the reference group. Cox PH models were adjusted for mean annual LTx center volume and calendar year of LTx.",

Median post-transplant survival for patients with CF and BMI <17 (n=351) was 7.0 years (95% CI 4.5, 7.9); patients with IPF (all BMIs) 6.5 years (6.1, 7.1) and patients with COPD (all BMIs) 6.5 years (6.2, 7.0). Compared to COPD, the unadjusted and adjusted HR (95% CI) for post-transplant mortality for CF patients with BMI <17 were both 1.06 (0.89, 1.25) . For IPF patients the unadjusted and adjusted HR relative to COPD were both 1.04 (0.96, 1.12).

Patients with COPD and BMI <17 had no difference in post-LTx mortality compared to non-underweight COPD patients (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80, 1.79). Less than 1% of patients with IPF had BMI <17.",

In written responses, many providers described PC as important for those who are not pursuing or not eligible for transplant to help with care planning; some felt it is also helpful for those who are waiting for transplant. Those who emphasized the importance of PC throughout the transplant process noted that changing goals of care, decision making, and symptom management are common concerns along the continuum. Some described feeling that the goals of transplant and PC are mutually exclusive, equating them with life extension and end of life, respectively. Caregivers described the importance of PC throughout the transplant process given medical and emotional vulnerability and emphasized the need for individualized care.",

Further studies are needed to better understand how PC fits into lung transplant care for individuals with CF. Clarification of what PC entails and dispelling myths about the goals of transplant and PC being in conflict can be addressed through PC education for patients, caregivers, and providers. Background: We previously showed that bone mass was reduced and bone quality severely impaired in rib specimens from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients collected at the time of lung transplant (LTx). To prevent further deterioration of bone due to the immunosuppressive therapy, osteoporosis medications are initiated soon after LTx in most patients. However, very little is known about long-term bone mineral density (BMD) changes in CF patients after LTx.",

Median Z-scores for LS and FN BMD were -1.4 (IQR -2.1 to -0.7) and -1.1 (IQR -1.8 to -0.3) respectively. While 20% of patients were on bisphosphonate therapy in the three months preceding LTx (average dose: 7.8\u00b12.7 mg/d), the proportion and doses increased substantially in the post-LTx period from 84% of patients at 6 months (15\u00b147 mg/d) to 97% at 10 years (19\u00b153 mg/d).

The majority of respondents endorsed experiencing pain related to their CF disease (83%), 59% reported having their pain actively managed by a healthcare provider, and 31% reported having an official chronic pain diagnosis. The most common types of pain reported were nonsinus related headaches (70%), lower back pain (65%), acid reflux (65%), sinus pain (65%), abdominal pain, (60%) and joint pain (58%). Participants reported experiencing an average of six different types of pain (range 0-12). A total of 37% reported that pain often or always affected daily life, 24% reported pain affected mood a lot or a great deal, and 35% reported experiencing pain daily. Clinically, respondents reported discussing pain with their CF (56%) and primary care (30%) teams more than their transplant team (17%), while in the social setting pain was mostly discussed with significant others (35%). Acetaminophen was the most commonly used over-the counter medication (92%). Twenty-six (70%) reported receiving prescription pain medications and 30% reported receiving an opioid; 73% of those receiving prescriptions reported receiving more than one type of prescription pain medication. Alcohol (8%) was the most commonly reported nonprescribed substance used for pain relief and 5% reported using nonprescribed oxycodone Hot packs (50%) and exercise (36%) were the most common nonpharmacologic therapies used for pain. Procedural pain relief was used by some, including steroid injections (10%) and nerve blocks (10%). Conclusions: Pain attributable to CF is common in those who have undergone lung transplantation, with a prevalence similar to that experienced by the general CF population. Those with pain desire management help from their CF care providers, and many receive multiple prescriptions for pain medications including opioids. There is a need to further explore pain and the use of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies in this population to improve health outcomes and quality of life.

            "text": "Results: In total, 43,937 FEV 1 measurements from 8535 healthy individuals ranging in age from 6 to 80 years old were used to define the reproducibility of FEV 1 . The between-subject variability of FEV 1 was much greater than the within-subject variability between successive measurements, confirming that comparison of individual results to a reference range cannot be used to accurately track individual disease progress. The correlation between repeated measurements was independent of age, but decreased with time (r = 0.874 -0.034*time(years)), such that the correlation for measurements 3 months apart is 0.87. Adjusting for the initial lung function a change score can be estimated (zFEV 1 (current) -r*zFEV 1 (previous))/ (\u221a(1-r 2 ). A change score within \u00b11.96 is considered within the normal limits of reproducibility, whereas values outside this range reflect either a meaningful deterioration or improvement. For example, a drop from -1.5 Z-scores (~82% predicted) to -2.3 Z-scores (~71% predicted) in 3 months is calculated to be outside the limits of normal variability, and therefore a meaningful deterioration. Contrarily, an increase in FEV 1 from -1.5 Z-scores (~82% predicted) to -0.5 Z-scores (~93% predicted) in 3 months is within the expected range of normal variability, and would not be considered meaningful. When applied to 48,711 stable FEV 1 measurements from 1098 CF patients (ranging in age from 5-74 years old), 82.4% of stable visits were within the range of variability in health, whereas 15.2% were identified as having a meaningful drop and 3.7% were increasing significantly. Notably, only 46.1% of stable visits were within a 10% relative change in FEV 1 percent predicted. Further analysis will investigate application of the change score for pulmonary exacerbations and monitoring treatment effects.",

Introduction: The median age of survival (MSA) for Canadians living with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been a useful estimate to inform people born with CF today of their expected survival. However, it is of limited use to those patients currently living with CF, many of whom have reached or even surpassed the median survival age of a given CF population. Further, several countries have reported lower median survival age in females with CF. It is unclear how the survival age varies dependent on reaching a given age and whether the survival sex gap persists in individuals who have lived past a certain age. The objectives of our study were to (1) calculate conditional survival estimates for Canadians living with CF over time, (2) examine whether there is a sex-based conditional survival gap at varying ages, and (3) to compare the factors that influence risk of death before and after 30 years of age.",

It seems more reasonable to have at least 2 chloride values in the borderline range before defining a baby as CFSPID. Introduction: Following the introduction of newborn screening for CF in 2007, we implemented a pathway to inform, diagnose and educate parents whose child had a positive screening result. This pathway was developed to incorporate the UK national standards for delivering results within 5 working days. However, there is no universally agreed approach to how the information is delivered to families when the CF centre receives the result indicating a sweat test is required. We have followed the same pathway whereby the CF Nurse Specialist (CNS) delivers the presumed positive result face-to-face alongside the family's Health Visitor in the family home. Once diagnosis is confirmed the next day, we invite the family to attend a 2-day education programme facilitated by the CNS incorporating all members of the multidisciplinary team. It is known that initial diagnosis and education can influence parental adjustment and commitment to the CF team and care process. Although anecdotally we have had positive feedback from families, we have not formally reviewed the process. We wished to evaluate parental experience.",

This group of CF carriers includes those whose mutations were found to be in cis or were retroactively determined to be non-CF causing (e.g. 1525-42G>A and -741T>G). California's CF newborn screening algorithm begins with measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) on all newborn blood spot specimens. Screen-positive specimens based on a high IRT cutoff receive additional testing using a panel of 40 known deleterious CFTR mutations designed for California's diverse population. Specimens with two panel mutations identified (0.4% of high IRT) were immediately reported as screen-positive for CF. Specimens with one panel mutation identified (5.3% of high IRT) were further tested by focused DNA sequencing, which can detect previously known as well as novel mutations/variants. Specimens with one panel mutation and no further mutations/variants identified through focused sequencing were reported as CF carriers and those with additional mutations identified were reported as screen-positive for CF. All screen-positive cases were referred for diagnostic testing and evaluation at one of 15 CF specialty care centers in the state, which also ordered molecular testing on parent samples in some cases. Mothers of newborns identified as CF carriers were sent a letter notifying them of their child's carrier status and they were offered free telephone genetic counseling. Approximately 9.1% of families with newborns identified as CF carriers received genetic counseling through this service. Screen-negative cases include specimens with low IRT, or specimens that had an elevated IRT and no panel mutations identified. Among the 42 false negative CF cases, 21 (50%) were missed due to low IRT, 15 (36%) were missed due to rare mutations not included on the CFTR mutation panel, and 6 (14%) were missed due to no additional mutations identified by DNA sequencing. The ratio of CF screen-positive cases to confirmed cases was 2.9:1. Overall CF prevalence was 1 in 7,911 births.

Weight-for-length (WFL) should be measured monthly in the first year of life and then every 3 months if meeting nutritional goals. If not, then measurements may need to be more frequent (J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2002; 35:246-59) .

From an early age, patients with cystic fibrosis often experience stepwise declines in lung function following acute worsening of chronic bacterial infections. To date, no protocols have been published by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation regarding clinic-based management of pulmonary exacerbations in children. We hypothesize that with a standardized protocol to treat decline in lung function, patients will better maintain pulmonary function over time.

In patient populations unable to perform PFTs, symptoms are the primary indicator of the presence and severity of an exacerbation, and depending on severity of respiratory symptoms and the presence of other systemic symptoms (weight loss, fever, hemoptysis), therapy is escalated accordingly. To assess the algorithm's capability to parallel provider judgement regarding exacerbation management, patients demonstrating increased pulmonary symptoms were evaluated by providers while a concurrent algorithm-based assessment was performed. Immediately following the patient encounter, providers were informed of the algorithm recommendations and asked to evaluate the appropriateness of algorithm-recommended treatment modifications, laboratory work-up, and follow-up time via survey.",

Pulmonology, Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, MO, USA Introduction: Cystic fibrosis hospitalizations can be very difficult for patients and their families. Patients requiring frequent hospitalization are often disengaged from inpatient care due to physical and emotional health issues. Cooperation with and active participation in prescribed therapies (airway clearance, nutrition, exercise) varies among patients but may have a significant effect on the outcome of hospitalization. Weight gain, return to previous baseline pulmonary function, and duration of a hospital stay may be influenced by patient engagement. Recurrent struggles with adherence to therapy can lead to frustration among inpatient care team members. CF Care Team (CFCT) members recognized this challenge and developed an Inpatient Expectation Agreement (IEA) to improve patient engagement with care, staff-patient interactions, and improve outcomes of hospitalization.",

Following discussion, it was decided that children school-age and above would receive the IEA. Additionally, the CFPFAC suggested the use of an unsigned \"agreement\" rather than \"contract\" requiring signature. Hospital administration (Patient Advocates and Risk Management) approved the final IEA. A decision was made that the ambulatory CFCT would present the IEA and discuss with the patient/family at the time of hospital admission. An algorithm for IEA use was developed.

Pediatrics, University of Vermont Children's Hospital, Burlington, VT, USA Background: Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) require more energy to breathe normally, fight lung infections and compensate for fat malabsorption. Maintaining adequate nutrition has been associated with higher pulmonary function. For these reasons, patients with CF require more calories than people without CF. Energy needs of people with CF are estimated to be 1\u00bd to 2 times the needs of those without CF. For some patients and families the financial burden associated with the cost of these additional calorie needs is more than their household budget can allow. A quality improvement project was performed on the inpatient pediatric service at the University of Vermont Children's Hospital to increase screening for food insecurity (FI), a social determinant of health, using the Hunger Vital Sign. The Hunger Vital Sign is a validated two-question screening tool that assesses the risk for FI. The Hunger Vital Sign is embedded in the CMS Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool, which we built into our version of Epic. Because of this process, we discovered that up to 24% of inpatient CF patients had positive FI screens compared to the known rate of 14% of household FI in Vermont.",

This suggests a need to screen patients and families with CF for FI in clinic and provide reliable interventions based on the negative potential impact of FI. Screening for FI in pediatric and adult CF clinics can be performed using the Hunger Vital Sign with support from patients and families. Innovative strategies to intervene for patients who have a positive FI screen should be explored, including a food pantry. Successful implementation of a FI screening process suggests that CF centers should consider screening for other social determinants of health due to the frequency of visits patients with CF have with their CF center and the integration of social work in the CF clinic. Objective: Because of different nutritional needs, psychosocial maturity levels, and use of aggressive interventions we sought to develop a standardized algorithm to implement across our center based on age groups and patient/family acceptance of interventions. We are a new center with largely a young CF population and found wide variability of nutrition interventions being used among providers at different times in the disease process and in different settings. We wanted to be conscious of the different maturity levels of our patients and patient/family acceptance of interventions, and tailor interventions accordingly. We developed our algorithm to provide family-and patient-centered care based on the different needs of diverse age groups while adhering to known successful interventions appropriate per age. For the greatest impact on long-term nutritional and pulmonary outcomes, our algorithm is more aggressive with our younger subset. The goal of this initial project was for >50% of our patients 0-2 years old to have a weight for length (W/L) >50th percentile (%ile) on the WHO growth chart.",

Patient review sheets were utilized to ensure annual labs, chest x-ray, oral glucose tolerance tests, and DEXA scans were completed. Review sheets were placed in the patient's chart on the day of clinic for provider to utilize. While this process worked efficiently and effectively for the team, we recognized a lack of input and collaboration from patients and their families. Therefore, we aimed to increase the involvement of families in pre-visit planning from 0% to 25% by September 30, 2017. This goal was met by December 2017. Our new goal for 2018 is to have 75% pre-visit participation by December 2018. To more successfully meet the annual goal of 75% participation, monthly review of participation rates will be monitored. Our monthly pre-visit participation goal has been set at 50%.",

These portals have been well received by parents of children with chronic conditions. Research into patient portals in pediatric care has explored their ease of use for families. However, little research has been conducted specifically in families with CF. The aims of this study were to 1) assess at baseline and 10 months after implementation the attitudes of families about how patient and carer-facing applications (apps) impacts communication; 2) to explore the experiences of patients/families with CF communicating with hospital staff using the My Health Memory (MHM) app. Its initial functions included syncing appointments with the native phone calendar, with links to information about the appointment and telehealth app when requested, rescheduling appointments, messages to allied health and nursing, and storage of communication in the patients' electronic health record held at the hospital and the family's phone.",

Pediatric Pulmonology, JHU/APL, Baltimore, MD, USA Background: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) often report poor sleep, increased daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Prior studies have not consistently demonstrated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in CF. Polysomnography (PSG) has mainly been performed to assess hypoxemia or the need for noninvasive ventilation in severe, end-stage lung disease. Treatment of OSA has been shown to improve nutritional status in CF (MacDonald KD, et al. Respir Care. 2009; 54(12):1727-31) . We previously demonstrated altered respiratory patterns during sleep, particularly increased inspiratory flow limitation (IFL) and respiratory rate, in children with CF compared to healthy controls that are independent of age, BMI, and lung function (Paranjape S, et al. Pediatrics. 2015; 136(5) :920-6).",

A brief review of our current QI initiatives was presented. Family partners were surveyed to determine which initiatives would receive top priority for the upcoming academic year. Our family partners had the strongest interest in mental health screening for caregivers, which we discussed in further detail in a subsequent team meeting. During this meeting, the CFIP team designed a process map to define the first steps for implementing screening for caregiver depression and anxiety.

Once established, we created a Key Driver Diagram (KDD) to guide implementation and tracking of improvements. Utilizing QI methodology, our focus was on early recognition of decline in lung function. Patients with a 10% or greater decline in lung function from their best in the past year were put into the \"red zone\" category. Our SMART Aim was to decrease the percent of patients with lung function in the red zone from 16.1% to 15% over the first year. Our journey to improve outcomes has included a bundle of initiatives. Using the KDD as a guide, we began with weekly emails to the care team with a list of patients who had fallen into the red zone. The team reviews patients against the algorithm to be sure that all steps have been taken to return them to their baseline best. A checklist is used in team meetings to ensure that each key aspect of care is discussed. Along with our Infectious Disease, Microbiology and Pharmacy colleagues, we created an Antibiotic Guideline which provides a first and second line choice of antibiotics, along with dosing recommendations, for each of the common CF bacteria. We implemented a process to involve primary CF physicians into the inpatient care of patients, utilizing an admission goal sheet and an inpatient care guideline.",

With the algorithm as a guide, we identified a gap, determining that patients were not consistently being asked to follow-up in a timely manner. With focus on this, we tracked how often providers asked patients new to the red zone to return for follow-up within 28 days of the decline and treatment. We have seen this improve from 68% to 90%.

The CF Learning Network (CFLN) is a collaborative network created to improve health, care, and time for people with cystic fibrosis (CF). An integral part of improving care in the CFLN is to co-produce with patients and families impacted by the disease. Co-production is the collaborative communication between lived experience of CF and those with CF knowledge expertise. Centers meet and discuss patients coming to a clinic visit and formulate a plan of care without any involvement of patients/ families. Pre-visit planning (PVP) serves to take the experience of people with CF to the care teams prior to the upcoming clinic visit. In CFLN, our team began the implementation of the PVP process in November 2016. The aim of the study was to empower adults to share their concerns and needs in a collaborative manner prior to the clinic visit. The electronic patient portal (EPP) system became active in January 2016 and provides documentation in the medical records. A memo encouraging clinical communication to be conducted via the EPP was sent electronically via mail and reinforced at each clinic visit by team. The PVP message was developed in collaboration with the Partner Advisory Board and delivered through EPP. The PVP message included the specific team members the patient wished to communicate with, topic to discuss or specific question to ask a team member. The PVP responses are reviewed in the weekly pre-clinic meeting and a personalized care plan is developed. After a test phase, data collection began in August 2017. Data points included date PVP was sent, date patient responded, did the patient attend the clinic visit, type of clinic visit, time patient arrived in the clinic and time patient was discharged from the clinic, and lastly, which interdisciplinary members participated in the clinic visit. The number of patients scheduled for clinic visits from August 2017 to April 2018 were 935. The total PVP sent out was 681. 223 patients responded to the PVP (32.3%). The data were stratified to examine patients who responded to the PVP and attended the clinic visit (155 patients) or responded to the PVP and did not attend clinic (68 patients). 336 patients attended clinic and did not respond to the PVP vs 122 patients who did not respond to the PVP and did not attend clinic. The average time to response to the PVP was 11.1 days. Team members (MD, RN, RD, SW, RT, Pharm.) participated in the clinic visit approximately 82% of the time except for the dietitian due to staff changes (52%). Adults who responded to the PVP spent an average of 158 minutes versus patients who did not respond to the PVP who had an average time of 146 minutes. CF adults desire to be more engaged and their concerns/needs to be actively discussed at clinic visits. Subjectively, the team felt empowered to collaborate with the patients who responded to the PVP including co-creating care plan. Use of the EPP serves as a good platform for PVP. Potential barriers include lack of access, smart phone capability, and health literacy. Our experience has shown that adults with CF selectively choose whether to respond given their perception of clinical importance. McPhail, G.L.; Mullen, L.; Weiland, J.; Wimmers, H.; Selker, N.; Chapman, M.; Siracusa, C. Pulmonary, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA Background: Incorporating families' priorities into pre-visit clinic planning (PVP) facilitates partnership and co-production. Since 2001, the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) CF team has worked to incorporate the voice of the family in PVP. The initial approach was a paper survey, developed by families and clinicians, mailed to families with a self-addressed stamped envelope in which to return a completed survey. The response rate was low and the project was discontinued. The second approach was to send a survey for families to access via the family portal of the electronic medical record (MyChart). The response rate was low at 5%, possibly because \"pre-visit survey\" could not be included in the subject line of the message sent to families or because the volume of MyChart messages received by families was high. HIPAA and hospital regulations were barriers to using email and online formats to improve PVP response rates. In 2016, the CCHMC CF team joined the CF Learning Network. We learned new ideas to facilitate co-producing PVP with families.",

Evidence suggests that PPI use >1 year can lead to an increased risk of bone fractures, pneumonia, C difficile infections, and malabsorption of vitamins (D Johnson, et al. Clin Gastroentero Hepatol. 2013; 11:458-64) . H2RAs are an alternative with fewer potential complications. Chronic PPI use may contribute to potential effects on microbiology and bone health. Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend an 8-week course to treat GERD. Literature encourages clinicians to attempt to de-escalate or discontinue use of PPI. Primary objective of this quality improvement study is to educate our center's patients on the risks associated with chronic PPI use, examine the rationale for initial PPI prescription, and de-escalate or discontinue PPI therapy when appropriate.",

Patients were asked about the PPI indication, duration of use, medications failed, lifestyle/ diet changes, and side effects. Patients were educated on the potential side effects of chronic PPI therapy and asked one of the following: willingness to discontinue, decrease dose, or switch to a H2RA. Those patients that did decrease dose or switch to a H2RA received a follow-up telephone call from the pharmacist at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year. Repeat completion of the iCan GI Symptom Tracker occurs at subsequent quarterly visits. Lung transplant, chronic steroid use, and incarcerated patients were excluded.

Introduction: Quarterly cystic fibrosis (CF) patient visits with the CF team ensures early detection of lung function changes and improves outcomes. Our program started a quality improvement (QI) initiative in 2014 to improve patient participation to clinic quarterly. Over the past 4 years, we continued this initiative, and ran multiple plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles in order to improve our process. Our team participated in Learning and Leadership Collaborative (LLC) 2015-2016, Virtual Improvement Program (VIP) 2016-2017 and in July of 2017, our adult CF program applied and was invited to participate in the Cystic Fibrosis Learning Network (CFLN). As part of CFLN we aimed to improve patient team communication pre-clinic to better address patient needs and we integrated a new process (pre-visit planning or PVP) in quarterly visits QI.",

During fall 2017, a PVP survey was designed by the care team with the assistance of our patient partner. Patients who are scheduled to be seen in clinic are called by the AA to confirm their appointments 1-7 days in advance, during these phone calls the AA also administers the PVP surveys. At the beginning of this process, patients were surveyed on their preferred PVP contact method and over the past 2 months, we have begun contacting them via their preferred method of communication. A list of confirmations and all PVP responses are shared with the team via email; data are also stored in a secure server. Each care team member sends an email 1-2 days before clinic with a list of patients they would like to see, the reasons, and desired lab tests. Itineraries are created for the patients according to their PVP answers and their needs.",

We started administering the PVP questionnaires in December 2017 and so far 68 patients have been surveyed, with a 61% response rate. Since changing to patient's preferred method of contact, the patient response has increased by 21%. At the beginning of the year, our program started participating in CF HealthCheck; so far we have enrolled 9 patients. For the next few months, our team will concentrate on combining surveys and questionnaires into one pre-visit message through MyChart. Our organization is requesting all providers change all patient communications to MyChart. This will be another challenge and PDSA for our team. Patients found the pre-visit planning survey helpful (87%) and staff satisfaction with the survey was 100%.",

The team also decided which ancillary specialists would see which patients during their upcoming clinic visits. In an effort to increase co-production of care, a need for improved PVP was identified. Due to the size of the adult CF patient population, a sustainable and efficient method for conducting PVP with patient input was needed.

We anticipate that response rate will improve once we have educated our patients about the goals and benefits of the system. Introduction: Individuals with CF are estimated to require 1.5-2 times the nutritional needs of those without CF. A diet high in fat and calories is recommended, with fat contributing about 40% of caloric intake. BMI can be impacted by food and beverage intake. CF patients tend to consume an excessive amount of saturated fat, while having a low intake of polyunsaturated fat. Shifting the focus from high saturated, trans-fat and calorie-dense foods and beverages, to nutritionally-dense foods and beverages, we aimed to provide distinctive nutrition education to make smarter food choices to assist them in reaching the CF Foundation's BMI goals (\u2265 22 kg/m 2 for women and \u2265 23 kg/m 2 for men). 41% of our adult CF population was below BMI goal.",

A team member then reviewed their results with a STOP-LIGHT System which listed categories of foods based on both calorie and nutrient density: Red (STOP!), Yellow (Caution), and Green (GO!). Red Light foods contain a large amount of calories that contain little or no nutrition. Foods listed in the Green Light category provide high protein and high calories in the form of medium-lean meats, healthy fats, and whole grains. Foods listed in the Yellow Light category fall somewhere in between Red and Green. The patients were shown where a smarter food choice could be made (eg, lemon water instead of soda) and what types of food correlated to the specific colors (eg, candy is \"Red\"). Patients then set 1-2 dietary goals for making smarter food/ beverage choices. At their next clinic visit, another 24-hour dietary recall was completed. A team member again reviewed the recall with the patient to determine if/where the patient can make further improvements.",

Individual baseline FEV1pp was calculated for each year as the average of the best value of each quarter, according to the method used for the CF Foundation registry report. Individual annual rate of decline in baseline FEV1pp from 2013-2016 was also calculated. Risk factors for rapid decline were examined using registry data. Four QI interventions were implemented. First, lung zones were created based on approximate quartiles for rate of decline, ranging from A (no decline) to D (very rapid decline >3.5%/year). Lung zone and rate of decline were added to our clinic preview sheet. Second, a table with this decline data was added to the respiratory therapist's clinic note for each patient. Third, a rapid decliner checklist was created to be completed during clinic preview for patients in the C or D zones. Fourth, a lung health algorithm for providers was generated to encourage uniformity in care and focus attention on rapid decliners.",

These improvements may be attributable to a more standardized and proactive approach to decreases in lung function and increased clinician attention to patients with rapid decline, especially those with high baseline lung function. The risk factor analysis led us to implement additional QI projects around improving CF-related diabetes control. Introduction: CF patients age 18 to 29 are at risk for decreased or halted clinic attendance and participation in their healthcare due to a variety of age related risk factors such as moving away to college and transitioning to healthcare independence. According to the 2016 CF Registry report, the national median FEV1 in this age group is 74.2%, compared with 72.5% at our center. While some patients have regular contact with their care center during this time, others are at risk for decreased contact and a decline in overall health status including FEV1. The specific aim of this project is to improve the FEV1 in this age group by 1% within the next 12 months.",

Our first Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle involved calling every patient in this age range within our center and documenting parameters pertaining to this call in centralized spreadsheet. Up to two call attempts per patient per quarter were made. Successful (or unsuccessful) contact, duration of call, next appointment status, major concern(s), and whether or not the patient was hospitalized were documented in the central spreadsheet by each QI team member conducting the call.

Rationale: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are a substantial burden for CF patients and many do not recover lost lung function. Despite this, best practices are lacking for the length, type and location (hospital or home) of IV treatments. Recent analysis showed IV treatments in the hospital were more successful than those in the home, including in return to 90% of baseline FEV 1 (Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2018; 15:225-33) . Our previous quality improvement (QI) initiatives focused on hospital care and communication. As our Home IV Antibiotic Therapy (HIAT) use was increasing, we began a QI project to similarly improve our HIAT.

The ototoxicity of aminoglycosides is well-established and individuals with CF are at an increased risk for developing hearing loss (HL) due to the toxicity of these medications. Along with concerns for auditory dysfunction, the use of aminoglycosides is also vestibulotoxic. A recent study by Handelsman and coworkers, (Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017; 52:1157-62) , investigated the vestibulotoxicity of aminoglycosides in patients with CF, finding an incidence of 79% among their cohort diagnosed with some degree of vestibular dysfunction. In previous years, patients with CF were not routinely referred for a comprehensive audiologic and vestibular evaluation. A quality improvement (QI) initiative to obtain baseline hearing and vestibular evaluations and establish an audiologic protocol was developed and incorporated into the routine care for patients with CF seen at the Univ. of Chicago Medicine (UCM). By obtaining baseline and follow-up evaluations, UCM established a monitoring program to assess the auditory and vestibular systems, increased early identification of patients with HL, and identified ways to preserve hearing, while also educating our patients on the importance of hearing protection due to the synergistic effects of noise exposure during treatment with ototoxic medications.",

The need also exists to establish ototoxicity monitoring guidelines and recommendations through the CF Foundation. Introduction: Compliance with airway clearance therapy (ACT) and optimizing airway clearance are significant challenges in cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary management. These challenges need effective management to ensure airway clearance is optimized and lung health is maintained. The Duke Pediatric Pulmonary Function Laboratory administers an annual and a follow-up needs assessment questionnaire for CF patients. The follow-up questionnaire is conducted every 3 months to ensure knowledge is maintained in three important areas: pulmonary medications, ACT, and infection control. Knowledge in these areas is important to optimize lung health and facilitate the transition from the pediatric pulmonary function lab to the adult pulmonary function lab. Ultimately, the questionnaire is a systematic approach to maintain and reinforce knowledge in pulmonary medications, ACT, and infection control. The aim of this quality improvement (QI) project was to assess the impact of this systematic approach on optimal airway clearance devices and settings. The ultimate goal is to remedy suboptimal airway clearance and to use this opportunity to further educate CF patients and caregivers.",

This is significantly improved from previous annual rates, which were: 68.1% in 2014, 65.6% in 2015, and 61.7% in 2016. Conclusions: Multifaceted interventions at our pediatric center resulted in an increased rate of screening for CFRD that is in accordance with the current guidelines. In an effort to continually improve patient care, further inventions will be made in order to hold these gains and continue to increase rates of CFRD screening. This is an ongoing QI project. Future implications will include interventions related to positive CFRD screening to improve overall CF patient care and outcomes. inpatient (49%) and median FEV1 predicted (80.7%) were lower compared to the national 82.2% and 92.9% respectively.",

Next steps in quality improvement (QI) will consist of continual work with the hospital staff to ensure timely delivery of treatment, patient education about hospital infection control measures and minimization of interruptions in school work. As per 2016 CFF Center specific report, our center showed increased duration of treatment completed in the hospital (76.2%) and improved FEV1% (95.7%) reflecting early stages of our QI initiatives.

Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA; 2. Medicine and Physiology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA Gastrointestinal (GI) problems are common in CF including constipation, meconium ileus, meconium plug syndrome and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. Lack of CFTR-mediated chloride secretion in the GI tract is thought to be the main cause for these problems. The prevalence of CF-associated constipation is very high and it is often refractory to dietary modifications and currently available laxatives. Here, we report a novel target for drug therapy of GI problems in CF -SLC26A3 (down-regulated in adenoma, DRA), a chloride/anion exchanger expressed in the luminal membrane of intestinal epithelial cells where it facilitates electroneutral NaCl absorption. SLC26A3 loss of function in humans and mice causes severe chloride-losing diarrhea. SLC26A3 inhibition is a unique and CFTR-independent approach to restore luminal chloride concentrations in CF GI tract. The objective of this study was to identify SLC26A3 inhibitors by high-throughput screening as novel tools for studying intestinal fluid absorption mechanisms and test their efficacy in a mouse model as first-in-class drug candidates for anti-absorptive therapy of constipation. A screen of 50,000 synthetic small molecules was done in FRT cells co-expressing murine SLC26A3 and a yellow fluorescent protein halide sensor, followed by structure-activity studies on analogs of active compounds. The 4,8-dimethylcoumarin DRA inh -A250 fully and reversibly inhibited SLC26A3-mediated chloride exchange with bicarbonate, iodide and thiocyanate with IC 50 down to 150 nM (see Figure) . DRA inh -A250 at 10 \u00b5M was selective for SLC26A3, as it did not inhibit the homologous anion exchangers SCL26A4 (pendrin), SLC26A6 (PAT-1) or SLC26A9, nor did it affect other chloride channels and intestinal ion transporters. In mice, intraluminal DRA inh -A250 fully blocked fluid absorption in closed distal colonic loops, and oral DRA inh -A250 prevented loperamide-induced reductions in stool weight, number of pellets and stool water content in wild-type and CF (\u0394F508 homozygous) mice. These studies support a major role of SLC26A3 in colonic fluid absorption and suggest the therapeutic utility of SLC26A3 inhibition in constipation and other hyposecretory GI disorders associated with CF.

Although tube feeding is often the only remaining way to restore nutritional status in CF patients, it leads to an increase in body fat. Different TF types as well as interventions combining activity to TF should be evaluated in the future. Background: Linear growth is a major determinant of vital capacity and FEV 1 . Adolescent and adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with CFTR-p.G551D have sustained increases in weight following ivacaftor treatment. A study of CF pigs and infants with CF showed CFTR could be directly involved in growth hormone signaling. Thus, CFTR modulators could enhance linear growth in children with CF. We hypothesized that children with CF would have increased height Z-scores after treatment with CFTR modulators.",

Diminished height Z-scores persisted throughout childhood and adolescence (Z=-0.30 \u00b1 0.12, p=0.014 at age 10). Parental height Z-scores were +0.31 for mothers and +0.29 for fathers, indicating that the children with CF did not achieve their linear growth potential. Adolescent females had disproportionate decreases in BMI and weight Z-scores with time. To examine the effect of CFTR modulators, we compared subjects receiving ivacaftor or ivacaftor-lumacaftor to age and sex-matched controls. Patients who received ivacaftor (N=8) had increasing height Z-scores compared to controls (N=16) before starting ivacaftor (+0.12 units/year for ivacaftor group vs. -0.14 units/year for control group, P < 0.001). This advantage was maintained after starting ivacaftor (+0.18 units/year for ivacaftor vs. +0.06 units/year for control, P =0.002). The ivacaftor-lumacaftor group (N=15) had similar height and weight compared to the matched control group (N=15) before therapy. After starting therapy, treated patients had greater increases in height Z-scores compared to matched controls (+0.025 units/ year for ivacaftor-lumacaftor vs. -0.065 units/year for control, P = 0.018) Conclusions: Children with CF have decreased height Z-scores from early childhood through adolescence and fail to reach their biological growth potential. Our findings in early childhood are similar to those reported in the BONUS study. Patients treated with ivacaftor and ivacaftor-lumacaftor had increased linear growth compared to age and sex-matched controls. However, patients prescribed ivacaftor had better growth than controls prior to starting therapy. Improvements in height could impact vital capacity and FEV 1 . 2 1. Department of Food and Nutrition, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA; 2. Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA Introduction: The association of body mass index (BMI) and pulmonary function is well described in the cystic fibrosis (CF) literature. Current recommendations from the CF Foundation suggest BMI goals of \u226522 kg/m 2 for females and \u226523 kg/m 2 for males. Obtaining and preparing food may be important life skills to help maintain weight and BMI in the optimal range. Our goal was to determine whether there is an association between these life skills and BMI.",

The worksheet examined multiple questions regarding self-care skills. This analysis will focus on one question of interest: \"Do you grocery shop and cook for yourself for most of your meals/food?\" Patients indicated their perceived ability to complete this skill on a Likert scale: I always do this (4), I am learning to do this (3), I don't know how to do this, but I want to learn (2), I don't know how to do this (1), I don't need to do this (0). For the purpose of this data analysis answers were categorized into two groups: \"yes\" which included those who selected 3 or 4 and \"no\" for those who selected 0, 1, or 2. The worksheet was administered June-August 2015 to patients ages 18-25 in the pediatric and adult centers. A Mann Whitney U was used to compare median [interquartile range] BMI between patients who answered yes (3 or 4) versus those who answered no (0-2).

This result highlights the importance of educating patients on basic life skills including grocery shopping and food preparation. Future educational interventions should focus on ensuring that patients feel comfortable performing these self-care skills which in turn could result in increased BMI values. Further analysis with larger sample sizes is necessary to determine the true association between self-care skills and BMI. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis is a systemic genetic disease characterized by chronic inflammation and micronutrient deficiencies. CF Foundation guidelines recommend annual assessment of liposoluble vitamin levels and provide guidance regarding supplementation. Iron deficiency has been described in multiple CF studies. However, few care centers assess iron status routinely and there is much controversy related to supplementation. Iron deficiency is difficult to assess in CF since iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and ferritin levels are affected by inflammation, and different deficiency cutoffs have been proposed for use in chronic inflammatory diseases. Moreover, while iron deficiency is associated with worsening lung disease, it is not well understood whether deficiency contributes to disease or is part of an adaptive protective mechanism to prevent pathogens from utilizing iron to harm the host. At our center, we perform a routine iron panel in clinic in stable patients annually for women and every 3 years for men. We conducted a single center retrospective analysis to identify prevalence of iron deficiency in our adult patient population.",

Prevalence rates were calculated using a variety of parameters to classify iron deficiency, including TSAT <20% and ferritin levels <30 ng/mL, <41 ng/mL, and <100 ng/mL. For statistical analyses, iron deficiency was determined if either TSAT <16% or ferritin <12 ng/mL. Patients whose iron panels were drawn during hospitalization or exacerbation were excluded from analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS to identify risk factors significantly associated with iron deficiency and to determine the correlations between biochemical markers of iron status.",

Gastroenterology & Nutrition, Nemours Children's Specialty Care, Jacksonville, FL, USA Background: Good nutritional status is associated with better outcomes in cystic fibrosis (CF). The combination of pancreatic insufficiency, frequent pulmonary exacerbations, and malnutrition make it challenging to obtain optimal nutritional status by oral intake alone. In some individuals, enteral tube feeds can help achieve improved nutritional status. As our CF center's median BMI is less than the national average, we decided to examine our process for recommending gastrostomy tubes (G-tube).",

However nutritional status was adequate in our cohort with a small number of at-risk patients identified. There were insufficient data to confidently be able to determine significant relationships between anthropometric outcomes and dietary intake. As a consequence we will review our nutritional screening protocols to determine the most effective and reliable method of collecting accurate dietary data in this population. This will assist us in providing meaningful dietary interventions to our at risk population. Introduction: Somatic growth in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is strongly associated with pulmonary and clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, achieving caloric intake sufficient for growth is often difficult. Attempts to improve dietary intake in CF, including behavioral interventions and liquid nutritional supplements, variably promote weight gain. Development of alternative, palatable, nutrient-dense sources of supplemental calories may benefit children with CF as it could plausibly improve their nutritional status and, secondarily, pulmonary outcomes. Ready-to-Use Supplemental Food (RUSF), composed of peanut butter paste, flour, milk powder, sugar and oil, is an inexpensive, palatable, energy-dense, and effective treatment of undernutrition in low and middle-income countries. We sought to develop a RUSF as a source of supplemental nutrition for children with cystic fibrosis and determine its palatability and tolerability.",

We then determined acceptability of the CF-RUSF through a two-week crossover acceptability study. Two randomly assigned cohorts were provided CF-RUSF for 1 week, after which they received the crossover lead candidate for 1 week. Families were instructed to provide CF-RUSF equivalent to approximately 20% of recommended caloric intake, but were allowed to present the CF-RUSF in the manner the child preferred (plain, on bread/toast, with fruit, etc).

This study has reinforced the importance of diet quality alongside quantity. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with impaired nutrient absorption in the setting of increased energy expenditure, and lower body mass index is associated with worse lung function. Parenteral nutrition (PN) may be a useful tool in optimizing nutritional status. While consensus recommendations exist to support the safe and effective use of parenteral nutrition in the general population, there is a paucity of high quality evidence to identify best practices in patients with cystic fibrosis. The objective of this study is to characterize the patterns, complications, and benefits of parenteral use in children and adolescents admitted to a single large CF center.",

Bronchopneumonia and/or malnutrition was documented in 68% of admission diagnoses with CF liver disease and/or CF-related diabetes in 40%.

Complications attributed to PN were documented in 72% of the episodes and included line infection, electrolyte abnormalities, elevated triglycerides, elevated BUN, and glycemic control issues. In 1 episode, PN temporarily discontinued due to a complication attributed to PN (line infection). Eighty percent of episodes with PN ended when adequate enteral intake resumed.

Univ. of Bonn, Bonn, NRW, Germany Background: Infants identified by neonatal screening programs as having cystic fibrosis (CF) need further evaluation to determine their pancreatic phenotype as those with fat malabsorption i.e. pancreatic insufficient (PI) require oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), whereas those with sufficient endogenous pancreatic enzyme secretion with normal fat absorption are pancreatic sufficient (PS) and PERT is unnecessary. The gold standard method for the indirect assessment of pancreatic function status in infants is a 72-hour faecal fat balance test. However, most centres globally refuse to do faecal fat balance tests for a variety of obvious reasons and are looking for possible alternatives. The 13 C mixed triglyceride (MTG) breath test has been proposed for the noninvasive assessment of fat digestion and absorption. Using mass spectroscopy (MS) to analyse samples this has proved a very sensitive but complex and expensive method. Nondispersive isotope selective infrared spectrometry (NDIRS) developed during the 1990s has been used as a potential substitute for the more expensive MS technique. However, using NDIRS technique in a group of 54 healthy infants of less than 5 months of age, we have found NDIRS technique to be too insensitive. Therefore we wanted to investigate whether with age increase in the first two years of life this test would improve and gain sensitivity.",

BACKGROUND: Due primarily to malabsorption, infants with CF have increased nutritional needs that may not be met by prolonged, exclusive breastfeeding. The Adequate Intake (AI) of linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is 4.4 and 0.5 g/day, respectively, based on an average intake of 780ml/day of breast milk in exclusively breastfed healthy infants, ages 2-6 mo. Factoring in 15% fat malabsorption, infants with CF who are exclusively breastfed would require 5.1 g/day of LA and 0.6 g/day of ALA to meet their needs.",

Of 183, 79 infants enrolled in FIRST after the BM ancillary study was initiated in 2015; 48 were breastfed and 29 mothers (60%) agreed to participate in the BM study. This analysis includes data from 70 food frequency questionnaires (reflecting maternal dietary intake) and 77 BM samples collected from 20 days to 6.9 mo postpartum from 23 mothers. For exclusively breastfed (exB) infants (n=7), LA and ALA intakes (g/day) were estimated based on LA and ALA concentration in their mothers' BM samples (16 samples) multiplied by 780 ml.

These findings are similar to dietary intakes reported from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). Caloric density of BM was as expected, 19.5\u00b13.6 kcal/oz (range: 12.3-31.6), but LA and ALA contents were low [LA: 4.0\u00b11.7 g, (61%<AI); ALA: 0.3\u00b10.2 g (87%<AI) per 780 ml]. LA in maternal diet and BM samples (expressed as % of total fat) were significantly correlated (r=0.42, p=0.004), but the correlation for ALA was not significant. LA intake in exB infants was lower (3.9\u00b11.9 g/day) compared to that in pB infants (5.5\u00b12.0 g/day), p=0.007. ALA intake in exB infants was also lower than that in pB infants (0.35\u00b10.21 versus 0.44\u00b10.18 g/day, respectively) but the difference was not significant, p=0.10. The prevalence of low LA intake was almost 2-fold high in exB infants (63%<AI) than that in pB infants (34%<AI), p=0.06. A similar trend was observed in ALA intake (exB: 88%<AI, pB: 66%<AI), p=0.18. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal LA and ALA intake were similar to women in NHANES but the majority of breast milk samples were low in LA and ALA. Supplemental formula intake reduced the prevalence of low dietary LA by about half and ALA by a quarter, and represents an effective strategy for improving essential fatty acid intake in breastfed infants with CF. Lung function decline is correlated strongly with nutritional status. CFTR modulator therapies are designed to correct the malfunctioning protein made by the CFTR gene. Currently, three CFTR modulators have been approved by the FDA: Kalydeco (ivacaftor), Orkambi (ivacaftor/lumacaftor), and Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor). Age and CFTR mutations limit patient eligibility for treatment with CFTR modulators. Studies have shown an improvement in nutritional status following treatment with ivacaftor or ivacaftor/lumacaftor.",

Due to the small sample size and retrospective nature of this review, a larger, multicenter study on CFTR modulators and the impact on nutrition outcomes and pancreatic function is necessary to further support these findings. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene leading to loss of functional anion channels. Low weight-for-age percentiles and body mass index of CF patients strongly correlate with lung function and survival. CF patients also exhibit elevated energy expenditure and preferential reliance on carbohydrates. Despite high-calorie high-fat diets coupled with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, CF patients struggle to maintain a healthy BMI. Studies also showed that CF adolescents with good lung function and nutritional status still manifest elevated energy expenditure and low exercise performance indicating intrinsic nature of energy inefficiency in CF. We and others demonstrated that CF mouse models display similar energy imbalance, including reduced energy intake and storage, and high energy expenditure, all contributing to reduced growth that is independent from apparent malnutrition, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and progressive lung disease. Our further investigations of metabolic alterations in CF mice revealed abnormally low fasting glucose levels and high ketone body levels possibly indicating difficulty of maintaining normoglycemia (e.g. inefficient gluconeogenesis) and high lipid oxidation. Akin to high-fat high energy diets prescribed to CF patients, CF mice had poor growth and fat accretion outcomes when fed high-fat diet.",

Subjects were provided a single dose during CF clinic. Safety was assessed with a serum calcium (Ca) level and a serum phosphorus (Phos) level measured at 1 week and 3 months following the dosage. If Ca or Phos were elevated, a parathyroid hormone level (PTH) and spot urine Ca to creatinine ratio was obtained.

Not only OAD was used as alternative treatment to insulin but more surprising also only dietary advice or even no CFRD related treatment was documented. CF registry data reports (eg 2015 Patient Registry-Annual Data Report from the CF Foundation) showed cross-sectional data including all CFRD patients with no specification of the duration of CFRD. Nevertheless even in this report only 77.6% of all CFRD patients were on chronic insulin treatment and 8% had no treatment at all. There is still room to improve CFRD treatment and it might be that the treatment burden of insulin is in part a reason for this low acceptance together with minimal clinical signs in the early stage of CFRD. It might be that OAD which were shown to be as safe and effective as insulin in the treatment of CFRD with a lower treatment burden compared to insulin are an alternative medical treatment at least for those who used no medical treatment for CFRD at all.

            "text": "Conclusions: Individuals with CF, glucose intolerance and a normal median BMI, exhibit LBM deficits that are masked by an increase in FM. Whether insulin therapy can prevent or reverse these LBM deficits requires further study. Diabetes is a frequent comorbidity of cystic fibrosis (CF), with ~80% of individuals carrying severe CFTR mutations developing diabetes by middle age. Although CF-related diabetes (CFRD) occurs primarily due to impaired insulin secretion, impaired secretion of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) occurs early prior to the onset of CFRD. PP is an understudied islet hormone and its role in glucose homeostasis remains largely enigmatic. Several studies suggest that PP is an intra-islet regulator of insulin secretion, and that its absence is associated with hepatic insulin resistance-which is known to occur in CF. We hypothesized reduced PP secretion may contribute to abnormal glucose levels in CF. Herein, we found that PP secretion was reduced during oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) and hypoglycemic glucose clamps in CF ferrets. Similarly, reduced PP secretion following OGTT was observed in young CF human subjects. Despite reduced PP secretion, CF ferrets and human pancreas retain immunoreactive PP cells. To evaluate the impact of PP on glucose metabolism, we ectopically expressed PP in wild-type (WT) ferret muscle using recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV). Mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTTs) at three weeks after AAV-PP infection demonstrated lower glucose and lower insulin, suggesting that PP enhances insulin sensitivity. Thus, we hypothesized that low PP levels in CF may decrease insulin sensitivity. Indeed, CF ferrets exhibited altered hepatic expression of genes related to insulin resistance/sensitivity and glucagon/fasting glucose metabolism regulation. PP knockout mice lack a glycemic phenotype. However, the mouse PP amino acid sequence differs significantly from human, whereas the ferret PP amino acid sequence is nearly identical to human. Therefore, we created a PP-KO ferret. PP-KO ferrets displayed fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, despite normal body weight. Following OGTT, PP-KO ferrets exhibited glucose intolerance. While loss of PP did not significantly affect insulin secretion, it markedly decreased glucagon secretion. Moreover, acute administration of PP to PP-KO ferrets before OGTT improved glucose tolerance and increased glucagon secretion, without alteration of insulin levels. We investigated the impact of PP supplementation on postprandial hyperglycemia during normal chow feeding in CF ferrets. Blood glucose was monitored immediately before and one hour after feeding. Intramuscular PP was administered for three days. CF ferrets showed normalization of postprandial glucose levels following PP supplementation, while there was no effect seen in controls. Glucose clamps of PP-KO and CF ferrets are ongoing to better understand the role of PP in regulating insulin action. Taken together, these results suggest that PP increases insulin sensitivity and that low PP levels may be involved in the pathogenesis of CFRD. Further studies on these models may provide new insights into mechanisms of PP action on glucose metabolism and the role of PP in the pathogenesis of CFRD. Objective: Recent retrospective reviews in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) have shown that severity of lung disease, poor nutritional status, and low vitamin D levels were associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD). There remains a gap in our understanding of bone disease in adult patients with CF, and the role of CF-related diabetes (CFRD) in bone health has not been well-studied. We hypothesized that lumbar spine BMD is associated with lung function and CFRD in an adult population with CF.",

This is supported by mouse studies showing high levels of neutrophil elastase in bone as well as reduced cortical perimeter. These data lay the foundation for considering therapies that may target the RANKL/OPG pathway as a treatment for CFBD in patients with CF. Rationale: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is a prevalent comorbidity that negatively impacts clinical outcomes including lung function, weight, and ultimately survival. Its impact on the health-related quality of life of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) has not been explored previously. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the quality of life of adults with CFRD and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) differs from individuals with normal glucose tolerance.",

Sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, and CFQ-R 14+ domain scores were compared between individuals with CFRD on insulin (n=28), CFRD not on insulin (n=26), impaired glucose tolerance (n=29), and normal glucose tolerance (n=63). Clinical variables were compared using ANOVA for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. CFQ-R domain scores were compared across groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multivariate linear regression was performed to examine the relationship between CFRD/IGT status (vs. normal glucose tolerance) and each of the twelve CFQ-R 14+ domains following adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and FEV 1 percent predicted (ppFEV 1 ).",

The Treatment Burden domain included the difficulty and time spent on treatment each day. None of the other CFQ-R domains differed significantly between the four categories. Following multivariable adjustment, the Treatment Burden domain score remained significantly lower for the CFRD on insulin group compared to the normal glucose tolerance group (adjusted \u03b2-coefficient -13.90; SE = 4.86; p<0.005) indicating greater treatment burden. The Treatment Burden domain score was not lower for CFRD not on insulin or IGT groups compared to the normal blood glucose tolerance group. CFRD on insulin also had lower Role Functioning and Digestion domain scores compared to normal glucose tolerance but these associations were not statistically significant.",

Future studies should focus on finding ways to ease the burden of blood glucose monitoring and to identify alternatives to insulin to decrease treatment burden and improve the quality of life of individuals with CF. Objective: CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is one of the most common complications in patients with CF. CFRD development is associated with worsening pulmonary function and general mortality. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of CFRD is the 2 hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), with annual testing recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Given the cumbersome nature of this test, simpler alternatives have been explored. The use of HbA1c in CFRD screening has been highly controversial with recent studies generating conflicting results. Interestingly, superior specificity was noted in studies examining more recent HbA1c data. Thus, we explore whether improvements in HbA1c test performance may influence the reliability of this marker in CFRD screening.",

Adult studies have shown that respiratory illness and inflammation, over time, negatively affects bone mineral density (BMD). There is limited and conflicting data about overall outcomes on BMD in pediatric CF (Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am. 2016; 45(2) :433). With extended life expectancy and increased emphasis on disease prevention for CF patients, pediatric CFBD is a topic that demands further investigation.",

We have increased our use of DEXA scans in detecting CFBD and have intervened with appropriate vitamin and mineral supplementation as well as physical therapy. By studying these patients, we can also better understand the effect of potential risk factors, such as pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition, respiratory status, medication use, and decreased physical activity. More focus should be placed upon prevention and management of pediatric CFBD including improved screening, appropriate nutritional and exercise interventions, and strategies early in life to prevent complications and to promote better health in adulthood. Background: Individuals with CF have a 35-50 percent chance of developing CFRD by adulthood. Nearly 10 percent of children with CF will have CFRD by age 10 years. The prevalence of CFRD increases with age and a delay in diagnosis leads to a negative impact on lung function, weight and survival. Additionally, recent studies suggest an association between INDET and poor pulmonary function, as well as high risk of developing CFRD. The 2-hour OGTT is the accepted standard for diagnosis of CFRD. However, performing annual OGTTs is labor intensive and inconvenient, leading to poor adherence and delayed diagnosis.",

In comparison to a time consuming and labor intensive OGTT, the use of a point-of-care screening hemoglobin A1C may allow for earlier detection and intervention of glycemic disturbance, resulting in better outcomes in the CF population. It has been established that the endocrine pancreas is affected in the CF patient. There is a correlation between glucose abnormalities, morbidity and mortality in CF patients (Ode KL, Moran A. Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2013; 1:52-8) . Glucose abnormalities include CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). CFRD is one complication in CF, occurring in more than 40% of adults and 25% of adolescents, which is preceded by episodes of IGT (Ntimbane T, et al. Clin Biochem Rev. 2009; 30:153-77; Schwarzenberg SJ, et al. Diabetes Care. 2007; 30:1056-61) . It is very well documented that reduced insulin secretion and insulin resistance (IR) lead to CFRD (Nathan BM, et al. Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes. 2010; 17:335-41; Preumont V, et al. Diabetes Care. 2007; 30:1187-92) . We have developed a CF rabbit that is more representative of human CF than any other CF animal model. No literature regarding CF-related diabetes in rabbits is available. For this purpose, we have developed 3 different mutations. For the first one we added one nucleotide (+1, caused frameshift at amino acid 479) or deleted one nucleotide (-1, caused frameshift at amino acid 478) which caused a frameshift in the CFTR at exon 1. Another mutation resulting in a deletion of 3 amino acids (from 477 to 479) is the -9 deletion or \u0394PSE-477-479. All these mutations affect the NBD1 of the CFTR channel. The mechanisms underlying CFRD are poorly understood. We have observed that CF rabbits have a tendency of low plasma insulin, which is an early sign of diabetes.",

            "text": "To study the impact of CFTR deficiency in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, wild-type (WT) and CFTR knockout rabbits were used to test glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and plasma insulin. Our results regarding the genotype +1/+1 showed that 80% of the CF rabbits showed impaired glucose tolerance. As for insulin, the CF rabbits had an insulin resistance which will explain the phenotype of impaired glucose. For the other CFTR mutation -1/+1 genotype, all the CF rabbits studied showed an abnormal glucose tolerance with 75% showing a severe impaired glucose. In addition, the insulin measurements showed less insulin production compared to WT after the injection of glucose. The lower insulin in the CF rabbits is compatible with an insulin insufficiency which will explain the delay in the glucose clearance. As for the -9/-9 genotype, 62% of the CF rabbits with -9/-9 genotype showed an impaired glucose clearance, with 38% showing the typical CFRD phenotype. The insulin measurements showed a normal insulin production compared to the WT which means, there is an insulin resistance in rabbits with abnormal glucose clearance. Taken all together, our CF rabbits with a frameshift mutation such as +1/+1 and -1/+1, are more susceptible to have CFRD than -9/-9 deletion of 3 amino acids. The data suggests that no expression of CFTR protein has a more dramatic effect on the uptake of the glucose than the expressed \u0394PSE-477-479 CFTR. Our CF rabbit is the perfect animal model to study the many problems associated with CF patients with CFRD including chronic pancreatic inflammation, dysfunction of the immune system, oxidative stress, and impaired insulin production and secretion.",

High estrogen levels are associated with increased inflammation in CF animal models of infection. We, therefore, sought to prospectively evaluate markers of inflammation and lung health in men and women with CF.

Levels of estradiol, progesterone and luteinizing hormone proved to be in expected ranges, marking points of menses, ovulation and luteal phase and effective contraception in the women. No adverse events were reported with use of OCP. Analysis of lung function showed no significant changes, however, CFQ-R respiratory scores were on average 9.2 points lower in women at ovulation relative to menses and improved 6.6 points once placed on OCP. In addition, interim analysis of inflammatory markers revealed increased levels of sputum white blood cells, percentage of neutrophils, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 in females at ovulation relative to menses which decreased on OCP. These markers were also higher in females at ovulation than in male controls. Further analysis of additional serum and sputum inflammatory markers and correlations between hormone levels and markers will be determined.",

These findings indicate that alcohol/opiate misuse is common and impacts both routine and inpatient care. Our review may underestimate prevalence, as we do not systematically screen for problematic substance use, and have included only those cases with clinically significant misuse clearly and verifiably documented in the EMR. Further research into the prevalence and effects of substance misuse in CF is indicated. Objectives: Adhering to the complex CF treatment regimen is challenging. Surprisingly, there are no standardized tools to identify adherence barriers. Using the newly created Barriers Assessment Screener (BAS; 21 items) we evaluated adherence barriers identified by people with CF treated in pediatric and adult CF centers to understand their perceptions of: (1) frequency (yes/no occurred in past 6 months) and (2) adherence interference (1=never to 5=always gets in the way of doing treatments) of common barriers.",

The role of the CF social worker at Cincinnati Children's has expanded to include transition coordination, mental health screening and referrals, and administration of the Psychosocial Assessment Tool-CF (PAT-CF), in addition to the daily expected responsibilities of a hospital social worker. Each of these roles demands the most up-to-date data entry and analysis to effectively use the information during clinical practice and previsit planning meetings. Manual entry, individual management of data, and data reporting places additional high demand on social workers and is not feasible given the multiple responsibilities for a full caseload. Automated data management and reporting is ideal to track psychosocial outcomes that social workers monitor clinically. These topics include mental health screening and intervention, adherence tracking, transition/educational objectives, and other general psychosocial services (eg, insurance, financial aid).",

The Psychosocial Report data is populated from the electronic medical record and external databases with most current data. The form includes patient demographics (including contact information), insurance carrier, and supplemental security income status. The report includes the last 3 mental health screen scores (GAD-7 and PHQ-9) and dates completed, with a color-coded, risk-stratified legend to define the scoring parameters. The PAT-CF score is also color-coded and stratified by risk, as well as transition/education assessments and parameters. Further information pulled into the report includes mental health diagnoses, date of the next psychology appointment, and date seen by the school liaison specialist. Finally, the most recent social work note and (if applicable), psychology instructions are automatically pulled into the report.",

Stratification is used to flag patients who are at high risk and discussions can occur to put resources in place to collaboratively address identified needs. The development of this report has elevated the importance of mental health and psychosocial information for all care team members so that this information can be easily pulled and discussed in real time in previsit planning meetings. Social workers are now able to significantly decrease time spent in preparation for previsit planning meetings and accurately report psychosocial factors impacting patient care, permitting more time for purposeful clinical interaction and resource identification. The nutritional demands of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are complex due to their difficulty absorbing nutrients and gaining weight. Body mass index (BMI) percentile is a critical factor in CF health outcomes, serving as a predictor of lung function and mortality across the lifespan. Guidelines recommend calorie intake between 110-200% of the daily energy needs for youth without CF, BMI at the 50th percentile or higher, 40% of calories from fat, 3 meals and 2-3 snacks per day, and use of enzymes for pancreatic insufficient patients. Almost half of youth with CF fall short of these nutritional health goals. Research using objective measures showed daily enzyme adherence among adolescents ranged from 42.5% to 77.1%. While nutritional adherence is multifactorial, one barrier yet to be examined among adolescents with CF is attempts to conceal CF diagnosis, symptoms, and treatments in order to appear \"normal.\" Attitudes toward disease disclosure develop within the family system, thus examining disease disclosure within the context of adolescent relationships and family attitudes about privacy and information sharing may shed light on the relation between disclosure and nutritional adherence. We hypothesized that better adolescent nutritional adherence behaviors would be predicted by families with more favorable attitudes towards sharing private information, better relationship quality with caregivers and friends, and more comfort in disease disclosure.",

However, teens with closer friendships eat less frequently and consume fewer calories, which suggests that these adolescents are spending more time with friends, leaving less time for self-management. Teens who reported lower levels of discord with their mother demonstrated better enzyme adherence, perhaps suggesting a developmentally appropriate shift of parent/adolescent independence without associated conflict. Higher caregiver privacy outside of the family predicted higher caloric intake and eating frequency, which could reflect developmentally appropriate ratio of monitoring and autonomy in these families. Findings from this sample suggest that daily structure and positive, appropriately supportive relationships are factors that can be targeted by clinicians and families. Introduction: Advances in the care and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) have led to improved mortality rates; therefore, considerably more patients with CF are living into adulthood. Among other treatments, medical nutrition therapy is required and research has found that social, behavioral, and physical factors influence the ability of CF patients to follow dietary recommendations. A socioeconomic factor that has not been adequately investigated with regards to dietary compliance of CF patients is food insecurity.",

The screening completion rate was higher when each parent that was individually approached by the psychologist agreed to complete the packet in session. Given that each parent screening required more intensive clinical time, fewer parents were able to be met with in clinic. Therefore the increase in the \"quality\" of screenings did adversely impact the \"quantity\" of individual parents approached for screening. These findings suggest the best approach for parent screenings should be a combination of our 2 trialed methods: a social worker to continue the discussion and provide parent info during annual review of patient, and a psychologist to continue to meet 1:1 with identified \"at-risk\" parents as this proved to be an effective strategy for parents needing more time.",

Michie and coworkers (Implement Sci. 2011; 6; 42) acknowledge that capability, opportunity and motivation are required to change adherence. Determining practical barriers and solutions in the home environment is an effective way of addressing \"opportunity to change\" and led to improved adherence in the short term in a significant number of patients. Where motivation is the main issue, an extended intervention to address willingness/readiness to change is necessary. Further evaluation is ongoing to assess the long-term impact of this focused adherence support at home. Methods: A multidisciplinary group at the University of North Carolina Adult CF Center completed a quality improvement project focusing on the implementation of outpatient ACP meetings as routine care for patients with CF. The target population was patients age \u226540 years or those with an FEV 1 of \u226440%, although patients who fell outside these parameters but expressed interest were eligible to participate. Patients were informed about the initiative via a quarterly newsletter and directly by the center's licensed clinical social workers (LCSW). An educational handbook was provided prior to the scheduled meeting. Patients were scheduled for a one-hour, billable ACP meeting with their CF provider, LCSW, dietitian, nurse coordinator, and designated support people. Effort was made to minimize interruptions by scheduling the meeting as the first or last visit of the day. Patients were invited to complete a survey using REDCap before and after their ACP meeting to assess their attitude toward end of life (EOL) care and ACP. Frequency of responses was tallied for each question.",

Objectives: CF management places significant burden on youth and their caregivers. Both are at risk for mental health concerns, such as anxiety/ depression, and families often face challenges in effectively communicating about CF-related issues. A diverse range of family psychosocial needs makes it difficult for care teams to identify the most pressing issues for patients; assessments that identify patient needs and priorities would be beneficial.

Families completed the CF-PNI with a psychology practicum student during a routine clinic visit. In the interview, families described the most significant challenges they encountered when managing CF, as well as the frequency and intensity of psychosocial stressors related to 3 domains of daily life (Treatment Adherence, Mental Health, Communication about CF). Family perceived level of need for psychosocial support in each domain was scored on a 5-point Likert scale; higher scores indicated greater need for support. Caregivers also completed scales evaluating treatment adherence (CF Treatment Adherence Rating Scale; CF-TARS), perceptions of patient quality of life (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised; CFQ-R), patient behavior (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; SDQ), and family functioning (Family Assessment Device-General Functioning; FAD-GF). Patient lung function (% predicted FEV 1 [FEV 1pp ]) and body mass index (BMI) were also collected. Convergent validity was established with bivariate correlations between interview scores, parent rating scales, and health outcomes. Conclusions: The CF-PNI appears to be a feasible semi-structured interview for evaluating the psychosocial needs of patients with CF and their families. Despite the lack of a significant association between Treatment Adherence need scores and the subjective CF-TARS measure, needs scores from the interview demonstrated evidence for convergent validity across all three domains. Future work should further evaluate the psychometric properties of the CF-PNI, such as replication of current findings in a larger sample and evaluation of the stability of CF-PNI need scores over time.",

Future research is needed to better understand the mechanism by which treatment burden and heath perceptions may be associated with lung function beyond the influence of psychological functioning. The CF Inpatient Child Life (CL) team recognized that patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have many obstacles that prevent them from maintaining and engaging in interactions with peers, family, and community while hospitalized. Patients are restricted from socialization with peers or participating in developmentally appropriate group activities due to standard infection prevention and control practices. Socialization is a key component of mental and overall health.

The providers worked together to develop a triage process for meeting the mental and behavioral health needs of patients and their caregivers. The social worker provides psychosocial education at every clinic visit and administers annual mental health screenings to patients and caregivers. Individuals with elevated screens are referred to the psychologist in order to receive immediate interventions. Individuals are able to receive 3 therapy sessions from the psychologist free of charge. If individuals need additional support beyond the initial sessions, the social worker assists with locating providers in close proximity to his/her home or the individual has the option to continue billable services with the CF psychologist. In order to support the individual's needs in his/her community, the social worker has begun to develop a mental health network based on the counties of residence for the entire CF clinic's patient panel. A provider survey has been developed and contact information for providers is continually being gathered. The survey also gathers information on the provider's interest in obtaining additional information about CF.",

The PS provider also routinely assessed general emotional well-being, treatment regimen adherence, diet and sleep patterns, academic and social functioning, and status of and reliance on support system. Parents of younger patients were also asked to complete a short version of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC). During the visit, these screening measures were reviewed and discussed. When patients or their families identified problem areas in session, brief cognitive-behavioral interventions, psychoeducation, and outpatient PS referrals were provided. If patients screened negative, reassessment was recommended twice a year. If patients screened positive, reassessment was recommended at the following visit.",

            "text": "Results/Discussion: Over the first year, approximately 280 PS visits occurred as a component of patients' care during CF clinic follow-up visits. These visits occurred during 55 separate clinic sessions, with the PS team averaging 5 visits per clinic. A significant barrier to treatment, discovered soon after implementation, was the impact of poor health insurance coverage for mental health care. On multiple occasions, families ultimately opted out of future PS visits because of the additional provider copay required by insurance. Very few patients declined to see a PS provider based solely on fact they were not interested in PS support, which is optimistically indicative of movement away from the stigma associated with mental health issues preventing needed care. A second barrier was the extreme paucity of qualified PS providers across Oklahoma. Often, a family would be open to assistance to address an identified PS issue, but the challenge was finding a qualified provider covered under the patient's insurance plan. In summation, the primary barriers to care during the first year of implementation were additional cost burdens on families that already oftentimes had significant medical expenses and a limited referral base of qualified PS providers. To address these two issues moving into the second year of implementation, the PS team plans to use psychologists-in-training more strategically to provide supervised psychology services when families' insurance coverage for licensed PS provider visits is poor/cost prohibitive. The PS team is also working on the development of a seminar-based training program to better equip and build the referral base of local providers that can confidently and competently provide outpatient mental health services to Oklahoma's CF population. to infection control guidelines. To better support our patient population, an online support group was created to provide a space for CF patients to gain support and address feelings of isolation.",

Patients with high social complexity are a high-risk group where efforts to develop interventions throughout childhood and adolescence may mitigate potentially preventable health care use and improve future outcomes.

Use of this assessment also provides opportunities to connect patients to mental health services earlier if needed. Introduction: Given the improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and the increasing number of CF living into adulthood (Elborn SJ, et al. Eur Respir J. 2016; 47:420-8) , a need to focus on the self-management and health care transition from paediatric to adult health care has become paramount. Although in most Italian systems there has been ongoing centralised CF care with combined paediatric and adult services, projects to create independent adult CF centres are increasing. Thus, it is important to develop and implement the knowledge about readiness to transition and patients' functional and psychological status. In addition, we know that anxiety and depression symptoms have been associated with worse health outcomes (Goldbeck L, et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014; 6:CD003148) . To date, the relationship between self-reported health care transition readiness tools and psychological symptoms of Italian CF patients has never been systematically explored. This study investigates the relationship between transition readiness and patients' functional and psychological status in adult CF patients which are followed in a pediatric center.",

The concerning rates of depression and anxiety in patients and caregivers contributed to the International Committee on Mental Health in CF developing a consensus statement for screening and treating depression and anxiety. In this statement, clinic-based screening for depression and anxiety for patients and caregivers was outlined using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The CF Center at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (Lurie Children's) started screening in patients in 2014 and incorporated caregiver screening in 2016.

They also value the long-term nature of these relationships. Although providers reportedly adopted a partnership framework, their exemplar stories across disciplines included strategies that were sometimes discrepant with their philosophical descriptions of partnership and were more aligned with an \"adherence\" or \"compliance\" framework that involved persuading patients to follow-through with \"what she [patient] should be doing.\" Parents consistently described partnership as parents and providers \"working together\" in the best interests of the child/patient in which each member contributes parallel and complementary expertise. Parents described how their unique vantage points of time with and proximity to their children allows for observations of subtle changes or idiosyncrasies that confer an understanding of their child's psychosocial, developmental, and health needs. Parents used these parental understandings to advocate for their children's evolving health care needs while maintaining a \"normal\" life. While providers tended to focus on the child's physical needs, parents offered more holistic perspectives about the child and family life.

However, the early mortality, constant hospitalization, and time commitment to managing CF directly contribute to poor mental health in these patients. Mental health issues such as increased risk of anxiety and depression have become a forefront topic in the CF community, including how to identify and treat these conditions. Depression and anxiety can have adverse effects on CF patients in that they are less likely to be compliant with treatment, have worse lung function, and have increased number of hospital visits. The goal of this study was to determine whether CF mouse models exhibit the phenotypes of anxiety and depression and to explore potential mechanisms. We have shown that slower microtubule reformation rates as well as decreased acetylated microtubule levels are seen in CF tissues and hypothesize that these microtubule alterations contribute to behavior changes.",

Hdac6 depletion reverses the depression phenotype, but not anxiety related behavior, suggesting the two phenotypes are regulated by separate mechanisms. Hdac6 depletion fixing post-pubertal depression is consistent with our previous work showing that Hdac6 knockout restores post-pubertal growth in CF mice and points to Hdac6 regulating a neurological developmental process in CF. Acknowledgment: Supported by a grant from the CFF. The age of rapid development of CFTR modulator therapy has brought new hope and promise for improved quality of life and longevity for individuals with cystic fibrosis. The approved CFTR modulator therapies have differing efficacies and are indicated for select populations of patients. The long-term trajectory of lung function stability and potential increased life span for any of these individuals can be speculated but is still largely unknown. Thanks to persistent advancement of maintence therapies and implementation of best practice, even prior to the advent of CFTR modulator therapy, the age of survival of individuals with CF has been on the rise. Despite improvements in pulmonary health for individuals with CF, it remains a chronic illness with a heavy disease burden. Increased rates of anxiety and depression are found in individuals with cystic fibrosis (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2014; 69:1090-7) . Some CFTR modulator therapies have known medication interactions resulting in decreased efficacy of SSRIs. The complex overlay of promising new therapies, high rates of depression, and many individuals still left without CFTR modulator therapy brings to question what impact CFTR modulator therapy has had on mental health over the last 5 years. The Cystic Fibrosis Center Western New York has been uniformly screening individuals with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and up for the last 5 years. We aim to analyze our existing data to identify trends of mental health change that have been found in relation to the availability and prescription of CFTR modulator therapy. These factors combined likely have a significant impact on mental health and outlook on life for individuals with CF and may be helpful for the CF care team to provide optimal mental health monitoring and treatment.",

MI is a collaborative, nonjudgmental, patient-directed and goal-oriented approach that is especially effective with patients who are ambivalent or resistant to changing their behaviors. Instead of relying on traditional information delivery models, MI focuses on eliciting the patient to discuss his or her own motivations for change and ability to make such changes. MI has been successfully used to improve patient treatment adherence and positive health behaviors with a wide range of illness populations, including cystic fibrosis (CF).

Trainings were 30 minutes in length and occurred at the beginning of each biweekly CF mental health team meeting. The trainings focused on CF-specific issues including pain management, coping with medical trauma and procedural anxiety, body image, mindfulness, and complementary medicine. The trainings also focused on using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and other evidence-based treatment modalities with the CF population. The team's social workers were surveyed about what topics they were interested in, and surveyed following each presentation to give feedback and inform future training topics. To assess the practical application of these trainings, we will perform retrospective chart review from September 2017-November 2017 on all patients with CF >12 years old who had a mental health assessment by a social worker in the ambulatory clinic. Social workers were asked at the time of each screening to chart which interventions they used with each patient in clinic.",

The five-year prevalence of depression (2013-2017) was 29% and highest among individuals aged 18-25 (19% of individuals aged 12-17; 39% of those 18-25; 32% of those 26-49; and 18% of those 50 and older) and among females (33%) compared to males (26%). The 5-year prevalence of suicidal ideation was 12%. Difficulties with energy, sleep, and feeling sad, depressed, or hopeless were the most common symptoms reported by individuals with CF and depression. With stepped care treatment 38% of individuals with depression had a clinical recovery (PHQ-9 score< 5) at 3 months, 14% at 6 months, 11% at 9 months and 3% by one year (10% are still actively receiving stepped care treatment). We found the course of depression was chronic in the remaining 24% of our population who experienced persistent (symptoms for \u2265 two years in adults and \u2265 1 year adolescents), unremitting depression. The likelihood of depression recurrence was only 8% over the 5-year study time.",

These same questions are asked separately for each of 12 different treatment components (e.g., airway clearance, inhaled antibiotics, dietary supplements). The second section involves questions regarding the patient's approach to volitional or purposeful changes to his or her overall CF care regimen. Content validation of the CF-CBS is being conducted as one-key component of a broader multisite, pilot and feasibility trial to test telecoaching as an adherence promotion intervention. The validation sample will consist of about 40 patients (ages 14-25) and approximately 20-25 parents of adolescent patients. Patients and parents individually complete the CF-CBS at study enrollment, followed by an individualized, cognitive debriefing interview utilizing a standard interview guide with prompts. All cognitive debriefing interviews are audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by a paid third-party service. Cognitive debriefing interview transcripts are divided equally among three coders, with 30% of interviews independently coded by two coders to assess reliability. Transcripts will be coded for consistency in participant interpretation of survey items and need for clarification in item content. Discrepancies will be discussed and resolved with the study principal investigators. The CF-CBS measure will be revised based on aggregated results and feedback.",

Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN, USA Background: Previous studies have shown that there is a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in caregivers of children with chronic disease, and that this significantly impacts their children's mental health and long-term outcomes. Research has also shown the importance of breaking bad news to caregivers, and how this alone can impact caregiver's perceptions of their child's diagnosis, quality of life and life expectancy. There are limited data on the mental health of parents of infants diagnosed with CF through newborn screening (NBS). The goals of this study are to determine the prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs) in parents at our CF center and identify factors associated with the presence and severity of these mental health diagnoses.",

Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA Background: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are exposed to painful and anxiety-producing procedures during routine outpatient care, such as quarterly deep oropharyngeal (OP) cultures. Child life specialists (CLS) are trained to recognize developmental concerns in the context of health care and to intervene using developmentally appropriate play, rehearsing coping skills and offering psychological preparation to ameliorate anxiety and distress. With the addition of a CLS at one CF clinic per week, we designed and implemented a pilot study to evaluate the effect of child life intervention on behavioral distress and self-reported pain for children with CF undergoing clinical OP culture. We hypothesized that repeated exposure to CLS intervention would decrease the child's observed behavioral distress and self-reported pain and decrease parental anxiety relative to the procedure over time.",

At each study visit, a trained observer rated the child's behavioral distress during the OP swab procedure using the Procedure Behavior Checklist (PBCL). Immediately following the OP swab, the FACES scale was administered to measure the child's experience of pain. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure parental anxiety.

The longitudinal nature of the study resulted in variability in the intervention group; 10 of 17 participants had an intervening CF clinic visit without CLS present. A mixed intervention group was created for analysis to differentiate these participants from the pure intervention group, resulting in small group sample sizes for analysis. Length of time between study visits ranged from 42-287 days. Other potential contributing factors include multiple nurses performing the OP swabs, turnover in PBCL scorers, and other procedures/confounding events occurring at a clinic visit. Subjectively, parents endorse CLS services in clinic, although these opinions were not measured. Larger studies with CLS na\u00efve patients and more control over potentially confounding factors are needed to assess the effect of CLS intervention in outpatient clinics. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) management has been largely based on an integrated, collaborative team approach with airway clearance, antibiotic regimens for respiratory infections, inflammatory modulation and nutritional management (Zemanick ET, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2010; 9:1-16) . Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators such as ivacaftor (Kalydeco), ivacaftor/lumacaftor (Orkambi), and more recently tezacaftor/ivacaftor (Symdeko) have changed the way in which CF management has been approached, with more targeted treatments at the protein level based on CF mutations. The decision to start one of these medications is multifactorial and involves many stakeholders. Caregivers and patients may consider side effects, including possible unknown long term effects, expectation of clinical benefit, prior experience with similar medicines, social media or other influences (Singer E, et al. Health Expect. 2011; 17:4-14) . Patient choice on medications may also be influenced by how the information is presented by the CF provider (Fraenkel L, et al. Med Decis Making. 2016; 37:230-8) . In light of the changing landscape of CF medical management, this study aims to better understand the decision making process including the influence of social media on individuals and caregivers of those with CF who are eligible for CFTR modulators, as well as to discern if the way providers present the information is consistent.",

Parents reported that the most challenging parts of their child's medical routine were airway clearance (n= 14), getting enough calories (n= 13), and medical procedures (n=11). They reported that what makes it challenging for their child to do CF care is the child not liking the way the treatment feels (n= 10), the child having a high activity level/ being distractible (n= 9), and the child not wanting to appear different (n= 9). The most commonly endorsed barriers to adherence were finding time to do treatments (n= 15) and forgetting to do treatments (n= 6).

            "text": "Conclusion: Parents of young children with CF report that three areas are the most challenging parts of their children's medical routines: airway clearance, getting enough calories, and medical procedures (e.g. blood draws). Parents were interested in learning more about how to manage these challenges through written materials and workshops. As future directions, we are developing an interview assessment tool for use with parents, and developing parent education handouts on each of the three challenging areas. We plan to implement the following as a standard of care for children who have recently turned 3 years old: assessment of adherence challenges, discussion of relevant handouts, and making psychology referrals if needed. (2):263-83). To improve education, a children's story was written about a child with CF experiencing hospitalization who learns about the cause of CF and the importance of self-care behaviors such as treatment adherence. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of an educational book tailored to the developmental level of preschool and young school age children (ages 4-10 years) with CF. Endpoints were measured by children's knowledge gained (pre-/post-intervention test) and parent questionnaire to determine feasibility, usefulness, and perceived satisfaction. A pre-/post-test randomized controlled trial design was utilized with 40 children with CF between ages 4-10 years and their parent (child-parent dyad), admitted to the hospital or seen in the outpatient CF clinic. The test group received the CF book (Breathing Better: Peter's Trip to the Hospital) and the control group received a generic children's book (Going to the Hospital). The evidence-based knowledge pre-/post-test is an 11 multiple choice questionnaire developed by a nurse clinician, a Child Life Specialist, and a nurse researcher. Procedures consisted of study staff completing the pretest with the child, demonstrating reading of the book, and requesting parents to read the assigned book at least once per day for 3 days. Follow-up included completion of the post-test questionnaire with the child and parent. Analysis of descriptive statistics for demographics and parent questionnaire, chi square for group comparison, and t-test for pre-/post-test comparison were completed. A total of 40 children with CF (53% male; mean age 7.05 years; median 7 years) along with their parent dyad completed the study with 20 in each group. Demographic comparison between the groups were similar. Preliminary comparisons of pre-/post-test mean scores between the groups were non-significant. The level of difficulty per item for post-test intervention group were moderate (6 out of the 11 items were scored correct by 70% or less of the respondents). However, parents with the CF book reported their child enjoyed the book (100%), had improved understanding of the disease (90%), learned something he/she did not previously know about CF (child 90%; parent 45%), increased discussion about CF between child and parent (90%), and would recommend the book to other parents of children with CF (100%). Findings from this study have led to revision of the pre-/post-test questions. Additional enrollment will be requested to re-evaluate knowledge assessment. Although knowledge assessment was insignificant, the usefulness and feasibility of the book were positive. With diagnosis and coping education at the core of Nursing and Child Life roles, this CF-specific children's book met the study's secondary aim of being useful to child-parent dyads enrolled in the study.",

Average age of participants who learned from parents was 5 years earlier than those who learned from a HCP. Emotional responses did not differ significantly based on who facilitated the discussion. Further, these data suggest a preference for learning about reproductive impact of CF and ART options by age 16, which should be further explored and confirmed. These findings provide insight to the range of emotions and questions that men experience when learning about CF-related male infertility. Upon learning this, many have questions regarding their ability to have children. As one man conveyed in an openended response, boys with CF should learn in \"early adolescence, so that he has plenty of opportunities to ask pertinent questions as they arise or become relevant in his life. Background: Parents often struggle with how to motivate their children to complete treatments and to become more independent with treatments as they get older. Treatment adherence is extremely important for overall functioning and health, but can also be a significant source of conflict between parents and children with CF. Frequently, parents tire of \"nagging\" their children to do their treatments and children feel annoyed and may rebel against treatments. A promising approach to improving treatment adherence and parent-child conflict is the adapted use of motivational interviewing (MI). MI is a style of communication designed to facilitate behavior change. Health providers commonly use MI to improve treatment adherence in adolescents with chronic illnesses; however, this approach has not yet been studied as a skill for parents to use. We examined whether basic MI skills could be taught to parents of children with CF. MI skills were incorporated into education on developmentally appropriate parenting strategies for children and adolescents with CF. Methods: We piloted several different methods for educating parents on MI skills. We first offered a one-time in-person and web-streamed session on MI during a parent education night (N=6). A separate 3-session telehealth group was piloted with a small number of parents who expressed interest in developing MI skills (N=4). To participate in training sessions, the parent had to have a child with CF (aged 8-18 years) and have expressed concerns with treatment adherence. Additionally, we developed a one page introductory handout on MI to distribute to parents during clinic visits.",

Support from peers who have experienced or are experiencing similar challenges can be especially meaningful during times of transition, such as adjusting to a new CF diagnosis, entering adulthood, making career decisions, or considering transplant. Members of the CF community have expressed a sense of isolation and desire for connection with peers.

Introduction: Michigan Medicine has a large Adult CF Center with over 300 patients. Nurses have historically filled the role as a center coordinator, which was true for our center as well. With a growing center and high work volume, our center explored the cost of adding another coordinator at the center. The cost of adding an additional RN was not feasible. After much discussion, our center decided to offer the position to our clinical social worker, who would work part time in clinic providing direct patient care and part-time as the center coordinator. The addition of social work to the coordinator role adds a multidisciplinary approach to the role.",

We meet formally once per week to have a check-in on projects we are working on and to reassess the needs of the center. Informally, we are in almost daily communication so we are cognizant of what is happening at our center.

Working as a team allows us to look at situations with different views to provide more diversified perspective. Splitting the role provided the RN more time engaging in clinical activities with patients. The social worker receives direct feedback during patients' annual assessments which allows coordinators to utilize this feedback to improve processes throughout the clinic. Projects we have worked on since we became center coordinator and RN coordinator include: development of a Patient Advisory Board, weekly inpatient rounds, and weekly team huddle with all members of the outpatient care team. Additionally, we implemented a transplant task force to evaluate and provide recommendations on our current transplant referral process. We have worked closely on organizing center data, such as genotypes and sweat tests, where previously there had not been time allotted for projects like this. Standardization has allowed us time to focus on projects to improve our patients' satisfaction, and process improvement. The processes we are implementing at our center will provide future coordinators structure with the role. The one challenge we face is that our offices are not physically in the same location, but this can be explored in the future.",

CF care is provided on a specialized medical surgical unit at SJH, and practices on this unit can differ widely from others at the same hospital. Care is coordinated with the outpatient clinic at National Jewish Health. NJH is the largest adult CF care and research center in the US, with around 500 patients. All NJH adult CF patients needing inpatient care are admitted to SJH Medicine North, a 24-bed unit. The average length of CF admission is 13 days. The average daily CF census is 17 patients and projected to grow, requiring a move to a larger, 30-bed unit in 2018. The interdisciplinary team includes NJH pulmonologists, hospitalists, endocrinology, ENT, pharmacy, nursing, RT, PT, dietitian, behavioral health, and case management.

All centers reported sleep issues important in care of patients regardless of age group, size of center (38.2 % agreed, 52.9% strongly agreed). Comments: patients underreport sleep issues, behavioral therapy access is limited. Testing: All responded agreed (33.8%), strongly agreed (54.4%) they are comfortable ordering sleep tests. Request: referral guidelines for age/symptoms/FEV1 to prompt testing. Sleep referral common practice overall (32.4% agreed or 44.1% strongly agreed). Convenient referral process: agreement (39.7%) or strong agreement (40.9%). Some reported limited to very limited access to testing. Sleep equipment: Utility of testing for NIPPV/Bilevel/O2 strongly agree for pediatric centers (60%) vs. adult (33.3%) or all age centers (33%).

Further studies must be performed to assess whether retention of knowledge is sustained and whether genetic knowledge is associated with reproductive perceptions. The CF Foundation (CFF) provides clinical guidelines to inform and improve CF care delivery. Guidelines may be evidencebased (developed from a systematic review of the best available evidence) or consensus-based (developed primarily from the opinions and experience of experts). Prior research has suggested that many CF patients are not receiving guideline-recommended care. The CFF Guideline Steering Committee (GSC) thus conducted a survey designed to examine how CF centers learn about these guidelines, challenges to their implementation, and if implementation differs by type of center (adult, pediatric, or affiliate).",

Hemoptysis is the coughing up of blood. Many factors (diabetes, S. Aureus) can contribute to hemoptysis. It is thought that chronic infection and inflammation in the airway is the cause of the bleeding with the majority of the blood coming from the bronchial artery (1) . CF patients (pt) report the occurrence of hemoptysis. Pts struggle with describing the amount of hemoptysis and fail to notify the clinic. Our center created a structured educational tool to help CF pts better identify the amount of blood they cough up. The aim of the project is to educate the pts on when to notify the staff and better describe the amount of hemoptysis they experienced. The study investigated the effect of the hemoptysis educational tool in CF adult pts. We educated pts in clinic about hemoptysis, amounts that should be reported and when they should inform the clinic. Participants included CF patients who had appointments in April, 2018 at CF Center, Keck Hospital of USC. Pts were given a pre-test, a hemoptysis handout (2) , visual aids and a post-test. The pre-test examined their hemoptysis knowledge. The handout was an informational sheet detailing a description of hemoptysis, symptoms, treatments and visual representation of when to call the clinic if hemoptysis occurs. Study staff reviewed the handout with visual aids that represented different common household items to describe the amounts of hemoptysis. Pts completed the post-test to establish what they learned. Data were collected: pts' demographics, PFT, pre/post-test questionnaire. The pre-test assessed if pt coughed up blood, how often and when, does the pt know when to call the CF clinic if and when they have hemoptysis, and if they know what hemoptysis is. The post-test included the evaluation of the educational tools. 36 pts were educated on the hemoptysis project. Average age (years) was 32.7\u00b18.3. 53% Male; 47% Female. Average FEV1 (liters) measured for PFT was 2.47\u00b11.03. Average of FEV1 was 69%. Based on the pre-test, majority of pts (78%) reported coughing up blood. More than half of pts (53%) were aware of what hemoptysis is. 61% of pts did know when to call the CF clinic when experiencing hemoptysis and 39% did not know when to call. After being educated, 89% pts were aware of what hemoptysis is. 81% pts now knew when to call the clinic when experiencing hemoptysis. Post-test surveyed pts on the helpfulness of the educational tools. 100% of pts found the handout, visual aids or both tools were helpful. Hemoptysis is a medical condition that happens to CF pts. It is important to assess how well pts are informed about hemoptysis. Our findings suggest that pts have coughed up blood and need to understand the importance of this medical condition. There is significant evidence of pts encountering hemoptysis. Findings determine that the educational tools made an impact on pts' knowledge. Overall, the educational study was evaluated on the basis of how well patients became informed and aware about hemoptysis in order to call the clinic and accurately describe the hemoptysis episode. Over the past several decades, life expectancy for patients living with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States has increased to an average of 43 years, with many patients exceeding that life expectancy by significant margins (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry. 2017 Annual Data Report. Bethesda, MD). Due to this increased longevity, patients who were previously limited to the pediatric world are now living long enough to transition to adult providers. The transition from pediatric to adult care is a growing topic of interest, and requires significant adjustment for both patients and providers. As a part of this transition, patients with cystic fibrosis are admitted to Internal Medicine wards for exacerbation therapy, which can result in inpatient hospital stays of several weeks.",

University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA Background: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is one of the most common comorbidities associated with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and affects approximately 20% of adolescents and 40-50% of adults. CFRD shares features of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but is a unique disease. Over time, thick mucus around the pancreas results in scarring and ultimately leads to decreased insulin production. Additionally, many individuals with CF have a component of insulin resistance. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the gold standard for diagnosis of CFRD and should be conducted annually starting at age 10 years. Based on low rates of adherence with annual screening at our CF center, we designed a two phase quality improvement effort. Phase 1 consisted of updating the order capabilities for OGTT in the electronic medical record (EMR) to streamline provider ordering and improve clarity of instructions to laboratory staff. Phase 2 consisted of a patient education effort, utilizing materials designed by a multidisciplinary group with endocrinology representation.",

Another limitation to the current data is incomplete data collection from phase 1 (scheduled to end July 2018). Despite these limitations, the trend towards increased adherence in adults is encouraging and our findings further demonstrate the need for phase 2 of targeted education.

A platform of Integrative Health and Physical Performance Coaching offered clients the opportunity to set personal health goals, develop implementation plans, establish habits, and overcome inevitable setbacks to achieve their health goals. This was achieved through a virtual community, providing accountability and the community to support each other to integrate positive change. Each client was offered a ninety-minute consult with the Integrative Health Coach (IHC). The IHC discussed the parameters of the program, vision work, create an outline of the client's goals for the program, and the group coaching and counseling. A 90-minute consult followed with the performance coach conducting a movement assessment screen and establishing fitness goals. The performance coach created a strength, conditioning, and movement program for the client. The clients have unlimited access to the IHC to maintain motivation, employ mindfulness techniques, and work toward their ultimate health goals. The client had the opportunity to engage in video conferences with the performance coach to teach proper exercise technique, and address any difficulties that the client is having with the exercise program.",

Per-patient expenditures for Medicaid-insured patients with CF increased considerably during 2010-2016; specialty drugs were largely responsible for this increase. The new, genotype-targeted CFTR modulators contributed to the increase in Medicaid expenditures, although the frequency with which prescriptions for ivacaftor and lumacaftor-ivacaftor were reimbursed remained low in comparison with CF patient registry data as well as data on privately insured patients with CF. It is not known how many of the patients in the Medicaid sample had dual coverage with private insurance and whether they had prescriptions for CFTR modulators reimbursed by those private plans. It is important for further research using other data sources, i.e., patient registry data, to ascertain whether there is indeed lower use of CFTR modulators by Medicaid-insured patients and, if that is the case, to identify potential barriers to access for that population. Finally, economic evaluations of CF therapies should use up-to-date estimates of healthcare costs that reflect current clinical practice. Methods: This study was conducted using insurance claims data from Inovalon's Medical Outcomes Research for Effectiveness and Economics Registry (MORE2 Registry\u00ae). Data were evaluated for each year from 2009 to 2015. Individuals were included in the study if they had at least two claims with CF listed as a diagnosis more than 30 days apart with at least one claim for a CF-specific medication or if they had previously been matched to the CFF Patient Registry. Individuals also had to be continuously enrolled for at least one calendar year. Utilization was categorized by inpatient, emergency department, outpatient, professional services, medications, and other. Utilization was stratified by age, sex, race, payer type, class of medications, transplant status, and diagnosis of CF-related diabetes or depression.",

Of the 1,923 individuals studied in 2015, the mean age was 19 years, 52% were male, and 71% had Managed Medicaid. Of note, the percent of individuals with Managed Medicaid was much higher in 2015 than prior years, suggesting an increase in Inovalon's Medicaid managed care member population, not the CF population itself. In 2015, 32% of studied individuals had at least one inpatient hospitalization, and among them there was an average of two hospitalizations with an average total length of stay of 18 days. In addition, 36% had at least one emergency department visit. Among those with at least one visit, there was an average of two visits to the emergency department. Almost all individuals had at least one outpatient visit (93%) with an average of nine visits. Within the population, 4% of individuals had prescription claims for ivacaftor, 15% for lumacaftor/ivacaftor, 73% for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, 73% for mucolytics, 41% for inhaled antibiotics and 71% for other antibiotics. The hospitalization rates of Medicaid and privately-insured individuals were similar, but the average length of stay for hospitalized Medicaid patients was 1.5 times that of the commercial patients. Individuals with Medicaid had a higher prevalence of emergency department visits and equal numbers of outpatient visits. All comorbidities examined were associated with greater utilization, but the most substantial difference was seen with depression. Those with depression were 2.3 times more likely to have had at least one hospitalization and, among those hospitalized, had more than double the length of stay compared to those who are not depressed.",

CFTR sequencing availability has increased the number of adult diagnoses, often with residual function mutations. Drug coverage is particularly challenging for adult CF patients with Medicare through disability or age \u226565 years.

Introduction: As the cystic fibrosis (CF) population increases and treatments escalate in complexity, costs related to CF care are expected to rise and could put tremendous strain on health care systems. CF health care costs have been explored in several countries. A recent scoping review identified 28 studies that reported overall CF health care costs; interestingly cost drivers varied across studies, with hospitalizations accounting for the majority of cost in some and pharmaceuticals dominating in others (Hollin H, et al. Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2016; 14:151) . However, there are no Canadian studies of national CF health care costs or hospitalization costs. The aim of this study was to examine the hospitalization costs of CF patients in Canada.",

Interestingly, 6% of test claims revealed no PA was necessary. The ability of the technician to run real-time test claims through the insurance has conserved resources by preventing unnecessary claims. Introduction: Three inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotic formulations are currently approved for the management of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in the USA. This retrospective study using US MarketScan databases assessed the use of antipseudomonal antibiotics (oral/IV) and hospitalizations due to pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients, who were treated with tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP), tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) or aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI).",

There is significant need for education and navigational support around insurance, as well as logistical support for lodging and transportation. A coordinated approach to addressing access barriers is critical for people with CF who are considering or have had a lung transplant. There is increasing recognition of the important role that pharmacists play in outpatient cystic fibrosis (CF) care. Recently, Yale's Adult CF Program received funding from the CF Foundation to introduce a pharmacist into our outpatient clinic, which serves 84 adult patients (age 20 to 81 years).

National Heart & Lung Inst., Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; 2. Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Objectives:Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and Aspergillus spp (Asp) are the most common bacterial and fungal organisms respectively to infect the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Whilst the detrimental effects of Pa infection are well documented, less is known about Asp colonisation despite rising prevalence in CF patients. In vitro studies suggest an inhibitory relationship of Pa against Asp, though the clinical effects of co-infection are not clear. Our aim is to examine this in a cross-sectional retrospective cohort study. Methods: Data from patients registered on the UK CF Registry in 2016 were used. Individuals were grouped into 6 cohorts according to infection status: 1) no Pa/Asp (clear), 2) Asp without Pa (Asp), 3) Intermittent Pa without Asp (IPa), 4) Intermittent Pa with Asp (IPaAsp), 5) Chronic Pa without Asp (CPa), 6) Chronic Pa with Asp (CPaAsp). For this analysis, Aspergillus positivity includes cultures of Aspergillus fumigatus and non-fumigatus species.",

These organisms have previously been associated with decline in lung function and health of adults with CF. Recommendations from the US CF Foundation and European CF Society agree that screening for these organisms is important.

Current recommendations are to use 3-4 antibiotics based on the susceptibilities. Clofazimine has been approved for use in Mycobacterium leprae and with investigational new drug (IND) approval can be used in treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus).

J Cyst Fibros. 2015;14:53-62)  and their acquisition and transmission pathways are poorly understood. Up to 25% of MABSC strains in people with CF are unique genotypes and may be acquired environmentally(Bryant JM, et al. Science. 2016;354:751-7). Potable water is a known environmental source of MABSC(Thomson R, et al. J Clin Microbiol.  2013;51:3006-11). This study investigates the presence of MABSC in potable water of hospitals and homes in Queensland, Australia.Methods: Hospital: Water was sampled from showers and sink taps (n=12) of The Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH) over 5 sampling time points (2014-17) and the former Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) at a single time point",

NTM infections in CF patients have been associated with an increased rate of FEV1 decline, and are characterised by necrotizing inflammation and bronchiectasis. Despite the increasing prevalence, NTM therapies are poorly effective, involving extended courses of multiple antibiotics via systemic administration that are hampered by high rates of drug toxicity.

Results: There were substantial variations in the LD 50 of both H 2 O 2 and HOCl amongst the clinical isolates during direct exposure of bacteria to the compounds. Depending on the GOX concentration, most strains were more resistant to H 2 O 2 than either HOSCN or HOCl during enzyme-mediated oxidant exposures; at [GOX] of 300 mU/mL and [LPO] of 1600 mU/mL, bacterial viability was increased by the addition of SCN -, resulting in the LPO-mediated consumption of H 2 O 2 and generation of HOSCN (p=0.0006 by paired t-test). Conclusions: Resistance to killing by natural antimicrobial oxidants produced during infections varies amongst genetically diverse clinical isolates of M. abscessus. In many cases, bacterial viability after exposure to GOX was increased in the presence of MPO or LPO/SCN -, as the toxic H 2 O 2 was converted to HOCl or HOSCN, which was less toxic to the bacteria. Future work will examine if there are correlations between susceptibility levels and clinical outcome of infection with these M. abscessus isolates.

Lung penetration profiles were highly comparable between ColistAir \u00ae and CMS/eFlow \u00ae . Based on preliminary PK analysis, plasma exposures (AUC and Cmax) are expected to be somewhat higher for a 1.4 MIU CMS dose administered as ColistAir \u00ae , compared to both 2 MIU CMS delivered by eFlow \u00ae and 1.66 MIU CMS given as Colobreathe\u2122. Final PK results will be available by June 2018.The results of this study demonstrate that CMS delivered as ColistAir \u00ae has a comparable safety profile to the comparator products and is well tolerated in HV.

Participant recorded duration of treatment was 1 (2) min longer and 5.8 (13.7) breaths less than that recorded by the PEPtrac. Participants found the PEPtrac very easy to use (0.1 [0.1] cms). Conclusion: The PEPtrac demonstrated excellent agreement with video analysis. Initial clinical evaluation demonstrated good clinical feasibility. The PEPtrac demonstrates good potential for objectively monitoring PEP ACT performance in clinical practice and research. Further clinical trials are required to determine if recording and real-time feedback of within-session data via the PEPtrac can optimise ACT performance and improve clinical outcomes.

Of the 1360 calls about benefits under individual or group plans, 53% (722) related to individual coverage, and 47% (636) related to group coverage. Only 1% (43) of calls about health benefits were from individuals with no health benefit coverage. This is an increase of 169% over 2016. Education: 4% (292) of all calls involved problems related to CF in school, especially in primary and secondary school. Employment: 5% (383) of all calls related to employment, a decrease of 15% ((383-451)/451) compared to 2016.Other:<1% (56) On other matters. Conclusions: Total calls received increased for the 20th consecutive year, indicating the continuing need for reliable information about legal issues in the CF community, and the CF Legal Information Hotline continues to meet this need. Concerns about Social Security eligibility and uncertainty about Congress's attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act drove increased calls from parents and individuals with CF, and drove increased calls about individual and group coverage, which more than doubled. Although the number of calls regarding Social Security benefits is unchanged over the prior year, concerns about Social Security benefits continue to be the single most frequent subject addressed by the CF Legal Information Hotline.IMPLEMENTING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEEON MENTAL HEALTH IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS GUIDELINES: PRACTICAL COMPLEXITIES OF MANAGING MENTAL HEALTH Verkleij, M. 1 ; Boekhoff, J. 1 ; Bon, I. 2 ; Haarman, E. 2 ; Nagelkerke, A. 2 ; Abbott, J. 3 1.

However, research is lacking regarding effective and feasible interventions for these concerns among CF populations. This study concludes our pilot study that suggested Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Behav Ther: 2004;35:639-65) is a feasible treatment, including via telehealth; reducing anxiety, depression, and cognitive fusion among CF patients (Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52(S47):476). Telehealth is ideal for CF patients, given exposure precautions, exacerbations, and distance from clinic. ACT differs from traditional cognitive behavioral therapy by emphasizing acceptance of painful inner experiences, thereby reducing the need for behaviors such as medication nonadherence that function to avoid anxiety and depression associated with thinking about having CF. We hypothesize that our ACT with CF protocol (Bennett DS, et al. Drexel Univ College of Medicine. 2016) will also improve lung function among people with CF.Methods: Adults with CF and elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms (screened via GAD-7 and PHQ-9) participated in 6 weekly manualized ACT sessions, delivered by a licensed psychologist (CVO'H) and graduate student trainees. Patients selected treatment in person or via telehealth (using HIPAA-compliant WebEx). Participants completed psychometric measures of depression (PHQ-9, BDI-II), anxiety (GAD-7, BAI) and cognitive fusion (CFQ13) at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of ACT, and 3 months post-treatment.

            "text": "Methods: A literature review about information sharing by adults with children across any health condition was undertaken. This included research on the development of cognitive processing and what may affect this (Bluebond-Langer, et al. 2001 \"Psychosocial Aspects of CF\"' Arnold Publishers), taking into account social, spiritual, cultural and any other factors which may influence this. We sought comments from service users, adults and older CF paediatric patients and peers including the UK Psychosocial Professionals group (UKPP-CF).Results: The resultant leaflet covers advice about talking to a child about CF, accounting for the family's culture of sharing information, and also provides further information about accessing other resources. Areas include: Why? -including encouraging honesty between patient and carers, promotes adherence to treatment. Who? -ensuring consistency amongst carers; When? -a process rather than a single event: What? -areas of the body that are affected, how did they get CF, what needs to be done every day to keep well, genes, fertility. How? -answering the child's questions as they arise in an age-appropriate way, opportunities of hospitalisation or outpatient clinic visits, encouraging learning about how the healthy body works and how a CF body can change this; honesty and what to do if the child asks a very difficult question. Other areas include pacing discussions about CF, checking understanding, and advice that the parent looks after their own emotional well-being. This has been distributed to parents; feedback from over 100 parents and colleagues has been positive.Discussion: This quality improvement initiative aimed to collate research, service user and colleague views to produce a leaflet to offer guidance to parents about informing children about CF. The leaflet has received positive feedback and is now used as an integral tool by our CF team. We hope that this will be useful in other centres to aid information sharing with children with CF. Furthermore the concepts could be taken and utilised for information givers to children about other diseases/conditions. (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2014;69:1090-7). CF Mental Health Guidelines recommend screening for depression and anxiety in individuals with CF using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2016;71:26-34). Psychological symptoms have been associated with worse Health-Related Quality of Life HRQoL (Goldbeck L, et al. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014;6:CD003148). It is well known that it is important to evaluate the effects of the disease and its treatments on daily functioning in several domains (e.g., respiratory symptoms, physical functioning, and vitality). To date, the relationship between psychological symptoms assessed considering the CF Mental Health Guidelines and Health-Related Quality of Life domains of Italian CF patients has never been systematically explored. This study investigates the relation between depression/anxiety symptoms and HRQoL domains in CF patients.",

Medicine, Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD, USA Introduction: Excessive alcohol use (EAU), a harmful pattern of drinking that includes both binge drinking and heavy use, occurs in 25% (binge) and 7% (heavy use) of the US population, respectively (NSDUH; SAMHSA 2015). Little is known about alcohol use in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). The objective of this investigation is to examine alcohol consumption patterns in individuals with CF using a self-report survey.Methods: Individuals with CF, 18 years of age or older, were recruited for participation in the study through social media and internet-based platforms. The survey included 36 questions that collected information about demographics, alcohol use, CF-related comorbidities, and self-reported health outcomes.Results: 1135 individuals initiated a survey with 952 meeting inclusion criteria and completing the survey. Of those included in the analysis cohort, N=729 (77%) currently consume alcohol, N=171 (18%) previously consumed alcohol, and N=52 (5%) never consumed alcohol. Amongst the people with CF who currently consume alcohol, N=174 (24%) met the requirements for heavy alcohol consumption and N=354 (49%) for binge-pattern consumption, with a combined N=371 (53%) meeting criteria for EAU. The figure shows reported typical alcohol use patterns in individuals with CF. Almost 30% of current drinkers experienced symptoms of harmful alcohol use including black-outs and guilt after drinking. Amongst the respondents who met criteria for EAU, 7% required oxygen, 6% had a lung transplant, 10% had CF liver disease and 32% had CF-related diabetes. Those with EAU reported more hospitalizations than those without EAU [244 (62%) vs 182 (54%), p=0.034]. Characteristics associated with EAU after multivariable adjustment included younger age, unmarried status, male gender and age \u226415 years at time of first alcoholic drink, which increased the odds of developing EAU by almost 6-fold [5.43 (2.97-9.94), p<0.01].Conclusion: EAU is occurring at a much higher proportion in individuals with CF, and a substantial proportion of CF individuals with EAU have multiple co-morbidities, where abstinence is recommended.

Center-specific data revealed that CF patients at the University of Mississippi Medical Center did not follow the national trend nor did they meet the CF Foundation's BMI percentile (%ile) recommendation of >50%ile. In 2015, registry data for patients ages 2-19 revealed an average BMI of 38.3%. As BMI >50%ile is correlated with better lung function and increased life span, our goal was to increase BMI %ile. The target population for the intervention was the 2-10 y old age group as they might be most amenable to change and set a strong foundation as they enter adolescence and adulthood.Methods: A multidisciplinary team was assembled including CF assistant center director, center coordinator, social worker, nurses, respiratory therapists, dietitian, GI and Endocrine physicians and parents of a patient with CF. The team met weekly with a quality coach and conducted an assessment of our patients' BMIs by reviewing center-specific data for 2014 and 2015. A fishbone diagram of factors contributing to low BMI was developed. Global and specific aims for improvement were written. The team developed a list of change ideas. Clinical, functional, costs and satisfaction outcomes using our Clinical Value Compass were examined and ideas for change were rapidly evaluated using a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model.Interventions: Using the PDSA model a number of change ideas were tested including:1. Increasing the number of patients seen by our dietitian at each clinic visit. Prior to starting our LLC2 cycle, we had a part-time dietitian who saw 20-60% of our CF patients each month. Soon after starting our project, a full-time dietitian was hired and \"patients seen\" increased to 93-100% of patients/month.2. Increasing the number of patients using nutritional supplements. Prior to the FUN LLC2, only 2% of patients in our target age group were receiving financial assistance for nutritional supplements. After submitting prescriptions to their insurance company and utilizing Healthwell program as a payer of last resort, the number using supplements increased to 75% in our target population.3. Optimizing pancreatic enzyme dosage in the target population. Average dose increased from 8604 lU lipase/kg/day to 9168 lU lipase/kg/day. 4 . Utilizing a nutrition tracker to keep track of all information related to our patients. 5 . Creating a nutrition algorithm to determine which patients needed closer follow-up and further interventions.6. Creating and distributing nutritional quizzes to assess patients' and families' knowledge.7. Hosting multiple local Education days around the state with greater attendance, family input and satisfaction.Results: Prior to the start of the LLC2 cycle 18 patients age 2-10 years were above the 50%ile for BMI and 18 patients below the 50%ile. At the end of the cycle in October 2017, 21 patients were above the 50%ile and 14 were below the 50%ile. Of the 14 patients below the 50%ile 7 showed increased BMIs by at least 5%.Conclusion: This project resulted in increased focus on BMI amongst all disciplines and improved BMIs in our target population.

Keck Medical Center of USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 3. Pulmonary Critical Care & Sleep Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA Introduction: The Cystic Fibrosis Learning Network (CFLN) is a collaborative network created to improve health and care through accelerated quality improvement (QI) initiatives. In 2016, a pediatric center developed a systematic approach to acute declines in lung function utilizing an algorithm (Schechter MS, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016; 51(S45) :402[abstr], Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52(S47):416[abstr]). As part of the CFLN, our CF care center selected a QI initiative on population management of lung function decline. An algorithm was created to utilize a similar systematic approach unique to our adult population. Discussion and development of an algorithm started in April 2017 with implementation in November 2017. The purpose of this initiative was to measure improvement in pulmonary health outcomes after implementation of the algorithm.Methods: Patients were stratified into the algorithm based on FEV1 decline at the clinic visit. Relative declines in FEV1 are calculated during clinic based on their best FEV1 in the past year. Each arm of the algorithm is broken down into the following acute FEV1 declines: <5%, 5-10%, >10%. Process measures utilized during the QI process include time to next follow-up clinic visit within 6 weeks, usage of antibiotics (intravenous (IV) or oral), and distribution of interventions. Study outcomes include percent of patients returning to baseline and mean FEV1 over the study period.Results: In patients with acute FEV1 declines \u2264-5%, 28/41 (68.3%) were brought back within 6 weeks at the start of the QI process in April 2017. From May until October 2017, patients were brought back a median of 52.4% of the time. After fully implementing the algorithm, patients were brought back a median of 69.4% between November 2017 to April 2018. Antibiotic usage increased after implementing the algorithm (November 2016-March 2017: 29% vs November 2017-February 2018: 44%). The most successful intervention for returning patients back to baseline was medication optimization or education (59.3%). Admission for IV antibiotics was successful in bringing patients back to baseline 50% of the time (n=18). Average FEV1 improved throughout the QI process, starting at 66% in April 2017 to a peak of 70.1% in November 2017 and has remained stable.Conclusions: Currently there is no clear definition for a pulmonary exacerbation; providers look at a variety of subjective and objective measures. The current algorithm utilizes relative decline in FEV1 and further stratifies patients into a treatment arm developed through QI processes in collaboration with the care team. Antibiotic usage has increased, however the rate of returning patients back to baseline in this study is not higher than previously reported data. The most successful intervention was medication optimization and education, when bringing patients back within 6 weeks. Since implementation of the algorithm, there has been an increase in mean FEV1 at our center. This demonstrates the utility of developing a systematic approach to improve outcomes in CF care and that a close follow-up may identify declines in lung function before progression to a pulmonary exacerbation.Conclusions: When children with CF are distinguished from among other symptomatic children referred to our clinic, baseline esophageal impedance tends to be lower for the CF cohort at both positions, but only significantly so in the proximal esophagus when the children with CF have GERD. Also, children with CF are apparently more likely to have abnormal PBI, compared to other symptomatic children without CF. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to further examine mucosal integrity in the proximal esophagus of children with CF and GERD.",

Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands; 8. Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, Netherlands; 9. University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands Introduction: Between 2 and 10% of patients with cystic fibrosis develop CF-related cirrhosis (CFC). The lifetime impact of CFC on mortality has so far not been quantified. The availability of a national registry on CF care and relevant outcomes offers a unique opportunity to assess the mortality risk of CF patients with or without CFC. We aimed to determine the role of CFC on CF patient survival based on national data of the Netherlands.Methods: We identified all CFC patients in the Netherlands who had been alive at 1-1-2009 , based on the review of medical records. CFC was defined either by ultrasound demonstration of the combination of inhomogeneous liver parenchyma and splenomegaly, or by the histological diagnosis. A control group was obtained from the national CF registry, consisting of 980 CF patients without CFC. We compared the groups with regard to survival and age at death, in the period 1-1-2009 to 31-12-2014. In case of mortality in either of the two groups, the primary cause of death was retrieved from the medical records.Results: We identified 103 CF patients with CFC and 980 CF patients without CFC at the start of the study period. In the subsequent 6 years, compared to the control group, the mortality rate was significantly higher in CFC patients (22/103, 21%) than in non-CFC controls (63/970, 6%; P<0.01). The median age of death was 10 years lower in CFC than in non-CFC patients (27 vs. 37 years, respectively; P=0.01). A significantly higher proportion of CFC patients died before the age of 25 years, compared to the control group (45% vs. 27%; P<0.01). At the start of the study period, CFC and non-CFC patients did not significantly differ in pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume at 1 s; % of predicted forced vital capacity), nor in body weight or body mass index, indicating similar clinical conditions at that moment. In the diseased CFC patients, the cause of death had been attributed to pulmonary disease in 68% of the cases, and to chronic or acute-on-chronic liver failure in 18%, several times subsequent to an elective surgical procedure.Conclusion: Our national data compellingly demonstrate that CFC is a critical risk factor for early mortality in CF patients and suggest that CFC has a negative effect on life expectancy of 10 years. The mortality seems either due to a strongly accelerated decline in pulmonary function or to liver failure, for example after an elective surgical procedure. A more detailed identification of CFC patients who have the highest risk of mortality seems now indicated for the consideration of preemptive liver transplantation.",

            "text": "Beattie, S.; Abdel-Rahman, S.; Snell, Y.A. The Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, MO, USA Background: It is well documented that optimal growth and nutrition is related to positive outcomes in persons with cystic fibrosis (CF). Specifically, CF guidelines state patients with body mass index (BMI) \u226550th percentile support better outcomes in relation to their FEV1 status (Stallings V, et al. J Am Diet Assoc. 2008; 108:832-9) . Children with CF are vulnerable to malnutrition for a variety of reasons including: increased daily nutritional needs, malabsorption/maldigestion and recurrent/chronic respiratory infections. A recent article reported concerns about BMI percentile being a poor predictor of nutritional status in children with CF (Konstan M, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2017; 16:158-60) . Pappas and coworkers found that mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) z-score classified more CF patients as malnourished compared with BMI z-score based on recommended malnutrition classifications (Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016; 51(S45):435[abstract] ). We conducted this study to examine the relationship between BMI z-score (zBMI), MUAC z-score (zMUAC), dietitian-derived malnutrition classifications and FEV1 in our CF patients.Methods: Age, weight, height, BMI, MUAC and FEV1 were collected for patients aged 4-19 years at CF standard of care clinic visits and/or during hospitalizations during 2015-2018. Based on the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) criteria for malnutrition classifications, we looked at concordance using the z-score threshold for malnutrition classifications among zBMI, zMUAC, weight z-score (zWt), height z-score (zHt) and percent FEV1. Standard descriptive statistics were used to analyze data.Results: To date, 322 observations (49% male, median age 12.2 years) were obtained in 209 unique CF patients. Though there is a significant relationship between nutritional status and FEV1 across the CF population (Table) , linear regression demonstrates that zBMI accounts for only 31% of the variability in FEV1 (rsq=0.310, p<0.01), compared with 25% for zMUAC (rsq=0.252, p<0.01), 31% for zWt (rsq=0.357, p<0.01) and 9% for zHt (rsq=0.090, p<0.01).Conclusions: Anthropometric measures alone are not robust predictors of pulmonary lung function as measured by FEV1 due to the broadness of the data given other variables. No single anthropometric measure shows a strong correlation with lung function. A cut-off point for using BMI \u226550th percentile fails to identify FEV1 status.",

Pediatric Pulmonary Division, Children's of AL/UAB CF Center, Birmingham, AL, USA Introduction: Despite intense nutritional interventions, including quarterly visits with dietitians, optimized pancreatic replacement therapy, oral supplements, G-tubes, and behavioral therapy, some patients with CF struggle with poor growth. As part of a pilot project for pediatric CF patients at significant nutritional risk with BMI < 25 percentile, we tested the effectiveness of delivering high calorie, high protein (HCHP) snack boxes to the patient's home in an effort to improve nutritional outcomes.Methods: At enrollment, the patient/family received a digital scale and a 3-month weight gain goal. Instructions on how to record weekly weight, and information sheets on caloric intake and recipe ideas were provided. Patients/families selected preferred HCHP snacks from a list of available items. Snack boxes with a 2-week supply of HCHP snacks were ordered by the CF dietitian and shipped from an online distributor to the patient's home every 2 weeks over a 3-month period. Follow-up telephone calls at 2-week intervals were made to record weekly weight from the home scale and to note changes in snack box preferences. Weight, BMI%, and BMI z-scores were recorded from clinic visits at four time points: 3 months pre-intervention, intervention (baseline), and at 3 and 6 months postintervention.Results: A total of 9 patients (6 male, 3 female), ages 12-20 years, were enrolled. During the 3-month intervention period, each patient received 7 snack-box shipments, each costing approximately $50, including delivery fee. Three patients were excluded from data analysis (1 death, 1 delivery issue to college campus, and 1 lost to follow-up). The Table presents the nutritional characteristics of participants (N=6, ages 12-17) before and after the intervention. Although the BMI% and BMI z-scores of participants declined due to an increase in linear growth, patient weight increased. The 3-month weight change at the end of the intervention was 1.1 kg, compared were divided into 4 consecutive age groups: first 13 C breath test on babies less than 5 months of age, second breath test between 6-9 months of age, third breath test between 9-12 months and fourth breath test between 9-24 months and with a different test meal (of yoghurt).Results: A percentage of between 39% (9-24 months old) to 56% (9-12 months old) of individual results were found lower compared to the minimum reference point in all age groups. Intra-individual variation of the 13 CO 2 response, in which no rate-limiting variation in pancreatic exocrine function was expected, was also assessed and showed that out of the 53 longitudinally assessed babies with three to four consecutive MTG breath tests, only 6 babies (3%) had consistent results above the minimum 13 C cut-off point during the three to four breath test assessments with NDIRS technique.Conclusion: The 13 C MTG breath test with NDIRS technique is too insensitive to determine pancreatic function status in babies within the first two years of life and therefore the faecal fat balance test remains the gold standard test in assessing CF patient's pancreatic function in the first two years of life. Introduction: Risk factors for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), a common hospital-acquired infection, include recent antimicrobial exposure, hospitalization and advanced age. Patients with a chronic disease such as cystic fibrosis (CF) require multiple courses of antimicrobials, and potentially lung transplantation, meaning they are at high risk of acquiring C. difficile or developing CDI. Recently, there have been cases of severe CDI in CF patients reported in Australia. The objectives of this project were to determine the prevalence of CDI or C. difficile colonisation in CF patients in Western Australia, and to study the molecular epidemiology of C. difficile strains from these patients.",

            "text": "Methods: From late June to December 2017, 24 CF patients who came for treatment or consultation at the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH) were recruited with informed consent. Faecal samples were collected on this initial visit, and after subsequent visits, and screened for C. difficile and toxins using EIA. All samples were also cultured for C. difficile and any isolates ribotyped and toxin gene profiled. Before the study started, 177 environmental samples were collected from the CF outpatient clinic and inpatient ward with MWE Polywipe sponges which were also cultured for C. difficile.Results: The prevalence of C. difficile colonisation in CF patients on the initial visit was 46% (11/24), increasing to 54% through the period of study as two patients became positive with C. difficile after antimicrobial treatment. One patient was persistently positive throughout the study. None of these three patients was symptomatic at the time of sample collection although one required CDI therapy within 6 weeks. The prevalence of C. difficile in the environment was 3% (6/177); 1/90 samples from the outpatient clinic and 5/87 samples from the ward. PCR ribotyping revealed 8 distinct ribotypes in patients, with the nontoxigenic strain RT 039 the most common (8 isolates) . RT 014/020 (3), RT, 046 (2), RT 103 (1), RT 012 (1), and RT QX 360 (1) were all toxigenic. The nontoxigenic RT 010 comprised 5 of 6 isolates found in the environment, however, this strain was not isolated from patients. Routine surveillance data for C. difficile in non-CF patients revealed that RT 014/020 was the most common ribotype found in WA during the study period. All toxigenic ribotypes found in CF patients were found in non-CF patients.Discussion: About half the C. difficile strains found in CF patients were toxigenic but no toxin was detected in the faeces of any culture-positive patient, suggesting possible protective effects of the CF intestinal milieu or microbiome. These asymptomatic carriers are however a potential source of C. difficile, and infection prevention and control procedures should be applied appropriately. Further studies should focus on the effect of the CF intestinal microbiome, CFTR mutations and CFTR modulator therapy on the epidemiology of CDI and C. difficile colonisation in CF patients. 1 1.

BMI, weight and height measurements were translated into z-scores based on national reference data. In SPSS \u00ae (version 24) a linear model for repeated measures was used. Results are given as medians and quartiles between brackets.Results: The total number of patients on tube feeding is 25 (11.1% of patients) (5 infants-toddlers (\u22645 years), 7 school-aged children (\u226412 years), 13 adolescents (13-18 years)). The median time on TF is 5 years (2.5; 6.1). At start the median age was 12.4 years (7-14.6 ). The results are presented in the Table. Initially, BMI improved significantly (p=0.002), but this evolution stabilized two years after the initiation of TF. Patients starting TF during puberty tend to return to their original BMI z-score. H z-score also improved significantly (p=0.007) beginning 2 years after the initiation of TF. However, effect was statistically and clinically significant in infants and school-aged children but less pronounced clinically significant in adolescents. Patients tend to have an improvement in FEV1% in the first years after the start of TF, however, on the long-term this effect is not sustained.Conclusion: The initiation of TF in paediatric CF patients leads to a significant improvement of BMI, height and lung function in the first year. However, when TF is started during puberty the effect on BMI is temporary without improved growth. Adolescents are also significantly more stunted than other age groups at start of TF. This age group is probably a more challenging group to convince or this might reflect older practices. Treatment adherence might also be an issue.were collected to assess substrate utilization (lipid vs. glucose) and changes in energy expenditure.Results: KG diet feeding resulted in marked weight loss in CF mice, while WT mice maintained body weight. Both CF and WT mice maintained normal glycemia and ketone body levels at fasting/refeeding when fed CHOW, however, when fed the KG diet, CF mice became hypoglycemic (WT KG 151.7\u00b17.3 vs. CF KG 64.6\u00b14.5 mg/dL, p<0.0001) with trending high ketone bodies (WT KG 3.3\u00b10.2 vs. CF KG 4.3\u00b10.5 mM, p=0.07) . Respiratory quotient showed CF mice switched completely to lipid utilization, while normally elevated energy expenditure markedly decreased in CF mice after 1 week of KG diet feeding.Conclusions: Overall, removal of dietary carbohydrates uncovered an abnormal pattern of energy utilization. CF mice poorly adapted to lipid and ketone body utilization to maintain energy homeostasis and body weight. Also, CF mice did not maintain blood glucose, likely via inefficient gluconeogenesis. This work highlights the importance of dietary carbohydrates in CF to maintain energy balance and blood glucose levels. Background: There is strong evidence that a higher weight-for-length or BMI are associated with better pulmonary function in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Better nutritional status in early childhood is associated with improved outcomes and survival at 18 years (Zemel BS, et al. J Pediatr. 2000; 137(3) :374-80). For this reason, the CF Foundation nutritional goal for all children with CF is a weight-for-length or BMI \u2265 50th percentile.Objective: To design and implement a nutritional care algorithm using a multidisciplinary quality improvement approach aimed at improving weight-for-length/BMI status in children with CF ages 1-12 years over 3 consecutive visits.Methods: We developed an evidence-based guideline (EBG) with inclusion criteria for CF patients with weight-for-length or BMI <50th percentile, or weight <10th percentile, without a G-tube, who were 1-12 years old. The EBG took a step-wise approach to evaluation and incorporated components of Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the CFF EBG Preschool Nutrition Algorithm. The EBG included in-clinic assessments and questionnaires by nursing and nutrition as well as development of a multidisciplinary plan to address defined symptoms or behaviors of concern labeled \"red flags.\" The red flags encompassed the areas of dietary concerns, GI symptoms, enzyme administration and medication concerns, behavioral concerns, and weight gain velocity. Parameters were defined for expedited referral to GI with a goal of appointments within one month. The EBG was implemented in February 2017 and patients were identified for inclusion at our pediatric CF Center multidisciplinary meeting as part of our quality improvement review.Results: In the first year of implementation, there were 49 patients identified as \"at nutritional risk.\" We tracked patient progress over a period of 3 visits. Overall, the median weight-for length/BMI of the patients identified increased from the 32.54th percentile at visit 1 to the 36.25th percentile at visit 3.Conclusion: About half of the identified patients increased their weight-for-length/BMIs from visit 1 to 2 and visit 2 to 3. Five patients were referred to GI as a result of their nutritional status. The nutrition EBG and our multidisciplinary approach increased the weight-for length/BMI percentile in patients at nutritional risk. Our median starting weight-for length/BMI at the 32.54th percentile indicated the need for a revision to our inclusion criteria. We have amended the EBG to include CF patients with weight-for-length or BMI < 35th percentile. We will continue to utilize our assessment tools and track the weight-for length/BMI of these patients over consecutive visits.",

Chiesi USA, Inc., Cary, NC, USA; 3. Digestive Care Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA; 4. University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, USA Background: Patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) require pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) to meet their nutritional needs. Some patients with EPI may also need a gastrostomy tube (G-tube) to maintain optimal nutritional status, and administering PERT via a G-tube is often necessary and/or preferred for these patients. Pancrelipase (Pertzye) 4,000 United States Pharmacopeia (USP) lipase units capsules are a PERT approved for administration via G-tube. These pancrelipase (Pertzye) capsules feature spherically shaped, enteric-coated microspheres with a distinct diameter range that is smaller than those in the product's larger available capsule sizes. The aim of this study was to examine G-tube administration of the pancrelipase (Pertzye) capsule contents delivered via various delivery configurations and vehicles.Methods: This in vitro study assessed the feasibility, push force, and enteric-coated microsphere stability and integrity of pancrelipase (Pertzye) 4,000 USP lipase units capsule contents delivered via G-tube. Capsules were opened and their contents sprinkled onto one of 3 brands of applesauce (pH <4.0; Mott's \u00ae , Musselman's \u00ae , and Gerber \u00ae Stage 2 brand). Mixtures were stirred to achieve uniform microsphere suspension, transferred into a syringe (size 10, 12, or 35 mL), and delivered into a G-tube (size 14 French; Kimberly Clark MIC-KEY \u00ae or Covidien Nutriport \u00ae brand) using steady pressure over 10 to 12 seconds. Feasibility and push force were assessed using developed methods, while microsphere stability/integrity was assessed using standard methods.Results: G-tube administration of pancrelipase (Pertzye) 4,000 USP lipase units capsule contents was feasible, as assessed by the successful delivery of microspheres through multiple compatible syringe/G-tube configurations. The 35-mL syringe had the greatest compatibility with the different G-tube brands examined. With a single exception, the contents of 2 pancrelipase (Pertzye) capsules suspended in 10 mL of any brand of applesauce were delivered through each compatible syringe/G-tube configuration tested without obstruction. For the 12-mL syringe/MIC-KEY G-tube configuration, some clogging was noted using Gerber Stage 2 applesauce; reduction of the capsule contents by half (ie, suspension of 1 capsule in 10 mL of applesauce) resulted in successful delivery in this configuration. Addition of suspended, enteric-coated microspheres to applesauce did not meaningfully affect the push force required for delivery via G-tube. Microsphere stability and integrity, as assessed by mean lipase activity and dissolution lipase activity, were maintained at \u226595% and \u226589% of initial levels, respectively, exceeding prespecified acceptance tolerances.Conclusions: Delivery of pancrelipase (Pertzye) 4,000 USP lipase units capsule contents suspended in applesauce via G-tube is feasible and maintains microsphere stability and integrity. These findings support the FDA's approval of the updated pancrelipase (Pertzye) product label to include the G-tube administration route.",

Johns Hopkins All Childrens, St. Petersburg, FL, USA Background: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at risk of developing a vitamin D insufficiency, defined as a 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) serum level <30 ng/mL. Vitamin D insufficiency has been linked to increased inflammatory markers, poor bone health, and increased pulmonary exacerbations in those with CF. Screening and treatment guidelines were published by the CF Foundation in 2012. Since that time, our clinic has continued to observe poor vitamin D levels despite additional supplementation per these guidelines. As part of a quality improvement Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia CF Center who were prescribed insulin prior to nocturnal gastrostomy tube feeds was conducted. Individuals with CF liver disease (CFLD), Type 1 diabetes, or treated with daytime insulin were excluded. Weight, height, BMI, one-hour and two-hour glucose from oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and FEV 1 %-predicted were recorded from CF Center visits 6-12 months pre-and post-insulin initiation; subjects were receiving nocturnal tube feedings throughout this study period. Weight-Z, Height-Z and BMI-Z were calculated using CDC 2000 reference data.Data are presented as median [min; max]. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare maximum BMI-Z, Weight-Z, Height-Z, and FEV1 percent predicted pre-and post-insulin initiation.Results: Of the 60 patients on nocturnal tube feeds, 9 (7M/2F) patients met inclusion criteria. None had CF-related diabetes (CFRD) by OGTT. Age at time of insulin initiation was 10 years [7; 13.6 ]. One-hour OGTT glucose was 165 mg/dL [126; 333] and two-hour OGTT glucose was 107 mg/dL [82; 195] . BMI-Z post-insulin (1.07 [-0.098; 1.29 ]) tended to be higher than pre-insulin (0.76 [-0.82; 1.39]), p = 0.09. Weight-Z post-insulin (-0.073 [-1.14; 0.74]) tended to be higher than pre-insulin (0.28 [-1.05; 0.72]), p = 0.07. Height-Z post-insulin (-1.63 [-2.15 ; 0.91]) was not different than pre-insulin (-1.46 [-2.17 ; 0.95]), p = 0.11. FEV1 % predicted post-insulin (99 [74; 120]) was not different than pre-insulin (102 [83; 118], p = 0.91.Discussion: Six to twelve months of treatment with insulin prior to overnight enteral feeds in nondiabetic patients with CF tended to be associated with improved nutritional status. While this study did not directly assess nocturnal hyperglycemia during tube feeds, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin therapy may address such undetected glucose elevations during overnight enteral feeds. Prospective studies should focus on the contribution of overnight enteral feeds to perturbed glucose homeostasis as well as the role of empiric insulin initiation in optimizing nutritional status and preserving \u03b2-cell function in individuals receiving overnight enteral feeds.",

Biostatistics, Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, CO, USA Background: In youth with cystic fibrosis (CF), current guidelines define abnormal glycemia (AG) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as follows: fasting plasma glucose \u2265100 mg/dL, 1 hour glucose (1hG) \u2265200 mg/dL, and/or 2 hour glucose (2hG) \u2265140 mg/dL. In type 2 diabetes, the oral disposition index (oDI) is a reliable measure of insulin secretion relative to sensitivity and is a strong predictor of diabetes progression. Additionally, oDI has been described to be abnormal in the early development of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). Morphologic characteristics of the OGTT glucose curve are reported to identify risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in obese youth. Whether such OGTT characteristics better predict oDI abnormalities in CF when compared to traditional OGTT criteria has not been studied. Our aim was to compare 3 alternate methods of classifying OGTT glucose results in CF youth: 1. shape of the curve (biphasic vs monophasic), 2. time to glucose peak (<30 minutes vs \u226530 minutes), and 3. 1hG <155 mg/dL vs \u2265155 mg/dL, to traditional OGTT criteria defining AG to determine which best identifies lower oDI.Methods: CF youth 10-18 years underwent a 2-hour 75 g OGTT with glucose and insulin concentrations obtained every 30 minutes. Participants taking insulin were excluded. In addition to traditional OGTT criteria, participants were classified by the 3 alternate methods as AG (monophasic shape of curve, glucose peak at >30 minutes, 1hG \u2265155 mg/dL) or normal glycemia (NG) (biphasic shape of curve, glucose peak at <30 minutes, 1hG <155 mg/dL). oDI ((\u0394 0-30 minutes insulin/ \u0394 0-30 minutes glucose)* 1/fasting insulin) was calculated. Mean oDI and clinical outcomes including BMI, %FEV1, and %FVC were also calculated and compared to predefined morphologic groups with ANOVA. Associations between oDI and clinical outcomes were evaluated with linear regression.Results: N=52 CF youth completed an OGTT: NG, N=11; AG, N=41; mean\u00b1SD age 13\u00b14 years; 37% male; BMI z-score 0.0\u00b10.8; FEV1% 88\u00b116.3; FVC% 97\u00b114.8. Peak glucose and insulin concentrations differed significantly between the NG and AG groups defined by traditional criteria (p<0.05); however, the oDI comparison for insulin was not significantly different. In contrast, early vs. late time to peak glucose and 1hG < vs. \u2265155 mg/dL showed a significant oDI difference (0.17\u00b10.09 vs. 0.09\u00b10.05, p=0.0302; 0.16\u00b10.09 vs. 0.08\u00b10.05, p=0.0184) while monophasic vs biphasic did not (0.17\u00b10.09 vs. 0.09\u00b10.06, p=0.2047). Neither traditional OGTT nor alternate morphologic groups predicted BMI or pulmonary function outcomes and oDI was not associated with BMI, %FEV, or %FVC.Conclusions: Alternate OGTT measures including time to peak glucose and 1hG better identify abnormalities in insulin secretion as identified by oDI than traditional OGTT criteria. Further studies, including prospective follow-up, are required to determine whether these alternate methods identify those at greater risk for future clinical decline in CF.",

            "text": "Sheikh, S.; Kelly, A.; Rubenstein, R.C. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA Objectives: While nutritional recommendations in cystic fibrosis (CF) focus on body mass index (BMI), this measure is a surrogate for body composition. Lean body mass (LBM) correlates more strongly with pulmonary function than does BMI, and the relationship between BMI and LBM is perturbed in CF. Moreover, LBM deficits are one potential mechanism through which cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) confers increased pulmonary morbidity. We hypothesized that worsening glucose tolerance is associated with LBM deficits relative to fat mass (FM) and BMI.Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is present in over 40% of adult CF patients, and is characterized by decreased insulin secretion. CFRD shares many characteristics of both types of classical diabetes, though it may more closely resemble type 2 diabetes, because of the decreased insulin response, lack of auto-pancreatic antibodies and similar genetic predispositions. As in type 2 diabetes, it is hypothesized that ER stress and impaired insulin biogenesis could contribute to CFRD. Our group has demonstrated that the ER chaperone ERp29 (endoplasmic reticulum protein of 29 kDa) is critical for the biogenesis of CFTR (Suaud L, et al. J Biol Chem. 2011; 286:21239) and ENaC (Grumbach Y, et al. AJP Cell Physiol. 2014; 307:C701) .Rationale: The biogenesis of insulin and ENaC share many key features. 1. Both proinsulin and ENaC can be processed by furin-like convertases in the Golgi into a more active from (insulin and cleaved, higher P o ENaC, respectively). 2. Both proteins are likely transported from the ER to the Golgi by COP II machinery. 3. Both proinsulin and ENaC can bypass this processing in the Golgi to be secreted (as proinsulin) or arrive at the apical membrane (as uncleaved, low P o ENaC) in a less active form. In addition, elevated secreted proinsulin/insulin ratios are seen in both CFRD and Type 2 diabetes, suggesting impaired insulin processing (Sheikh S, et al. Diabetes. 2017; 66:134) .Hypothesis: ERp29 is a critical factor in promoting the efficient conversion of proinsulin to insulin.Preliminary Results: Proinsulin co-immunoprecipitates with ERp29: INS-1 rat insulinoma cells and Min-6 mouse insulinoma cells were each lysed under nondenaturing conditions. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rat anti-C-peptide and rabbit ERp29 antibodies and precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. ERp29 co-precipitated with anti-C-peptide, which may suggest co-precipitation with proinsulin, and both insulin and proinsulin co-precipitated with anti-ERp29. ERp29 regulates insulin secretion: INS-1 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant ERp29s (C157S, \u0394KEEL, KDEL). Cells transfected with the mutant ERp29s had decreased insulin secretion in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion experiments. Similarly, siRNA-mediated depletion of ERp29 increased proinsulin secretion in Min-6 cells. These data, taken together with the immunoprecipitation data, suggest that functional ERp29 interacts with and plays an important role in insulin biogenesis and secretion. ERp29 and proinsulin form a complex with the KDEL receptor: Lysates of Min-6 cells prepared under nondenaturing conditions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-C-peptide, anti-ERp29 or anti-KDEL Receptor. Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Both ERp29 and proinsulin were found to co-precipitate with the KDEL receptor.Conclusion: Together, these data support the hypothesis that ERp29 plays a role in the conversion of proinsulin to insulin, as well as begin to suggest a role for the KDEL receptor in this process.Acknowledgments: Supported by grants from NIH (R01 HL135670) and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder, that is often associated with malnutrition, secondary to intestinal malabsorption, inadequate intake, and increased energy expenditure. With an early CF diagnosis, more focus on nutritional failure and increased use of nutritional supplements, the prevalence of malnutrition among patients with CF has significantly declined. While the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the general population are substantial, nutritional status in the CF population is varied and recent studies indicate that the prevalence of obesity is also increasing in children and adults with CF. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and factors associated with overweight and obesity in adults with CF. We performed a cross-sectional analysis, which included 484 adult patients with CF who were seen at the University of Minnesota CF Center between January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2017.",

Bivariate association between predictors and the dichotomous BMI was evaluated using chi-square test or two-sample t-test depending on the nature of the variable. Multivariate analyses were conducted using logistic regression models. Variables that were significant at the 0.10 level in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis. Backward model selection method was used to select the best set of predictors.Mean age of this cohort was 35.2 (SD=11.6), 95% were white and 45% were female. 5.2% were underweight (BMI < 18.5), 62.6% had normal weight (BMI \u2265 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ), 25.6% were overweight (BMI \u2265 25-29.9 kg/m 2 ) and 6.6% patients were obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ). Bivariate analyses of associations with BMI \u226525 kg/m 2 (32% of population), show that gender (25% in female vs. 38% in male, p=0.0036), age at CF diagnosis (mean age of 11.6 among BMI \u226525 vs. 4.8 among BMI <25, p<0.0001), CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genotype classification (62% in mild vs. 25% in severe vs. 30% in unclassified, p<0.0001), and pancreatic insufficiency status (26% in pancreatic insufficient patients vs. 63% in pancreatic sufficient patients, p<0.0001) were significantly associated with BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 . CF-related diabetes was trending towards significance (28% vs. 36%, p=0.067). Multivariate regression analyses show that the best set of predictors of BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 were gender (female vs. male OR=0.46, p=0.0013), CFTR genotype classification (mild vs. severe OR=3.44, p=0.0003), and age at CF diagnosis (OR=1.03, p=0.0064). CFTR modulator (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) was not significantly associated with BMI \u2265 25 kg/m 2 .In our patient population, prevalence of overweight and obesity is significant. Male gender, older age at CF diagnosis, mild CFTR genotype and pancreatic sufficient status were associated with overweight/obesity. Background: Aging cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are at high risk of developing glucose intolerance, which can lead to CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Decrease in insulin secretion over time is the main hypothesis to explain this increasing prevalence but mechanisms, especially in older patients are still not well elucidated.",

Baseline and follow-up 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; with glucose and insulin measurements every 30 minutes for 2 hours), pulmonary function test (FEV1) and anthropometric measurements were performed the same day. Inclusion visit in the MCFC and last visit were included in this analysis. Insulin sensitivity was measured by the Stumvoll Index.Results: After a mean follow-up of 9.9 \u00b1 2.6 years, mean age at follow-up was 43.5 \u00b1 8.1 years old. An increase of body weight (+2.6 \u00b1 6.5 kg, p = 0.01) and a decrease in pulmonary function (FEV1; 73.4 \u00b1 21.2% to 64.5 \u00b1 22.4%, p \u2264 0.001) were observed. Overall, insulin secretion is maintained at follow-up but all OGTT glucose values increased (for all values, p \u22640.028). At follow-up, 28.3% of patients had a normal glucose tolerance while 71.7% had abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT). AGT patients decreased their insulin sensitivity over time (p = 0.029) while it remained the same in patients with normal glucose tolerance (p = 0.917).Conclusion: In older CF patients the progression of impaired glucose tolerance is occurring with stable insulin secretion but reduced insulin sensitivity. Introduction: Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both diabetes and its chronic complications in adults. Little is known about inflammation levels in three common types of diabetes in youth: Type 1 diabetes (T1D), Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD).",

Vascular inflammation was assessed by sE-selectin (ELISA) and systemic inflammation by hsCRP (turbidimetry), as well as WCC and ESR in those undergoing diabetes complications assessment. Nephropathy was defined as elevated albuminuria (\u226520\u00b5g/min). Cardiac autonomic neuropathy was assessed by measures of heart rate variability (HRV) on a 10-min continuous electrocardiogram, peripheral nerve function by vibration and thermal threshold testing and retinopathy by 7-field stereoscopic fundal photography. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA and regression analyses were performed, with significance at p<0.05.Results: T1D participants had higher HbA1c than T2D and CFRD (8.5 [7.7-9.5 ] vs 6.6 [5.6-9.2] vs 5.9 [5.7-6.5 ]%, p<0.001) and longer diabetes duration (8 [5-11] vs 2 [0-3] vs 2 [1] [2] [3] [4] years, p<0.001). Comparing T1D vs T2D or CFRD, inflammatory markers were lower in T1D (p<0.05). sE-selectin and hsCRP levels in CFRD were higher though not significantly than in CF subjects without diabetes (p=0.2; p=0.15). T1D and CFRD compared to T2D had less albuminuria (1 and 0 vs 19%) and less peripheral nerve abnormalities (5 and 0 vs 19%). HRV abnormalities were less common in T1D in contrast to T2D and CFRD (28 vs 54 vs 50%). In multivariable analysis, hsCRP and ESR were associated with complications after adjusting for HbA1c, BMI and diastolic blood pressure (hsCRP: odds ratio (OR)=2.2, p=0.02; ESR: OR=2.5, p<0.04). In addition, BMI was independently associated with hsCRP (correlation coefficient (CC)=0.3, p=0.001) and ESR (CC=0.2, p<0.03).Conclusion: Inflammatory markers, including sE-selectin, hsCRP, WCC and ESR are elevated in adolescents with diabetes, being higher and comparable in T2D and CFRD than in T1D. The association between inflammation and diabetes complications is consistent with inflammation driving vascular pathology in diabetes. Background: Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common nonpulmonary manifestation of CF and is associated with decline in pulmonary function, compromised nutritional status, and increased mortality. The bionic pancreas (BP) is a closed-loop system of glycemic management that employs continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) coupled with mathematical algorithms to automatically administer insulin with or without glucagon. The BP has been shown to both simultaneously lower mean CGM glucose and time spent in hypoglycemic ranges in patients with type 1 diabetes while improving quality of life measures.",

Pulmonary, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have an increased prevalence of depression and anxiety compared to the general population, which contributes to poor treatment adherence and worsened clinical outcomes. Little is known regarding clinical factors contributing to the development of poor mental health in the CF population. Another co-morbidity in this population is CF-related diabetes (CFRD), which affects 35% of patients by 30 years of age. Research assessing the impact of newly diagnosed CFRD is limited, but qualitative studies have revealed patients with feelings of increased disruption, anxiety, and confusion related to their CFRD treatment regimen. No studies have been conducted evaluating anxiety or depression relative to a diagnosis of CFRD. We hypothesized that CFRD increases risk of anxiety and depression in CF patients and is associated with worse clinical outcomes.Purpose: Our purpose was to evaluate the association between new CFRD diagnosis and the mental health of patients with CF, particularly a diagnosis of anxiety and depression.Methods: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was completed including CF patients seen at our institution from 2009-2017. Diagnoses of CFRD, depression, and anxiety were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and verified by manual chart review. Group comparisons according to new CFRD diagnosis were assessed using two-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict anxiety and depression according to CFRD diagnosis.Results: The analysis included 238 patients with a mean age of 31 \u00b1 12 years. Of the patients included in the analysis 83 (35%) had a new diagnosis of CFRD, 71 (30%) were diagnosed with depression, and 86 (36%) were diagnosed with anxiety. On multivariable analysis adjusting for sex, CFTR mutation, and age, patients with CFRD were more likely to have depression than CF patients without CFRD (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7; p=0.02). The adjusted association between CFRD diagnosis and anxiety did not reach statistical significance (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.9; p=0.11).Conclusions: Our results suggest an association between CFRD diagnosis and worse mental health among patients followed at our institution. The association of CFRD diagnosis with increased likelihood of depression may be stronger than its association with increased likelihood of anxiety. Mental health sequelae of CFRD diagnosis may complicate CF patients' adherence and self-management.Acknowledgements: Supported by CF Foundation Clinical Fellowship Grant. Background: People with CF experience myriad physical, emotional, and socioeconomic burdens, all of which affect quality of life (QoL) for patients and their families. Although specialty palliative care (PC) reduces suffering and improves QoL for individuals with serious illness, no evidence exists for its impact in CF. As such, we conducted the first randomized clinical pilot trial of a specialty PC intervention in CF.",

Using these data, we developed InSPIRe:CF (Integrating Supportive care to Prepare, Improve QoL, and Reduce suffering:CF), a protocolized, patient-centered PC intervention based on the Chronic Care Model. InSPIRe:CF embeds a PC clinician within the CF center, working alongside usual CF care providers. InSPIRe:CF is delivered concomitantly with usual CF care. Patients receive at least four in-person visits (and follow-up calls as needed) with a PC clinician, addressing four main foci: symptom management, emotional support, advance care planning and goals of care, and coping and resilience. This single-site, two-arm, unmasked, parallel randomized pilot clinical trial evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness of InSPIRe:CF. We measured feasibility via enrollment and outcome assessment rates. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews to evaluate acceptability, perceived effectiveness, and barriers and facilitators to trial participation. Two investigators independently analyzed qualitative data using thematic analysis.Results: We randomized 50 adults with CF to InSPIRe:CF plus usual care, or usual care alone (approach-to-randomize rate, 79%). Fifty-six percent of our sample was male, with a median age of 32 years (range: 18-67), and median FEV 1 of 41% predicted (range: 20-82% predicted) at enrollment. Of 50 participants randomized, two died and one was lost to follow-up. Overall, 67% of intervention participants reported the intervention was not burdensome and 100% agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the PC clinician's care. Sixty-seven percent of participants agreed or strongly agreed that the intervention improved their physical symptoms, 62% improved their QoL, and 100% felt that all patients with CF should receive specialty PC. Preliminary themes identified from analysis of summative interviews include: 1) appreciation of the patient-centeredness of a PC approach; 2) endorsement of the importance of goals of care elicitation and advance care planning discussions; and 3) a desire to expose individuals with CF to specialty PC at earlier stages of their disease.Conclusions: Embedding specialty PC within usual CF management is feasible, acceptable, and perceived to be effective among individuals living with CF. Given these promising findings, further randomized clinical trials are warranted to establish the effectiveness and optimal delivery models of specialty PC in CF.Acknowledgments: Supported by CFF PILEWS14QI0, NHLBI K0133466.

Referral pathways of treatment were investigated.Results: Participants reported more and different psychosocial problems (e.g. stress, relationship problems) at clinical assessment that required psychosocial treatment. Treatment was provided for 48 participants (10 CF adolescents, 25 mothers and 13 fathers) who mainly scored nonelevated on the PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7.

Deviation from the guidelines occurred in this study as all participants underwent clinical assessment allowing an evaluation of the screening process. Many CF patients and caregivers, who screened in the nonelevated range on depression and anxiety also required treatment, highlighting the complexity and demand for mental health provision.

We identified patients using the CF Foundation registry, then conducted a manual chart review. Included patients were \u226518 years of age at the time of death or LT. The primary location for their CF care was the Univ. of Texas Southwestern. Statistical analyses utilized chi-square contingency table analysis comparing patients who received a LT to those that died without receiving a LT on each categorical variable, and a Student's t-test for independent groups to compare the two groups on each numerical value. The primary outcomes were 1) whether an EOL discussion occurred, 2) the time of EOL discussion prior to death or LT, 3) if the patient was evaluated by PC, and 4) whether they had an advanced directive (AD) or medical power of attorney (MPOA).Results: We identified 23 patients who died without LT and 40 patients who received a LT for end-stage CF. Median age of those who died was 27, and for those who received a transplant was 28. Patients who died were 39% female, and 53% were female in the LT group. Among patients who received a LT, 6/40 (15%) had EOL conversations with a pulmonologist compared with 17/23 (74%) who died (p<0.0001). Patients who died were more likely to have PC involved (57% v. 5%, p=0.001). Timing of EOL conversations was similar for patients who died (9/17, 53% occurred >6 months prior to death) compared to those who had received a LT (2/6, 33% >6 months prior to LT) (p=0.640). Patients who died were more likely Prior research has shown that pediatric CF patients with low or moderate adherence to medications are likely to have increased rates of hospitalization and higher healthcare costs. In adults, the role of medication adherence in maintaining stable lung function is less clear.Objective: To examine the relationships between medication adherence, barriers to adherence, and lung function as measured by \u0394FEV 1 in adults with CF.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting for follow-up from January 2018 to April 2018. Patients were included if they were age \u2265 18, using at least one key CF lung therapy (bronchodilator, hypertonic saline, dornase alfa, airway clearance, inhaled antibiotics), had a PFT, and completed a survey assessing adherence and barriers to adherence at the same visit. Post-lung transplant patients were excluded. Lung function was measured by \u0394FEV 1 , defined as the percent change in FEV 1 on the day of the visit vs their personal best in the previous 12 months. Stable lung function was defined as \u0394FEV 1 > -5%, and an acute decline in lung function as \u0394FEV 1 \u2264 -5%. Adherence rates were reported in two groups, with \u2264 50% adherence being \"low\" and > 50% adherence being \"moderate-high.\" Barriers to adherence were assessed using survey responses.Results: A total of 88 out of 130 patients met inclusion criteria for this study. The average age was 32 \u00b1 9 years. The majority of patients were white (92%), male (55%), and had at least a high school education (82%). Almost one-third (26%) identified as Hispanic/Latino. The odds of presenting with an acute decline in lung function with low adherence vs. moderate-high adherence was not significantly different (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.81, 2.14). The most frequently reported barriers to adherence related to the lifestyle burden of treatments -patients indicating they don't have time to perform a therapy (46% of reported barriers) or they forget (26%). Significantly more patients endorsed forgetting as a barrier in the stable group (19.3%) vs. the acute decline group (11.2%), \u03c7 2 (1, N = 88) = 5.038, P = .02.Conclusions: In this adult CF population, the estimated odds of presenting with an acute decline in lung function were 33% higher for patients reporting low adherence vs. those reporting moderate-high adherence. While not significant, this trend mirrors previous research that found worse adherence to pulmonary medications was associated with higher acute healthcare use in CF patients age \u2265 6 years (Quittner AL, et al. Chest. 2014; 146 (1):142-51). The lifestyle burden of CF treatments was identified as the major barrier to adherence. This is in agreement with previous studies in pediatric CF populations that identified \"time management\" and \"forgetting\" as top barriers to adherence (Modi AC, et al. J Pediatr Psychol. 2006; 31(8) :846-58). The significant increase in the number of stable patients endorsing forgetting as a barrier to adherence highlights an opportunity for the CF care team to engage patients in discussions regarding the role of each treatment in maintaining overall lung health, and to design patient-specific interventions to overcome barriers related to treatment burden.",

            "text": "Passamano, I.Y. Cystic Fibrosis Relief Fund, Inc., Houston, TX, USA Introduction: Hurricane Harvey is the second most destructive hurricane in U.S. history. It covered 1260-square-miles of Harris County Texas with over 1.5 ft of water, including 1/3 of Houston. Over 100,000 people evacuated their homes. Among those affected were \u2248200 households with a person with cystic fibrosis. However, none of the existing relief agencies specifically addressed the unique needs of people with cystic fibrosis affected by the hurricane.Study Question: Is there a need for disaster relief targeted to individuals with cystic fibrosis affected by disasters?Method: The Cystic Fibrosis Relief Fund, Inc. (CFRF) was established by Isabella Passamano days after Hurricane Harvey as a nonprofit corporation to raise funds and deliver assistance to individuals with cystic fibrosis affected by the disaster. The CFRF coordinated efforts with local pediatric and adult CF centers in Houston. CF center social workers referred to CFRF individuals and families needing assistance or confirmed that an individual or family was in need. This coordination allowed CFRF to identify individuals most in need, identify their specific need, reduce cost and delays, deliver assistance without complex paperwork or unnecessary vetting procedures. Requests for relief are received in writing by email and presented to the CFRF Board to determine if:1. The request is by or for an individual with CF; 2. The need is caused by the hurricane; 3. The individual lacks resources (i.e., lacks available income or resources to meet their immediate need of food, healthcare, clothing or shelter); and 4. The request is needed to meet an immediate need of food, healthcare, clothing, or shelter.CFRF raised funds from donors and delivered assistance to 42 individuals or families. CFRF directly paid vendors for large goods (e.g., mattresses, refrigeration for medicine) and services (e.g., rent, utilities). Direct payment assured that the funds were used for the intended purpose. Funds for food and fuel were delivered via debit cards for easy distribution and use.Discussion: Requests were for items needed to re-establish a household such as clean bedding; mattresses; food; rent; relocation costs; kitchen items; clothing; and fuel. 50% of funds dispersed were for mattresses and bedding; 20% for food; 14% for housing and relocation expenses; 9% for household and kitchen items (including refrigeration for medications); 4% for clothing; and 3% for fuel, gasoline, and utilities. Requests are reviewed and confirmed within 2 days, and relief is delivered in 5 days. 81% of recipients received food assistance and at least one other form of aid. 100% of the individuals requesting relief received assistance.CFRF expanded its scope to include individuals with CF affected by Hurricane Irma in Florida and by California wildfires in late 2017.The CFRF is now expanding its scope to form a National CF Relief organization to deliver assistance to CF families affected by food insecurity and by future disasters.Conclusion: Individuals with cystic fibrosis need targeted disaster relief because they have unique needs not met by FEMA or other relief agencies. Coordination with CF center in the affected area is essential to a quick and proper assessment of requests. CFRF effectively and rapidly delivered relief to individuals with CF affected by three disasters. Background: In accordance with new CF mental health guidelines, the UNC Adult CF team performs universal screening for anxiety and depression and offers individual therapy (in-person or via teletherapy) for those with positive screens. Through this process, we identified feelings of isolation and loneliness as being an important theme. Since the early 1990s, CF patients have had limited exposure to other patients with CF due Conclusion: There are many factors that influence patient readiness to discuss ACP and EOLC, and completion of advance directives. With improving life expectancy and care options for adults with CF, planning for the future remains crucial. In this small single-center study, there is suggestion of an increase in thinking, talking, and planning for the future amongst our adult outpatient population over the past 5 years. Larger, multicenter longitudinal studies could better elucidate patterns. The multidisciplinary CF team should continue efforts to educate and encourage our patients to plan for the future. (Kazmerski TM, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2018; 17:57-63) . The goal of this study is to explore contraceptive use and pregnancy history among reproductive-aged women with cystic fibrosis (CF), and to ultimately assess the association of contraceptives and pregnancy with health status. We also evaluate contraceptive use and proportion of pregnancies coinciding with CFTR modulator use. Current recommendations suggest that women on CFTR modulators use contraception other than combined hormonal contraceptive pills, if they wish to avoid pregnancy (Ren CL, et al. Ann Am Thorac Soc. 2018; 15:271-80) .",

They consented to CFFPR access and completed an online questionnaire, which asked about prior contraceptive use, pregnancy history and CFTR modulator start and stop dates.Results: One hundred and fifty women with CF between the ages of 18-50 who were identified in the CFFPR completed the survey. Ninety-five percent (n=143) reported ever using contraception and 62% (n=93) were currently using contraception. Among 34% (n=51) of women who reported having ever been pregnant, 49% (n=25) had at least one unplanned pregnancy. Overall contraceptive use and type by age group (18-24 years vs. 25-50 years) between 2012 and 2016 were similar. Among CFTR modulator users, 70.2% reported currently using contraception, compared to 58.9% of women not on CFTR modulators (p=0.162). Two women of 48 CFTR modulator users reported unplanned pregnancies after modulator use initiation. One of these women was using combined hormonal contraceptives, the other was not using anything.Conclusion: Reproductive-aged women with CF reported similar rates of contraceptive use and unintended pregnancy to that of reproductive-aged women in the general United States (US) population. Unplanned pregnancy occurred among 4.2% of women using CFTR modulators, suggesting further research that evaluates modulator use and safety in reproductive-aged women is warranted. Linkage of these findings to CFFPR data is forthcoming and will be available at the NACFC presentation.",

Psychol., Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA Background: For the past decade, the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital has been addressing the mental health needs of our patients through a model that includes social work, a psychologist embedded in the CF clinic, and an inpatient behavioral medicine consultation service. Our center was supported by the CF Foundation (CFF) mental health coordination grant and has been implementing the CFF-recommended mental health guidelines since 2016. In order to better address the mental, emotional and behavioral needs of our patients and families, we began planning a multifaceted, multidisciplinary program to address observed gaps in our care model at the end of 2017. By centralizing, optimizing, and expanding our past and current efforts, we developed a new program: BETTER-CF (Behaviors, Emotions & Thoughts To Enhance Resilience in CF). The three cores of this program include innovations in data management, education, and clinical care.Initiatives: 1. Data Management: We worked with our internal application specialists to create accurate, real-time, psychosocial databases and reports that include mental health screens, standardized psychosocial assessments, psychiatric diagnoses, and key aspects from psychologist and social work notes. These reports are generated with information pulled from the EMR, and are being used in previsit planning, team communication, and clinical care (Moore S, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2018 ;53(S2):409).2. Education: We implemented a behavioral health education series for CF care team members. This case-based series has been incorporated into our center meetings, combines didactics and interactive learning, and is presented by various members of the care team (Filigno SS, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2018 ;53(S2):406). A needs assessment guided the development of this programming.3. Clinical Care: We began incorporating aforementioned data reports into our weekly previsit planning meetings, in addition to our weekly center discussion of current inpatient admissions. We also are in early stages of developing a novel inpatient care model with a focus on improved mental health support, continuity from outpatient care, and self-management; led by a psychologist in a newly-created position. Redesigning this milieu will require education and training, and buy-in from all members of the inpatient team as well as patients and families. Finally, we have worked with caregivers to develop our process for caregiver mental health screening and resource allocation in response to elevated scores.Next Steps: We will continue to test and expand the described program, as well as begin to incorporate new initiatives (e.g. incorporating adherence data into pre-visit planning). We ultimately foresee this program to be incorporated in all aspects of CF care, including outpatient visits, inpatient stays, and integrating into self-management at home. We anticipate a cultural change at our CF center that encourages every interaction with patients and families to be positive and therapeutic. Once the program is refined and optimized, we plan to spread our robust resources to other programs in our division and share our learnings with other CF centers. Aim: We aim to improve the identification of the need for increased psychosocial support for patients 3 to 11 years old. The process begins Introduction: It is recognised that among CF patients psychological and behavioural problems are common and varied (CF Trust, 2011) . The TIDES study (Quittner A, et al. Thorax. 2014 ;69:1090-7) reported a high incidence of anxiety and depression among CF patients >11 years (y) and their parents/carers (parents). Both recommend patients 12+ y and parents of patients aged 0+ y should be screened annually for psychological problems. This study aims to take up these recommendations and also to look at psychological well-being of patients >3 y.",

            "text": "Method: Over a 12-month period psychological screening was completed during CF annual review (AR). The PHQ9 (Spitzer R, et al. JAMA. 1999; 282:1737-44) and GAD7 (Spitzer R, et al. Arch Intern Med. 2006; 166:1092-7) were used to screen parents for symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition the SDQ (http://www.sdqinfo.com) was used: parents completed the SDQ for child aged 4-10 y; patients >10 y also completed a self-report SDQ. Information and the questionnaires were sent prior to AR and scored on the day.Results: Of 264 families sampled age was 0-17 y, mean 8 y and 125 (47%) were female. Of at least one parent and child, 189 (72%) completed all age appropriate measures, 28 (11%) completed some measures and 47 (18%) declined. PHQ9 and GAD7 data were provided by 70% of mothers and 47% of fathers; 190 with children <12 y, 74 >11 y. SDQ was completed by 72% of parents with children >3 y and 70% of children aged >10 y. Parents who completed questionnaires reported 9% anxiety and 7% depression in the moderate-severe range. Parent-rated concern on SDQ was 7-16% across the subscales, and in the self-reported 2-10%. Mothers reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (p=.002) and depression (p=.001) than fathers. Parents of patients >11 y were significantly more anxious (p=.04) and depressed (p=.01) than those of <12 y. There was no significant difference between the two age groups in SDQ emotional distress scores but parents of children >11 reported greater impact of challenges on their child (p=.02).Discussion: This study screened psychological well-being in 264 CF patients 0-17 y and their parents of a CF centre. Subject recruitment was high. Anxiety and depression reported by parents were lower than many studies including TIDES. Challenges for emotional well-being in patients both as reported by their parents and the patients (>11 y) indicated a lower incidence of psychological distress than other CF studies and is similar to the general population. Patients >10 y reported a lower incidence of problems than their parents did about them. Parents of patients <12 y reported themselves as significantly less anxious and depressed than those of >11 y. Annual monitoring will be continued to offer interventions to promote adherence to treatment and health-related quality of life. Further research to explore the reasons for the difference in the mood of parents of patients <12 y and those of older paediatric patients is indicated. Conclusions: The ABQ modules provide an individualized \"snapshot\" of the most common or difficult barriers to CF treatments. It takes only a few minutes to complete the ABQ-CF modules, which have 4 to 9 questions. This tool can be used in clinic to initiate a patient-centered conversation about what is \"getting in the way\" and lends itself to a brief, behavioral intervention to solve the barrier. Additional reliability and validity analyses will be performed with the ABQ-CF, medication possession ratios, and the CFQ-R Treatment Burden scale.Acknowledgments: Supported by: CF Foundation grants BARRI-ERS16PE0, SAWICK14PE1 and RIEKERT15PE0.",

We compared adolescents' and adults' reports of their treatments with the prescribed treatment plan (PTP) completed by the research coordinator.Methods: Adolescents and adults from 12 pediatric (PEDS) and 9 adult (ADULT) CF centers, participating in the Success with Therapies Research Consortium (STRC), completed demographics and the ABQ-CF (Adherence Barriers Questionnaire) on which they endorsed their treatments. The PTP was completed by the research coordinator via chart review. Eligibility criteria were: age 13+ years, diagnosed with CF, English speaking, on a chronic pulmonary medication, and no hospitalization expected in next 28 days.Results: 407 people were enrolled (PEDS=207; ADULT=200). Mean age PEDS=17.1 (SD=3.1) and ADULT=32.8 (SD=10.9), 50% were male, 85% were White non-Hispanic, and 30% had public/no health insurance. Mean FEV 1 percent predicted was PEDS = 84.4 (SD=20.2), ADULT = 64.2 (SD = 22.9). Overall, agreement was fairly good, with discrepancies (percent difference between patient endorsement vs PTP) ranging from a low of .50% (enzymes, ivacaftor) to a high of 12% (TOBI Podhaler) across ages. Agreement using Kappa coefficients (.70 criteria) indicated lowest convergence for vitamins and dornase alfa, with borderline-low kappas for TOBI Podhaler across centers. Next, we examined the magnitude of the discrepancies by clinic type and found significantly greater discordance for hypertonic saline for PEDS (8.2%) vs ADULT (2.5%) and greater discordance for colistin (ADULT = 7.0%; PEDS= 1.9%) and TOBI Podhaler (ADULT = 12%; PEDS = 4.4%) in ADULT vs PEDS centers (p's <.05). Across rates of discordance, patients reported they were not on a medication the clinic had prescribed.Conclusions: Overall, there was substantial agreement between patients and clinics on their prescribed regimen; however, there were several instances of participants not identifying a medication prescribed in the chart. Agreement was highest for enzymes and ivacaftor and lowest for vitamins, dornase alfa and TOBI Podhaler. Disagreements between adolescents and adults were found for hypertonic saline, with adolescents endorsing this less often than adults; fewer adults reported prescriptions for colistin and the Podhaler than adolescents. These results suggest that providing a written treatment plan to patients at each clinic visit, such as the PTP, would be useful for increasing patients' understanding of their regimen. Treatments under-reported by patients may be those with a greater number of barriers. Adherence was also lowest for hypertonic saline in a national study of adherence across ages (Quittner AL, et al. Chest. 2014; 146:142-51) . A key limitation: we did not evaluate patients' understanding of the frequency or dose of these treatments, which could reveal additional discrepancies. Data from the newly developed CF-Adherence Barriers Questionnaire (CF-ABQ) may provide more insight into reasons for poor adherence. and treatment of their own mental health, while also improving the care and treatment of our CF patients.Acknowledgments: Funding by CFF grants CC182-16 and CMHC182-15. Methods: Adult patients with CF were recruited from outpatient pulmonary clinics and inpatient units at the University of Alabama Hospital and Children's Hospital of Alabama. Total of 123 patients completed a baseline survey and 97 of them (79% retention) completed the same survey 6 months later. The surveys included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality and the Brief Symptom Inventory to measure depression symptoms. Correlations examined concurrent associations between sleep quality and depressive symptoms. Then, linear regressions predicted depressive symptoms at follow-up from sleep quality at baseline, controlling for FEV1.",

At both baseline and follow-up, better sleep quality was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (r=.49 and .35, p<.001). In the linear regression, poor sleep quality at baseline significantly predicted increased depression symptoms at follow-up (beta=.35, p=.001).Discussion: Better understanding of risk factors for depression in patients with CF may lead to interventions to prevent or predict the development of depression in this population. Since sleep quality may predict depression, screening for sleep quality may be helpful in identifying patients at risk for developing depression.Acknowledgments: Supported by Center for Palliative and Supportive Care, University of Alabama at Birmingham. We have observed that a subgroup of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) reports widespread chronic pain and fatigue that do not resolve with conventional CF specific treatment. Their symptoms appear similar to those that meet criteria for fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a centralized pain state in which the central nervous system is the origin or amplification of pain (Clauw D. JAMA. 2014; 311:1547) . Thus, people with fibromyalgia will feel more pain than would normally be expected from nociceptive causes. We used a standard FM measure to assess the chronic pain experienced by adults with cystic fibrosis and compared the results to those reported for patients with fibromyalgia.",

            "text": "Methods: We used an existing fibromyalgia survey that combines a Symptom Severity Index and Michigan Body Map. This survey reports out a total score on the FM symptom scale (FS) and subscores of chronic pain widespreadness (WPI) and severity (SS). A FS score \u226512 meets criteria for fibromyalgia. We added two qualifying questions to the standard FM survey to identify pain specifically related to abdominal and sinus disease in CF. The FM survey was offered to 24 consecutive patients during their annual outpatient physical therapy evaluation and to 12 patients during hospitalization for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation. One patient did not fully complete the survey and could not be scored.Results: The FS scores for the 35 patients who completed the study were normally distributed with a mean (SD) of 10.7 (6.7). Fourteen patients (40%) met FS criteria (\u226512) for fibromyalgia. Positive responses to the additional CF-specific questions regarding abdominal and sinus pain were widely distributed among the patients and not concentrated in the highest FS scoring group. The mean WPI score was 5.2 and mean SS was 5.6. The mean FS score for our subjects (10.7) was considerably higher than the mean reported for a comparison population of 16,273 patients presenting for elective surgery (5.4; See Figure) . Our patients whose scores met the FS criteria reported pain in more nonjoint areas than those who did not meet FS criteria, which is consistent with comparison of FM and non-FM populations (Lu L, et al. Arthritis Rheumatol. 2017 ;69(suppl 10);[abstract]).Conclusion: The FM survey results from our adult CF patients reveal a high level of widespread pain with 40% scoring in the range seen in patients with fibromyalgia. This frequency is much higher than the 2-8% reported for control populations. We suggest that this FM survey tool can be used to evaluate the widespread chronic pain that occurs in adults with CF and to measure the effects of treatment directed to alleviate the chronic pain. Introduction: For patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), indicators of physical health and disease severity are closely monitored by a team of health professionals at periodic clinic visits. Body mass index (BMI) and forced expiratory volume (FEV 1 ) are key metrics of health that guide therapeutic intervention. Because these health outcomes are strongly determined by patients' adherence to treatment regimen and adherence greatly varies across patients, it is important to examine factors that contribute to treatment adherence and health outcomes. One such factor is Health Locus of Control (HLC), which indicates the degree to which individuals believe their health is controlled by their own behavior vs external influences. HLC has three key dimensions: Internal (belief that one's actions affect one's health), Powerful Others (belief that powerful others like medical professionals affect one's health), and Chance (belief that one's health is influenced by chance; Wallston KA, et al. Health Educ Monogr.1978; 6:160-70) . Unique relationships have been identified between these dimensions of HLC and different health behaviors (Abbott J, et al. Thorax. 1996; 51:1233-8) . For instance, CF patients with higher Powerful Others HLC have been shown to have greater adherence to physiotherapy, pancreatic enzyme, and vitamin therapies. These particular behaviors have the potential to help maintain FEV 1 and BMI in CF patients (Mcllwaine MP, et al. Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2014; 20:613-7; Sinaasappel M, et al. J Cyst Fibros. 2002; 1:51-75) . This study examined whether key dimensions of HLC predict health outcomes in patients with CF.",

At baseline, each participant completed the Multidimensional HLC Scale (Wallston et al, 1978) , an 18-item measure that distinguishes three dimensions of HLC (Internal, Powerful Others, and Chance). BMI and FEV 1 scores were obtained from the CF Foundation registry for baseline and 6-month follow-up. Correlations and linear regressions tested whether the three HLC dimensions at baseline predicted BMI and FEV 1 at follow-up.Results: At baseline, average BMI was 23.8 (SD=5.4) and mean FEV 1 was 61.1% (SD=23.0%). Baseline Powerful Others HLC was positively correlated with follow-up BMI (r=.200, p=.034) and served as a unique predictor of higher follow-up BMI in the regression model (Beta=.213, p=.036) . No dimension of HLC predicted FEV 1 scores at follow-up.Discussion: In previous work, Powerful Others HLC predicted dietary maintenance in CF patients (Abbott et al, 1996) , which may explain why this dimension predicted higher BMI at follow-up in the present study. Interestingly, Internal HLC predicted better diet in community samples (Cheng C, et al. Health Psychol Rev. 2016; 10:460-77 Background: Transition into adulthood and self-care is a critical time for young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). This stage of adolescent development, in addition to the high treatment burden of CF and the possibility of switching care providers, has been shown to induce fear and anxiety in young adults (Tierney S, et al. Int J Nurs Stud. 2013; 50(6) :738-46). While transition may be emotional, little is known regarding the presence of clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety leading up to and shortly after transfer to adult care. To better understand the effects of transition and its potential impact on mental health we investigated whether young adults with CF experience increased symptoms of depression or anxiety surrounding healthcare transition.Method: Patients attending the Emory+Children's pediatric clinic who were within two years of their scheduled transfer to the adult CF clinic (Pre-Transfer cohort) were matched with a similar age group of patients who had already transferred to the adult clinic (Post-Transfer cohort). Anxiety and depression screening was performed at least annually on all patients utilizing the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ9) respectively. The results of annual screenings collected in the calendar year prior and after transition were used. Of 23 subjects in the Pre-Transfer cohort, 12 had screenings both before and after adult care transfer. Continuous categories such as age, PHQ9 score, GAD7 Score and time to/from transfer were compared with unpaired, 2-tailed t-test. Categorical data such as sex was compared with chi-squared test. Significance was determined at p \u2264 0.05.Results: There were no differences between Pre-(n=23) and Post-Transfer (n=10) cohorts in terms of age (19.7\u00b10.60 vs. 19.17\u00b11.03), sex (40% female vs. 52% female), time to/from transfer, GAD7 (4.38\u00b15.58 vs. 2.7\u00b12.21) or PHQ9 (5.23\u00b15.93 vs. 3.4\u00b14.09) scores. It is notable that GAD7 and PHQ9 scores were relatively low in both groups with the average scores in all categories below the meaningful clinical cut off (< 5), with the exception of Pre-Transfer cohort PHQ9 scores (5.23\u00b15.93).When comparing GAD7 and PHQ9 scores in the Pre-Transfer group before and after their own transfer of care, there was a nonstatistical trend towards decreased scores following transfer (PHQ9 -5.23\u00b15.93 vs. 3.22\u00b14.12 before and after transfer, GAD7 -4.38\u00b15.58 vs. 3.72\u00b14.51). Again, individual subject's before and after transfer screening scores were generally low. Only 25% of subjects had an elevated PHQ9 score prior to transfer and 33% of subjects had an elevated GAD-7 score prior to transfer.Conclusion: Given the extent of other contributing factors it is difficult to determine what role healthcare transition plays in the context of mental health and whether PHQ9 and/or GAD7 scores tend to normalize once young adults with CF are well established in the adult care environment. Small cohort sizes limit the power of the analysis in this study and suggest an opportunity for continued exploration. Introduction: Depression in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including a steeper rate of decline in lung function (Frederick C, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017; 52:500) and increased mortality risk (Schechter MS, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol 2017; 52:404-5) . Further, a recently published study found major depression as a significant risk factor for early death in the general population and this association persists over long periods of time (Gilman SE, et al. CMAJ. 2017;189:E1304-10). The goal of this retrospective review was to describe rates and patterns of depression in individuals with CF that died since our center designed and implemented a standardized process for ongoing depression screening with interventions tailored to the severity of depression.",

All patients with depression data were included.Results: Nine (70%) of the 13 patients who died met the inclusion criteria, having at least one mental health screening assessment available for review. One patient was not screened secondary to dementia and three did not screen secondary to illness severity at the time of screen initiation. Three of nine patients who were screened died post-lung transplant (LT). The average age at death was 42 years in the LT group screened. No patients who underwent LT screened positive for depression. Four patients in the screened non-LT group (80% non-LT group, 44.4% of all deceased patients screened) met criteria for clinically significant depressive symptoms (2 mild, 1 moderate, 1 severe). Two patients endorsed suicidal ideation. Of the individuals with depression 50% had recurrent depression (N=2) and 50% had chronic depression (N=2). The median/average age of death of individuals without LT was 27 years and 27.25 years respectively.Discussion: Our limited data support an association between depression with rates that are higher than the rates of individuals living with CF. The average and median age of death in individuals who died and screened positive for depression is less than the median age of survival in all individuals with CF aligning with previous research showing early mortality in individuals with CF that died without receiving a lung transplant. It is unclear whether depression predisposed patients to an earlier mortality risk or if worsening health increased the rates of depression. This is likely a multifactorial process however with this small compelling set of data and significant mortality implications, more longitudinal research is needed to optimize screening, evaluation and treatment of mental health in individuals with CF. The association between pediatric chronic disease and caregiver (CG) anxiety or depression has been well documented. Annual screening for \u22651 primary CG of children with CF is recommended given the 2-3-fold increased risk for depression and anxiety in this population (Quittner AL, et al. Thorax. 2014; 69:1090-7) . Risk factors within CF-CG cohorts and correlation of CG mental health with patient health status are less known. Driscoll and coworkers (Pediatr Pulmonol. 2009; 44:784-92; J Pediatr Psychol. 2010; 35:814-22) found increased depression among female CF-CGs as patient lung function decreased, elevated CF-CG depression with increased family stress and lack of employment, and no association between patient zBMI and CG depression. The first year of CG screening in a southeastern pediatric CF center is reviewed with attention to associations between CG anxiety and depressive symptoms and CF health outcomes and CG employment.",

            "text": "Methods: CGs voluntarily completed an electronic PHQ-8 and GAD-7 at their child's visit. Supportive feedback and self-care tips were given to all. CGs with elevated scores in the moderate-severe range were encouraged to seek diagnostic assessment and treatment. Pearson's correlations were used to examine relations of log-transformed CG screen results with child health outcomes of FEV1, BMI z-score (zBMI) and number of hospitalizations in the past year. Household employment status was reviewed when available.Results: A total of 54 CGs were screened. CGs were mothers (72%), fathers (15%), custodial extended family (6%), grandparent (5%), and foster parent (2%). Mean CG age was 37.5 years (9.1). Mean CG scores were 4.8 (PHQ-8) and 4.2 (GAD-7); 20 (37%) CGs had elevated PHQ scores (score \u22655) while 19 (35%) had elevated GAD-7 scores (score \u22655). CG elevations for both anxiety and depression symptoms were strongly associated (rho=0.83, p<0.001) with 16 CGs \u22655 on both screens. Patient FEV1, number of hospitalizations, and CG employment outside the home were not significantly correlated with CG depression/anxiety. Child zBMI was significantly positively correlated with increased caregiver depression/anxiety symptoms (rho= 0.26 (log-PHQ-8), rho= 0.28 (log-GAD-7), p<0.05).Conclusions: These data provide insight into associations of CG mental health with patient health outcomes in our care center. Rates of CG depressive and anxious symptoms are consistent with published rates. Both CG depression and anxiety increased with higher patient zBMI in our center, which differs from previous published data. Additionally we found no association of FEV1, hospitalizations or employment with CG symptoms. Overall, few studies have examined health outcomes in relation to CG depression and anxiety. Further investigations should be conducted with larger sample sizes, as bi-directional impacts of CG mental health and patient health could be important in CF care. Maintaining child nutritional status and goal weights is a primary focus of pediatric CF care, and perhaps parents who have been persistently working on these goals experience increased stress. This study highlights the need for continued CG screening with future attention to factors that increase CG risk and associations with pediatric CF outcomes. Methods: We administered surveys to 3 stakeholder groups: a) individuals with CF, b) caregivers, and c) CF clinicians/care team members via the CF Foundation Community Voice web platform and clinician listservs. CF individuals and caregivers were asked: 1) if they thought CF clinicians should receive more training in PC; 2) whether availability of lung transplant for CF affects PC delivery; and 3) further thoughts. CF clinicians were asked: 1) how they would describe PC in the context of CF care, 2) how the availability of lung transplant affects how PC fits into CF care; and 3) further thoughts. All open-ended responses were read and analyzed by two qualitative researchers.",

            "text": "Results: Seventy individuals with CF, 100 CF caregivers, and 350 CF clinicians responded to our survey. Within each group there was variation regarding what PC is, who should administer it, and when. Among all groups, several participants equated PC with end-of-life care. As stated by a CF participant, PC is \"not something really talked about at my stage of CF.\" Others saw CF-specific PC as \"an integral part of the journey for our CF care.\" Additionally, caregivers highlighted their own PC needs: \"The emotional needs of all involved need to be addressed more fully.\" Most participants believed that PC was appropriate and necessary for lung transplant, stating that \"Palliative care could help patients better understand transplant, and also help the care team get patients to transplant, and help them be more successful after the transplant.\" However, several participants perceived PC and transplant as mutually exclusive specifically linking PC to opioid use: \"The biggest barrier [to PC for lung transplant] is the use of narcotics to alleviate pain.\" When specifically asked about who should deliver PC services, clinicians' responses also varied with some stating that they \"prefer to leave that discussion to a specialist\" and others stating \"Basic palliative care is the responsibility of every CF provider at every point in the disease.\"Conclusion: Among CF stakeholders, there are varied beliefs and practices about PC as it relates to people with CF. As a result, many people with CF may not be receiving PC that is appropriate to their needs across the spectrum of disease. Education and outreach are needed in order to increase access to quality PC for individuals with CF. Fibrosis provides care to approximately 180 adults. CF Foundation-accredited care centers have coordinated efforts to provide on-site preventative screening, evidenced-based, focused therapies, medication management and community referrals as indicated. We have implemented annual screening since 2014 with the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 as clinically indicated. Collaborative team discussions have focused on the utility and appropriateness of general screening tools such as the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 for the CF population. Given that the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for both depressive and anxiety disorder requires significant functional impairment, we sought to assess the relationship between self-reported functional impairment and scores from GAD-7 and PHQ-9 screening.",

Screening results were included in this study only if both total score and self-reported level of impairment were recorded. Patients were tested at routine, nonsick visits. Primary outcomes were total scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 as well as self-reported levels of functional impairment.Results: Out of 276 total visits, 207 (75%) contained complete screening records that included both total scores and self-rated functional impairment for both GAD-7 and PHQ-9. The severity breakdown of PHQ-9 scores was 56% (115 patients (pts)) minimal, 24% (49 pts) mild, 12% (24 pts) moderate, 8% (16 pts) moderately severe and 1% (3 pts) severe. The severity breakdown of GAD-7 scores was 61% (127 pts) minimal, 18% (37 pts) mild, 12% (25 pts) moderate, and 9% (18 pts) severe. For both anxiety and depression, the majority of patients with minimal symptoms reported no functional impairment (75% and 73%, respectively). For those with mild symptoms, 76% with depressive symptoms and 81% of those with anxiety reported being \"somewhat\" impaired. For those with moderate depressive symptoms, 13% reported no impairment, while 42% reported \"somewhat,\" 38% reported \"very,\" and the remaining 8% reported extreme impairment. Patients with moderately severe depressive symptoms reported 6% \"not at all,\" 31% somewhat, 38% very, and 23% extremely impaired. Patients with severe depressive symptoms equally reported being somewhat, very, or individual sessions allowed for tailoring each session to meet the needs of the individual family. Future plans include revisiting the possibility of telehealth group for parents to allow parents to learn from each other's experiences and foster increased social support. Acknowledgments: Research supported by a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Background: Early development of the InformedChoices decision aid (DA) for CF advance care planning involved exploration of CF adults' information needs regarding invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and lung transplant (LT). We learned that CF adults felt it was necessary, for their own decisions, to hear personal stories by other CF people about their own experiences. In direct response, we collected CF adult and caregiver narratives about IMV and LT to include in the DA. We present results from analysis of the narratives.Methods: We recruited participants from CF clinics at Northwell Health, Univ. Pennsylvania and CFF Community Voice. Interviews were conducted in person or by web-conference. Open-ended questions focused on: 1) process (leading up to, during and after IMV or LT); 2) information seeking; and 3) feelings about experiences. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis.Result: Fifteen participants were recruited (10 CF adults and 5 caregivers); Participants were able to give personal accounts of experiences undergoing IMV and/or LT. Some described IMV in detail, with one person stating that \"It felt like a railroad track going down my throat\"; others described the moments prior to transplant surgery, and post-op recovery: \"I had to relearn how to walk. I remember getting very weak because I couldn't pass my swallow test, so they wouldn't let me eat.\" Others described their depression post-transplant: \"I don't know if I could have been prepared for the depression I felt, especially with the complications. It felt so debilitating because the thing I went in to have surgery for was fixed but now I had a new problem.\" Caregivers described the loss of their loved one from chronic rejection or the decision to decline IMV: \"It wasn't about not wanting a breathing tube, it was the futility of the intervention.\" Participants also discussed topics clinicians never brought up, including ECMO or needing additional organ transplant. IMV due to respiratory failure was rarely discussed with 4/6 participants who experienced this having \"no idea it could happen.\" Several LT recipients brought up their organ donors with 2 of them developing close relationships with their donor's family. Importantly, most LT recipients stated that they would not change their decision to undergo transplant despite complications: \"It's still been a wonderful five years -look at the things that I couldn't do before. It's given me a whole new life, I can breathe!\" Conclusion: Given these results, decision making for CF adults about late-stage care can be enhanced by hearing stories from others who have had similar experiences, especially because these experiences often cover topics not disucssed in clinic. By including narratives in our DA, we hope to offer CF adults the opportunity to learn from the experiences of others. Health, Univ North Carolina Chapel Hil, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Introduction: Routine visits to a primary care physician (PCP) allow for symptom management, anticipatory guidance, and wellness checks. Yet according to the CDC, in 2015, 23.3% of all adults ages 18-44 did not see a PCP for even a single visit. As the average age of cystic fibrosis patients rises and more patients enter higher risk categories for diseases like breast and colon cancer, anticipatory guidance is even more necessary. Because CF adults are already tasked with the burden of having frequent subspecialty visits, many do not maintain a relationship with a PCP but instead identify their pulmonary subspecialist as their primary care physician. However, physicians trained as pulmonary subspecialists may fail to implement important routine health screenings.Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed for a convenience sample of 92 adult CF patients, including all patients over the age of 40 followed in an adult CF clinic. Topics of interest were identified from the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendations for Primary Care Practice. Charts were abstracted for grade A and B recommendations from the USPSTF to identify a pattern of missed screening opportunities.Results: In 59% of cases, the patient had no PCP identified, or the primary pulmonologist was listed as the PCP. Out of those with a separate PCP identified (38 patients), only 61% (23 patients) demonstrated evidence of specialist communication with the PCP. Out of 37 female patients who met age criteria (age >40 years) for screening mammography, only 8 (22%) were up to date on screening. 51 women were within the recommended age range for cervical cancer screening, yet only 12% (6 patients) had documentation of meeting USPSTF screening recommendations. Of the 92 patients reviewed, 50 met CF Foundation (CFF) guidelines criteria for screening colonoscopy. Of these, 24 patients (48%) had received a screening colonoscopy at some point in the past, with 19 patients (38%) having received testing in accordance with either CFF guidelines or the USPSTF. Due in large part to recent concerted quality improvement efforts by the CF team, only 6% of the included patients had not been screened for depression. Only 3% of patients had not been screened for diabetes.Conclusions: Collaboration between specialists and PCPs provides the most comprehensive care for patients. Most physicians would agree that maintaining up to date knowledge in both general internal medicine and subspecialty care is challenging; further, physicians who identify as a subspecialist may not see it in their realm of practice to perform primary care screening activities. In a sampling of CF adults seen at a major academic institution, many of the screening activities that a generalist routinely performs, such as breast cancer evaluations and sexually transmitted infection counseling, were missing. This suggests that these patients likely felt they are receiving comprehensive health care by their pulmonologist, even when missing several crucial screening examinations. Notably, screening rates were much higher when the complication or disease in question was specifically associated with CF, such as diabetes, depression screening, and colonoscopy.",

Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; 3. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA Introduction: A growing population of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) has emerged in recent decades. Although social support has been linked to a variety of mental and physical health outcomes in those with and without chronic illness, this construct has rarely been studied in the adult CF population. The current study examines both predictors and outcomes associated with social support in adults with CF. Based on previous research, it was hypothesized that those who are older, male, who have less income and education, who are not married or employed, and who have lower FEV 1 scores and more pulmonary exacerbations would have less social support. Further, it was hypothesized that individuals who report lower social support would have poorer mental and physical health as well as treatment activity and disease-specific health-related quality of life.Methods: Participants in the study included 250 adults with CF who took part in an eleven-wave longitudinal study known as the Project on Adult Care in Cystic Fibrosis (PAC-CF). Participants were administered a battery of measures including a social support evaluation (Interpersonal",

Univ (2):377-81) was sent to CF program directors (PDs) and APPs and compared to 2009 survey data to determine workforce gaps, APP scope of practice and training.Results: Responses were received from 124 PDs and 107 APPs. Of the PDs, 93 employed APPs in their programs. Reasons for APPs included job appropriate for APP (61%), service expansion (66%) and physician shortage (51%). Of the 56% of PDs recruiting physicians, 80% reported difficulty recruiting. The three qualities which APPs reported most important in a job are practicing at the top scope of practice, collaboration with physicians and schedule/work hours. Sixty-three percent of APPs serve leadership roles including QI leadership, CF clinic coordinator, registry coordinator, newborn screening, among others. Sixty-four percent of APPs practice at their top scope of practice. Reasons preventing APPs from practicing at the top scope of practice include lack of other staffing, poor understanding of APP role, PD responsibility delegation and hospital regulations. Only 10% of PDs report that they do not plan to use APPs in the future. Varying state, hospital, insurance and program regulations are barriers to APP billing and independent practice. Based on both surveys, training for APPs in CF is mostly on the job which 70% of the APPs felt was adequate, but 97% of APPs felt a more formal training program would be beneficial. PDs and APPs prefer the following training formats: online modules (40% PDs/48% APPs), year-long mentorship with senior APP (39% PDs/42% APPs), 3-month (40% PDs/39% APPs) or 1-month in-person fellowship (15% PDs/30% APPs).Discussion: APPs are an important part of CF clinical care teams. The care provided by APPs fills a gap in physician coverage and is uniquely tailored to a chronic care model due to the nature of APP training. The taskforce performed a literature search to evaluate current fellowship training opportunities for APPs new to practice or a particular specialty. Discussion is underway to develop a more formal training opportunity for CF APPs.Acknowledgment: Supported in part by the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research grant (UL1 TR000445 from NCATS/ NIH).",

The Cystic Fibrosis Center, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, New York, NY, USA Introduction: Genetic counseling in the cystic fibrosis (CF) clinic began in 1971 and has been repeatedly shown to provide value to patients, families, and CF clinicians, but inclusion of genetic counseling services as part of a multidisciplinary CF clinic has not been widely adopted. We sought to investigate the attitudes and barriers to provision of genetic counseling in CF clinics.Methods: Center directors and clinic coordinators at US CF Foundation-accredited CF centers were surveyed using a web-based tool distributed via email listserv.Results: The survey was completed by 125 center directors and clinic coordinators. Eighty-nine percent of respondents indicated that genetic counselors (GCs) provide a unique service to CF patients and their families and 84% indicated that GCs provide a valuable service in the CF center. Of clinics involving a GC as part of the CF team, 85% \"strongly recommend\" or \"recommend\" this relationship for all CF centers. Overall, 79% of respondents indicated that GCs at their institution had a \"high level of understanding of CF\"; however, when intragroup differences were examined, it was noted that 100% of those whose CF teams included a GC agreed with this statement, compared to 42% who indicated no routine GC involvement with their CF team. Involvement of a GC in CF newborn screening (NBS) follow-up was also examined, as nearly all states' processes include DNA analysis. However, nearly 40% of pediatric respondents indicated that their CF center does not regularly utilize or refer to GCs as part of NBS follow-up. Of those who do, 78% indicated that GCs improve efficiency of their NBS follow-up procedures, but differences were noted between groups: 94% of clinic coordinators indicated that GCs improved NBS follow-up efficiency vs. 65% of center directors. While only 39% of respondents indicated that their CF center staff has the time to provide genetic counseling regarding CF NBS, further analysis showed differing opinions between the groups: 29% of clinic coordinators indicated that their staff has time to provide genetic counseling vs. 50% of center directors. Barriers to the involvement of GCs and provision of genetic counseling services were identified through specific survey questions and from 65 open-ended responses and included: cost/benefit; demonstration of expertise and knowledge of CF; accessibility (due to scheduling or geographical constraints); and perception of need for a GC's services.Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests that center directors and center coordinators that have an engaged GC believe that genetic counselors provide a unique and valuable service to CF patients and their families, have a high level of understanding of CF, and are accessible to their patients. Those who do not work closely with GCs are more likely to report a negative view of genetic counselors' value, knowledge, and accessibility. Understanding the relationship between the CF centers' perceptions of access and referral patterns may play a key role in improving the connections between GCs and CF centers, and further exploration of the barriers to including GCs as part of the CF team may provide insights into the variability in practices among CF centers.",

Breathing Institute, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA; 3. Pediatrics, Univ. of CO School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, USA Background: Adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) report high levels of depression and anxiety, with prevalence as high as 50% as compared to up to 17.5% among healthy counterparts. Unaddressed mental health (MH) concerns have been associated with poorer health outcomes. While the CF Foundation has invested in integrating MH into CF Centers, barriers still exist for those with CF to receive effective interventions to treat MH. Referrals to community MH providers also remain challenging. This study aims to 1) confirm the relationship between MH concerns and health outcomes in our CF center, 2) examine caregiver perceptions of adolescent MH concerns and barriers to community referrals, and 3) explore the possibility of whether frequency of contact with CF MH provider is correlated with changes in MH symptoms, as well as whether this relationship influences overall health outcomes.Methods: MH screening data (PHQ-9, GAD 7) from February 2015 to August 2016 (n=145) were analyzed to evaluate differences in lung function and demographic characteristics among patients with elevated scores (\u22655) as compared to those without concern for depression/anxiety. An online survey was administered to caregivers of patients with elevated screening PICC consult team is for inpatient line placement only, they are unavailable after 1600, and no other options are available except for a peripheral line. This delay in care was an issue for both patients and providers. For many patients peripheral lines are not an option due to poor venous access. Currently patients wait in clinic for admission from 4-10 hours with no IV access.Objective: To improve the time from admission to the administration of first IV antibiotic dose.Methods: A multidisciplinary conference was held with the PICC consult team, CF provider and CF nurse to discuss methods to improve time from PICC insertion to initiation of IV antibiotics.Results: It was agreed that the PICC consult team would place the lines in clinic for CF patients being admitted for a CF exacerbation and IV antibiotics. Once admission is identified, the PICC team is notified and an order is placed for the PICC line. The PICC team inserts the line in the patient's clinic room. This process was initiated January 1, 2018 and since initiation, 100% of PICC lines were placed in the clinic while the patient waits for an inpatient bed. Due to implementing our new process the time from admission to IV antibiotics has decreased from an average of 8 hours and 50 minutes to 1 hour and 47 minutes. As well our patients verbalize an increased satisfaction with the new process.Conclusion: Since initiation of this process January 1, 2018 patient care has become more streamlined and we have greater patient satisfaction. Inpatient staff have verbalized that PICC insertion prior to admission has allowed for staff to utilize their time more efficiently. Based on the success of this process the adult center plans to look at additional aspects of care to identify areas that can be streamlined to improve patient care. The next step in this project addresses the need to start the IV antibiotics in clinic while waiting on an inpatient bed.

            "text": "Results: Responses were received from 121 people (62 adult patients, 58 parents/guardians and 1 spouse). Sixty-seven percent reported APPs providing care in their current CF program and 19% did not know if an APP was present. Of those who have access to APPs, 88% have received care by an APP. Clinical care provided by an APP was most commonly in the settings of routine (71%) and sick (60.5%) CF care although hospitalizations (33%) and hospital follow-ups (34%) were reported. In addition, 15% reported research study visits provided by APPs. Seventy-four percent of patients and families are comfortable receiving care from an APP although 81% are not comfortable with only an APP providing their care. Comments reported preference for a physician physically seeing the patient at least occasionally. The majority felt their APP would contact a collaborating physician to discuss complicated patients or concerns outside of an APP scope of practice with only 17% reporting less confidence that this communication would occur. Insurance coverage was reported to cover APP care by 54% of respondents, however 46% reported that they did not know if insurance covered this care.Discussion: The overall experience with APPs in CF programs as reported by patients and families is a positive one although many report they would still want a physician to physically see them or their family member at least on occasion. Many patients and families reported not knowing if APPs are involved in their care, so further education of the CF community is indicated.Acknowledgments Background: Due to a consistent incidence of intravenous piggyback infusion (IVPB) errors cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are placed at a higher risk of complications compared to other patients. Nurses caring for CF patients on the Advanced Pulmonary Care Unit (APU) give between 10 to 20 IVPBs, primarily antibiotics, in a twelve-hour shift. IVPB medications left clamped had been an ongoing problem on the APU with 35 reported cases of IVPB left clamped from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. IVPB antibiotics left clamped can cause anaphylaxis in desensitized patients, an increase in antibiotic resistance, increased length of stay with an approximate cost of $1040.00 per day, and poor satisfaction in our patients, caregivers and physician partners.Objective: The purpose of this process change is to eliminate IVPB infusions from remaining clamped during IVPB setup and administration. In addition this change would increase patient, caregiver and physician satisfaction and prevent negative impacts due to IVPB left clamped.Method: A multidisciplinary team worked to improve the process of administering IVPB medications left clamped, by developing a \"no clamp method\" (NCM) when using IVPB tubing to administer medications. To ensure compliance of process change, registered nurses (RN) were individually educated and signed a contract regarding RN's agreement to use NCM. Post-implementation was done by tracking IVPBs left clamped, occasional audits of RNs using the new process and monthly reminders to RNs.Conclusion: The APU has had less occurrences since beginning NCM. In 2016 there were 35 IVPBs left clamped reported compared to 16 cases in 2017. In November of 2017 there was a spike of 4 cases. Audits and reeducation was done with a decrease back to a baseline of 2 or less cases a month. This process change has helped our team establish a comprehensive way to reduce IVPBs left clamped. This has resulted in safer practice for patients, and an increase in satisfaction for all parties.",

Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham, Hoover, AL, USA Background: With the life expectancy of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) doubling over the last two decades, it is critical that healthcare providers address both quantity and quality of life. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) encompasses physical, social, psychological, and functional aspects of daily living and how CF impacts each one. Women with CF consistently report having an overall poorer quality of life across international studies, but the cause of the gender difference is unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore gender differences in HRQoL and then build upon those results to better understand gender-specific facilitators and barriers to HRQoL.Methods: Gender-specific facilitators and barriers to HRQoL were explored using a sequential explanatory mixed methods design. The sample included 123 adults with CF who were recruited within a tertiary care center in southeast United States. Data collected included the CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), which is a disease-specific HRQoL questionnaire, a demographics form, and CF Foundation Patient Registry data. The CFQ-R has 12 separately scored domains of HRQoL (physical functioning, body image, social functioning, health perceptions, respiratory symptoms, treatment burden, emotional functioning, role functioning, vitality, eating problems, digestive symptoms, and weight). Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better HRQoL. The CFQ-R scores and descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS Statistical Software v. 23. A subsample of 15 men and 15 women completed a 30-45 minute, semi-structured interview to build upon the survey results and described gender-specific facilitators and barriers to HRQoL. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Braun and Clarke's method of thematic analysis and NVivo 11 software.Results: Fifty-seven men and 66 women with CF, aged 19-67 were included in the quantitative analyses. Though significance was not reached (p< 0.05), women reported a better HRQoL compared to men in the areas of body image, weight, and digestive symptoms. In the remaining nine areas, women reported a poorer HRQoL than men, with statistically significant differences in the areas of physical functioning (p = 0.02), social functioning (p = 0.03), emotional functioning (p = 0.02), and weight (p = 0.02). Five main themes emerged from the qualitative data that described facilitators and barriers to HRQoL: 1) Biological and Physiological Factors; 2) External Factors; 3) Functional Status; 4) Perceptions of Preferences, Values, and Mental Health; and 5) Perceived Symptom Status. Facilitators and barriers specific to men were associated with assuming male roles, utilizing counseling resources, and being open with others about having CF whereas, women reported not wanting to be labeled by others, being content with thinness, and social media.Conclusions: Factors that contribute to HRQoL are complex and diverse. These results show where the gender differences in HRQoL occur and provide insight into potential facilitators and barriers that could be used to improve the HRQoL of adults with CF.

Children's Hospital of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA Background: Pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are a frequent cause of hospital admissions for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and intravenous (IV) antibiotics are part of the standard of care for PEx. Patient /Family satisfaction surveys at our pediatric institution identified complaints due to a delay in IV access and first antibiotic administration upon admission in our CF patients. Because this delay could negatively impact quality of care and outcomes, we examined our process of obtaining IV access and timing of first antibiotic dose.Objective: To improve timeliness of peripheral IV (PIV) or port access and administration of the first IV antibiotic dose within two (2) hours from time of admission.Methods: A literature review was done to determine a standard time frame for first antibiotic administration in CF, but little is published. A process map was developed to delineate the steps involved in admitting a patient for a PEx. A chart audit over a one-year period was performed; data collected included patient origin, presence of an admission letter from a provider, arrival time to hospital unit, timing of antibiotic order and verification, time and type of IV access, type of RN obtaining access, and time the first antibiotic was given. Nurses were surveyed regarding barriers to initiating IV antibiotic therapy. Potential barriers included lack of supplies, patient/family obstacles, no orders from medical team, lack of time or ability to start IV, difficulty obtaining IV access itself, antibiotic unavailable from pharmacy, and prioritizing admissions for CF patients experiencing PEx. Two plan-do-study-act (PDSA) tests of change included (1) making a \"PIV Kit\" including necessary supplies for starting IVs and (2) changing the admission order set to include an order to obtain IV access Results: In the baseline audit, time from admission to IV access (via PIV or port) ranged from 0.38 to 19.42 hours (hrs) with a median of 2.53 hrs. The time from admission to first antibiotic dose ranged from 0.9 hrs to 22.80 hrs with a median of 3.80 hrs. During the PIV kit trial, the time from admission to PIV placement ranged from 0.52 hrs to 5.3 hrs, with a median of 2.2 hrs; and the time from admission to first antibiotic dose ranged from 1.23 hrs to 6.17 hrs, with a median of 3.45 hrs. After the admission order set modification, the time from admission to IV access ranged from 0.23 hrs to 4.03 hrs, with a median of 2.33 hrs. Time from admission to first antibiotic dose ranged from 1.87 hrs to 6.32 hrs, with a median of 3.28 hrs. These changes were not significant.Conclusions: After two PDSA cycles, we observed a small but not significant improvement in overall median time to first antibiotic administration on admission. There is significant variability in timing, and we are not meeting our goal of 2 hours or less in many patients. The PIV kit seemed to have the largest impact on timing to IV access. Continued data collection is underway to determine further areas for improvement. Results from the nurse survey also identified opportunities for education surrounding the importance of timely IV access and antibiotics in CF exacerbations and impact on patient care and satisfaction. Background: Most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who require inpatient admission to Cincinnati Children's Hospital are hospitalized on our Complex Pulmonary Unit (A7C1). Several years ago, this unit implemented nurse-led rounds in order to improve nurse-physician communication, patient care, and patient-family experience. However, we found that bedside nurses often could not be present at morning rounds due to the timing of many other patient care needs, which conflicted with the unit morning rounding time. We also found that participation in morning rounds was not always a priority for bedside nurses, since they did not appreciate the value of their participation.",

            "text": "Objective: To increase the participation of bedside nurses during morning multidisciplinary rounds.Methods: Members of our A7C1 Operational Excellence (OpEx) team met in November 2017 to review and improve our NRC Health (National Research Corporation) data regarding nurse-physician communication. There was consensus among team members that participation of bedside nurses during morning rounds was a key driver toward improving nurse-physician communication and patient-family experience. Using the \"5 Whys,\" we determined that the 8:40 AM start time for morning rounds conflicted with the timing of many patient assessments, treatments and medications, and precluded consistent involvement of the bedside nurse. We noticed that bedside nurses were often more able to participate on Tuesdays, when our unit morning rounds started at 9 AM, due to hospital-wide Grand Rounds. We hypothesized that shifting our rounding start time to 9 AM would enable more bedside nurses to participate in morning rounds. Initially, we shifted our rounding time from 8:40 AM to 9:00 AM. However, our resident team felt that they did not have enough time after rounds to complete patient care activities before their didactic lectures. Consequently, we changed our rounding start time to 8:50 AM. Through the \"5 Whys,\" our A7C1 OpEx team also determined that bedside nurse engagement was a key driver toward improving participation in morning rounds. To improve bedside nurse engagement in morning rounds, another intervention that we trialed was the use of a checklist which gave the bedside nurse ownership of specific information to be shared with the team during morning rounds.Results: Qualitative feedback from A7C1 nurses was excellent. Bedside nurses were able to complete most patient care tasks before the start of morning rounds, and better able to participate in nurse-led morning rounds. Furthermore, bedside nurses felt that their contributions during rounds were appreciated and valued. Quantitative measurement of bedside nurse presence on morning rounds during implementation of these interventions with compliant caregivers to have limited stores of pancreatic enzymes in the patient room safe. Easy access for self-administration of enzymes was allowed rather than the traditional method of nurse administration. Utilizing the primary nurse concept with these CF admissions allowed patient/nurse bonding and familiarity with food preferences, motivational factors, and compliance issues, suggestions/recommendations. Methods: One month post-implementation, a satisfaction questionnaire was administered at the end of hospitalization for participating CF patients. The study measured patient level of satisfaction with immediate access to bedside pancreatic enzymes versus traditional nurse administration. The study also measured primary nurse preference between the traditional methodology and self-administration of bedside enzymes. The results were analyzed using the 5-point Likert satisfaction scale with 5 being very satisfied, 1 being not satisfied.Results: A total of 14 primary nurses were surveyed one month post-implementation, with 12 preferring bedside enzymes and 2 preferring traditional nurse administration. Of the 11 CF patient survey participants, 9 experienced a decrease in wait time from the traditional 10-20 minutes to 5-10 minutes. Two patients had less than 5-minute wait times with self-administration. Eight of 11 patients using the new practice, scored a \"5,\" very satisfied, or a \"3,\" satisfied.Conclusion: Hospitalized pediatric CF patients had higher levels of satisfaction with self-administration of pancreatic enzymes. Immediate access to enzymes stored in the room's safe increases their autonomy and parallels a self-care practice usually performed at home. Additionally, a decrease in wait times optimizes nutritional growth and healing while hospitalized. 4 1. Pulmonary Medicine, Yale, Madison, CT, USA; 2. Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT, USA; 3. Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA; 4. Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) represents a relatively small patient population that is medically complex and requires a multidisciplinary team approach to provide effective care. As the CF population ages, the number of hospital admissions will increase, due to a larger patient pool and an increase in disease complications. As such, inpatient nursing staff must have a basic understanding of the disease and its medical management to provide satisfactory care. This was identified as a programmatic need when adult patient admissions were centralized to one floor at Yale New Haven Hospital. A survey was administered to inpatient nurses intended to identify gaps in knowledge, and to inform future education interventions to ultimately improve patient care and patient experience.Methods: A review of Pubmed and Cochrane databases was conducted using keywords: inpatient, guidelines, management, nursing assessment tool, and cystic fibrosis, to identify patient-centered perceptions of inpatient care. Potential gaps in nursing (RN) knowledge were identified based on these results. To assess RN knowledge regarding CF, a questionnaire in use by our CF center's pediatric program was adapted for use in the adult inpatient unit at Yale New Haven Hospital. The 20-question survey consisted of questions across 5 disciplines: Medical Provider, Respiratory Therapy, Physical Therapy, Mental Health and Nutrition. The questionnaire was administered to 30 floor nurses on the floor in August 2017.Results: 13 out of 30 nurses successfully completed the assessment. Scores ranged from 40 -75 with a mean score of 75 out of 100. No one scored 100 on the pre-test. Gaps in knowledge were identified in all 5 disciplines. The greatest knowledge gaps were in respiratory and physical therapy knowledge, both with 62% incorrect answers. Nutrition and mental health had 8% incorrect answers, patient care 13%, general knowledge 20%, and medications 26% incorrect answers to the survey. The questions answered incorrectly most frequently were related to nebulizer cleaning and airway clearance (77% and 69% incorrect answers respectively).Conclusion: This quality improvement project sought to assess inpatient nurse understanding of CF to improve patient experience during hospitalization. The assessment identified areas of knowledge gaps that are being addressed by CF team-based education. Additional interventions include inpatient nurses joining the adult CF team for outpatient clinic visits. The educational program will be reassessed using a post-education assessment to continue to identify areas of improvement. 4 ; Miller, E. 5, 6 ; Sawicki, G.S. 1 1.

Center for Women's Health Research and Innovation, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Background: As health outcomes continue to improve, sexual and reproductive health (SRH) has become an important disease-specific concern for adolescent and young adult (AYA) women with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, SRH is not traditionally addressed in the CF care model. This study aimed to identify the educational needs and preferences of interprofessional CF care team members regarding SRH in AYA women with CF.Methods: Interprofessional CF care team members were recruited to participate in an anonymous online survey via provider-specific listservs and an international conference mobile app. Questions explored provider knowledge and skills in providing general and CF-specific SRH information, factors for optimizing SRH care, and preferred SRH topics and formats for additional training. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics.Results: A total of 523 providers completed the survey. Among participants, 39% were physicians/NPs/PAs, 19% nurses, 20% social workers, and 22% were from other disciplines. Forty-nine percent cared for pediatric patients, 28% for adult patients, and 24% for both. Seventy percent felt comfortable asking family members or partners to leave the room during SRH discussions with AYA women and 66% knew the policies around patient SRH confidentiality. Half (51%) felt they knew how to respond to the SRH concerns of AYA women with CF; however, only 33% reported they knew which questions to ask and 32% felt confident taking a sexual history. Only 29% were comfortable with their current CF-specific SRH knowledge. Regarding CF-specific SRH concerns, 44% were comfortable providing CF pre-pregnancy counseling and 41% providing contraceptive counseling, yet only 19% were comfortable managing urinary incontinence and 11% addressing sexual functioning concerns.Participants identified the following key SRH focus areas for further provider training: pregnancy/parenthood planning, sexual functioning, The University of Mississippi Medical Center provides the only accredited CF center in the state of Mississippi. Therefore patients may drive up to 3 hours to the center. A more convenient way to provide face-to-face education to our patients and families was needed. The goal of this project was to provide education to a larger patient population by increasing attendance at Cystic Fibrosis Patient and Family Education Days.Methods: A spreadsheet was developed including the addresses of the entire pediatric and adult CF population. The areas of highest patient populations in the state were then assessed. These areas were narrowed down to 5 locations to host CF Education Days. The locations were no more than a 1 to 2 hour drive for the target population in the area. Dates were chosen throughout the 2017 calendar year and local restaurants booked to host the events. Patients and parents were called to assess if a dinner during the day or at night would be most convenient for them. Invitations to the Education Days were distributed by mail to each of the patients. Based on family/ patient preferences, 4 events were held at night while 1 was held during the day each during a 2-hour timespan. A meal was served to the attendees. A center update and education regarding improving nutrition in CF patients was presented by the social worker, dietitians, respiratory therapist, nurses and nurse practitioners. Evaluations were collected from the attendees at the end of each program to assess the program and location.Results: In 2015 the University of Mississippi CF center had 7 attendees representing 4 families at Education Day. In 2017, we visited 5 locations around the state and had 40 attendees representing a total of 25 patient families. Some of the comments from the evaluations were as follows:\"Having flexible locations that reaches out all over the state is very helpful!\" \"For a new learner of CF health issues this has been very informative, thank you all for your time!\" \"We really appreciate ya'll coming to us. Thank you!\" \"So glad we were able to attend. By it being close to our hometown we can come every time ya'll have one.\"There was an overwhelming positive response to the 5 locations across the state by all of the attendees. Conclusion: By providing 5 different locations for CF Education Days attendance was increased from 7 attendees in 2015 to 40 attendees in 2017. This method of hosting Education Days has proven successful in providing education to the CF families/patients. For 2018, the CF team is once again traveling across the state to 5 different locations focusing education efforts on pulmonary issues.",

Pulmonary Medicine, UNMH Adult CF Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the CFTR gene. The CF mutation 3849+10kbC>T is rare, often manifesting with more mild disease, often a single organ affected, diagnosed later in life, typically associated with normal/intermediate sweat chloride levels. In the world population the prevalence of CF patients with this mutation is approximately 0.2% (1), in Europe 0.82% (2) and in the United States 1.6% (3). We describe a high prevalence of this mutation within certain patient populations in the CF center at University of New Mexico.Problem: In 2015-2017, 7 adult patients diagnosed with CF at our center were noted to have at least one copy of 3849+10kbC>T mutation. All of these patients self-reported as Native Indian, receiving care at pueblo clinics. With late diagnosis, patients often presented with severe lung disease and little improvement despite initiating aggressive therapies. This late diagnosis is due in part to atypical presentation and if CF is suspected, negative or indeterminate sweat test result in a lack of further work-up.Method: To determine the best methods in educating the outlying providers/population, discussion with pueblo providers and three of the newly diagnosed patients helped direct the methods used. These methods were in the form of PowerPoint presentations to pueblo staff, an educational article directed to the public in a pueblo newsletter (which is also distributed to other pueblos), teleconferences and discussion with a pueblo disability council.",

            "text": "Since the initiation of the educational programs/information there has been one patient diagnosed as a direct result of these educational methods as noted by their primary provider. After educational discussions pueblo providers have identified multiple patients that need further screening. This is an ongoing process as more pueblos request information.Conclusions: Prior to these educational programs, our data supported that patients with this mutation tended to go undiagnosed until later in life. This is due to atypical presentation, negative or indeterminate sweat chloride which often halted any further evaluation for CF. Since initiation of the education one patient has been diagnosed. Positive feedback from all the participating pueblo clinic staff reinforces the indication of previous lack of information about CF in this particular patient population. Our hope is with continued education, open communication with pueblo clinic staff and CF clinic availability other patients will be diagnosed much earlier and initiate earlier interventions.References : Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease with a high treatment burden that impacts all areas of a patient's life. In addition, patients with CF have limited contact with each other due to infection prevention and control guidelines. As a result, patients may feel isolated in caring for their CF. In order to improve education and support for patients, virtual peer support groups were developed and conducted via an online video platform. The goal of the online groups was to educate and empower patients to be active participants in their care while increasing social support through connection with other CF patients.Methods: Cohorts of patients were identified and invited to participate in the groups (group 1-stable patients, group 2-young adult patients who use exercise as ACT, group 3-patients with frequent exacerbations). Each group was to include 10 patients and to run for 6 weekly, standardized sessions. The HIPAA-compliant BlueJeans video conference platform was used and patients had the option to use mobile phones, tablets, or computers to attend the group. Patients received a schedule of the sessions, which were moderated by CF care team members. The telemedicine dept provided support for the program. Session topics included personality styles, co-production, lifestyle change, nutrition, time management, mental health, home IVs, hospitalizations, and CF therapies. The curricula were modified to meet the needs of each group. At the conclusion of the group, patients were surveyed to assess effectiveness of the group and areas for improvement.Results: Group 1 had 10 participants. Post-completion survey indicated 100% of the participants strongly agreed they would recommend the group to others, 100% felt the group met expectations (20% Agree, 80% Strongly Agree), and 100% felt comfortable speaking and sharing during sessions (20% Agree, 80% Strongly Agree). Group 2 did not occur due to lack of interest in the identified cohort. In Group 3, two of 10 confirmed participants participated. They expressed strong satisfaction with the group but acknowledged that increased attendance may have enhanced the experience. The formal post-survey has not yet been distributed, results will be included in the final presentation. Challenges of the virtual groups included patient availability/scheduling, technological difficulties, patient lack of access to technology, and lack of patient attendance despite confirmed interest in the group.Conclusion: An online group can be an effective way to improve education and enhance support for patients with CF while providing a meaningful experience for both patients and care team members. However, there are barriers to implementation, including lack of patient attendance 4 ; Stecenko, A. 4 ; Bellcross, C. 2 ; Wei, J. 5 1.

Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: Adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) often lack the necessary knowledge about CF-specific inheritance and fertility issues to make informed decisions about family planning. There are few evidencebased educational tools for addressing these knowledge gaps. Our aim was to develop an education self-directed module (SDM) on genetics, inheritance, and reproductive issues, and compare knowledge improvement to in-person genetic counseling (GC) on the same topics.Methods: CF patients aged 15-23 years were randomly assigned to complete the SDM or an in-person GC session. Knowledge was measured using a questionnaire several months before and immediately after the intervention. We used paired t-tests to assess improvement in overall score and in each category of the questionnaire (Inheritance, Carriers, and Reproduction). Relative improvements between the GC and SDM groups were compared using independent samples t-tests.Results: A total of 38 participants completed the study, with 19 participants in each intervention group (GC and SDM). From pre-intervention to post-intervention, mean knowledge scores increased from 49% correct to 66% correct (p=.001) in the SDM group and increased from 46% correct to 74% correct (p<.001) in the GC group. The GC group improved significantly in all three questionnaire categories (p\u22640.001), while the SDM group improved significantly only in Inheritance and Reproduction (p\u22640.011). Overall improvement was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.070), though this may reflect a lack of statistical power. The GC group did improve significantly more in the Carriers category than the SDM group (p=0.031).Conclusions: The significant improvement from pre-to post-intervention provides evidence for both genetic counseling (GC) and the self-directed module (SDM) as interventions for targeting the significant knowledge gaps in adolescent CF populations. Our results suggest that the SDM may be less effective in educating patients than a GC session, but a larger study is needed to confirm this. Given that many CF clinics are unable to recruit genetic counselors, the SDM provides a reasonable alternative for the purpose of patient education. London, London, United Kingdom Background: Standardization of the nitrogen multiple breath washout (MBW) test for clinical trials includes the training and qualification of MBW operators. In response to feedback and the changing needs of the CF community, a 2-day instructor-led training session for the Exhalyzer \u00ae D (EcoMedics AG, Duernten, Switzerland) MBW device was condensed to a single day hands-on training with supplemental eLearning modules.",

            "text": "ELearning modules were developed using the Articulate RISE web-based platform. Participants completed a pre-training module prior to the hands-on session. Pre-training topics included physiological principles of MBW, Exhalyzer \u00ae D equipment and a pre-training quiz. After the 1-day hands-on training session, participants completed the posttraining module which consisted of more advanced topics including testing preschool age children and MBW test quality control. Participants were asked to complete a knowledge test and feedback survey at the end of the training.Results: To date, 28 participants from 17 sites have completed the revised MBW training program, of which 61% (17/28) were na\u00efve to MBW testing. Most of the participants indicated that they were confident in conducting a MBW test with an \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" rating on a 5-point Likert scale (26/28; 93%). This compared favorably to feedback from the previous 2-day training program, where the reported confidence in conducting a MBW test was 83% (20/24). Furthermore, all responded that the eLearning resources enhanced the overall learning experience (28/28; 100%). Although some participants reported barriers including initial technical difficulties in accessing the eLearning modules (9/28; 32%), which have since been addressed, there was overwhelmingly positive feedback regarding the design and ease of use of the eLearning modules (28/28; 100%).The average score for the pre-training quiz was 80%, and participants indicated that the pre-training modules prepared them for the hands-on session (26/28; 93%). After completing the post-training module, operators felt confident in recognizing a successful MBW test (23/28; 82%). The post-training knowledge test scores also demonstrated proficiency in understanding of MBW test quality (average score of 82%). To date, 100% of trainees have successfully completed the qualification process for testing children 6 years and older; an improvement from the completion rate observed in the previous 2-day training program (91/102; 89%) (Isaac SM, et al. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2016 ;51(S45): 228).Conclusion: The eLearning MBW training modules are a valuable resource to complement the revised hands-on training as it offers trainees the flexibility and ability to learn at their own pace. Despite the abbreviation of the instructor-led training time, the combined online eLearning and hands-on approach exceeded the prior training qualification success and has the potential to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of the MBW training program. Background: Due to medical advances over the last few decades, most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are living well into their adult years. Many contemplate parenthood, though CF can have significant effects on fertility and health. A large number of patients report never having any consultations about fertility issues with their healthcare providers, despite noting their desire to have these discussions. Previous studies have shown that many individuals with CF have poor understanding of CF inheritance and genetics, though no studies have been conducted exploring this patient population's perceptions about different family building options. In this study, our aim was to assess whether a genetic counseling intervention would be associated with a change in knowledge and/or perceptions about genetics, fertility, assisted reproductive technologies and family building options among adult patients with CF.",

Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA Background: The care for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is complex and often involves multiple chronic medications and long treatment times. It is well-established that a pharmacist is valuable in the ambulatory care setting. Incorporating a CF pharmacist in a multidisciplinary team presents an opportunity to guide prescribers in optimizing a medication regimen and to assist patients in improving their medication knowledge. Pharmacists may be valuable especially in the pediatric setting and have been a part of the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) CF multidisciplinary team since 2013. Children may be at greater risk of medication errors and poor medication adherence due to unique challenges such as off-label use of medications, frequent dose changes, lack of pediatric-friendly formulations, and variable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Therefore, the objective of the study was to evaluate the role of the pediatric pharmacist in the multidisciplinary CF clinic setting.Methods: A retrospective chart review was completed from July 1, 2013 to March 31, 2018. Inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of CF taking one or more medications. A few patients who were not seen by a pharmacist were excluded from the study, and they were also excluded if they had no medications. Each patient's medication regimen was reviewed by the pharmacist to assess the appropriateness of therapy. The interventions made in the clinic were documented and categorized.Results: There were 2,398 total patient encounters for 248 patients during the study period. There was a total of 1,148 pharmacist interventions documented. Pharmacists made an average of 2.6 interventions per clinic day. Of these interventions, 67% were made specifically for patients and/ or caregivers, and 33% were made for the prescribers. The most common categories of interventions included correction of medication dose or frequency (22%), optimization of medication scheduling (16%), correction of inhaled medication administration sequence (8%), and dosage recommendations for the prescribers (8%). Of the total number of interventions, 98% were documented as accepted and appropriate changes were made based on the pharmacist's recommendations. Examples of infrequent but notable interventions included patient referrals to subspecialists for followup, recommendations to order labs for monitoring, and identification of undocumented allergies.Conclusion: We conclude that pharmacists made significant and impactful interventions during the study period. We speculate that the pharmacist plays a valuable role in a multidisciplinary CF clinic setting by optimizing the patient's medication regimen while improving their medication knowledge. Introduction: Food insecurity is a barrier to care that has emerged through interactions between Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation Compass, care centers and CF families. Food quantity and quality are vital for people with CF to manage their disease, making investigating this social determinant of health (SDOH) important. To better understand the scope, barriers, impacts, and interventions related to food insecurity in the CF population, we conducted a needs assessment.",

            "text": "Methods: Between Dec. 2017 and May 2018 Compass conducted a needs assessment to assess food insecurity in CF. This included reviews of published research and reports on SDOH and food insecurity, existing CF-specific literature and research, existing programs and resources, food-related Compass calls, and 3 informal surveys. The first survey (12/2017) collected information via discipline listservs on use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and public housing. The second survey (12/2017) gathered emails from CF social workers to understand food insecurity screening procedures and interventions. The third survey, given at the Nutrition and Social Worker Consortium (4/2018), collected data on the perceived scope of food insecurity in the CF population.Results: The first survey yielded 45 respondents, the second 20, and the third 94. Results from surveys 1 and 2 demonstrate food insecurity is problematic in CF. In the third survey, 54% of respondents indicated 20-39% of their population experience food insecurity while 17% indicated 40-59% of their population are food insecure. In relation to WIC, 37% feel the benefits are sufficient while 12% indicate SNAP benefits are sufficient for people with CF. Clinicians estimated 85% of families are experiencing intermittent or constant food insecurity. One respondent commented, \"families just get used to living without.\" Less than half of CF clinicians (44%) actively screen for food insecurity.Compass has fielded 110 cases related to food insecurity since Feb. 2016. Of these, 67% of callers identified one or more financial needs in addition to food such as housing, transportation, utilities and medical bills. These findings were similar to the third survey results; respondents noted families primarily struggled with transportation, housing and utilities.Respondents from the surveys indicated unique characteristics of food insecurity in the CF population such as the need for increased calories, the cost of medical care which limits resources to purchase food and the cost of high calorie/quality food.Conclusion: Little data and research exist on food insecurity in the CF population; more research is imperative to fully assess the impact on people with CF and families. High medical expenses limit available resources to purchase food needed for the high calorie diets, increasing the likelihood of food insecurity. Clinicians noted federal programs are insufficient to meet the nutritional needs of people with CF; the means to address and intervene are largely dependent upon community resources. Additionally, families prefer not to apply for federal programs due to a perceived stigma. CF clinicians expressed overwhelming interest in this topic to learn more about food insecurity screening and to identify potential interventions.",

Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Scottish Rite, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have increased energy needs due to pancreatic insufficiency (PI), infections, increased work of breathing, and higher baseline metabolic rate. Nutrition supplements are recommended when oral intake is inadequate to meet caloric needs. Furthermore, CF patients have increased needs for fat soluble vitamin supplementation due to malabsorption associated with PI. The out-of-pocket cost for nutrition supplements and vitamins can be burdensome. In 2016, the HealthWell Foundation created a fund aimed at providing financial assistance for patients with CF to help cover the cost of FDA-approved medications, vitamins and nutritional supplements. To qualify for the grant, patients must have health insurance and meet grant income guidelines. In 2016, the combined grant amount for treatments, vitamins and nutrition supplements was $15,000. Currently the grant provides $15,000 for treatments and $2,000 for vitamins and nutrition supplements.Objective: The purpose of this review was to examine nutritional outcomes in CF patients that utilized the HealthWell Foundation grant for nutrition assistance at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Scottish Rite.Methods: Patients approved for the grant between January 2016 and March 2018 who used funds for nutrition assistance were identified through the HealthWell Foundation provider portal. Using linear regression models, associations between dollar amounts paid, grant duration, and change in vitamin D, weight, and BMI percentiles were analyzed. Models were adjusted for baseline (pre-grant) measurements.Results: Over the three years, 26 of 46 (57%) approved patients used the grant for nutrition assistance. The mean duration of grant was 18 months. The mean amounts used for nutrition assistance were $738.21 in 2016, $533.63 in 2017, and $79.50 in 2018. Grants for 2017 and 2018 were still open for use at the time of this review. Grant duration was positively associated with positive weight change (kg) (\u03b2=0.33, SE=0.13, p=0.0206). There were no significant associations between grant amount or grant duration and change in vitamin D levels or BMI percentiles.Discussion: Positive weight trends were noted in patients using the HealthWell Foundation grant. The grant was underutilized with 43% of approved patients not using any funds for nutrition assistance and an average of only 4.9% (2016) of the awarded amount was used for nutrition assistance. As a result of this review, we are revising our EPIC nutrition note to better identify and enroll eligible patients. We are more proactively using the provider portal to track grant use and expiration. This review emphasized that improved education of clinic staff, pharmacies, and CF families is important to ensure this grant is used to its full potential, as it may positively impact nutritional outcomes if the maximum benefit is applied. Background: Folia is a cloud-based platform available on web and mobile devices that enables the capture of home-reported outcomes (HROs) by family caregivers and patients (families). Datapoints collected include symptom presence, severity, characteristics; treatment adherence; biometrics; problematic behavior frequency; and wellness indicators. Folia utilizes multiple-choice questions to simplify data capture. Data are reported to the provider in a PDF document at or before an appointment.",

During appointments, clinicians offered a one-page informational flyer with an invite code for access to Folia. Families were invited to sign up online. In addition to in-clinic enrollment, the Clinic mailed a letter to all families. The Folia team also collaborated with the Southern ME CF Family Advisory Board to hold an in-person event for interested families.To measure the success of initial in-clinic enrollment, we collected a daily count of new Folia users who registered using the invite code. We measured Folia engagement via basic usage statistics, including average number of log-ins per week, ratio of monthly active users vs registered users, and total Folia questions answered. We administered a qualitative survey at 8 weeks. At participant request, we added referral codes for CF caregivers outside of ME.Data: Total clinic population of 80 families; 78 visited clinic. Approximately 45 (58%) received in-clinic information; all received mailing. Registrations: 37 with ME invite code; 44 with referral codes. Engagement: 1.9 log-ins/week/registered-user; 28 active users (35%); 24,560 answers as of May 15, 2018 (877/active-user) . analysis. The types of assistance provided were categorized for reporting purposes.Results: The data indicated that, out of 32 people with CF and their families affected by a disaster, 12 needed assistance accessing or replacing damaged medications and devices, 9 needed help finding a shelter or temporary housing until the storm passed, 3 needed a generator as an alternate/back-up source of electricity, 3 needed help paying for home repairs caused by storm damage, 2 requested guidance on effects of smoke inhalation in people with CF, and 1 family requested tips on disaster and emergency preparedness.Conclusion: Having an emergency preparedness plan during a natural disaster or emergency is important for everyone, but especially critical for people living with a chronic illness. People with CF must have access to medications, treatments, water and shelter, to sustain their daily care. Proactive measures taken by people with CF may help with preparedness and ease some stress and burden so that families can focus on their safety and well-being.",

UCSF Medical Center, San Francisco, CA, USA Background: Quality assurance data collected at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center in 2013 found the top medication issues for patients transitioning out of the hospital include insurance, access, prescription issues, side effects, and directions. CF adults wrestle with issues not only with hospitalization but with new medications, reformulation of existing therapies, changes in insurance plans and alignment of services with specialty pharmacies. To assess how a pharmacy technician (TECH) could service the needs of patients in our Adult CF Program (n=109), we tracked and quantitated the range and extent of a pharmacist's activities delegated to a TECH.Method: Since the addition of a TECH in Dec. 2017, the care team catalogued and tracked pharmacy related activities performed by the TECH. The TECH was tasked with processing high-risk medication prior authorizations (PAs) and treatment authorization requests (TARs). High-risk medications include but are not limited to: inhaled antibiotics, inhaled mucolytics, and CFTR modulator therapy. Other responsibilities include routing high-risk medications to correct specialty pharmacies and facilitating sign up for grants to lower copays. Data are collected on a secured Excel spreadsheet.Results: From Dec. 2016 -Nov. 2017, the pharmacist obtained 87 PA/ TAR approvals and 17 denials. Denials were managed by: letter of appeal (LOA), change to formulary product, discount cash price, or through CF grants/patient assistance programs. Time to resolution of denials ranged 1-104 days. Overall, 106 medication insurance issues were tackled which included: 17 inhaled antibiotics, 13 inhaled dornase alfa, 8 pancreatic enzymes, 3 inhaled hypertonic saline, 10 special CF vitamins, 5 azithromycin, and 50 nonspecialty medications. From Dec. 2017 -Apr. 2018, the TECH managed 50 PA/TAR approvals and 16 denials. Time to resolution of denials ranged 1-180 days. 129 medication insurance issues were resolved: 25 inhaled antibiotics, 24 inhaled dornase alfa, 7 pancreatic enzymes, 3 inhaled hypertonic saline, 10 special CF vitamins, 3 azithromycin, and 57 nonspecialty medications. Additionally, with release of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in Mar. 2018, 61 eligible patients were assessed for therapy. To date, the TECH completed 31 tezacaftor/ivacaftor PAs with 3 denials requiring submission of LOA by the pharmacist. Notably, while the pharmacist encouraged patients to sign up for Healthwell grants, the technician has enrolled 5 patients.Conclusion: Embedding TECHs in the care team supports optimum patient care in managing medication PA/TARs required for patient access to high-risk medications. The TECH is the ideal pharmacy agent to track high-risk medication access and use by managing and updating medication outcomes. Participation in a high functioning care team increased job satisfaction.",

CF Clinic, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada Background: Ivacaftor is one of a group of CFTR modulator medications used to treat cystic fibrosis patients. It was initially approved for patients with at least one copy of the G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. In clinical trials, sweat chloride was used as a surrogate marker to document the effect of ivacaftor on CFTR function. Due to local government funding criteria, our clinic has longitudinally measured sweat chloride in a cohort of pediatric pediatrics treated with ivacaftor. There is little data in the published literature regarding the long-term impact of ivacaftor on sweat chloride measurements, or their variation with time.Objective: The aim of this quality assurance review was to describe the variability in repeated sweat chloride measurements in a pediatric cohort treated with ivacaftor.Methods: Sweat chloride results were reviewed for all patients in our clinic who had received treatment with ivacaftor between 2013 -2018. Descriptive statistics were used to review the variation in measurements for each patient. Given the nature of this work as quality improvement, formal review was waived by the institutional ethics review board.Results: Eight patients were identified who had been treated with ivacaftor. Median age at initiation of treatment with ivacaftor was 6.5 years (range: 3 -14) . Four patients (50%) were male. All patients had one copy of the G551D gene mutation. Median sweat chloride pre-treatment was 109.5 mmol/L (88 -122). Median sweat chloride at the first measurement after initiation of treatment was 47 mmol/L (38 -88).Five patients had repeated annual measurements of sweat chloride after initiation of therapy to ensure ongoing eligibility for government funding. Median number of serial measurements was 5 (4 -8) . (See Table. )Conclusions: Within-patient variability in annual sweat chloride measurements was greater than anticipated in patients being treated long-term with ivacaftor. While adherence to therapy is a primary consideration, we query whether other factors, such as variability in timing of medication administration with respect to sweat chloride measurement, or variation in appropriate fat and enzyme co-administration with the medication, could account for these differences. Based on the findings of this quality assurance review, our team is taking steps to advocate for alteration of the current government funding criteria mandating annual sweat chloride testing, to include other measures of efficacy and adherence. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are often diagnosed by newborn screen shortly after birth. At the first visit at the CF center pancreatic enzymes are commonly prescribed. This can be an overwhelming time for parents with the diagnosis and a new baby. A pharmacist presence in the outpatient CF clinic can have a significant impact on patient care. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of a pharmacist in a CF newborn screen clinic on the length of time from pancreatic enzyme prescribing to patients receiving medication.",

            "text": "Methods: A retrospective study was conducted and included CF patients diagnosed by newborn screen and seen in the CF newborn screen clinic from January 1, 2016 to February 1, 2018. Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed in the hospital and sent home on pancreatic enzymes from the hospital. The patient's medical record was reviewed for date of first visit, date of prescription. Pharmacy records and contact with the pharmacy were used to determine when the patient received the medication and the copay amount if applicable.Results: The study included 15 patients in the no-pharmacist group and 9 patients in the pharmacist group. Sex and age at first visit were similar between the two groups, no-pharmacist group 10 (66.7%) male versus 6 (66.7%) male in the pharmacist group (p=1) and the median (IQR) age at first visit was 15 (12-22) days in the no-pharmacist group and 15 (11. 5-25.5) in the pharmacist group (p=0.9). The median (IQR) number of days from first visit to obtaining pancreatic enzymes in the no-pharmacist group was 3 (1-28) days with a range of 1-125 days. The median (IQR) number of days from first visit to obtaining pancreatic enzymes in the pharmacist group was 1 (0-1) day which was a statistically significant difference from the no-pharmacist group (p=0.003). Patients in the no-pharmacist group had copays range from $0-$106 for the first fill. In the pharmacist group all patients had $0 copay.Conclusions: This is the first study looking at the potential pharmacist impact in a CF newborn screen clinic. The addition of the pharmacist to the CF newborn screen clinic team significantly decreased the time from prescribing to patients obtaining pancreatic enzyme supplementation and reduced patient out of pocket cost. Background: The CF population continues to age, and lengthy hospitalization for IV antibiotics is not feasible for many working adult patients. The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) is a Midwestern academic medical center in Kansas City (KC), KS. The adult CF center at TUKHS cares for more than 230 adults with CF from five area states, with 49% of patients residing outside of the KC greater metro area. Previous quality improvement (QI) work from our center suggests increased residential distance to our center may impact care. Since CF patients are at higher risk for lung function loss during pulmonary exacerbation, we established a post-hospital follow-up clinic for patients discharged home on IV antibiotics, who at time of discharge had not yet recovered their baseline lung function. We aimed to test the feasibility of this clinic with such a large patient catchment area. Here, we report on our experience with a follow-up clinic developed as a QI initiative.",

            "text": "Methods: Patients hospitalized at TUKHS for CF exacerbation who were discharged home on IV antibiotics with an FEV1 that was not yet at baseline (>5% actual FEV1 decline from previous best in prior 6 months) were offered a follow-up clinic appointment. The appointment was scheduled at day 14 of IV antibiotic treatment to assess clinical response. If FEV1 was not yet at baseline, IV antibiotic extension for at least 1 week was recommended. Central lines were removed in the follow-up clinic if antibiotic course was complete. Distance traveled, mean antibiotic duration, attendance in clinic, and patient satisfaction were assessed.Results: Forty-four patients between Aug. 2017 and April 2018 qualified for outpatient IV antibiotic follow-up. Three patients (7%) met criteria but were not offered a follow-up appointment and were excluded from analysis. Twenty-eight patients (64%) maintained their follow-up appointment and traveled an average round trip distance of 117.4 miles (range 1-774 miles). Ten patients (23%) with average distance to travel of 150.9 miles declined the follow-up appointment. Three patients (7%) with average distance to travel of 125.7 miles did not show or canceled their appointment. Mean antibiotic duration of those who attended the follow-up clinic was longer than those who did not attend clinic at 17.1 vs. 16.4 days, respectively. Patients who declined or did not show for follow-up appointment had lower FEV1 than patients that maintained the appointment at 47% vs 55.6%, respectively (p=0.3). Of patients who completed the survey, when asked if the follow-up clinic was beneficial, the average score was a 4.5 on a Likert scale, with 4.0 being \"agree\" and 5.0 being \"strongly agree.\"Conclusion: Many adult patients prefer to complete antibiotics at home instead of the hospital. The distance to CF center may impact patient care and follow-up in these patients. Despite a large catchment area, our results suggest pulmonary exacerbation follow-up clinic was valued by patients and has a positive effect on post-hospital outcomes. Future work will include evaluation of the impact post-hospital follow-up clinic has on probability of recovery to baseline FEV1 in a larger sample size.",
