While not properly geared to allow serious predictions of future values of the epidemic, they are nevertheless able to display the past and present history with amazing clarity. However, as their calculation depends on the values of various mathematical parameters (like the length of transmission and incubation periods), this ability may be impaired by inaccuracies in their estimation. This is particularly true for the widely used basic reproduction number, which measures the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual in a full susceptible population ( Figure 1 ). On the other hand, once some mathematical model has been chosen to simulate the disease dynamics and its parameters determined, several alternative reproductive numbers become automatically available at no additional computational cost, many showing very little dependence on key parameters like transmission or incubation times. We will illustrate this fact in the context of deterministic SEIR models, but our approach can be adapted to other mathematical models (deterministic or stochastic) as well.",

To well define the model (1.1), besides informing the functions \u03b2(t) and r(t) we need to provide the initial values S(t 0 ), E(t 0 ), I(t 0 ), R(t 0 ), D(t 0 ), which is not a trivial task, since not all of these variables are reported, and those reported may be in error -which may well be large in case of significant underreporting. It thus seems clear that predicting reasonably right values for the variables S(t), E(t), I(t), R(t) and D(t) at future times is not a simple problem, especially in the long time range. The situation becomes even more complicated for more complex (i.e., stratified) models, which add other variables and parameters to be determined. Calibrating many parameters can quickly become a nightmare. For all its simplicity, models with few variables and parameters like (1.1) can yield surprisingly good results and thus should not be overlooked, as will be seen in the sequel.",

This is highly debatable, since this parameter refers to that particular fraction of the susceptible population that is effectively subject to infection. For deterministic models, this introduces the possibility that an outbreak might not happen after the introduction or reintroduction of a few infected individuals, as it has been long recognized in the stochastic literature [1, 9] . In any case, it turns out that N is not so much important for the short range dynamics as it proves to be in the long run (see Figures 2a and 2b) , so that for our present purposes this is not a serious issue. We have therefore taken for N the full population of the region under consideration. ",
