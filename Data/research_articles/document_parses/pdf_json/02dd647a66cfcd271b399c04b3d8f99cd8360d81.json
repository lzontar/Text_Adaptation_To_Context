Non-factoid questions are defined as open-ended questions that require complex answers, like descriptions, opinions, or explanations, which are mostly passage-level texts. Questions like \"How to cook burgers?\" are non-factoid.

There have been efforts for developing non-factoid question answering datasets [7, 8, 16] . Keikha et al. [8] introduced the WebAP dataset, which is a non-factoid QA dataset with 82 queries. The questions and answers in WebAP were not generated by real users. There exist a number of datasets that partially contain non-factoid questions and were collected from CQA websites, such as Yahoo! Webscope L6, Qatar Living [9] , and StackExchange. These datasets are often restricted to a specific domain, suffer from incomplete judgments, and/or do not contain sufficient non-factoid questions for training sophisticated machine learning models. The nfL6 dataset [1] is a collection of non-factoid questions extracted from the Yahoo! Webscope L6. Its main drawback is the absence of complete relevance annotation. Previous work assumes that the only answer that the question writer has marked as correct is relevant, which is far from being realistic. That is why we aim to collect a complete set of relevance annotations. WikiPassageQA is another non-factoid QA dataset that has been recently created by Cohen et al. [3] . As mentioned in Sect. 1, despite its great potentials, it has a number of limitations. ANTIQUE addresses these limitations to provide a complementary benchmark for nonfactoid question answering (see Sect. 1). More recently, Microsoft has released the MS MARCO V2.1 passage re-ranking dataset [10] , containing a large number of queries sampled from the Bing search engine.

Since workers needed background knowledge for answering the majority of the questions, we also included\u00e2 in the instructions and called it a \"possibly correct answer.\" In some cases, the question is very subjective and could have multiple correct answers. This is why it is called \"possibly correct answer\" to make it clear in the instructions that other answers could potentially be different from the provided answer, but still be correct. Label Definitions. To facilitate the labeling procedure, we described labels in the form of a flowchart to users. Our aim was to preserve the notion of relevance in QA systems as we discriminate it with the typical topical relevance definition in ad-hoc retrieval tasks. The definition of each label is as follows: Label 4: It looks reasonable and convincing. Its quality is on par with or better than the \"Possibly Correct Answer\". Note that it does not have to provide the same answer as the \"Possibly Correct Answer\". Label 3: It can be an answer to the question, however, it is not sufficiently convincing. There should be an answer with much better quality for the question. Label 2: It does not answer the question or if it does, it provides an unreasonable answer, however, it is not out of context.

It is interesting to note that the ratio of pairs with no agreement was nearly the same among the 7 batches (\u223c13%). In the very rare cases of no agreement after two rounds of annotation (776 pairs), an expert annotator decided on the final label.
