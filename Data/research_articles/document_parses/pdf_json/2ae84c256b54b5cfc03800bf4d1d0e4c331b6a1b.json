This does not apply with ancilla and borrow closure. In this section we collect some results about maximal ancilla and borrow closed RTAs. The following result reflects the first part of Theorem 4. We will call k the index of the maximal ancilla closed or borrow closed RTA. From Theorem 2 we then note the following. In this case, we can say a bit more for index 2. If A is of order 3, then by the argument in Theorem 4 above, we find that M = Aff(A), the affine maps over a field of order 3. Otherwise A is at least 5 and B 1 (A) is no longer affine.

            "text": "The results for borrow and ancilla closed RTAs are not as comprehensive. We hope to determine these in the foreseeable future. We note interestingly that for a state set of order 5 or more, Lemma 11 indicates that if we can implement all permutations of the state set, we need only have one non-degenerate gate in order to implement all gates under borrow or ancilla closure. Similarly we see that once we can implement all affine maps on a state set of prime power order, then only one nonaffine gate is needed to implement all gates. For the ancilla case, many of the techniques of [1] will prove useful. In the ancilla case, we know all maximal RTA with index 2 except for A of order 4.",
