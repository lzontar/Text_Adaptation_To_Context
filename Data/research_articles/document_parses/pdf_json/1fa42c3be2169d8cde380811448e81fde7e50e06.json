Specifically, the proportion of African Americans residing in a given southern state and the proportion of COVID-19 related mortality that are comprised of African Americans in that state are as follows: AL -26.6% and `50%, GA -31.5% and ~50%, LA -32.2% and 59%, and MS -37.7% and 57%.

            "text": "There are likely to be several reasons for the disproportionate causes of mortality amongst African Americans in the four southern states we have interrogated here. First, emerging clinical series on COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise 4, 5 . Indeed, in three of the states (AL, LA and MS) where such data is publicly cataloged, many of the patients dying from causes related to confirmed COVID-19 had an underlying chronic health condition (Table 1) . Secondly, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The unacast COVID-19 toolkit (https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) can be used to derive a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three different metrics: (i) percent change in average distance traveled (ii) percent change in non-essential visits and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national baseline), each of is an average to create the overall grade for that state. Based on these parameters, all four states received a SD grade of F. Unfortunately, the suboptimal SD measures adopted statewide is even more likely to impact individuals living in crowded urban localities, those relying on public transport, or families where one or more members have been deemed as \"essential\" at-work personnel. According to PovertyUSA (www.povertyUSA.org), the poverty rates in the four states stands at 18.4% on average, which is greater than the national rate of 14.1%; in addition, of the reported overall numbers, the average poverty rate amongst the African American community (29.1%) is approximately 2.3 times higher compared to Caucasians (12.6%). The median household income reported by US Census Bureau for AL, GA, LA and MS were $49,861, $58,756, $47,905, and $44,717, respectively, which is, on average, more than $11,600 less than the national median household income ($61,937).",
