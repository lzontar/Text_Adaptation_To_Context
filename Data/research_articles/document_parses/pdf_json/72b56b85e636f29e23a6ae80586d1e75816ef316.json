Disasters are the aftermath of hazards caused by natural phenomena, set off by shifts in tectonic plates or atmospheric interactions in populated areas. The extant literature offers a variety of ways to classify natural hazards. For example, they can be categorized by their origingeological, hydrometeorological or biophysical; by their nature and speedpermanent, ephemeral or episodic; or on the basis of their size or scalelarge, medium or small. Adopting the last of the three classification schemes, this chapter presents large scale hazards, which are more likely to occur on the North American continent, in alphabetical order.

Unlike hurricanes that have a definite beginning and end and can easily be seen as they develop and move, drought can develop slowly over time and impact many sectors of the economy in a systematic manner, thereby influencing many different space and time scales. However, drought can be viewed with respect to two general time periods. There can be acute and chronic drought events. An acute (or shortterm) drought example can be seen through the Canadian prairie drought where the system is able to rebound when weather patterns return moisture. In terms of chronic (or long-term) drought, a dramatic example is the drying of the Aral Sea. In this case, drought has essentially caused a large water body to vanish, going extinct.

Hydrological drought is observed when restricted water supply becomes evident, especially in streams, reservoirs, and groundwater levels. This type of drought usually happens after many months of meteorological drought. The result of this type of drought has immediate impact to local hydrology of impacted areas that are reflected in biological activity and in some cases the economy and society. Agricultural drought happens when crops become affected and cannot support normal biological growth (function). This type of drought is by nature connected to both meteorological and hydrological drought controls.

The location below the earth's surface where the earthquake starts is known as the hypocenter, whereas the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is termed the epicenter. Thus, the distinction between the hypocenter and the epicenter is their closeness to the earth's surface. In 1.4 Earthquake some cases, an earthquake may have foreshocks. Foreshocks are smaller earthquakes that happen at the same location as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists are unable to determine that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens, and need to wait in anticipation before sending formal reports on seismic activity. The mainshock is the largest, main earthquake of large tectonic plate slip. Mainshocks are always followed by aftershocks due to surficial geologic structure finding stability after the initial event. Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that occur in the same place as the mainshock but only afterwards. It is not well understood but aftershocks can happen continuously for weeks to years after the mainshock, as dependent on the size of the mainshock. Earthquake hazards include any physical phenomenon associated with an earthquake that may produce adverse effects on human activities and livelihoods. While they are often used as synonyms, it is useful to distinguish between \"hazards\" and \"risk\". Hazards are the natural phenomena that might impact a region, regardless of whether there is anyone around to experience them or not. Risk refers to what we stand to lose when the hazard occurs; it is what we have built that's threatened. Risk can usually be measured in dollars or fatalities. Hazard is generally measured in more physical units: energy, shaking strength, depth of water inundation, etc. (PNSN 2015).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Earthquake"}, {"text": "A number of scales are used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes.

It does not have a mathematical basis thus being based on subjective and qualitative assessment. It is instead an arbitrary ranking based on observed effects. The lower numbers of the intensity scale generally deal with the manner in which the earthquake is felt by people. The higher numbers of the scale are based on observed structural damage.

Several scientific studies, such as Ploeger et al. (2008) , have noted that intraplate earthquakes are felt over a larger area than plate boundary earthquakes of the same magnitude. This is likely due to the relatively stable and un-fractured crust in the continental interior and the presence of soft and deep sediments in some areas.

The susceptibility of people being killed or injured by falling debris such as glass, chimneys, book cases, and roof tiles is of concern during earthquakes as their risk is higher.

Buildings on a thick layer of loose sand, silty clays; soft and saturated granular soils; sand and gravel may experience more damage than a building built on deep, unbroken bedrock and stiff soils (Natural Resources Canada 2009).

Therefore, the outcome of a large earthquake in Ontario is not likely to be comparable in destruction as the outcome of the 2010 Haitian earthquake.

The index is based on a calculation of heat and humidity by using current air temperature and the dew point (the temperature and barometric pressure at which water vapour condenses into liquid).

When ice accumulation is more than 6 mm, it is characterized as an ice storm. An ice storm is a type of winter storm that is defined by freezing rain that falls when ground temperatures are below zero because supercooled water droplets come in contact with the cold surface on the ground and freeze quickly on impact. Typically, freezing rain develops when a moist warm front moves on the top of a cold air mass. Rain falling from the warmer layer becomes supercooled (droplets do not freeze) going through the cold layer without freezing, but freezes as soon as it touches the surface on the ground (Fig. 1.16 ).

In 1936, in Canada, 500 people died in the only severe heat wave recorded in the past 115 years of the international disaster database (EMDAT 2015a). Table 1.3 shows historical cold wave events occurred in Canada since 1900. A heat wave is usually defined as a period of 3 or more consecutive days with temperatures of 30 C or higher in North America. High humidity is not a requisite, yet most, but not the worst, heat waves are oppressively humid (Environment Canada 2015). The summer of 2012 was the year of the big heat -16th warm year in a row. In the last ten years there have only been 4 out of 40 seasons that were colder than normal. In 2012 alone, winter, spring and summer were among the top 10 hottest for their respective seasons. Each of July, August and September tied or exceeded any previous year for the warmest on record. It follows that July through September was the warmest of any three-month period in Canada in 65 years. From January to November inclusive, 2012 was the fourth warmest since 1948 when record-keeping began on a nationwide basis. Every region felt the warmth, especially the millions of Canadians living in the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Lowlands who experienced the warmest such period on record (Environment Canada). Figure 1.5 shows temperature anomalies for the 2012 Big Heat event (Canadian Environmental Health Atlas 2016). The Government of Canada (GoC 2015) provides calculation of climatic normal for Canada on a 30 year period basis.
