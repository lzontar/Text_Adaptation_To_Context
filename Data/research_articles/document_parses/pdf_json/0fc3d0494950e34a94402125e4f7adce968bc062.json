Our study describes the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HMPV present in patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Guangzhou, Southern China. study design A cross-sectional study. setting Two tertiary hospitals in Guangzhou. Participants and methods Throat swabs were collected over a 3-year period from 5133 paediatric patients (\u226414 years) hospitalised with ARI. Patients who are HMPV positive with clinical presentations (101/103) were recorded for further analysis. results Of the 5133 patients included in the study, 103 (2.0%) were positive for HMPV. HMPV was more prevalent in children \u22645 years (2.2%, 98/4399) compared with older children (>5-14 years) (0.7%, 5/734) (P=0.004). Two seasonal HMPV peaks were observed each year and mainly occurred in spring and early summer. Overall, 18 .4% (19/103) of patients who are HMPV positive were codetected with other pathogens, most frequently respiratory syncytial virus (36.8%, 7/19) . Patients who are HMPV positive presented with a wide spectrum of clinical features, including cough (100.0%, 101/101), abnormal pulmonary breath sound (91.1%, 92/101), fever (88.1%, 89/101), expectoration (77.2%, 78/101), coryza (50.5%, 51/101) and wheezing (46.5%, 47/101). The main diagnosis of patients who are HMPV positive was bronchopneumonia (66.7%, 56/84). Fever (\u226538\u02daC) (91.6%, 76/83) was detected more often in patients with only HMPV detected than in patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected (72.2%, 13/18) (P=0.037), whereas diarrhoea was more common in patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected (22.2%, 4/18) , compared with patients with HMPV only (3.6%, 3/83) (P=0.018).

Throat swab samples (n=5133), from paediatric patients (\u226414 years) hospitalised with ARI, were collected at two hospitals between July 2013 and June 2016. ARI was defined as an illness that presented with at least two of the following clinical presentations: cough, nasal obstruction, coryza, sneeze and dyspnoea during the previous week. Patients, who were diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography during the previous week, were also included in the study, even if they did not show the clinical features described above. Some patients, who had been cured and discharged some time ago and readmitted because of new episodes of ARI, if met the recruitment criteria, were included in the study as new cases, otherwise excluded. Chest radiography was performed based on the clinical situation of the patients. The samples were collected according to established clinical protocols. 17 The samples were refrigerated at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C in viral transport medium, transported on ice to the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and analysed immediately or stored at \u221280\u00b0C before analysis as previously described. 18 The patients' clinical presentations or diagnoses were recorded from patients' medical records by attending physicians, using designed presentation cards and were categorised retrospectively into the following four groups: URTI, LRTI, systemic influenza-like symptoms and gastrointestinal illness. Patients with nasal obstruction, coryza, sneezing, coughing, expectoration or hoarseness were categorised as having URTI. Patients with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, increased lung markings, dyspnoea or an abnormal pulmonary breath sound were categorised as having LRTI. Patients with a high fever (\u226538\u00b0C), chills or debilitation were categorised as having systemic influenza-like symptoms. Patients with vomiting, poor appetite or diarrhoea were categorised as having gastrointestinal illness. Some patients were assigned to several clinical presentation groups. Patients with incomplete clinical data were excluded from this analysis. Increased lung markings, bronchopneumonia, pneumonia and bronchiolitis were diagnosed by chest radiography. Abnormal pulmonary breath sounds included phlegmatic, wheezy, bubbling and moist rales.

This may be explained by the immunity against HMPV, which is passed down from mother to child, gradually subsiding over time. Moreover, children were more contact with outside world as they grew older. Therefore, children of this age need more attention to prevent HMPV infection. Moreover, our findings suggested no difference in risk between sex, there was no significant difference in the HMPV prevalence between male and female patients (P=0.771), which is consistent with previous studies. 35 36 HMPV has a typical seasonal distribution. HMPV activity is largely affected by different local climate factors.

Of all the clinical features recorded, cough (100.0%, 101/101), abnormal pulmonary breath sound (91.1%, 92/101), fever (88.1%, 89/101), expectoration (77.2%, 78/101), coryza (50.5%, 51/101) and wheezing (46.5%, 47/101) occurred frequently in patients who are HMPV positive, similar to those reported previously. 16 29 52 55 Most of the patients who are HMPV positive had a fever (88.1%, 89/101); it appeared more frequently in patients with only HMPV detected than in the patients with HMPV plus other pathogen(s) detected (P=0.037).
