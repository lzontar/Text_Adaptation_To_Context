Influenza viruses A and B cause seasonal outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality. The first influenza A (swine flu) virus of the H1N1 subtype was isolated from in humans in 1974 [1] . In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a swine-oriented influenza virus pandemic, H1N1 2009 pandemic [2] . During this outbreak in 2009/ 2010, around 18,500 deaths were reported associated with confirmed H1N1 influenza virus with a mortality rate of 0.12 deaths per 100,000 populations [3] . According to United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 12,470 fatal cases based on data using mathematical models [4] . A majority of patients with Influenza A H1N1 subtype usually present with symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections such as, sudden onset of fever, cough, sore throat, headache, myalgia, and generalized weakness. The symptoms may be self-limiting in most but it can progress to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality [5, 6] . Studies have shown that up to 66% hospitalized patients had chest radiographic abnormalities compatible with pneumonia [3] . There are no unique clinical features that distinguish Influenza A subtype H1N1 infection from other forms of viral respiratory infections. Although a number of patients had predisposing immune-compromising conditions, healthy persons are also at risk for illness and death from H1N1 Influenza pneumonia [2] . In a study from Turkey; 30.6% patients presented with interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph and 36% with consolidation [7] . Studies have shown increased severity of disease in pregnant women, transplant recipients and patients with malignancies [8, 9] .
