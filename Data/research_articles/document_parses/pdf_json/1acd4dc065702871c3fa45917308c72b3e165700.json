No other medical specialty provides such training. As of January 2020, there are 73 accredited preventive medicine residency programs in the U.S. and approximately 6,431 board-certified preventive medicine physicians currently in the U.S. 18 It is important to draw a distinction between the medical specialty of preventive medicine and preventive medicine services such as immunizations, breast cancer screening, and blood pressure testing. While the two overlap in that preventive medicine physicians can provide preventive medical services, they are not the same. While any clinician may provide or recommend preventive medical services, the specialty of preventive medicine is unique in combining both direct patient care clinical skills and public health expertise.",

Tribal health delivery is a multifaceted, complex undertaking, of which rurality is merely one aspect. In Alaska, population density is as low as 1.1 people per square mile, with some villages only accessible by boat or airplane. 20 There are 573 federally recognized Tribes in 37 states, served by 116 federal IHS facilities and 498 Tribal facilities, 41 Urban Indian Organizations, 21 and 11 Indian Health Boards. 22 Given this wide array of health systems, there should be ample opportunity for preventive medicine physicians to engage in rural and Tribal health activities.",

This evident lack of publications describing the rural or Tribal practice patterns of preventive medicine physicians precludes the opportunity to identify the number of preventive medicine physicians who practice with rural or Tribal populations. Unfortunately, there is no reason to believe that preventive medicine physicians currently practice with rural or Tribal populations at higher rates than other clinicians. As an aside, one difficulty in assessing the effect of preventive medicine physicians may be that, unlike direct-patient care providers, a preventive medicine physician's practice location may not necessarily rule out rural or Tribal practice (e.g., a health department located within a city, but focused on large rural geographic areas surrounding the metropolitan area), so a descriptive measure of the population being addressed is likely a better gauge of rural or Tribal practice than the physical location of the preventive medicine physician's activity.

If public health and population health are the mechanism by which rural and Tribal health are to be addressed, as the authors believe it should be, preventive medicine physicians should have a role in these efforts.

            "text": "likely to serve Tribal populations. This propensity should also apply to the specialty of preventive medicine. But again, there is unfortunately no reason to believe that the 0.3 percent of U.S. physicians who identify as AI/AN26 have chosen preventive medicine as a specialty in greater numbers than any other medical specialty.Given the unknown, likely paucity, of preventive medicine physicians working in rural and Tribal communities, opportunities should be taken to increase the number of such practitioners. Of course, one way to increase the number of preventive medicine physicians with rural and AI/AN backgrounds is to recruit them into medical school and into the specialty of preventive medicine. In addition, since preventive medicine residencies are unique in that their final year of training is spent in practicum rotations, residency programs can be encouraged to develop rotations addressing health issues in rural and Tribal populations. Ideally, these rotations would also take place in rural and Tribal communities for an immersive experience.27 With their long-standing connection to the US Public Health Service, Tribal health programs and IHS facilities would make excellent opportunities for preventive medicine practicum rotations given an appropriate educational experience focused on population health. Other placements can include rotations at medical organizations providing direct patient care services in rural areas, public health organizations addressing population health issues, or even state or federal offices of rural health. Of course, low numbers of preventive medicine physicians in rural and Tribal areas poses difficulties in having adequate faculty or preceptors for rotations. However, not all Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f rotations must be led by a board-certified preventive medicine specialist, and a good educational experience isn't necessarily dependent on this factor. Preventive medicine residency programs could also provide concerted focus on rural and Tribal health in their residency curricula to produce specialists geared towards entering such practice. The clinical portion of preventive medicine residencies could provide opportunities for immersion in rural and Tribal clinical work. The academic segment of their residency training can also focus on rural and Tribal health issues. Medical schools and/or schools of public health with academic partnerships to facilities in rural areas could easily provide the expertise and infrastructure for such programs. The authors are not proposing a required pivot toward rural and Tribal health for all preventive medicine training. Rather, whereas others have advocated for \"focused\" preventive medicine residencies, 28 the authors simply suggest opening currently underutilized practice avenues where the specialty can be successfully applied, namely in rural and Tribal areas. Furthermore, preventive medicine residency programs could be specifically created for an explicit focus on rural and Tribal population health. Some primary care residency programs have been created specifically for the purpose of training their graduates for rural practice; there is no reason why preventive medicine residencies could not do the same. If mission statements are a yardstick, currently, of the 73 accredited preventive J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f medicine residency programs, only 2 mention -underserved\u2016 in their online mission statements, 29,30 only one mentions -Tribal,\u2016 31 and none specifically mention -rural.\u2016",
