COVID 19 is a pneumonia-like disease caused by a novel coronavirus that emerged in the Province of Wuhan in China in November 2019. Worldwide, confirmed cases of the disease had reached 9,289,255 as of June 25, 2020, while in the Western Pacific Region, the confirmed cases climbed to 206,948. Moreover, at this time there were 478,160 confirmed deaths and confirmed cases had been reported in more than 200 countries. The USA, Brazil, Russia, and India remained the countries with highest numbers of confirmed cases, accounting for 49% of all confirmed cases globally (WHO, 2020) . Of the confirmed cases worldwide, 6%, or 90,000, were in healthcare workers. In the Philippines, since January 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has climbed to 31,826, with 22,197 active cases and 1,186 confirmed fatalities. The country's health agency identified 2,736 healthcare workers who contracted the disease, of whom 1,006 were nurses (Department of Health, 2020) .",

Higher anxiety levels were also associated with impairment in some bodily functions, negative coping mechanisms (such as increased intake of alcohol or drugs), stress and depression and increased suicidal ideation (Lee et al., 2020) .

Using a cut-off score of \u2265 9.0 on the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, 37.8% of the respondents were identified to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Due to the apparent lack of studies using similar tools in which nurses were the participants, comparison with highly similar studies was not possible. However, the proportion of participants in this study who experienced dysfunctional levels of COVID-19 anxiety was lower than in the general population (54.8%; Lee et al., 2020) . This may be due to the fact that nurses have wider knowledge of the nature of COVID-19, its transmission and symptoms and measures to prevent the disease than the general population, which could contribute to the lower anxiety levels. Since nurses are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients and in the delivery of healthcare services, it is essential to implement measures to reduce anxiety levels among nurses, as dysfunctional anxiety levels have been identified as a strong precursors of psychological distress, depression and other psychological disorders (Teles, Barbosa, & Vargas, 2014; Mo et al., 2020) .",

In addition, this study confirms earlier studies in which many nurses reported not being sufficiently prepared to handle patients affected by infectious disease (e.g. Ebola, H1N1; MnMullan et al., 2016; Bugade et al., 2018) or respond to emergency and disaster situations (Labrague et al., 2018b; Labrague et al., 2016; Tzeng et al., 2016) . The results of this study highlight the need for nurses to be fully equipped with the required competencies to better handle and manage patients affected by disease outbreaks and in emergency situations.

These symptoms can range from relatively nonthreatening to much more harmful manifestations (McGrandles & Duffy, 2012) . In this study, among the different symptoms of coronavirus anxiety, 'tonic mobility' and 'sleep disturbance' were reported to be the most pronounced symptoms. This result is similar to those of a study involving the general population in Poland in which both items obtained the highest means (Skalski et al., 2020) , while in a study by Shelvin et al. The most important findings of this study were the significant direct effects of personal resilience, social support and organisational support on COVID-19 anxiety levels in nurses above and beyond the influence of nurse characteristics. To author's knowledge, this study is the first to confirm such relationships; thus, the study contributes knowledge to the nursing literature on this important topic. First, the reduced COVID-19 anxiety levels in nurses who had higher scores on the resilience scale demonstrate the protective role of personal resilience, which enables an individual to positively adapt in stressful and anxiety-provoking situations and bounce back successfully despite adverse circumstances (Foster et al., 2019) .

This result is in line with previous studies linking higher resilience in nurses to reduced burnout, compassion fatigue, anxiety, depression and psychological distress (Mealer et al., 2017; Cooper et al., 2020) . Higher resilience was also associated with enhanced outcomes in an individual, such as increased psychological health and mental well-being (Foster et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2017) . In a literature review by De Brier et al. (2020) , maximising resilience in HCWs during the COVID-19 crisis was seen as vital to assist them in safeguarding their mental and psychological health and wellbeing. This pattern of influence was similar to that of findings in a general population, in which personal resiliency and social support contributed significantly to reducing the severity of anxiety associated with the novel coronavirus (Skalski et al., 2020) .",

In a study involving doctors and nurses, higher scores on the social support scale were negatively associated with anxiety, depression and sleep disorders, suggesting that psychological symptoms of healthcare staff could be eased by enhancing social support during the COVID-19 pandemic (Zou et al., 2020) .

This result was expected, as adequate organisational support, or the degree to which the organisation recognises the employees and values their well-being, has been associated with increased nurse job performance and commitment, which are vital when dealing with a disease outbreak (Shiao et al., 2007; Jung et al., 2020) . Further, when nurses' perceived greater support from the organisation, they were more motivated, highly satisfied and experienced less stress when carrying out their duties (Higazee et al., 2016; Labrague et al., 2019c) . This result suggests that during disease outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when stress and anxiety is high, providing adequate organisational support (e.g. structural support, efficient communication, provision of a safe work environment, relevant trainings related to COVID-19, monitoring of HCWs' health and wellbeing) are vital to assist nurses facing the different challenges brought about by the coronavirus crisis.",
