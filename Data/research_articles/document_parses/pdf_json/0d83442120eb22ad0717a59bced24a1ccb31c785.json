            "text": "COVID-19 is a new disease which is caused by coronavirus. The viral particles can easily reach the pulmonary terminal structure, such as the alveolar wall and the interlobular septum, which causes an early alveolar exudation, and a lymphocytic infiltration in the pulmonary interstitium. The most common clinical manifestations are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, nausea, headache and hemoptysis (1) . A non-determined percentage RT-PCR positive patients will remain asymptomatic through follow-up. In some severe cases, the disease causes breathing difficulties leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS especially in persons with co-morbidities. On a chest CT, the most common findings include ground glass opacities which may have superimposed interlobular septal thickening or intralobular lines (so-called crazy paving pattern).They are preferentially located in the posterior lower lobe and in the subpleural regions (1) . As the disease progresses, these lesions may become more confluent with associated consolidation. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy have been rarely described. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is an uncommon presentation of COVID-19. SPM is define as by the presence of air in the mediastinum without evident causes -traumatic, iatrogenic, hollow organ perforation, surgery, gas producing infections -. The condition is often seen in young male patient with a mean age of 20 years (2) . The most common clinical symptom is chest pain. Others symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, dysphagia may be included in the clinical spectrum. The pathophysiology underlying spontaneous pneumomediastinum is the presence of a pressure gradient between the alveoli and the lung interstitium resulting in alveolar rupture as describe by Macklin (3) . The air is accumulated in the interstitium then circulates through the venous sheaths to the mediastinum. There is two mechanisms that create this pressure gradient: increase of intra-alveolar pressure or decrease pressure in peri-alveolar interstitial space. The first mechanism is seen in intentional Valsalva maneuver or similar condition that are describe as precipitating factors (2) . Conditions that provoke Valsava maneuver are: coughing, sneezing, defecation, giving birth, nausea and vomiting (4). The second mechanism occurs during extreme respiratory effort, marijuana smoking, diabetic ketosis, rapid reduction in atmospheric pressure (5).",

Therefore, the damage of alveolar membrane in coronavirus infections can be one of the mechanism leading to alveolar rupture thus the occurrence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Consequently, spontaneous pneumomediastinum is more likely to occur when there are extensive pulmonary lesions on CTexpression of the severity of alveolar damage-. At our knowledge, two cases of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients have been reported. The first case was a 35 year old male who presented on day 11 of admission exertional angina with cardiac palpitations and respiratory wheezing. His chest CT revealed parenchymal abnormalities compatible with the evolution of the COVID-19 pneumonia but also a pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. The evolution was marked by the resolution of the pneumomediastinum by day 25, along with improvement of the symptoms and parenchymal lesions on CT (13) . The second patient is a 62 male with history of chronic bronchitis. The pneumomediastinum was observed 10 days after admission, on the chest CT performed following worsening of symptoms. The authors linked the pneumomediastinum to the use of high flow oxygen mask in the management of the breathing difficulties due to the severity of the COVID -19 infection (14) .",

Our patient has no precipitating or predisposing factors of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and presented no symptoms. Additionally, there was not extensive parenchymal lesion on her CT. She totally recovered and had no complication during her follow-up. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is mostly benign, self-limiting disease. The treatment approach is based on rest, oxygen therapy and analgesia (4). A predisposing or precipitating factor should be managed. The association of pneumomediastum with COVID-19 does not imply a specific treatment, but should be fear as a potential aggravating factor specifically in case of extensive pulmonary lesions.",
