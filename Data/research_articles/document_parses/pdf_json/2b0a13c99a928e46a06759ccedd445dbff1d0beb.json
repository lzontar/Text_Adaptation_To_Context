Considering the current dynamic situation and the ongoing spread of COVID-19 virus, it is important to provide physicians with information about COVID-19 risk management in non-healthcare settings, which are less familiar with this type of situation. Physicians and other HCWs are generally used to following instructions about containment of infection, while other workers are less accustomed to this.

Symptoms are generally similar to flu (fever, dry cough, headache, sore throat and runny nose), but ~25% of patients require intensive care and 10% require mechanical ventilation [5, 6] . The case-fatality rate is variable and depends on several factors (age, co-morbidity, etc.), but is ~2%. Although several modes of transmission have been identified, the virus is transmitted primarily through large respiratory droplets from close contacts [6, 7] . Data on the survival time of the virus in the environment are still poorly understood, but it seems that the SARS-CoV-2 is able to survive for several days [8] . The incubation period varies from 1 to 14 days, with a median of 5-6 days. Therefore, the quarantine period should be around 2 weeks after a close contact with a person with symptoms. The expected number of secondary cases caused by a single person with COVID-19 in a susceptible population (R 0 ) is 2\u00b72, somewhat higher than seasonal flu (1\u00b70-2\u00b70), but lower than measles (12-18) [4] .
