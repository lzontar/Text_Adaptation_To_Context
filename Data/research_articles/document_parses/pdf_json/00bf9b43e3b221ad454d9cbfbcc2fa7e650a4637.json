The Chinese government limited the migration of people almost from all walks of life. Medical workers have rushed into Hubei province to fight against the epidemic. Any activity that can increase infection is prohibited. The aim of this study was to confirm that timely lockdown, largescale case-screening and other control measures proposed by the Chinese government were effective to contain the spread of the virus in the mainland of China. Methods: Based on disease transmission-related parameters, this study was designed to predict the trend of COVID-19 epidemic in the mainland of China and provide theoretical basis for current prevention and control. An SEIQR epidemiological model incorporating asymptomatic transmission, short term immunity and imperfect isolation was constructed to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 inside and outside of Hubei province. With COVID-19 cases confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC), the optimal parameters of the model were set by calculating the minimum Chi-square value.",

The epidemic has spread rapidly across the world [3] [4] [5] . In China, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, in December 2019 [6] [7] [8] . Rapidly, Hubei province became the hardest-hit of the COVID-19 epidemic, due to the high rate of human-to-human transmission [9] [10] [11] , mainly through droplets from coughing or sneezing or body contact. Immediately, the Chinese government took drastic controlling efforts (like public education, active surveillance, early detection, case management, contact tracing, especially mandatory quarantine for at least 14 days [12] ). As of 26 May 2020 (24:00 GMT + 8), 82 993 confirmed cases, 6 suspected cases and 4634 deaths were reported in China, most of them from Hubei province (68 135 confirmed cases and 4512 deaths) [13] . This epidemic is attacking 215 countries and regions around the world, such as USA, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russian Federation, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey, Iran, Canada, Peru, India, Belgium, Netherlands and Republic of Korea. There have appeared 5 404 512 confirmed cases and 343 514 deaths worldwide until 26 May 2020 (10:00 GMT + 2) [14] .",

These findings formulate a SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected but not hospitalized-infectious and isolatedrecovered) epidemic model to explore the impacts of the lockdown of Wuhan and the curb of population migration on COVID-19 transmission. The model was constructed, incorporating asymptomatic transmission, short term immunity and imperfect isolation. The aim of this study was to prove that timely lockdown, large-scale case-screening and other control measures proposed by the Chinese government were effective means to contain the spread of the virus in the mainland of China. Through parameter estimation, we got the parameters of the model. With the aid of sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the timeliness and correctness of the early measures implemented by the Chinese government. Before 25 February 2020, we predicted the epidemic trend in China, and the final number of cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei province and the mainland of China. Up to now, the results have been proved accurate. At the same time, the basic reproduction number of each stage is decreasing, which reflects that the control measures of the Chinese government play a decisive role. Before 25 February, we also gave suggestions on the time for full resumption of work. Although the epidemic is under control, it is not the time to terminate the controlling efforts which are expected to be ended as early as in May.",

For this reason, Hubei province and other provinces are considered into two patches, denoted as 1 and 2, respectively (e.g., seeing [32, 44] ). In each patch, the population related to COVID-19 is divided into five epidemiological subgroups: susceptible, S i ; exposed, E i ; infected but not hospitalized, I i (including suspected, carrier and undetected); infectious and isolated (daily confirmed real-time cases announced by NHC [13] ), Q i ; and recovered (short term immunity), R i . The total population N i = S i + E i + I i + Q i + R i , i = 1,2. In order to better reflect the actual situation of COVID-19 transmission in the mainland of China, we set the following conditions: 1) Natural birth and death are ignored since we only focus on the short-term disease transmission; 2) Asymptomatic transmission [23] [24] [25] [26] is the one mode of transmission of COVID-19; the susceptible (S i ) individuals may be infected due to contacts with the infected but not hospitalized individuals (I i ). The individuals in incubation period (E i ) also have the potential to transmit the virus. Meanwhile, infectious and isolated individuals (Q i ) also have a certain probability to transmit the virus to medical workers and others, which is a phenomenon called imperfect isolation. Therefore, the exposed (E i ) and the infectious and isolated (Q i ) are considered infectious, with infectivity reduction factors k i and l i , respectively; 3) A few infected individuals do not develop obvious symptoms and have no short-term immunity after self-healing [28] , so it is assumed that these individuals (\u03b3 i \u03b7 i I i ) will directly return to the susceptible; 4) Wuhan was locked down off at 10:00 AM, 23 January 2020, and other cities in Hubei province were locked down successively. Xiangyang City in Hubei province was lastly locked down at 00:00 on 27 January 2020. So, the migration rates are considered as follows: 6) Before the lockdown of Hubei province, we consider that infectivity reduction factors (l i , i = 1,2) between medical workers and patients before 26 January is much higher than that after 26 January, due to the shortage of medical resources and the insufficient understanding of COVID-19 transmission:",

On 12 February 2020, NHC advocated the large-scale casescreening of previously suspected cases and reexamination of the diagnostic results, and that the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on three criteria (previously on two): a history of epidemiological contact or a history of stay in the epidemic area, clinical symptoms (such as fever, cough) and CT features. The NHC announced 59 804 confirmed cases nationwide, including 13 332 clinically diagnosed cases on 12 February. In the next 2 days, the number rose to 63 851 (15 384 clinically diagnosed cases) and 66 492 (16 522 clinically diagnosed cases). With the release of the sixth edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 [50] , it was officially announced on February 19 that the original two standards were reused for the diagnosis.

The susceptible population in Hubei province was considered as the permanent population in Wuhan city. According to the statistical yearbook data of Wuhan city [46, 47] , we then assumed S 1 (0) = 1.1 \u00d7 10 7 . According to the cumulative daily case data reported from the NHC [13] , we set Q 1 (0) = 41, R 1 (0) = 2, Q 2 (0) = 0, R 2 (0) = 0. The incubation period (1/ \u03b1 i , i = 1, 2) of COVID-19 was 5.8 days [45] , so transition rate of exposed individuals E i read \u03b1 1 = \u03b1 2 = 0.1724. We consulted the values of k and l in the literature [51] and got the appropriate range of k and l. Considering that the patient's disease course (1/\u03b4 i , i = 1, 2) is about 10 to 30 days, and the time required to detect a suspected patient (1/\u03b3 i , i = 1, 2) is 3 to 10 days, we thus set the ranges of parameters \u03b4 i and \u03b3 i , i = 1, 2, respectively. Based on [34, 37] , the range of transmission rate \u03b2 i , i = 1, 2, was given. Before the lockdown of Wuhan, we assume that 30% (about 300 000) of the total population in Wuhan had traveled to and back home every day from 11 to 22 January. The average time to move out of Wuhan was 1 day. Therefore, the upper limit of the rate of migration out of Wuhan (all citizens moved out, \u03c9) is 0.03 \u00d7 1/1 = 0.03 and the lower limit of the mobility is 1/365 = 0.0027, considering that everyone moves out of Wuhan at least once a year.

At the same time, large-scale case-screening were carried out nationwide, and stricter control measures were implemented in Hubei province to further restrict residents' move. Therefore, we must assess the impact of the large-scale case-screening that began on 12 February. For other provinces, using the model (1) to reflect the impact of the large-scale casescreening, we assumed that only the transmission rate (\u03b2 i , i = 1, 2) was further reduced. Owing to the increasing medical supplies and deepening understanding of the virus, infection in doctors by patients at this time remained extremely rare, so the infectivity reduction factor (l) can be almost ignored (l d = 0.0001) on 12 February (12 February was the 33th day of our simulation). Hence, we used the fewest parameters to characterize the impact of large-scale case-screening on the epidemic. For the confirmed cases of Hubei province on 12 February, it is equivalent to consider that the model has changed its dynamics on that day. Namely, except for the transmission rate (\u03b2 1 ) and infectivity reduction factor (l) change, all variables of the model (1) of Hubei province have changed.

(1) When only Wuhan had confirmed cases at the prophase of the epidemic, we assumed that the number of susceptible individuals on 11 January was the permanent population of Wuhan. With the frequent migration of the population, the epidemic gradually spread across Hubei and China, so there was an increase in the number of susceptible persons before the lockdown of Hubei. But to simplify the discussion of the model, we have omitted this detail. (2) In addition, due to the existence a certain number of asymptomatic infections, the actual number of infections would exceed the confirmed case number released by NHC.",

            "text": "We predicted the impact of the future migration in Hubei province on the epidemic status (see Fig. 7 ). Once the migration restarts, an increase will be observed in the number of susceptible persons and the transmission rate (\u03b2 1 ). We assume that the number of susceptible persons in Hubei will mutate to 10 million. Next, we predicted the cumulative confirmed case at three time points (12 March, 12 April, and 12 May). We only predicted cumulative confirmed case data in the next 2 months. The transmission rates (\u03b2 1 ) will be 0.6, 0.65 and 0.7. It is clear that even with low-level migration (only one million people are susceptible), protective efforts are still needed (the transmission rate is lower than the value of model (1) between January 11 and February 12). Once the migration starts on 12 March (R 0 (1) = 1.4981), the epidemic situation will rise rapidly. If not controlled, the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei province after two natural months will exceed 71 500. If the migration starts on 12 April (R 0 (1) = 1.6229) or 12 May (R 0 (1) = 1.7477), even if the personal protection is Fig. 6 The values of (PRCC) on the outcome of R 0 (1) . All parameter values were derived from 27 January to 11 February 2020 R 0 (1) = 5.6015 R 0 (1) = 6.6037 R 0 (1) = 3.7732 R 0 (1) = 0.2020 R 0 (2) = 2.5697 R 0 (2) = 1.1067 R 0 (2) = 0.9943 R 0 (2) = 0.0472 R 0 = 5.6015 R 0 = 6.6037 --slightly loose (the transmission rate increases in order), the epidemic seriousness will change relatively little within the next two natural months. Therefore, the current controlling efforts should not be eliminated too earlier. After the epidemic rampancy is completely controlled, theoretically, as long as sufficient precautions are taken (the transmission rate \u03b2 1 is less than 0.4005 and the basic reproduction number is just less than 1), the epidemic situation will not break out again. We obtained the research results on 25 February 2020, a day on which the epidemic in China was not completely quelled, and the global pandemic had not taken shape. At this stage, people cared about the time of the inflection point, the final number of cumulative confirmed cases, the time when the epidemic ended and normal daily activity resumed. In the current global pandemic, China is facing up with imported cases, asymptomatic infections, reinfection of confirmed patients and so on. The Chinese government has issued a series of countering measures, but we have not evaluated them and their impacts on future COVID-19 control, which will be our new research topic.",

The lockdown of Hubei province resulted in a significant reduction in the basic reproduction number. The large-scale case-screening also shows the effectiveness in the epidemic control. The restart of population migration may bring with a risk of second outbreak. This shows that COVID-19 can be fundamentally controlled till its extinction. Although the epidemic is subsiding in China, the controlling efforts should not be terminated before May. This might provide experiences that can be replicated by other countries suffering from the pandemic. ",

It can be seen that the experimental numbers are greater than the actual numbers. And we see that due to the large-scale case-screening on 12 February, the system switches its pattern again. The cumulative confirmed cases of Hubei province and the mainland of China (blue dotted line) are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Based on this conjecture, the cumulative number of confirmed cases nationwide was 82 186, and 69 230 in Hubei province on 9 April. This scenario validates the necessity of largescale case-screening. 4) Wuhan locked down, Hubei locked down, largescale case-screening taken: After Hubei province was locked down, we estimated that S 1 (17) = 3.25 \u00d7 10 4 , S 2 (17) = 1.02 \u00d7 10 4 . After the initiation of large-scale case-screening, we estimated that S 1 (33) = 1.94 \u00d7 10 3 , E 1 (33) = 1.83 \u00d7 10 3 , I 1 (33) = 4.24 \u00d7 10 3 , Q 1 (33) = 6.18 \u00d7 10 4 , R 1 (33) = 6.55 \u00d7 10 4 . Fitted with Matlab (solid purple lines), we estimated the real cases of Hubei province and the mainland of China (Figs. 4 and 5).
