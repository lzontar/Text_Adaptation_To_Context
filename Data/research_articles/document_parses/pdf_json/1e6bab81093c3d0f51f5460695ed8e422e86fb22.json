This study aimed at developing short-term forecasting models of daily ambulance calls using the 7-day weather forecast data as predictors. We employed the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method to analyze over 1.3 million cases of emergency attendance in May 2006 through April 2009 and the 7-day weather forecast data for the same period. Our results showed that the ARIMA model could offer reasonably accurate forecasts of daily ambulance calls at 1-7 days ahead of time and with improved accuracy by including weather factors. Specifically, the inclusion of average temperature alone in our ARIMA model improved the predictability of the 1-day forecast when compared to that of a simple ARIMA model (8.8 % decrease in the root mean square error, RMSE=53 vs 58). The improvement in the 7-day forecast with average temperature as a predictor was more pronounced, with a 10 % drop in prediction error (RMSE=62 vs 69). These findings suggested that weather forecast data can improve the 1-to 7-day forecasts of daily ambulance demand. As weather forecast data are readily accessible from Hong Kong Observatory's official website, there is virtually no cost to including them in the ARIMA models, which yield better prediction for forward planning and deployment of ambulance manpower.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "That the weather impacts on our daily lives is a known fact.

Baker and Fitzpatrick (1986) attempted separate forecasts on daily emergency and nonemergency ambulance demand using an exponential smoothing model developed originally by Winters (Saydam et al. 1986 ) and then combined the two into a single forecast through goal programming. Four months of data on daily ambulance demand from September to December 1982 were used to forecast daily demand in January and February of 1983. When comparing the mean square errors, the technique of goal programming seemed to outperform multiple linear regression models. Tandberg et al. (1998) employed different time series methods (based on moving averages, means with moving average smoothing, and autoregressive integrated moving averages) to estimate the hourly volumes of ambulance runs. Hourly ambulance statistics in 1994 were used to develop forecast models, and similar statistics in 1995 were used to test and validate the models. The results indicated that time series by \"means with moving average smoothing\" yielded the best performance, with 54.3 % of the variance explained. Liao et al. (2002) considered weather factors with the back-propagation neural network to predict daily ambulance runs. They employed daily ambulance records from 1996 to 1997 in model development and 1998 records in model validation. Their models based on time-series data were able to predict ambulance runs to within 6 % error on average. Channouf et al. (2007) compared the forecast accuracy of two time series models: (1) an autoregressive model based on ambulance data with trend effects of seasonality and specialday removed; and (2) a doubly seasonal ARIMA model with special-day effects included. Their models were derived using 36 months of data and validated based on data in the subsequent 14 months. The results suggested that the first model was better, with a smaller root mean square error (RMSE) at 13.91 and an insignificant average absolute percentage error (AAPE) of 5.72 %.

Their forecasting model confirmed that relative humidity and rainfall were significantly associated with disease incidence. Time-series modeling was also adopted by Ajdacic-Gross et al.

Indeed, the general utility of time-series modeling by adequately trained non-specialists has contributed to its popularity (Allard 1998) . In this paper, we have employed a series of linear time-series forecasting models that allow for the inclusion of predictor variables in estimating daily ambulance calls of Hong Kong.

Here, the effectiveness of using HKO's 7-day weather forecast data to predict ambulance demand for the coming days is compared against that using retrospective and actual weather data.

Weather forecast data could be incorporated into the FGMS without additional cost by linking directly to the HKO website. The incorporation of weather forecast data is worthwhile because its inclusion will improve forecast accuracy to better gauge resource management and deployment of ambulance attendants. For example, if the HKO 7-day weather forecasts warned of declining average temperatures in the next week and the ambulance demand forecast system predicted an increasing demand for ambulance services, such information would alert the need for advanced planning and estimation of a sufficient number of ambulance attendants required for the occasion. Such forward planning would enhance employee communication and reduce the need for compensation payment due to cancellation of previously approved leaves.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusions"}, {"text": "There are few studies about the joint decision-making processes of forecasters and emergency managers during severe weather events (e.g., see Baumgart et al. 2008 ).

Medical care of na on-recurrent nature due to extreme weather conditions must not be neglected. In an emergency situation when lives are endangered, a 12-hour difference is important 1 day out but becomes less important the farther out the forecast is. Given that the present day FSD does not provide forecasts of daily ambulance demand, our forecasting model b' is helpful for the agency or the managing authority to know beforehand and be better prepared for the expected rise in the demand for emergency ambulances arising from changing weather conditions.
