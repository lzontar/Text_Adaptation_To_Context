If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. In appreciating these 'capacity-dependent' deaths, this paper reports on the clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. With application to a large public hospital in England during an early stage of the pandemic, the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity. Based on information available at the time, results suggest that total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75% through a combination of increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds, reducing length of stay by 25%, and flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day. Accounting for the additional 'capacity-independent' deaths, which occur even when appropriate care is available within the intensive care setting, yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 30%. The modelling tool, which is freely available and open source, has since been used to support COVID-19 response planning at a number of healthcare systems within the UK National Health Service.",

Unchecked, with a basic reproduction rate (R0) estimated at various magnitudes up to 6.5 [3, 4] and up to 14.7% of those infected requiring hospitalisation [5] , the virus can propagate rapidly through a population, leading to peaks in demand for hospital care which are simply not possible to match with existing capacity [2, 3] . If, at such times, patients are unable to access the bedded care required then otherwise-avoidable death is likely to result [6] . The likelihood of this is particularly heightened when intensive care beds are required, since the necessary invasive ventilation and organ support cannot readily or safely be delivered in other settings [7] . Early case fatality rates from Wuhan are not expected to appreciate these capacity-dependent deaths (i.e. deaths that can be attributed to a patient unable to access the care they need due to lack of available capacity), since drastic efforts were taken by authorities to avoid health services becoming overwhelmed, in enforcing restrictions on movement and rapidly upscaling capacity through the building of two new hospitals [8] . Without improved treatment options, there is little that can be done to reduce COVID-19 deaths occurring when the patient has otherwise been cared for in the most appropriate hospital setting (i.e. capacity-independent deathssee Fig. 1 ), and so national and local planners should focus on minimising the capacitydependent deaths that are within their influence. That is, efforts should be made to ensure the right level of care is available to patients at the right time.",

On the demand side, in absence of the means to treat or prevent disease, the slowing down of cases requiring admission using measures such as school closures and social distancing can reduce peak excess demand for intensive care, the socalled 'flattening the curve' [1] . On the supply side, efforts to create new and expand existing intensive care units increases the capacity to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, resulting in fewer patients rejected with either no care or care in a sub-optimal setting (which increases the risk of death).",

Healthcare service planners and managers need to be cognisant of the likely benefits of their options around the flexing of bedded capacity, especially regarding the allocation between acute and intensive care beds (where the substantial efforts involved in increasing the latter must be well justified). With an appropriate model, the effect of these scenarios can be projected and used to make better informed strategic decisions when planning the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

[3] provide a detailed model of demand and the resulting deaths under various mitigation strategies, their work assumes a fixed mortality rate that is not dependent on the available capacity of the healthcare system.

            "text": "Computer simulations of patient flow, demand and capacity have been used extensively to inform decision-making in healthcare [13] [14] [15] [16] . This is especially true for the stochastic, discrete-event approach to simulation, as it is particularly suited to situations where entities (e.g. patients) 'compete' for limited resources such as hospital beds and operating room time [17] . Many simulation studies that have tackled questions around demand and capacity in healthcare, both under typical health system conditions (for example [18, 19] ) and in periods of increased pressure such as mass casualty events [20] and winter bed crises [21, 22] . Specifically in the context of intensive care, simulation studies have addressed bed requirements by using the system dynamics simulation approach to evaluate different management policies [23] , and applying analytical queuing models and simulations to the management of patient flow [24, 25] . For a general guide of how simulation modelling may be used in responding to the challenges of COVID-19, refer to [26] . This paper reports on the development and early real-life application of a purpose-built computer simulation model, designed for evaluating scenarios to mitigate capacity-dependent deaths in intensive care resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Development of the model is covered in Sect. 2 alongside data requirements for model parameterisation and the scenarios considered for the simulation experiments. Illustrative results, obtained from application to a large teaching hospital in England at an early stage of the outbreak, are presented in Sect. 3. Finally, Sect. 4 contains a discussion on practical application, limitations, and possible further development of the model and tool.",

That is, patients requiring intensive care are rejected if there is no available service channel (bed). In Kendall's notation [27] this is an M(t)/G/C/C queuing system: that is, in turn, a timeinhomogeneous Poisson arrivals process representing the epidemic curve for cases requiring intensive care admission; a general service distribution approximating patient length of stay in intensive care; C service channels; and a total system capacity of C patients, i.e. no space for waiting. For rejected intensive care presentations (lost arrivals), death occurs with probability P rej d and survival with probability 1\u2212P rej d . For admitted intensive care presentations, death occurs with probability P adm d and survival with probability 1\u2212P adm d . Implementation of this model is through the iterative threephased method of discrete event simulation [28] . In the case of this study, the types of simulation event consist of: (a) Arrival of patient requiring intensive care admission (unconditional event) (b) Patient admitted to intensive care (conditional event) (c) Patient died within intensive care (unconditional event) (d) Patient discharged alive from intensive care (unconditional event) (e) Patient admission rejected and patient died (conditional event) (f) Patient admission rejected and patient survived (conditional event)",

This could be arrival or intensive care discharge or death (i.e. event type a, c or d as above). In the second phase the selected event is executed. In the third phase, any associated conditional event is also executed. So, for example, if a patient arrives (event type a) and there is an available service channel (e.g. a free intensive care bed) then the conditional event is that the patient is admitted (event type b) and the associated bed is flagged as unavailable. If, instead, there is no available service channel (bed) then the admission is rejected and the simulated patient either dies (event type e) or ultimately survives (event type f).",

This involved adjusting for local population size, demographics and hospital catchment area (Table 1) in our effort to interpret the national demand profiles. As similarly performed in [30] , such data preprocessing was necessary given the absence of more granular projections during the early stages of the outbreak. The modelling reported in this study made use of two hypothetical strategies contained in [3]a 'do nothing' and one involving 'case isolation, home quarantine, and social distancing of those over 70'. The modelling also considers a 'flattened' version of this latter strategy, in order to appreciate the possibility that measures would have a greater effect than envisaged in slowing transmission of the disease, with the same level of demand but over a 50% longer period of time (Fig. 2) .",

The shape and rate parameters were estimated at \u03b1 = 1.66 and \u03b2 = 0.206 respectively, giving rise to a median of 6.52 days and mean of 8.07 days (note the mean is similar to the 8 day mean used in [30] ). The probability of death resulting from rejected admission to intensive care (P rej d ) was also informed by the literature. Given the pivotal dependence of survival on mechanical ventilation [6] and already substantial mortality rates for cases actually receiving such intervention [31] , it was assumed that all but a very small minority of rejected admissions would result in death. For the simulation study conducted here, a figure of P rej d \u00bc 0:99 is used based on the clinical advice received from practicing intensive care consultants (noting the assumption that transfer to another hospital with available intensive care capacity could not take place). Finally, the probability that a COVID-19 patient admitted to intensive care dies within intensive care (P adm d ) is estimated at P adm d \u00bc 0:507, based on such a proportion of intensive care admissions having died as sourced from the afore-mentioned observational report representing 4078 intensive care admissions [31] .",

These relate to changes in the epidemic curve for cases requiring intensive care (informed by government-led strategy regarding isolation, quarantine and social distancing), capacity at the hospital in terms of number of intensive care beds, and patient length of stay in intensive care. The No isolation strategy involving no government-led effort with respect to isolation, quarantine and social distancing is considered within Scenario 1, alongside the current available capacity of 45 beds and the literature-informed gamma-distributed length of stay with mean 8.07 days [31] . Given the UK Government's Scenarios 3 and 4 model the hospital's actual planned increases in intensive care bed numbers to surge capacities of 76 and 100 respectively. Scenario 5 models the potential benefits of reducing COVID-19 length of stay by 25% through use of weaning protocols for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, as estimated in a previous study [32] . In exploring sensitivity of model outputs to length of stay, an increase of 25% was also considered (Scenario 6) in order to appreciate the effect of possible delays to discharge that reasonably may exist [33] . In appreciating the possibility that nonpharmaceutical interventions would have a greater effect than envisaged in slowing transmission of the disease under the Isolation strategy, the remainder of considered scenarios are based upon the 'flattened' version as introduced in Sect. 2.2 ( Fig. 2 ). Scenarios 7 through 9 account for this in respect of the various surge capacities (45, 76, 100 beds), with Scenario 10 presenting the 'best case' option in bringing together this flattened demand accompanied by increased capacity to 100 beds and 25% reduced length of stay.",

Employing these measures reduces capacitydependent deaths by an estimated three-fifths and cuts the peak daily capacity-dependent deaths by 69% ceteris paribus (Scenario 2). Incorporating capacity-independent deaths (occurring within intensive care following admission), total deaths over the pandemic are reduced by 2182 (54%). Increasing capacity from 45 to 76 intensive care beds (Scenario 3) further reduces capacity-dependent deaths by 307 (20%), with total deaths reducing by a lesser 150 (8%) given the additional capacity-independent deaths that consequently occur (recalling P adm d \u00bc 0:507 ). This also starts to reduce the number of subsequent days at maximum capacity, from 76 to 64 (16%). This is brought down further (to 56 days) should capacity increases to 100 beds be possible (Scenario 4), which also brings down capacity-dependent deaths to under 1000 and reduces total deaths by approximately 100. Curtailing mean length of stay by one-quarter appears to have a relatively small improvement to the total number of deaths (Scenario 5 c.f. Scenario 2), which is in part due to the rightskewed nature of the length of stay distribution (i.e. the number of longer-staying patients in the tail is unchanged since the shape of the distribution is presumed unaltered). When intensive care length of stay is increased by one-quarter (Scenario 6 c.f. Scenario 2), the additional 98 (6.5%) capacity-dependent deaths are offset by fewer capacity-independent deaths given the reduced intensive care throughput, resulting in a lesser 47 (2.5%) total deaths. Should any additional government-led isolation strategies be effective in further flattening the epidemic curve for cases requiring intensive care, then a substantial reduction in peak capacity-dependent deaths from 33 to 20 would be expected (i.e. Scenario 7 c.f. Scenario 2). However, without increases to capacity this simply spreads the deaths over a longer period of time, rather than reducing the total by a significant amount (1750 c.f. 1849). To achieve a significant reduction in total deaths then any further 'flattening' of demand must be accompanied by increases in capacity. If first and second surge capacity levels can be met then total deaths reduce by 198 (11%) and 322 (18%) respectively (i.e. Scenarios 8 and 9 c.f. Scenario 7). Finally, if second surge bed numbers can be accompanied by the afore-mentioned one-quarter reduction in length of stay then total deaths can be reduced by 454 (26%), peak capacity-dependent deaths reduced to ten per day, and the duration of time operating at full capacity shortened by one half (Scenario 10 c.f. Scenario 7) . Note that while further 'flattening' of demand and accompanying capacity increases lead to greater capacity-independent deaths (due to higher numbers admitted) this is more than offset by the reduction in capacity-dependent deaths, meaning total deaths are reduced.",

Thus under an Isolation (flattened) strategy with 25% reduced length of stay and 100 beds (Scenario 10), the total number of deaths is within 185 (15%) of the theoretical lower bound (at least in the absence of vaccine or treatment). The peak bed requirement corresponding to these lower bound mortality estimates under the three strategies are 853 (704 to 1012), 303 (243 to 363) and 206 (163 to 250) respectively (Fig. 4 ).",

In implementing the model as an open source tool, the approach has been used across a number of healthcare systems within the UK National Health Service. This has been facilitated through making the model code publicly available as an R package [34] and promoting the tool through social media and national webinar series [35] .",

First, it has enabled a more objective assessment of the potential gain from efforts required to convert existing clinical areas to intensive care specification. This has allowed consideration of the opportunity cost of such actions, e.g. if theatre space is used then this may limit the ability to perform emergency surgery. Second, it has facilitated consideration of the gain from investing in efforts to reduce length of stay through potentially-effective weaning protocols [32] . Third, it has enabled consideration of the effect of delays to discharge that may reasonably exist from intensive care to downstream services [33] , particularly in the COVID-19 setting where other acute and community services may be overwhelmed. Fourth, it has informed an understanding of workforce requirements, through measuring the duration of time at maximum occupancy (and thus Fig. 3 Simulation output results for intensive care bed occupancy and projected capacity-dependent and capacity-independent deaths (per day and cumulative) across the ten scenarios considered. Black solid lines represent the mean and grey bands the 95% confidence intervals from 1000 replications per scenario. Dashed lines represent inputted capacity associated with the respective scenarios estimating staff burnout [36] ). Fifth, through sharing the modelling results with public health colleagues at various stages of the modelling, it has informed the capacity requirements of temporary mortuaries within the region. And sixth, through estimating the reduction of COVID-19 related occupancy, it has facilitated consideration of the timing and scale of when certain elective surgeries may resume.",

If the higher volumes of patients being looked after, as produced here through scenarios in which more beds are converted to intensive care specification, are not met with proportionate increases in the numbers of suitably-qualified doctors and nurses, then poorer patient outcomes (i.e. greater P adm d ) and longer lengths of stay may result [39] . Further research is thus required to investigate and incorporate the effect of workforce size and skill-mix on these model parameters. On the demand side, these parameters may also be affected by the possible implementation of an intensive care triage policy, which would result in a different case-mix admitted to intensive care. Additional modelling may thus be needed to understand the effects of rejecting intensive care admissions from patient cohorts known to have negligible survival likelihood, in the interests of maintaining available beds for those known to have more favourable chances. If those patients less likely to benefit from admission are triaged-out (as considered in [6, 40] ), then modelling would need to capture the different outcome and length of stay distributions for the new patient cohort. Ultimately, such a policy could potentially reduce further the total deaths over and above those considered in this study.",

Firstly, any confounding in the empirically-calibrated length of stay distribution should be assessed, in examining the extent to which discharge delays are already accounted for within the length of stay data. This would require patient-level data including admission date and date ready for discharge alongside ultimate discharge date. While a 25% (2-day) addition to length of stay has been considered here (Scenario 6), further research could consider modelling the downstream acute bed base in order to assess the capacity required to reduce delays to discharge to a given length of time (with greater fidelity achievable through modelling the conjoint admission and discharge process between Fig. 4 Simulation output results for no constraint to bed number availability.
