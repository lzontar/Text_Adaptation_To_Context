In the MARINER study, data on arterial events were captured using a standardized data collection form, and all suspected events were centrally adjudicated using pre-specified criteria. Although exploratory, our analysis suggests that extended thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban in medically ill patients may lead to reductions in arterial thromboembolic events (primarily ischemic stroke) as well as a reduction in symptomatic VTE. Such a finding is in line with the results of the APEX trial (12), which in post hoc analyses revealed a w30% reduction in fatal and irreversible ischemic events (including PE, MI, nonfatal ischemic stroke, or CV death) without an increase in fatal or intracranial hemorrhage, and a w50% reduction in ischemic stroke with betrixaban compared with placebo (6,7). A recent pooled analysis of both the MARINER and MAGELLAN trials of extended thromboprophylaxis with the 10 mg dose of rivaroxaban also revealed a significant 22% reduction in allcause mortality and major thromboembolic events, including symptomatic VTE, MI, and nonhemorrhagic stroke (1.80% vs. 2.31%; HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.97; p \u00bc 0.024), without an increase in critical site or fatal bleeding (13). The association between VTE and arterial thromboembolic disease has been well-established (5,14). Underlying common mechanisms of both VTE and arterial thromboembolism suggest that primary thromboprophylaxis using an established anticoagulant regimen, possibly against a background of antiplatelet therapy and given for a sufficient duration, can be effective in reducing both types of events. An analysis of MARINER data in the subset of patients receiving rivaroxaban plus aspirin, although not randomized for aspirin use and hypothesis generating, suggested greater efficacy with rivaroxaban plus aspirin in reducing symptomatic VTE and VTErelated death (15). In the COMPASS (Rivaroxaban for the Prevention of Major Cardiovascular Events in Coronary or Peripheral Artery Disease; NCT01776424) trial, a very large study that compared 2.5 mg twice daily of rivaroxaban plus 100 mg aspirin daily with 100 mg aspirin daily alone in patients with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease, rivaroxaban plus aspirin significantly reduced the incidence of CV death, stroke, and MI by 24% (16). This dose of rivaroxaban would be predicted to produce trough levels similar to those achieved with 10 mg once daily (17,18); this finding was supported by data from the MARINER pharmacokinetic substudy in patients receiving the 10 mg dose (9). Our findings may have important implications for the population of medically ill patients now that rivaroxaban is approved for extended post-hospital discharge thromboprophylaxis in at-risk medically ill patients in the United States. A previous benefit/ risk assessment of a low-bleed risk subpopulation of the MAGELLAN trial revealed that extended thromboprophylaxis with the 10 mg dose of rivaroxaban would lead to 21 fewer fatal and major thromboembolic events per 10,000 patients at the expense of 9 more critical site or fatal bleeds, with a number needed to treat of 481 and number needed to harm of 1,061", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": ", unlike the dose of 10 mg, which had previously been demonstrated to be effective in the MAGELLAN (Venous Thromboembolic Event [VTE] Prophylaxis in Medically Ill Patients; NCT00571649) study of extended thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients (9). A pre-specified secondary endpoint of the trial was fatal and major venous and arterial thromboembolic events (8). Therefore, this exploratory analysis focused on whether rivaroxaban could reduce the incidence of fatal and major thromboembolic events in patients treated with 10 mg daily of rivaroxaban compared with placebo when given to acutely ill medical patients at the time of discharge for 45 days.
