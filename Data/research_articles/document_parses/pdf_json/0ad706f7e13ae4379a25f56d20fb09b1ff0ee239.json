'Complicated grief' is characterised by intense grief, which can last longer than socially expected or cause impairment in daily functioning. 2 Risk factors that can contribute to 'complicated grief', include, but are not exclusive, to the following: 1) Nature of death e.g. sudden, traumatic or violent resulting in a lack of preparedness or limiting the opportunity to 'say goodbye' 2 ; 2) Nature of the environment e.g. limited end-of-life care discussions, 'aggressive' medical care, concurrent caring demands or other stressors such as financial costs 3, 4 and 3) Pre-existing factors in the bereaved person e.g. low levels of social support, mental health concerns. 2 Internationally, there is variability in the allocation of bereavement support services. Within certain healthcare systems, a 'blanket' approach to bereavement support is offered by palliative care -but this means the same level of support is offered to everyone, regardless of need and without identification of those at most risk of complicated grief. 5 Specific factors associated with COVID-19 related deaths could potentially increase the risk of an adverse outcome in bereavement, such as a more intense or prolonged grief reaction.",

Studies tended to focus on 'survivors' of the illness i.e. those who had had the illness and recovered and their subsequent psychological well-being. It was recognised, however, that these survivors could also be bereaved people and indeed some of them may have experienced multiple bereavements. 13 For example, one study reported 13/143 (9%) of people attending a nurseled mental health out-patient clinic were relatives of the deceased or survivors. 12 The paper described that both groups presented with normal grief or mild depressive or anxiety symptoms. They also reported on the stigma and discrimination these individuals had faced within their communities. 12",
