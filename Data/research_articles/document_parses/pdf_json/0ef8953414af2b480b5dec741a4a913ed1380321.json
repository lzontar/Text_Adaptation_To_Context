An hypothesis could be that B cells are intrinsically involved in autoimmune pathogenesis mediated by mimicry due to their role as APC and thus cross-reactive B cell responses may be crucial to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease because they present mimicking epitopes to T cells. Mamula and colleagues described two experi-ments in which either human snRNP or cytochrome C was used to prime an immune response in mice against the non-self protein and as a result, an immune response to the self protein was elicited. Immunization with the murine protein could not induce a T or B cell response to the murine protein but immunization with the human homologue caused antibody production to the murine protein. Transfer of self reactive B cells to naive mice facilitated a T cell response to the murine protein in recipients. ^\"^ ' ^'' The importance of this research is that an autoimmune response was induced by a foreign molecule with only slight antigenie differences from the self molecule. Similarly, mimicking epitopes of pathogens could in theory induce a B cell response to the mimic that can present antigen to T cells and break the mechanisms that are normally maintaining the self tolerance. James el al,^^^ injected a single peptide of auto-antigen RNP Sm B/B' into numerous rabbits and antibodies to a range of epitopes from that molecule and other RNP were induced over time. It has been noted that six regions ofthe 60 kDa Ro antigen in SLE share sequence similarity with the nucleocapsid (N) protein ofthe vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) purported to be implicated in SLE. Immunization of rabbits with the VSV N protein induced antibodies reactive with the N protein and the similar Ro antigen. Repeated immunization with the N protein induced antibodies to numerous Ro peptides including ones that did not share sequence similarity.'^\"^ It was inferred that the N protein activated cross-reactive B cells that recognized the Ro antigen and then acted as antigen presenting cells priming T cells to other Ro peptides which in turn provided help to other B cells thus resulting in epitope spreading. It would follow then that a mimicking antigen, similar in only one epitope, may initiate a primary crossreactive response to that epitope that subsequently results in recognition of numerous epitopes in the mimicked host protein. If this were to be the case, one would expect that autoimmune diseases would be characterized by responses to many epitopes and the initial target would be difficult to determine. Recognition of multiple antigens and epitopes is evident in IDDM. SLE, RA, PBC and probably most autoimmune diseases. Clinical studies arc usually conducted in the phase of pathogenesis when multiple epitopes and antigens are recognized by polyclonal T and B cell responses.
