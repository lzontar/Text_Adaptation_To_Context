Our robust sampling, which included over 40 starting structures spanning the spectrum from the extended unfolded state to the native fold, yielded nearly 120 s of cumulative sampling time. Conformational microstate transitions on the 1.0 ns to 10.0 s timescales were observed, with post-equilibration sampling providing detailed representations of the conformational free energy landscape and the complex folding mechanism inherent to the pseudoknot motif. Herein, we identify and characterize two alternative native structures, three intermediate states, and numerous misfolded states, the latter of which have not previously been characterized via atomistic simulation techniques. While in line with previous thermodynamics-based models of a general RNA folding mechanism, our observations indicate that stem-strand-sequence-separation may serve as an alternative predictor of the order of stem formation during pseudoknot folding. Our results contradict a model of frameshifting based on structural rigidity and resistance to mechanical unfolding, and instead strongly support more recent studies in which conformational plasticity is identified as a determining factor in frameshifting efficiency.",

Discovery of RNA pseudoknots began in the late 1970s with the observation of tRNA mimicry by the 3 terminal pseudoknot of Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus (TYMV) (1), which shares neither primary nor secondary structure with tRNA Val , yet achieves recognition by tRNA Val -specific enzymes (2, 3) . Mimicry-capable RNAs, such as TYMV, showcase the potential dominance of three-dimensional topology, rather than primary or secondary structure, in determining the biological activity of RNAs (4) .",

Frameshifting, including -1 PRF, is now understood to be enabled through the presence of two fundamental motifs in viral mRNA during translation: an upstream heptanucleotide slippery sequence, where the pausing of the ribosome and displacement of the reading frame occurs, and a downstream stimulatory element (the pseudoknot).",

PLRV is classified within the Luteoviridae family and shares the Polerovirus genus with beet western yellow virus (BWYV), a widely known and highly studied RNA pseudoknot. The PLRV used herein (PDB 2A43, shown in Figure 1B) is an X-ray crystallographic structure which possesses C17U/A18C mutations that greatly enhance its frameshifting efficiency (9) . This PLRV exhibits considerable structural and spatial homology with BWYV (17), making it a strong candidate for studies in RNA folding and dynamics, and pseudoknot structure-activity analysis, such as understanding the role of conformational dynamics in -1 PRF.",

While PLRV has been shown to fold in the absence of divalent ions (21) , it is possible that Mg 2+ , a requirement for the folding of many RNAs, would change the folding behavior of PLRV. Although a comparison of the conformational stabilities and dynamics in the presence and absence of Mg 2+ is beyond the scope of the current study, this comparison is a target for future investigation. Steepest-descent energy minimization was followed by solvation in a periodic 75\u00c5 cubic box with \u223c13500 TIP3P water molecules (22) to capture both the bulk and molecular properties of the ionic aqueous solvent, which was then annealed with the RNA held fixed for 1.0 ns prior to the collection of production simulations. All simulations were run in the NPT ensemble (23) at 1 atm and 300 K using a 2.0 fs timestep with bonds constrained using the LINCS algorithm (24) and conformations stored every 100 ps. No artificial or biasing potentials or restraints were employed.",

The population of each conformational microstate as a function of time within our simulated ensemble was monitored, with approximate conformational equilibrium reached at 6.0 ns ( Figure 3 ). We emphasize that the approximate equilibrium suggested in Figure 3 represents a steady-state within our simulated ensemble on the 100 s timescale. Transitions involving larger free energy barriers and longer timescales may, therefore, have gone unobserved within our ensemble simulations. To confirm steady-state behavior, the transition probability and rate matrices, representing the moves from each microstate i to each microstate j after the equilibration period, were evaluated and demonstrated both time-independence and detailed balance. Postequilibration sampling, which included over 50 s of simulation time, was therefore used to evaluate the thermodynamics, kinetics, and folding mechanism of the pseudoknot motif.",

Simulations were considered as part of the native state ensemble if they maintained an all-atom RMSD below 5.0\u00c5, thereby yielding a total native state simulation time of 8.44 s across 1175 simulations. Native contacts for each conformation were then identified for the full pseudoknot structure and for each substructure within the pseudoknot motif. The resulting native contact counts were then normalized using the mean number of native contacts observed in native state simulations; for tertiary (T) native contacts and those in Loop 2 (L2), both of which displayed multi-modal distributions, normalization was done using the maximum in the highest-valued peak in the NC distribution. Contacts between atomic pairs not observed in the simulated native state ensemble were classified as non-native contacts (NNC), an atomic-level analog of the recently-published NNC definition of Mouro et al. (29) , and normalized using the largest quantity of non-native contacts observed. We emphasize that this latter normalization of nonnative contacts may understate the overall degree of nonnative character, and thus the degree of misfolding, present within a given structure.

These free energy landscapes were visualized, using only postequilibration data from our simulated ensemble, by defining the free energy as F = -RT ln Pr at 300 K, where Pr is the normalized probability of finding structures at a given location on the energy landscape. Partitioning of the fourdimensional space depicted in Figure 4 led to the identification of 11 conformational macrostates. In describing these macrostates below, and as labeled in Figure 4C , capital F, I, M and U labels were used to denote folded, intermediate, misfolded and unfolded states, respectively, with numeric subscripts ranging from most native (lower subscript values) to least native (higher subscript values). The overall native and non-native character of these 11 macrostates, alongside the mean native character of substructures within the pseudoknot motif, are provided in Table 1 . Figure 4C and D, which represent structures with low RMSD, high NC, and zero NNC, demonstrate the presence of two alternative folded states (NC > 90%, RMSD < 5\u00c5). The state denoted as F 1 averages only \u223c2.0\u00c5 RMSD from the crystal structure and contains a well-structured Loop 2 region. In contrast, the state labeled F 2 , with an average RMSD of \u223c3.7\u00c5 RMSD from the crystal structure, contains a significantly less-structured Loop 2 region and increased native tertiary contacts ( Table 1) . As tertiary structure in the PLRV pseudoknot is formed predominantly through interactions of Loop 2 bases with the minor groove of Stem 1 (S1) to form a 'triple helix' structure (21) , which has been observed in other pseudoknots (30) , our observation of alternating Loop 2 and tertiary contacts suggests a twisting mode in which either Loop 2 or tertiary contacts may be optimally sampled to increase the overall stability of the pseudoknot fold.",

As the mean quantity of non-native contacts for U 1 was 32.7(\u00b115.2)% (Table 1) , it could be argued that this is a misfolded rather than unfolded state. Our classification of U 1 as an unfolded state is based primarily upon the presence of this state along the folding pathway, in which it readily transitions to and from the less-native U 2 state and the I 3 intermediate described above, as well as the observation that nearly half of the detected non-native contacts within this state occur between the first three residues (5 terminus) and the five residues directly succeeding them, indicating dominance of highly accessible local interactions rather than long-range or large scale structure formation.",

A strong correlation between the formation of Loop 2 and tertiary contacts is evident in Figure 7C at low to moderate native contact values, with somewhat larger quantities of tertiary contacts and somewhat fewer Loop 2 contacts seemingly favored, suggesting that the formation of tertiary structure prompts further formation of Loop 2 structure. In contrast, at high native contact values the existence of alternative states that favor either increased Loop 2 structure or increased tertiary structure, but not both, reinforces our prior description of the transition between the alternative F 1 and F 2 native states. Given the quantitative descriptions of the observed intermediates above, alongside our sampling of the free energy landscape shown in Figure  7D , it can be inferred that Stem 2 largely forms prior to both Loop 2 and tertiary contact formation, but may also form later in the folding process, in tandem with the initiation of Loop 2 and tertiary contacts. The folding mechanics reported herein are consistent with the unfolding of BWYV described by recent optical tweezer experiments and steered molecular dynamics simulations (46), and add a new level of complexity by accounting for the formation of non-native structure. The presence of multiple misfolded states on the free energy surface is in agreement with the PK5 pseudoknot pathway reported by Cao et al. (47) , as well as the broadly applicable Kinetic Partitioning Mechanism (KPM) put forth by Thirumalai et al., in which a population of unfolded molecules is assumed to split into two distinct groups that fold on different time scales defined by the presence of multiple intermediates and misfolds (48) (49) (50) . From Figure 6 , our ensemble simulations predict individual molecular folding events occurring on the hundreds-of-nanoseconds (along the most rapid pathway) to the multiple-microseconds timescales.",

It was also suspected that the U17-C18-A19 linker region plays an important role in initiating ribosomal contact based on proximity to the 5 terminus and intermolecular association observed during crystallization (9) . As with U12 and A19, the U17 and C18 residues remained virtually unchanged between states F 1 and F 2 , and these residues displayed no significant non-native intramolecular associations within our observed macrostate ensembles. Unlike U12 and A19, however, the U17-C18 pair demonstrates high rigidity (low RMSF in Figure 5A ), which derives from -stacking of these bases and the G3\u00b7C16-A20 base-triplet at the 5 terminus of Stem 1. These observations are consistent with the speculation noted above, with U12 and A19 being most suitable for ribosomal recognition when remaining looped-out and flexible, while the much more rigid U17 and C18 residues serve to anchor the looped-out position of A19 for recognition with the ribosomal machinery.",

This agrees well with our observations of PLRV where Stem 1, which is composed solely of G\u00b7C base-pairs, demonstrates high structural rigidity (low RMSF in Figure 5A ), and supports a mechanism based on ribosomal recognition via loopedout viral mRNA nucleotides: ample destabilization of Stem 1, and fraying or destruction of 5 terminal G3\u00b7C16-A20 base-triplet interactions, would disrupt the structure of the U17-C18-A19 linker, leading to potential dislocation of A19 from the looped-out position needed for suitable positioning relative to the ribosome. Analogously, destabilization of the opposite end of Stem 1, the G6\u00b7C13-A24 basetriplet, could have a similar impact on the looped-out U12 residue.",

While the direct result of this mutation would allow for increased preference for contiguous A-stacking within Loop 2, an indirect result of this increased Loop 2 structural stabilization would be an enhanced preference to maintain the looped-out nucleotide atop Loop 2, keeping that residue in place to interact with the ribosome. In addition, SRV-1 displays a third base-triplet between an adenine in Loop 2 and a G\u00b7C base pair that acts as the linker between Stems 1 and 2. This linker region in SRV-1 is analogous to the U12 linker in PLRV, the latter of which lacks base pair and triplet interactions altogether. In line with the structural logic presented above, Olsthoorn et al. reported that loss of this third base-triplet interaction in SRV-1 (via mutation to a U\u00b7A base pair) decreased PRF by nearly a factor of 4 (11), again supporting Stem 1 stability as a determining factor in PRF efficiency, and suggesting that a lone, looped-out nucleotide linker, such as U12 in PLRV and U13 in BWYV (55), provides some structural advantage which offsets the potential loss from an additional base-triplet and can thereby facilitate more optimal ribosomal recognition.",

Previous studies used these structural features as evidence of frameshifting stimulation being favored by high-stability, rigid mRNA pseudoknots that would resist mechanical unfolding at the ribosome (9, 10) . This supposition was contradicted by the work of Brierley et al., who demonstrated a lack of correlation between -1 PRF and ribosomal pausing (56) , and more recently by the work of Woodside et al., which illustrated that -1 PRF is not dependent on resistance to mechanical unfolding (8) .",

Our observed conformational dynamics is well in line with this observation: our simulations provide structural evidence for multiple native states, partially-folded intermediates, and misfolded states that would be accessible upon refolding of the pseudoknot motif following mechanical unfolding at the ribosome, with transitions between these states readily occurring on submillisecond timescales. In addition, the stability of Stem 1, and of Stem 1-Loop 2 base-triplet interactions, has been shown to enhance PRF efficiency, which our model accounts for in terms of a resulting preference to maintain looped-out residues (U12 and A19) that can participate in ribosomal recognition. Our computational characterization of alternative native states and regions of high flexibility (Loop 1, Loop 2 and the U12 linker), alongside a conformational equilibrium involving numerous available macrostates, thus supports the conformational plasticitybased model of -1 PRF. Indeed, the apparent necessity for regions of high stability and rigidity alongside much more structurally-adaptable regions within the pseudoknot assembly, as a prerequisite for efficient PRF, provides a most intriguing 'micro-machine' view of the function of even this relatively miniscule viral RNA sequence.",

Three folding intermediates have been identified and characterized, as have multiple misfolded states.

Namely, from geometric and statistical considerations, we propose that stem folding order may be predicted by the relative sequence distances between adjacent strands that must find one another to form properly base-paired native stem regions (i.e. the stem-strand-sequence-separation).",
