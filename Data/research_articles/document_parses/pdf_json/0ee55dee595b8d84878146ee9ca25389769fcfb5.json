            "text": "Smartphone location-based methods have been proposed and implemented as an effective alternative to traditional labor intensive contact tracing methods. However, there are serious privacy and security concerns that may impede wide-spread adoption in many societies. Furthermore, these methods rely solely on proximity to patients, based on Bluetooth or GPS signal, ignoring lingering effects of virus, including COVID-19, present in the environment. This results in inaccurate risk assessment and incomplete contact tracing. A new system concept called PrivyTRAC preserves user privacy, increases security and improves accuracy of smartphone contact tracing. PrivyTRAC enhances users' and patients' privacy by letting users conduct self-evaluation based on the risk maps download to their smartphones. No user information is transmitted to external locations or devices, and no personally identifiable patient information is embedded in the risk maps as they are processed anonymized and aggregated confirmed patient locations. The risk maps consider both spatial proximity and temporal effects to improve the accuracy of the infection risk estimation. Experiments conducted in the paper illustrate improvement of PrivyTRAC over proximity-based methods in terms of true and false positives. An approach to further improve infection risk estimation by incorporating both positive and negative local test results from contacts of confirmed cases is also described.",

            "text": "As severe travel restrictions due to COVID-19 are being gradually relaxed in order to minimize further damage to the economy, it is expected that there will be continued cases of infection and pockets of community transmission until vaccines become widely available. To prevent sporadic cases from becoming sources of another outbreak, rigorous contact tracing is essential. Compared to the traditional approach of interviewing patients, the smartphone location-based approach has proven to be an effective alternative to accomplish comprehensive contact tracing with much less labor demands. However, there are serious privacy and security concerns associated with the smartphone-based methods that may impede adoption and wide-spread use in the many societies [1] . Effectiveness of the smartphone contact tracing approach can be significantly improved with active cooperation from the public by alleviating the security and privacy concerns. We propose a privacy-preserving, secure and accurate COVID-19 contact tracing systems called PrivyTRAC: Privacy and Security Preserving Contact Tracing System. PrivyTRAC 1. is a smartphone location-based contact tracing system with security and privacy inherent in the tracing mechanism that protects the privacy of both the patients and the public, and 2. infers from confirmed cases COVID-19 infection risk at given places and time that allows individuals to self-assess exposure risk from their movement histories.",

The risk maps consider not only the spatial proximity to COVID-19 patients, as in most contact tracing approaches, but also the temporal effect of how long the virus can stay virulent in the environment. We have learned that the novel coronavirus can remain contagious on surface for an extended period of time [2, 3] and virus-containing droplets can travel significant distances [4, 5] . The risk-based approach that considers not only instantaneous proximity to the patients but also the lagging effects after a patient has left thus offers a more accurate risk assessment of contracting the virus. Furthermore, as researchers continue to learn the factors that influence the virus spread, new findings can be quickly incorporated into our risk estimation model to refine the risk maps. ",

            "text": "Many smartphone location-based contact tracing approaches have been proposed or implemented recently [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] . They generally fall into two categories. One is to aggregate all smartphone movements of a population, whether a person is ill or not, in a centralized repository to identify encounters with the confirmed COVID-19 cases. The other category of methods is to use a phone's Bluetooth radio to record encounters of all other phones in proximity [3] and later alert the user when the unique cell phone ID of a confirmed case matches an ID in the user's phone. These two approaches suffer two main drawbacks -the first is privacy and security, and the second is accuracy. Their mechanisms require exposing individuals' locations and unique IDs, either in a centralized, externally maintained repository or to all other phones in vicinity. Privacy concerns may cause people to be less willing to adopt the tools, and hence render the tools less effective. Moreover, whether individuals' movement data and their encounters with other people are stored centrally or locally, there is always inherent risk that sophisticated and determined hackers can exploit software weaknesses to acquire personally identifiable information (PII) of individuals and their encounters, similar to the actions taken by some data brokers and aggregators for advertising purposes. In fact, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued warning of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to collect bulk personal information [4] .",

An ideal system would have true positive probably 1 at 0 false positive probability, i.e. the upper left corner in the plots. The 4 plots in Fig. 4 from left to right show the different choices in Eq. (1) for = 10, 50, 100, 150 seconds respectively. If the ability for the virus to infect diminishes quickly over time (e.g. = 10 sec), the difference between risk-based and proximity-based contact tracing is small Fig. 4(a) . On the other hand, as the decay time increases ( = 50, 100 sec), the risk-based approach performs significantly better than the proximity-based approach Fig. 4(b) (c). It becomes apparent in the cases where the virus' ability to infect diminishes slowly that the proximity-based approach cannot fully identify the infected people without incurring unacceptable false positives. The reason the risk-based and the proximity-based measures differ can be seen in Fig. 5 . In the figure, we plot the probability of contracting the disease on the x axis and, on the y axis, the 1 over the exponential of minimum distance from the infected person (i.e. \u2212 min distance ), for = 50 in Eq. (1). \u2212 min distance is chosen such that a higher number means a person is closer to the patient at some point in time and hence subjects to a higher probability of being infected. Each point on the scatter plot represents a case in the experiment. The marginal distributions (histograms) of the cases are also plotted on the top and on the right for the risk-based and the proximity-based measures respectively. If the proximity-and risk-based measures are similar, we would expect to see positive correlation on the plot. Even though most cases that are in proximity to the patient tend to have higher probabilities of infection, there are significant number of cases that are far enough from the patient spatially but are still subjected to high infection probabilities. It is mainly due to the delayed effect when the patient has left a location but the virus in the environment still has the ability to infect. ",

Since various environmental factors can impact how far virus-containing droplets can reach and how long the virus can remain contagious in air and on surface, the models can be extended to improve its accuracy by incorporating those factors if they are available. For example, the variances 2 and 2 in Eq. (1) can be replaced by a 2-dimensional covariance matrix to capture the effects of prevailing wind speed and direction on the spread of the droplets. The temporal variance 2 can be a function of the local temperature and humidity. In a confined environment, where infection by way of indirect contacts is possible, we can incorporate surface properties as part of the model. Another direction to refine the infection risk estimation is to consider reported cases of infection as observations. Consider the scenario where several people that came into contacts with a patient in a particular area have been tested for infection. Some of them were tested positive while others negative. The test results and their movement histories in the area are observations of the underlying risk model. The initial risk model is constructed mainly based on the knowledge of average reach and decay time of the virus. The new test results, positive or negative, provide additional information to adjust the model parameters so as to better align with local conditions. A Bayesian probabilistic model is well suited for this purpose: Based on the above Bayesian probabilistic model, we can refine the model parameters and by computing their posterior distributions:",

In the time span, a person enters the same area at random time, location and speed. The time was chosen with a uniform distribution between time 0 and 200 seconds; the location was chosen with a uniform distribution from the middle halves of the 4 sides enclosing the area; the speed remains constant as the person traverses the area and was chosen with a uniform distribution between 0.75 m/sec and 1.25 m/sec.
