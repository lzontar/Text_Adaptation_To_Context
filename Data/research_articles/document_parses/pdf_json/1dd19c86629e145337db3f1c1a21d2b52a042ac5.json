            "text": "Background: Flow cytometry is a powerful tool for the multiparameter analysis of leukocyte subsets on the single cell level. Recent advances have greatly increased the number of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in flow cytometry. In particular, an increase in available fluorochromes with distinct excitation and emission spectra combined with novel multicolor flow cytometers with several lasers have enhanced the generation of multidimensional expression data for leukocytes and other cell types. However, these advances have mainly benefited the analysis of human or mouse cell samples given the lack of reagents for most animal species. The flow cytometric analysis of important veterinary, agricultural, wildlife, and other animal species is still hampered by several technical limitations, even though animal species other than the mouse can serve as more accurate models of specific human physiology and diseases. Results: Here we present time-tested approaches that our laboratory regularly uses in the multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of ovine leukocytes. The discussed approaches will be applicable to the analysis of cells from most animal species and include direct modification of antibodies by covalent conjugation or Fc-directed labeling (Zenon\u2122 technology), labeled secondary antibodies and other second step reagents, labeled receptor ligands, and antibodies with species cross-reactivity. Conclusions: Using refined technical approaches, the number of parameters analyzed by flow cytometry per cell sample can be greatly increased, enabling multidimensional analysis of rare samples and giving critical insight into veterinary and other less commonly analyzed species. By maximizing information from each cell sample, multicolor flow cytometry can reduce the required number of animals used in a study.",

Flow cytometry employs fluorochrome-labeled antibodies that detect cell surface or intracellular antigens [6, 7] , a method that was first developed for characterization of cells and tissues by microscopy [8] . Recent advances in the development of novel fluorochromes and instrumentation (i.e. flow cytometry analyzers and sorters) allow for the theoretical analysis of up to 50 parameters in a single staining panel [9] , and a 28-color panel has recently been demonstrated [10] . Polychromatic experiments enable the simultaneous measurement of a larger number of cell surface and intracellular markers, thereby facilitating the analysis of infrequent cell subsets or limited cell samples [5, [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, many institutions have acquired high capacity flow cytometers, and the analysis of > 10 fluorochromes has become routine in the study of human and mouse cells.",

Unfortunately, we face many limitations in the analysis of non-mouse animal samples, including lower availability of commercially or otherwise available antibodies to cell antigens and reduced options for fluorochrome labels by commercial antibody suppliers. It is also not uncommon to receive limited amounts of hybridoma supernatant rather than purified antibody. In addition, antibodies for non-standard species tend to be more expensive.

Therefore, the technical specificities of the available instrumentation determine the fluorochromes in a staining panel. For the panels presented in this paper we used the BD LSR Fortessa\u2122 cell analyzer. Our machine has 5 lasers, UV (355 nm), violet (405 nm), blue (488 nm), yellow/green (561 nm), and red (640 nm), and can simultaneously detect up to 18 colors plus forward-(FSC) and side scatter (SSC) properties (Fig. 1 ). Figure 1 depicts the specific laser and filter set-up of our flow cytometer, its theoretically available colors, as well as examples for fluorochromes commonly used in our laboratory. As advised [37] , we aim to choose fluorochromes with minimal spectral overlap, and online resources such as the Spectrum Viewer from BD, Fluorescence Spectra Viewer from Thermo Fisher Scientific, or the BioLegend Spectra Analyzer help with assessing the degree of spectral overlap and potential spillover. The simultaneous use of fluorochromes with extensive spectral overlap is more feasible with appropriate compensation, carefully titrated antibodies, and when the antibodies recognize distinct cell populations, e.g. B cells vs. T cells; the approach is less suitable for co-expression studies [24, 38] . However, each specific staining panel will need to be tested and optimized on available instrumentation. More details on optimal fluorochrome combinations and discussions on appropriate compensation techniques are described elsewhere [12, 24, 37] .",

Companies such as BioLegend provide a relative brightness index for fluorochromes but also warn that the brightness can vary depending on the antibody, antigen, or cell type, and that it is also influenced by instrumentation. Consequently, titrating the antibody is always recommended. Examples of brighter fluorochromes that we used in our panels of this paper include phycoerythrin (PE), Alexa Fluor\u2122 (AF\u2122) 594, phycoerythrin-cyanine 7 (PE-Cy7), allophycocyanin (APC), and Brilliant Violet\u2122 421 (BV421) (Fig. 1) . In an ideal scenario, monoclonal antibodies for each cell antigen are available in all possible fluorochromes. However, even for human antigens this is not the case and is further from reality in veterinary species. Thus, initial antibody staining panel design will depend on easily available and previously validated antibodies (\"what is in the refrigerator\") and approaches to expand the panel.",

BioRad, for example, has a sound variety of anti-ovine and other veterinary antibodies, most of which are only available purified or conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or PE. A method to broaden the fluorochrome range is to label purified antibodies by using a reactive labeling kit that covalently binds fluorochromes to reactive protein groups, such as amines. In contrast to purified antibodies, non-purified antibodies (i.e. hybridoma supernatants, ascites fluid) cannot be labeled covalently without also labeling other protein components in the fluid, but they can be selectively labeled with the Zenon\u2122 labeling method (discussed below). Covalent labeling kits for variable amounts of antibody are available for numerous fluorochromes from commercial vendors, such as Invitrogen\u2122 by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Novus Biologicals, Abcam, or Biotium\u2122. The labeling procedure follows simple protocols provided by the manufacturer and takes less than 3 hours. The newly labeled antibody is immediately ready for staining but should be titrated and validated prior to use in an experiment. The reactive label works for all animal species and IgG subclasses, and the covalently labeled antibody is stable and can be stored for usage over several months. For example, we labeled purified anti-ovine CD8 with a Pacific Blue\u2122 antibody labeling kit and included it in a multicolor panel to detect CD8 + T cells among sheep blood lymphocytes (Fig. 2a) . Within the same staining panel, lymphocytes were additionally gated for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (Population A), CD4",

The Zenon\u2122 labeling technique uses fluorochrome-labeled Fab antibody fragments that recognize the IgG subclass (Fc portion) of its target antibody (Fig. 3 ). This noncovalent conjunction enables the labeling of human, mouse and rabbit antibodies, which can be purified antibodies, hybridoma culture supernatant, or ascites fluid [43] . Therefore, the Fab fragment of the Zenon\u2122 kit has to recognize the species (human, mouse or rabbit) and the IgG subclass (IgG 1 , IgG 2a or IgG 2b ) of the specific target antibody. To label the target antibody, it is mixed with the fluorochrome-labeled Fab fragments of the Zenon\u2122 kit, and the mixture is incubated for 5 min (Fig. 3a) . Next, the Zenon\u2122 blocking reagent is added to the mixture and incubated for another 5 min (Fig. 3b) . The Zenon\u2122 blocking reagent is a nonspecific immunoglobulin mix from the same species as the target antibody and will bind to excess fluorochrome-labeled Fab fragments (Fig. 3b) . Finally, together with other antibodies of the staining panel, the Zenon\u2122 mixture is added to the cell sample for staining (Fig. 3c) . After washing to remove unbound nonspecific immunoglobulins, the cells are ready to be analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3e) .",

While our laboratory sometimes stores the Zenon labeled antibody for 1-2 h in the refrigerator, the manufacturer's protocol allows for storage of up to several weeks with the addition of 2 mM sodium azide (Invitrogen\u2122). The use of the Zenon\u2122 labeling kits is quick and allows flexibility in staining because the fluorochrome can easily be changed by using the isotype-specific Zenon\u2122 kit in a different color. Multiple Zenon\u2122 labeled antibodies can be used simultaneously in the same staining panel, and isotype controls can be labeled in the same manner as the staining antibodies. Each new antibody-Zenon combination should be titrated to determine the best dilution.",

            "text": "For the flow cytometric analysis of cells from veterinary species fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies are widely used. Monoclonal and polyclonal secondary antibodies are produced in a diverse array of host species and are commercially available in a broad range of colors. The use of monoclonal secondary (and primary) antibodies is preferred as they usually achieve more consistent staining with less background. Secondary antibodies are employed to bind primary antibodies (which recognize antigens on target cells) without cross-recognition of target species antigens. Therefore, secondary antibodies recognize the species and isotype of the primary antibody and are adsorbed to or otherwise unreactive with antigens on cells of the target species. For example, a monoclonal mouse IgM antibody that recognizes sheep B cells (clone 2-104) [44] was visualized with a BV650-conjugated rat antimouse IgM monoclonal antibody ( Fig. 2a and d) . In the same staining panel, mouse anti-ovine CD62L clone DU1-29 was detected with a PE-Cy7-conjugated rat antimouse IgG 1 monoclonal antibody ( Fig. 2b and d) . Thus, use of secondary antibodies leads to signal amplification and is versatile, allowing for the selection of less commonly used fluorochromes and easy matching to a variety of panels.",

Even when using a single secondary antibody, the isotypes of all antibodies in the staining panel must be considered and the primary antibody that is targeted should be the only one recognized by the secondary antibody. However, including two additional staining steps allows for detection of an unlabeled primary antibody in the presence of additional (labeled) antibodies of the same isotype without crossrecognition by the secondary antibody. The first step includes only the primary antibody, followed by only the isotype-specific secondary antibody. After a requisite blocking step with excess unlabeled antibody of the isotype of the target antibody, additional antibodies of the same isotype can be used in a third staining step. Using this approach our laboratory visualized CD62L expressing cells (Fig. 2) as well as natural killer (NK) cells ( Fig. 4a and b) with anti-IgG1 secondary antibodies in the presence of other IgG1 staining antibodies. In Fig. 4 , unlabeled EC1.1, a monoclonal mouse IgG 1 that recognizes the ovine natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp46 [45] was visualized by rat anti-mouse IgG 1 , clone A85-1, conjugated to BUV395 (Fig. 4a and b) . Following the secondary labeling, the cells were blocked with nonspecific polyclonal mouse IgG to saturate any free valences of the secondary antibody, rendering it unable to interfere with the other mouse IgG 1 antibodies in the staining panel. Finally, mouse IgG 1 antibodies against \u03b14and \u03b21-integrins were employed in the staining procedure ( Fig. 4a and b) . Isotype control antibodies of the same species, antibody isotype and fluorescent label can be incorporated in the same manner as the staining antibodies (Fig. 4c) .",

            "text": "In this methods paper, we present several approaches to overcome flow cytometry limitations in the analysis of veterinary species. During our studies we faced several technical issues. For example, certain antibody clones were not sufficiently labeled by direct covalent labeling kits. This is an old problem and known causes of labeling resistance include: buffer components react with the dye, suboptimal pH, or reactive amine groups lie within the antigen-binding site of the antibody [46] . Zenon antibodies can be a solution for labeling monoclonal IgG antibodies that do not label well with labeling kits. For example, our ovine CD4 monoclonal antibody (44.38) did not yield satisfying staining quality when conjugated with the Invitrogen Pacific Blue antibody labeling kit. However, Fig. 4 Secondary antibody staining with multiple same-isotype primary antibodies and cell-surface molecule detection by ligand binding. (a) Summary of the steps to stain with an isotype-specific secondary antibody when its target isotype antibody is present multiple times in the same staining panel. (b) Staining of NKp46 with an isotype-specific secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG 1 ) in the presence of anti \u03b14and \u03b21-integrin antibodies, which are of the same isotype as the anti NKp46 antibody. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were pre-gated on single live lymphocytes as in Fig. 2a and CD3 + T cells and CD3 \u2212 NKp46 + NK cells analyzed for expression of \u03b14and \u03b21-integrins. (c) Corresponding isotype control staining for \u03b14and \u03b21-integrins. (d) E-selectin ligand expression on CD4 + T cells from afferent lymph of adult sheep was determined by flow cytometry using an E-selectin-human IgG fusion protein. Cells were pre-gated as in Fig. 2a . As a negative control, staining was performed in buffer containing EDTA. (b-d) One representative of five individually analyzed sheep is shown. Abbreviations: \u03b1m, anti-mouse; APC, allophycocyanin; BUV, Brilliant ultra violet; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, R-phycoerythrin using the Zenon technology yielded superior results. Another common difficulty is the conjugation of IgM antibodies because most labeling kits raise pH and denature the pentameric structure of IgM [47] . Some manufacturers, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific, offer specific protocols optimized for IgM labeling. In the case of the (mouse IgG1) anti-NKp46 clone, neither covalent conjugation nor Zenon\u2122 technology were effective methods for labeling, and we had to employ the staining method outlined in Fig. 4a . Unfortunately, not all commercial antibody suppliers have consistent quality controls in place and we have occasionally seen commercially labeled antibodies that are unreliable. We also found that in one case the Zenon\u2122 mix interfered with the staining of a different antibody in the same staining panel. Specifically, the antiovine B cell antibody (2-104) is a mouse IgM and its detection by an anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody was blunted. An ELISA revealed that the Zenon\u2122 blocking reagent that is included in the kits contained both mouse IgG and mouse IgM, and the latter was competing with our mouse IgM primary antibody for binding by the secondary anti-mouse IgM antibody. We solved the issue by using purified IgG for blocking rather than the Zenon\u2122 kit blocking component.",

We found that the following precautions prevent tandem conjugate degradation: staining at 4\u00b0C in the dark, careful and extensive washing after fixation (i.e. twice with sufficient buffer volume), and storage at 4\u00b0C in the dark for no longer than 24 h.

Sheep were 40-65 kg of weight when entering experiments Lymphadenectomy to remove the subiliac (prefemoral) lymph nodes was performed as previously described [52] . Six-eight weeks after lymphadenectomy, pseudoafferent lymph vessels were cannulated with heparin-primed 3 or 3.5 French polyurethane catheters (Access Technologies) in a surgical procedure as described [52] . Pre-procedural sedation was induced with Tilzolan (tiletamine and zolazepam; Dechra) at 4-6 mg/ kg into muscles of the hind or front leg; anesthesia was induced with propofol i.v. at 2-8 mg/kg (PropoFlo 28, Zoetis) and/or sevoflurane (Patterson Veterinary) per inhalation at 2-3% in oxygen via mask, and anesthesia was maintained at a surgical plane with 2-3% isoflurane (Isothesia, Covetrus) in oxygen, administered via an endotracheal tube. All surgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions in a dedicated surgical suite. Postoperative analgesia was provided using buprenorphine (Par Pharmaceuticals) at 0.01-0.05 mg/kg every 4-12 h s.c. in the neck, and/or flunixin meglumine (Flunixin Injection, Norbrook) at 1 mg/kg every 8-24 h i.m. in the leg. Additional doses of analgesics were given if animals showed signs of pain or distress, which were assessed at least three times per day for 3 days, and at least every 12-24 h thereafter for a week. Afferent lymph was collected into sterile bottles containing 100 \u03bcL of 10, 000 U/mL Heparin (Hospira, Inc.). Collection bottles were changed every 4-12 h. After conclusion of experiments, the animals were euthanized while under anesthesia by i.v. injection with pentobarbital and phenytoin (SomnaSol, Covetrus) at 97.5-195 mg/kg and 12.5-25/kg, respectively. Death was confirmed by auscultation for cardiac arrest. The method of euthanasia is consistent with the recommendations by the Panel of Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical Association.",

To block nonspecific binding, each tube of cells was resuspended, and subsequently incubated for 10 min, in 10 \u03bcl of staining buffer containing 1 \u03bcg sheep IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and/or 1 \u03bcg mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), as well as 0.1 \u03bcl of the LIVE/DEAD\u2122 Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitro-gen\u2122). The blocking step was performed at the beginning of the staining process or after staining with a secondary antibody before addition of antibodies of the same isotype as the primary antibody ( Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 a and b) . After blocking, antibodies to cell surface antigens were added and cells incubated for 15 min, and subsequently washed with staining buffer. Cells were then fixed by resuspending and incubating for 15 min in 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich), followed by washing with staining buffer. After fixation, ovine CD3 staining was performed in staining buffer containing 0.5% saponin (from Quillaja bark, molecular biology grade; Sigma Aldrich). Binding to a mouse E-selectin-human IgG 1 chimeric protein (R&D Systems) was tested in DPBS containing calcium and magnesium (Corning), and visualized by an APC-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG 1 antibody (clone 97,924; R&D Systems). The control was stained in the same manner using DPBS without calcium and magnesium under the addition of 30 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA; Invitrogen\u2122). Data was acquired using the BD LSR Fortessa\u2122 (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). A single cell gate was set for each cell sample using FSC-Area and FSC-Height as depicted in Fig. 2a . Dead cells were excluded from analysis by gating on LIVE/DEAD\u2122 Fixable Aqua low events, and lymphocyte and/or granulocyte gates were drawn based on SSC-Area and FSC-Area (Fig. 2a) . A minimum of 100,000 lymphocytes were recorded per tube. ",

Antibodies (Zenon-labeled or directly conjugated) to other cell surface molecules can be included in this step.
