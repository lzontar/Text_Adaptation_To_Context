            "text": "Th e ubiquity of antibiotics and vaccines in the First World has sapped contagious disease of much of its perceived phenomenological virulence. Carcinogenic fears and \"lifestyle\" diseases loom in the popular cultural imaginary. Th e average Western, middle-class subject, for instance-trained by media campaigns to be obsessively aware of all sorts of cancers-is likely much more concerned about annual mammogram protocols, to name just one example, than the rampant staphylococcal infections in the hospitals that house many mammogram machines. In contrast to biopolitical imperatives surrounding the hygienic containment of infectious disease of the nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century, neoliberal health states have created an environment in which lifestyle, risk mitigation, pre-treatment, and optimization become the predominant modes to self-fashioning. 2 Contagion, however, has certainly not gone away, even for Western states and in many ways has intruded upon these paradigms in the era of biomedicalization. 3 Nevertheless, the medical golden age of antibiotics became challenged with HIV in the 1980s and 1990s and, of course, most recently with zoonotic infl uenzas, the 2014 EVD outbreak, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And, perhaps ironically, the characterization of the autism \"epidemic\" by the \"anti-vaxx\" movement has ushered in the resurgence of highly infectious childhood diseases that had been controlled by vaccines for some time. It is no surprise, then, that infectious discourse paradoxically continues to intrinsically structure contemporary society even as much of industrialized society imaginatively constructs itself as beyond the pale of infection and serious contagious threats. Contagion is a \"cultural logic,\" to use Fredric Jameson's terms. If for Jameson, postmodernism was the cultural logic of a mode of capitalistic rationality, then contagion is a logic that serves dividing practices that subtend hermetic subjectivities, the distinction between self and other, and the supremacy and autonomy of the human. Often, this takes a biopolitical valence, based on what Foucault calls \"racism,\" (but which might more aptly be termed a hierarchy of life), where the human biological continuum is fragmented and categorized into those who are made to live at the expense of others who are allowed to die. On the one hand, Western cultures in many ways perceive that they have moved beyond contagious disease; on the other, they remain threatened by \"foreign\" and \"emerging\" diseases. Furthermore, they expand the biological notion of contagion as a way to understand threats to seemingly all aspects of life. In this capacity, contagion still threatens certain lives whether it be by way of suicidality, chronic diseases such as cancer or obesity, or physical and fi nancial productivity. In spite of First-World nationalism that imagines its subjects as immune to the threat of infectious disease, our post-postmodern, post-human, postnatural society nevertheless retains the structural paradigms of contagion and infection in discourses beyond biomedicine. We are strikingly not post-contagion.",

            "text": "Since the turn of the twenty-fi rst century, there have been a number of infl uential collections and monographs devoted to the subject, beyond medical histories of \"plagues and peoples.\" However, the prominent rubric by which cultural studies, science and technology studies (STS), and literary scholars have tended to approach the idea of contagion in their collections and monographs is through the epidemic. Th at is to say, it is framed as the form of contagion, whether pathogens or ideas, that emerges or, as it is frequently characterized, \"strikes,\" a population, disrupting the social and biological status quo. Th is is best characterized in Priscilla Wald's ( 2008 ) landmark Contagious , in which she chronicles \"the outbreak narrative,\" an emerging story of disease that \"dramatizes the most basic of human narratives: the necessity and danger of human contact\" (p. 2). Wald chronicles the plotting of epidemics from the case of Typhoid Mary to the Cold War era \"viral cultures\" to the turn-of-the-century Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic, contending that this narrative shapes the material conditions of epidemiology. Much of this kind of cultural studies work began earlier with Laura Otis' ( 1999 ) Membranes and then, notably, with Alison Bashford and Claire Hooker's ( 2001 ) collection Contagion , both of which focus largely on histories and on biological contagion. 6 Conversely, Peta Mitchell's ( 2014 ) \"metaphorological\" study presents a history of contagion as a metaphor. 7 Our volume unites these methodological aims in the pursuit of an innovative theoretical perspective and peers through the interstices of biological materiality and symbolic import. And, in contrast to the prevailing focus on contagion via epidemic patterns, this volume theorizes contagion as operant through an endemic prevalence in discourse and society. While epidemics and their narratives remain important for critical study, there has been little to no work done contextualizing the sheer prevalence of these narratives-a prevalence that constitutes by its very nature, as we argue in this volume, an endemic cultural perspective.",

In other words, epidemics are diseases that come from without to intrude upon 6 Much of this has come out of the interdisciplinary emerging from literary and cultural studies, evident not only in Wald and Otis' work but also in the special issues of American Literary History (2002) and Literature and Medicine (2003) : see American Literary History 14(4) and Literature and Medicine 22(1). 7 Just as Bashford and Hooker focus on biological contagion while keeping metaphorical contagion \"a central focus,\" so too does Mitchell suggest that the material and the fi gurative are intimately linked, though she focuses on the metaphor. 1 Making of a Modern Endemic a people.

            "text": "At the end of the eighteenth century, it was not epidemics that were the issue, but something else-what might broadly be called endemics, or in other words, the form, nature, extension, duration, and intensity of the illnesses prevalent in a population. Th ese were illnesses that were diffi cult to eradicate and that were not regarded as epidemics that caused more frequent deaths, but as permanent factors which\u2026sapped the population's strength, shortened the working week, wasted energy, and cost money\u2026In a word, illness as phenomena aff ecting a population. Death was no longer something that suddenly swooped down on life-as in an epidemic. Death was now something permanent, something that slips into life, perpetually gnaws at it, diminishes it and weakens it. (Foucault 2003 , p. 243) Today it is the lingering chronic illness, both fi gurative and metaphorical, that structures our cultural anxieties. Th e chronically ill citizen cannot contribute to a neoliberal society that prizes production, quotas, and stamina in the extreme social environment of the modern state that is increasingly devoid of social support for such \"productivity.\" Making live and letting die become a question of calculating and calibrating endemicity and its eff ects. Th e victim of an epidemic disease, that is, at least functions in their death to relieve society of an unproductive member. Th e endemically ill linger and metaphorically contribute in the social imaginary to the troubling endemic conditions of \"wasted energy\" and \"costs\" which neoliberal actors seek to track, mitigate, and eliminate both in and beyond traditional disciplinary structures of the school, the prison, and the workplace. 8 In the First World, this often translates to so-called \"diseases of civilization\" such as hypertension, obesity, and drug abuse; however, we also suggest that this is not only indicative of endemics such as \"diseases of civilization\" or microbial endemics such as TB in Africa but also indicative of how we perpetually tend to construct threats to governmentality as contagious, such as social-media-inspired suicide, fi nancial collapse caught from Asian markets, or, emergent exotic disease such as EVD-in short, how we construct an endemic of epidemics. We suggest that the discourse of endemicity stresses the particular dimensions surrounding the object described. It highlights how whatever is being described as \"endemic\" is characteristic of its context or milieu.",

As Marget Pelling has suggested, \"Contagion's capacity for excess has interested rather than frightened some in postmodernity, encouraging some to give up the dream [of hygienic containment]\" (Pelling 2001 , p. 2) . While many of the chapters that follow address contagion as virulence and threat, taken as a whole, Endemic resists the notion of contagion in its purely pathogenic connotations and invocation of the cordon sanitaire, following other critical and biopolitical theorizations of immunity such as those by Donna Haraway ( 1999 ) and more recently Roberto Esposito ( 2011 ) .

            "text": "We might be tempted to ascribe the seeming increase in the contagiousness of contagion discourse to the emergence of social networking and telecommunications advancements, such as mobile devices which facilitate the spread of so-called \"viral\" content, what Jussi Parikka ( 2007 ) has called the \"viral logic of networks.\" Certainly, since Wald's Contagious and Bashford and Hooker's Contagion , we have seen an exceedingly expansive set of social connections and forms of digital replication that deploy contagion into the technocultural realm. And yet, there exists a number of other conditions that have infl uenced the use and understanding of contagion in our contemporary moment, many biological in nature: such as antibiotic resistance, the 2014 EVD outbreak, studies in the microbiome, and zoonotic outbreaks; while other \"non-biological\" conditions such as the collapses of global markets, spread of fear pertaining to \"emerging diseases\" themselves, the increase and visibility of suicide, and the replicating, mimetic nature of school shootings have aff ected the facility to which we turn to contagion to explain threatening or socially destabilizing phenomena. However, as many of the authors in this collection suggest, the threat of contagion often reaffi rms extant socially constructed boundaries, or, as Wald has suggested, social and biopolitical bonds for shaping populations must be \"meaningfully reproduced\" (p. 58). Th e reaction and construction of contagion often does this work. Despite the increased understanding of social phenomena under the logic of contagion, the biological has not been supplanted by contagion's diff erent metaphoric iterations; our changing understanding of contagious disease continues to infl uence how we see other forms of propagating replication. Indeed, contagious contact necessarily represents the material realities of a physically connected world transcribed in their most extreme form (of potentially deadly connection or touch), where innumerable numbers of creatures and things are connected through the veritable tissues of air, atmosphere, and, indeed, seas of microbial organisms all connecting and comprising the spaces between us. However, as we have alluded to, this physical connectedness cannot but come with the burden of its own concomitant existential (and therefore spiritual, metaphysical, emotional, and symbolic) angst. Our volume seeks to represent this duality. To do anything otherwise risks building arguments on a set of misleading binaries. Th e point of this volume, therefore, is not to draw the lines between material and metaphorical contagion-a line which any thinking critic must acknowledge has been blurry since the formation of the concept itself. No physical contagious contact arises without epistemological (and therefore, at least partially psychological and symbolic) recourse to its human, animal, or environmental source, and no reference to metaphoric contagion can exist without a concept of literal contagious disease. 9 One is no more \"real\" than the other. Figurative contagion describes \"real\" infl uence and not only shapes our perception of reality but also has material eff ects. Said diff erently, contagion is about \"ideas becoming fl esh and fl esh becoming ideas\" (Pelling 2001 , p. 5) . Even the explicit and intended use of the term as metaphor rather than description of a biological entity or process is, as Martin Pernick observes, historically contingent. In Greek and Roman times, for instance, the infl uence of religion, ideas, and love was thought to infl uence physical health (Pernick 2002 ) . Moreover, the case has been made that such social and cultural infl uences have immunosuppressive eff ects (Blas and Sivasankara Kurup 2010 ) . Th ese perhaps seemingly discrete ontologies are, in fact, mutually constitutive, a foundational logic of the volume at hand, and we are fi rmly convinced that the possibilities which emerge from it urgently bear exploration.",

While some contributors focus on biological iterations and others on the social, cultural, or digital \"metaphors\" of contagion, rather than parsing phenomena in one category or the other, each of the authors in this volume considers the concept holistically, examining ways that the biological and the fi gurative borrow from each other to shape the various discursive topoi of biomedicine, political economy, media, epistemology, and other systems of thought.",

            "text": "While the understanding of contagion has been part of human history for centuries, its development as a \"living\" fi gurative concept has co-evolved with its understanding within biomedicine. Increasingly, the fi ndings of germ theory and bacteriology in the last decades of the nineteenth century reconfi gured society in the collective imaginary as enmeshed in a veritable atmosphere of microorganisms that science had by this time revealed to be dwelling in and around everyone and everything. While germ theory had been suggested with some frequency as early as the 1840s, its period of intense debate began mostly in the 1860s, when groups of scientists began to experiment in earnest with attempts to prove or disprove the concept. Nevertheless, the so-called advent of germ theory is in part a misnomer because it was hardly the fi rst moment during which contagious particles were theorized to cause disease. Individual scientifi c voices had proposed such methods of disease transmission even in ancient times. 10 However, germ theory did not emerge as a theoretical pole backed by the authority of a contingency of scientists until the mid-nineteenth century. Prior to the rising popularity of germ theory in the mid-century, miasma theory (which in this early 10 Th is is generally referred to as \"contagionism\" and was the prevailing model of disease transmission from the middle ages to the early nineteenth century. Its proponents emphasized the cordon sanitare (quarantine) in contrast to environmental eff orts to sanitize urban and impoverished areas-the method proposed by miasmists (sometimes referred to as anticontagionists). See Ackerknecht, E. H. (2009) period was considered less of a theory than a given) prevailed. Miasma theory held that poisonous or polluted air, particularly to be found in specifi c sorts of \"unhealthy\" places, caused disease. Th e nomenclature of the then-infamous malaria (which means \"bad air\") remains an artifact to miasma theory's predominance. By the 1880s, enough experimentation on the part of European scientists-most notably Koch, Pasteur, Semmelweis, and Lister-had proven to most other scientists as well as much of the lay public that germ theory was \"true.\" In this later period of germ theory's widespread acknowledgment as reality, the era of the \"microbe hunters\" (as Paul De Kruif 's 1926 eponymous book terms it) arose. Th e era might less sensationalistically be termed the Bacteriological Age, in which a new generation of young scientists, trained in the ostensible verity of germ theory, sought to identify the specifi c microbes associated with various diseases. As preoccupation with contagion from the late nineteenth century forward indicated, a general sense of interdependence and interconnectedness was therefore increasingly at the forefront of social consciousness (Tomes 1998 ) . As such, it is from the fi n de si\u00e8cle forward that we survey how contagion has shaped culture.",

Th is theoretical aim maps onto another that structures this section: the exploration of how other cultures threaten the contamination of one's own, a fear that, as Servitje's and Th ibault's essays demonstrate, often marches in lockstep with the fear that one's own culture may be insidiously infecting itself with values that threaten hegemonic norms. Lorenzo Servitje's essay begins this fi rst section with a discussion of Matthew Arnold, whose writings are synchronous with the early periods of germ theory's discussion and experimentation. His essay considers how Matthew Arnold's writings came to characterize \"modern\" (American and British middle-class) culture as a pathogenic and contagious form that threatened to dissolve social order at the turn of the nineteenth century. He argues that Arnold's anxieties of the \"Anglo-Saxon contagion\" drew both from germ theory and fi n-de-si\u00e8cle sociology to show how the beginning of cultural studies and liberal humanism was entangled with the discourse of contagion.",

Recognizing this connection and its costs, as well as acknowledging the value of our symbiotic relationship with many microorganisms, off ers us a way to rethink this socio-political order.

He theorizes contagion as a way to work through postmodernism's dissolution of universal truth and knowledge.

While many of the chapters show the positive potential in contagious and endemic discourse, Hooker, Deglin, and Mason incisively reveal how endemicity is, in most cases, representative of political and moral failurenot just in terms of aid response but also because the very rhetoric used to discuss disease states in various cultures precludes the prevention of such diseases altogether, and might almost be said to create them.",
