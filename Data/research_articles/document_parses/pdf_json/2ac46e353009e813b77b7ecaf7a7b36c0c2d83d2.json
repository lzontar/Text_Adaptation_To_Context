These proteins function to promote encapsidation of the RNA genome and virus particle assembly as well as playing potential roles in viral RNA synthesis. Nucleocapsid proteins can also associate with cellular proteins and signaling cascades. The arterivirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is no exception and localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus in virus-infected cells. This study generated an interactome map of the N protein from a highly virulent North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). This is a major pathogen of swine resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Crucial to the study was the use of SILAC coupled to affinity purification using GFP-traps and LC-MS/MS. This approach has not been applied before to the investigation of host/viral protein interactomes and this study revealed that the PRRSV N protein interacts with the host cell protein synthesis machinery especially at the level of translation initiation as well as with the RNA post-transcriptional modification machinery.

Emerging research suggests that live vaccines based on recombinant viruses with selected multiple attenuating mutations offer the best potential for future vaccine efforts. Due to the high losses in production resulting from PRRSV infection, the virus is of great economic importance. PRRSV belongs to the family of arteriviruses that are grouped together with the Corona-and Toroviruses into the order Nidovirales. During arterivirus (and coronavirus) infection, one of the most abundant viral proteins within the cell is the N protein that plays essential roles in the virus life cycle including encapsidation of the viral RNA [3] .

They indicated that N-EGFP interacted with protein components of the translation initiation complex (Fig. 2B ). The interaction of N protein with the selected cellular proteins was also assessed by disulfide reduction in the pull down reactions. N protein has been reported to multimerize, particularly into dimers [23] with one mechanism through the role of potential disulfide linkages [24, 25] . Therefore disruption of disulfide bridge formation would give an indication of whether binding to the cellular protein required multimeric N protein. No difference between the presence and absence of DTT was observed with any of the selected protein, apart from eIF4E, which appeared to bind less well to the N protein in the presence of DTT ( Fig. 2A) . Given the role of the N protein in cytoplasmic/ nuclear/nucleolar trafficking and previous studies showing the importance of some of these identified cellular proteins (that are found in the nucleus) in the related coronavirus biology (Table 1) , it is tempting to speculate that the N protein maybe recruiting nuclear proteins to facilitate virus biology. Knowledge of N/cellular protein interactions can also be used to generate live recombinant vaccines based on attenuating mutations. The use of reverse genetics in PRRSV [15, 26] and the introduction of attenuating mutations [27, 28] , including the N gene [10, 11] , is a clearly established strategy for investigating PRRSV Western blots were carried out on the bound fraction from cell lysates containing either EGFP or N-EGFP. Lysates were prepared, or with the addition or absence of DTT to a final concentration of 2 mM (+DTT). In the case of pull-downs carried out under reducing conditions (+DTT) also the dilution and wash buffer contained 2 mM DTT.
