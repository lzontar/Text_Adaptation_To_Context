            "text": "Some limited experimentation has suggested that aerosolized novel human coronavirus that is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can remain viable in the air for up to three hours [1] . Simulated studies have shown how health care workers can be at risk from patient secretions [2] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines that recommend the use of highest level of personal protective equipment when performing endotracheal intubation, which increases the risk of aerosolization [3] . A limited study has shown a possible benefit of a barrier box providing protection when performing endotracheal intubation [4] . A previously designed inexpensive and easily reproducible intubation protection device for the hospital setting was used [5] . This hospital model was adapted for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) use by modifying its size and making a more portable device that could be easily stored in the ambulance prior to use.",

Completed box dimensions for this device are 24 inches in height, 22 inches wide, and 27 inches in length. We reduced the width in this version from our hospital designed boxes in order to better accommodate the narrower EMS stretcher. For the top four corners, three-way fittings are used, and on the base corners two 90-degree fittings are used. On the posterior (caudal) surface, two \"T\" fittings are used which will support an additional cross-bar when assembled. Following construction of the frame's two sides, collision wrap is then used to cover each side. Collision wrap has a single adhesive side and is used in automotive industry to temporarily cover broken car windows. The adhesive side of the wrap faces into the interior of the box ( Figure 1 ). The frame cross-bars are not used in the preassembly period ( Figure 2 ).The time it takes to preassemble each EMS box is very quick and can be completed in under 30 minutes with two people working together. Cost of the EMS device remains low, and materials were purchased for less than 50 U.S. dollars. The largest expense was the automobile collision wrap, which can be used multiple times to rewrap the box.",

Prior to intubation, with two people working together, the box can easily be assembled. The three cross-bars are inserted in one side of the frame. The other side of the frame is then attached. Collision wrap can then be used to wrap the box in either a cephalad-to-caudal direction or opposite. Assembly takes approximately two minutes, and the box is now ready for use. During intubation, the box is laid over the patient covering the head and upper chest (Figure 4 ).",

Using a knife or any other sharp device, two vertical incisions can be made on the sides of the box to place hands through in order to use a bag valve mask. Additional incisions can be made on the cephalad wall for access to intubate the patient. Equipment can be passed through either the incisions or under the bottom of the plastic covering. The authors recommend the intubation being performed should be assisted by video laryngoscopy. This enables the prehospital clinician to not be required to be near the patient's oropharynx during the procedure. Following intubation, the box could be removed or even left in place for clinician protection during transport if a disconnection from the endotracheal tube occurred. If left in place for transport, bungee cords could be used to secure the box to the EMS stretcher.",
