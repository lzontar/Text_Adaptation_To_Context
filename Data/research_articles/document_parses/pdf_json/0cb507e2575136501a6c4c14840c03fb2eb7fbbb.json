He was intubated on day 5 of disease and started on lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon \u03b2-1b. His ICU stay was complicated by moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring persistently high ventilatory support, paralysis and repeated prone positioning. He also developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia requiring intravenous antibiotics. When ventilatory support was weaned to FiO 2 35% with PEEP 9, a tracheostomy was planned in view of the prolonged need for ventilation and pulmonary secretions clearance on day 39 of intubation.",

In our institution, full level 4 PPE is mandated for staff attending to confirmed COVID -19 cases. In addition, we wore the PAPR because a tracheostomy is an aerosolgenerating procedure (AGP). 5 (Supplementary Fig. 1) During transport from the ICU to OT, the patient was sedated with midazolam infusion 2 mg h -1 and paralysed with atracurium 30 mg i.v. When the patient was switched from the ICU transport ventilator to the anaesthesia machine in the OT, the TT was clamped with the forceps prior to disconnection. This maintained the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and minimised risk of aerosolisation from the disconnected TT. Potential contamination was also reduced by disconnecting the breathing circuit distal to the anti-viral HME filter. Intraoperative suctioning was performed through an inline suction catheter to avoid open suctioning which carries high aerosolising risks.",

This was useful because communication amongst staff was hampered with the use of the PAPR. Prior to the incision of the trachea, the surgeon clearly communicated to the anaesthetist who administered an additional dose of atracurium 20 mg. The patient was oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min. Ventilation was held once an incision was made in the trachea and resumed only after inserting and inflating the cuff of the tracheostomy tube. 6 Despite preoxygenation, the patient's oxygen saturation dropped transiently to ~ 80% during the procedure. It is important to recognize that these patients have poor reserves and the importance of ensuring a smooth tube exchange process by prior drills before an actual case. The surgery proceeded uneventfully, and the patient was transferred back to the ICU postoperatively.",
