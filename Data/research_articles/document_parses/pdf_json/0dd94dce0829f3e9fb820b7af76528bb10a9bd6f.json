Next, we note a peculiar feature of the relationship between WA1 and the WA outbreak clade. They differ by two substitutions, C17747T and A17858G, and despite hundreds of genomes sequenced in Washington State, no viruses with genomes identical to WA1 To investigate whether the observed pattern of evolution was consistent with the WA outbreak clade having descended from WA1, we simulated the entire WA outbreak clade, including the transmission history between thousands of cases, under realistic epidemiologic parameters (18) , and then evolved genomes forward in time under the constraint that they originated from WA1 (Fig. 2) . We simulated 1,000 epidemics seeded by WA1 on January 15 th 2020 with a median doubling time of 4.7 days (95% range: 4.2-5.1) and an evolutionary rate of 0.8x10 -3 substitutions/site/year. These simulated epidemics produced a median of 4,269 cases after 61 days (95% range: 1,993-11,053 cases). The median genetic distance from WA1 to the sub-sampled viruses was 3 mutations, which is consistent with the observed phylogeny. We examined the phylogenetic structure of maximum likelihood trees inferred from sub-sampled simulated viral sequences to determine how frequently they matched the observed relationship between WA1 and the WA outbreak clade. Specifically, a simulation tree matching the observed tree must produce a single branch emanating from WA1 that experiences at least two mutations (C17747T and A17858G in the observed tree) prior to establishment of a single outbreak clade (Fig. 3A ). Alternative patterns include: (i) a virus identical to WA1 (Fig. 3B) ; (ii) a virus that differs from WA1 by a single mutation (Fig. 3C) ; (iii) a viral lineage forming a basal polytomy with WA1 and the outbreak clade (Fig. 3D ); and (iv) a viral lineage that is sibling to the outbreak clade but only experienced a single mutation before divergence (Fig.  3E ). The frequency of alternative phylogenetic patterns in the simulated epidemics represents the probability that the true topology ( Fig. 3A) could not have occurred if the WA outbreak clade had been seeded by WA1. In 76.1% of simulations, we observed at least one virus genetically identical to WA1, with a median of 12 identical viruses in each simulation (95% range: 0-74 identical viruses). Not observing a virus identical to WA1 in the real Washington data does not significantly differ from expectation (p=0.239). However, viruses with one mutation from WA1 were observed in 97.0% of simulations, indicating a low probability of not detecting a single sequence from Washington within one mutation of WA1 (p=0.030). Lineages forming a basal polytomy with WA1 and the epidemic clade were observed in 99.1% of populations (p=0.009) and 100% of simulations had at least one sibling lineage diverging prior to the formation of the outbreak clade (p<0.001). Therefore, even if C17747T and A17858G were linked-a possibility since they are both non-synonymous mutations located in the nsp13 helicase gene-we would still expect to see descendants of their predecessors in Washington. In summary, when we seeded the Washington outbreak simulations with WA1 on January 15 th , 2020, we failed to observe a single simulated epidemic that has the characteristics of the real phylogeny (Fig. 3) . These findings are robust to simulations that used a a 12 to ity e ee k slower epidemic doubling time of 5.6 days (95% range 5.2-5.9) or an accelerated mutation rate of 1.6x10 -3 substitutions/site/year (18) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 67, "end": 70, "text": "(4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 71, "end": 74, "text": "17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 892, "end": 896, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3856, "end": 3860, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 252, "text": "Figure 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 991, "end": 999, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1900, "text": "(Fig. 3A", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1963, "end": 1972, "text": "(Fig. 3B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2031, "end": 2040, "text": "(Fig. 3C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2130, "text": "(Fig. 3D", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2254, "end": 2263, "text": "(Fig.  3E", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2397, "end": 2405, "text": "Fig. 3A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3642, "end": 3650, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State"}, {"text": "A subtree of the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree depicting the evolutionary relationships inferred between (i) the first identified SARS-CoV-2 case in the US (WA1); (ii) the clade associated with the Washington State outbreak (including WA2); and (iii) closely related viruses that were identified in multiple locations in Asia.

A standard approach to reduce geographical bias would be to down-sample data sets by removing genomes from more densely sampled locations. However, sequence data are sparse during the pre-pandemic stages of SARS-CoV-2 emergence and global spread, particularly from locations that experienced early outbreaks. In order to retain all available sequences, we opted instead to add unsampled taxa from underrepresented locations until achieving an arbitrary minimal ratio of 0.005 of taxa (sampled and unsampled) to cumulative number of cases in each location. To meet this threshold, 458 unsampled taxa were included from 13 locations that experienced early SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks but were poorly represented in the data available in GISAID.

To avoid an exceedingly high number of location transition parameters in a high dimensional CTMC, and to further inform the phylogenetic position of unsampled taxa, we utilized a generalized linear model (GLM) formulation of the discrete trait CTMC that parametrizes transition rates as a function of potential covariates (35) . We considered three covariates related to human mobility that potentially predict long-distance routes of early SARS-CoV-2 spread: (i) air travel [as previously used in (35) ], (ii) geographic distance (within continents), and (iii) an estimable asymmetry coefficient for Hubei, since in the early stage SARS-CoV-2 spread is dominated by an asymmetric flow out of Hubei, where the pandemic originated (36) . The effect size of each covariate was estimated, along with an inclusion probability. In our phylogeographic inference, we also included a Markov jump counting procedure in order to estimate the times of specific transitions between locations (19, 35) . The posterior distribution of the full probabilistic model using MCMC sampling was estimated after running chains sufficiently long to ensure adequate effective sample mutation from WA1 also did not significantly differ from expectation either (p=0.330).

In sum, the faster evolution scenario produced trees that experienced more evolutionary divergence than observed in real-data, we still find strong evidence against WA1 serving as the founder of WA outbreak clade, as all of the simulated epidemics experienced a divergent lineage prior to the formation of the outbreak clade.

We took 500 of the subsampled mutation-scaled trees from the original WA epidemic and sequence simulation and multiplied each branch length by 2 to simulate an accelerated mutation rate of 1.6x10 -3 substitutions/site/year. The same methods as earlier were used for the subsequent sequence evolution and tree inference.Italy Outbreak Epidemic Simulation. The same methods for epidemic and sequence simulation and tree inference were used to model the Italy outbreak. We used a contact network of 10,000 nodes and the infectiousness rate was 2.6-2.8 for the epidemic simulation within FAVITES: 500 applied an infectiousness rate of 2.6, and the other 500 applied an infectiousness rate of 2.8. We constrained our simulated epidemics to have a median doubling time of 3.4 days (95% range: 2.9-4.4 days), similar to prior epidemiological analysis (10) . The subsampling method remained the same. The Pyvolve simulations were restricted to 45 variant sites found in an alignment of length 29,775 with 28 taxa comprising Italian outbreak. The evolutionary rate of 0.8x10 -3 substitutions/site/year was translated to 0.529 substitutions/site/year across the 45 variant sites: (0.8x10 -3 x 29,775) / 45.

Acknowledgements of all laboratories that contributed SARS-CoV-2 sequence data used in our study are found in https://github.com/Worobeylab/SC2_outbreak. The genomes were aligned using MAFFT v.7 and partially trimmed at the 5' and 3' ends. Viruses with evidence of sequencing error were removed and only a single genome was retained from patients for which multiple genomes were available. For additional quality control, root-to-tip divergence was visualized as a function of sampling time using TempEst (31), based on a maximum likelihood (ML) tree inferred with IQTree (30). One potential outlier was identified and removed. Genomes sampled from cruise ship travelers were not considered. The final data set consisted of 364 genomes that were sampled from 28 countries. Chinese samples were available from 13 provinces, one municipality (Beijing), and one special administrative area (Hong Kong), which were considered as separate locations in our phylogeographic reconstructions. The exact date of virus collection was available for all sequences except for one genome from Anhui, China, and 17 from Shandong, China. For viruses for which only the month of viral collection was available, the lack of tip date precision was accommodated by sampling uniformly across a 30-day window (32) .Bayesian phylogeographic inference. The evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 was inferred using a Bayesian approach, implemented through the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework available in BEAST 1. 10.4 (33) , using the BEAGLE library v3 (34) to increase computational performance. We specify an HKY85 nucleotide substitution model using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) process, with a proportion of invariant sites and gamma-distributed rate variation among sites. An uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal distribution was used with an exponential growth coalescent tree prior. The relatively low sequence variability over the short time scale of viral dissemination introduces considerable uncertainty into phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2.
