Recently, a CPV-2 mutant was detected in Italy (Buonavoglia and others 2001) . The mutation occurred in residue 426 (Asp was replaced by Glu), so it was called mutant Glu-426 or CPV-2c. This mutation has also been detected in other countries such as Spain, Great Britain, Germany and Portugal (Decaro and others 2007a) .",

In some cases, enteritis can be more severe and associated with mortality (Evermann and others 2005) . There are two genotypes of CCoV, namely, CCoV type I (CCoV-I) and type II (CCoV-II). These two genotypes are now regarded as members of the species Geselavirus within the genus Alphacoronavirus, together with swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline coronavirus type I (FCoV-I) and type II (FCoV-II) (de Groot and others 2008). CCoV infection is usually restricted to the enteric tract, although, in Italy, CCoV was recently associated with a systemic fatal disease in pups (Buonavoglia and others 2006) . Severe clinical signs were observed in the affected pups, and necropsy examination revealed remarkable gross lesions in lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys. CCoV type II RNA was detected at very high titres in the internal organs of these dead pups. The association of CCoV with a severe, sometimes fatal disease in dogs, together with the isolation of the virus from internal organs with severe lesions, strongly suggests that CCoV tropism has evolved to acquire the ability to spread from the intestinal tract to other organs (Decaro and others 2007b) .",

We report on outbreaks of pantropic CCoV in France and Belgium, including the first case of a lethal infection with pantropic CCoV in a European country other than Italy, thus extending the area of distribution of this lethal viral infection.

Lymphoid tissues were oedematous and lymphoid depletion was evident in some nodes, while lymphoid hyperplasia was not observed. Mild to severe hepatocyte degenerative changes were observed; cytoplasm was clear, showed microvacuoles and was negative to Periodic Acid Schiff staining (confirming hepatocellular microvesicular steatosis) (Fig 2) .

This pup had non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea and survived, unlike the other co-infected puppies. High genomic levels of CPV-2c were convulsions. The attending veterinarian of the cases suspected parvovirus infection. Despite supportive treatment (fluid therapy and \u03c9 interferon 2 million IU/kg), the puppies died within 3 days. Eight (three from the first outbreak and five from the second one) of the dead puppies were frozen and submitted to the authors institution for further investigation. In addition, faecal samples were taken for analysis from two diarrhoeic animals (dogs ULg 100 and ULg 103) from another litter at the breeder after the second outbreak. Outbreaks 3 and 4 occurred in a pet shop in P\u00e9ruwelz, Belgium, in September and November 2008 (in total seven puppies died); these were the first cases in Belgium. Outbreak 5 occurred in Oudenburg, Belgium, in August 2009 (two puppies died). In each of these last three outbreaks, one puppy was submitted for necropsy and virological investigation. Clinical signs were the same in all animals but one showed nonhaemorrhagic enteritis and survived. Necropsies were performed and organs (intestine, spleen, liver, lung and brain) were removed separately, crushed and analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, histopathologic evaluation was performed.",

It is also the second report anywhere of a lethal pansystemic disease in dogs caused by CCoV-II infection alone. The clinical signs and organ pathology were similar to those observed previously during the Italian outbreak with the CCoV-II pantropic variant (Buonavoglia and others 2006) . In most of the reported cases, the veterinarian suspected a CPV-2 infection. Although seizures can be present with CPV-2 infections alone, they were also systematically observed in association with the pantropic CCoV infections both during dual infection with CPV-2 and mono CCoV infections.",

Currently, there are no reports on the association of this CCoV genotype with systemic infections. Sequence analyses and experimental infections with CCoV-I strains would be needed to further characterise this virus as a pantropic strain. In addition, it could be suggested that a concurrent CPV-2 infection might facilitate the spread of enteric CCoV to non-target tissues others 2009, Ntafis and others 2011) . This outbreak involving CCoV-I followed a previous one that occurred in the same breeding facility 3 months earlier and was associated with CCoV-II infection. These two outbreaks were most likely the consequence of two independent events of viral introduction to the breeding facility, probably attributable to the breeder's participation in several dog shows.",
