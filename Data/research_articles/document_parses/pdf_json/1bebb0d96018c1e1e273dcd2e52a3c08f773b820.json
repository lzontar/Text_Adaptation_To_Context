            "text": "High fidelity Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) can be tackled by means of non-linear Finite Element Models (FEM) suitable to capture large deflections of structural parts interacting with fluids and by means of detailed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). High fidelity is gained thanks to the spatial resolution of the computational grids and a key enabler to have a proper exchange of information between the structural solver and the fluid one is the management of the interfaces. A class of applications consists in problems where the complex movement of the walls is known in advance or can be computed by FEM and has to be transferred to the CFD solver. The aforementioned approach, known also as one-way FSI, requires effective methods for the time marching adaption of the computation grid of the CFD model. A versatile and well established approach consists in a continuum update of the mesh that is regenerated so to fit the evolution of the moving walls. In this study, an innovative method based on Radial Basis Functions (RBF) mesh morphing is proposed, allowing to keep the same mesh topology suitable for a continuum update of the shape. A set of key configurations are exactly guaranteed whilst time interpolation is adopted between frames. The new framework is detailed and then demonstrated, adopting as a reference the established approach based on remeshing, for the study of a Polymeric-Prosthetic Heart Valve (P-PHV).",

            "text": "In all the engineering areas of development, multiphysics analysis appears highly difficult to be carried out because of the interactions between more than one physics involved. During the achievement and the analysis of coupled systems, the way in which the shape of the object influences its performances is required to be carefully taken into account. In the biomedical engineering field for example, the design and the evaluation of the behaviour of prosthetic valves, stent-grafts and ventricular assist devices are related to both the structural and fluid mechanics physics [1] [2] [3] . Generally speaking, numerical meshes need to be created for the specific kind of analysis and, in a multi-physics context, two or more meshes have to be realised. In this environment, each geometric change is applied to all the numerical models involved in the analysis: such update has to be performed in a rapid way and as easy as possible. This task, usually carried out through remeshing methods, may be also obtained faster with the use of mesh morphing techniques. This approach allows the changing of the shape of a meshed surface so that the topology is preserved while nodal positions are updated [4, 5] : modifications are applied on a baseline grid by moving the surface nodes and propagating displacements inside the surrounding volume mesh nodes. Concerning biomedical applications, morphing methods have been applied in both bone and cardiovascular fields. Recently, in [6] , an interactive sculpting and RBF mesh morphing approach has been proposed to address geometry modifications using a force-feedback device, while in [7] RBF have been applied to improve cranioplasty applications. In the cardiovascular field, morphing approaches were employed in [8] for the registration procedures of the cardiac muscle and to model an aorta aneurysm carrying a one-way FSI [9] [10] [11] . In literature RBF have been extensively employed to tackle FSI problems [12] , using the modal method for both static [13, 14] and transient simulations [15] [16] [17] , as well as the two-way approach [18, 19] with RBF-based mapping methods [20] . In this work the state of the art regarding biomedical one-way FSI applications, as shown in [11] , is furtherly improved for a transient simulation by taking into account the non-linear deformations of the wetted surfaces during motion. An ad-hoc workflow was developed to transfer and to update, using an RBF-based morphing technique, the CFD mesh, incrementally adjusting the geometry according to the non-linear evolution predicted by the FEM solver. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it was applied to a tailor-made Polymeric-Prosthetic Heart Valve; these devices [21] proved to significantly reduce blood coagulation problems, maintaining excellent properties in term of strength, efficient function and long-term durability [22, 23] . This work is arranged as follows: at first, an introduction on FSI coupling is given, comparing remeshing and morphing workflows. The proposed procedure is implemented in the following paragraph, in which the incremental approach is shown on the P-PHV case. Results are finally discussed and compared to those obtained by remeshing.",

            "text": "One of the most delicate processes in a Fluid-Structure Interaction analysis concerns the management of the fluid-solid interfaces; at the boundary surfaces between these two domains, solution data is shared between the fluid solver and the structural one. A useful and employed kind of FSI analysis concerns all the simulations in which a moving body interacts with an internal or external surrounding fluid in a unidirectional way. This one-way coupling does not guarantee energy conservation at the fluid-solid interface but holds the benefit of lower computational time in comparison to the bidirectional one, in which a continuous data exchange between Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM) and CFD solvers is required. In this work two Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) methods [24] [25] [26] for moving meshes are employed: the first based on remeshing algorithms, called in this paper \"standard\" approach and the novel one using RBF mesh morphing procedures. In this first kind of analysis, as shown in Fig. 1 , a specific component is responsible to transfer the deformation of the CSM mesh to the grid of the CFD solver. In fact, one of the most applied strategies to manage body meshes in FSI applications is simply to move the grid for as long as possible and, when the quality of the mesh becomes critical, to enable the remeshing tools updating the lowquality cells generated by high displacements in the fluid domain [27] . Larger are the displacements of the grid, wider are the distortions of the cells; remeshing method agglomerates cells that violate the initially defined Skewness [28] or size criteria and remeshes them. If the new cells or faces satisfy the Skewness criterion, the mesh is locally updated with the new cells, interpolating the solution from the old cells. Otherwise, the new cells are discarded and another remeshing step is required. Obviously, when small displacements are involved and just few remeshing steps are necessary, this approach may be considered efficient. However, for larger displacements, the number of remeshing steps increases to avoid the presence of negative and invalid elements; as a result, the simulation is slowed down because a new mesh with different numbers and positions of nodes and cells has to be generated more frequently.",

It is possible to observe how in this 3D-representation the local maximum values are placed in the same zones. Maximum local fluid velocities are reached right at t = 7 ms because the fast movement of the leaflets pushes away the blood: maximum value for the FSI implemented with the novel approach is 3.011 m/s, about 5.58% less than the value detected in the analysis based on remeshing, that is 3.189 m/s. Computational Time -The time required to calculate the solution is the most interesting difference between these two solution methods: with the same number of elements and to parity of time step (1e-5 s), the standard workflow requires 6283 min to solve the problem while the CFD analysis with the morphing application only 396 min, approximately 16 times faster. Furthermore, if time step is increased, Fluent solver using remeshing starts having troubles and the obvious consequence is the no-convergence of the model. This phenomenon does not happen with morphing by which time step can be highly increased without problems and solution time can be reduced up to 60 times compared to that of remeshing.",

In particular, this powerful system has proved to be useful and accurate in all those applications in which the movement of the fluid domain is strongly controlled by the deformation of the solid domain. The possibility to replicate the non-linear analysis in which the motion of a solid model is transferred to a fluid domain carefully handling the interfaces is demonstrated. In a specific application case, the attempt to transfer aortic valve opening kinematics to the CFD analysis through a mesh morphing technique results to be successful and the effectiveness of the FSI simulation implemented through mesh morphing to reproduce the fluid dynamic field of the aortic valve is here shown and validated. Morphing has turned out to be very consistent in comparison to remeshing. Further research is needed to asses in more detail the differences between these two distinct approaches. Testing the novel workflow on a FSI analysis about the study of the opening of a polymeric aortic valve, it has allowed to reduce the simulation time up to 16 times in comparison to that required by remeshing methods using the same time step. Until now, numerical FSI simulations have been used in a restricted manner precisely because of the long time required to solve them, as in the case of heart valve computational analyses. Dealing with clinical trials, this approach could ensure a considerable time saving with a decrease of the final mesh quality which results acceptable for the numerical solver here adopted. This new workflow has definitely broken down this limit, granting in this case the possibility to test several models of P-PHV in a lot of flow conditions. In addition, a parametric design of P-PHV combined with this method could finally make a strong contribution to the patient-specific aortic valve replacement.",

In this way, the surface nodes of the FE model are used as Sp to apply RBF mesh morphing in the space. The detailed workflow shown in Fig. 2, in addition to the realization of the geometric model, provides for three main steps: -CSM settings -RBF Morph application -CFD set-up CSM Settings. Given that in this kind of FSI analysis the deformations of the fluid grid are imposed by the motion of the walls of the CSM domain, a structural simulation has to be conducted to obtain the deformed positions in the space during time. During the structural simulation, Source points (S p ) and Target points (T p ), that are the surface nodal positions of the grid in this case, are recursively extracted and stored in files. These files are structured as a list of nodes and the related displacements to obtain the nodes in the following sampled configuration.",
