The use of LUS on pregnant women is an emerging trend, considering its effectiveness during the outbreak. Eight pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by nasal/throat real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing who underwent point-of-care LUS examinations after routine obstetric ultrasound are described. A routinely performed LUS examination revealed serious lung involvement in 7 cases: 2 were initially asymptomatic; 3 have chest computed tomography; 1 had initial negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results; and 1 had initial negative computed tomographic findings. Treatment for COVID-19 was either commenced or changed in 87.5% of the patients (n = 7 of 8) on LUS findings. Among patients with abnormal LUS findings, treatment was commenced in 5 patients (71.5%) and changed in 2 patients (28.5%). One normal and 7 abnormal LUS cases indicate the impact of routine LUS on the clinical outcome and treatment of pregnant women.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] It has been reported that LUS can be a substitute for chest radiography by being practical, reliable, cost-effective, and safe. 8 It may also reduce the need for chest radiography and detect pathologic lesions before hypoxia occurs. 7 Furthermore, these advantages can particularly be more important for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women. 9 Recently, it was proposed that LUS should be embraced by obstetricians and gynecologists during the current COVID-19",

Pregnant women who underwent LUS examinations after obstetric US examinations were included. All diagnoses were confirmed by nasal/throat real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing. All LUS examination were performed by the first author, with 20 years of experience before the study. The recently standardized 14-area scanning protocol for the use of LUS on patients with COVID-19 was applied. 12 This protocol has also been proposed to be used in pregnant women. 10, 12 Fourteen areas (3 posterior, 2 lateral, and 2 anterior) were scanned per patient for 10 seconds along the indicated lines. Where applicable, scanning from the intercostal space was preferred. Each area was given a score between 0 and 3 according to the specific pattern. 12 The pattern with a continuous and regular pleural line and horizontal artifacts, referred to as A-lines, was classified as score 0. The pattern with an indented pleural line and sporadic vertical white areas below the point of discontinuity in the pleural line, referred to as sporadic B-lines, was classified as score 1. The pattern with a broken pleura, small consolidated areas below the discontinuity, and multiple vertical white areas that reached the bottom of the field of view, referred to as multiple B-lines, was classified as score 2. The pattern with a severely broken pleura and a dense and largely extended white lung pattern with or without larger consolidations was classified as score 3. At the end of the procedure, the highest score obtained for each area was noted (eg, landmark 1, score 0; landmark 2, score 1; and so on).",

A CT scan was planned but was refused by the patient. Her hemogram and biochemical results were unremarkable. A LUS examination was performed, and physiologic A-lines were observed. The patient was relieved after normal LUS findings (Figure 1 , A and B, and Video 1). Antenatal CT was deemed unnecessary. She underwent elective cesarean delivery for prolonged prelabor rupture of membranes and gave birth to a clinically well 3070-g male neonate with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The nasopharyngeal and throat swab of the neonate yielded negative results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The normal LUS findings were affirmed by normal postoperative CT findings ( Figure 1C ). The patient was discharged early after her normal LUS and CT findings and was in stable condition.",

To the best of our knowledge, this article provides the largest case series so far regarding the use of LUS on pregnant women. Chest CT is now considered an essential tool for the diagnosis and management of the SARS-CoV-2. 2, 11 Although a single chest radiograph causes radiation exposure as low as about 0.1 mSv, it has been found to be insensitive in mild, early, and late phases of COVID-19 infection. 16, 17 Several centers have a low threshold for the use of low-dose CT as a screening test for COVID-19, and some screen all patients who have been admitted to the hospital. 16 However, a recent consensus statement from the multinational Fleischner Society emphasized that the use of CT should be assessed in detail, considering the severity of the disease, pretest probability, risk factors of the individual for clinical progression, and local resource limitations. 17 The society did not recommend the use of CT or chest radiography as a screening test in asymptomatic patients and mild symptomatic patients without progression. In addition, in limited-resource settings, chest radiography has been proposed to be preferred in lieu of CT for patients with mild symptoms.",

Treatment should be considered in cases with risk factors or severe clinical progress. 15 However, those recommendations may not be relevant for a specific vulnerable population: pregnant women. Although exposure to a low level of ionizing radiation by chest imaging during pregnancy is considered relatively safe, this can be a major source of anxiety for many pregnant women and their health care providers. 21 Pregnant women are also regarded as a high-risk group along with people who are immunocompromised, with underlying end-organ dysfunction, who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility, and who are 65 years and older. 17, 18 In this series, 3 women who refused chest imaging because of the potential risks to the fetus and breast were admitted with mild symptoms. Those women accepted the implementation of routine LUS for test-positive pregnant women; therefore, their medical management was changed after their lung involvement was identified as a risk factor.",

Recently, the CLUE (COVID-19 lung ultrasound in emergency) protocol was suggested to be used in emergency medicine settings for stratifying patients suspected of having COVID-19 based on both the LUS findings and the supplemental oxygen requirement. 25 However, that protocol was based on scanning of the chest for 12 anatomic landmarks instead of 14, as used in our study. We had 2 mild cases, 5 moderate cases, and 1 critical case. Considering the LUS findings and the clinical severity of our cases, we can suggest that pregnant women with LUS scores of less than 8 can be regarded as mild, between 8 and 15 as moderate, between 16 and 24 as severe, and greater than 24 as critical.
