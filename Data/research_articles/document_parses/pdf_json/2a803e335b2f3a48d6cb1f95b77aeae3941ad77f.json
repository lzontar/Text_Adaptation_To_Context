As with previous novel infection outbreaks, antiretrovirals are just one drug class that has been held up as a potential strategy for prophylaxis and treatment with scant evidence and risk of harm. Here we summarise the evidence for antiretrovirals to treat COVID-19 and, as a drug that has also been studied in HIV, hydroxychloroquine, and flag some of the pitfalls of using therapies that have not been evaluated robustly.",

Numerically more individuals in the LPV/r arm experienced clinical deterioration and the authors concluded that neitherLPV/r nor umifenovir monotherapy provided clinical benefit over supportive care for hospitalised patients with mild/moderate COVID- 19 . A larger open-label RCT in 199 people hospitalised with severe COVID-19 demonstrated no benefit of LPV/r over standard of care [11] in terms of clinical improvement or viral clearance. However, a trend to better outcomes when LPV/r was started early (within 12 days of symptoms onset) was considered worthy of further study and there are many trials investigating LPV/r recruiting now or imminently. Of note, antivirals including LPV/r may offer more benefit when used in early [11] or less severe COVID-19 and immunomodulatory therapies, which we will not cover here, may be a better option for critically ill, hospitalized patients. Indeed, the lesson from the early reports and trials that have (understandably) focused on critically ill individuals may not necessarily be transferable to mild or moderate disease, nor to prevention strategies, and we will learn more about the best place for therapies over time.",

The antiretroviral effect of LPV/r is through its inhibition of HIV's aspartase protease enzyme and activity against SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through inhibition of its cysteine protease. However, the concentration of LPV/r required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is 4,000-8,000-fold higher that that required to inhibit HIV [13] so it perhaps entirely unsurprising that the dose effective to treat HIV may be ineffective for COVID-19. The penetration of drug into target sites is also crucial; the protein-adjusted IC90 values of lopinavir required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in plasma, pulmonary epithelial lining fluid and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively, 200-fold, 20-fold and 2000-fold higher than the concentrations measured in vivo in COVID-19 patients [13] arguably the results of the LPV/r COVID-19 trials so far were predictable. LPV/r dose will be limited by toxicity and the higher concentrations of LPV described in COVID-19, compared to those observed in people on LPV/r for ART, are already significantly higher, likely due to the impact of coronavirus on liver function [14] .",

            "text": "Although chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are not antiretrovirals, they too were mooted as potential treatments for HIV, thanks to their immunomodulatory actions, with 'promising' pilot results [25] but no benefit (indeed a degree of harm) in the only randomised trial of sufficient duration [26] .The mechanism of any specific antiviral action of HCQ is unclear, but it is known to decrease endosome acidity, which might prevent release of virus into the cytoplasm [27] .HCQ has also been trialed for other viral diseases after favourable in vitro results, but never shown to be efficacious, and even deleterious in the case ofChikungunya [28] . Unfortunately, a small,poorly designed study with non-clinical end-points [29] , and media hysteria have led to HCQ, and azithromycin (the drug it was partnered with) to be the top two treatments used for COVID-19 in the 'COVID019 real time barometer' study of over 20,000 physicians in 30 countries, with 55% reporting HCQ use at the time of writing [30] . That HCQ and azithromycin were rapidly incorporated into some COVID-19 treatment guidelines [31] would be brave enough if this drug combination were harmless, but concerns of cardiovascular toxicity, including an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in a preprint study [32] , prompted the early termination of CQ + azithromycin trial in Brazil [33] , and led the FDA to warn about conduction abnormalities associated with HCQ or CQ and advise that clinicians should prioritise clinical trials if considering the use of these agents to treat COVID- 19 [34] .Since then, a retrospective analysis of cardiovascular events associated with HCQ and azithromycin in the World Health OrganizationPharmacovigilance Database, undertaken prior to their use for COVID-19, described a significant association with prolonged QT interval and ventricular tachyarrythmia for each drug that was even greater when both were given in combination [35] .",
