What we need to deliberate is, through what kinds of decision-making model and scientific ideology are risk perception and social trust formed? From a systematic perspective, as Taylor (1999, p. 163) indicated, risk communication is not only a matter of assessment and resolution of data it is also a fundamental part of the structure of risk culture. In other words, risk communication in decision-making relates to scientific and regulatory cultures in different social contexts. These factors influence the risk assessment of policy decision-makers and how they communicate risk information to the external society. Moreover, from the perspective of 'risk society' (Beck 1993) , it is crucial to deliberate how technocrats' risk assessment and value-judgment influence decision-making and deepen social (dis)trust. 5 The aforementioned traditional positivist risk assessment and related policy making are becoming increasingly insufficient, leading to many advanced industrial countries gradually paying increasing attention to public risk perception, communication, and involvement, with the hope of restoring public trust in the capability of governments to govern. However, a vital issue to consider is what such a democratic model of risk related policy making would look like if it was to emerge in the once autocratic governmental system of the newly emerging industrial countries; in other words, does there exist an innate conflict between this new and developing, democratic risk governance paradigm and this regions policy making model?; are the remnants of this regions authoritative system's power still influencing technocrats, creating a tendency towards emphasizing scientific authoritarian expert politics carrying out policy making?

Thus, while facing serious technological uncertainty and risk disputes, this authoritarian regime has firmly maintained a mainstream decision-making model of sound science, while totally ignoring the importance of risk communication. Chou (2002 Chou ( , 2004 Chou ( , 2006 Chou ( , 2007a Chou ( , 2007b Chou ( , 2008 points out that in relation to a number of risk related disputes including GMO, the Taiwan Biobank, Taiwan Biomedicine Island, potential BSE risk in US imported beef and dioxin polluted food, Taiwan's technocrats have maintained an equal degree of authoritarian politics, revealing a scientific authoritarian attitude in their handling of various different social disputes, while showing an obvious disdain for public doubts and perceptions. Even in the face of strong criticism and pressure from society, they continue to emphasize that the most important aspect of policy making and assessment is to work in accordance to positivist scientific evidence. This deep seated authoritarian scientific ideology has created a culture of concealment during public risk disputes; putting off communicating vital information; neglecting the need for public risk communication because the government perceives unbalanced one-sided related information to be sufficient in communicating with the public. 7 As a result of this inlaying of a new culture on the 5 And, to consider from a broader perspective the political and decision-making system, it is worthy to overview what kinds of political and decision-making contexts do risk governance and public trust disputes form. 6 As for the distinct structure and culture which has emerged from the newly industrialized nations method of risk governance, relatively speaking the related research materials are limited, on the one hand because only a small amount of research on the topic of high tech risk disputes have focussed on the newly industrialized countries; on the other hand attempting to reveal the distinct nature of risk governance in this area is like trying to begin. Therefore, this paper will only focus on Taiwan case studies. 7 In a number of technological and food related risk case studies, there has emerged a number of interesting related governance structural problems, For example in the disputes over the 2005 BSE outbreak, dioxin remnants of an authoritarian system whose historical context still exist; the developments of the past years have created an hidden and sluggish regulatory culture while forming distinct governance structural problems in the fabric of local society. 8 This type of risk governance structure in the long term erodes public trust. The results from past surveys of public risk perception show that the level of trust that the Taiwanese public have in their government's risk governance capability is relatively low. 9 A result which bears witness to Slovic (2000a) statement, 'system destroys trust' (Slovic 2000a) ; that is to say, this type of authoritarian style regulatory culture has created a social environment where hiding and holding back information is a norm, where the public when faced with a risk dispute are unequipped to find real answers through the official channels of the system; creating a high level of distrust towards the system itself.

Regarding public awareness of food safety regulations (TW/ EU20), 47.1% (Taiwan), 61% (EU), 59% (UK), and 56% (Germany) of the respondents said they were aware of food safety regulations, while, 48.7% (Taiwan), 39% (EU), 41% (UK), and 44% (Germany) responded that they were unaware. Also, 37.9% (Taiwan), 66% (EU), 63% (UK), and 61% (Germany) of the respondents said they had heard of regulations on consumers' rights while 55.8% (Taiwan), 34% (EU), 37% (UK), and 39% (Germany) said they had not (TW/EU21). Moreover, 77.2% (Taiwan), 85% (EU), 83% (UK), and 86% (Germany) of the respondents said they were aware of health warnings on cigarette packs (TW/EU22). Questions TW/EU20 and 21 showed that Taiwanese citizens are not familiar with related regulations on food safety and consumers' rights, which is evidence that the government has not performed as well as other countries. However, for acknowledgment of health warnings on cigarette packs (TW/EU22), Taiwanese people showed a significantly higher level of awareness (although still lower than the EU, UK and Germany). This was because since the 1980s, the John Tung Foundation has been promoting a 'No Smoking' movement in the public eye, and attracted great public attention. In this case, civil society played an important role. Section V was designed to probe into public attitudes towards government's risk governance capacity. It contained 8 questions (TW3, 5; TW/EU23-25; TW/EU30-32). Table 5 shows the survey results from Section V. When asked about the government statement that the health risk in hairy crabs is low, 69.8 of the Taiwanese respondents disagreed (TW3). Also, 51.2% of Taiwanese respondents disagreed with the statement that the government has satisfactory ability in food safety probation and risk governance (TW5). For international comparisons, 48.8% (Taiwan), 56% (EU), 51% (UK), and 49% (Germany) of respondents agreed that public authorities are quick to act when a danger to citizens' health is identified (TW/EU23), while on the other hand, 49.2% (Taiwan), 33% (EU), 33% (UK), and 42% (Germany) disagreed. Also, 47.4% (Taiwan), 54% (EU), 53% (UK), and 45% (Germany) of respondents agreed that public authorities take citizens' concerns about health risks very seriously whilst 50.8% (Taiwan), 35% (EU), 31% (UK), and 44% (Germany) disagreed (TW/EU24).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 159, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1651, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Survey Results"}, {"text": "Moreover, 52.5% (Taiwan), 39% (EU), 39% (UK), and 34% (Germany) of respondents agreed that public authorities view the health of consumers as being more important than the profits of producers while 45.3% (Taiwan), 47% (EU), 43% (UK), and 54% (Germany) of respondents disagreed. Moreover, 36.4% (Taiwan), 50% (EU), 48% (UK), and 40% (Germany) of respondents agreed that public authorities do a good job informing people about risks related to food; conversely 60.7% (Taiwan), 39% (EU), 38% (UK), and 48% (Germany) disagreed (TW/EU30). For question TW/EU31, 53.2% (Taiwan), 58% (EU), 59% (UK), and 59% (Germany) of the respondents agreed that public authorities take into account most recent scientific evidence when they make decisions related to food risks. Lastly, regarding public appraisal of public authorities' actions with regards to food safety risks, 18.3% (Taiwan), 55% (EU), 62% (UK), and 64% (Germany) of respondents considered those actions appropriate while 79.7% (Taiwan), 33% (EU), 24% (UK), and 28% (Germany) considered them insufficient. From the above results, it can be observed that there is a gap in terms of public trust in the governments' governance capacity between Taiwan and other regions, particularly for public appraisal of public authorities' actions with regards to food safety risks (TW/EU32), with about 80% of Taiwanese respondents indicating they believed such actions insufficient.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Survey Results"}, {"text": "From the international comparisons, it is possible to observe that whether for risk communication, risk individualization, risk perception, legal information of food safety or public trust in governments' risk governance capacity, survey results from Taiwan were surprising because they showed evidence of problems in global food risk governance and risk communication. Usually, in normal risk perception surveys, the public's dissatisfaction and distrust are comparatively high during periods of risk related disputes but once the System Destroys Trust 53 dispute is resolved the level of distrust will gradually be restored. 11 However, while this has been the norm in food risk surveys, in the Taiwan survey it was observed that the level of doubt and distrust surrounding the government's governance capacity was very high. Synthetically speaking, about 70-80% of Taiwanese respondents agreed that they worried that the government may conceal risk information (Section I). Similarly, 70-80% of the Taiwanese respondents agreed that the problem of risk individualization is very serious (Section II). Compared to citizens of the EU, UK, and Germany, Taiwanese respondents expressed a stronger public perception of risks such as BSE, GMOs, weight gain, food additives, bacteria contamination, chemical substances formed in cooking process, dioxin or mercury pollution in foods, antibiotics or hormones in meats, pesticide residues and bird flu virus, averaging around 70-85% (Section III). In particular, for risks such as bacteria contamination in foods (TW/EU10), dioxin or mercury pollution in foods (TW/EU12), hormone or antibiotics in meats (TW/EU13) and pesticide residues (TW/EU13), as many as 90% of Taiwanese respondents expressed concern. However, although these issues also attracted public attention in the EU, UK, and Germany, only around 50-60% of the respondents revealed any worries. The results of this survey demonstrate a long term sense of dissatisfaction towards the government's governance style, particularly in relation to the lack of transparency of information; the incapability of the system to resolve risk; the increased pressure that the failure of the system has on the individual; a strong sense of worry in relation to the regulation of food pollution. Such results reinforce the concerns with the governance structural problems of newly emerging countries which was mentioned at the beginning of this research. At the same time this survey's results also reveal some distinctive aspects: the geographical and globalized levels are both worthy of a more detailed discussion; geographically, as a result of the fact that even until now there is still a lack of academic writing about the risk governance and society of many East Asian countries, it is therefore impossible to ascertain whether or not the phenomenon seen in Taiwan are prevalent in the area as a whole; at least on a globalized level, it is possible to clearly reflect on the conflict facing newly industrialized countries as they cope with the assault of globalization; on the one hand their governments must strive to catch up, lagging behind but trying to learn high tech industrialization and economic development (Wang 2007) while intentionally neglecting issues of social risk (Chou ibid.) , while on the other hand, when their society experiences the reality of globalized risk, being limited by the limitations of their technological governance model which in turn leads to strong criticism and sense of dissatisfaction. Such a dilemma reveals the distinct nature of governance while also showing the high level of anxiety in the public. Moreover, in relation to public perceptions of legal information relating to foods, Taiwanese respondents revealed a lower awareness of food safety and consumers' rights regulations (Section IV). With respect to public trust in governments' risk governance capacity, Taiwanese respondents expressed a greater degree of distrust compared with those surveyed in the EU, UK, and Germany, averaging 50-60% (Section V). Finally as many as 80% of respondents showed dissatisfaction with the governments' risk governance capacity (TW/EU32). Overall, these statistics demonstrate the confrontation between the government and the public brought to a head by global food risk issues. Even though risks 11 Take Taiwan's 2003 SARS case for example, the survey taken at the end of 2003 and 2004 demonstrate a significant different in public perceptions of government governance capacity. At the end of 2003 the level of public trust in the government's regulatory strategy, information communication and handling of the crisis was relatively low but in the following year the level of trust showed an obvious increase refer Chou (2006) . such as BSE, GMOs, and dioxin contamination originated from the UK and Belgium, before disseminating around Europe (for example, to Germany), we can see that EU members had made efforts in risk governance (L\u00f6fstedt 2002; European Commission 2002) to improve public trust. At the beginning of this research, in light of past experience, it was pointed out that there existed problems with the risk governance structure in Taiwan, and accordingly the governments serious failings in not valuing the public's risk perceptions, transparency of information channels and communication and involvement with and of the public. The delayed and hidden response of the regulatory culture that this type of governance structure created, led to the public, in times of disputes finding themselves ignorant of how to respond and the effects of this emerged as a high level of anxiety in the public and a high level of distrust towards the government. The results of this survey have not only reasserted the original hypothesis of this paper but have also gone one step further in verifying it. Again, in the historical context of an authoritarian regime, the factors that cause this phenomenon can be discussed in three dimensions: expert politics, governance and assessment ideologies, and social amplification of risk.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3218, "end": 3229, "text": "(Wang 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3283, "end": 3295, "text": "(Chou ibid.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4757, "end": 4768, "text": "Chou (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 4976, "end": 4991, "text": "(L\u00f6fstedt 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 4992, "end": 5017, "text": "European Commission 2002)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "From the 1960s, the Cold War legitimatized authoritarian government in some newly industrialized Asian countries.

Despite experiencing the third wave of democratization in the 1980s, for complicated technological and risk affairs that are accessible to the public, authoritarian governance structure continued to function as before. In other words, the authoritarian culture and expert politics have fused together to create a scientific regime which makes decisions without consulting others, possessing the dominant influence in risk related policy making. When carrying out risk assessment this scientific regime is equally assertive in its assertion that positivist scientific led decision making is the only acceptable model; in the process seriously neglecting public risk communication and public risk perception. Therefore, the double entanglement of authoritarian expert politics and positivist scientific assessment has created an equally distinct scientific and risk regulatory culture. Against this background, the government became a risk regulator that was active in risk governance but seriously amiss in its social rationality. This has raised considerable disputes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Besides the hairy crab issue (2006), risks such as GMOs (from 2000), dioxin contamination in milk (2004), dioxin contamination in duck and duck eggs (2005) , and BSE all indicate the governance dilemma of expert politics-following parochial scientific assessment, and authoritarian expertise, and delayed and hidden governance culture (Chou 2007a, b ). This governance model accumulatively formed a special structural risk governance culture and regulatory problems in Taiwan, consequently creating tensions between state and society. From the perspective of social amplification of risk, the long-term, structurally delayed and hidden risk regulation is quite disadvantageous to sensitive and vulnerable public perception. In particular, the state often institutionally ignores risk communication and thus public doubts increase, as does pubic distrust. This research shows that, to certain degree, the public are worried the state may conceal related risk information in the future. Also, in this case, the public perceived that individuals within the public were forced to shoulder high risk responsibilities. Such distinct risk governance culture can be shown to be the reason why Taiwanese citizens have such a high degree of risk perception and worry. Compared to the EU, UK, and Germany, the failure of the government in its responsibilities to global risk disputes such as food contamination and food additive limitation attracted greater attention from Taiwanese citizens.

However, for some advanced democratic continental countries, the legitimacy of decision-making is still being challenged and in need of prompt improvement. While for newly industrialized countries, with their special governance structure and regulatory cultures, the social engineering of risk governance encounters greater challenges in terms of value paradigm and structure change. As the state (expert politics) and society (social rationality) is in a high state of confrontation, public distrust in risk disputes continues, and a risk governance paradigm shift is occurring. Through institutional resolution upon the occurrence of consecutive risk issues, public participation, information transparency and risk communication should be included in a democratic decision-making process.
