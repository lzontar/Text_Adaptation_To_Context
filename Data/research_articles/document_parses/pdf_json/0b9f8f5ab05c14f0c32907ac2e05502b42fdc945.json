There are global efforts to develop new vaccines for the control of diseases of global health importance.

As of September 24, 2018, a snapshot of total registered vaccine clinical trials on the US National Institute of Health (NIH) Library of Medicine's portal revealed 6677 ongoing vaccine clinical trials across the world with only 347 (~5%) taking place in Africa. However, there is a disproportional distribution of vaccine trials on the African continent with approximately a third of these vaccine trials attributable to the Republic of South Africa (RSA). West Africa, including all Lassa fever (LF)-affected countries, contributed 35% (121) of Africa's vaccine trials; however, most of these trials (~83%) occurred in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, and Senegal. Out of the 8 Lassa-affected countries, the three worst-hit (Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Liberia) account for only 12% of vaccine trials in West Africa, further underlining the gap and inequity in the distribution of this critical component of Research and Development (R&D) [4] . It should also be noted that only 22% of these studies were phase I trials with the majority being phase II, III, and post-vaccine introduction effectiveness studies [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 280, "end": 283, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 391, "end": 394, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 395, "end": 397, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1352, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1524, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Clinical research demands careful consideration of ethical, scientific, methodological, and operational aspects of each study [5] .

Also, previous experience with clinical trials, especially involving vaccines, is a useful indicator of successful clinical trial management. Other factors include having the required equipment, personnel, and procedures to handle the investigational product (IP). Familiarity with trial procedures, e.g., contracting, informed consent process, and submissions to ethical and regulatory authorities, is also an important consideration. Of recent, a significant number of clinical trials are experiencing delays due to many factors, the majority of which are associated with the appropriateness of the clinical trial site and challenges with patient recruitment [5] [6] [7] . The inability to recruit enough study subjects increases the length of the enrollment period with the attendant increase in operational cost. The time and cost of maintaining a site between and during clinical trials could gulp a considerable amount of funds, which under-performing sites would not be able to justify. Also, sites with inexperienced or unskilled investigators are more likely to incur protocol infractions or to have low-quality data that will require further training, on-site visits, and more queries for clarification, all of which impacts costs and study duration [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 126, "end": 129, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1134, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1138, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1142, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1733, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although North America and Western Europe continue to lead the world's clinical trial map, patients' recruitment remains a challenge, causing significant delays (plus additional cost) to the conduct of clinical trials in these countries. A reduction in time and cost of conducting a clinical trial has become more critical as competition to bring new drugs and vaccines to the market is increasing. These challenges have prompted most sponsors to look towards conducting clinical trials in developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa [6] . These regions are under-represented in research, yet these populations stand to gain more from research as their infectious diseases' burden and the need for effective vaccines is higher than that of developed countries. Conducting clinical trials in Africa is deemed challenging because of perceived problems with getting valid informed consent, ethical compensation mechanisms for indigent populations, poor health infrastructure, and considerable socio-economic and cultural divides. However, these countries could also offer an attractive setting for clinical trials [8] . Conducting clinical trials in sub-Sahara Africa promotes access to innovative medical countermeasures and enhances the research capacities of scientists in these countries [9] . Importantly, clinical trials need to be responsive to the needs of host communities. Based on the high prevalence of Lassa fever in West Africa, it is important to conduct the clinical trials within the setting to allow for an assessment of the potential impact of factors such as disease epidemiology, health service needs, social determinants of health, presence of comorbidities, compliance, and genetic make-up on the efficacy and effectiveness of the eventual vaccine [10] . This also ensures that recommendations of the use of Lassa virus (LASV) vaccine in these countries are based on appropriate benefit-risk assessments especially because available evidence suggests that differences might exist in the rate of enzymemediated metabolism of drugs and biologics between different populations based on genetic mutations [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 591, "end": 594, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1349, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1829, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2178, "end": 2182, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "However, there are significant challenges in the clinical testing of LASV vaccine candidates and the eventual delivery to populations in need.

The questions sought information on four broad categories based on the WHO/TDR competency wheel [13] : these include scientific thinking, ethics, quality/risk management, study and site(s) management, and research operations. A quantitative score was allocated to each question in an empirical, but systematic fashion based on the lead author's experience and perceived importance of the question to the conduct of LF vaccine clinical trials. The score was calculated in Excel using \"if-conditions\" in the formulas, e.g., if the question \"Is the site accessible by road?\" was answered with \"Yes,\" the score column was automatically set to 1, any other answer led to \"No.\" The more answers that were possible, the more nesting for the if-conditions that were necessary. For the others, multiplying or dividing factors were used as appropriate, e. g., a previous history of successful conduct of vaccine clinical trial carried twice the score of a previous drug clinical trial. The total number of staff per site was divided by a factor of 2 (up to 32 staff) to give a maximum score of 16. Also, having the ability to conduct nucleic acid-based diagnosis (PCR) attracted a score of 10 due to its importance to LF diagnosis. Analysis of the quantitative data and calculation of the scores per site were done using a Microsoft Excel-based template aimed at categorizing the trial sites based on their score over a defined total maximum score of 100.

The scenario was different for Nigeria, where only 3 of 14 sites could be assigned to this category, and Liberia and Sierra Leone with no site in this category. Another common theme to most of the sites in these 3 countries was the lack of history of significant vaccine clinical trials.

While developing vaccine candidates requires significant financial investment in R&D, testing the vaccines in human populations requires the presence of research sites with human resources, facilities, and processes capable of conducting high-quality clinical trials. The results of this site survey indicated that most of the clinical trial sites were willing to perform vaccine trials in the future, provided capacity gaps can be addressed. Most of the identified gaps were within the purview of clinical and laboratory infrastructures, experience with sponsored vaccines and drug clinical trials, and investigational product handling. Partnership with pharmaceutical companies and relevant non-profit sector players is necessary to address these gaps. This experience with a systematic and comparative method of site assessment is encouraging, and the site selection method used can serve as guidance with points to consider for sponsors and researchers planning clinical trials. Site visits are ongoing to confirm the results of this survey. Until this process is complete, it may be difficult to conclude that the scorecard successfully predict which site could successfully hold vaccine trials. Further studies and publications are required to compare the data collected online with those obtained from actual site visits as well as to improve on the context of the questionnaire tool to improve its ability to gather more in-depth information as specified in the WHO/TDR competency wheel for clinical trials.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Supplementary information accompanies this paper at https://doi.org/10. 1186/s40814-020-00567-4.Additional file 1: Table S1 Scorecard template.
