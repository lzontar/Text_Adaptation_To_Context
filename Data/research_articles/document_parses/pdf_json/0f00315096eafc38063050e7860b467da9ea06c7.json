Over the last few months, the infection has spread to several countries worldwide. Coronaviruses are described by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a large family of viruses, which may cause illness in animals or humans (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/ q-a-coronaviruses). Although COVID-19 infections in humans most often present with mild symptoms, in a variable percentage of cases, it can cause an acute respiratory syndrome, which has led to patient fatalities (Phan 2020 , Lu et al. 2020 . COVID-19 appears to be a particular risk for patient with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes; https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coron aviruses).",

It is also of note that no specific antiviral therapy has currently proven to be effective against SARS CoV-2 (the virus causing the disease COVID-19). This combination of no vaccine as well as no effective therapeutic countermeasure is potentially leading to an unknown but possibly challenging scenario with millions of people becoming infected globally. This would inevitably have a major impact on daily life, with the potential to drive even the healthcare systems in developed countries to the brink of collapse.",

Symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to those of human influenza and include a fever, cough, rhinitis, myalgia, conjunctivitis and fatigue. From a European perspective, at least two separate clusters of infection have been identified in Northern Italy. The entire area of Italy is now a 'red zone' with multiple limitations imposed on education, work and transport. However, considering the rapid spread of the virus, additional restrictions on the movement of the population are being considered in an attempt to reduce the number of patients.",

Notably, the spread of the It is important to emphasize that prolonged close face-to-face contact between patients and operators during endodontic treatment creates a high risk for cross-infection. The contact between the mouth of the patients and the production of aerosols through the use of high-speed handpieces would appear to create a substantial risk for contamination and spread of the virus within dental clinics. Thus, routine endodontic therapies and emergency treatments are high risk for virus contamination. Furthermore, it is likely that University Dental Clinics and Dental Hospitals, where patients, students and teachers share the same spaces, may potentially create a reservoir and 'hub' for the spread of the virus. To confirm this potential within medicine, the virus has infected a large number of hospital healthcare doctors and nursing staff.",

Regular, meticulous and effective hand washing with no touching of face, eyes etc; use of face masks; 5. Decontamination of all surfaces within clinics with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite or 70% ethanol or 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, which are disinfectants already available in dental clinics (Kampf et al. 2020 ); 6.

Special precautions by dentists and assistants to prevent contamination from air droplets: a. Wear a disposable surgical mask and isolate the patient in a dedicated single-patient room (with closed door) separated from other staff/ patients; b. When possible, use a rubber dam that must cover the nose of patient during the entire endodontic procedure; c. Application of powerful air/water surgical suction pump (aspirator) close to the tooth and a second suction close to the nose to prevent aerosol and saliva droplet diffusion; d. If possible, use high-speed handpiece with no exhaust; e. Decontamination of equipment, surgeries/operatories after reach patient.
