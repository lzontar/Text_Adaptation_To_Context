Gu\u00e9rin are at high risk for developing severe pneumonia and subsequent ARDS. Prone positioning is therefore a common strategy in their intensive care as well.",

Turning a patient is time-consuming, requires multiple individuals and therefore multiple exposures, and increases the risk for adverse events like endotracheal tube displacement and disconnection of arterial and venous lines. In the prone position, the proper hand positioning is important. Kwon et al 3 reported that the largest left ventricular cross-sectional area is 0-2 vertebral segments below the inferior angle of the scapula in at least 86% of patients in patients positioned prone.",

The analysis indicates that in the prone position, SBP was statistically significantly higher than in supine position (mean difference [MD] = 24.00; 95% CI, 5.79-42.21; P = .010), while in DBP, the difference was not statistically significant (MD = 4.00; 95% CI, \u22123.65 to 11.65; P = .31). Mazer et el 5 reported the advantage of prone position over the supine position in the context of SBP (72 vs 48 mm Hg; P < .05; mean arterial pressure (46 vs 32 mm Hg; P < .05) and DBP (34 vs 24 mm Hg; P > .05).",

Injuries to ribs, spine, scapula, clavicles, or eyeballs and shoulder dislocation are possible. The effectiveness of CPR is affected by the depth of chest compressions and therefore it is still recommended to place the patient on a hard surface or to place a hard board under the patient. ARDS patients are placed in prone position for several hours, while COVID-19 ARDS patients for even 12-18 hours or more. The prone position is also used in patients undergoing noninvasive ventilation, in spontaneously breathing nonintubated patients, for example, due to refractory hypoxemia in acute respiratory failure including lung transplantation. 6 In summary, CPR in the prone position seems to be a reliable method to provide CPR in patients positioned prone.",
