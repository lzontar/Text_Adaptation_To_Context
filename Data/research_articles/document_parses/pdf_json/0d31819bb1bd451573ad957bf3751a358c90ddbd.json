The concomitant graft dysfunction presented a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. The differential included rejection, the most common cause in the first year post transplant, as well as non-rejection mechanisms, specifically viral myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy, both of which have been described in COVID-19 (5, 6) . The approach to management would greatly vary depending on the leading consideration, as treatment for rejection may be contradictory to that of a severe viral infection. A biopsy done at the time of arrhythmia showed no rejection or myocarditis, and there were no detectable donor specific antibodies. Serum COVID PCR done 2 days after the abnormal echo was negative. We concluded that without any specific evidence for rejection or myocarditis, our patient most likely experienced transient stress injury to the allograft from critical illness that resolved as his condition improved.",
