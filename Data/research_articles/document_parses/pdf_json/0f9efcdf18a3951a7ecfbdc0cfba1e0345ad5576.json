The diagnosis of MP infection is based on serologic test and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mild community-acquired pneumonia and severe community-acquired pneumonia are defined based on the criteria described [30] [31] [32] . Mild is defined as respiratory rate <70 breaths/min at age <3 years old or respiratory rate <50 breaths/min at age \u22653 years old, normal food-intake, no dehydration 33 . Severe is defined as respiratory rate \u226570 breaths/min at age <3 years old or respiratory rate >50 breaths/min at age \u22653 years old, cyanosis, flaring of the nares, marked retractions, anorexia and dehydration; or MPP combined with pleural effusion, lung necrosis/lung abscess and other complications in lung; or MPP combined with dysfunction of other systems 34 . By measuring the maximum thickness of fluid between the visceral and parietal pleurae on a CT scan, pleural effusion was defined as fluid thickness >5 mm 35 . Children with other respiratory infections and tuberculosis are excluded in terms of the following tests: purified-protein derivative (PPD), blood culture, pleural effusion culture, nasopharyngeal suction/swab culture, nasopharyngeal suction/ swab virus antigen detection and serology for Chlamydia pneumonia and Legionella pneumonia. Children, who had asthma, repeated respiratory infections, chronic heart disease, rheumatic diseases or immune deficiencies are also excluded. BALF samples are collected only from children with acute MPP before treatment. Children with mild MPP are only chosen when they hav segmental or lobular pneumonia. Children with FB are included as control, which had no respiratory tract illness in the previous 6 weeks. At the moment of sample collecting, the FB children had no clinical symptom, no sign of lung inflammation or infection observed under brochoscopy. diagnose and treat lobar pneumonia or segmental pneumonia, flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed within three days after admission. BALF was gently aspirated, collected and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 \u00b0C within 1 hour after collection. The supernatant was divided into 300 \u00b5l aliquots and stored in \u221240 \u00b0C freezer. cytokine assay. Cytokine levels were determined using a Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel kit (HCYTOMAG-60K, Millipore, Billerica, MA) following the manufacturer's protocol 37 . BALF samples and serial diluted standards were added to 96 well plates and incubated overnight in 4 \u00b0C. Each sample was added into two replicate wells. Then, plates were run on the Luminex 200 \u2122 machine with xPONENT 3.1 software. We utilized MILLIPLEX Analysis 5.1 software to calculate the assay sensitivities (minimum detectable concentrations, minDC, pg/mL) and analyze the Luminex assay results. The sensitivities of each cytokine were listed in Supplementary Table S2 . The accuracy and precision of the kit were showed in Supplementary Table S3 . Sample concentrations were determined using a 5-point logistic curve fitting algorithm in the software. Results were accepted as final if the coefficient of variation (CV) <10%. The CV of each children group can be found in Supplementary Table S4 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 471, "end": 475, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 476, "end": 480, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 481, "end": 485, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 652, "end": 654, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1017, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1176, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2626, "end": 2628, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3081, "end": 3103, "text": "Supplementary Table S2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3159, "end": 3181, "text": "Supplementary Table S3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 3408, "end": 3430, "text": "Supplementary Table S4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Methods clinical information."}, {"text": "Real-time quantitative pcR (qpcR).
