Two current points I would make however is that it must be latex free, hence the use of the term dental dam as opposed to rubber dam. Also the dam should be brought up over the nostrils, for obvious reasons. However, patients are sometimes resistant to this and they will have to be coaxed gently, explaining why covering the nose is necessary. I have never had a problem with this and frankly if a patient was adamant now that they did not want the nose covered I would decline treatment.",

            "text": "Sir, dexamethasone has recently been in the news as a potential treatment for COVID-19 and the severe immune response, which is believed to cause a lot of the more severe medical problems experienced by patients acutely ill from the disease. Has this medication perhaps got a dental use also which may have been valuable during this crisis when access to urgent dental care was limited? I remember attending an endodontic course including lectures from renowned endodontist, Julian Webber. He was a strong advocate for the use of oral dexamethasone for controlling pulpitis when operative care wasn't immediately available, a treatment option which has evidence to back it. 1 What could have perhaps been very useful was access to dexamethasone via the dental formulary to help treat many of the patients suffering with pulpitis for which the principle of AAA probably did little to relieve their severe pain in the absence of dental treatment. If deemed acceptable by the necessary experts could it be adapted more widely as an additional medication we can ",

            "text": "Sir, what constitutes an aerosol generating procedure (AGP) is in dispute between the British Orthodontic Society (BOS) and the Office of the Chief Dental Officer, England (OCDO). The guidance from the OCDO is that using a slow handpiece for caries removal with high volume suction does not produce an aerosol, 1 while the BOS' view is that for removing composite after a fixed appliance debond, it does. 2 The BOS has therefore advised its members that all orthodontic procedures could be undertaken with personal protective equipment (PPE) appropriate for non-AGP, but should include the use of a fluid resistant surgical mask (FRSM) and high volume evacuation (HVE), as well. 3 The BOS' view is that the corollary use of a rubber dam would be limited in its practical application where multiple teeth are concerned and being technique sensitive, many orthodontists would be unskilled at present. 2 These are understandable concerns, but neither problem is insurmountable. Almost three decades ago, the use of a rubber dam while debonding fixed appliance ceramic brackets was recommended as a means of protecting a patient's airway during a process that could result in the disintegration and aspiration of a radiolucent ceramic fragment. 4 While some orthodontists might need ab initio training in rubber dam placement, for others a refresher session should suffice. It would be no more time consuming or challenging than having to learn how to don and doff AGP PPE and it would generate less contaminated waste.",
