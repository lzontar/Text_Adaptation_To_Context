First, the paper provides a high-level, general review of the current efforts to provide healthcare services in underserved areas and the many efforts being made to impact health outcomes by various international, governmental, and NGO entities. We also very briefly review university programs and research institutions that have specific technical and institutional assets with significant potential to carry out research or to partially implement such a plan. Our review uses weighted values in a decisionsystem that takes in a variety of assets we consider fundamental to successful engagement in delivery of new, innovative, technology-enabled healthcare systems for underresourced settings. We then review nine factors that hinder the advancement in healthcare in under-resourced settings, some of which are well described in current literature and some that may bring new perspectives. The paper then attempts to review how a proposed system can manage to operate successfully within the context of the nine named hindrance factors. The primary focus of the paper is in the description of a system which can increase the availability of diagnostics through technology-enabled systems. Such a system would impact the outcomes of persons in underserved regions. The paper then describes why making diagnostics available is a critical priority among efforts for improvements in global health.",

            "text": "Testing. On the question of increasing voluntary epidemiological testing, the situation changes in the context we propose. Patients become less fearful of these tests when their own symptoms drive them to seek care in the first place. They are seeking the health services to help them understand the cause of the symptoms they are experiencing, under the assumption that the system is capable of not only a diagnosis, but of recommending treatments, some of which may be available locally, once diagnosis is confirmed. For example, the WHO Infectious Disease Target Testing List (shown on Appendix B) lists 37 communicable diseases. In fact, many of the diseases listed on the WHO Infectious Disease Target Testing List can be treated locally (in small clinics, upon confirmed diagnosis) because specific and highly effective drugs have been developed for these conditions. In cases where local treatment is not appropriate, or where local clinics cannot manage the use of certain drugs due to storage requirements or other limiting conditions, arrangements can be made to otherwise serve these patients.",

At least one highly functional AI reading system is available (25) Mammography: a technology has been identified, requiring additional translational research, that can provide small device and smart AI reading of cross-linked imaging data (26) Nerve Conduction Study/Nerve Velocity Study (NCS/ NVS): simple devices have been identified with AI support (27) Ophthalmoscopy: four new methods/devices have been identified (including AI routines) to diagnose many common eye conditions (28) Paracentesis: via discrete protein detection in blood (29) Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT's)/Spirometry: test identified that perform 23 test vectors (complete); Three other candidate test devices have been identified (30) Reflex Tests/Pupillary Reflex Test: system tutorials; Pupillary reflex new AI (31) Replacement for Spinal tap procedures (lumbar puncture): we are proposing to replace spinal tap tests with tests for specific blood biomarkers based on specific test purpose/ prediagnosis indications; several such tests have been identified (32) Ultrasonography: we have identified new AI guided routines for high quality image capture (33) X-ray (General, Injury Assessment): new small, portable, smart devices For obvious reasons, large imaging devices are not available for small clinics. Similarly, tests requiring high rated clean rooms.
