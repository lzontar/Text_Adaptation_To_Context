In developed societies, it is most frequently diagnosed in the workers of the healthcare, cleaning services, farming, and industry sectors. 5 It can be speculated that the relative prevalence of occupational HE will rise in healthcare professionals, while it is likely to remain similar in farming and slightly decrease in the workers of other sectors due to workplace restrictions. In view of the above, we believe that primary prevention of HE should be intensively promoted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions include using moisturizers in combination with barrier creams and constant education on skin protection. 4 In case of active HE, a detailed history must always be taken, and additional examination such as patch skin testing or atopy score should be considered to identify underlying contact allergy or atopic dermatitis. 6 The treatment of HE varies based on the severity of symptoms and disease phase (acute, chronic), with emollients and moisturizers being the baseline. Topical steroids such as clobetasol propionate and mometasone furoate are usually the first-choice anti-inflammatory agents, though they may interfere with the skin barrier regeneration and thus their long-term This article is protected by copyright.

COVID-19 may cause pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which are the leading causes of death in the infected individuals. 1 The large proportion of asymptomatic carriers combined with significant infectivity of the novel coronavirus has prompted a shift in social behavior in order to prevent its spread. Preventive measures currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) include social distancing, avoiding of touching the face, covering the mouth and nose during coughing or sneezing, and frequent hand washing using soap or alcohol-based disinfectants. 2 Other methods increasingly growing in popularity include wearing masks and occlusive, disposable gloves.",
