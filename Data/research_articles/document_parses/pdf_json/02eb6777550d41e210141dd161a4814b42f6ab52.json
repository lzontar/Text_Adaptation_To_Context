Green 8 innovative enterprises are a new type of enterprise that merged in recent years to address 9 environmental pollution and promote green development (Schiederig, Tietze et al. 2012, Singh, 10 Chen et al. 2019). Some scholars have studied the survival and development of green innovation 11 companies, and Winston studied how green innovation companies can achieve leading 12 development positions when other companies are stagnant (Winston 2019). Chen used 13 questionnaire data and established a multiple regression model to empirically analyze the 14 relationship between government subsidies and the survival of green innovation companies (Chen, 15 Zhang et al. 2017). In China, the scale of green innovation companies is generally small, and the 16 establishment time is not long, but the development of green innovation companies plays a huge 17 role in promoting the improvement of the environment (Hu 2017). Currently, the relevant research 18 on the survival of green innovative companies is relatively weak, and only the impact of specific 19 factors on survival has been analyzed from the perspective of quantitative research.

The six combinations of the above six factors can explain the survival of 6 most Chinese green innovative enterprises, but these factors alone cannot constitute a sufficient 7 condition for the survival of green innovative enterprises. Only by forming a specific path 8 combination can the survival of enterprises be improved. 9Due to the multiple variable settings in this paper, the path is relatively complicated, and it 10 can be seen that green innovative enterprises exist in a pattern of a hundred flowers blossoming --11 not a single model. The key point of our research is to determine the resources that can effectively 12 prevent the death of enterprises. What abilities can enterprises use to help themselves survive 13 better? Combined with these problems, this paper analyzes enterprises from the perspectives of 14 internal and external factors to explain how different enterprises should use their own resources 15 and capabilities to continue their specific survival. 16 From the perspective of the three factors of the dynamic capability of enterprises, 17 Government Support has appeared four times in the six paths, and most of them are positive, so it 18 plays the most important role in the survival of enterprises; The lack of government resources can 19 be compensated for by cooperation with universities to promote the better survival of enterprises. 20 However, Technology Introduction did not help green innovative enterprises to improve their 21 viability, in contrast to Wagner's findings (Wagner 2013).

Thus, how should China's high R&D enterprises of green innovative enterprises survive? In light of this problem, this paper returns to the case for 1 in-depth investigation and finds that the three high R&D enterprises are Green Water Source 2 Technology Co., Ltd. (Green-Water Source), Tianjin Teda Environmental Protection Co., Ltd. 3 (Teda Environmental Protection), and Shenfu Technology Co., Ltd. (Shenfu Technology). Each 4 spends more than 5 percent of revenues on research and development, but the three companies 5show very different outcomes. Green-Water Source and Teda Environmental Protection survived a 6 decade later, but the operation of Shenfu Technology appeared abnormal, and it is clear that high 7 R&D will not lead to the death of enterprises. At the same time, the study found that the 8 combination of \"high R&D\" and \"high product competitiveness\" can promote the survival of 9enterprises. That is, if the result of research and development does not bring competitive products, 10 then the enterprise will spend too much energy on research and development, leading to the 11 enterprise finding it difficult to survive. Shenwu Technology is a good example. From 2010 to 12 2012, R&D expenditures accounted for 6.7%, 7.4% and 9.7% of sales revenue, respectively. The 13 product developed by the company --regenerative high temperature air combustion technology --14 has saved production capacity to some extent, but it does not have a comparative advantage in 15 terms of price, so the company has not developed well. In contrast, GreenWater Source and Teda16 Environmental Protection, with high R&D investment, at the same time achieve comprehensive 17 utilization of pollutant resources and greatly reduce the operating costs of enterprises, thus 18 ensuring the healthy operation of enterprises. 19 R&D is very important for the survival and development of enterprises. Even if low research 20 and development enterprises can survive for a short time, it is not conducive to their long-term 21 development. However, due to the slow start, small scale and poor antirisk capability of China's 22 green innovative enterprises, if the R&D investment fails to produce competitive products in time, 1 then the enterprises will soon fall into business difficulties and lead to failure. Therefore, to solve 2 the research and development dilemma of enterprises and realize the virtuous circle of \"R&D -3 output -profit -R&D\" is the means for the long-term development of China's green innovative 4 enterprises. 5 5.2 The influence of coordinated development of internal and 6 external capabilities on enterprise survival 7From the perspective of resource-based capability and dynamic capability, this paper 8 discusses the influence of these two dimensions on enterprise survival and enterprise death, 9respectively. The results of fsQCA combined path analysis show that the absence of any type of 10 ability will affect the viability of the enterprise, and resource-based capability has a greater impact 11 on enterprise death, with dynamic capability having a greater impact on enterprise survival. 12According to the two-factor theory, if an enterprise wants to survive for a long time, then it must 13 build a dynamic ability to support the development of the enterprise, while the resource-based 14 capability plays a fundamental role. Although the resource-based capability cannot guarantee the 15 long-term survival of the enterprise, the shortage of resources will lead to the death of the16 enterprise, which also verifies previous research conclusions, as Cheah et al. suggested that 17 external institutional support behavior for enterprises plays a dominant role in enterprise 18 performance, such as some financial support and training support from the government, industry 19 partners, and charity organizations (Cheah, Amran et al. 2019).
