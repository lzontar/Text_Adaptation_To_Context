Lung function was evaluated both at baseline and after 5-h ventilation. Lung injury was assessed by histological examination, lung water and protein contents in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Pulmonary oxidative stress was examined by concentrations of methylguanidine (MG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in BALF, and antioxidative activity by protein expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) in the lung. Severity of lung inflammation was evaluated by white blood cell and differential count in BALF, and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and mRNA expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in the lung. We also examined protein expression of surfactant protein (SP)-A and D and we measured hourly changes in serum nitric oxide (NO) level. Results: Five hours of LTV ventilation did not induce a major change in lung function, whereas 5 h of HTV ventilation induced apparent combined restrictive and obstructive lung disorder, together with increased pulmonary oxidative stress, decreased anti-oxidative activity and increased lung inflammation (P < 0.05). HTV ventilation also decreased SP-A and SP-D expression and suppressed serum NO level during the time course of ventilation. Cu/Zn SOD administered intravenously during HTV ventilation effectively reversed associated pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation (P < 0.05); moreover, it preserved SP-A and SP-D expressions in the lung and increased serum nitric oxide (NO) level, enhancing vascular NO bioavailability.",

On the other hand, evidence from patient's studies indicates that mechanical ventilation is one of the primary factors leading to hospital-acquired lung injury, and patients with burn injury, trauma or pre-existing respiratory diseases are particularly at high risks [40] . A recent survey of patients having cardiac surgery revealed that though most patients do not have signs of pulmonary dysfunction or lung injury prior to the surgery, some eventually develop perioperative lung injury [18] . Though the exact mechanism responsible is uncertain, higher tidal volume employed commonly to reduce risks of hypoxemia and pulmonary atelectasis is thought to play a critical role [38] .",

            "text": "Pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation had been implicated in the pathogenesis of ventilator-associated pulmonary dysfunction and lung injury [10, 15, 60, 68] . Overinflating alveoli and repeated stretching of lung tissues can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and diminish prostanoid synthesis that promotes redox imbalance and cyclooxygenase induction and inflammatory responses [68] . Also, formation of ROS disrupts the regulation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) causing nitrotyrosine accumulation, irregular tracheal mucus secretion, and increased airway resistance [63] . In addition, stretching lung tissues directly alters metabolism and secretion of pulmonary surfactant proteins (SPs) that mediate alveolar surface tension and lung compliance, while surfactant protein-A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) augment pulmonary immune defense mechanisms and inhibit endogenous lipid peroxidation [4] . Moreover, excessive lung stretch activates nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) that mediates the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that, in turn, promote adhesion molecule expression [28] and facilitate inflammatory cell infiltration in lung [34] . For over two decades, low tidal volume ventilation has been proposed as a protective strategy; still ventilator-associated lung injury is not uncommon and, thus far, there is still no consensus regarding the optimal ventilation strategy [48] . Terragni et al. [76] reported that even a well-accepted protective ventilation strategy, namely a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a plateau pressure \u2264 30 cm H 2 O, may not protect all patients against ventilator-induced pulmonary dysfunction. Consequently, an effective pharmacological intervention may be necessary to protect ventilator-associated pulmonary dysfunction and lung injury.",

            "text": "Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an important antioxidant, active in endothelial cells, cytoplasm and mitochondrial intermembrane matrix [57] . It protects cells against superoxide damage through catalyzing the dismutation of superoxide radicals into molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide [50, 57] and thus inhibits peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative protein modification and cell membrane lipid peroxidation [27] . Moreover, SOD can facilitate vascular function, increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability through competing with NO for superoxide anions [31] . SOD was also shown to inhibit neutrophil-mediated inflammation through regulating neutrophil apoptosis [85] . Despite all the benefits and no major side effects, therapeutic efficacy of SOD treatment on tissue damage, in general, has been limited by its short circulatory halflife and low transcapillary permeability, due to its relatively large molecular size (molecular weight~32 kDa) [84] . On the other hand, intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD has been demonstrated to be effective against hyperoxia-induced lung injury [53] . Though the authors did not provide explanation of why SOD treatment was so effective in hyperoxic lung injury, its protective effectiveness is likely related to its substantial permeability across the pulmonary capillary. Increased albumin concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is the hallmark of hyperoxic lung injury [53] and the molecular weight (\u223c69 kDa) of albumin is more than twice that of SOD. Albumin leak is also characteristic of ventilator-induced lung injury [80] and we suggest that the observed protective efficacy of intravenously administered SOD may imply substantial transcapillary permeability.",

We have identified pulmonary oxidative stress and lung inflammation and reduced expression of pulmonary surfactant protein (SP)-A and D as the main contributors to the impairment of lung function and observed that intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD effectively reversed mechanical ventilationassociated detrimental effects.

The inspiratory/expiratory ratio for those ventilated with LTV and HTV were 0.25 and 0.45, respectively. Other ventilatory parameters including positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP = 0 cmH 2 O; positive PEEP has been shown to have lung protective effectiveness [1] ) fraction of inspired oxygen (0.21), respiratory rate (60 stroke/min) were identical between groups. HTV-ventilated rats were administered intravenously either with Cu/Zn SOD (HTV + SOD, n = 14) or with an equal amount of saline (HTV; n = 14); the same amount of saline was also administered intravenously to LTV-ventilated rats. Human erythrocyte Cu/Zn SOD (S9636-15KU, Sigma-Aldrich Co., MO, US) was administered at a dose of 1000 U/kg/h via a high-precision syringe pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA) during the entire course of ventilation. The dose adopted was determined in a preliminary study, in which 4 doses (200, 500, 1000 and 2000 U/kg/h) were administered during HTV ventilation, the outcome being assessed by means of lung function testing, and concentrations of methylguanidine (MG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in BALF. Results were dose-dependent, but no major differences were observed between rats treated with 1000 U/kg/h and those with 2000 U/kg/h. In order to maintain the blood pH within 7.30-7.45 during HTV ventilation, an external dead space was added by increasing the volume of intubation tubing [61] . In another study, heat denatured Cu/Zn SOD (1000 U/kg/h) was treated during HTV ventilation; the results of lung function testing and tissue MDA level were compared to those assessed in the HTV group and showed no significant difference, suggesting no protective effectiveness of heat denatured Cu/Zn SOD. At the end of study, rats were euthanized by an overdose of anesthetic (200 mg/kg i.p). The lungs and trachea were removed for BALF measurements, assessments of lung water and histological analysis, and subsequent analyses of protein and mRNA expression.",

We observed that though both LTV and HTV ventilation decreased serum NO, LTV ventilation decreased serum NO primarily during the first 2 h of ventilation (P < 0.05), whereas HTV ventilation decreased serum NO throughout most of the 5-h ventilation (P < 0.05). Notably, SOD administration monotonically increased serum level of NO during the course of HTV ventilation. We assessed the level of pulmonary antioxidant defense via the protein expression of glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) [70] , and the degree of lung inflammation by means of protein expressions of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; it mediates the adhesion of lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils to vascular endothelium), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; it functions as a downstream inflammatory mediator of NF-\u03baB [6] ), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9; it activates extracellular matrix remodeling and facilitates inflammatory cell recruitment across the epithelium [9] ), and surfactant protein A and D (SP-A and SP-D; they mediate pulmonary innate immune function [47] and the latter has been demonstrated to modulate ventilator-induced lung inflammation [67] ), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1; it functions as an essential inflammatory mediator that exerts its effector actions through activation of a transcription factor), and mRNA expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB; it plays b a LTV HTV HTV+SOD Though absolute macrophages (lower panel) increased after HTV ventilation, the percent macrophages decreased.

Figure  8 shows that HTV ventilation markedly increased VCAM-1, TNF-\u03b1 and MMP-9 (P < 0.05), while decreased SP-A and SP-D expressions in lung (P < 0.05) as compared with those assessed in the LTV group (n = 3 each). Intravenous SOD administration effectively attenuated HTV ventilation-associated increases in protein expressions of VCAM-1, TNF-\u03b1 and MMP-9, while improved suppressed protein expressions of SP-A and SP-D in lung (P < 0.05). Although lung tissue expressions of GPx-1 and iNOS in the HTV group were not significantly different from those measured in the LTV group, intravenous SOD administration markedly increased the protein expression of GPx-1 while decreased protein expression of iNOS (P < 0.05), suggesting improved antioxidant defense and reduced inflammation in lung.",

In addition, HTV ventilation significantly increased levels of pulmonary hydroxyl radical formation and lipid peroxidation, inflammatory cell infiltration and sequestration, and markedly increased lung inflammation. We showed that intravenous administration of SOD during HTV ventilation minimizes deterioration of lung function and significantly reduces associated lung inflammation and oxidative stress.

LTV ventilation decreased serum NO primarily during the first 2 h of ventilation (P < 0.05), whereas HTV ventilation decreased serum NO throughout most of the 5 h of ventilation (P < 0.05, except at 4 h). Notably, SOD administration monotonically increased serum NO level during the course of HTV ventilation is the predominant free radical produced in the biological system, and SOD exerts enzymatic protection against superoxide damage by degrading superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which in turn are converted by GPx-1 into water [84] . Fukai and Ushio-Fukai [79] reported that SODs inhibit superoxide-induced inactivation of iron-sulfur containing enzymes, such as aconitase and fumarase, and reduce the release of iron and subsequent formation for highly toxic hydroxyl radical or related iron-associated reactive species through reacting with H 2 O 2 . SOD has no apparent side effects and has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory capacity against neutrophilic activity, in addition to being an antioxidant [49] . Reitsma et al. [64] reported that negatively charged vascular endothelial glycocalyx tends to bind extracellular SOD and facilitates its protective role. However, as a therapeutic agent, SOD is limited by its relatively large molecular size and a short circulating half-life of 6 min [57] . Nevertheless, exogenous treatment of SOD has been demonstrated protective against hyperoxic lung injury. Mikawa et al. [53] showed that intravenous administration of Cu/Zn SOD markedly reduces hyperoxiainduced pulmonary capillary protein and water leak and decreases tissue oxidative stress and inflammation in rabbit lung. In hyperoxic mice, Yen et al. [87] demonstrated that aerosol administration of Cu/Zn SOD improves survival, reduces lung edema and parenchymal damage, and reduces systemic oxidative stress.",

Though the exact mechanism of SOD-related increasing GPx-1 is unclear, GPx-1 upregulation in response to increased Cu/ Zn SOD has previously been observed in a murine cell line study [12] . Reducing oxidative stress and increasing antioxidant activity reduce RI and improve FEV. On the other hand, adding Cu/Zn SOD may not always reduce lipid peroxidation, and that is associated with the level of iron and catalase [54] . H 2 O 2 derived by Cu/Zn SOD, can cross cellular membrane and form hydroxyl radicals or metal-related reactive species when interacted with redoxactive transitional metal ions, such as iron or Cu, via Fenton reaction that leads to lipid peroxidation and cellular injury [17] .

Ko et al. [35] showed that excessive stretch of lung tissue induces noninfectious lung inflammation through activation of NF-\u03baB-interleukin(IL)-6 signaling pathways. Li et al. [39] reported that HTV ventilation caused significant lung injury in wild-type mice, but fails to induce lung injury in protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) deletion mice, in which NF-kB/MyD88 pathway was interrupted. Chiang et al. [5] showed that anti-NF-\u03baB antibody treatment ameliorates lung injury caused by HTV ventilation combined with lung ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury or by either insult alone, suggesting the pivotal role of NF-\u03baB pathway in lung injury induced by HTV ventilation and/or lung I/R. In autophagy-deficient mouse strains, where NF-\u03baB was inactivated, Lellouche, et al. [44] demonstrated that HTV ventilation did not induce lung inflammation or lung injury. On the other hand, Lin et al. [41] showed that Cu/Zn SOD attenuates the inflammatory response in human epithelial cells through inactivation of NF-\u03baB and activator protein-1, inhibition of JNK and p38 phosphorylation-mediated VCAM expression, and decreasing TNF-\u03b1 induced superoxide productions. Also, Yasui et al. [85] reported that exogenously added Cu/Zn SOD regulates neutrophil apoptosis and reduces the caspase-dependent inflammatory response [56] , and that is mediated by NF-\u03baB [36] .",

NO also involves fibroblast and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [21] , angiogenesis, and neural development [14] . NO is synthesized in pulmonary endothelial cells from L-arginine by NO synthases (NOSs) existing in three isoforms, namely neuronal (nNOS or NOS-1), inducible (iNOS or NOS-2) and endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS-3), where eNOS is the primary NOS isoform expressed in the lung [30] . eNOS can be activated by agonists such as acetylcholine [14] and produces NO in a continuous and lowlevel fashion [73] . As part of the immune defense, iNOS generates NO in large quantities in response to stimuli, including TNF-\u03b1, oxidative stress, cytokines and various pro-inflammatory mediators [59] .

With the presence of ROS, vascular NO is consumed and NO bioavailability is reduced leading to vasoconstriction [51] . Moreover, NO reacts with ROS to form peroxynitrite, which in turn reacts with lipids, DNA and proteins, causing oxidative damages to cells, resulting in cell necrosis or apoptosis [51] . Previously, Jung et al. [31] showed that vascular NO bioavailability is strongly related to the level of extracellular SOD, since SOD scavenges superoxide anions that compete to bind available NO. In rats, Lynch et al. [46] showed that vascular Cu/Zn SOD deficiency, by means of restricting dietary consumption of copper, can impair endothelial vasodilator function through direct inactivation of NO. Besides, Wu et al. [82] showed that iNOS expression requires NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling in microvascular endothelial cells. We showed that intravenous Cu/Zn SOD suppresses iNOS expression in lung, potentially through reducing stimulation by ROS, and steadily increases serum NO concentration during the course of HVT ventilation, supporting increased pulmonary NO bioavailability. We also conducted protein expressions of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated eNOS without finding significant differences among groups.",

Besides, the presence of pulmonary oxidative stress generated during mechanical ventilation can inactivate pulmonary antiproteases and impair surfactant function [62] . Park et al.

            "text": "In addition to reducing alveolar surface tension, SP-A and SP-D play important roles in pulmonary immune responses. SP-A and SP-D, as pattern-recognition molecules of the collectin family of C-type lectins, mediate pulmonary immune defense through enhancing neutrophil uptake of bacteria [22] , and removal of microbes and their debris, pathogens, allergens, dying epithelial cells and phagocytes [80] . Bridges et al. [4] showed that SP-A and SP-D can block low density lipoprotein oxidation and free-radical formation or propagation, so as to serve as potent endogenous inhibitors of lipid peroxidation and oxidative cell damage. Furthermore, Khubchandani and Synder [32] demonstrated that SP-A offsets the inhibitory effects on surfactant function by plasma albumin leaking due to lung injury. Yoshida et al. [89] showed that SP-D reduces alveolar macrophageassociated oxidant production, NF-\u03baB activation, and MMP expression. In mice, Yoshida et al. [89] reported that genetic deficiency of SP-D gene promotes alveolar macrophage infiltration, and increases MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 expressions and hydrogen peroxide formation in lung, causing progressive pulmonary emphysema. In premature newborn lambs, Sato et al. [67] represented that SP-D administration inhibited ventilation-induced lung inflammation. In this study, HTV ventilation was shown to reduce SP-A and SP-D expression in lung, while intravenous Cu/Zn SOD treatment increased both SP-A and SP-D expressions that were associated with improved lung compliance, decreased MMP-9 and NF-\u03baB expression in lung and improved lung function.",
