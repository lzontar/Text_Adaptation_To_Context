Mathematical modeling has become an important tool in analyzing the spread and control of infectious diseases. In implementing measures for preventing the spread of diseases, educating people about the correct preventions of diseases through mass media and other platforms at the first opportunity is particularly important [1] . The coverage of epidemics in the media, such as through television, newspaper, and online networks, gives an overview of the risk level and the relative need for precautions in risk areas and encourages the public to take precautionary measures, such as wearing masks, avoiding public places, and frequent hand washing [2] . Thus, in the past few years, many epidemic models integrating the effects of media coverage have been presented and analyzed [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",
