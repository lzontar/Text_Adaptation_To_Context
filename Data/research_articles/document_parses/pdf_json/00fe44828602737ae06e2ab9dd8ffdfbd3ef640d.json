We here examine how the presence of direct purifying and background 35 selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC 36 and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness 37 effects (DFE) and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter 38 estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background 39 selection effects may result in the mis-inference of population growth under models of both 40 constant population size as well as decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying 41 selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the 42 site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show 43 how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be 44 predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of 45 population growth caused by selection. By treating the DFE as a nuisance parameter and 46 averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites may 47 be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy. 48 49 Keywords: demographic inference, background selection, distribution of fitness effects, MSMC, 50 fastsimcoal2, approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) 51 52 Running title: Demographic inference with selection 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 The characterization of past population size change is a central goal of population genomic 64 analysis -with applications ranging from anthropological to agricultural to clinical (see review 65 by Beichman et al. 2018). Furthermore, use of an appropriate demographic model provides a 66 necessary null model for assessing the impact of selection across the genome (e.g., Teshima et 67 al. 2006; Thornton and Jensen 2007; Jensen et al. 2019). Multiple strategies have been proposed 68 for performing demographic inference, utilizing expectations related to levels of variation, the 69 site frequency spectrum, linkage disequilibrium, and within-and between-population relatedness 70 (e.g., Gutenkunst et al. 2009; Li and Durbin 2011; Lukic and Hey 2012; Harris and Nielsen 71 2013; Excoffier et al. 2013; Bhaskar et al. 2015; Sheehan and Song 2016; Ragsdale and 72 Gutenkunst 2017; Steinr\u00fccken et al. 2019; Kelleher et al. 2019; Speidel et al. 2019). 73 Although many methods perform well when evaluated under the standard assumption of 74 neutrality, it is difficult in practice to assure that the nucleotide sites used in empirical analyses 75 experience neither direct selection nor the effects of selection at linked sites. For example, 76 inference is often performed using intergenic, 4-fold degenerate, or intronic sites. While there is 77 evidence for weak direct selection in all of these categories in multiple organisms (e.g., Haddrill 78 et al. 2005; Chamary and Hurst 2005; Andolfatto 2005; Lynch 2007; Zeng and Charlesworth 79 2010; Choi and Aquadro 2016; Jackson et al. 2017), it is also clear that such sites near or in 80 coding regions will also experience background selection (BGS; Charlesworth et al. 1993; 81 Charlesworth 2013), and may periodically be affected by selective sweeps as well (Messer and 82 Petrov 2013; Schrider et al. 2016). These effects are known to affect the local underlying 83 effective population size, and alter both the levels and patterns of variation and linkage 84 disequilibrium (Charlesworth et al. 1993; Kaiser and Charlesworth 2009; O'Fallon et al. 2010; 85 Charlesworth 2013; Nicolaisen and Desai 2013; Ewing and Jensen 2016; Johri et al. 2020). 86 However, commonly-used approaches for performing demographic inference that assume 87 complete neutrality, including fastsimcoal2 (Excoffier et al. 2013) and MSMC/PSMC (Li and 88 Durbin 2011; Schiffels and Durbin 2014)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": ", have yet to be thoroughly evaluated in the light of this 89 assumption, which is likely to be violated in practice.

Under certain scenarios, this resulted in a many-fold mis-94 inference of population size change. However, the effects of the density of directly selected sites 95 and the shape of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE), which are probably of great 96 importance, have yet to be considered. Spanning the range of these potential parameter values is 97 important for understanding the implications for empirical application. For example, the 98 proportion of the genome experiencing direct purifying selection can vary greatly between 99 species, with estimates ranging from ~3-8% in humans, to ~12% in rice, to 37-53% in D. 100 melanogaster, to 47-68% in S. cerevisiae (Siepel et al. 2005; Liang et al. 2018). Further, many 101 organisms have highly compact genomes, with ~88% of the E. coli genome (Blattner et al. 1997) 102 and effectively all of many virus genomes, being functional (e.g., >95% of the SARS-CoV-2 103 genome, Wu et al. 2020). 104 While such estimates allow us to approximate the effects of BGS in some model 105 organisms, in which recombination and mutation rates are well known, it is difficult to predict 106 these effects in the vast majority of study systems. Moreover, while the genome-wide mean of B, 107 a widely-used measure of BGS effects that measures the level of variability relative to neutral 108 expectation, can range from ~0.45 in D. melanogaster to ~0.94 in humans (Charlesworth 2013; 109 but see Pouyet et al. 2018), existing demographic inference approaches are usually applied 110 across organisms without considering this important source of differences in levels of bias. Here, 111 we examine the effects of the DFE shape and functional density on two common demographic 112 inference approaches -the multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent (MSMC) and 113 fastsimcoal2. Finally, we propose an extension within the approximate Bayesian computation 114 (ABC) framework to address this issue, treating the DFE as a nuisance parameter and 115 demonstrating greatly improved demographic inference even when using directly selected sites 116 alone. 117 118 119 RESULTS and DISCUSSION 120 121 Effects of SNP numbers and genome size on inference under neutral equilibrium 122", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The accuracy and performance of demographic inference was evaluated using two popular 123 methods, MSMC (Schiffels and Durbin 2014) and fastsimcoal2 (Excoffier et al. 2013) .

After a population decline, B was lower than that before the size change; 255 while after population expansion, B increased relative to that in the ancestral population, 256 sometimes approaching 1 (Figure 4 ). This may seem paradoxical, given that the magnitude of the 257 scaled selection coefficient (2Nes) decreases with decreasing Ne (i.e., the efficacy of purifying as described in the Methods section. Although the shape of the SFS is affected by both 293 demography and BGS, the impact of BGS is often comparatively small. Figure 5 shows that the 294 overall shape of the SFS is predicted reasonably well by the analytical results, although 295 deviations are to be expected for the rare allele classes, which are the most sensitive to 296 demographic change and selection. Overall, the results imply that BGS is more likely to bias 297 demographic inference post-decline compared with post-increase, consistent with the 298 performance of the methods described above. However, it should be noted that the exact patterns 299 observed will depend on the timing of population size changes relative to the time of sampling, 300 as well as the value of B before the size change. For example, with a past step increase in is the sole aim, this procedure may be needlessly involved. We thus here examine the possibility 328 of rather treating the DFE as an unknown nuisance parameter, averaging across all possible DFE 329 shapes, in order to assess whether demographic inference may be improved simply by correcting 330 for these selection effects without inferring their underlying parameter values. This approach 331 utilizes functional (i.e., directly selected) regions, a potential advantage in populations for which 332 only coding data may be available (e.g., exome-capture data; see Jones and Good 2016), or more 333 generally in organisms with high gene densities. 334", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 405, "end": 415, "text": "(Figure 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 616, "end": 625, "text": "(Figure 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 949, "end": 957, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Effects of density and inclusion/exclusion of directly selected sites on inference 211"}, {"text": "In order to illustrate this approach, a functional genomic element was simulated under 335 demographic equilibrium, 2-fold exponential population growth and 2-fold exponential 336 population decline with four different DFE shapes (as described previously, and shown in Figure  337 6). A number of summary statistics were calculated (see Methods) for the entire functional 338 region.

These directly selected sites were then used to 348 infer demographic parameters. We found that, by varying the shape of the DFE, averaging across 349 all realizations, and estimating only parameters related to population history, highly accurate 350 inference of modern and ancestral population sizes is possible ( Figure 6 ). These results 351 demonstrate that, even if the true DFE of a population is unknown (as will always be the case in 352 reality), it is possible to infer demographic history with reasonable accuracy by approximately 353 correcting for these selective effects. Generally speaking, the neglect of these effects (i.e., background selection) results in an 366 inference of population growth, with the severity of the growth model roughly scaling with 367 selection strength and density. Thus, when the true underlying model is in fact growth, 368 demographic mis-inference is not particularly severe; when the true underlying model is constant 369 size or decline, the mis-inference can be extreme, with a many-fold underestimation of 370 population size. 371", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 564, "end": 572, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "345"}, {"text": "It is important to note that BGS effects extend to genomic distances in a way that is 372 positively related to the strength of purifying selection. For instance, strongly and moderately 373 deleterious mutations affect patterns of diversity at large genomic distances, whereas mildly 374 deleterious mutations primarily skew allele frequencies at adjacent sites. Thus, if intergenic 375 regions further away from exons are used to perform demographic inference, it is predominantly 376 strongly deleterious mutations that are likely to bias inferences. In contrast, if synonymous sites 377 are used to infer demographic history, mildly deleterious mutations will be most important. Thus, 378 as we here focused on relatively sparsely-coding genomes (resembling human-like gene 379 densities) and used intergenic sites for inference, moderately and strongly deleterious mutations 380 resulted in more severe mis-inference. In addition, the effect of decay of BGS due to mildly 381 deleterious mutations depends on multiple parameters. For instance, with an exon of length 500 382 bp and Drosophila-like parameters (Ne = 10 6 ; recombination rate = mutation rate = 10 -8 / site / 383 generation), B will increase from 0.53 (at 10 bases from the end of the exon) to 0.94 at a distance 384 of 1000 bases.

Thus, mildly deleterious mutations will have drastically different effects in this 387 regard depending on the underlying population parameters.

Note that the y-axes are on different scales, and the magnitude of change observed in the empirical data is considerably larger in the simulated data. Thus, this comparison is only meant to illustrate this common shape taken in MSMC plots (and see similar shapes in, for example, vervets (Warren et al. 2015 ; Figure 4 ) and passenger pigeons (Hung et al. 2014 ; Figure 2) ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 614, "end": 639, "text": "Hill and Robertson (1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1069, "text": "(Thornton 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 2247, "end": 2274, "text": "Schiffels and Durbin (2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2649, "text": "(Warren et al. 2015", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2702, "text": "(Hung et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 76, "end": 83, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1867, "text": "Figure 13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2652, "end": 2660, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2714, "text": "Figure 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "472"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Adaptive evolution of non-coding DNA in Drosophila", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Andolfatto", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "Nature", "volume": "437", "issn": "", "pages": "1149--764", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Thinking too positive? 766 Revisiting current methods of population genetic selection inference", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Bank", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Ewing", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Ferrer-Admettla", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Foll", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Jensen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "Trends Genet", "volume": "767", "issn": "", "pages": "540--546", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Using genomic data to infer historic 769 population dynamics of nonmodel organisms", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Beichman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Huerta-Sanchez", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Lohmueller", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2018, "venue": "Annu.

These results suggest caution when performing inference on smaller regions or 147 genomes, specifically when the number of SNPs are less than ~200,000 per single diploid 148 individual, or less than 1 million per 50 diploid individuals. Extra caution should be used when 149 interpreting population size changes inferred by MSMC when using more than 1 diploid 150 individual. 151 Given this performance, all further analyses were restricted to characterizing 152 demographic inference on data that roughly matched the structure and size of the human genome 153 -for every diploid individual, 22 chromosomes of size 150 Mb each were simulated, which 154 amounted to roughly 3 Gb of total sequence.

These investigations suggest that such 239 demographic inference is robust to genome-wide variation in rates of recombination and 240 mutation, as well as the presence of repeat elements. Thus, serious mis-inference is more likely 241 to be caused by selection. These observations also suggest that simulations performed with mean 242 rates of recombination and mutation, as performed in this study, are sufficient to evaluate of BGS on diversity and the SFS under various demographic models: theoretical 248 expectations versus simulation results 249", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "258 selection decreases, and could thus be expected to result in larger values of B under population 259 decline). Conversely, with increasing Ne, B may be reduced.260However, these expectations apply only once a population has maintained a given Ne for 261 sufficient time such that equilibrium has been approached. During the initial stages of population 262 size change, and shortly afterwards, the dynamics of B tend to show a trend opposite to this long-263 term expectation (see alsoFigure 5ofTorres et al. 2020). This is because differences in Ne264 caused by different initial levels of BGS cause differences in the rates of response to changes in 265 population size -a small value of Ne (corresponding to low B) results in a faster response 266 compared with a high value (Fay and Wu 1999; Hey and Harris 1999; Pool and Nielsen 2007; 267 Pool and Nielsen 2009; Campos et al. 2014; Torres et al. 2020). The relative diversity values 268 observed with different initial equilibrium B values after a short period of population size change 269 may thus be very different from both the initial and final equilibrium values, so that the apparent 270 B values estimated by comparing diversities with and without BGS differ from the equilibrium 271 values. The overall effect is that there is an apparent increase in B immediately following a 272 population decline, and a decrease immediately following an expansion. Analytical models 273 describing these effects are presented in the Appendix. These models used the simulated values 274 of B at equilibrium before the population size changes to predict the apparent B values at the 275 ends of the periods of size change (see the Methods and Appendix). It can be seen from Figure 4 276 that there is good agreement between these predictions and the simulation results. 277 Because several demographic estimation methods are based on fitting a demographic 278 model to the SFS, it is also of interest to understand whether BGS can skew the SFS to different 279 extents under different demographic models. Although it is well known that BGS causes a skew 280 of the SFS towards rare variants under equilibrium models (Charlesworth et al. 1995; Nicolaisen 281 and Desai 2013), the effect of BGS on the SFS with population size change has not been much 282 explored (but see Johri et al. 2020 and Torres et al. 2020). As shown in Figure 5, with a 283 population size decline, the SFS of derived alleles is more skewed towards rare variants when 284 BGS is operating, especially when B is initially small, since the effects of BGS work in 285 opposition to the effects of the population size reduction. This difference in the left skew of the 286 SFS with and without BGS is much less noticeable in the case of population expansion, since 287 here the effects of BGS and the expansion act in a similar direction. 288 As with the estimates of the apparent B values discussed above, analytical predictions of 289 expected SFS after an instantaneous/ exponential change in population size can be made, using 290 the values of B at equilibrium before the population size change (see the Methods), using the 291 formulae of Polanski and Kimmel (2003) and Polanski et al.

The 303 patterns described here thus represent only a small subset of the possibilities. In addition, all else 304 being equal, in populations with large long-term population sizes (and thus low values of B), 305 BGS would be expected to result in even larger biases than those observed here. 306 307 308 A potential solution: averaging across all possible DFEs 309 As shown above, demographic inference can be strongly affected by currently unaccounted for 310 BGS effects, as well as by direct purifying selection. A potential solution is thus to correct for 311 these effects when performing inference of population history. A widely-used approach to 312 estimating direct selection effects, DFE-alpha, takes a stepwise approach to inferring 313 demography, by using a presumed neutral class (synonymous sites); conditional on that 314 demography, it then estimates the parameters of the DFE (Keightley and Eyre-Walker 2007; 315 Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009; Schneider et al. 2011; Keightley and Jackson 2018). However, 316 this approach does not include the possibility of effects of selection at linked sites, which can 317 result an over-estimate of population growth, as well as general mis-inference of the DFE (Johri 318 et al. 2020). 319 Building on this idea, Johri et al. (2020) recently proposed an approach that includes both 320 direct and background effects of purifying selection, simultaneously inferring the deleterious 321 DFE and demography. By utilizing the decay of BGS effects around functional regions, they 322 demonstrated high accuracy under the simple demographic models examined. Moreover, the 323 method makes no assumptions about the neutrality of synonymous sites, and can thus be used to 324 estimate selection acting on these sites, as well as in non-coding functional elements. However, 325 this computationally-intensive approach is specifically concerned with jointly inferring the DFE 326 and demographic parameters. As such, if an unbiased characterization of the population history 327", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "used approaches for inferring demography assume neutrality and independence 358 among segregating sites, it is very difficult to verify those assumptions empirically.

Nonetheless, this neutral performance of 413 MSMC under demographic equilibrium is concerning, and adds to the other previously published 414 cautions concerning the interpretation of MSMC results. For example, Mazet et al. (2016) and 415 Chikhi et al.

For every replicate, 22 chromosomes of 150Mb each were 436 simulated, totaling ~3 Gb of information per individual genome (similar to the amount of 437 information in a human genome). Within each chromosome, 3 different types of regions were 438 simulated, representing non-coding intergenic, intronic, and exonic regions. Based on the NCBI 439 RefSeq human genome annotation, downloaded from the UCSC genome browser for hg19 440 (http://genome.ucsc.edu/; Kent et al. 2002), mean values of exon sizes and intron numbers per 441 gene were calculated. To represent mean values for the human genome (Lander et al. 2001), each 442 gene was comprised of 8 exons and 7 introns, and exon lengths were fixed at 350 bp.

Site frequency spectra (SFS) were obtained for both sets of SNPs for all 10 493 replicates of every combination of demographic history and DFE.

The 500 parameter search ranges for both ancestral and current population sizes in all cases were 501 specified to be uniformly distributed between 100-500000 individuals, while the parameter range 502 for time of change was specified to be uniform between 100-10000 generations in all models. 503 The intensity of the bottleneck, as specified by the population size during the reduction, was also 504 sampled uniformly from the range 100-500000 individuals.

Recombination rates obtained from 520 Yoruban populations were obtained from the UCSC genome browser, while the mutation rate 521 map (https://molgenis26.target.rug.nl/downloads/gonl_public/mutation_rate_map/release2/) was 522 assumed to correspond to estimates obtained from de novo mutations (Francioli et al. 2015), as in 523 Castellano et al. (2020). Absolute values of mutation rates were normalized in order to maintain 524 the mean mutation rate across the genome at ~ 1.0 \u00d7 10 -8 per site per generation. Recombination 525 and mutation rate estimates were taken from positions of approximately 10 Mb to 160 Mb, with 526 the recombination map starting at 10010063 bp and the mutation map starting at 10010001 bp. 527 Regions with missing data for either of the two estimates were simulated with rates 528 corresponding to the previous window, except for the case of centromeres in which no 529 recombination was assumed. In order to understand the effect of excluding centromeric regions 530 in empirical studies, the 4Mb region corresponding to the centromere was masked, 531 corresponding to 48.5 to 52.5 Mb of the simulated 150Mb chromosomes. In order to evaluate the 532 effect of masking repeat regions, random segments comprising 10% of each chromosome were 533 masked. The lengths of these segments were drawn from the lengths of repeat regions found in 534 the human genome (Supp Figure 5), as obtained from the repeat regions in the hg19 assembly of 535 the human genome from the UCSC genome browser. 536 537 Performing inference by approximate Bayesian computation (ABC): ABC was performed 538 using the R package \"abc\" (Csill\u00e9ry et al. 2010), and non-linear regression aided by a neural net 539 (used with default parameters as provided by the package) was used to correct for the 540 relationship between parameters and statistics (Johri et al. 2020). To infer posterior estimates, a 541 tolerance of 0.1 was applied (i.e., 10% of the total number of simulations were accepted by ABC 542 in order to estimate the posterior probability of each parameter). The weighted medians of the 543 posterior estimates for each parameter were used as point estimates. ABC inference was 544 performed under two conditions: (1) complete neutrality, or (2) the presence of direct purifying 545", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF11": {"text": "549 involved in the ABC framework, values of fi were restricted to multiples of 0.05 (i.e., fi \u03f5 {0.0, 550 0.05, 0.10, \u2026, 0.95, 1.0} \u2200 i), which allowed us to sample 1,771 different DFE realizations. 551 Simulations were performed with functional genomic regions, and the demographic model was 552 characterized by 1-epoch changes in which the population either grows or declines exponentially 553 from ancestral to current size, beginning at a fixed time in the past. 554 For the purpose of illustration, and for a contrast with the human-like parameter set 555 above, parameters for ABC testing were selected to resemble those of D. melanogaster African 556 populations.

This work was funded by National Institutes of Health grant 612 R01GM135899 to JDJ. 613 APPENDIX 614 There are two simple scenarios for population size change for which simple explicit expressions for the 615 expected pairwise coalescent time or diversity can be obtained, without using the methodology of 616 Polanski and Kimmel (2003) and Polanski et al. (2003) -a step change in N or an exponential growth 617 in N. First consider the coalescent process for a step change, where the current and initial effective 618 population sizes are denoted by Ne1 and Ne0, respectively. Let B be the background selection parameter 619 at the start of the process of change, corresponding to effective size Ne0. For convenience, time is 620 scaled in units of 2Ne1 generations, and the time of the change in population size on this scale is 621 denoted byT0, counting back from the present time, T = 0. T0 is assumed to be sufficiently small that B 622 remains approximately constant during the period since the change in size. Denote the ratio Ne0/Ne1 by 623 R. The derivation for the case of a step change in population size is similar to that given by Pool and 624 Nielsen (2009) for the purpose of comparing X chromosomes and autosomes. 625 Between times T andT0, coalescence occurs at a rate B -1 on the chosen timescale, so that the 626 contribution from this period to the net coalescent time for a pair of alleles sampled at T = a probability of exp(-B -1 T0) that there is no coalescence when T lies between 0 and T0, 631 after which coalescence occurs at a rate 1/BR, giving a net contribution to the coalescence time ofcoalescence time for the stepwise change with BGS is given by the sum of expression is compared to the corresponding equation with B = 1, the apparent value of B 641 at the time of sampling of the pair of alleles is given by: consider a process of exponential change in population size, starting at an initial effective 646 size of Ne0 at t0 generations in the past and ending at size Ne1, such that the instantaneous growth rate r 647 per generation is r =equal to ln(Ne1/Ne0)/t0. The effective population size at time t in the past is Ne(t) = 648 Ne1exp(-rt); with BGS, the rate of coalescence at time t is 1/BNe(t). As before, the BGS parameter is 649 assumed to remain constant over the period of population size change. It follows that the probability of 650 no coalescence by generation t in the past is-growth period with t > t0 contributes an expected coalescent time of 656 (2 0 + 0 ) ( 0 ), on the scale of generations. 657 Following Slatkin and Hudson (1991), to obtain the contribution from the period with t > 658 t0, it is convenient to measure time as \u03c4 = rt. The probability of coalescence between \u03c4 and \u03c4 + 659 d\u03c4 is then given byfrom this period to the expected coalescent time is given by the integral 664 of \u03c4 Pc(\u03c4) between 0 and \u03c4 0. Following Slatkin and Hudson (1991), by transforming to u = 665 exp(\u03c4), this contribution can be expressed as the following integralcan easily be evaluated numerically. The corresponding mean coalescent 670 time on the scale of generations is obtained by division by r, and the result can be added to 671 (2 0 + 0 ) ( 0 ), yielding the net expected coalescent time. By dividing the resulting 672 expression by the corresponding expression with B = 1, the apparent BGS effect at the time of 673 sampling can be obtained, in the same way as for the step change modelProportion ( ) of mutations in each class of the discrete distribution of fitness Inference of demography by MSMC (red lines; 10 replicates) and fastsimcoal2 (blue 684 lines; 10 replicates) with and without BGS, under demographic equilibrium (left column), 30-685 fold exponential growth (middle column), and ~6-fold instantaneous decline (right column).
