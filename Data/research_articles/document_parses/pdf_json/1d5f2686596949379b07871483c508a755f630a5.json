To this end, the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by the binding of the viral Spike (S) protein to human ACE2, has emerged as an attractive drug repurposing target. Here we use murine leukemia viruses pseudotyped with Spike from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 to demonstrate that ACE2-mediated coronavirus entry can be mitigated by heparin, a heparan sulfate-related glycan, or by genetic ablation of biosynthetic enzymes for the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). A drug repurposing screen targeting HSPG-dependent endocytosis identifies pharmacologically active endocytosis inhibitors that also abrogate coronavirus cell entry. Among them,",

This severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (1, 2), which is closely related to SARS-CoV, the virus underlying the 2003 SARS outbreak (3) . As a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus bearing a membrane envelope, coronavirus enters cells when this membrane envelope fuses with host membranes (4) . Previous studies showed that the entry of SARS-CoV is primarily mediated by ACE2-dependent endocytosis (5, 6) , and new evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may follow the same entry path (1, 7). Specifically, limiting the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) inhibits the fusion of the SARS-CoV-2 envelop with the endolysosomes and subsequent viral entry (8, 9) . Additionally, entry-associated membrane fusion requires several host proteases, including the lysosome-localized Cathepsin B/L and TMPRSS2 (10) (11) (12) . The fact that increasing the lysosomal pH in either TMPRSS2 positive Caco-2 or TMPRSS2 negative HEK293 cells both significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cell entry (10) also suggests the endolysosome as a major entry site for SARS-CoV-2.",

Strikingly, this mechanism can be coopted by certain viruses and pathogens to establish productive infection (13, 14) . To identify drugs that can diminish the spreading of misfolded a-Syn and the associated Parkinsonism (15), we screened and found eight FDA-approved drugs that block the endocytosis of preformed a-Syn fibrils (see below). Intriguingly, one of the candidates Tilorone, was recently reported as an inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 infection (16) . This coincidence, together with reports that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike can interact with heparin (17, 18) and that treating cells with heparinase or heparin inhibits SARS-CoV cell entry (19) prompted us to investigate the possibility of targeting HSPGdependent endocytosis as a COVID-19 therapeutic strategy.",

As expected, this phenotype was only seen at low doses due to the intrinsic cytotoxicity of the drugs at high doses.

Importantly, compared to Mitoxantrone, Banoxantrone failed to interact with cell membranes ( Figure 3E ), and coincidentally, it was much weaker to reduce SARS-CoV-2 PP entry into host cells ( Figure 3F) . Surprisingly, while several weaker inhibitors but not Mitoxantrone could rescued the CPE of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells ( Figure 2G , H, Fig. S4 ), which might be due to the relatively high cytotoxicity of Mitoxantrone. In this regard, it is compelling to see that the dose-dependent toxicity profiles of Mitoxantrone and Banoxantrone were indistinguishable ( Figure 3G ). The uncoupling of the antiviral and the anti-cancer activities of Mitoxantrone suggests the possibility of generating similar antiviral compounds with reduced cytotoxicity.",

We therefore determined whether the newly identified drugs affect the actin network using U2OS cells stably expressing Tractin-EGFP, an actin filament label (28). Confocal microscopy showed that most drugs did not change the actin network except for Sunitinib, an anti-cancer agent, and BNTX, an opioid receptor antagonist ( Figure 4A, Fig. S6A ). In untreated cells, actin monomers polymerize near peripheral membranes, forming a microfilament network with many parallel actin filaments ( Fig. S6A ). Additionally, a meshwork of actin is associated with the cell cortex, and thick actin bundles named stress fibers are often found near basal membranes. In cells exposed to Sunitinib, the actin microfilaments were frequently replaced by short disoriented actin segments. Many cells also contained an increased number of filopodia. By contrast, cells treated with BNTX had significantly reduced actin filaments, and many cells contained actin-bearing aggregates. These Together, these data suggest that Sunitinib promotes actin assembly to form disoriented filaments, while BNTX disrupts the cortex actin meshwork either by promoting actin disassembly or inhibiting actin assembly. The fact that two structurally unrelated actin inhibitors both block coronavirus entry strongly suggests that the endocytosis of coronavirus requires the actin cytoskeleton. Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 cell entry was also sensitive to Latrunculin A, a wellestablished actin inhibitor ( Figure 4F ). These findings, together with the fact that a previous drug screen identified Sunitinib as an entry inhibitor for Ebola virus (29), suggest that the actin network may paly a previously unappreciated role in the entry of many viruses into host cells.",

We treated HEK293T cells with these drugs for 6 h at a dose that imposed a significant inhibition on viral entry. Differential gene expression analyses showed that Mitoxantrone had the most significant impact on gene expression ( Figure 5A ), consistent with its relatively high cytotoxicity. By contrast, Tilorone had the smallest effect, altering only a limited number of genes with small changes (Fig. S7A-D) . Cluster analysis showed that the gene expression signature associated with Raloxifene treatment was more similar to that of Piceatannoltreated cells than to Tilorone-or Mitoxantrone-treated cells ( Figure 5A ), suggesting that Tilorone uses a mechanism distinct from the other drugs, therefore, raising the possibility of combining Tirolone with other drugs to achieve stronger inhibition of viral entry. Indeed, in our initial trial, while Tilorone by itself required high doses to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PP entry, co-treatment with Sunitinib, BNTX, Raloxifene, or Piceatannol all significantly enhanced the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PP entry by Tilorone, while Mitoxantrone modestly increased Tilorone's activity ( Figure  5B -F).

These proteins all bear negative charge-enriched heparan sulfate polymers that can promote the interaction of cells with a variety of endocytic ligands including viruses and pathogens (14) . Our data suggest that HSPGs help to recruit SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface, which should increase its local concentration for effectively engaging ACE2. Additionally, HSPGs might have a role downstream of viral recruitment given the observed binding of heparin to Spike, which induces a conformational change in the latter (17) .

Instead, the demonstration of Tilorone as an endocytosis inhibitor offers an alternative explanation for its antiviral function. Importantly, our study also suggests that Tilorone, when combined with other endocytosis inhibitors can generate a promising anti-viral synergism.

Experiments shown in Figure 2C (Promega) was added to assay plates and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The luminescence signal was measured by a Victor 1420 plate reader (PerkinElmer). For ACE2-GFP cells, the GFP signal was also determined by the plate reader. Data were normalized with wells containing PPs but no compound as 100%, and wells mock-treated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) as 0%, and the ratio of luciferase to the corresponding GFP intensity was calculated. We noticed that the drug potency measured in the ACE2-expressing cells by the 96-well format is ~6-10-fold higher than that from the 1,536 formats, which is probably due to the longer incubation required for the 1,536 formats. Under this condition, the drugs might lose activities due to cell metabolism or decomposing. The difference in the cell lines may also contribute to the discrepancy.",
