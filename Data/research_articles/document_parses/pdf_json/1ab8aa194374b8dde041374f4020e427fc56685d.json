The rule of the epidemic spreading as an important issue has been quite extensively studied for many years, but has not been mastered well. The epidemic spreads by the interaction between people, and complex networks, whose nodes represent individuals or organizations and link the interactions among them, can characterize this interpersonal interaction perfectly. In order to conveniently study the epidemic spreading, researchers usually adopt the homogeneous network structure and the homogeneous mixing hypotheses. Recently, researchers began to discuss the credibility of the homogeneous network structure hypothesis and consider the inhomogeneity of the network structure. However, the credibility of the homogeneous mixing hypothesis has not been well discussed until now. In this paper, we try to discuss this credibility and carry out numerical simulations on an epidemic spreading model. The results show that the epidemic spreading is inhomogeneous whether the individuals are stationary or moving. However, the inhomogeneity decreases with the increase of individuals' speed, and almost disappears when the speed is high enough.",

Here each node in the network represents an individual, and each link represents a connection along which the epidemic can spread. A susceptible individual can be infected by its infected neighbors with some probability, and the infected individual can become susceptible with other probability. As the infected individuals always infect their neighbors, we predict that the spreading of the epidemic may actually be inhomogeneous. That is, the probabilities of infected individuals connecting with susceptible ones differ significantly. To investigate the inhomogeneity, we perform large scale numerical simulations on static and dynamic networks. In these simulations, we study two spreading modes of the SIS model. In one mode, the probability that a susceptible individual is infected is unrelated to the number of its infected neighbors. In another mode, the probability increases with the number.",

When the infection den- sity H = N H / L 2 is not quite large, the distribution of the infected cluster size in homogeneous mode is similar to the distribution of the cluster size of the site percolation. 20 That is, there exists a c .

In reality, the infected clusters whose sizes are larger than c barely exist, so the infected cluster with the critical infected cluster size c is regarded as the largest infected cluster that can be observed, and c is denoted as the CICS. With the increase of H , a critical infection density c emerges, above which it is possible that all the individuals gather into one cluster. Our experiments show that c is about 1.4. As shown in Fig. 1 , the maximum number of infected individuals is about 50, that is, the maximum infection density is about 1 \u035150/ 7 2 \u0352. In such cases, N H infected individuals always gather into more than one cluster. Then we can characterize the homogeneity of their distribution with the CICS.

In fact, the epidemic always spreads near the infected individuals, that is, the infected individuals only infect their susceptible neighbors, and thus it is a natural thing for epidemic to spread inhomogeneously when the infection density is not so large.

Concretely, when v = 0.2, 1 \u0351 2 \u0352 is close to that of the static network \u0351v =0\u0352. With increasing of v, 1 \u0351 2 \u0352 decreases evidently and moves toward H \u0351homogeneous mode\u0352 progressively. This means that the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading becomes smaller with increasing speed v. Generally speaking, it is easier to maintain a structure in the static environment. Interestingly, our simulation results indicate that when the individuals walk randomly and the speed is not very high, their distribution is inhomogeneous. That is, the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading is kept in the dynamic environment.",

The simulations in the static and dynamic networks show that the infected individuals are usually prone to gather into large clusters as the infected individuals always infect their neighbors. For such a reason, the epidemic usually spreads inhomogeneously. Even in dynamic networks, the inhomogeneity can be kept well. And, the smaller the infection density, the more inhomogeneously the epidemic spreads. However, the inhomogeneity decreases with the increase of the individuals' speed in the dynamic networks, and the epidemic spreading becomes almost homogeneous when the speed is large enough.",
