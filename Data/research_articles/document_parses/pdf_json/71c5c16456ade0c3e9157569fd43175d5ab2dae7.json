None of these patients had any significant cardiac history or coronary risk factors except a history of hypertension in 2 (8%). A comprehensive CMR evaluation was performed on a 3T scanner including conventional techniques of cine, late gadolinium enhanced imaging (LGE) and T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging, as well as parametric mapping of myocardial T1, T2, and extracellular volume (ECV).",

None of these patients appeared to have developed symptoms and signs of cardiac failure during their initial treatment to COVID-19 pneumonia. The median time between onset of cardiac symptoms and CMR was 47 days. Only 13 of the 26 patients had hs-cTnI measured during their COVID-19 hospitalization, and all had a normal hs-cTnI at the time of CMR. 14 (54%) of patients had evidence of increased T2 signal ratio by STIR imaging and 31% of cases had evidence of small focal subepicardial and patchy mid-wall LGE in a pattern consistent with myocarditis. Abnormal T2 STIR and LGE were noted to involve 33% and 4% of segments, respectively suggesting significant myocardial edema with minimal scarring. Only one patient, who had positive conventional CMR findings based on T2 STIR and LGE, had an abnormal EF with evidence of a regional wall motion abnormality in the segments with myocardial edema. While the mean LV function was similar among controls and subjects with and without conventional CMR abnormalities, the cohort with conventional CMR findings had reduced RV function as compared to healthy controls. When divided into two groups based on the presence of conventional CMR findings, the group with positive CMR findings had increases in global T1, T2, and ECV compared to those without conventional CMR findings and normal controls. Notably, in the 8 LGE positive patients, the remote myocardium had evidence of increased T1, T2, and ECV as compared to healthy control subjects. These findings suggest presence of mild edema based on the modest magnitude of increase in T1, T2, and ECV respectively (1271 vs 1224 msec, 43 vs 39 msec, and 28.2 vs 23.7%).",

Specifically, there appears to be evidence of diffuse myocardial edema based on T2 STIR imaging disproportionate to the small LGE extent, in an absence of LV dysfunction, which begs the question of whether there is direct viral infection or whether cardiac involvement is primarily due to inflammation. These intriguing questions will need to be studied further in larger studies. The current study has a number of limitations. The retrospectively design of the study does not enable assessment of the prevalence of CMR findings in patients that have recovered from acute COVID-19 infections. Secondly the cohort of patients is small, however, this likely reflects the reduction of advanced cardiovascular imaging utilization and resources in a region within the early parts of the epidemic. Larger studies looking at persistent cardiac involvement in COVID-19 will likely follow as advanced cardiovascular imaging services resume more broadly. Interestingly the patients demonstrated evidence of myocardial edema despite absence of hs-TnI positivity, and unfortunately only half of the patients had troponin assessment during their hospitalization.",

There has been particular interest in IL-6, and inhibitors of inflammation could potentially be therapies for COVID-19 myocarditis. As multiple pathologies including acute myocardial infarction, takutsubo cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis are all within the differential diagnosis of a positive troponin, chest pain, and heart failure in COVID-19 patients, a rapid CMR protocol could potentially be used to differentiate between these etiologies. However, performing CMR in these patients necessitates the balance between patient benefit and the need to protecting staff and critical resources.",
