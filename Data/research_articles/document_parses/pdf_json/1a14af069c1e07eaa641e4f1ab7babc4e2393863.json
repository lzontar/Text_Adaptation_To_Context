This becomes even more important during a pandemic such as the one we are all currently experiencing.",

This significant reduction was ascribed to the fact that 'the new cleaning methods and product met with widespread acceptance from cleaning staff, who found the new product and its formulation as a wipe cloth very user friendly. This acceptance by cleaning staff may well have influenced the thoroughness of cleaning and been responsible for the significant decline in VRE contamination both before and after disinfection' [3] .",
