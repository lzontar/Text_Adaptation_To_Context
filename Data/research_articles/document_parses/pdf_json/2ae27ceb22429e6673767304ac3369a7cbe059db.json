Under steady states of both CO 2 production and oxygen consumption, the gapCO 2 was observed to be increased in parallel with the reduction in cardiac output [9] . However, spontaneous breathing and hyperventilation may reduce the partial pressure of CO 2 in arteries (PaCO 2 ) and prevent the CO 2 stagnation-induced rise in central venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO 2 ). Mallat et al. demonstrated that acute hyperventilation provoked a significant increase in gapCO 2 and oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) [10] . To date, little is known about the gapCO 2 and respiratory rate (RR) in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the underlying effect of the RR on the gapCO 2 in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation.",

At present, the gapCO 2 has been considered an evaluation of tissue hypoperfusion and has been recommended as a guide for resuscitation in septic patients [5, 6] . However, it is unknown whether the clinical significance of the gapCO 2 also applies to septic patients with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we explored the effects of the respiratory rate on the gapCO 2 in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation and found a significant difference in the gapCO 2 induced by hyperventilation. When the respiratory rates increased with the tidal volume unchanged, the total minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation, as well as the PaO 2 , improved. The PaCO 2 decreased because excessive ventilation enabled the increased expiration of CO 2 . Our results showed that the PcvCO 2 and PaCO 2 decreased with an increasing respiratory rate, and this difference was statistically significant. However, the decreasing trend of the PaCO 2 was more obvious than that of the PcvCO 2 . Consequently, the difference in the gapCO 2 values when the RR varied from 10 to 16 breaths/min was significant. We consider that the following physiological factors can explain this phenomenon.",

            "text": "The combination of oxygen and hemoglobin can promote the release of CO 2 . Furthermore, CO 2 more easily combines with hemoglobin at lower oxygen saturation, which is a phenomenon called the Haldane effect [15] . Clearly an increase in alveolar ventilation increases CO 2 excretion and alveolar PaO 2 . Increased alveolar ventilation causes respiratory alkalosis with immediate changes in hydrogen ion concentrations and bicarbonate concentrations. There are transcellular shifts with H ions coming out cells into the plasma and shifts of potassium from the plasma into cells. Renal compensation with bicarbonate excretion takes hours. Nevertheless, respiratory alkalosis can cause peripheral vasoconstriction and decreased flow through the various vascular beds. This is probably not a uniform effect in all vessels and may or may not occur in patients with sepsis. However, if blood flow decreases but metabolism is unchanged, then the CO 2 content of venous blood should increase, leading to a higher gapCO 2 . If patients with sepsis have disordered cellular metabolism, then the production CO 2 may decrease, which in turn results in a lower gapCO 2 . Furthermore, the depression of oxidative adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production also led to pulmonary vasoconstriction [16] . Nitric oxide synthesis defect has shown to be another cause [17] . As a consequence, the reducing trend of the CO 2 partial pressure of venous blood is less marked than that of arterial blood. This has been demonstrated by other scholars as well [18] . The increase in alveolar ventilation increases CO 2 excretion and should increase the alveolar PaO 2 provided other factors stay the same. Increased alveolar ventilation causes respiratory alkalosis with immediate changes in hydrogen ion concentrations and bicarbonate concentrations. There should be transcellular shifts with hydrogen ion coming out cells into the plasma and shifts of potassium from the plasma into cells. Respiratory alkalosis can cause peripheral vasoconstriction and decreased flow through various vascular beds. This is probably not a uniform effect in all vessels and may or may not occur in patients with sepsis. However, if blood flow decreases but metabolism is unchanged, then the CO 2 content of venous blood should increase, resulting in a gapCO 2 . If patients with sepsis have dysfunctional cellular metabolism, then the production CO 2 may decrease, which would result in a lower gapCO 2 . This likely varies in the vascular bed from tissue to tissue. CO 2 binding hemoglobin may not have an important effect in these experiments.",

            "text": "When vasoconstriction is caused by hypocapnia, poor oxygen delivery may add tissue oxygen extraction [19] . Hence, when patients are in hypocapnia provoked by hyperventilation, the CO 2 partial pressure of the venous blood does not obviously decrease compared with the CO 2 partial pressure of the arterial blood. For instance, Khambatta et al. reported that mechanically ventilated dogs undergoing 2 h of hyperventilation had 20% CO 2 production and 25% O 2 consumption [20] . In this study, the S cv O 2 significantly increased with the RR increase from 10 to 14 breaths/min, but there was no significant decreasing trend in S cv O 2 between 14 and 16 breaths/min, which was consistent with a previous report [21] . Moreover, it is widely accepted that the gapCO 2 depends on measurements from the superior vena cava (SVC) but does not reflect measurements from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and tissues draining into the IVC [22] . Patients with septic shock lack an effective circulating blood volume, which leads to systemic anoxia and metabolic acidosis. Acidosis and excess CO 2 can cause mitochondrial dysfunction [23, 24] . Metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis due to excessive hyperventilation further reduce the function of mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation, which may impact CO 2 production. In summary, our data suggested that in septic patients with mechanical ventilation, respiratory alkalosis induced by hyperventilation enabled the increase of gapCO 2 . Clinicians should be cautious when interpreting the gapCO 2 as low cardiac output and inadequate perfusion in hemodynamically stable ventilated septic shock patients.",
