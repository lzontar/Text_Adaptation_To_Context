It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) [2] [3] [4] . A number of interventions have been proposed in the past decade; however, few of them obtained strong recommendation [5, 6] . Only lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy has been proven beneficial for prognosis of these patients [5, 7] . Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) may be a useful therapeutic strategy in patients with ARDS [8] . The ARDS et Curarisation Systematique (ACURASYS) trial conducted in 2010 found early administration of a 48-h infusion of NMBA was associated with a lower risk of death in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS [9] . It is important to realize that patients in the control group in this study received deep sedation, and this is inconsistent with the current guidelines [10, 11] . A meta-analysis including 5 studies systematically reviewed the effects of NMBAs on ARDS. They concluded the application of NMBAs could reduce the mortality of patients with moderateto-severe ARDS [12] . However, the results of this metaanalysis are mainly affected by the ACURASYS trial [9] . Based on the limited evidence and potential adverse events, NMBAs is only weakly recommended in the current guidelines [13] [14] [15] . A new multi-center randomized control study (Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade [ROSE] trial) just published recently [16] .

Such as decrease the oxygen consumption of respiratory and other muscles, reducing cardiac output, increasing the mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen, and increasing the partial pressure of arterial oxygen. By paralyzing respiratory muscles, neuromuscular blocking agents may indirectly minimize various manifestations of ventilator-induced lung injury [23] . The most used NMBAs in patients with ARDS is cisatracurium. Comparison with cisatracurium, vecuronium has different pharmacological properties [24] . Lyu [20] evaluated the effects of vecuronium in patients with moderate or severe ARDS and they found vecuronium is associated with better prognosis. However, low methodological quality may bias their results, and they did not compare the different effects between cisatracurium and vecuronium. Sottile et al. [25] compared the effects of cisatracurium with vecuronium in patients with or at risk for ARDS. They found there was no difference of mortality and hospital length of stay between two groups. Nevertheless, patients in the cisatracurium group experienced a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. This may be because the metabolism and elimination of cisatracurium is independent of organ function and vecuronium is associated with a higher risk of ICU-acquired weakness [8] . In a United States national survey, 94% of respondents used either bolus or infusion neuromuscular blockade in patients with ARDS and 62.1% of respondents used NMBAs as tier 1 rescue strategy [26] .

Our meta-analysis updated the results with the latest ROSE trial [16] , which included more patients than all previous published studies. However, our results are different from the results of the previous meta-analysis. There are several possible explanations for this result. The most important factor may be the difference in sedation levels. Patients in the control group received light sedation according to the current guidelines [10, 11, 29, 30] , in the ROSE trial, however, those patients received deep sedation in other previous published studies. It has been reported that deep sedation use in critically ill patients is independently associated with delayed extubation and increased mortality [31] . Moreover, Akoumianaki et al. [32] proposed a new mechanism for ventilator dyssynchrony in patients with ARDS in 2013, called reverse triggering. And deep sedation level may increase the incidence of reverse triggering, and the latter is associated with poor prognosis in patients with ARDS [33] .

Additionally, NMBAs related complications has also been a focus of concern, especially the ICU-obtained weakness [15] . In the present study, we did not find shortterm use of NMBAs could increase the incidence of ICU-obtained weakness. However, the diagnosis of ICU-obtained weakness is inconsistent and subjective and many other factors can affect the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness [34, 35] .

Severe ARDS patients with patient-ventilator dyssynchronies, or who are vulnerable to ventilator-induced injury may benefit from NMBAs use. Thus, we think NMBAs could be used for improvement of oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS. Additionally, further studies should focus on the following major topics. Firstly, in recent years, different subgroups or phenotypes of ARDS have been pay attention to [37] . Patients who are response to NMBAs therapy should be identified in further studies. Then, the optimal dose, time and duration of NMBAs remain unclear. The ACURASYS [9] and ROSE [16] studies used high dosages of cisatracurium (37.5 mg/h). Clinical assessment should be used in combination with Train-of-four (TOF) to titrate the optimal NMBAs' dose [15] .
