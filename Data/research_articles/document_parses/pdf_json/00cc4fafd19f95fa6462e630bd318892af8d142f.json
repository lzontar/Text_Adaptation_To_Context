New world alphaviruses commonly are associated with encephalitic disease in humans while infections with old world alphaviruses usually are associated with fever, rash and arthritis (Griffin, 2007) . Following infection, the non-structural viral proteins (nsP1-4) of alphaviruses are translated directly from an open reading frame at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome while the structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K, E1) are derived from a 26S sub-genomic RNA produced by newly synthetised non-structural proteins (Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . While the roles of non-structural proteins nsP1, 2 and 4 are well understood that of nsP3 is less clear. Furthermore, while alphavirus nsP1, 2 and 4 proteins share extensive sequence homology with proteins from other families of positive strand viruses, nsP3 does not (Ahlquist et al., 1985; Haseloff et al., 1984) . nsP3 contains two conserved domains. The first (X or macro domain) is conserved among alphaviruses, coronaviruses, rubella and hepatitis E viruses (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) and the second is conserved among alphaviruses (Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . nsP3 is highly phosphorylated, particularly the serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal region (Vihinen and Saarinen, 2000) and may act to attach the alphavirus replication complex (nsP1-4 proteins) to the cytoskeleton of the host cell (Frolova et al., 2006; Gorchakov et al., 2008) . Semliki Forest viruses (SFV) can tolerate deletions of from 43 to 119 amino acids in the C-terminal region of their nsP3 proteins with only slight reductions in replication efficiency in vitro and in virulence for mice (Galbraith et al., 2006) and a 102 nucleotide deletion in this region of the nsP3 gene of Venezuelan encephalitis virus (VEEV) had no detectable effect on replication in vitro (Davis et al., 1989) . Several members of the alphavirus family have an OPAL stop codon near the 3\u2032 end of the nsP3 gene (Strauss et al., 1988) requiring read-through for production of the nsP4 polymerase. Duplicated amino acid elements have been observed in the C-terminal region of nsP3 of several alphavirus isolates (Meissner et al., 1999; Oberste et al., 1996; Strauss et al., 1988) but without any indication of when or where these events occurred and whether they were related to the epidemiology of the viruses concerned.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 171, "text": "(Koonin and Dolja, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 356, "end": 371, "text": "(Griffin, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 682, "end": 709, "text": "(Strauss and Strauss, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 980, "end": 1003, "text": "(Ahlquist et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1026, "text": "Haseloff et al., 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1200, "text": "(Koonin and Dolja, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1275, "text": "(Strauss and Strauss, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1409, "text": "(Vihinen and Saarinen, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1544, "text": "(Frolova et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1568, "text": "Gorchakov et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1814, "text": "(Galbraith et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1986, "text": "(Davis et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2087, "end": 2109, "text": "(Strauss et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2286, "end": 2309, "text": "(Meissner et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2331, "text": "Oberste et al., 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2353, "text": "Strauss et al., 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Ross River virus (RRV) employs complex, overlapping, urban and rural cycles of transmission involving multiple mosquito and vertebrate hosts but causes disease only in humans and horses (Russell, 2002) .

The C-terminal region of the nsP3 protein of RRV (amino acids 301-550) contained three additional elements that appeared to have been duplicated and one, P*P*PR, that appeared at four locations ( Fig. 1A) . Other elements contained fewer amino acids than the HADTVSLDSTVS one and the amino acid sequences were less conserved. Within the HADTVSLDSTVS/L element, there were three tri-peptides (TVS) which were not found elsewhere in the nsP3 protein of RRV suggesting they may have been the foot prints of previous duplication events in this region.

The number of cases of RRV infection reported in Australia has climbed steadily from approximately 500 cases in 1980 to an average of approximately 5000 per year at present (Aaskov, 2009 ). Accompanying this increase in the number of cases in Australia has been the steady replacement of lineage 1 and 2 RRV by lineage 3 viruses (Jones et al., 2010) . While there had been outbreaks of RRV infection in Australia prior to that in the Pacific, almost certainly caused by strains of RRV without this duplicated element in the nsP3 gene, these involved scores rather than tens of thousands of cases (Aaskov, 2009 ). However, we have been unable to identify a mechanism by which this change in the nsP3 gene could have conferred a significant fitness advantage on populations of RRV and it remains possible that one, or several, of the single nucleotide polymorphisms that distinguish the current lineage of RRV from the previous two (Jones et al., 2010) were responsible for these lineage replacements. There are precedents with other alphaviruses for epidemic potential to be determined by changes in only one or two nucleotides (Anischenko et al., 2006; Tsetsarkin et al., 2009) . The task of evaluating the significance of the duplication of this element is made more difficult by the absence of RRV isolates from Epidemic Polyarthritis patients in Australia prior to 1983 (Aaskov et al., 1985) and the extensive passage of early lineages of RRV from pools of mosquitoes (which may have contained multiple infected insects) in the brains of suckling mice in order to recover isolates.

Duplication of the sequence 5\u2032 to its position in the RRV T48 genome would require changes to three nucleotides in the insert.

However, given the additional energy required to unfold more stable RNA structures prior to translation or copying, it is difficult to imagine such changes would confer any fitness advantage. The element HADTVSLDSTVS/L differed from two of the others (PVPPPR and VEFPWAPEDL) which also appeared to have been duplicated in RRV in that it was not strongly hydrophobic. Even when variation occurred in the sequence of the two latter elements, the amino acid replacements usually were hydrophobic (Table 1) .

Examples of duplicated elements, similar to those observed in RRV, but unique to particular families or lineages of alphaviruses are highlighted in Fig. 3 . A full comparison of this region of the nsP3 protein of the major families of alphaviruses and the corresponding nucleotide sequences are shown elsewhere (Fig. S2) In both EEEV and VEEV, the duplicated element appeared 5\u2032 to the original suggesting that the same may have occurred with the recently duplicated element in RRV nsP3. In contrast to RRV, the nsP3 genes of many other families of alphaviruses appeared to contain foreign genetic material. For example, there appeared to have been insertions of non-CHIKV RNA at two sites in the nsP3 gene of that virus. The amino acid element STITSLTHSQFDLSVDGE in CHIKV 06-021 was found in most strains of CHIKV but not in an example of one of the earliest lineages, ALSA 1. The amino acid sequence STITSLTH was identical to a region of a putative zinc finger protein from Aedes aegypti (Genbank XM001660684.1). The element GIADLAA in SFV (Y12518) was found nowhere else in the SFV polyprotein but appeared in a wide range of cellular proteins suggesting that host cell RNA could been inserted into this region of the SFV genome. Examples of what may represent foreign RNA inserted into the nsP3 genes of other alphaviruses have been reported previously (Davis et al., 1989 , Oberste et al., 1996 , Meissner et al., 1999 or are highlighted in EEV, SINV and VEEV in Fig. 3 . In EEEV and SINV there appeared to be hotspots for insertion events with progressively larger elements being inserted at the same site of different lineages. As some repeats, e.g. P*P*PR, were observed in most lineages of alphaviruses (Powers et al., 2001) , it is likely that the processes giving rise to them have been occurring for centuries. However, apart from two short ALAAR elements in an A-rich region, no repeat elements could be detected in the p150 gene/protein of rubella virus which has been suggested to be an antecedent of the alphavirus nsP3 gene (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1483, "end": 1502, "text": "(Davis et al., 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1525, "text": ", Oberste et al., 1996", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1549, "text": ", Meissner et al., 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1859, "text": "(Powers et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2191, "text": "(Koonin and Dolja, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 280, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 437, "end": 446, "text": "(Fig. S2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1600, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "T V S H A D T V S L D S T V S T48"}, {"text": "The recent suggestion by Arrigo et al. (2010) that North American and South American lineages of EEV be reclassified as different species in the EEE complex is supported by an analysis of the amino acid sequences of the hypervariable region of their nsP3 proteins (Fig. 3) . The EAEV/IH element is not duplicated in the North American lineage and this lineage appears to contain two, and possibly three, large insertions. Using similar criteria, there may be a case for making lineage 1E strains of VEEV a separate species in the VEE complex i.e. a large amino acid element is duplicated in VEEV lineages 1AB, 1C and 1D but not in 1E and lineage 1E viruses contain three large sequences not found in the other lineages of VEEV. The changes observed in the C-terminal region of the nsP3 gene/ protein of RRV and other alphaviruses bore some similarities to those in defective interfering (D.I.) particles of SINV and SFV i.e. linear repeats and the insertion of foreign nucleotide sequences (Lehtovaara et al., 1981; Tsiang et al., 1985) raising the possibility that the processes giving rise to the hypervariability in nsP3 genes are similar to those that give rise to alphavirus DI particles. These observations and earlier studies (Davis et al., 1989 , Lehtovaara et al., 1981 Tsiang et al., 1985) suggest that the hypervariability of the nsP3 gene and the generation of alphavirus DI particles both could be due to recombination as a result of RNA template switching by nsP4. The duplication events in EEEV, VEEV and possibly RRV occurred 5\u2032 to the original element, suggesting that recombination could have occurred during synthesis of negative strand RNA. Perhaps nsP4 is more prone to template switching when it is associated with the uncleaved nsP1-3 polyprotein to synthetise negative strand RNA than when it is complexed with nsP1, nsP2 and nsP3 proteins to produce positive strand RNA.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 25, "end": 45, "text": "Arrigo et al.
