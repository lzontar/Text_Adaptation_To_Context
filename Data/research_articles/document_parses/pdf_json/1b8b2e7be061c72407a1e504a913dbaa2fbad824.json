All these reports provide early evidence suggesting that HCWs, in addition to having an increased risk for developing anxiety, depression, insomnia, or post-traumatic stress disorder, could also have a heightened likelihood of experiencing transient stress-related psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, middle-aged women working in the frontline against COVID-19 seem to be more prone to developing them (Table) .",

Along this line, although within the psychosis spectrum, brief stress-related psychoses are self-limited syndromes with a generally good prognosis, they are also associated with a high risk of suicidal behaviour, high relapse rate, and increased risk of developing severe mental disorders in the long-term [8][9][10]. Therefore, in light of these concerns, we advocate preventive intervention and psychological support initiatives, such as the Covid-Psy Hotline [7] , aimed at reducing the burden and distress of the healthcare staff during the pandemic. We further recommend active screening for psychotic symptoms in HCWs, particularly among those professionals in the frontline against COVID-19. Lastly, we emphasize the need for close monitoring and prolonged follow-up of any HCW who has a short-lived psychotic disorder to avoid relapses and unfavourable outcomes.",
