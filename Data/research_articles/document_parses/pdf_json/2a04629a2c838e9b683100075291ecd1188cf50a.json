Additionally, specific regulations were issued conditioning all in-person clinic visits by a preliminary phone or on-line triage determining if the visit is necessary.

Sadly, doctors who choose to stay in the front line may fear for their own health or the health of other patients in their medical facility if they feel appropriate protection measures are not available to them, and suitable isolation of suspected patients may not take place in community clinics. In the first case described above, it seems the doctor was frightened and reprimanded the patient and her mother for coming to the clinic when the child was displaying what she referred to as viral symptoms. Consequently, an incomplete examination took place, leading to a missed appendicitis.

Doctors have been instructed to contact patients by phone and to switch to a more telemedicinebased practice (e.g. voice and video input as well as different appliances that are used today in order to assist in the implementation of remote physical examination) in order to minimize risk for their patients and themselves. This approach has been taken worldwide to more accurately locate patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and to tailor their medical care according to severity of symptoms [15, 16] . In the adult population, it may also allow for early detection of routinely faced conditions that need medical attention such as myocardial infarction or heart failure, arrhythmia, and sepsis. However, one must bear in mind that pediatric telemedicine might be of a trickier nature; children often struggle to describe their symptoms accurately, and pediatricians rely on observation and a complete physical examination in making a diagnosis. This clearly is not possible or difficult in the setting of telemedicine, mostly when done over the phone without video input as described in our cases.

In 2 of our 7 cases, the initial assessment made over the phone by clinicians was incomplete or led to missing important warning signs. In our opinion, using telemedicine to substantially reduce in person medical consultations in the COVID-19 era should be done with caution while using video when possible and taking into serious consideration parental concerns raised during the evaluation.
