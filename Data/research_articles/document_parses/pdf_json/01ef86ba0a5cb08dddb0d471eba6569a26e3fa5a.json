Moreover, as in older children with asthma response, bronchodilator and bronchoconstrictor stimuli can be assessed (42) , Besides reversible airway obstruction, other information can be obtained by the flow-volume loop, A flattened inspiratory phase suggests an airway obstruction localized above the vocal cords -laryngomalacia, for example -while flattening of the expiratory limb is characteristic of intrathoracic airway obstruction as in tracheomalacia (3), Other ways to assess the severity of infant respiratory disease and the efficacy of bronchodilator therapy are resistance measurements and evaluation of functional residual capacity by body plethysmography or gas dilution. This last technique can be used to evaluate gas mixing, which is a sensitive indicator of obstructive lung disease in infants,, children, and adults. Useful information can be obtained by monitoring the respiratory rate during quiet sleep by capnography or measuring nasal thermal changes, and by measuring chest wall motion by respiratory inductance plethysmography. The quantitation of the tidal expiratory flow pattern as the ratio of the time to peak tidal expiratory flow (Tme) divided b} the expiratory time (Te), 7\"me/Te, may show low values in obstructive lung disease and abnormally shaped tidal expiratory flow-time curves (1), In infants with recurrent or persistent wheezing who have not had previous radiologie investigation, a posterior and lateral chest radiograph is strongly indicated to exclude parenchymal lung disease, as well as congenital anomalies of the lung, cardiac diseases, and foreign bodies (76) , The barium swallow procedure with careful observation of swallowing is indicated if the plain chest radiograph is inconclusive and there remains a suspicion of recurrent inhalation or anatomic abnormalities. Persistent wheezing which is unresponsive or poorly responsive to appropriate treatment should be investigated by fiber-optic or rigid hronchoscopy (88, 89), The now standard pediatric flexible bronchoscope is 3,5 mm in diameter with a 1,2-mm internal suction channel. Although it is quite possible to perform flexible bronchoscopy with this instrument in small infants, including premature infants, the added airway resistance limits the duration of the procedure to rather short times. Very thin flexible bronchoscopes (1.8 and 2,3 mm in diameter, and 2.7 mm in diameter with distal angulation) appear to be a signiflcant new elinieal tool for observation of airway dynamics with relatively little mechanical interference also if inserted through existing endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes (88), Diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy IS indicated in speciflc conditions such as stridor, persistent atelectasis, wheezing, recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, lung lesions of unknown cause. chronic cough, and hemoptysis, and to assess injury from toxic or milk inhalation. The 3-5-mm-diameter instrument can be used to obtain samples or aspiration of airway secretions and mucous plugs (88), The rigid bronchoscope is more suitable for the removal of foreign bodies, excision of granulation tissue, and examination of tracheoesophageal fistulas (89),", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1073, "end": 1077, "text": "(42)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2569, "text": "(76)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinieal history"}, {"text": "The final diagnostic criterion is a trial of appropriate asthma therapy (16), Nevertheless, there remains much controversy about the use of (3 2 adrenergic agents in wheezing infants (35. 60), Howe\\'er. it has been observed that the failure of some studies to demonstrate beneficial response may be due to a number of potential methodologic problems.

This resulted in more appropriate treatment with bronchodilators and antiinflammatory agents and in reduced morbidity, but also, as stated by Wilson, in \"a loss of pathophysiological precision which may have implications that are not purely academic\" (84). Although wheezing lower respiratory tract illness in early childhood and asthma share some common risk factors, sufficient data exist to show that their relative importance differs between each condition (61, 64. 85) . Several indices of neonatal lung function are reduced in infants who subsequently develop episodes of wheezing associated with viral infection (39, 70) . Evidence does not link wheezing in the first 2 years of life with atopy (28). In contrast, most schoolchildren with asthma are atopic, and the severity of the disease in this age group is clearly related to the degree of atopic sensitization (90). Wheezy infants have been shown to have a level of airway responsiveness which is the same in young infants (66) or decreased in 3-year-olds (86) compared with controls. Instead, atopy and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness are two markers often found to be associated with asthma at school age and beyond (57, 58) . Furthermore, the pattern of wheeze is episodic with prolonged symptom-free periods in early life and both episodic and intercurrent symptoms in atopic schoolchild asthma (61. 85). Moreover, the medium-term prognosis of the episodic viral wheeze of the first 2 years of life is excellent in the vast majority of subjects since very few of them develop childhood asthma (21. 51, 65). As Silverman reported, \"the differences between viral induced wheezing of early childhood and atopic schoolchild asthma are so striking that one can only conclude that the two disorders are totally independent\" (61) . Thus, the disorder of many recurrent!} wheezing mfants and toddlers could be labeled \"wheezy bronchitis\" rather than \"asthma\" (36, 61. 64, 84, 85). However, \"wheezy bronchitis\" is more a description of symptoms than a diagnosis, and probably we should use the term \"asthma syndrome\" until the pathophysiology of the disorder has been fully clarified in all the pediatric ages. Because asthma is an underdiagnosed problem, it could be dangerous to avoid the term \"asthma\" and the word \"syndrome\" can be used to describe the set of symptoms and signs which occur together in wheezing children.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 367, "end": 371, "text": "(71)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 835, "end": 847, "text": "(61, 64. 85)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 993, "end": 997, "text": "(39,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 998, "end": 1001, "text": "70)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1363, "text": "(66)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1566, "text": "(57,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1570, "text": "58)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2170, "text": "(61)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Auoiiialics of ihc inichcohyonclmil ircc the label '^asthma''?

The full potential of this investigational tool is still unrealized because of the lack of standardized methods and reference values obtained from sufficient numbers of subjects. A number of problems must be resolved in the coming years before measurements of pulmonary function in infants can be recommended for wide clinical use in healthy and sick infants. The potential sources of variation in the measurements need to be characterized and limited m order to obtain reproducible results, which, we must remember, are difficult to interpret and can be obtained w ith a certain degree of reliability only after substantial training with the different techniques. For this reason, we must develop training programs m infant lung function testing, at least for simple noninvasive methods which could be used as an objective epidemiologic tool.

In susceptible individuals, this inflammation causes symptoms which are usually associated w ith widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment, and causes an associated increase in airway responsiveness to a variety of stimuli\" (45) . Because of the scanty information concerning the pathology of asthma in pediatric patients, the concept of eosinophil-mediated airway inflammation was not incorporated in the definition of asthma recent!} elaborated by an international committee of pediatric pu!mono!ogists (77) . Therefore, pediatricians are sti!! using a vague definition of the disorder (76) . Now we are again in the midd!e of a debate between two distinct schoo!s of thought: whether wheezing in infancy and wheezing in later chi!dhood are distinct clinical entities of distinct etiology, or whether they are caused by a common under!ying defect. Although recent studies (61, 64, 84, 85 ) support the first thesis, information concerning the pathophysiologic characteristics of the two conditions is !imited. This is true not only of wheezing in infants but also in school-age asthmatic children. The distinction between the episodic viral wheeze (wheezy bronchitis) and the atopic wheeze (asthma) will allow a better definition of the anatomy and the physiology of the airways in the two conditions but will carry the risk of undertreatment. as previously observed (2. 63), Until more information is generated, the term \"asthma syndrome\" could be used to label both viraland allergen-induced asthma in children. However. a wide range of congenital and acquired disorders associated with wheezing (Table 1) should be excluded by clinical history, physical e.xamination. and laboratory tests. The erroneous inclusion of all wheezing within the \"asthma syndrome'\" will be a dramatic backward step for both the generation of scientific knowledge and the application of appropriate treatment.
