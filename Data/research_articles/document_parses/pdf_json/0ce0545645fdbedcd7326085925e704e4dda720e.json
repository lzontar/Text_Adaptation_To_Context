Compared to White patients, those from BAME backgrounds were younger, with differing co-morbidity profiles and less frailty.

Higher rates of invasive ventilation in intensive care indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and Black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19. severity or mortality. However, the underlying causes were unclear. Aggregated US data determined the relative risk of death for those of Black ethnicity compared to White ethnic groups to be 3.57. Three UK biobank cohort studies, limited by low BAME representation, described ethnicity as an independent risk factor of COVID-19 infection, partially attenuated by socio-economic status (SES). Analysis of a London hospital cohort of 520; experiencing 144 deaths, revealed an age and co-morbidity adjusted mortality odds ratio of 1.72 in Black populations of borderline significance. Age and geographical region-adjusted standardised mortality ratios, derived from UK composite hospital data, emphasised ethnic differences; being 2.41 for Bangladeshis and 3.24 for Black Africans. The impact of gender and deprivation was not explored. Another study of 5683 in-hospital deaths (England alone; 629 (11%) BAME) confirmed increased mortality risks in people from Black and Asian groups only partially attributable to social deprivation and co-morbidity but did not adjust for other vulnerability factors. There remained a need for a more detailed analysis of outcomes across different ethnic groups in a large, high acuity dataset, adjusting for broader clinical and laboratory prognostic factors, alongside SES, smoking status, age, body mass index (BMI) and sex.",

It offers detailed insight into a majority (60%) ethnically diverse cohort and adds substantial evidence that ethnicity is a predictor of poor outcomes for COVID-19 patients at, and beyond, 30 days. Using robust multivariable survival analyses we have quantified and described the impact on this association of a number of additional prognostic factors such as frailty score and markers of inflammation alongside age, sex, deprivation, co-morbidity, BMI and smoking status. Those of Asian and Black ethnicities were consistently found to have an increased risk of 30 and 90 day mortality and an increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation as compared to those of White ethnicity. The peak CRP and D-dimer levels in those of Black ethnicity were significantly higher than those of other ethnicities suggesting that these biological differences may accompany greater disease severity and increased risk of adverse outcomes.",

The association appears to be underpinned by a combination of factors including SES, pre-existing health conditions, biological risk factors such as D-dimers, environmental and structural determinants of health; but their relative contribution is unclear.

Older age, male sex, obesity and pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension have all been identified as risk factors for poor outcomes (2) (3) (4) . A disproportionate impact of disease severity and death on people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds has been reported, though not consistently. The UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) noted that whilst BAME groups only make up 14% of the UK population, they comprised 33% of COVID-19 patients on intensive care units (5) . The degree of this excess risk also appears to differ across, and within, these heterogeneous ethnic groups. In the UK, recent analyses of data from the Office of National Statistics and NHS England described 2.5-4.3 fold greater COVID-19 mortality rates, compared to White groups, across a range of Black and South Asian ethnic groups (6) . Whether this adverse association is driven by underlying co-morbid disease, socio-economic inequality, genetic factors or a complex interplay of them all is unclear (7) . Current data are limited in either number of COVID-19 patients, ethnic diversity or event rates with limited adjustment for known risk factors and potential predictors (8) (9) (10) (11) . There is an urgent need for the detailed characterisation of ethnic differences in COVID-19 outcomes and associated risk factors, within diverse populations, to inform practice and policy. Identifying and responding to these ethnic inequalities will be key to mitigating the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on BAME patients. (13) . This large, regional dataset afforded extensive analyses of COVID-19 patients of a higher acuity than other studies. We aimed to examine the demographic, socio-economic, behavioural, biochemical and clinical risk factors associated with outcomes within different ethnic groups of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, using multivariable survival analyses.",

The proportional-hazard assumption was assessed by inspection of scaled Schoenfeld residual plots and investigated by stratification (20) . Logistic regression modelling of ethnicity on ICU treatment using mechanical ventilation was carried out.

We found different ethnic groups had differing agedistribution of baseline comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia.

Health inequalities within and between ethnic minority groups are widely documented and the effects of structural racism are transmitted across generations(27). The risk factors already discussed such co-morbidity and obesity are speculated to intersect and be inextricably linked with wider social determinants such as poor living conditions, key worker roles and language barriers which impede the adoption of preventative measures(25, 28, 29) . Some researchers have postulated that ethnicity may be associated with decreased symptom recognition and poor health literacy resulting in delayed presentation for care-something that could contribute to the greater illness-severity we observed (30) .",

In contrast to previous studies examining ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes we were able to address the contributions of socio-economic deprivation, comorbid disease, premorbid function, lifestyle and demographic factors to ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, including ICU interventions. Our analysis was strengthened by the inclusion of measures of frailty which is a critical determinant of outcomes in acute disease as well as a potential driver of clinician decision-making. It should be acknowledged, however, that frailty has social and biological dimensions and measures have not been extensively validated in BAME groups.",

We also imputed missing data and performed sensitivity analyses on our multivariable comorbidity models. This reinforced the observed ethnic differences, providing further confidence that our findings were not affected by missing data. Like many datasets, our ethnic categorisations were aggregated and did not reflect the vast heterogeneity within ethnic categories (such as Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Black African or Black Caribbean). Indeed, the descriptive term \"BAME\" itself is particularly crude and we recognise its limitation. Despite its size, our study lacked the power to assess a more detailed ethnicity breakdown. In addition, our observations in those of Asian ethnicity are likely skewed by our large Bangladeshi community, which has specific socio-economic and healthcare inequalities. It is therefore important that, suitably powered, analyses are conducted to expose differences between sub-ethnic categories. Similarly, whilst we have explored socio-economic factors, our analysis does not allow us to contextualise a number of potential socio-spatial factors including household composition, environmental factors and occupation. These should be considered in future research.",
