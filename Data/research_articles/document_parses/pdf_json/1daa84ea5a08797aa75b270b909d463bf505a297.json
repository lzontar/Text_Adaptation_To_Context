His vital parameters were: blood pressure 135/70 mmHg, heart rate 74 bpm, respiratory rate 14 breaths/min, and peripheral oxygen saturation 96%. Blood gas analysis revealed: pH 7.4, pCO 2 40 mmHg, pO 2 73.9 mmHg, P/F 352, and alveolar-arterial gradient 26 (expected value for age: 17). The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a mean heart rate of 70 bpm.

Lung auscultation revealed a slightly reduced vesicular murmur in the right basal region. Heart sounds were normal. There was no oedema in the lower limbs or pain on palpation. Blood examination revealed: white blood cells (WBC) 7700\u00d7109/l, neutrophils 5.2\u00d710 9 /l, lymphocytes 1.8\u00d710 9 /l, D-dimer 1.5 mg/l, INR 1.0, aPTT ratio <0.8, platelets 202\u00d710 9 /l, LDH 468 U/l, AST 83 U/l, ALT 30 U/l, C-reactive protein 1.55 mg/dl, procalcitonin 0.2 ng/ml and creatinine 0.9 mg/dl. Lung ultrasound showed minimum pleural effusion in the right basal field, while a round pleural-based consolidation was present with some B lines in the right field (Fig. 1) . A chest CT scan was therefore performed and showed filling defects compatible with non-occlusive thromboembolism at the level of the apico-dorsal segmental branch of the upper right lobe and of the subsegmental branches of all right lobes and of lower lung lobes on the left. There was also complete occlusion of a peripheral subsegmental vessel to the dorsal segment of the lower right lobe (Figs. 2 and 3) . Small ground-glass opacities were evidenced in the parailary lung field near the upper right lobe. A modest pleural film was seen on the right (Fig. 4) . There was no mediastinal lymphadenomegaly. The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A subsequent angiogram with echo colour Doppler did not reveal any venous thrombosis in the limbs. The patient underwent anticoagulant therapy. ",

            "text": "The final diagnosis was bilateral pulmonary embolism in a patient positive for COVID-19. Reports in the literature have shown that thromboembolic disease is strongly associated with, or even an integral part of, COVID-19 pneumonia. Indeed, endothelial/microvascular damage to pulmonary capillaries seems to be the main trigger for pneumonia. Virus binding to pneumocytes via the ACE-2 receptor causes pneumocytic damage with activation of the inflammatory response and release of prothrombotic factors [3] . The most surprising finding in our case was the lack of the classic clinical signs of thromboembolic disease: the patient had no oedema or pain in the lower limbs, no history of trauma or immobilization, and no prothrombotic or active neoplastic disease, resulting in a negative pretest probability score (Well's score = 0). Moreover, there were no ancillary signs such as a tachycardia. Our patient had several findings suspicious for COVID-19. The P/F value and an increased alveolar-arterial gradient suggested mild respiratory failure. Also, lung ultrasound showed mild pleural effusion and consolidation with a specific morphology: small peripheral pulmonary embolisms characterized by lesions with a clear morphology (no pneumonia shred sign), with a clear pleural base, often round or triangular shaped, with few or no B lines [4, 5] . In addition, D-dimer blood levels were above the upper limit of normal. These findings led us to request higher level imaging, which confirmed the clinical suspicion. Our clinical case demonstrates how thromboembolic disease can manifest very differently in a patient with SARS-CoV-2: rather than peripheral venous thrombosis inducing a pulmonary embolism, the virus and inflammatory response induce primary disease of the pulmonary circulation. This raises clear diagnostic concerns, since the normal procedure for diagnosing thromboembolic disease does not seem to be valid. In the context of large-scale screening for COVID-19, simple, low-cost and repeatable methods such as blood gas analysis and lung ultrasound can be valuable. First, evaluation of gas exchange data (P/F and alveolar-arterial gradient) is useful for assessing respiratory function. Second, ultrasound can provide excellent diagnostic accuracy by visualizing even small peripheral pulmonary infarcts, albeit with the known limitations as regards deep lesions.",
