In many parts of the world, particularly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere such as the United States and Europe, the etiologic agents associated with ILI have been well characterized. In much of Latin America, however, the epidemiology and etiology of ILI are poorly understood. ILI can be attributed to a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and parainfluenza viruses. Adenovirus, RSV, and parainfluenza viruses can cause severe disease particularly in children, accounting for a considerable proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality [1, 2] . Enteroviruses and HSV have been isolated from patients with acute respiratory infections and these viruses may also cause infections such as pharyngitis [3, 4] .

To date, the data presented here represent the most thorough description of ILI-causing viruses throughout Peru. During the two years of surveillance reported in this study, upper respiratory viruses were isolated from greater than 40% of samples collected from nearly 7,000 patients with ILI. As expected, influenza A (23.8% of the total cases) was the predominant diagnosis. During the period of the study, however, we also observed the introduction and emergence of influenza B viruses in these study sites. In addition, parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and HSV were isolated from patient specimens, which collectively contributed to 8.8% of all ILI cases in our study. The prevalences of influenza A and B viruses were significantly higher in ILI patients older than 5 years of age (p,0.001), while other viruses such as parainfluenza, adenovirus, enterovirus, HSV and RSV were more prevalent among participants younger than 5 years. These results are consistent with studies in other regions of South America [18, 19] . Taken together, these data demonstrate that a wide range of viruses need to be considered during the diagnosis of human respiratory illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1163, "end": 1167, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1171, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "HSV is a viral agent not usually considered in patients with upper respiratory complaints. In our study HSV was isolated from 176 (2.6%) of ILI patients. In addition to the respiratory symptoms, we found that 11 (6.2%) HSV-positive participants also had vesicular lesions on the lips, mouth or throat. Mc Millan [3] , in a 16-month study of U.S. college students, found that 5.7% of patients with sore throats had HSV infection and, of those 34% had vesicular lesions and 71% had pharyngeal erithema. In our study, in the majority of cases where HSV was isolated, no other viral infection was detected. However, as HSV is a latent virus that may be reactivated during infections with other pathogens, we cannot conclude that HSV is the causative agent for the infections reported in this study. In addition, it should be noted that nearly 60% of total ILI cases were undiagnosed; suggesting that in HSV-positive cases where no other infection was detected as-of-yet unidentified pathogens may be responsible for the ILI symptoms. A control group without ILI symptoms will be needed to draw more definite conclusions on the role of HSV as a causative agent of ILI symptoms. Nevertheless these data suggest that in the future, HSV should be considered in diagnostic evaluations as a potential cause of ILI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 312, "end": 315, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Distribution of the ILI-causing viruses varied by study site and by region. For example, adenoviruses were more common along the northern coast, in Tumbes and Piura (p,0.001) and much less common in Cusco (p,0.001). The geographic distribution of influenza viruses varied considerably as well. For influenza A viruses, the H3N2 strains predominated in the southern regions of the country (Arequipa, Cusco, Puno, and Puerto Maldonado, specifically), while influenza B viruses were more common in the northern and central regions (Tumbes, Piura, Iquitos, and La Merced). However, it should be noted that almost all detected influenza strains and lineages were found in all study sites, suggesting that newly introduced viral strains will spread to all One shortcoming of a sentinel surveillance program such as this is the potential for sampling bias. As we have limited our studies to two health centers in most cities, our results may not be representative of the entire population. Additionally, we are unable to calculate incidence rates based on our study due to this bias and the lack of reliable population data. To address this shortcoming, we are establishing community-based active surveillance programs in several of these sites to better quantify the impact of ILIs on the population at large. One advantage of the present surveillance is the ability to identify increases in the number of patients seeking medical attention due to ILI symptoms and the diagnosis of the viruses related to such increases, while requiring fewer resources than would be necessary in a population-based study. Furthermore, we found similar influenza viruses present throughout the country, suggesting that a sentinel surveillance program is sufficient for detecting and describing currently circulating influenza lineages. One objective of this study was the identification of circulating influenza strains to help evaluate current vaccine components and inform the composition of future vaccine cocktails. The MoH is planning to start massive vaccination campaigns for at-risk populations in Peru. For influenza A H1N1 viruses, three genotypes were observed: A/Solomon Island/03/06-like, A/ Brisbane/59/07-like and A/New Caledonia/20/99-like. These genotypes include isolates that circulated in Peru in 2006 . Future studies should identify whether this genotype will be the dominant genotype in the current influenza season or whether both lineages will continue to co-circulate. Such data will be important for defining the components of the yearly vaccine.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2294, "end": 2298, "text": "2006", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In Peru like in other South American countries [20] , the unnecessary use of antibiotics is a generalized problem. In this study, 15% of the participants had received antibiotics prior to enrollment, and thus prior to a definitive diagnosis. A large percentage of these participants were found to have a viral agent associated with their illness. These data demonstrate that unnecessary antibiotic use is common for treatment of a patient with influenza-like illness, even without a definitive diagnosis of the etiologic agent [21] . For many of these participants the purchase of antibiotics combinated with paying for the clinic visit can be a major economic imposition thus, it is important to have a better understanding of the pathogens most commonly associated with ILI in the region for both diagnostic and economic purposes. In this study, RIT results were available at the time of enrollment, which helped decrease the unnecessary continual use of antibiotics and thus provided an additional economic benefit for the patients. Unfortunately our study design does not permit us to determine definitively what percentage of participants received antibiotics following a positive RIT result, as follow up interviews were not conducted. We also did not ask participants about use of antiviral drugs since viral inhibitors are not a commonly used treatment for influenza infection in Peru, mostly due to their high cost and low availability.
