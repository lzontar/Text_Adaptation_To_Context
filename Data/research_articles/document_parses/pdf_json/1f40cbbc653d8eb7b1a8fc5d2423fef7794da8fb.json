The aim was to identify the frequency of health-fulfilling physical activity engagement reported by participants. Sufficient physical activity was categorized according to whether participants 'achieved minimum recommendations' (\u2265150 min of moderate physical activity) or 'did not achieve minimum recommendations' (\u2264150 min of moderate physical activity). Participants were further categorized as: inactive (does not engage in physical activity or sport), engaging in physical activity that is not beneficial to health (\u2264300 min of moderate physical activity per week) and engaging in physical activity that is beneficial to health (\u2265300 min of moderate physical activity per week). Possible relationships with psychosocial factors and perceived psychological distress were explored. An ad hoc questionnaire was used to record the time in minutes of physical activity engagement per week. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Trait Meta-mood Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale were also administered. Statically significant differences are shown between the three examined groups: physical inactivity and non-beneficial physical activity; physical inactivity and beneficial physical activity, and; non-beneficial physical activity and beneficial physical activity. Positive and direct correlations were seen with respect to resilience and understanding, and emotional regulation, in addition to negative associations with respect to psychological distress. In conclusion, the more individuals engage in beneficial physical activity, the greater their resilience and emotional management, and the lower their rates of psychological distress.",

In addition, transition to university entails a large step-up as far as academic level is concerned, whilst the emergence of and need to manage new social networks can cause stress and alter the psychological well-being of university students. This study aimed to uncover whether the frequency of physical activity engagement reported by participants can be considered to be healthy, whilst, at the same time examining its potential relationships with psychosocial factors and perceived psychological distress. The objectives of the present study are as follows: Identify the relationship between the adequacy of physical activity engagement, psychosocial parameters (resilience and emotional intelligence), and psychological discomfort. This will uncover associations according to whether individuals are classified as being inactive, engaging in physical activity but below levels considered to be beneficial, and engaging in beneficial physical activity. Such relations will be examined as a function of psychosocial factors (resilience and emotional intelligence) and psychological distress.

Note 3. Differences between IN and NO (a); differences between IN and HEALTHY (b); differences between NO and HEALTHY (c). No statistically significant differences \"p \u2265 0.05\".The correlation between individuals who meet minimum recommended levels of physical activity and specified psychosocial parameters is shown. Firstly, a positive and direct correlation is observed between resilience and emotional understanding (r = 0.405), and resilience and emotional regulation. (r = 0.334). Furthermore, there is a negative and indirect relationship between resilience and psychological distress (r = \u22120.198).These correlations are largely repeated across all dimensions of resilience in those who meet minimal physical activity guidelines. In this way, positive and direct correlations betweenthe dimensions are obtained: LCC (r = 0.326), CAOB (r = 0.255), SRD (r = 0.277), OASS (r = 0.287), and ES (r = 0.115). Similarly, EIR is related with the dimensions of LCC (r = 0.326; r = 0.326), CAOB (r = 0.255; r = 157), SRD (r = 0.277; r = 0.313), OASS (r = 0.287; r = 0.350), and ES (r = 0.115; r = 0.170). EIP is also positively and directly correlated with the ES dimension (r = 0.112), and shows an indirect and negative correlation with psychological distress in the following dimensions: LCC (r = \u22120.233), CAOB (r = \u22120.187), SRD (r = \u22120.178), OASS (r = \u2212178), EIU (r = \u2212287), and EIR (r = \u22120.245). Psychological distress is directly and positively correlated only with IEP (r = 344). Regarding those who do not engage in minimum recommended levels of physical activity, positive and direct correlations are found with resilience (r = 0.205) and the EIP dimensions: CAOB (r = 0.090), SRD (r = 0.093), and ES (r = 0.162). With regards to EIU and EIR, positive and direct correlations are observed with resilience (r = 0.364; r = 446) and the following dimensions: LCC (r = 0.338; r = 0.422), CAOB (r = 0.270; r = 0.285), SRD (r = 0.319; r = 0.404), OASS (r = 0.348; r = 0.442), and ES (r = 0.177; r = 0.288). Finally, in the group that fails to achieve beneficial physical activity, negative and indirect correlations are uncovered between psychological distress and resilience (r = \u22120.352), LCC (r = \u22120.290), CAOB(r = \u22120.234), SRD (r = \u22120.227), OASS (r = \u22120.227), EIU (r = \u22120.122), and EIR (r = \u22120.150). In turn, there is a positive and direct correlation between EIP (r = 0.436) and psychological distress",
