Therefore, specific caution should be suggested in LQTS patients to avoid infection and whenever they get it is, it is clearly dangerous an in house management with drugs in the absence of an adequate QT monitoring. Whenever an in-hospital admission is needed, a careful QT monitoring and a telemetric system should be used. A careful balance of pros and cons should guide the decision to discontinue therapy in case of important QT prolongation.

The healthcare systems of the vast majority of western countries have been built to treat cardiovascular and neurological emergencies, and to treat chronic patients with different disease.

As in Fig. 1 , we designed a 5 levels list of priorities in these patients: 1. Level 1: all the patients with severe, new onset symptoms (heart failure, HF) or lifethreatening arrhythmias requiring immediate treatment; pregnancy management; nondeferrable surgical or percutaneous treatments; 2. Level 2: urgent diagnostic, devices, percutaneous, or surgical procedures; 3. Level 3: new symptoms onset or progressive symptomatology; new referral; 4. Level 4: patients follow-up; 5. Level 5: family screening. The first 2 levels deserve immediate or urgent hospitalization for procedures or nondeferrable treatments. This should follow a \"non COVID-19 pathway\", with dedicated spaces and equipment. Before admission, or at admission for very urgent condition, a COVID-19 PCR nasal and throat swab should be performed in all patients.

Therefore, for everyone, social distancing and the use of facial masks should be mandatory and adequate DPI should be worn by healthcare personnel, to avoid not only that they get ill but that they could become carriers of the infection.
