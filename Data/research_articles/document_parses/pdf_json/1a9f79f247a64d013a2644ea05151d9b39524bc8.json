The related disease, COVID-19, was designated a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020, and was considered a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Epidemiologic data published so far in China suggest that oncohematologic patients are at increased risk of contracting the virus and face severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with greater need for intensive care and higher mortality rates, thus calling into question the riskebenefit analysis of potentially immunosuppressive cancer treatments, especially in elderly patients or in the case of adjuvant therapies. 1 The main measure to limit the SARS-CoV-2 diffusion is quarantine: People are forced to stay at home to prevent its spread. China, as the first nation affected, adopted these measures at the end of January.",

Data collection and large collaboration among centers worldwide are needed to understand the real impact of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on the population of patients with cancer undergoing radiation therapy. This epidemic has an impact also on professionals, not only in terms of risk of infection but also in terms of psychologic stress. These aspects should be considered carefully if we would like to maintain a good level of assistance for our patients.",
