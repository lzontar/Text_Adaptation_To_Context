Logic-based frameworks like LARS allow the execution of complex reasoning on such streams, but it is paramount that the computation is completed in a timely manner before the stream expires. To reduce the runtime, we can extend the validity of inferred conclusions to the future to avoid repeated derivations, but this is not enough to avoid all sources of redundant computation. To further alleviate this problem, this paper introduces a new technique that infers the impossibility of certain derivations in the future and blocks the reasoner from performing computation that is doomed to fail anyway. An experimental analysis on microbenchmarks shows that our technique leads to a significant reduction of the reasoning runtime.",

An example is given by autonomous driving, which is currently one of the most prominent frontiers of AI. As it was recently shown by Suchan et al. [31] , there are situations that cannot (yet) be handled by deep-learning-based computer vision techniques, and this can lead to safety concerns. The occlusion scenario is an example of such a situation. This scenario occurs when another vehicle, which is clearly visible in close proximity, suddenly disappears and reappears shortly after (e.g., due to the steering of a third vehicle). When this event occurs, a system that relies only on the input provided by computer vision might erroneously conclude that the vehicle is no longer in close proximity, and consequently act on this false premise. Humans, in contrast, (usually) apply some logic-based reasoning and conclude that the vehicle is still nearby although it is hidden.",

Currently, one of the most prominent frameworks for this type of processing is LARS [5] . LARS is ideal for use cases like the aforementioned one. First, its semantics is grounded on Answer Set Programming (ASP); thus it provides an AI that is explainable by design, which means that it can be used also by non experts or audited by regulators. Second, LARS offers a variety of operators that are specifically designed for modeling streams to allow the execution of complex reasoning without making it harder than it is in ASP. For instance, LARS offers window operators that allow the restriction of the analysis to the last data in the stream, or other operators like @ which specifies when a derived conclusion will be valid.",

Recently, several works have used LARS to implement stream reasoning that reconciles the expressivity of LARS with high performance. One of such reasoner is Ticker [6] , while a more recent distributed implementation is presented in [14] . Another of such reasoners is Laser, which we presented in a previous paper [4] . Laser distinguishes itself from the previous two by focusing on a smaller and more tractable fragment of LARS called Plain LARS. Another distinctive feature is that Laser introduces a new technique that annotates the formulae with two timestamps, called consideration and horizon times, to extend the validity of the formulae in the future to avoid that they are re-derived at each time point. This technique is particularly effective when the body of the rules contains the LARS operators 3 (validity at some time point) or @ (validity at one specific time point), and it can lead to significantly faster runtimes. However, this technique does not work with the operator 2 (validity at all time points) because the semantics of this operator is such that the validity cannot be guaranteed in the future.",

Our technique targets formulae for which the consideration and horizon timestamps are not effective (i.e., the rules that use the 2 operator). The main idea is to identify the cases when it will be impossible to produce some derivations in the future and to use this knowledge to disable rules that won't be able to produce any new conclusion. For example, consider the LARS rule 3 2p(a) \u2192 q(a). This rule specifies that if the fact p(a) appears in the stream in last three time points, then we can infer q(a). In this case, if the stream does not contain p(a) at the current time point, then we can conclude that for the next three time points the rule will never be able to infer q(a), thus making it an \"impossible derivation\". Since we know that it is impossible that q(a) will be derived, we can disable the rule and simplify reasoning. Moreover, if other rules use q(a) in their body, then they can also be disabled, with a further improvement of the performance.",

For instance, at time point 2 the formula 10 3highT emp(b 1 ) is annotated with a consideration time equals to 2 (i.e., the first time point where this formula is inferred). Instead, the horizon time equals to 12 since we know that the body of the rule will hold until 12. The annotated formula with these timestamps is denoted as 10 3highT emp(b 1 ) [2, 12] . From these annotations, it also follows that the fact warning(b 1 ) can be annotated as warning(b 1 ) [2, 12] .

In Fig. 1a , we can see that if the number of input atoms increases and the window size remains constant, then the average runtime remains relatively constant or even decreases. This behavior is due to the usage of the horizon time introduced in [4] which extends the validity of a formula for as many time points as the window size. Moreover, reasoning at each time point has a fixed cost that is amortized over the input facts. If there are more input facts, this cost becomes less prominent. This explains the slight decrease in the runtime when the input size increases.",

Consequently, the runtime increases both when the window size increases (since the reasoner has to check that the facts hold at more time points) and when the size of the stream increases. This shows that the evaluation of 2 can be much more challenging than 3. The increase of the runtime is observed with both implementations although with Laser2 it is less pronounced. The reason behind this difference is purely technical and due to the fact that the new implementation does not have the overhead introduced by the interpretation layer of Python.",

In essence, the idea is to use a stream where every n time points there are no q\u2212facts so that n 2q(X, Y ) does not hold and consequently the rule is disabled. This scenario represents the best case for our method because without it the reasoner would need to evaluate the rule at each time point. Figures 2a and 2b report the total number of formulae evaluations and the average runtime per input fact with different window and stream sizes. The results marked with \"With IP\" (\"Without IP\") use (don't use) our technique. The results show that with our approach the reasoner evaluates many fewer formulae (because the rule is disabled most of the time). Note that when our technique is enabled the number of evaluated formulae is non-zero. The reason is that every n time points the counter for disabling the rule expires and the rule is re-added to the set of active rules. This event occurs less frequently if the window size is larger. This explains why the number of evaluated formulae decreases in Fig. 2a .",

To simulate this case, we consider programs with the rule 10 3p(X, Y ), n 2q(X, Y ) \u2192 m(X, Y ) where n (i.e., the window size) is very small. In particular, we considered n \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. If n = 1 and the rule is disabled, then our approach immediately re-adds it in the next iteration since its invalidity has expired. For this reason, we can use this type of program to measure the overhead of our approach with an input where it is not effective. As input streams, we consider those that add the facts m i:=1 {p(a i , a i )} at each time point where m \u2208 {100, 500, 1000}. Note that since no fact with predicate q appears in the stream, the rule will always try to disable it (unless it was already previously disabled) but in the next 1, 2, or 3 time points the rule will be re-activated. Figures 3a and 3b report, similarly as before, the number of formulae evaluations and the runtime per input fact. From these results, we observe that when the window size is one (which is the worst scenario), the number of evaluations is the same as when our technique is disabled. However, the overhead incurred by our approach significantly increases the runtime. If the window size increases, then the performance improves because the overhead is less prominent.",

We observe a similar trend as in the previous cases: Without our technique, at each time point the reasoner evaluates many more formulae and the runtime is significantly higher.

First, it is interesting to study whether more advanced techniques can determine a longer time validity (or invalidity) for formulae which are beyond plain LARS (e.g., nested windows). Moreover, a dynamic strategy can be designed to detect whether for some formulae a na\u00efve recomputation is faster. Such a strategy could be used to mitigate the performance decrease observed in the worst-case scenario. Finally, our technique is triggered when no atoms with a certain predicate appear in the stream. It is possible that a more fine-grained technique, which considers facts rather than predicates, leads to improvements in more cases, but it is not trivial to implement it without introducing significant overhead.",
