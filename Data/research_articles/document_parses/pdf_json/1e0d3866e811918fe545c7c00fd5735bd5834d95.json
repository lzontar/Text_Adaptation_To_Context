There are a few people in the communities who have already infected Covid-19 virus from the beginning and are spreading the virus into the community but do not know if they are infected the virus. Consequently, the virus is spreading through the people who are in close contact with one another. 2. The virus is spreading through the areas based on a time-dependent infected rate per person in which it will be spreading at a very slow rate from the beginning due to a small number of infected people and will be spreading at a growth rate much faster due to more number of people who have already infected the virus and are in close contact with non-infected individuals as the time progress, and hopefully with the help of testing strategies and those restrictions designed to limit the spread of Covid-19, then growing slowly until it reaches the maximum daily death toll related to Covid-19 virus. 3.
