This event is having a huge negative impact worldwide, not only under an healthcare perspective, but also under the economic, social and cultural ones. SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causative agent of the pandemic outbreak. It is a newly encountered member of the coronavirus family belonging to the RNA-viruses. Its behaviour is comparable to influenza viruses or SARS-CoV the causative agent of the pandemic outbreak 2002/03 of [1] [2] . As soon as virus particles get into a host (human), they start invading cells (in this case, predominantly the ones in the respiratory tract) and these replicate the genome of the virus. Virus particles get into the hosts saliva and humans infect each other by talking to infected individuals, touching hands and close face-to-face interaction [2] [3] . A number that is a good landmark for the transmission rate, or the infectiousness of any infectious disease, is the basic reproduction number (R 0 ): this defines the average number of people that are infected by a single carrier over a defined period of time. R 0 is an indicator of the transmissibility of the epidemic and it has been defined as the average number of secondary cases that a single case can generate in a completely susceptible population. R 0 is of course dependent on the characteristics of the epidemic itself; however, it also depends on the population sample we are considering. The higher the human interaction in a population is, the higher the value R 0 will be. Among the factors that can influence R 0 in a given population there are therefore social habits and social organization. The basic reproduction number is therefore mutable depending on these aspects, and the analysis of its variation in time can be crucial to monitor the trend in the transmissibility among a single population. For our specific case of study, i.e. the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, it is important to study the variation of R 0 in time before and after the implementation of lockdown measures, as well as after its removal. In our modified SIR model, we let R 0 vary in time as a consequence of quarantine. As we will show later, this will also allows us better reproduce real data, as well as have a predictive view on the whole trend of the epidemic.",

The SIR model is based on the assumption of a totally susceptible population at time t 0 , i.e. the beginning of the spreading. In the SIR model, the overall population of N individuals is divided into 3 categories: susceptibles (S), infected (I) and removed (R). Hence, at a given time t from the beginning of the spreading of the epidemic, I(t) and S(t) are the number of infected people present in the population and the number of vulnerable people that have not contracted the virus yet, respectively, while R(t) is the sum of the ones that have developed immunity (recovered) or deceased and are therefore removed from the susceptible count. It is straightforward to notice that, at any time t, S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N . The SIR model purpose is to describe the variation in time of S(t), I(t), and R(t) meaning the migration in time of individuals among these 3 categories.

If R 0 \u2264 1 the epidemic will stop spontaneously, while with R 0 > 1 it will continue spreading. In Fig.  1 we show two different evolution patterns of the pandemic, to demonstrate the effect of different values of \u03b2. Both simulations start with the initial condition of 1 infected person, for a population of N =1000 people in total, and fixing \u03b3 = 0.1 (i.e. typical duration of the illness of 10 days). In both panels the blue line represents the number S of susceptible people which at time t = 0 days coincides with almost the entire population (for our simulation: S(0) = 1000\u22121) and then decreases as both the recovered and infected numbers (green and red lines, respectively) increase. After an interval of time, in both the simulations, the infected number I reaches a peak, the value of which is dependent on the parameter \u03b2. After that time, the number of infected decreases as the recovered increase and ultimately reaches the total number of individuals. In the simulation on the left we set \u03b2 = 0.5 while on the right we assume \u03b2 = 0.25, to simulate the implementation of social distancing actions. We notice that in the left panel the peak of infected people comes after 20 days, with roughly half the population infected. On the right panel the peak is shifted and comes after 50 days and the number of infected people at the peak is less than the half of the previous case. This shows the importance of social distancing, since social distancing and quarantines reduce the parameter \u03b2, helping in reducing the number of infected people at the peak of the epidemic. This is indispensable to avoid the collapse of the healthcare system, and especially the intensive care units. Although a simulation with the standard SIR appears to be adequate to describe an epidemic spreading in a sample where all the initial conditions remain constant throughout the period of time, it is not sufficient when it comes to a more complex and realistic situation such as the population of a given country, where the parameters of the model are influenced by other external factors. From this the necessity to modify the model for our case of study. In the classic SIR model the parameter \u03b2 is constant, therefore it cannot account for the effect produced by quarantine actions, that would have also a dynamical impact on the parameter R 0 (t). For this reason, it is useful to go beyond the classic SIR model, as explained in the next section.",

We used the data of Protezione Civile [12], starting on February 24th, 2020 (therefore, this date corresponds to time zero of our model). We use N = 60.36\u00d710 6 people as population and, as initial conditions, we choose R 0 = 0 and I 0 = 221, corresponding to the number of infected people on the 24th of February. In order to find the best model, we minimize the mean squared error between predictions and true data, allowing the 4 free parameters to vary. We consider as a last update the 17th of May. The best fit is given by Figure 3 : Simulation of future scenarios, fixing a certain value of R 0 at the 4th of May. We identify 3 regions, corresponding to low risk (green), mid risk (orange) and high risk (red) situations.",

Using this model we were able to predict the peak of the epidemic 1.5 months before it happened, with an error of 1 week on the period and an error smaller than 10% on the absolute numbers. We have also presented possible future scenarios, assuming different intervals of the parameter R 0 (t) after the 4th of May, i.e. when the lockdown in Italy has been released. We conclude explaining our procedure to compute R 0 (t), as a function of time, for Italy and Italian regions.
