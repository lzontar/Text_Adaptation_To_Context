Methods: Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. Results: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (r = \u00c00.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 AE 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and Creactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype.

Frequent interactions of human beings and wild animals make them a common source of zoonotic infections. SRAS-CoV-2 was another identified coronavirus with human infection ability apart from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as was Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Kickbusch and Leung, 2020) and it's genomic sequences showed close relation to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21; homology modeling revealed a similar receptor-binding domain structure to SARS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020) .

However, due to the conduction of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 only at the CDC and the strain of spectrum of the available diagnostic tools for this newly discovered virus at this time (Phan, 2020) , imaging examination is one of the quick and convenient methods to diagnosis and monitor disease progress during treatment. However, imaging findings of pneumonia caused by viruses can be completely different, sometimes overlapping with other infectious and inflammatory diseases.

The imaging of non-pneumonia patients at initial admission may gradually progress. There was no obvious abnormality in CT examination of patients with a positive nucleic acid test, which suggested that there might be some lag between Xray and CT examination; those patients should be monitored closely in case of necessary timely treatment. However, in contrast with patients infected with H1N1 in which diarrhea is associated with chest X-ray abnormalities (Cao et al., 2009) , differences in gastrointestinal symptoms of the two groups in our study were not significant.

Laboratory results were also monitored, since we found that the patients with imaging abnormalities had lower lymphocytes, albumin, serum sodium levels, and higher lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels. This finding may suggest that that having pneumonia may be associated with severe disease, thus these patients tended to have more severe clinical features. This was in accordance with a lower oxygenation index, an index to evaluate the respiratory function and the severity of the disease. For further study, a radiographic score which may be helpful for a rough estimation of lung lesions was proposed.

Given the significantly higher rate of glucocorticoid application in patients with abnormal imaging than that of their counterpart, a former study showed proper use of corticosteroids in critical SARS reduced mortality (Chen et al., 2006) . Thus, patients with multiple lobes involvement may be considered for corticosteroids to control the progression of disease. Oxygen therapy plays a key role in the supportive treatment of patients. Generally, patients with hypoxemia (PaO 2 < 60 mmHg or SaO 2 < 90% in the air condition) or with the symptoms of dyspnea may be considered for oxygen therapy by nasal cannula or mask. When the symptom of hypoxemia is improved (SaO 2 > 90% or the level of PaO 2 reaches 60\u00c070 mmHg), the flow of oxygen can be gradually reduced and even stopped. Otherwise, high flow oxygen inhalation or noninvasive ventilation should be considered, and invasive ventilation can be adopted if the disease still progresses (National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2020). However, some patients may be administered low flow oxygen therapy on admission to reduce the burden on the lungs. In our study, we also found the rate of oxygen therapy in patients with abnormal imaging was significantly higher, which may be related to a lower oxygenation index.
