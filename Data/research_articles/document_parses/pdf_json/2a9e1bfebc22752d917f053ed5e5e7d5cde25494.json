The antiviral effects of siRNA duplexes targeting the VP16 and DNA polymerase genes of HSV-1 were evaluated by yield-reduction and plaque-reduction assays. The effect of siRNA on the expression of target genes was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results. Two siRNA duplexes (siRNA-1, targeting VP16, and siRNA-4, targeting DNA polymerase), were found to be highly effective in inhibiting HSV-1 replication. siRNA-1 and siRNA-4 reduced HSV-1 replication by around 2 log 10 and 1 log 10 in the yield-reduction assay and by 85% and 70% in the plaque-reduction assay, respectively. Significant decreases in the mRNA level of VP16 and DNA polymerase genes were detected after viral infection in the Vero cells pretreated with siRNA-1 and siRNA-4, respectively. Conclusion.

The enhanced antiviral effect was observed with cotransfection of \u2021 2 siRNAs targeting the viral genes of nsp-12, -13-and -16 and the Spike protein in SARS coronavirus infection. 11 This effect could be explained by the specific binding of certain siRNAs that may change the secondary structure of RNA and therefore result in more accessible sites for other siRNA molecules. However, this is not a universal finding as no additive or synergistic effect on antiviral activity was observed in a study when using any combination between the specific siRNA targeting viral protease 2A and any other siRNAs targeting the 5\u00a2 untranslated region, start codon and RNA polymerase 3D of coxsackie virus B3. 14 In the present study, no synergistic effect was noted when two siRNA duplexes were used. The reason for the discrepancy between the studies is not clear; however, the use of multiple siRNAs concurrently remains an attractive approach in the development of clinical antiviral agents because of its potential to limit viral escape due to mutation. Our data showed that siRNAs achieved potent inhibition of HSV-1 replication both before and after viral infection. The observed effective prophylactic inhibitory activities of siRNAs suggest the potential value of siRNAs as a preventative measure against HSV-1 infection and recurrent infection caused by virus reactivation.
