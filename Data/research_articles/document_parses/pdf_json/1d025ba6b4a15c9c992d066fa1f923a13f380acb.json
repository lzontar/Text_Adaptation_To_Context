Additionally, we were unable to confirm that the ORF3 deletion in Hu/Aseer_KSA_RS924_2015 is also present in the clinical specimen because we were only able to recover the spike sequence from the clinical specimen due to limited volume. It is a limitation of the study. The patient from which Hu/ Aseer_KSA_RS924_2015 (\u0394ORF3) was isolated died during the course of the illnesses.
