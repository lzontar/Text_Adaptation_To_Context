This finding was instrumental in the development of the gauze mask introduced by Johann von Mikulicz Radecki [ Fig. 2 ] in the same year [2] . Radecki was also the first to use medical gloves during surgery. In the early 1900s, the propagation of use of masks to reduce the spread of scarlet fever and diphtheria boosted the confidence of the medical fraternity in this invention by reports of zero cross infections [3, 4] . Gradually, their use spread to military hospitals during World War 1, when preventing cross respiratory infections in overflowing wards bustling with attendants had become a herculean task. The dramatically positive results encouraged studies in large numbers to determine the most efficient mask. While most of the work in this era focused on control of disease transmission in medical wards, it was in the third to fifth decade of the twentieth century that use of masks in the OR (operating room) became widespread. Through the work of Meleny in 1932 and Davis in 1937, it was proved that operating personnel were carriers of fatal Gram-positive organisms which in reported events lead to wound infections and, infrequently, death of patients [5, 6] . It is then that the routine use of masks to cover the nose and mouth in the operating room became a standard of care.",
