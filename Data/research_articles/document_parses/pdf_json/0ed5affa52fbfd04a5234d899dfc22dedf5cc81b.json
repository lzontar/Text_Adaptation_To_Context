While Alberici et al. 1 report withdrawal of baseline immunosuppression in 20 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and mainly continuation with methylprednisolone, Banerjee et al. 2 pursued more gentle reduction of immunosuppression with mainly discontinuation of the antimetabolite in 7 patients with COVID-19 infection of varying severity. However, in 2 of the 7 patients the calcineurin inhibitor Tacrolimus was additionally stopped because of severe respiratory distress syndrome. The corresponding editorial 3 suggests switching to the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine as a possible further approach for future exploration as in vitro data report suppression of viral replication for various coronaviruses at noncytotoxic concentrations regardless of immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine. 4 In line with this, we report the first renal allograft recipient converted to cyclosporine during COVID-19 infection. The 45-year-old male had been transplanted 16 years ago. His immunosuppression consisted of only the antimetabolite mycophenolate mofetil. On admission the patient presented with typical symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia including fever, cough, dyspnea and crazy paving pattern in CT scan.
