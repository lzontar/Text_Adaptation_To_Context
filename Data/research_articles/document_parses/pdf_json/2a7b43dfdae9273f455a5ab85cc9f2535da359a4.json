Interleukin 15 can enhance NK cell differentiation and proliferation. ADCC is mainly mediated by NK cells, but it can also be mediated by macrophages. Fc receptor and ADCC signalling gene up-regulation is consistent with the ADCC machinery being turned on after P. falciparum infection. Among the above genes, gene expression levels were greater than two-fold change (range two-to sevenfold; see Table 1 ) in early malaria including: Fc gamma receptor 1A, Fc gamma receptor 3A, Fc epsilon receptor 1G, and TRAIL. Gene expression levels were greater than two-fold change in acute febrile malaria including: Fc alpha receptor, Fc gamma receptor 3B, Fc epsilon receptor 1G, PI3K, MAP2K2, Arf6, KLRC3, KIR3DL2, and CEBP gamma (range two-to four-fold).

Although ADCC signalling genes were not greater than two-fold, they were higher than 1.5-fold change after malarial infection. CTL-related genes (CD8 T cells in Table 1 ) were only moderately up-regulated during malaria. Among these genes, granzyme B, CDC42, and Kras exhibited \u2265 two-fold change during acute febrile malaria. Granzyme B and Kras were \u2265 two-fold change in the recovery period. Although macrophage/monocyte activation is traditionally considered to be a strong marker for classic TH1 type immune response, this study surprisingly found that express levels of most macrophage activation genes were relatively unchanged or slightly suppressed after P. falciparum infection ( Table 2) . These data support the hypothesis that there may be two pathways involved in the induction of TH1 types of immune responses: a TH\u03b1\u03b2 interferon driven path and IL-12 driven path (see Discussion). Most macrophage activation and proliferation-related genes were unchanged ( Table 2) . IL-12 is clearly the major cytokine needed to initiate a strong classic TH1 type immune response, and IL-12 expression levels remain unchanged over the course of this study ( Table 2 ). This observation suggests that the induction of a TH1-type anti-malarial immune response may be driven by cytokines other than IL-12. Like IL-12, other traditional TH1 cytokine: IL-3, M-CSF, and GM-CSF can also cause macrophage proliferation but these genes are also not up-regulated in response to infection with P. falciparum (Table 2 ). In contrast, many macrophage Summary of gene expression of the four immunological pathways during the early malaria, acute febrile malaria, and recovery period compared to un-infection baseline. Red means gene expression with greater than two-fold up-regulation. Yellow means gene expression with 1.5-2-fold up-regulation. Green means gene expression was not changed. Square shape means genes which activate the cell, and ellipse shape means genes which suppress the cell. Although interferon alpha/beta was not detected, (IRF7) means that this up-regulated gene regulates the transcription of interferon alpha/beta. inhibition-related genes were up-regulated after malaria, including haem oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), JunB, and IRF1. JunB, PU.1 and IRF1 suppress macrophage proliferation. As indicated above, a macrophage differentiation inducer, MafB, is up-regulated after malaria. Its antagonists, JunB and PU.1, were also up-regulated, so the effect of MafB could be suppressed. PU.1 up-regulation can drive monocytes to differentiate into dendritic cells instead of macrophages. Although macrophages can also express Fc receptor genes, this study thinks these Fc receptor expression after malaria should mainly occur in NK cells. The Fc receptor signalling pathway (ADCC signalling pathway) in NK cell was all up-regulated (Table 1) . Also, DAP12 upregulation can suppress Fc receptor signalling in macrophages, so it is less likely that these up-regulated Fc receptors belong to macrophages. Although IL-10 itself was not up-regulated, many IL-10 downstream genes were upregulated as shown in Figure 1 of the previous analysis results [7] . IL-10 can activate NK cells and de-activate macrophages. HMOX1 is the major downstream effector molecule to mediate IL-10 inhibition of macrophages. HMOX1 was up-regulated after malaria. HMOX1 generates CO molecule to mediate anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages, which is opposite to nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), which generates NO molecule to cause inflammatory effects. Argininesuccinate synthetase (ASS) is the ratelimiting enzyme to synthesize arginine, the substrate of iNOS. iNOS is the central mediator representing macrophage classical activation, and unchanged ASS and iNOS express levels support the notion that macrophages are not being activated after malaria infection. In the study, macrophages were inhibited rather than activated after malaria. In summary, many elements of TH1 immune response were up-regulated following infection with P. falciparum, including: interferon alpha/beta inducible genes, interferon gamma inducible genes, NK cell-related genes (NK cell cytotoxicity), ADCC-related genes, TH1 chemokines, and CD8 T cell-related genes.

TLR7/8 binding to single strand RNA mainly induce anti-virus TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response. In addition, this study found a lot of heat shock proteins are up-regulated after malarial infection. Heat shock proteins, mainly HSP60 or HSP70, can activate TLR2/4 for inducing TH17 immune response. In this study, TGF-\u03b2, IL-1, and IL-8 were strongly up-regulated in acute malaria (Table 3) .

Up-regulated TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, or TNF are associated with a higher frequency of malaria complications and an overall poor malaria prognosis. A previous study revealed that neutrophil-related genes were up-regulated in children after acute P. falciparum malaria infection [14] .

Neutrophilia has been observed in falciparum malaria, and elevated white blood cell counts are associated with severe malaria [15] . Gene network analysis of TGFB1/IL-6 or IL-17related gene expression after malaria infection also suggested that malaria was TH17 dependent. Falciparum malaria often causes complications such as acute renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil over-activation in TH17 immune response is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria, acute renal failure, and ARDS [16] [17] [18] .

Active immunosuppression is well documented during malaria infection in mice [3] . IL-12 expression is down-regulated in this model [23] . According to an IRF1 knock-out study, mice can initiate TH1 immune response by bypassing the need for IL-12 production through the use of an alternate interferon alpha/ beta driven pathway [24] . Based on recent microarray studies in malaria-infected mice, there is no evidence of IL-12 up-regulation following infection. Instead, interferon alpha/beta and its related genes were found to be significantly up-regulated [25, 26] , thus providing further evidence at the gene level that interferon alpha/beta can substitute for IL-12 in the induction of malaria-specific interferon gamma TH1 type immune response after infection in rodents. However, the IFN\u03b1\u03b2 driven TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response only can produce mid-to-moderate IFNg, and IL-10, the main effector molecule in TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response, antagonizes the effect of IFNg upon macrophages.

In the present study, this study found that a number of genes involved in the NK cell proliferation were up-regulated over the course of the malaria disease cycle (Table 1 ). In addition, as in the mouse model, genes associated with macrophage proliferation were not up-regulated following infection with P. falciparum. Increased NK cell populations have also been reported previously in acute malaria infection [31, 32] , thus, it appears that the interferon alpha/ beta-NK cell pathway of TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response is preferentially enhanced after P. falciparum infection, while the IL-12 driven pathway appears unaffected.

In previous microarray analysis of human malarial infection, interferon inducible genes were upregulated with unchanged IL-12 expression [14, 35] . Other important components of TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response included up-regulation of HMOX1, FAS, BCL6, TNFRSF10A, and MIP1\u03b1 were noted in Griffiths' research [14] , which studied the peripheral blood leukocytes from Kenyan children with acute falciparum malaria.

When given alone and prior to malaria infection, IL-12 can provide 100% protection against experimental Plasmodium infection through the activation of macrophages, which help to control the liver stage of infection [1] .
