However, the association of TTR on admission and over time on outcomes has not yet been prospectively assessed in trauma patients. Methods This is a prospective observational study including trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a large Level I trauma center 05/2014-05/2015. TTR levels at ICU admission and all subsequent values over time were recorded. Patients were observed for 28 days or until hospital discharge. The association of outcomes and TTR levels at admission and over time was assessed using multivariable regression and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis, respectively. Results A total of 237 patients with TTR obtained at admission were included, 69 of whom had repeated TTR measurements. Median age was 40.0 years and median ISS 16.0; 83.1% were male. Below-normal TTR levels at admission (41.8%) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (p = 0.042), more infectious complications (p = 0.032), longer total hospital length of stay (LOS) (p = 0.013), and ICU LOS (p = 0.041). Higher TTR levels over time were independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality (p = 0.015), fewer infections complications (p = 0.028), shorter total hospital and ICU LOS (both p \\ 0.001), and fewer ventilator days (0.004). Conclusions In critically ill trauma patients, below-normal TTR levels at admission were independently associated with worse outcomes and higher TTR levels over time with better outcomes, including lower in-hospital mortality, less infectious complications, shorter total hospital and ICU LOS, and fewer ventilator days.

We have previously published a retrospective study that revealed lower TTR levels at ICU admission as an independent predictor for worse outcomes in trauma patients [18] . The current prospective study confirmed this finding. TTR by itself is not known to have an impact on outcomes in critically ill patients. However, as it is affected by both the inflammatory response after trauma [13, 15] and the nutritional state [12] [13] [14] , TTR can be looked at as a surrogate parameter for the overall clinical condition in critically ill patients that may be used as a marker for outcomes. Higher TTR levels over time reflect a decreasing inflammatory response and adequate nutrition and therefore better outcomes. On the other hand, decreasing TTR levels over time may indicate both, an ongoing inflammatory state, e.g., due to multiple surgical procedures or complications, and inadequate nutritional support.

In the study by Parent et al., patients who required less than 2 days of mechanical ventilation and less than 7 days of ICU care, as well as patients who were expected to die during the first 2 days after admission, were excluded. Consequently, the ICU and total hospital LOS were much longer in the study by Parent et al. than in the current study (14 vs. 4 and 26 vs. 10, respectively).

Although TTR levels are affected not only by nutrition, but also by the inflammatory state [27] , persistently low TTR levels, especially in the absence of ongoing surgical procedures, may indicate an insufficient nutritional supply and therefore increased infectious complications. Consequently, adequate nutrition is crucial to avoid infectious complications and may be monitored using TTR over time. CRP levels significantly increased over time in the current study.

TTR measurements were more frequently ordered in male patients and patients with penetrating injuries, more severe trauma, and a longer hospital LOS. The current study has some inherent limitations. As the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU with TTR measurements was relatively small and baseline characteristics of the patients included in the study and all other trauma patients admitted to the ICU during the study period were different, the results may not be valid for critically ill trauma patients in general.
