Objectives: To molecularly characterise a novel HRV and determine its prevalence and clinical impact on a predominantly paediatric population. Study design: Nucleotide sequencing was employed to determine the complete HRV-QPM coding sequence. Two novel real-time RT-PCR diagnostic assays were designed and employed to retrospectively screen a well-defined population of 1244 specimen extracts to identify the prevalence of HRV-QPM during 2003. Results: Phylogenetic studies of complete coding sequences defined HRV-QPM as a novel member the genus Rhinovirus residing within the previously described HRV-A2 sub-lineage. Investigation of the relatively short VP1 sequence suggest that the virus is resistant to Pleconaril, setting it apart from the HRV A species. Sixteen additional HRV-QPM strains were detected (1.4% of specimens) often as the sole microorganism present among infants with suspected bronchiolitis. HRV-QPM was also detected in Europe during 2006, and a closely related virus circulated in the United States during 2004.
