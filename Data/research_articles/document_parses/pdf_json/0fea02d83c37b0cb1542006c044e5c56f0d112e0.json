In the present paper we focus on the subreducts of quasi-Nelson algebras obtained by eliding the implication while keeping the two term-definable negations. These form a variety that (following A. Sendlewski, who studied the corresponding fragment of Nelson algebras) we dub weakly pseudocomplemented quasi-Kleene algebras. We develop a Priestley-style duality for these algebras (in two different guises) which is essentially an application of the general approach proposed in the paper A duality for two-sorted lattices by A. Jung and U. Rivieccio.",

The algebraic models of N form the variety of Nelson algebras (alias Nelson residuated lattices), and have been studied since the late 1950's (first by Rasiowa; see [14] and references therein). One of the main algebraic insights on this variety is that every Nelson algebra can be represented as a special binary power (here called a twist-algebra) of a Heyting algebra. This correspondence was formulated as a categorical equivalence (first by A. Sendlewski) between Nelson algebras and a category of enriched Heyting algebras, and this made it possible to transfer a number of fundamental results from the theory of Heyting algebras to the Nelson realm.",

This entails that the class of Nelson algebras is term equivalent to a variety of bounded, commutative, integral residuated lattices [4] ; hence the alternative name of Nelson residuated lattices. Given the recent flourish of studies on substructural logics and residuated structures, this alternative perspective also proved fruitful. Indeed, it made it possible, in the first place, to recover or recast a number of results on Nelson algebras by specialising more general ones about residuated structures. Furthermore, and maybe more interestingly, it allows us to formulate new questions on Nelson algebras/logic that can be best appreciated within the framework of residuated lattices. Among these is the problem that led to the introduction of quasi-Nelson algebras, which can be phrased as follows.",

It turns out that some of the most characteristic results indeed do not depend on the involutive law. In particular, it is shown in [17, 18] that (a suitable generalisation of) the twist-algebra construction can be performed in a not-necessarily involutive context: thus making it possible to recover the connection between Heyting algebras and 'non-involutive Nelson algebras', a variety we dubbed quasi-Nelson algebras (alias quasi-Nelson residuated lattices). This class can also be characterised by a purely congruence-theoretical property introduced in [22] under the name of (0, 1)-congruence orderability; the main result being that among (bounded, commutative, integral) residuated lattices, quasi-Nelson algebras are precisely the (0, 1)-congruence orderable ones.

The weak implication is indeed a genuine implication; it is, in fact, the connective that gives (quasi-)Nelson logic a classical deduction-detachment theorem [9, Thm. 2] . As such, the weak implication can be used to introduce an alternative negation \u00ac (distinct from \u223c) given by the term \u00acx := x \u2192 0. This observation led Sendlewski [21] to the study of weakly pseudo-complemented Kleene algebras, alias the {\u2227, \u2228, \u223c, \u00ac, 0, 1}subreducts of Nelson algebras. The {\u2227, \u2228, \u223c, \u00ac, 0, 1}-subreducts of quasi-Nelson algebras are characterised in [15] , and the corresponding variety dubbed weakly pseudo-complemented quasi-Kleene algebras.

The resulting ordered topological structures are called Priestley spaces 1 . A homomorphism h between bounded distributive lattices L and L gives rise to a function X(h) : X(L ) \u2192 X(L), defined by X(h)(P ) = h \u22121 [P ], that is continuous and order preserving. Taking functions with these properties (called Priestley functions) as morphisms between Priestley spaces, one obtains the category PrSp, and X is a contravariant functor from D to PrSp. For a functor in the opposite direction, one associates to every Priestley space X = X, \u03c4, \u2264 the set L(X) of clopen up-sets. This is a bounded distributive lattice with respect to the set-theoretic operations \u2229, \u222a, \u2205, and X.

Relying on Theorem 4, we can proceed in parallel to Sect. 3. Definition 12. Let NP be the category whose objects are tuples L = L, \u2207 , with L an np-lattice and \u2207 \u2286 L a dense filter.

Conversely, for every WPQK-algebra A, let K(A) := A + , , \u2207 A . For a WPQK-homomorphism k : A \u2192 A , let K(k) : K(A) \u2192 K(A ) be defined by setting K(k)([a]) := [k(a)] for every a \u2208 A.",

The functors H, K establish a co-variant equivalence between NP and WPQK. Proof. We prove first that H is a functor. Let L = L, \u2207 and L = L , \u2207 be two objects in NP and h : L \u2192 L a NP-morphism. The proof that H(h) : H(L) \u2192 H(L ) is a WPQK-homomorphism is similar to the proof above for morphsims in TW and the functor F , because H(L) = T w L, L , , Id L , \u2207 and H(L ) = T w L , L , , Id L , \u2207 . Given A, A objects in WPQK and k : A \u2192 A a WPQK-homomorphism, we shall prove that K(k) : K(A) \u2192 K(A ) is a NP-morphism. Since k is a morphism of WPQK algebras, it easily follows that K(k) is a homomorphism from A + , to A + , . Let a, b \u2208 A. Then: K(k)([a] \u2227 [b]) = K(k)([a \u2227 b]) = ([k(a \u2227 b)]) = ([k(a) \u2227 k(b)]) = [k(a)] \u2227 [k(b)] = K(k)([a]) \u2227 K(k)([b]),",
