Recent findings suggest that the five factors of the CSS form a COVID Stress Syndrome (Taylor et al., 2020b) . In the general population each of these factors can contribute to increased substance use and abuse risk .

This constellation of stressors warrants unique programs of intervention to manage drug use and abuse. Research to develop such programs is needed, particularly in consideration of the broad impact of COVID-19.
