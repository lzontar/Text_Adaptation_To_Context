            "text": "Although bats are increasingly becoming the focus of scientific studies due to their unique properties, these exceptional animals are still among the least studied mammals. Assembly quality and completeness of bat genomes vary a lot and especially noncoding RNA (ncRNA) annotations are incomplete or simply missing. Accordingly, standard bioinformatics pipelines for gene expression analysis often ignore ncRNAs such as microRNAs or long antisense RNAs. The main cause of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotations. We present a complete screening for ncRNAs within 16 bat genomes. NcRNAs affect a remarkable variety of vital biological functions, including gene expression regulation, RNA processing, RNA interference and, as recently described, regulatory processes in viral infections. Within all investigated bat assemblies, we annotated 667 ncRNA families including 162 snoRNAs and 193 miRNAs as well as rRNAs, tRNAs, several snRNAs and lncRNAs, and other structural ncRNA elements. We validated our ncRNA candidates by six RNA-Seq data sets and show significant expression patterns that have never been described before in a bat species on such a large scale. Our annotations will be usable as a resource (rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/ bats) for deeper studying of bat evolution, ncRNAs repertoire, gene expression and regulation, ecology and important host-virus interactions.",

For example, bats are the suspected reservoirs for some of the deadliest viral diseases such as Ebola and SARS (12) (13) (14) , but appear to be asymptomatic and survive the infection. Possibly, the solution to better understand and fight these pathogens lies in the uniquely developed immune system of bats (15, 16) . Studying bats and their genomes is likely to have high impacts on various sci- Figure 1 .

If multiple entries for one species were available, an average over all C-values was calculated and used to estimate the genome size.

If suitable, the appropriate strand-specific counting mode was applied for each data set (see Table 2 for information about the strand specificity). For each bat genome assembly, the merged annotation of already known (NCBI) and newly identified (this study) ncR-NAs was used (Supplementary Files S1).

We used the Gorap pipeline (https://github.com/koriege/gorap), a specially developed software suite for genome-wide ncRNA screening. Gorap screens genomic sequences for all ncRNAs present in the Rfam database using a generalized strategy by applying multiple filters and specialized software tools. To this end, Gorap takes huge advantage of Infernal (41,42) (v1.1.2) to annotate ncRNAs based on input alignment files conserved in sequence and secondary structure (so-called Stockholm alignment files; stk). All resulting alignment files were automatically pre-filtered by Gorap based on different ncRNA class-specific parameters including taxonomy, secondary structure and primary sequence comparisons. Due to repeats, pseudogenes, undiscriminable un-/functional genes and overlapping results from the different assembly methods, we defined a ncRNA set per species for annotation that includes filtered sequences, but allows for variants and multiple copies. This final annotation set is defined by hand-curating the resulting stk alignments of Gorap with the help of Emacs RALEE mode (43) . Due to the removal of sequences in the stockholm alignments, the remaining sequences were extracted and again aligned into stockholm format using cmalign --noprob from Infernal. The Rfam-derived ncRNA alignments were further split into snoRNAs (Supplementary Table S5 ), miRNAs (Supplementary Table S6 ) and other ncRNAs including snRNAs, lncRNAs and other structural RNAs (Supplementary Table S8 ).",

For reference mapping, Huang et al. also used the M. lucifugus genome, so we were theoretically able to directly compare our annotations with the annotations of both studies. Unfortunately, no positional information (annotation file) of the identified miRNAs derived from the transcriptomic data of M. myotis were given in the manuscript or supplement (8) . Therefore, we blasted the precursor miRNA sequences identified with the help of the M. myotis transcriptome against the M. lucifugus genome and retained only hits with a sequence identity of 100%. The so obtained positional information was further used to calculate the overlap between our predicted miRNAs in M. lucifugus. We used the same approach for the P. alecto comparison. If the annotated location of an miRNA and one of our identified miRNA locations in M. lucifugus/P.alecto were overlapping by at least 85 %, we counted this location as a common prediction.",

The transcripts were used as input for a BLASTn (2.7.1+, 1e \u221210 ) search against each of the 16 bat assemblies (compiled as BLAST databases). The BLASTn result for each bat assembly was further processed to group single hits into potential transcripts as follows: first, for each query sequence q \u2208 H, hits of q found on the same contig c and strand s were selected (hits c, s, q ) and the longest one, q 1 , was chosen as a starting point so that trscp c, s, q = (q 1 ). Second, all hits q i \u2208 hits c, s, q with q i \u2208trscp c, s, q , which overlap neither in the query q nor in the target sequence and do not exceed a maximum range of 500 000 nt from the most upstream to the most down-stream target sequence position of all q j \u2208 trscp c, s, q \u222aq i , were added iteratively to trscp c, s, q . To this end, we introduced a simple model of exon-intron structures, naturally occurring when using transcript sequences as queries against a target genome assembly. We defined the 500 000 nt search range based on an estimation of lncRNA gene sizes derived from the human Ensembl (37) annotation. If the sum of the lengths of all q i \u2208 trscp c, s, q covers the query transcript length length q at least for 70 %, trscp c, s, q was considered as a transcript and its elements q i as exons, otherwise all q i \u2208 trscp c, s, q were withdrawn. This procedure is repeated until all hits \u2208 hits c, s, q were used or withdrawn. Therefore, each so-defined group of non-overlapping hits derived from the same query sequence and found on the same contig and strand should represent a lncRNA transcript with its (rough) exon structure. The defined transcripts were saved as BLAST-like output and transformed into GTF file format. To follow the GTF annotation format and to harmonize our lncRNA annotations with the other ncRNA annotations, each lncRNA transcript was also saved as a gene annotation and consists of at least one exon.",

In the case of multiple exons, groups of exons were merged, if they shared any transcript origin. If all exons in the group originated from the same LNCipedia gene, the group was considered as one gene with several transcripts and its associated exon(s). Otherwise, we defined a lncRNA hot spot on gene level with several transcripts and their associated exon(s).

For EHE, we found a possible mtDNA contig in full-length (16 141 nt; AWHC01200796) in the genome assembly. Due to the circularization of mtDNA, we rearranged the sequence of this contig to start with the gene coding for the phenylalanin tRNA and to match the gene order of the other mitochondrial genomes.

Whereas the first complex eukaryotic genomes were generated using Sanger chemistry, today's technologies such as Illumina short-read sequencing and PacBio or Oxford Nanopore long-read approaches are increasingly used (50) . The currently available bat genomes vary widely regarding their assembly quality and completeness (Table 1 and Figure 2 ; Supplementary Table S1 ) and were predominantly assembled by using short Illumina-derived reads and low (\u223c18 X) (51) up to moderate/higher coverage (77-218 X) approaches (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) 25) . A new assembly of the cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea) (57) was exclusively generated from long-read data derived from the PacBio platform, and the genome of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) (58) was assembled by using a hybrid-approach of Illumina and PacBio Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1) Supplementary Table S9. data. These two genomes from the Pteropodidae family are of a generally higher quality (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S1 ). Regardless of their assembly quality, these genomes need to be annotated to identify regions of interest, for example, encoding for protein-and non-coding genes or other regulatory elements.",

Accordingly, the available bat genome annotations vary a lot regarding their quality, ranging from more comprehensive annotations for longstanding bat genomes such as M. lucifugus or P. vampyrus to annotations on region level, completely missing any coding or non-coding gene annotations at the current NCBI version ( Figure 3 and Table 4 ). Furthermore, by using strandspecific RNA-Seq data, we could show that some genes (e.g. IFNA5/IFNW2 in the Ensembl annotation of M. lucifugus (26) ) are annotated on the wrong strand and are therefore entirely missed by differential expression studies when relying on a strand-specific read quantification. For all publicly available bat genomes, ncRNAs are generally annotated on low levels and are highly incomplete, mostly only comprising some tRNAs, rRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs and lncRNAs ( Figure 3 and Table 4 ). Therefore, many ncRNAs, especially miRNAs, are simply overlooked by current molecular studies, for example from RNA-Seq studies that aim to call differential expressed genes based on such in-complete genome annotation files. Studies that have made additional effort on annotating ncRNAs in bats (8, 25, 47, (60) (61) are not reporting their results on a level that can be directly used for further computational assessment (e.g. as a direct input for RNA-Seq abundance estimation). Currently, in the NCBI database, five bat assemblies are entirely lacking any coding/non-coding annotations and miRNAs are not annotated at all ( Table 4 ). The Rfam database (39) contains mainly for M. lucifugus and P. vampyrus 336 ncRNA families. Other ncRNAs are currently unknown from bat genomes or not well documented.",

Note that we refer throughout this paper to an RNA-Seq data set by the first author's name and the year of the respective data set publication. The only included data set derived from a species of the Yinpterochiroptera suborder (R. aegyptiacus) was obtained from a study dealing with the differential transcriptional responses of Ebola and Marburg virus infections in human and bat cells (16) (data set: H\u00f6lzer-2016) . In this study, total RNA of nine samples of R06E-J cells, either challenged by the Ebola or Marburg virus or left un-infected, were harvested at 3, 7 or 23 h post infection (poi) and sequenced. Unfortunately, no biological replicates could be generated for this study. Therefore, we did not use this data set for the differential ex-pression analysis, but also calculated normalized expression values (TPM; transcripts per million) as done for all RNA-Seq data sets. The other five data sets comprise Yangochiroptera species of the Vespertilionidae (M. lucifugus, M. daubentonii) and Miniopteridae (M. natalensis) families (Table 2 ). Field et al. conducted two transcriptomic studies (27, 28) (Field-2015 , Field-2018 using wing tissue of the hibernating little brown myotis bat. They were especially interested in transcriptional changes between un-infected wing tissue and adjacent tissue infected with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungal pathogen that causes the white-nose syndrome. Two other data sets were obtained from virus-(RVFV Clone 13) and interferon (IFN) alphainduced transcriptomes of a Myotis daubentonii kidney cell line (MyDauNi/2c). RNA of mock, IFN and Clone 13 samples were gathered at two time points, 6 and 24 h poi (26) . From the same samples, rRNA-depleted (H\u00f6lzer-2019) and smallRNA-concentrated (Weber-2019; see Methods section for details) libraries were generated and sequenced. Finally, we used data of the long-fingered bat M. natalensis initially obtained to characterize the developing bat wing (25) . Here, total RNA was extracted from paired forelimbs and hindlimbs from three individuals at three developmental stage.",

In general, replicates of virus-infected and IFN-treated samples 24 h post infection tend to cluster together only based on the expression profiles of small ncRNAs (mainly miRNAs) ( Figure 4A and B) . Most differences can be observed between the 24 h virus-infected and all other samples, which seem to show no clearly distinguishable expression pattern. Interestingly, at 6 h post infection, we see replicates clustering together regardless of their treatment (mock, IFN, Clone 13). Thus, after only 6 h, few miRNAs are differentially expressed and therefore the samples of each replicate (mock, IFN, Clone 13) cluster together, because they have the same passaging history but the passaging history in between the replicates differ (26) . After 24 h, more and more miRNAs are significantly differentially expressed and the samples can be better distinguished based on their treatment ( Figure 4A and B). We observed that, in general, miRNAs tend to be down-regulated ( Figure 4B ; upper half), while snoRNAs tend to be up-regulated (lower half) after 24 h of Clone 13 infection compared to mock. For example, we found a novel miRNA (MLUGD00000002094 in our annotation; predicted by mirDeep2; Supplementary  Table S7 ) located in an intron of the protein-coding gene SEMA3G, significantly down-regulated (log 2 fc = -2.56) during Clone 13 infection ( Figure 4C and D) . Based on Rfam alignments we further found a histone 3'-UTR stemloop (RF00032), an RNA element involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of the histone mRNAs, significantly down-regulated during infection.",

(A) A PCA performed by PCAGO (https://github.com/hoelzer-lab/pcago) using the 150 most highly expressed ncRNAs (75 miRNAs, 56 snoRNAs, 10 tRNAs, 9 other small ncRNAs; discarding rRNAs) as input. As also shown in the heat map (B), replicates tend to cluster on the basis of their passaging history, except for virus-and interferon-treated (IFN) samples 24 h post infection. (B) A heat map and hierarchical clustering for the same 150 most highly expressed ncRNAs that were used for PCA (A). The clustering was performed on DESeq2-normalized read counts and scaled on rows to visualize changes in expression on ncRNA level. Most differences can be observed between the Clone 13-infected samples 24 h post infection and all other conditions. Due to minor changes in miRNA expression levels, the other samples tend to cluster on the basis of their passaging history and not on the basis of their treatment. In general, miRNAs tend to be down-regulated (upper half), while snoRNAs tend to be up-regulated (lower half) after 24 h of Clone 13 infection. (C) Selected expression box plots of four highly expressed ncRNAs. Shown are DESeq2-normalized expression counts. The miRNA mir-1307 and a novel mirDeep2-predicted miRNA are significantly (adjusted p-value < 0.05) down-regulated at 24 h post virus infection. The C/D box snoRNA SNORD62 and a Y RNA are up-regulated.

From these 490 and 368 miRNAs, our prediction, based on the transcriptome of M. daubentonii (Weber-2019) mapped to M. lucifugus and P. alecto, included 195/490 (39.8 %) and 182/368 (49.5 %) miRNAs.",
