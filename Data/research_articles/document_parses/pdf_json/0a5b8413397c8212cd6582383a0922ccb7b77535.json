To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compares the clinical manifestation according to the presence of immunosuppression, and we observed that, although the clinical symptoms and signs were very similar, laboratory disturbances such as neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and renal insufficiency were more frequent in the ISP. Some of these, such as renal insufficiency or anemia, were present before the influenza episode and are probably related to the underlying disease and therapy of the ISP, while others, such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia, significantly worsen after influenza infection, possibly due to an effect of the viral infection in this type of patient.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 235, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 236, "end": 239, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 240, "end": 243, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 258, "end": 262, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 587, "end": 590, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 591, "end": 593, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 868, "end": 872, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 889, "end": 893, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1219, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In ISP, respiratory viruses lead to prolonged clinical courses, with the risk of progression of the infection to the lower respiratory tract and increased mortality when compared to the immunocompetent population [2, 18] . The severity of seasonal influenza in ISP is variable according to the different studies published. Ljungman et al. [1] , in a series of ISP with seasonal influenza, observed that most of the cases were mild. Schnell et al. [3] , in a retrospective study of hospitalized ISP with seasonal influenza, reported that one-half of the patients had a pneumonia and one-third of patients were admitted to the ICU, with a 10% mortality rate. Other studies carried out in ISP with seasonal influenza report a mortality rate ranging from 0 to 25% [1, 8, 19] . Severe influenza A H1N1 infection has been associated with IgG 2 deficiency [20] . In the present study, although there were no differences in some outcome variables, such as admission to ICUs, progression to lower respiratory tract or septic shock, the risk of death during the influenza episode was four times higher in the ISP. However, the severity and outcome of the infection deferred according to the degree of immunosuppression: patients with corticosteroid therapy presented less frequently analytical disturbances and complicated diseases with a better outcome, while oncohematological patients had higher mortality, especially those profoundly neutropenic. The impact of corticosteroids on influenza severity and outcome are conflicting, since there are no randomized trials assessing this effect. High-dose steroids may prolong viral shedding in HSCT recipients [8, 21] and increase the risk of lower respiratory tract diseases in pediatric cancer patients. But in other studies, it has been suggested that progression to lower respiratory tract diseases may be reduced or not affected [8, 21] .
