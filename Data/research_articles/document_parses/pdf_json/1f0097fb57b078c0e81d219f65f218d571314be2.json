This antiviral activity mainly depends on A3G incorporation into viral particles. However, the mechanisms of A3G packaging into HBV particles have not been well characterized. In this paper, we demonstrated that A3G interacted with the HBV core protein (HBc) directly in co-transfected HepG2 cells using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach. In addition, we further found that this interaction did not require other factors in vitro using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology on BIAcore 3000. While cellular RNA or viral RNA was added to A3G protein solution before flow through the BIAcore chip, the interaction was not affected. In conclusion, these results suggest the possibility that A3G is incorporated into HBV viral particles via direct binding with HBc protein.",

            "text": "Cellular APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1-like) is a family of cellular cytidine deaminase-editing enzymes, including APOBEC1, APOBEC2, seven APOBEC3 variants and activation-induced deaminase (Aguiar and Peterlin, 2008; Jarmuz et al., 2002; Wedekind et al., 2003) . APOBEC3G (A3G) belongs to this family and has potent antiretroviral activity (Mangeat et al., 2003; Turelli et al., 2004; Wang and Wang, 2009 ). A3G contains a duplication of the conserved HXEX23-28-CPX2-4C motif, wherein the N-terminal domain probably has an ability to bind to RNA, while the C-terminal domain possesses cytidine deamination activity (Chiu and Greene, 2008) . Previous studies have suggested that the deamination of cytidine to uridine in nascent minus-strand transcripts during reverse transcription is the most important reason for A3G's antiviral effects (Harris et al., 2003; Mangeat et al., 2003) . However, recent data have shown that A3G can inhibit HBV replication in a deaminaseindependent way (Nguyen et al., 2007; Turelli et al., 2004) . In the absence of viral infectivity factor (Vif), A3G is specifically incorporated into the assembling HIV-1 virions, reducing the infectivity of the newly produced virus (Alce and Popik, 2004) . It is also incorporated into murine leukemia viruses and coronaviruses (Wang and Wang, 2009; Zhang et al., 2008) . The mechanism of A3G incorporating into HIV-1 virons may be through interaction with HIV-1 Gag (Cen et al., 2004; Douaisi et al., 2004) . Recently, some reports pointed out that A3G virion recruitment by Gag/NC is RNAdependent (Burnett and Spearman, 2007; Wang et al., 2008b) , while others believed that it was RNA-independent (Alce and Popik, 2004; Soros et al., 2007) . Whether cellular RNA or viral genomic RNA plays a role in the virion packaging of A3G remains to be determined.",

During HBV infection, the relaxed circular (RC)-DNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which acts as the template for transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and antigen-coding mRNAs. pgRNA is the template for reverse transcription and specifies the codes for the HBV core protein (HBc) and the HBV polymerase. HBc is the major component of the nucleocapsid shell packaging the HBV genome. Furthermore, it plays an essential role in the formation of HBV replication complexes (Guarnieri et al., 2006) . Baumert et al. (2007) mentioned that A3G did not affect the early steps of the HBV life cycle, but it may interfere with the packaging of HBV.

YFP was then selectively photobleached in the defined region of the cell. A second set of images was then obtained using the same conditions prior to photobleaching. The increase in CFP fluorescence after YFP photobleaching corresponds to the original amount of energy transferred from CFP to YFP; thus, the difference in CFP fluorescence before and after photobleaching corresponds to the level of FRET.

As expected, neither CFP nor YFP can be excited by 500 or 430 nm wavelength lights, but there was some signal in the FRET filter set (due to bleed-through of CFP/YFP). We removed this part of the signal in carrying out FRET calculations. To ensure the reliability of our recording system, we carried out some control experiments. First, cells co-expressing CFP and YFP that served as a negative control, and no FRET signal was observed (FR = 0.97 \u00b1 0.02, n = 32). On the other hand, cells expressing the CFP-YFP concatemer, which served as a positive control, showed a significant FRET signal (FR = 5.47 \u00b1 0.05, n = 49) (Fig. 2) . Therefore, these control experiments verified that three-cube FRET provides sensitive and selective detection of FRET. Then we tested the interaction between A3G and HBc using the same system described above. We found that the FRET signal was produced from co-expression of A3G-CFP and HBc-YFP (FR = 1.68 \u00b1 0.04, n = 52). We also co-transfected pA3G-CFP with pEYFP-N1 in HepG2 cells as a negative control. The FR value was 0.99 \u00b1 0.01 (n = 61), similar to the result from the negative control. These results suggested that there was an interaction between A3G and HBc in living cells.",

In order to answer this question, the direct interaction between A3G and HBc was first tested by SPR assay. Usually, HBc assembles into small and large icosahedral particles, so here we constructed an assembly defective mutant (pHBc-Y132A-HA) (Bourne et al., 2009) . Proteins A3G-HA and HBc-Y132A-HA were purified by anti-HA antibodyconjugated agarose beads. As shown in Fig. 4A , there were no significant signals generated between the HBc-Y132A-HA and HApeptide or the PGRN protein, while the interaction between A3G protein and HBc-Y132A-HA was detected. In order to examine the role of RNA in the interaction between them, we added the total RNA of HepG2 cells or HepG2.2.15 cells to the A3G protein solution before SPR analysis. As shown in Fig. 4B , the signal obtained from A3G and HBc-Y132A-HA was not affected when RNA of HepG2 or HepG2.2.15 cells was added. This suggested that RNA did not play a role in stabilizing the interaction.",

However, how A3G is specifically packaged into HBV particle requires further investigation. By confocal fluorescence microscopy, we detected that A3G and HBc extensively co-localized in HepG2 cells. This suggested that A3G may interact with HBc in cytoplasm. To directly determine the interaction between them, we used both three-cube FRET measurement and acceptor photobleaching. The FRET signal was observed between A3G-CFP and HBc-YFP in HepG2 cells, and our findings strongly demonstrated that A3G can bind to HBc in the cytoplasm.",

Whether other cellular factors are required for the interaction between A3G and HBc protein remains unknown. The SPR approach is ideally suitable to study the protein-protein interaction in vitro and the possible effects of other cellular components can be eliminated (Nakajima et al., 2005) . In this study, we first used the SPR approach and found direct physical interaction between HBc and A3G proteins in cell free systems. Cen et al. (2004) demonstrated that A3G binds to the HIV-1 Gag, but they also demonstrated that Gag/APOBEC3G complex is immunoprecipitated from cell lysate after RNase treatment. So we questioned whether HBV RNA or cellular RNA benefited from the interaction between A3G and HBc. We again used SPR to detect this relationship and certified that this binding was enhanced by neither the HepG2 cell RNA nor the HepG2.2.15 cell RNA. A possibility exists that the interaction is not dependent on RNA. These results are consistent with reports that the interaction between A3G and HIV-1 Gag is RNA-independent (Soros et al., 2007) .",

HBc can directly incorporate into the viral core that becomes the nucleus for reverse transcription upon infection of a cell. Schlicht et al. (1989) reported that the deletion of 36 amino acids from the carboxy terminus of the duck HBc abolished genome replication, although mutant cores formed capsid particles competent for genome packaging. Mutant proteins truncated to amino acid 163 or 164 packaged RNA but drastically reduced DNA synthesis (Nassal, 1992) . These observations suggest that interactions with the HBc proteins can affect several steps in genome replication. Here we used different methods and certified that A3G can directly interact with HBc. This reveals that one of the mechanisms of A3G suppressing HBV DNA synthesis may be through binding core proteins directly.",
