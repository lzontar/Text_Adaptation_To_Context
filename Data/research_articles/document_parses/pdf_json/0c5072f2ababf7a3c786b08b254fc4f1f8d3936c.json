The diagnostic value of LUS in the workup of coronavirus disease-19 in the hospital setting is still uncertain. Objectives: The aim of this observational study was to explore correlations of the LUS appearance of COVID-19-related pneumonia with CT findings. Methods: Twenty-six patients (14 males, age 64 \u00b1 16 years) urgently hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, who underwent chest CT and bedside LUS on the day of admission, were enrolled in this observational study. CT images were reviewed by expert chest radiologists, who calculated a visual CT score based on extension and distribution of ground-glass opacities and consolidations. LUS was performed by clinicians with certified competency in thoracic ultrasonography, blind to CT findings, following a systematic approach recommended by ultrasound guidelines. LUS score was calculated according to presence, distribution, and severity of abnormalities. Results: All participants had CT findings suggestive of bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, with an average visual scoring of 43 \u00b1 24%. LUS identified 4 different possible abnormalities, with bilateral distribution (average LUS score 15 \u00b1 5): focal areas of nonconfluent B lines, diffuse confluent B lines, small subpleural microconsolidations with pleural line irregularities, and large parenchymal consolidations with air bronchograms. LUS score was significantly correlated with CT visual scoring (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) and oxygen saturation in room air (r = -0.66, p < 0.001).
