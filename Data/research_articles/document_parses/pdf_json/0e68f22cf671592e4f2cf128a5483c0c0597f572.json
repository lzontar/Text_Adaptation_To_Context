These events were defined as per guideline criteria [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , and were further adjudicated in weekly meetings by a group of study physicians and coordinators.

            "text": "Longer LOS, sicker patients, lower GCS, and surgical interventions are all risk factors for infections. Subsequently, investigating the relationship between infection and VTE is complicated, as both disease severity [12] and LOS [13] are individually associated with both infection and VTE. We included LOS and markers of disease severity (ICH score) as an adjustment variable in our regression model to account for these factors. It is worth noting that there were no differences in times to pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis between groups. And in parallel, the vast majority of patients who developed DVT encountered this complication outcome after the initiation of pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis. Our median [IQR] days to initiation of DVT prophylaxis was 3 [2] [3] [4] days and most likely reflects our center's practice of initiating DVT prophylaxis 24-48 h from hemorrhage stability on follow-up imaging. Assessment for hematoma expansion was beyond the scope of this study, but with longer times to image stability, one might hypothesize that these patients had a higher than expected time to stability. Further studies are in order to determine the biologic association between hematoma expansion and increased thrombotic risk. While the longer LOS in more severe ICH patients likely contributes to increased opportunities for nosocomial infections, more severe ICH patients are also at increased risk for infection such as pneumonia in the setting of aspiration. While we attempted to control for admission clinical severity scores and LOS in our model to determine independent association between infection and subsequent DVT/PE event, it is possible that our findings may reflect the known relationship that more severe ICH injury has with greater risk for infection during hospitalization [12] .",

            "text": "If there is indeed a relationship of infection with VTE independent of clinical severity and LOS, the mechanism for this association is uncertain. It could be a marker of underlying medical illness or a marker of the proinflammatory cascade leading to downstream endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis risk. It is known that both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke induce local inflammation [10, 11, 27] , and it is possible that subsequent infection further triggers inflammatory responses, leading to excessive activation of coagulation [9, 28] and impairment of fibrinolysis [29] resulting in massive thrombin formation and fibrin deposition [8] and microvascular thrombosis. Infection, and notably sepsis, induces a marked pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic systemic environment [28] . These inflammatory Time to first administration of DVT Prophylaxis, median days (IQR) mechanisms might explain the higher incidence of VTE in patients admitted with sepsis despite receiving guideline-recommended VTE prophylaxis [7] . Though our study strengths include prospectively collected data, consensus adjudication of complications (both infection and VTE), and a single-center cohort that uses a relatively homogenous diagnostic and treatment protocol for ICH and its complications, there are several notable limitations worth mentioning. The generalizability of the findings is limited given the single-center cohort and low numbers of VTEs in this study. The retrospective analysis created some limitation in accounting completely for comorbidities not initially collected. This study was also limited by the inclusion of only symptomatic VTE. Future studies that screen for both infection and VTE in all patients should be considered in order to identify and clarify the biologic link between infection and VTE. Additionally, the timing data regarding both infection and VTE onset were difficult to determine with certainty. Thus, the chronology between infection and VTE is somewhat speculative; however, the adjudication of hospital complications by group consensus helped mitigate this limitation. Furthermore, while the use of the date of diagnosis of infection and VTE rather than date of clinical suspicion may be seen as a limitation, using the latter would have most likely resulted in a shortened time to event and would most likely have strengthened the model. Further investigation is warranted to clarify the biologic drivers behind the association of infection and subsequent VTE as well as why particular infection types such as pulmonary and hematologic infection impact downstream VTE occurrence over others. Our findings could suggest the importance of adoption of early infection control practices not only in preventing infection, but in potentially preventing downstream VTE. However, further study into the impact on VTE utilizing specific techniques such as minimizing ventilator time with early weaning protocols, early Foley removal, minimizing use of CVCs, and early physical therapy including ambulation of patients even when ventilated would be informative for this cause. Conversely, further work is required to evaluate whether the development of infection necessitates not only the early initiation of pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis to prevent VTE in this high-risk patient population, but perhaps a more optimal dose. The inflammatory cascade set in motion in response to infection might be particularly damaging to this fragile population and perhaps earlier and more aggressive strategies for VTE prevention should be considered in ICH patients in the setting of infection.
