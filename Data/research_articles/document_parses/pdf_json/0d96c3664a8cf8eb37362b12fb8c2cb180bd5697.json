We estimate how weather affects COVID-19 growth rate using data through April 13 th , 51 2020 by applying methods that improve model predictive accuracy, incorporate uncertainty, and 52 reduce biases. Based on emerging evidence, we developed several a priori predictions about how 53 weather, either directly or indirectly via modified human behaviors (e.g., aggregating indoors), 54 affects COVID-19 growth rate. Preliminary research on SARS-Cov-2 (9, 10, 12) and related 55 viruses (8, 13) predicted that COVID-19 growth would peak at low or intermediate temperatures. 56 However, other coronaviruses demonstrate weak temperature dependence, instead depending on 57 social or travel dynamics (7). High humidity also might decrease viral survival, limit 58 transmission of expelled viral particles, or decrease host resistance (13-15). Ultraviolet light 59 effectively kills viruses such as SARS-Cov-1 (16), and thus sunny days might decrease outdoor 60 transmission or promote immune resistance via vitamin D production (17). We also evaluate 61 demographic variables, assuming greater transmission in denser and older (>60) populations. 62 We modeled maximum growth rate of COVID-19 cases to estimate contributions from 63 underlying climate and population dependencies without healthcare interventions (e.g., social 64 distancing). Hence, we restrict analyses to the early growth phase before interventions reduced 65 transmission, but after community transmission began, when the vast majority of the population 66 was still susceptible to this novel virus. We estimated the average maximum growth rate (\u03bb) as 67 the exponential increase of cases (ln(Nt) -ln(N0)/t, where Nt = cases at time, t, and N0 = initial 68 cases) for the three worst weeks in each political unit (country or state/province depending on 69 available data (3)), where t = 7 days (see Supplementary materials for additional periods). 70 Testing and reporting of COVID-19 likely vary across political units. However, estimated 71 growth rates should remain robust to these biases assuming detection probabilities remain 72 constant during the short, one-week estimation period.

Initial climate associations 120 with viral outbreaks will first correlate with the narrower range of climatic variation found at the 121 emergence site and then in global transportation hubs, rather than reflecting ultimate biological 122 limits on growth and survival.

Based mostly due to variation in UV 128 and temperature, our model predicts that COVID-19 risk will decline across the northern 129 hemisphere this summer, remain active in the tropics, and increase in the southern hemisphere as The overall conclusion is that although COVID-19 might decrease temporarily during summer, 139 there is still a moderate probability that it is weakly affected by summer weather, and that it 140 could return in autumn and pose increasing risks by winter.",
