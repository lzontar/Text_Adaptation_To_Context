            "text": "Migration-both internal and international-is a source of potential specific stressors that could threaten migrants' well-being and mental health, e.g., communication difficulties, cultural differences, socioeconomic as well as employment status change [4] . It is also a challenging life transition that may be related to problems in the social area. Research has shown that students and visiting scholars from China in Canada report more communication problems, difficulties in making friendships, loneliness, and lower subjective adaptation, compared to non-Chinese Canadian and Chinese-Canadian students [5] . Research also suggests that depression symptoms are more prevalent among internal migrants in China compared to the general population [6] . What is more, internal migrant adolescents report lower levels of self-esteem, higher levels of depression, and have less social connections than local adolescents [7] . However, psychological adaptation of migrants may be facilitated by personal resources, such as self-efficacy beliefs [8] . Social Cognitive Theory [9] defines selfefficacy as ''belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the course of action required to produce given attainments''(p. 3). Self-efficacy has been shown to be one of the important factors that help an individual to deal with stressful life transitions and adjust to a new situation [8] . Maciejewski, Prigerson, and Mazure [10] found that self-efficacy mediates the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 relationship between dependent stressful life events and symptoms of depression among Americans with a prior history of depression. Moving to a new residence (internal migration) was the most often reported life event in the aforementioned study (n = 314), along with serious financial problems (n = 216) and life-threatening illness or injury (n =101) [10] .",

American expatriates in Europe with high levels of self-efficacy express greater degrees of cultural adjustment than those with low levels [11] . Wang and Sangalang [12] found that among Filipino immigrant employees in Canada self-efficacy is positively related to work adjustment. A study among Afghan and Kurdish refugees in New Zealand and Australia showed that self-efficacy beliefs were associated with higher subjective well-being and lower psychological distress [13] . Selfefficacy was also found to be a predictor of mental health among Malawian returning refugees [14] . Moreover, research among Somali adolescents resettled in the United States suggests that self-efficacy is positively related to a sense of school belonging and negatively to PTSD and depression symptoms [15] .",

            "text": "Not only self-efficacy beliefs but also social support from friends and significant others is positively related to psychological adjustment [16] and subjective well-being of migrants [17] . Therefore, the constitution of a new social network is very important for this population. There is one type of self-efficacy beliefs that may especially help migrants to establish new social bonds-social self-efficacy [18] . Although self-efficacy can be defined J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 [8] more globally as a \"traitlike general sense of confidence in one's own capabilities to master different types of environmental demands\" (p. 177), it is usually conceptualized as a context-specific construct [9] [19] . Research suggests that using domain-specific self-efficacy measures allows predicting the outcomes more successfully [20] . Social self-efficacy beliefs can be defined as [21] \"confidence in one's ability to engage in the social interactional tasks necessary to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships in social life and career activities\" (p. 98). Research has shown that social self-efficacy is negatively correlated with attachment anxiety, depression, and loneliness among internal migrants in the USAfreshman college students [22] . In addition, social self-efficacy mediates the relationship between attachment anxiety and loneliness [22] . Social self-efficacy is also negatively related to acculturative stress, depression, and self-concealment among international college students in the United States [23] . Fan and Mak [24] found that first-generation migrant students in Australia reported lower social self-efficacy than second-generation ones. They also reported more social difficulties and fewer shared interests with people in the host society, compared to second-generation migrant students [24] . International students in Canada also reported lower levels of social self-efficacy than Canadian and secondgeneration migrant students. Moreover, their low self-efficacy predicted low academic satisfaction and high psychological distress [25] . Similar results were obtained in Australia-Chinese migrant and overseas students reported lower self-efficacy than Anglo-Australian and second-generation migrant students from Southern Europe. Social self-efficacy was also positively related to academic satisfaction and negatively to psychological distress. Overall, the results of the aforementioned study suggest that social relationship issues impact the academic satisfaction of overseas students and migrants to a greater extent than the satisfaction of non-migrant students [26] . Therefore, it may be concluded that social selfefficacy is potentially beneficial for the psychological adjustment of migrants helping them J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 establish new connections in the social environment. However, most evidence for the positive effects of social self-efficacy is derived from non-experimental research. Our study addresses this gap.",

However, not all of these factors can be easily changed. On the other hand, self-efficacy beliefs in various domains, including initiating and maintaining interpersonal relationships, are malleable and can be intentionally enhanced [29] . In line with Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory [9] , selfefficacy beliefs can be altered by interpreting information from four different sources. First, perceived as the most powerful is mastery experience rooted in the interpretation of one's own performance in a specific domain as successful. Second, the vicarious experience is related to observing the accomplishments of others which can be interpreted as a proof of specific goals attainability. Encouraging feedback about one's own skills, abilities or performance given by significant others serve as a third source of self-efficacy beliefs, verbal and social persuasion. Psychological and emotional states are the fourth source. Individuals treat their emotional and physiological reactions like stress or anxiety while performing particular tasks as indicators of their capabilities [9] . Bandura's theoretical framework found support in empirical research results [30] [21] . Therefore, we can distinguish not only theoretically but also empirically the aforementioned sources in the context of social selfefficacy beliefs [21] .",

            "text": "There will also be several strengths of this study. Firstly, the content of the New in Town intervention is theory-driven. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to four sources of self-efficacy beliefs. According to Social Cognitive Theory, these beliefs can be enhanced by interpreting information from mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states [9] . Secondly, we will use well-validated measures of primary and secondary outcomes. The strong aspect of the study design is also using two follow-up measurement points that enable us to track long-term effects. Finally, the New in Town is designed specifically for migrants, who are potentially at greater risk of difficulties in the social area [4] [5] . ",

Some of them require interaction with other people.The intervention begins with psychoeducation on self-efficacy. This module presents an explanation of self-efficacy beliefs in the context of adaptation to the new place of residence. The next module provides insight into sources of self-efficacy beliefs and consists of an exercise aiming at enhancing self-efficacy through mastery experience. In order to complete the exercise participants are encouraged to make contact with other people by giving a compliment to them. The third module is dedicated to cognitive restructuring.Participants are taught how to recognize and undermine the validity of negative thoughts. The module contains an exercise in which participants may deal with own negative thoughts that have recently appeared. The fourth module discusses vicarious experiences by sharing the experience of other people in establishing new relationships. The exercise given to participants is to get to know the story of a person that moved into a new city and managed to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 make a new network of friends. The fifth module provides information about the benefits of engaging in enjoyable leisure activities. The module exercise is to define own interests and find events that are related to them via the Internet. Participants are asked to visit one of them. In the sixth module, participants will be provided with psychoeducation on social support. The module introduces social persuasions as the source of self-efficacy and includes an exercise in which participants are asked to talk to a person about the problem of making friends in the new place of residence. The seventh module explains the impact of emotional and physiological states on self-efficacy beliefs and introduces self-care tools. In the last module, participants are provided with psychoeducation on goal-setting. The module exercise is to specify the own goal of establishing and maintaining relationships. Participants are provided with tools to design an action plan to achieve a defined goal.",
