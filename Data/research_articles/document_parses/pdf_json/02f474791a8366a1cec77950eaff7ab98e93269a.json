Pedagogical agents using scaffolding have been shown to enable significant improvement in students' learning outcomes [6] . Scaffolding is timely support given to students to foster problem-solving and design skills [2] . The key features of scaffolding are ongoing diagnosis, adaptivity and fading, but these features are neglected by some developing pedagogical agents for complex environments, often equating scaffolding to additional support [9] . Good tutors are usually able to adjust to the learning style of the student and use a scaffolded approach by giving just enough support to help students solve their problem. However, with increasing class sizes and diversity, tutors cannot provide the levels of support needed [8] . Intelligent agents can be made to give the right amount of hints by tracking the current and goal states and capturing the proficiency level of the learner [7] .",

Inputs to the pedagogy agent includes the description of class diagram, methods that must be called specifying particular order if needed, and the quality related metrics. The class diagram supplied together with AI rule-based techniques capturing domain constraints help enforce consistency. For example, the agent forbids a message to be dispatched to a target object if the class it belongs to does not have a corresponding method. The data and methods explicitly capturing data dependencies allow knowledge state in entities to be maintained, preventing data to be dispatched prematurely. In the second stage when student submits the sequence diagram, student will be asked to re-attempt if the specified methods based on use cases are not called or if they are called in incorrect order. In the final stage when a student has submitted a valid sequence diagram, design will be graded based on the qualitative metrics supplied. For example, if distributed design is specified as a quality-criteria, a poor grade will be awarded if most of the messages are originated by the same entity. Figure 1 shows a sample sequence diagram for a class diagram with 4 classes Doctor, Hospital, Patient and Appointment.",

            "text": "All 243 students taking the first software engineering course were invited to the trial the agent, and out of the 94 students who volunteered only 68 proceeded to complete both tests and the survey. The average marks for pre-and post-tests were 46.25 and 61.25 respectively showing a 32% improvement. To study how the agent affects students with different grades, we analyzed the distribution of pre-and post-test marks in cycle 1, which had a substantial number of students as shown in Fig. 2 . The distribution of test marks before and after using the agent suggests weaker students (especially those scoring only 0-49 in the pretests) had the greatest gains. Note the number of students scoring in the range 0-49 declined by nearly 60% from 32 students to 13 students, suggesting a pedagogical agent can significantly improve the performance of stragglers in design activities. We designed a survey to study the effectiveness of the pedagogical agent from students' perspectives. The survey included Likert-scale and open-ended questions. Students were asked to complete the survey at the end of the modelling activity and tests. The survey was completed by 68 students. Questions were primarily about the agent, student's difficulties and whether the agent can help them get over misconceptions. The results showed around 61.4% of students found learning UML diagrams difficult while over 79% of the students found the modelling agent with instant feedback beneficial for learning UML design. Most of the students found the agent allowed them to grasp the interdependencies between class diagrams and SDs. The overwhelmingly positive response (over 80% agree and over 45% strongly agree) to the three questions related to student confidence, understanding and awareness suggests pedagogical agents can play a key role in improving the self-efficacy of students.",

Scaffolding has proven to be effective with diverse student cohorts as it helps to decompose complex problems into incremental constructivist steps [1, 16] . Our solution using a pedagogy agent approach allows cognitive load for modeling SDs to be gradually increased using scaffolding.

Effective tutors use scaffolding techniques to teach cognitively demanding tasks. Augmenting a goal and constraint driven agent with such scaffolding techniques appears to substantially improve the learning outcomes in modelling sequence diagrams. The scaffolding techniques allow creation of student specific pathways with varying levels of cognitive challenges and support. The varying levels of support are provided through prompting, feedback, guidance and problem decomposition. Problem decomposition allows cognitive load to be reduced when necessary by enabling students to focus solely on one aspect at a time. This longitudinal study allowed data collected from experienced tutors, lecturers and participants to evolve a more personalized approach to teaching to our increasingly diverse student cohorts.",
