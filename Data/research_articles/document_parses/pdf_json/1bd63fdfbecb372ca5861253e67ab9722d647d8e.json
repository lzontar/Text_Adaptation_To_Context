We assert that as a model study with the stated assumptions, the analysis presented in the paper is perfectly valid, however, any serious comparison with real data and attempts at prediction from the model are highly problematic. The main point of the present paper is to convincingly establish this assertion while providing a warning that the results and analysis of such mathematical models should not be taken at face value and need to be used with great caution by policy makers.",

At any time each compartment has a number of susceptible (S) , infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals and these evolve with time. The division into age groups is to account for the fact that the levels of contact between different groups (and within groups) vary and so they have different probabilities of passing infections. To discuss the main aspects of the model, it is sufficient to ignore the compartmentalization into age groups and we present the simpler version here. This more basic model is one which divides the population of size N into individuals who are susceptible (S) , asymptomatic infectious (I a ), symptomatic infectious (I s ) or are recovered (R), with the constraint N = S + I a + I s + R. The number R also includes people who have died.",

            "text": "is the average number of new people infected by one infected person. Typical values reported in the literature for Covid-19 are in the range R 0 = 2 \u2212 7[2]. Note that while R 0 is like the \"free\" reproductive number, u(t)R 0 is an effective reproductive number incorporating the fact that the number of contacts any individual makes has been brought down as a result of the lock down.The other parameters in the model are \u03b3, \u03b1 and the size of the susceptible population itself. Apart from these parameters, a solution of the above equations requires the initial data for S(0), I a (0), I s (0) and R(0).An immediate property of the model is that it leads to an exponential growth of the infected population at intermediate times. We can understand this easily by a linear analysis around the initial state with S = N, I a = I s = R = 0. This shows that the infected numbers grow exponentially as \u223c e \u03bbt with \u03bb = \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b3. Thus we get a growth only if R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 > 1.We now show results from the numerical solution of these equations with a choice of parameters (Set I below) consistent with[1] and make a comparison of our results with theirs. We find that the predictions of the simplified model are more or less the same asthose obtained from the more complicated model. However, on changing parameters to somewhat more realistic values [Sets (II,III)], the predictions change drastically. Parameter set (I): We choose the parameter values \u03b3 = 1/14 per day (14 days recovery time) and \u03b2 = 0.24 per day. This gives R 0 = 3.36 and the observed exponential growth rate of around \u03bb \u2248 0.17 (doubling time \u2248 4 days). We also fix \u03b1 = 0, t w = 0.1 and u l = 0. With this choice of parameters, let us now see how the infected population evolves as a function of time for the choice of initial conditions I s = 20, I a = R = 0 N = 10 9 . [Notes: (a) the values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 are different from [1] but they are consistent with known estimates of R 0 and the observed exponential growth rate in the Indian data for confirmed cases, (b) the values of \u03b1, t w and u l are as those used by [1] (they take t w < 1) and are clearly unrealistic, (c) the initial conditions are chosen so as to fit the initial growth seen in the real data after the confirmed number of cases is \u223c 20.] Parameter set (II): We keep \u03b3 = 1/14, \u03b2 = 0.24, \u03b1 = 0 and u l = 0 but change the time, for the lockdown to be effective, to a more realistic value of t w = 4.Forecast of the COVID-19 epidemic in India with the simplified SIR model: The evolution of the SIR model in Eqs. (1-4) starting with a seed infected population of size I(0) = 20 and a total population N = 10 9 . Lockdown is imposed after t on = 19 days. The other parameter sets are given in the figure legend. The horizontal black dashed line indicates an infected population of size I = 10 and we see that this number is reached approximately after 54 days from the start of lockdown (for Set I), after 68 days for Set II, while for Set III this takes about 101",

More importantly, as is clear fromFig. (1)and the inset, the predictions of the model are nowhere following the actual trajectory of the pandemic.",
