Indeed, this pattern is very different from what is seen in varicella, in which major nuclear atypia, large multinucleated cells, acantholysis secondary to ballooning degeneration, involvement of the epidermis basal layer and vasculitis are regularly seen. Other acantholytic disorder (autoimmune or familial pemphigus, Grover's transient acantholytic dermatosis) do share some histologic features with our cases, but with a distinct clinical context.
