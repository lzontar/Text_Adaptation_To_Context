Third, the threshold to go to the hospital can vary from country to country, we are also aware that RNA viruses can mutate rapidly and that could have an impact of the performance of the models. We therefore propose that those models should be continuously updated for example using privacy-preserving distributed learning approaches. 29,30 Fourth, the CT features used for this study are semantic features from the first CT scan, and quantitative features automatically extracted from CT images using radiomics or deep learning approaches may improve its prognostic performance, and follow-up CT scan may yield more information.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "Finally, there is also the fundamental weakness of nomograms, which do not give a confidence interval to the final output.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "Elderly COVID-19 patients with hypertension and non-hospital staff seem more vulnerable to develop a severe illness as per defining criteria, which can cause a wide range of laboratory and CT anomalies.
