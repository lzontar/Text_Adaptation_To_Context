This new coronavirus disease, now called COVID-19, has spread globally in six months, locking down the world, infecting millions of people and killing 0.4 million of them as of June, 7th 2020. To date, there is no effective specific treatment nor prophylactic vaccine. Most countries worldwide took restrictive measures including lockdown and social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve and limit virus transmission. The novel SARS-CoV2 coronavirus induces a large spectrum of disease from asymptomatic infections to severe pneumonia and death.

To determine the titers of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 Spike and Nucleocapsid in a subset of the samples of our panel, we performed 2-fold serial dilutions on six samples from the early phase of symptoms onset and six from later phase (> 30 days). The graphs show the changes of IgG binding intensities to the Spike (left panel) and the Nucleocapsid proteins (right panel) at the different dilutions. Curves in blue are early phase samples and those in red, from later phase.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the xMAP assay to detect IgG to SARS-CoV2 antigens in 138 samples; 77 negative control samples and 61 samples from COVID-19 patients \u2265 days after onset of symptoms", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Spike </td><td>Nucleocapsid (NC) </td><td>Spike+ and NC+ </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u2265 Day14 </td><td>95% CI </td><td>\u2265 Day14 </td><td>95% CI </td><td>\u2265 Day14 </td><td>95% CI </td></tr><tr><td>Sensitivity (%) </td><td>(n=138) </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>(n=138) </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>(n=138) </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>100.0 </td><td>92.7-100 </td><td>100.0 </td><td>92.7-100 </td><td>100.0 </td><td>f\n94.-100 </td></tr><tr><td>Specificity (%) </td><td>100.0 </td><td>94.2-100 </td><td>98.7 </td><td>92.2-100 </td><td>100.0 </td><td>o 95.2-100 o\n97.3-100 </td></tr><tr><td>Accuracy (%) </td><td>100.0 </td><td>100.0-100 </td><td>99.9 </td><td>99.7-100 </td><td>100.0 </td></tr><tr><td>PPV (%) </td><td>100.0 </td><td>94.1-100 </td><td>98.4 </td><td>91.4-99.7 </td><td>r100.0 9p\n00.0 9</td><td>4.1-100 </td></tr><tr><td>NPV (%) </td><td>100.0 </td><td>95.2-100 </td><td>100.0 </td><td>-95.2-100 </td><td>e\n1</td><td>5.2-100 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Sensitivity of the xMAP assay to detect IgG anti SARS-CoV2 antigens stratified by time since symptoms onset", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Time since symptoms </td><td>na\nN Ir\n</td><td>gG anti-NC Positive n positive (%) </td><td>IgG anti-SP n positive (%) </td><td>NC+SP+ n positieve (%) </td></tr><tr><td>onset </td><td>u10 o\n1</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u2264 Day 7 </td><td>5 (50) </td><td>5 (50) </td><td>3 (30) </td></tr><tr><td>Day8-Day13 </td><td>9 </td><td>15 (78.9) </td><td>16 (84.2) </td><td>15 (78.9) </td></tr><tr><td>JAfter Day13 </td><td>61 </td><td>61 (100) </td><td>61 (100) </td><td>61(100) </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>90 </td><td>81 (90) </td><td>82 (91.1) </td><td>79 (87.7) </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "End-point dilution titers of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 Spike and Nucleocapsid recombinant proteins in a subset of early and later phase samples.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Sample ID </td><td>Age </td><td>Gender </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>IgG titer </td><td>IgG titer </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Time since symptoms onset </td><td>Spike </td><td>Nucleocapsid </td></tr><tr><td>MP2594 </td><td>60 </td><td>F </td><td>5 </td><td>&gt;12800 </td><td>&gt;12800 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2575 </td><td>55 </td><td>M </td><td>7 </td><td>200 </td><td>400 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2636 </td><td>75 </td><td>F </td><td>8 </td><td>&lt;100 </td><td>of\n800 3200 o\n6400 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2684 </td><td>75 </td><td>F </td><td>8 </td><td>3200 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2702 </td><td>74 </td><td>F </td><td>10 </td><td>800 </td><td>p\n&gt;12800 r100 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2582 </td><td>NA </td><td>NA </td><td>12 </td><td>&lt;100 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2629 </td><td>NA </td><td>F </td><td>30 </td><td>-800 &gt;12800 e\n&gt;12800 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>MP2708 </td><td>74 </td><td>M </td><td>31 </td><td>&gt;12800 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2683 </td><td>71 </td><td>F </td><td>32 </td><td>r 3200 P\n</td><td>&gt;12800 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2705 </td><td>73 </td><td>M </td><td>33 </td><td>1600 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2694 </td><td>75 </td><td>F </td><td>46 47 </td><td>&gt;12800 </td><td>&gt;12800 </td></tr><tr><td>MP2628 </td><td>68 </td><td>M </td><td>l a\n</td><td>6400 </td><td>&gt;12800 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Cross-reactions of 61 SARS-CoV2 convalescent samples (> 2weeks after onset of symptoms) with SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV antigens.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>N positive/N tested </td><td>% </td></tr><tr><td>SARS-CoV1-NC+ </td><td>61 </td><td>100 </td></tr><tr><td>SARS-CoV1-SP+ </td><td>28 </td><td>45.9 </td></tr><tr><td>MERS-CoV-NC+ </td><td>2 </td><td>3.3 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "All the authors declared no conflict of inbterest.We would like to thank the patients who donated their blood and Mrs Coralie Sigounios for the administrative support.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "acknowledgement"}, {"text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}]}
