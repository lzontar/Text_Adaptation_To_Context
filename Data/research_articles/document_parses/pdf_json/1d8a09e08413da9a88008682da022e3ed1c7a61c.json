The development of the transistor in the 1950s, followed by the silicone integrated circuit, accelerated those capabilities and gave rise to what is commonly known as Moore's Law. According to this principle, the number of transistors packed into a dense integrated circuit doubles every 2 years. The corollary is that computation speed also doubles at 2-year intervals. Figure 1 is a graphical interpretation of Moore's Law, showing an exponential increase in computational power, in terms of calculations per second that can be purchased with $1000 (constant US, 2015) . According to that graph, computing power has increased by a factor of 10 18 from the mechanical analytical engine of the early 1900s to today's core I7 Quad chip found in personal laptop computers.",

Although endowed with abstract thinking and capable of sublime leaps in imagination, humans have a limited capacity for memory.

With uneven results, computerized systems have been proposed in the past to monitor ICU patients [4] , manage patients on mechanical ventilators [5, 6] , guide care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7] , and manage arterial oxygenation [8] . These early computer systems were programmed with highly specific and sequential IF/THEN/ELSE logical expressions that assessed the validity of a condition based on accepted physiological principles and/or clinical experience (Fig. 2 ). According to these expressions, IF a given condition was judged to be \"true,\" THEN the program executed instruction 1, ELSE, it executed instruction 2. AI is based on a fundamentally different approach to traditional computer programming. Instead of instructing the computer to evaluate a given condition, or to perform a specific task according to detailed programmed instructions, AI algorithms, in a manner similar to the way children absorb knowledge, learn from exposure to numerous examples. AI algorithms establish their own rules of behavior and can even improve on their \"intelligence\" by incorporating additional experiences resulting from the application of these rules.",

Classifier algorithms are trained with many lines of data, with each line having several input variables and one desired output. For example, a model designed to identify a breed of dog may be trained with data listing their traits or characteristics, e.g., height, type of hair, and length of tail. Each line will be associated with a specific breed. Once trained, the model can be asked to predict the dog breed when given new set of input variables. Two important steps are needed to build a classifier model. The first is to establish the number of classes the model will be required to identify. The second is to identify the number of variables required to describe the classes. Fewer variables and classes require less training data and result in simpler and more accurate models. The simplest classification model is the binary kind, in which the model is asked to choose between a \"Yes\" and a \"No\" answer. Classes may consist of physical objects (chair, table, etc.), medical conditions (e.g., sepsis, ARDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], etc.), clinical or physiological observations (e.g., different types of arrhythmia or ventilator asynchronies). Each class is associated with a number of input variables common to all classes. In machine learning parlance, input variables are known as \"features,\" with each line of data, or \"instance,\" containing several features and a single class.",

This is a very simple example having only one instance per class. The model, therefore, would be totally inadequate if its purpose were to differentiate among different dog or cat breeds. In that case, many more instances would be needed to describe different types of dogs and cats. The more specific one wishes to be, the more features are needed to describe the classes. On the other hand, increasing the number of features results in complex models that require greater computing power and longer time to run, a condition termed \"the curse of dimensionality.\" An important guiding principle in machine learning is the truism that \"less is best.\"",

Whereas humans develop generalized concepts on the basis of just a few examples, training a machine learning algorithm requires large quantities of data. The creation of a large feature matrix with its classification vector is accomplished by gathering as many instances as possible. Once satisfied that we have collected an adequate number of examples to be presented to the computer, we split the feature matrix into a \"training\" dataset, for model development, and a \"test\" dataset. The data are split by a random process that assigns instances from the original data to each dataset. A common practice is to use 70% or 80% of the data for training and the remainder for testing.",

Several types of classifier algorithms may be used to create the machine learning model. Among them are decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, and many others (Fig. 3) . A popular type of classifier algorithm is the neural network, modeled on the way human neurons are thought to process information.

Although the introduction of machine learning to the ICU is in its infancy, several studies have already been published describing the application of this technology in the management of the critically ill patient. Some have used large population datasets to predict length of stay, ICU readmission and mortality rates, and the risks of developing medical complications or conditions such as sepsis and ARDS. Other studies have dealt with smaller datasets of clinical and physiological data to aid in the monitoring of patients undergoing ventilatory support.",

This is in contrast to a clinical study showing the accuracy of physicians to be only 53% when predicting ICU length of stay [19] . A hidden Markov model framework applied to physiological measurements taken during the first 48 h of ICU admission also predicted ICU length of stay with reasonable accuracy [20] . The problem of ICU readmission was investigated with a neural network algorithm applied to the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. This is an open source, freely available database collected from patients treated in the critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.

Machine learning methods of detecting patient-ventilator asynchrony have been based on morphological changes of the pressure and flow signals. Chen et al. [37] developed an algorithm to identify ineffective efforts from the maximum deflection of the expiratory portion of airway pressure and flow. Ineffective effort was present in 58% of the 24 patients enrolled in their study. Analysis of 5899 breaths yielded sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ineffective efforts >90%. An algorithm developed by Blanch at al [38] . compared a theoretical exponential expiratory flow curve to actual flow tracings. A deviation exceeding 42% was considered indicative of ineffective effort. They compared the predictions of the algorithm in a random selection of 1024 breaths obtained from 16 patients, to those made by five experts and reported 91.5% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity with 80.3% predictive value. As proof-of-concept, this group also reported monitoring airway signals in 51 mechanically ventilated patients and were able to predict the probability of an asynchrony occurring from one breath period to the next using a hidden Markov model [39] . The system used in these trials has been commercialized as Better Care\u00ae, and it is capable of acquiring, synchronizing, recording, and analyzing digital signals from bedside monitors and mechanical ventilators [38] .",

[45] trained a convolutional neural network with 5500 abnormal and 5500 normal breathing cycles aimed at developing an algorithm capable of separating normal from abnormal breathing cycles, reporting 96.9% sensitivity and 63.7% specificity.",

Models are created and tested with instances culled from the same data population, and it is common to find reports of algorithms having very high accuracy scores in the machine learning literature. Given a judicious selection of features, a sufficiently large number of instances, and a wise choice of algorithm, the most likely outcome will be a highly accurate model. If the data are true and verifiable, the model's predictions are also bound to be reliable. On the other hand, when a model trained with untested or faulty data is presented with data drawn from the same population, the predictions are likely to be accurate but totally unreliable. As some have succinctly put it, rubbish in, rubbish out.",

Whereas AI is able to consider numerous variables and minimize human bias in data classification, it cannot insure model reliability. Therefore, the greatest challenge when creating a clinical machine learning model lies in identifying the gold standard to be used in the classification. A great deal of what we see and do in medicine is highly subjective, and unanimity of opinion is seldom found among intensivists. For example, a study [46] on interobserver reliability of clinicians in diagnosing ARDS according to the Berlin definition found only a moderate degree of reliability (kappa = 0.50). The main driver of the variability was the interpretation of chest radiographs. Similar findings were noted in clinicians evaluating optic disk photographs for glaucoma (kappa 0.40-0.52) [47] . It is therefore unlikely that model reliability in the ICU will ever exceed 60-70%, even in the best of hands.",

According to a thoughtful essay by Alan Morris [48] , intensivists must contend with no less than 236 variables when caring for patients on ventilatory support. The ability to catalog, correlate, and classify these variables on a continuous basis lies well beyond the capabilities of even the most knowledgeable and perceptive of clinicians.",
