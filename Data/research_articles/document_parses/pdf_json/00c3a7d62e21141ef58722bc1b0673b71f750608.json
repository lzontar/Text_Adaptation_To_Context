Furthermore, mistrust of the health care system due to the lack of culturally responsive and gender affirming services, and past negative experiences of stigma and discrimination by health care providers influence their engagement in care.

These interventions created safe spaces for participants to discuss gender issues, sexual risk, depression and substance use, with modest reductions in HIV risk and/or an increase in HIV knowledge among participants. One of these interventions also documented an increase in individual empowerment for some of the participants [14] . In addition to those interventions, a pilot group intervention to address the role of prior trauma in HIV prevention and treatment among TWOC was found to be feasible and acceptable, with positive coping among participants [15] . SISTA, an evidence-based, social skills-building, group-level intervention originally designed to reduce HIV risk behaviors and build gender and ethnic pride among African American (AA) heterosexual ciswomen, has been adapted by different organizations to be implemented with transgender women, including TWISTA for AA transgender women in Chicago and BACAHU for Latina transgender women in San Juan, Puerto Rico [16] . To the best of our knowledge, however, these interventions have not been rigorously evaluated. While the interventions above focused on HIV prevention, there has been little research about the needs of transgender women living with HIV to engage in care [17] . Grounded in the models of Health Care Empowerment and Gender Affirmation, Healthy Divas is a clinical trial currently being implemented to optimize engagement in HIV care for transgender women living with HIV. The Healthy Divas intervention is a combination of six individual sessions with a peer counselor and a peer-led group workshop with other transgender women, an HIV primary care provider, and a transgender health care provider [18] .",

Eight of the interventions included navigation services funded by the initiative.

Specifically among a sample of AA transgender women at risk for HIV or living with HIV, social gender affirmation was associated with greater personal competence, self-acceptance, and positive mental health outcomes [26] . The provision of gender-affirming services has been theorized as a facilitator and as a social determinant of health [27] . Gender-affirming services may positively impact TWOC's perceptions of healthcare and contribute to their engagement and retention in HIV care.

Staff that \"go the extra mile\", listened, showed they cared, worried about participants, and were part of, or knew the transgender community, provided \"a little shoulder to cry on\" and helped alleviate the isolation many participants experienced. Many participants had been rejected by their families, had little social support, and/ or had only disclosed their status to a very limited number of people. Many Latinas could not travel to their country of origin to see their families because of being undocumented in the U.S. For some, the interventionists were the only ones they felt they could talk to about personal issues and living with HIV, to find emotional relief, and to \"get things off my chest.\" Referring to talking to an interventionist, an AA participant (age 33, site A) said: \"We talk about my HIV. We talk about my drug use, my past drug use \u2026. When I'm down in the dumps I come in and I cry. When I'm happy I tell them what I'm happy about. We talk about everything.\" Sometimes using themselves or their life experiences as an example, the support provided by the interventionists included messages aimed to increase self-esteem, self-management, responsibility, personal empowerment, and participants' value as human beings. \"Helps to look forward\", \"da \u00e1nimos para salir adelante\" was the phrase used by a Latina participant (age 55, site D) when referring to an insightful conversation with an interventionist, with a stable job, living with HIV, well dressed, and seen as a role model: The socialization, sharing, sense of sisterhood, and learning from other participants' experiences in the educational, support, empowerment and community building intervention groups also contributed to provide emotional support. Depending on the site, the groups were facilitated by staff, co-facilitated by participants, and/or by outside transgender community members. To avoid HIV stigma and because they also served to attract and recruit participants to the interventions, groups in most interventions were open to any TWOC independent of HIV status. When asked what she got from the groups, an AA participant (age 41, site G) replied: \"Compassion, and loving, and caring, no judgment.\" While a Latina participant (age 47, site C) said:",
