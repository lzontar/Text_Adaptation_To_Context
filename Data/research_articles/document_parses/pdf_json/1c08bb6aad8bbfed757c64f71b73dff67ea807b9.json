It is worth noting that diUb Lys48 cleavage by SARS PLpro requires 5-fold higher concentration of enzyme compared to tetraUb Lys48 to observe activity. SARS PLpro wild-type (WT) activities were also compared to enzymes carrying mutations in the S1 Ub and S2 Ub binding sites using Lys48-linked diUb Lys48 and tetraUb Lys48 substrates ( Figures 3C and 3D ). As expected, the SARS PLpro S2 Ub mutant (F70S/E71K/H74G) exhibits diminished activity against tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure 3C , top) yet retains WT-level activity on diUb Lys48 ( Figure 3C , bottom). Thus, S2 Ub recognition is dispensable for diUb Lys48 cleavage, consistent with an S1-S1 0 binding mode being relevant for diUb Lys48 cleavage. In contrast, the S1 Ub mutant (R167S/E168R+helix) has diminished diUb Lys48 cleavage activity yet retains the ability to cleave tetraUb Lys48 chains with characteristic accumulation of diUb intermediates ( Figure 3C ). Single point mutants of the composite mutants (F70S for S2 Ub, E168R for S1 Ub) exhibit similar cleavage profiles ( Figure S4C ). These results suggest that mutations predicted to disrupt S1 Ub recognition do not prevent cleavage of tetraUb Lys48 when an intact S2 Ub binding surface is present.

Moreover, kinetic comparison of SARS PLpro mutants reveals that loss of S2 interactions (F70S/E71K/H74G; Figure 3E , green; Table 2 ) results in an $33-fold loss of catalytic efficiency (k cat and K M could not be measured independently, and the S2 mutant could not be saturated by the diUb Lys48 -AMC substrate, indicative of a binding defect). Thus, the S2 mutant converts SARS PLpro into an S1-dependent, monoUb-based DUB. In contrast, mutation of either the hydrophobic interaction in the S1 Ub site (M209S, Figure 3E , light blue; Table 2 ) or polar contacts to S1 Ub (R167S/E168R, Figure 3E , dark blue; Table 2 ) results in a modest decrease in catalytic efficiency, an effect mainly driven by a 2-to 3-fold increase in K M without a corresponding loss in k cat (Table 2) . Assaying additional point mutants at a single monoUb-or diUb Lys48-AMC substrate concentration mirrors these trends ( Figure S4D , top). Importantly, S2 mutants do not exhibit diminished monoUb-AMC cleavage rates ( Figure S4D , bottom), consistent with gel-based experiments, as they maintained activity when processing diUb Lys48 into monoUb. Structure-based alignment of the Lys48 linkage visible in the triazole-linked diUb Lys48 -ABP$SARS-PLpro crystal structure to native Lys48 in free diUb Lys48 (PDB: 1AAR) suggests that the triazole-linkage mimics the distance and geometry of a native isopeptide-bond ( Figure S4E ). To test if the triazole linkage is a good functional mimic of the native isopeptide-bond, we generated a native isopeptide-linked diUb Lys48 -AMC reagent (Figure S4F ) and assayed initial cleavage rates for triazole-linked and native diUb Lys48 -AMC substrates ( Figure S4G) . Results indicate that the triazole linker is a faithful mimic of the isopeptide bond as initial cleavage rates are similar (despite native diUb Lys48 -AMC being contaminated with monoUb-AMC precursor; see Figure S4F ).

Given the extended conformation of diUb Lys48 observed in complex with SARS PLpro and the paucity of contacts to the diUb Lys48 linkage ( Figure 2C ), we hypothesized that SARS PLpro might indirectly sense linkage specificity by requiring that diUb occupies both S2 Ub and S1 Ub sites, a requirement that would place limits on the type of chain that could be accommodated because of differences in chain topology and distance between individual Ub molecules relative to the two Ub binding sites.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 242, "end": 259, "text": "(Ye et al., 2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 410, "end": 436, "text": "(Keusekotten et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 437, "end": 459, "text": "Mevissen et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 460, "end": 477, "text": "Sato et al., 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 478, "end": 497, "text": "Sato et al., , 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 783, "end": 792, "text": "Figure 2C", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "S2-S1 Recognition by SARS PLpro Underlies Lys48 Ub Chain Linkage Specificity"}, {"text": "To assess S2-S1 linkage specificity of SARS PLpro, we tested a panel of linkage-specific distal diUb-ABPs to covalently label SARS PLpro.

Since covalent activitybased probes are very reactive, we also tested linkage-specific diUb-AMC substrates by analyzing initial cleavage rates by SARS PLpro. These results suggest that SARS PLpro activity is highly restricted to diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage ( Figures 4B and  S5B ) as diUb Lys48 -AMC is cleaved $100-fold faster compared to other linkages. Each chain-forming residue in S1 Ub is available for conjugation in our diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro complex (Figure 4C ), but the distance between S1 Ub-Lys48 and the SARS-Phe70 S2 Ub binding site is closest (26 \u00c5 ) with each of the other sites requiring an additional 10 to 15 \u00c5 to span between the conjugated lysine and S2 Ub binding site ( Figure S5C ). This raised the possibility that linkage-specificity across S2-S1 is enforced by restricting access to other topologies by requiring that SARS PLpro read the distance between diUb Ile44 hydrophobic patches via S2-S1 ( Figure 2B ), a requirement that is only satisfied by chains carrying Lys48 linkages.

This latter mixed chain could be recognized by SARS PLpro in S2-S1, but its cleavage would require accommodation of a Lys63-linkage across S1-S1 0 . A time course reveals that SARS PLpro readily cleaves homotypic Lys48 tetraUb chains but is inactive on homotypic Lys63 tetraUb chains. Interestingly, the mixed chain is cleaved when the Lys63 linkage is presented across S1-S1 0 , but only when an intact S2 site is present ( Figure 4G ). Initial cleavage rates ( Figure 4H) show that SARS PLpro is $5-fold slower in cleaving the mixed chain compared to the homotypic Lys48-linked chain, suggesting some specificity for a Lys48 linkage across S1-S1 0 . More importantly, the S2 Ub-Ile44 mutant exhibits faster cleavage rates on homotypic Lys48 chains than on mixed or on homotypic Lys63linked chains (Figures 4G and 4H ). Taken together, these data suggest a measurable specificity for Lys48 across S1-S1 0 , even when diUb Lys48 recognition via S2-S1 is compromised. Thus, Lys48-specificity of SARS PLpro is enforced by S2-S1 recognition but complemented by a preference for Lys48 linkages across S1-S1 0 , suggesting that SARS PLpro would be most active on polyUb Lys48 chains.

SARS PLpro S1 Ub and S2 Ub mutants were used to cleave ISG15-AMC using Michaelis-Menten kinetics ( Figure 5A ). Mutations have contrasting effects for ISG15-AMC cleavage (Figure 5A ; Table 2 ).

Analyzing loss of HMW polyUb Lys48 -conjugates and the appearance of free ISG15, indicative of cleavage of ISGylated substrates, reveals contrasting effects for S2 and S1 mutants ( Figure 5C ).

Thus, ISG15 recognition appears more dependent on interactions within S1 and perhaps an alternative S2, while diUb Lys48 recognition is more dependent on contacts within S2.

To our knowledge, the diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro structure represents the only available structure of a linkage-specific DUB bound to a Lys48-linked Ub chain, a result enabled by recently developed diUb activity-based probes .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 169, "end": 191, "text": "(B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 583, "end": 592, "text": "Figure 5D", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Recognition of DiUb Lys48 and ISG15"}, {"text": "Instead of relying on diUb recognition across S1-S1 0 , as is common among other DUBs (Keusekotten et al., 2013; Mevissen et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2015) and endoproteases (Berger and Schechter, 1970) , SARS PLpro recognizes diUb across S2-S1 binding surfaces that are tuned to recognize Lys48-linked Ub chains. This mode of Ub chain recognition has only been reported for the catalytic core of OTUD2, where an additional bind-ing site mediates interaction with a Lys11-linked diUb (Mevissen et al., 2013) . Through modeling, mutational analysis, and the crystal structure of a monoUb-bound SARS PLpro, the Mesecar group suggested that SARS PLpro is an S2-S1 mode DUB and that the distal Ub would be recognized by a hydrophobic surface in SARS PLpro, involving Phe70. Our current study illuminates the structural basis for this interaction. We provide biochemical evidence that the S2 Ub interface has a dominant role in diUb Lys48 recognition and polyUb chain cleaving activity, since mutating the distal S2 Ub recognition surface is more detrimental than disrupting the proximal S1 Ub recognition surface.

Briefly, synthetic N-terminally biotinylated Ub thioester (25 mg/mL) and synthetic K48-thiolysine Ub (25 mg/mL) were ligated in 8 M Gdn.HCl / 200 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.6 in the presence of 1.2 M mercaptophenyl acetic acid (MPAA) for 16 hours at 37 o C. After HPLC and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), the resulting Bt-diUb Lys48 Cterminal carboxylic acid (13 mg/mL) was converted to its MESNa-thioester using recombinant UBA-E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme (250 nM) in 200 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.7 containing 10 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl 2 and 100 mM MESNa for 1 hour at 37 o C. After HPLC purification, the appropriate fractions were pooled and lyophilized to yield Bt-diUb Lys48 -MESNa, which was ligated to K48-thiolysine Ub (25 mg/mL) in 8 M Gdn.HCl/ 200 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.6 in the presence of 1.2 M MPAA for 16 hours at 37 o C.

Concomitant HPLC and subsequent SEC-purification resulted in the target compound: Bt-triUb Lys48Cloning, protein expression, purification and crystallization. The generation of recombinant SARS and MERS PLpro has been previously described (Bekes et al., 2015) . Briefly, the nucleotide sequence (nts 4451-7179) from MERS HCoV ORF1a (GenBank AGV08402.1) and the nucleotide sequence encoding the SARS PLpro minimal domain (nts 4884-5829, aa 1541-1885, PDB: 3MJ5) were gene synthesized by GenScript and subcloned into pET28b with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. All mutations were generated by over-lapping PCR and verified by sequencing. DUBs (SARS and MERS PLpro and USP21 CD ) were expressed in E.coli BL-21 codon plus RIL cells and purified until homogeneity as previously (Bekes et al., 2015) . Briefly, E.coli was grown at 37\u00baC until OD 600 =1.0 and induced with 1 mM IPTG and further incubated at 30\u00baC for 4 hours. Harvested cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00baC until purification. Frozen pellets were thawed on ice and lysed in 20 mM Tris, pH=8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 1% NP-40 and 10 mM imidazole by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto Ni-NTA resin (Quiagen) for batch-binding by rotation for 1 hour at 4\u00baC. Ni-bound DUBs were eluted with 20 mM Tris, pH=8.0, 350 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole and 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, concentrated and purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-75 (16/600) column (GE); peak fractions were collected, concentrated to 1-10 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00baC until use.
