            "text": "For many diseases, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is a threshold parameter for disease extinction or survival in isolated populations. However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since R 0 < 1), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, R 0 < 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.",

            "text": "Many pathogens affecting humans circulate between humans and animals through contact, food or indirectly through common disease vectors in the environment. Other pathogens move across population boundaries due to the movement of people. The basic reproduction number -the average number of secondary cases arising from each primary case in a susceptible populationdetermines whether or not the introduction of a small number of infectives will lead to an epidemic or establishment of endemicity in the population. Effective interventions can interrupt transmission by reducing the basic reproduction number below one, preventing the disease from causing an epidemic or establishing endemicity. Moreover, with the notable exception of disease systems exhibiting 'backward bifurcations' (Brauer, 2004) , reducing the basic reproduction number below one for an isolated population will cause disease extinction even if endemicity has previously be established. However, continual exposure to a disease reservoir or continual importation of cases from another * Corresponding author. population will continue to replenish the infected population, and so a disease may establish and persist in a population even if the basic reproduction number is less than one. There is a rich literature in meta-population models that capture the interactions of populations that introduce or reintroduce pathogens to one another (e.g. Balcan et al., 2009; Ball and Neal, 2002; Becker and Dietz, 1995; Hufnagel et al., 2004) ). However, one often only has data or interest in a single population but needs to account for external sources of infections. It is in this context that we wish to generate some simple principles or rules for estimating the reproduction number. There is also a rich literature studying vector-borne diseases (e.g. Reiner et al., 2013) , where individual transmission events occur primarily or exclusively between different species of host (e.g. mosquito to human or human to mosquito but not human to human or mosquito to mosquito). In these diseases the dynamics of the infection in each host are inseparable. Rather we are interested in studying disease systems where the rate of exposure to a reservoir or the rate of importation of infected individuals can be assumed to be at least approximately constant and independent of the transmission dynamics within the population of interest.",

Others have developed methods to account for the often large proportion of imported cases at the beginning of new epidemics, which if excluded or treated as if locally acquired would overestimate the reproduction number (Mercer et al., 2011) . Though the term 'elimination' has been defined in many different ways (Cohen et al., 2010) , reducing the local reproduction number below one is one measure of this progress (Churcher et al., 2014) , and is a necessary step towards global eradication. Methods have been developed to estimate the reproduction number that account for the potentially large proportion of imported cases in settings where progress is being made towards elimination (Churcher et al., 2014) . However none of these methods account for susceptible depletion and so are restricted to diseases with very low prevalence (Cauchemez et al., 2013; Churcher et al., 2014; Kucharski et al., 2014) or calculate the effective reproduction number (Mercer et al., 2011) , which is not a threshold parameter for disease persistence. Starting with simple models and incorporating heterogeneity or multiple strains, we have derived simple rules for estimating the basic reproduction number in a population where the disease is at endemic equilibrium due to a combination of local transmission within the population and reservoir exposure or imported cases. Many of these rules only require knowledge of disease prevalence and the proportion of infections attributable to the external source. We have applied these rules in two case studies of C. difficile infections.",

We include two sources of infection: (1) transmission within the population which is proportional to the number of people infected (rate: \u03b2i) and (2) constant transmission from some reservoir that does not depend on the number of people infected (rate: f ). Transmission within the population could be through direct contact, or mediated via fomites, airborne droplets, water or food provided this transmission scales with the infectious population. For our purposes a reservoir is anywhere where the pathogen persists apart from the human population, for instance a population of wild animals or livestock animals that carry the disease. The disease in the human population can be described by a system of ODEs for the proportion of the population that is susceptible (s) and infected (i)):",

The disease can be maintained by transmission within the population in the absence of reservoir exposure if and only if the prevalence exceeds the proportion of transmission from the reservoir. This simple rule has surprising implications. For diseases with low prevalence (e.g. 2%), if a small but larger portion (e.g. 3%) of transmission is from the reservoir, then the disease cannot be sustained in the population by transmission within the population alone (since R 0 = 1\u22120.03 1\u22120.02 < 1). Preventing the small proportion of transmission from the reservoir (reducing f and \u03c0 to 0) will cause the disease to become extinct in the population. Nevertheless, names like 'food-borne' or 'zoonotic' may be misleading for such diseases because the source of transmission is another human in most (e.g. 97%) individual infections. Instead we call these diseases reservoir-driven. We define the reservoir-driven threshold as the minimum proportion of transmission which must be from the reservoir for the disease to be considered reservoir-driven (I in our simple SIS model).",

Disruption of the gut flora, often caused by consumption of antibiotics or proton-pump-inhibitors, allows C. difficile to proliferate in large numbers (Britton and Young, 2012) .

A robust immune response to these toxins is able to neutralise their effect (Kelly and Kyne, 2011) and most of the population have anti-toxin antibodies starting at a young age (Viscidi et al., 1983) . Immune responses protect against symptoms but not protect against colonisation (Loo et al., 2011) .

In the USA in the years 1993-2014, 20%-34% of admissions who had a C. difficile infection had it as their primary diagnosis (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), 2014). This is in excess of typical prevalence of colonisation and infection amongst hospitalised patients: a review of colonisation prevalence reported a range of 4%-29% (Furuya-Kanamori et al., 2015a) .

            "text": "So far, we have assumed hospitalised patients are homogenous, but this is not the case. Patients who have recently been administered antibiotics are not more susceptible to colonisation but are more likely to develop symptoms and be more infectious (Loo et al., 2011) . Thus, an SIS model with heterogeneous infectiousness is perhaps more appropriate. However, heterogeneity in infectiousness alone does not affect the estimate of the reproduction number (Section 4.2). Factors affecting susceptibility to colonisation exist and adjusting for these will increase our estimate of the reproduction number (Section 4.1), but this is unfortunately beyond the scope of this case study. However, our simple estimates of R 0 are in agreement with more sophisticated models of C. difficile transmission in hospitals that have found that the reproduction number is likely to be less than one in many or most hospital settings (Lanzas et al., 2011; McLure et al., 2017) . There are many strains and types of C. difficile and it has been suggested that certain strains or types, such as NAP1/RT027, are particularly hospital-adapted (Fawley et al., 2016; Knight et al., 2015) . It is possible that these strains have significantly higher reproduction numbers in the hospital than we have estimated above and thus may be self-sustaining in hospitals. Unfortunately, we do not have strain-level or type-level data for all strains or types. However, the article used to calculate our first estimate of the reproduction number reports the proportion of infections and colonisations typed as NAP1/RT027 (Loo et al., 2011) . As the authors did not type all isolates, we assume that un-typed isolates were equally likely to be NAP1/RT027 as the isolates from similar patients that were typed, and that the proportion of NAP1/RT027 infections in those with onset <72 h after admission (not reported) was similar to patients with colonisation at admission (13%). Under these assumptions, approximately 32 out of 150 (21%) colonisations or infections with NAP1/RT027 were present at admission. Of the approximately 10% of cases that were colonised or infected for some part of their hospital stay, approximately 3% were with NAP1/RT027 and the remaining 7% were with other types. Though colonisation with non-toxigenic strains appears to be protective against infection with toxigenic strains , we do not have good information about the interaction of C. difficile types. Nevertheless, we can use the argument we presented in Section 5 to bound the invasion reproduction number. This becomes as in Box II The basic reproduction number (i.e. in a completely susceptible population without competition with other types) is slightly greater (see Box III) This suggests that even if other strains were eliminated and NAP1/RT027 did not compete for hosts, the continual importation of colonised and infected individuals would be required to sustain endemic disease in the study hospital. If we perform the same analysis for the pooled non-NAP1/RT027 strains in the study (approximately 212 of 334 colonisations and infections were present on admission) the equivalent upper bounds for the invasion reproduction number and basic reproduction number are both approximately 0.4. Therefore, it appears that NAP1/RT027, though importation-driven, was better adapted for transmission in the study hospital than other strains.",

            "text": "It is worth providing some clarifying remarks about how these estimates of reproduction numbers should and should not be interpreted. As noted in Section 3.3, these reproduction numbers do not include any secondary cases that may arise from the primary case following discharge, either in the community or during a subsequent readmission to a hospital (either the same hospital or a different one). A reproduction number that counted these secondary cases would be strictly higher than those estimated here. Nevertheless, the reproduction numbers estimated here are threshold parameters for disease extinction in individual hospitals in the absence of imported cases. Since our calculations suggest that this reproduction number is likely to be below the critical threshold of one, it follows that preventing the admission of colonised individuals, or the effective isolation of patients colonised at admission would drive within-hospital transmission to extinction, a conclusion corroborated by some quasi-experimental studies (Longtin et al., 2016) . However, note that this conclusion would hold true even if all patients who are colonised on admission are patients who have acquired the pathogen in a previous hospital stay. Consequently, based on these calculations alone, we cannot conclude that eliminating all transmission in hospitals would not also eliminate (or dramatically reduce) the proportion of admissions that are colonised at admission. In other words, the calculations in this paper imply that the admission of colonised patients is essential for the maintenance of endemicity in hospitals, but do not imply the converse statement, that within-hospital transmission is not essential for the maintenance of endemicity in hospitals. Nevertheless, we have previously used models of C. difficile transmission in hospitals and the broader community that are better able to answer this question to demonstrate that this converse is also likely to hold in most settings (McLure et al., 2019a,b) .",

C. difficile is also commonly found colonising pets and livestock, while C. difficile spores are frequently isolated on meat, fresh produce and in water (Hensgens et al., 2012) . Crucially, there is significant overlap in strains observed in human and non-human sources (Knight et al., 2015) .

Consequently, we cannot use our methods to estimate the reproduction number, but we can calculate the reservoir-driven threshold.

Some individuals will have higher exposure to these reservoirs (depending on diet and lifestyle factors), but this alone will not affect the reservoir-driven threshold unless those with greater exposure are also are more (or less) infectious (Section 4.3). Heterogeneous infectiousness due to potential differences between patients with and without symptoms, or differences between patients with and without recent antimicrobial exposure does not affect the food driven exposure in isolation (Section 4.2). However, communities are not homogenous with regard to C. difficile colonisation risk, as demonstrated by the higher rates of colonisation and infection in hospitals, aged-care facilities and the very high colonisation rates amongst infants.

Furthermore, the pathogen's interactions with medications, gut-flora and host immunity leads to greater complexity than can be captured with a simple SIS model. The risk-categories of individuals change over time as patients age or move in and out of hospitals and so a multi-patch with age structure would provide better estimates. Nevertheless, this very simple calculation serves as a back-of-the-envelope estimate for the plausible range of the reservoir-driven threshold, demonstrating that under a range of reasonable assumptions a relatively small amount of transmission from animals could be sustaining endemic disease in human populations. Our simple calculations with figures from the middle of the reported prevalence range agree with a detailed, model of hospitals and communities that found the reservoir-driven threshold was between 3.5% and 26.0% for a wide range of plausible assumptions (McLure et al., 2019a) .",

It could be the case that some strains are sustained by exposure to animals, while other strains -though also present in animal populations -are sufficiently transmissible between humans to persist without transmission from animals. C. difficile PCR ribotype 078 (RT078) is a particularly good candidate to consider as a reservoir-driven strain. Though it is not known what proportion of human RT078 cases can be attributed to transmission from an animal source, whole-genome sequencing of isolates of this strain from livestock and humans strongly suggest frequent transmission between these groups (Knetsch et al., 2018) . On the other hand NAP1/RT027 which is found in livestock but appears to be more transmissible between people than other strains, might have some human cases attributable to animal sources but is less likely to be animal-driven (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2013) . Finally RT001, which accounts for many human infections in European settings, appears to be uncommon in livestock (Rodriguez-Palacios et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "We have outlined the theory and application of very simple rules to estimate reproduction numbers in the presence of reservoir-exposure or imported cases. The rules require minimal information about the population and the pathogen of interest and could be a useful starting point or alternative to more complex models tailored to a population or pathogen. Churcher et al. have developed a statistical test using branching process theory to infer whether R 0 < 1 in populations that are nearing disease elimination but have many imported cases (Churcher et al., 2014) . Cauchemez et al. use a similar approach that accounts for incomplete case detection and the overrepresentation of larger outbreaks to estimate the reproduction number for emerging zoonoses (Cauchemez et al., 2013) . However, their models assume almost all the population is susceptible and so are not Fig. 3 . Estimates of the reservoir-driven threshold for C. difficile in human populations and its dependence on the prevalence of each of four risk groups. In each subfigure, the prevalence in one risk group is varied across the reported range (Furuya-Kanamori et al., 2015a) (x-axes) while the other three prevalences are fixed at the values indicated by the vertical lines in the other subfigures. We consider two scenarios; one where each of the fixed prevalences is assumed to be in the middle of the reported range (solid lines and curves); the other the same except the prevalence in infants is only 25% (dotted lines and curves). We assume that 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 97% of the population are in the hospital, aged-care, infant and 'other' risk groups respectively. suitable for situations where the prevalence of infection or immunity is far from zero. Moreover, the latter method assumes that the reproduction is less than one so is not appropriate in settings where is there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the reproduction number is above or below one (Cauchemez et al., 2013) . Our model accounts for susceptible depletion and works for infections where the reproduction number is above or below one, but relies on estimates of prevalence to do so. This can pose a potential difficulty as often incidence rather than prevalence is reported. Reliable estimates of prevalence either requires nearperfect case acquisition or surveys of sero-prevalence, carriage or infection and these surveys must have large sample sizes if prevalence is low. Indeed, a good deal of the variability in colonisation prevalence reported for C. difficile outside hospitals might be attributed to the relatively small sample sizes involved (Furuya-Kanamori et al., 2015a) . Another potential difficulty with our method of estimating reproduction numbers comes when one tries to estimate the proportion of cases that are attributable to the reservoir or importation. It is often easier to demonstrate that there is some movement of pathogens into the population of interest from reservoirs or other populations, than to estimate the proportion of cases in the population that can be directly attributed to these external sources. Even in our case study, though genetic evidence demonstrates transmission of C. difficile between animals and humans (Knetsch et al., 2018) , the proportion of transmission from animals remains completely unknown. Extensive, high-resolution molecular typing of pathogens (e.g. whole genome sequencing) can be of use here and has been used to estimate the proportion of C. difficile infections in hospitals that can be attributed to transmission from symptomatic, hospitalised individuals and link symptomatic individuals to asymptomatically colonised infants (Stoesser et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2012) . For other diseases, the more traditional epidemiological tools such as identifying exposures to the reservoir may be successful, especially if exposure to the reservoir is clear and uncommon (e.g. butchering the reservoir animal species (Zumla et al., 2015) ).",

It does not follow that if a disease is reservoir-driven or importation driven, then interventions targeting the external source and transmission from the external source will be most effective or 'best'. The 'best' control strategy will depend on the relative effort required to prevent each kind of exposure, the impact of these interventions and metric used to compare these. If it is equally feasible and desirable to eliminate all exposure from either source, eliminating transmission from the reservoir or importation is clearly the better choice for a importation-driven or reservoir-driven disease as this will prevent all local human cases, while preventing only local transmission or preventing only transmission not linked to reservoir exposure will prevent only a portion of infections. However, if only modest reductions are feasible, then targeting local human transmission may be more effective. One can calculate the normalised derivatives of equilibrium prevalence to estimate the reduction in prevalence achieved by a small reduction in each kind of transmission. For example, in the homogenous SIS model with reservoir-exposure, a greater reduction in prevalence is achieved by reducing reservoir exposure only if more than half of cases are acquired from the reservoir 1 . This is true whether or not the disease is reservoir-driven. A similar rule can be derived for the SIS model with imported cases.",
