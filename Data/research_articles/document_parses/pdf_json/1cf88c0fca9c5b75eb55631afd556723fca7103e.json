Therefore, measurements of blood leukocyte subtypes (e.g., Europhiles, lymphocytes) by number and function (e.g., natural killer cell activity) may not refl ect the immunocompetence as a whole. Also, the host immune system is sensitive to many factors such as age, gender, nutrition state, and stress; consequently, it is diffi cult to predict the overall effects of small to moderate changes on immune parameters on host resistance.

General information as to the infl uence of chronic exercise also will be discussed. Leukocytosis (increase in leukocyte number) in peripheral blood is noticed during an exercise bout. Leukocytosis depends on exercise type, intensity, duration, and is attenuated by exercise training [ 4 , 11 ] . Exercise up to 30 min leads to an increased leukocyte cell count, which then returns to baseline levels within 10-30 min after exercise. This period of leukocyte level returning to baseline may be longer if exercise duration is longer [ 1 ] . Researchers originally attributed this leukocytosis to hemoconcentration. Nonetheless, this theory was rejected because the fl uid loss from plasma during exercise does not fully explain the large increase in peripheral blood leukocytes, which may be more than double at maximal aerobic exercise [ 32 ] . A biphasic response characterized this leukocytosis. A redistribution of leukocytes from marginal pools has been proposed to explain this sharp increase that occurs in the fi rst phase. At least two factors have been postulated to be responsible for this redistribution: (1) the increase in cardiac output that induces a greater mechanical force that drags leukocytes from blood vessels walls; and (2) catecholamine release that might be responsible for a down regulation of leukocytes and/or endothelial cells adherence capacity [ 4 , 11 , 32 ] . However the second increment also called \"delay leukocytosis\" is present only in extensive aerobic exercise (>1 h) and 2-4 h after a short bout of exercise. This occurs almost exclusively due to an increased number of neutrophils that are released from bone marrow [ 11 ] . This increase in neutrophils, moreover, likely is mediated by an increase in granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) rather than from epinephrine or cardiac output [ 1 ] . Previous studies in which cortisol was infused in healthy participants demonstrate that increments in cortisol plasma levels seem to be responsible for the delayed leukocytosis. Therefore, recent evidence shows that short bouts of intense exercise may cause this delay in the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow [ 11 , 33 ] .

Indeed, research has demonstrated that counts of neutrophils and monocytes circulating in blood may increase by about 90 % after an intensive bout of exercise [ 32 , 33 ] . Neutrophils are the predominant circulating leukocytes with importance in the nonspecifi c immune function by phagocyte bacteria, virus, and protozoa, which is followed by intracellular digestion mediated by granular hydrolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species. Moderate intensity exercise may enhance neutrophils' respiratory burst activity, mediated by increase in infl ammatory cytokine IL-6 [ 11 ] . Degranulation appears to be mediated by exercise because a postexercise plasma elevation in concentrations of elastase and myeloperoxidase has been found [ 11 ] . Prolonged and acute exercise do not appear to provoke neutrophil degranulation changes during exercise, yet a great reduction of elastase release per neutrophils has been observed 2.5 h postexercise in response to bacterial stimulation. Also, intense or long duration exercise may suppress the production of reactive oxidants via elevated circulating concentrations of epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol [ 34 ] . In principle, improved responsiveness of neutrophils to stimulation following exercise of moderate intensity could mean that individuals participating in moderate exercise may have improved resistance to infection. On the other hand, competitive athletes undertaking regular intense exercise may be at greater risk of URTI. To investigate the long-term effect of endurance training (>10 years) on immunity, a study assessed phagocytic activity of circulating neutrophils at rest and after a submaximal bout of exercise in well-trained cyclists (VO 2max 61.0 ml/ kg/min) and sedentary age-matched controls (VO 2max 37.4 ml/kg/min). Results showed that circulating neutrophil phagocytic capacity was approximately 70 % lower in trained individuals at rest compared to that of control participants. Therefore, prolonged periods of endurance training may lead to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections by diminishing immune function at rest [ 35 ] .

Specifi cally, this is accomplished by either phagocytosis or receptormediated endocytosis. This way, a T cell can recognize and react to the antigen; however, T cells can only recognize antigens that have been processed and presented by cells via an MHC molecule. After a prolonged bout of intense exercise, the expression of some Toll-like receptors (TLR) on monocytes decreases. TLRs are receptors that recognize molecules, which are broadly shared by pathogen that allow antigen presenting cells to recognize pathogens [ 11 ] . The decrease of TLR 1, 2, 4 was described by Lancaster et al. [ 36 ] . Further studies are needed to clarify whether this decrease is real or merely refl ects a decrease in monocytic count.

NK cells are a heterogeneous subpopulation of lymphocytes that are the most responsive immune cells to acute exercise. They are part of innate immunity and their main function is to destroy virus and tumor cells. Two main NK cell subtypes have been described; that is, NK cells bright (CD56 bright ) and NK cells dim (CD56 dim ). NK cells dim are the expressed high level of CD16 and are the most cytotoxic subtype. NK cells bright express absent or low levels of CD16 resulting from high levels of cytokine production. They appear to play an important role in early immune challenge by coordinating the action between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The decision to lyse a target cell is made by these cells via a complex signal system in which activating and inhibiting signals or the Killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) is involved. NK cell activating signals should dominate over inhibiting signals to lyse the target cell. If an NK cell is engaged with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 molecule, the inhibitory KIR is activated, and the presenting signal prevents NK cells from killing host cells (non-MHC restricted) [ 37 ] . In response to an aerobic or anaerobic exercise, NK cells are mobilized faster into the peripheral blood circulation.

Moderate regular exercise has been found to increase NK cell function in both sedentary individuals and cancer patients [ 39 , 42 , 43 ] . A study conducted in obese women showed that 6 weeks of walking for 45 min, 5 days/week, produced a 57 % increase in NKCA compared with the 3 % increase found in the control group [ 44 ] . A marked increase in NK cell count, generally, is documented at the end of exercise, which may be due to a catecholamine-mediated demargination of cells. The opposite occurs several hours after exercise; specifi cally, the NK cell counts drops about 50 % compared with normal levels. In general, the normal resting value is restored in a couple of hours or within 24 h, except in prolonged intense and stressful exercise which might take longer. Also if activity is both prolonged and vigorous, the decrease in NK cell counts and NKCA may begin during the exercise session [ 39 ] . This decrease in NK cell number and cytolytic activity seems to be irrelevant for recreational participants, but becomes more important in athletes who might experience this immunosuppression several times per week.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 204, "end": 220, "text": "[ 11 , 38 , 39 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 336, "end": 347, "text": "[ 40 , 41 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 470, "end": 486, "text": "[ 39 , 42 , 43 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 669, "end": 675, "text": "[ 44 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1257, "text": "[ 39 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Role of NK Cells in Immunosurveillance"}, {"text": "The role that intense exercise plays in the risk of URTI has multiple potential explanations. Commonly a temporary drop in circulating NK cells is observed after a vigorous exercise bout, which generally lasts for several hours. At fi rst sight, this period of time seems to allow easier access to infected microorganism and is commonly known as \"open window.\" NK cells count and activity typically have been described as being depressed for only a few hours. The new technology has revealed that high intensity exercise does not destroy NK cell. Instead, high intensity exercise is responsible for catecholamine secretion that increases the activation of adhesion molecules; therefore, NK cells are redistributed to reservoir sites such as walls of peripheral veins [ 4 ] . Information about the role of NK cells and moderate exercise was reviewed earlier in this chapter. Changes in salivary IgA (s-IgA) immunoglobulin concentration and secretion rates have been postulated as the only consistent immune measures to date responsible for the increase in upper respiratory symptoms (URS) [ 3 , 4 , 11 , 32 ] . The immunoglobulin-A is the predominant Ig in mucosal secretions that, in concert with innate mucosal defenses, provide the \"fi rst line of defense\" against pathogens and antigens presenting at the mucosa [ 45 ] . Meanwhile, research has shown that prolonged high intensity exercises provoke a fall in s-IgA concentration, while short and moderate exercise increases it [ 45 -52 ] . Decreased secretion rate of s-IgA have been implicated as risk factors for subsequent episodes of URTI and URS in athletes and nonathletes [ 4 ] . The mechanism underlying exercise-induced modifi cations in s-IgA remain unclear. Furthermore, adrenaline seems to be partially responsible. Chronic stress, like intensive training, is associated with diminished functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (HPA), suppressed effects on IgA synthesis, and/or transcytosis (process by which various macromolecules are transported across the interior of a cell) [ 4 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 767, "end": 772, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1107, "text": "[ 3 , 4 , 11 , 32 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1321, "text": "[ 45 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1490, "text": "[ 45 -52 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1637, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2058, "end": 2063, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Possible Mechanisms Underlying Immune Suppression Through Intensive Exercise"}, {"text": "In 2011, a group of highly recognized researcher in the fi eld announced by consensus that high incidence of infections are reported in individuals with selective defi ciency of s-IgA very low saliva fl ow rates.

Lymphocytes express a high density of \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptors, and the density of these receptors increase due to exposure to exercise or catecholamines. The NK cells are the lymphocytes that express most of the density of these receptors followed by Lymphocytes cytotoxic T cells (CD8 + ) and Lymphocyte B cells (CD19 + ); and Lymphocyte T helper cells (CD4 + ) express the least amount. For that reason NK cells are more sensitive to exercise modulation, while CD4 + shows the lowest response to exercise. Lymphocytosis was observed during and immediately after an acute bout of exercise followed by decreased below resting levels during early stages of recovery. The decrease is largely observable in T lymphocytes, especially Th1 subtype, while B lymphocyte showed a lesser effect. The extent of exercise mobilization is primarily dependent on exercise intensity and duration [ 53 ] . Adrenaline seems to be responsible for this biphasic response. It is not clear as to whether the decrease is due to apoptosis or redistribution. Also, the decrease in Th1 T lymphocytes count alone does not necessarily imply reduced host immunosurveillance. The position Stand (2011) concludes that acute intensive exercise produces a depression of acquired immune system function. This depression is usually short-lived and will resolve within 24 h unless insuffi cient recoveries between exercise sessions cause chronic depression of acquire immunity [ 4 ] .
