The infrastructure of almost all hospitals is currently redirected to provide a maximum of intensive care resources, including the necessary staff. In parallel, routine as well as emergency clinical care for all patients in need has to be secured. This challenge becomes particularly evident in cancer care. In order to maintain adequate oncological care at all levels of provision and to conduct especially curative and intensive treatments with a maximum of safety, continuous adaption of the oncology care system has to be ensured. Intensive communication with colleagues and patients is needed as is consequent expert networking and continuous reflection of the own developed strategies. In parallel, it is of high importance to actively avoid cessation of innovation in order not to endanger the continuous improvement in prognosis of cancer patients. This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research. Here, we describe measures taken at the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) -a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellenceduring the COVID-19 crisis. We aim to provide support and potential perspectives to generate a discussion basis on how to maintain high-end cancer care during such a crisis and how to conduct patients safely into the future.",

On March 16, 2020, with the beginning of the nationwide lockdown, Hamburg counted 35 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, and the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) started to take the first profound infrastructural measures to protect patients and staff members as well as to prospectively provide resources to face the upcoming challenges of the pandemia. On April 10, more than 3,370 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were reported in Hamburg, more than 250 patients have been treated in hospitals, and about 80 of them with intensive care. The UKE continued its extensive preparations to provide a maximum capacity of intensive care beds (> 150). Graduated schemes to focus on human resources, the provision of hospital beds, as well as a nearly complete shutdown of research activities except for re-2 DOI: 10.1159/000508272 search on SARS-CoV-2 infection at the medical faculty were drawn by the central UKE task force, all of them challenging and potentially impacting cancer care. Hematology and oncology societies (e.g., DGHO, ESMO, EBMT, ASCO) as well as selected US cancer centers started to report some guidelines for cancer care [1] [2] [3] [4] . With a wide spectrum of measures, the UCCH prospectively and continuously faced the challenges and implications of the COVID-19 pandemia. Structural aspects were assessed at all levels in order to assure cancer care with maximum safety.",

This UCCH task force acts as the key and central group for decisions on safety and preventive measures, general and individual decisions on patient guidance and treatment, planning of staff resources, changes in the UCCH infrastructure, as well as the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients and staff members (Fig. 1) . According to the rapid dynamics of the crisis and its continuous implications internally and externally, task force meetings are held in a fixed schedule 3 times a week with additional ad hoc meetings whenever needed, which has proven to be an effective strategy to achieve maximum preparedness. The task force holds continuous discussions with the Infection Prevention and Control team and the UKE Board of Directors. General infrastructural measures were implemented in order to protect patients and staff members as well as to provide human staff resources for subsequent transfer to intensive care units (ICU). For treatment guidance, general measures were developed. However, also acknowledging that outside existing recommendations for oncological treatments, individual treatment modifications may result in ethical conflicts, the task force has implemented a dedicated team to discuss individual cases requiring treatment in time. Published statements and guidelines of health authorities and cancer societies are continuously reviewed and implemented. Furthermore, the task force provides its knowledge on specific expertise in cancer care, e.g., in palliative treatment, to the teams directly involved in the management of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",

Interdisciplinary Cancer Care In terms of interdisciplinary care for solid cancer patients, the surgical departments have dramatically reduced their elective operation programs while at the same time ensuring immediately necessary cancer surgery to be maintained. Interdisciplinary tumor boards are kept running but partially changed to videoconferences and/or limiting the number of participants to one representative decision maker per department involved in the case. Special attention has to be put on avoiding delays in consultation and treatment which may adversely affect potentially curable patients. However, due to potential delays in cancer diagnosis resulting from patients avoiding physician visits in the community and from less intensive diagnostic strategies being conducted in private practice care, the number of referrals for cancer surgery has dropped by about 25% in the last 4 weeks.",

All patients on the affected 2 wards were tested the same night and turned out to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. This did also account for 36 further staff members (e.g., physicians, nurses, psychooncologists, and physiotherapists) regarded at increased risk for transmission (category I; > 15 min face-to-face contact to the infected patient without protection) according to the guidelines of the German health authority (Robert Koch Institute; RKI). The enormous number of contact persons identified also clearly showed the impact of 1 affected patient on the infrastructure in a hospital with several staff members having to be put immediately into quarantine. This example also elucidated that the quarantine rules are per se not always feasible in a center running with highvolume and high-quality cancer care, which requires a large amount of highly qualified staff. The RKI had acknowledged this challenge in its recommendation (https://www. rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/ HCW.html;jsessionid=CDC92DAF0583CDECC079E3D0 44A2DD6C.internet061#doc13848752bodyText2). For our center, additional repetitive SARS-CoV-2-specific PCR monitoring of asymptomatic staff 5, 6, 7, and 9 days after the last at-risk contact was implemented. Even more important, implementation of consequent staff protection rules by the task force had the goal to consequently avoid category I contacts. This accounts for direct patient care with adequate mask protection, but also restrictions and protection during regular personal exchanges among nurses and physicians. In this context, it has to be mentioned that all contacts with low risk of transmission (category II, < 15 min face-to-face contact to the infected patient) were offered testing on a voluntary basis 7 days after the last at-risk contact by the institution. All staff members tested in the follow-up monitoring of asymptomatic personnel 5, 6, 7, or 9 days after the last at-risk contact turned out to be negative. Overall, the liberal testing offered for employees by the UKE turned out to be positive in the sense of patient and staff protection: It enables early identification of oligo-and asymptomatic, but infected staff members and, therefore, also identifies those who come to work despite being affected but have the immediate wish to help in a crisis of limited resources.",

These cases, which have led to an extensive screening of all patients in our center as well as all the various staff members. The whole process including the infection chains is highly complex and currently still under investigation. As mentioned before, the first detected infection was most likely imported into our center by an outpatient with primary diagnosis of acute lymphatic leukemia, who was concomitantly affected by COVID-19. At a time point more than 2 weeks later, when the majority of patients of the general cluster was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, the staff members of all oncology wards were already working under mask protection. Also, screening procedures for SARS-CoV-2 on the oncology wards and for patients admitted with hematological cancers, and the general ban for all visitors had been implemented, and indeed the majority of patients affected had actually been tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 before admission or during their inpatient stay. All infected cancer patients were transferred from the oncology center to a dedicated COVID ward of the UKE guided by an interdisciplinary, dedicated team of physicians specialized in general internal medicine and oncology. The oncology team is solely situated in the COVID-19 area of the main UKE building and acts completely separately from the UCCH in order to provide and continue cancer treatment for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients on the above-mentioned specialized ward and on the ICU. Despite SARS-CoV-2 infection, we were able to continue antileukemic therapy in several patients in urgent need of therapy. Two patients became PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2 under continued antileukemic therapy. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to oligosymptomatic cases up to severe COVID-19-affected lung disease. In total, 6 patients out of this cluster needed mechanical ventilation. Two patients, 1 elderly patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia and an > 80-year-old patient with end-stage myelofibrosis, had died. In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 cluster, main extended measures taken were containment of 4 wards for 2 weeks, repetitive and complete screening of all admitted patients and all staff members of the center, including those without direct patient contacts, and the change from standard to FFP2 masks in the whole building. As we are able to report so far, this led to a complete and successful containment of the situation. ",

As all wards involved in cancer care are mainly unaffected by those regulations when patients admitted are of unmet therapy need, the financial gap might be not as large as in other disciplines. The overall resource utilization in the UCCH wards was > 90% during March, clearly indicating that inpatient cancer treatment cannot be paused during the virus pandemic outbreak. However, a more stringent isolation policy with more single room use and use of inpatient resources for testing will reduce the number of patients treated. The transfer of outpatient visits to phone call visits will be translated into economic compensation rates. In our opinion, all efforts have to be done to avoid financial restrictions in cancer care now and in the near future.",

However, the implication of different oncology entities and specific treatment modalities, the impact of immunosuppression, aplasia, or other distinct high-risk situations are unclear so far. This is even more relevant, as current data suggest a potential role of a cytokine storm leading to potentially severe lung impairment. Consequently, the question arises if specific drugs used in oncological treatment, such as immune-oncological treatments, monoclonal antibodies, or targeted therapies, might potentially also have a distinct effect on the clinical course. To address these questions, the UCCH and its network, together with the University Hospitals in Kiel and L\u00fcbeck, have now initiated a prospective observational trial where SARS-CoV-2 infections in cancer patients are systematically reported, including prospective biobanking of peripheral blood samples.",

Furthermore, we have to anticipate that due to the current changes in social behavior and resources, cancer diagnosis will be delayed, and more patients will be diagnosed in the near future at a more advanced stage. The unrestricted access for patients to the innovative technologies in oncology, to clinical trials, second opinions, and center-specific treatments will not be kept up as before the COVID-19 pandemia. The temporary shutdown in translational research will lead to a delay in relevant and groundbreaking findings, which will extend far beyond the time of the pandemia: Fundamental experiments will be delayed, grant applications will not be submitted in time, and manuscripts will potentially not be completed. In parallel, relevant third-party funding will be redirected towards funding to unravel the burden of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Cancellation of conventions and meetings will negatively impact the scientific exchange in the expert community and will lead to a lack in interdisciplinary and multinational networks.
