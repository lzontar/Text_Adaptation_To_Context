We found that bat cells accumulate less chemical than human and mouse cells, and efficient drug efflux mediated by the ABC transporter ABCB1 underlies this improved response to genotoxic reagents. Inhibition of ABCB1 triggers an accumulation of doxorubicin, DNA damage, and cell death. ABCB1 is expressed at higher levels in several cell lines and tissues derived from bats compared to humans. Furthermore, increased drug efflux and high expression of ABCB1 are conserved across multiple bat species. Our findings suggest that enhanced efflux protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds, which may contribute to their low cancer incidence.",

Although these model organisms share some tumour suppressor mechanisms with humans, emerging evidence suggests that long-lived mammals have evolved unique and robust anti-cancer strategies 2 . For example, genome and transcriptome analyses of the bowhead whale, a large and long-lived mammal with a low rate of cancer, revealed a positive evolutionary selection of the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) gene and duplication of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene, both DNA repair genes 3 . These data imply that an enhanced DNA repair pathway might protect whales from cancer by lowering the mutation frequency. Genomic analysis of elephants, which also have a low cancer incidence, uncovered a high number of TP53 pseudogenes, and elephant cells displayed an enhanced TP53-dependent DNA damage response compared to human cells 4, 5 .",

They are the second largest order of mammals in the world 11 , the only mammal capable of poweredwing flight, and an asymptomatic reservoir for many deadly viruses 10 . Their longevity data predominately come from fieldbased studies, and therefore, their true longevities may be underestimated, and they may live longer than these reported records [12] [13] [14] . In general, longevity is positively correlated with the body size 12, 13 . Austad and Fischer 13 defined the longevity quotient (LQ) which takes the consideration of body mass in the estimated maximum lifespan of individual mammalian species. Bats possess one of the highest LQ value among the mammal order 12, 13 , indicating that bats live much longer than other mammals of equivalent size. Their higher LQ makes bats interesting species to study since they may have unique tumour suppressive mechanisms compared to humans. Only a handful of cases of tumours have been recorded to date for bats in captivity [15] [16] [17] . However, the underlying mechanisms of tumour suppression in bats are still not fully understood. To understand such mechanisms, we previously performed genomic analyses of Pteropus alecto (P. alecto) and Myotis davidii, and discovered that the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway of bats had undergone positive evolutionary selection 18 . The DDR pathway is the major mechanism that detects and repairs damaged DNA and highly conserved in a diverse range of organisms 19 . DNA damage can induce cancer via multiple mechanisms, including genomic instability, inactivation of tumour suppressors or activation of oncogenes 20 . Living organisms are constantly exposed to environmental xenobiotics and internal metabolic by-products, some of which can possess genotoxic properties that can lead to DNA damage 21, 22 . Elucidating whether and how bats efficiently resist DNA damage will advance our understanding of cancer biology.",

We found that cells exposed to \u03b3irradiation displayed \u03b3H2AX foci rather than pan-nuclear accumulation ( Supplementary Fig. 1B) , consistent with DSBs. To further confirm these results, we detected the DNA repair protein p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) by immunofluorescence. 53BP1 is recruited to DSBs to facilitate non-homologous endjoining repair and is released upon repair 26, 27 . We observed an increase in the number of 53BP1 foci in PaLung and WI-38 cells exposed to \u03b3-irradiation, which reduced gradually and similarly over time (Fig. 1b) . On the other hand, the number of 53BP1 foci increased slowly in \u03b3-irradiated MEFs and remained high at least 12 h after irradiation (Fig. 1b) , consistent with a previous report about DNA repair 28 . Together, these results suggest that lung fibroblasts from P. alecto and human are similarly sensitive and responsive to DNA damage induced by ionising radiation, whereas MEFs display a slightly slower response to the same treatment.",

ABC transporters are the primary transporters that efflux genotoxic substances, thereby reducing intracellular xenobiotic concentrations 32 . To determine if ABC transporters contribute to the difference in doxorubicin accumulation between bat, human and mouse cells, we used verapamil (Vera) to inhibit efflux via ABC transporters 32 , and assessed doxorubicin accumulation by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Specifically, we pre-treated cells with or without verapamil for 30 min, added doxorubicin for 3 h and measured intracellular doxorubicin levels. No notable differences were observed in the doxorubicin fluorescence intensities between control and verapamil-pre-treated WI-38 cells (Fig. 3a, b) , suggesting that WI-38 cells exhibit no endogenous drug efflux capability via ABC transporters. Similarly, no obvious differences were detected in doxorubicin accumulation between control and verapamil-pre-treated MEF cells (Fig. 3a , b) and HEK293T cells ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). In contrast, verapamil-pretreatment increased doxorubicin fluorescence in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Likewise, pre-treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA), another ABC transporter inhibitor 32 , also led to an increase in doxorubicin fluorescence in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells, but not in WI-38, HEK293T, and MEF cells (Fig. 3b) . These results suggest that the drug efflux activity of ABC transporters is required to reduce doxorubicin accumulation in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells. Furthermore, primary P. alecto cell lines derived from kidney (PaKidney), spleen (PaSpleen), brain (PaBrain), and bone marrow (PaMarrow) also displayed a similar increase in doxorubicin accumulation with verapamil pre-treatment (Fig. 3c) .

To determine the transporter(s) responsible for the efflux of doxorubicin in bat cells, we re-analysed our previously published genome-wide transcriptome data set of P. alecto kidney cell line PaKiT03 33 . We identified three highly expressed ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2) that are well-characterised for doxorubicin efflux (Fig. 5a) 32, 34 . To determine if one of these transporters is required for doxorubicin efflux in P. alecto cells, we reduced the expression of each gene in PaKiT03 cells via small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown (Fig. 5b) and examined the effects on intracellular doxorubicin accumulation by flow cytometry (Fig. 5c ). Verapamil was used as a positive control for efflux inhibition. We found that only ABCB1 knockdown increased doxorubicin accumulation to a similar extent as verapamil pre-treatment, suggesting that ABCB1 is the transporter responsible for doxorubicin efflux in P. alecto-derived cells.",

To determine if ABCB1 is differentially expressed in P. alecto compared to human cells, we first performed RT-qPCR on a panel of cell lines. Consistent with our RNA-seq results from PaKiT03 and HEK293T cells (Fig. 5a) , ABCB1 transcript levels were significantly higher in various P. alecto cell lines than in various human cell lines (Fig. 7a) . Further, ABCB1 protein levels were higher in PaLung and PaKiT03 cells compared to human WI-38 f Quantification of cell viability. Cells were pre-treated without or with 5 \u00b5M verapamil for 30 min before the treatment with the indicated amount of doxorubicin alone or together with verapamil for an additional 3 h. Doxorubicin was then removed and replaced with the doxorubicin-free medium in the absence or presence of verapamil for 72 h before measuring cell viability. Cell viability (%) is presented relative to the control cells (the first grey bar). All data shown have at least three experimental repeats and the images are representative. Scale bar represents 50 \u00b5m. Bars represent the means \u00b1 SDs of three independent experiments. Statistical significances were calculated using unpaired student's two-sided t test. p < 0.05 is represented with *, p < 0.01 with ** and p < 0.001 with *** and HEK293T cells (Fig. 7b) . Next, we examined ABCB1 transcript and protein levels in various normal tissues from P. alecto and human. We found that ABCB1 levels are higher in P. alecto than in human across multiple tissues (Fig. 7c, d) , including tissues known to express ABCB1 in human (adrenal gland, kidney, small intestine and large intestine) as well as those that express no or very little ABCB1 in human (lung and spleen). These data suggest that ABCB1 is expressed at higher levels and more broadly in P. alecto compared to human. A comparison of P. alecto ABCB1 amino acid sequence with the human sequence demonstrated similarity of 89.5% (Supplementary Table 1 ). In addition, Walker A-, Walker B-, and active transport signature-motifs, which are characteristic of ABC transporters, were 100% conserved across multiple phylogenetically distant mammals ( Supplementary Fig. 4) , indicating that the ABCB1 amino acid sequence is well-conserved among mammals. Therefore, the increased drug efflux via ABCB1 in P. alecto cells compared to human cells is likely due to the higher expression of ABCB1 rather than the amino acid sequence differences.",

Using cell lines established from P. alecto, we discovered that P. alecto cells uniquely displayed increased resistance to DNA damage induced by specific chemicals.

In mammals, ABCB1 is specifically expressed in regions of detoxification, excretion, and protective barriers such as the intestinal epithelium, lumens of the liver, proximal tubule of the kidney as well as blood-tissue barriers of the brain. In rodents, the ABCB1 gene encodes two isoforms, Abcb1a (Mdr1a) and Abcb1b (Mdr1b). Mice deleted for Abcb1a alone or both Abcb1a and Abcb1b are viable and not cancer-prone in laboratory conditions, which are free from genotoxic substances. However, they are more sensitive to toxins than wild-type mice 38, 39 . We found that P. alecto expresses ABCB1 relatively highly and in additional tissues compared to human, such as lung and spleen.

This broad chemoresistance is achieved by the promiscuous substrate specificity of ABCB1. Cancer cells acquire ABCB1 overexpression after prolonged chemotherapy, which is one of the major causes of cancer relapse since ABCB1mediated drug efflux can reduce drug intake 32, 34 . Likewise, generating cancer cell lines with high ABCB1 expression to study the biological implications of ABCB1 often requires prolonged exposure of cells to drugs for months 41, 42 . It is, therefore, rather intriguing that various bat cell lines from many different tissues intrinsically possess and maintain high-ABCB1 expression and drug efflux in the absence of known selective pressure. Notably, in addition to xenobiotics, ABCB1 is reported to transport endogenous compounds such as cytokines, short peptide and lipids 43, 44 . It is possible that bat cells may possess endogenous substances that are ABCB1 efflux substrates, and thus express high levels of ABCB1 to maintain homoeostasis. ABCB1 expression is regulated by multiple signalling pathways and physiological factors. Previous studies have reported that c-Myc, c-Jun, HIF-1 and CtBP1 can positively modulate ABCB1 expression in cancers, leading to the development of drug resistance 45 . Recent work on microRNA biology (miRNA) such as miR-27a 46,47 , miR-223 48 and miR-451 46 , have also illustrated their potential roles in regulating ABCB1 expression. Furthermore, physiological substances including steroid hormones, environmental stresses such as temperature, osmotic pressure and pH, and xenobiotics such as insecticides, heavy metal and DNA damage reagents have been shown to significantly modulate ABCB1 expression in vitro 45 . Interestingly, human pathogenic virus and virus proteins are also reported to induce ABCB1 expression 49, 50 . Since bats are renowned for being a reservoir of high mortality viruses like Ebola 51 and SARS 52 , some viral proteins may induce ABCB1 expression. It remains to be elucidated how bat cells induce and retain the high expression of ABCB1.",

The mechanisms of cell death induced by doxorubicin are cell context-dependent and could be mediated by DNA damage or be independent of DNA damage such as replication stress or oxidative stress to proteins and other organelles 57 . Importantly, our data show that bat cells accumulate less doxorubicin compared to human and mouse cells, leading to reduced DSBs, and that ABCB1 is responsible for the reduced doxorubicin accumulation in bat cells.",

In our experiments, we found that \u03b3H2AX resolved faster in P. alecto cells than in human and mouse cells when transiently treated with etoposide. Etoposide is a well-known ABCB1 substrate, therefore human and mouse cells would be expected to have higher residual intracellular etoposide than P. alecto cells even after drug removal from the media, leading to more DNA damage and \u03b3H2AX accumulation than P. alecto cells. Thus, the prolonged \u03b3H2AX in human and mouse cells could reflect not only DNA repair but also DNA damage caused by residual etoposide. Similar to doxorubicin, the assessment of DNA repair caused by etoposide between the P. alecto, human and mouse cells is challenging since the amounts of intracellular etoposide are not equal among these animals.",

In addition, miRNA analysis revealed that three tumour suppressive miRNAs (miR-101-3p, miR-16-5p and miR-143-3p) were upregulated and a single tumour promoting miRNA (miR-221-5p) was downregulated in Myotis myotis 59 .
