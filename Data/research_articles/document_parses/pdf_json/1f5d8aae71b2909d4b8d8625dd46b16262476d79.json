The second and perhaps more important aim is to facilitate the nursing communication network that is sharing the wealth of nursing knowledge and experience. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) 1 has outlined a 4-pronged strategy to (1) prepare and be ready; (2) detect, prevent, and treat; (3) reduce and suppress; and (4) innovate and improve. Registered nurses (RNs) on the front lines have been working for weeks with limited resources, and they have been instrumental in all 4 prongs outlined by the WHO.",

Two hundred years later, during a pandemic, nurses are once again tasked to reduce contamination. A vital key to Nightingale's success was her ability to disseminate her observations. Clearly, one truth is that there is no single intervention, modification, or tip that only 1 hospital in the world has discovered. Unique to 2020 is the rapidity through which these ideas can be shared. 5",

Only by judicious use of resources can we extend the window of protection for frontline staff. Improved staffing ratios have already been shown to reduce cost and outcomes. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Increasing the staffing ratio, clumping activities, and designating an RN to be a \"runner\" and not be in an isolation room enable that a nurse can stay in a COVID-19 room without the need to doff PPE to retrieve supplies or medications, nor overstock/ oversupply the room. Videoconferencing and digital stethoscopes allow staff to assess the patient without being in the room (this is functionally similar to an RN in the room performing the NIHSS while the neurology team observes). In some cases, the video link (secure) can be shared with family to further reduce foot traffic while facilitating family virtual presence.",

            "text": "Relocating equipment, such as intravenous (IV) pumps, ventilator control panel, and the bed to facilitate the safe removal of equipment outside the room, all have the benefit of reducing the number of times an RN needs to go into the room (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at http://links.lww.com/ JNN/A252). This reduces the unnecessary use of PPE and increases staff safety. We found that relocating equipment had the downstream effect of creating a tripping hazard (IV tubing) and also a risk that the tubing would kink and obstruct flow. An innovation and simple solution was to repurpose a urinary catheter stabilizing device (StatLock, CRBard Inc) to secure the tubing to the patient and to an IV pole. This was further enhanced by a roll of tape (see Supplemental Digital Content 2, available at http://links.lww.com/ JNN/A253) that prevents the IV tubing from occluding. This also ensures the IV extension tubing used does not touch the floor, reducing the risk of contamination. Call out here space for staff to eat, drink, and relax (even if only for a few minutes) is vital to preparedness. By creating a makeshift breakroom, we further reduce foot traffic while simultaneously promoting staff wellness. Staff ingenuity such as clumping activities and moving IV pumps outside the room helps decrease the risk of exposure. The use of a dedicated person to observe doffing (spotter) is vital; this person not only helps ensure the proper steps are followed in the proper order but also can act as a set of eyes to monitor for accidental exposure risk (eg, the outside of the gown touches the RN's skin). Additional visual cues are provided using dressing tape. Because rooms are being repurposed during high census, there are often rooms without ante room. Tape is placed to mark an area inside the room and 6 ft from the bed where the initial doffing (mask and face shield) takes place before the RN exits the room to Clumping of activities Performing tasks at one time allows the patient to rest but also reduces the number of times a nurse must enter the room.",
