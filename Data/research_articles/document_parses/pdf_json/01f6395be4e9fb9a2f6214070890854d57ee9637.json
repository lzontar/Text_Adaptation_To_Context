Although implementing these methods in wildlife comes with the inherent challenges of limited sampling opportunity, lack of reference genomes for nonmodel organisms, and high start-up costs of learning new laboratory and analytical techniques, it remains a worthwhile and versatile endeavor. Depending on the resources available, ability to collect samples, complexity of the hostparasite system, and questions most relevant to effective conservation, managers can pick and choose the methods that best address their needs (Fig. 2) . Further, decreased sequencing costs and increasingly user-friendly analytical pipelines have rendered these methods accessible to studies of nonmodel organisms. When multiple questions arise and resources allow, applying an integrative molecular approach represents an exciting new frontier in wildlife disease ecology. Concurrent examination of interconnected factors within molecular diversity can elucidate patterns and processes relevant to complex wildlife disease systems. As evidenced in case studies of DFTD and chytriodiomycosis, analysis of genetic, gene regulatory, and microbial variation provides important insight into pathology, transmission dynamics, and novel avenues of treatment. For DFTD, genetic and transcriptomic analyses were needed to distinguish host from parasite, confirm allograft transmission and Schwann cell origin of the disease, and discover means of immune evasion through suppression of immune signaling amid minimal immunogenetic diversity in hosts. These insights have since informed management strategies, including ongoing treatment development and management of captive insurance populations (Pye et al. 2016 ). In the case of chytriodiomycosis, genetic and transcriptomic analyses have furthered understanding of immune processes involved in species-specific resistance to fungal infection, and microbial analyses have provided promising new treatment options through bioaugmentation with naturally Bd-resistant microbes (Bletz et al. 2013; Woodhams et al. 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1826, "end": 1842, "text": "(Pye et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2156, "end": 2175, "text": "(Bletz et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2197, "text": "Woodhams et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 682, "end": 690, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Applying an Integrative Molecular Approach to Conservation"}, {"text": "Overall, application of molecular methods will enable more effective monitoring and management of at-risk populations. Depending on questions and data types examined (Fig. 2) , understanding of wildlife disease prevalence, pathology, and persistence can be improved. Parasite genetics can refine diagnostic techniques, reconstruct transmission pathways, and identify genes underlying virulence. Similar analyses in hosts can characterize host population structure, patterns of immunogenetic diversity, and specific genes associated with resistance and tolerance strategies. Further examination of gene regulatory diversity can identify specific mechanisms underlying successful parasite invasion and host morbidity that may serve as targets for epigenetic intervention. Finally, commensal microbial analyses can elucidate patterns of dysbiosis associated with host disease state and suggest probiotic bioaugmentation as a novel treatment strategy. Especially when considered alongside other drivers of disease state (Fig. 1) , molecular analyses present innumerable opportunities to advance management of wildlife disease and mitigate threats posed to human and domestic animal health, agricultural systems, and wildlife populations.

Infection and mortality rates are extremely high, with most deaths caused by starvation or metastases and organ failure occurring within 6 months of tumor development. Since first observation in 1996, DFTD has rapidly spread throughout the natural range of Tasmanian devils and remains the primary conservation concern threatening this iconic species. DFTD's status as a transmissible cancer renders it an ideal candidate for integrative molecular analyses, as these techniques can elucidate origin, transmission mode, and mechanisms of immune evasion.\nCanine transmissible venereal tumor in dogs </td><td>implicated in driving amphibian declines on a global scale. Since formal description in 1997, chytridiomycosis has been documented in over 700 amphibian species with multiple fungal strains, interacting in a variety of environmental contexts. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is characterized by high levels of variability in morbidity and mortality of hosts. Integrative molecular analyses of chytridiomycosis can address the molecular bases of host resistance and tolerance, fungal virulence, and environmental mediation of disease progression, and ultimately lead to novel management strategies.\nPseudogymnoascus destructans causes\n</td></tr><tr><td>Bender et al. 2014; Pye et al. 2016 </td><td>white-nose syndrome in bats Van Rooij et al. 2015; Lips 2016\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "Figure 2.
