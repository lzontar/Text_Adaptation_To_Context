            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent for the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic, has caused a public health emergency. The need for additional research in viral pathogenesis is essential as the number of cases and deaths rise. Understanding the virus and its ability to cause disease has been the main focus of current literature; however, there is much unknown. Studies have revealed new findings related to the full transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its subsequent ability to cause infection by different means. The virus is hypothesized to be of increased virulence compared with previous coronavirus that caused epidemics, in part due to its overall structural integrity and resilience to inactivation. To date, many studies have discussed that the rationale behind its transmission potential is that viral RNA has unexpectedly been detected in multiple bodily fluids, with some samples having remained positive for extended periods of time. Additionally, the receptor by which the virus gains cellular entry, ACE2, has been found to be expressed in different human body systems, thereby potentiating its infection in those locations. In this evidence-based comprehensive review, we discuss various potential routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2-respiratory/droplet, indirect, fecal-oral, vertical, sexual, and ocular. Understanding these different routes is important as they pertain to clinical practice, especially in taking preventative measures to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

It is classified as a beta coronavirus, rendering mammalian hosts susceptible to infection. Six other coronaviruses have been identified to infect human hosts, resulting in epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1] . As of May 7, 2020, the global count has reached 3,672,238 confirmed cases with 254,045 COVID-19-related deaths [2] , causing growing public health concern. R t , the effective reproduction number, approximates the potential for a virus to spread given a specific measure of time in relation to control measures in place. As suggested by Inglesby in an article in JAMA, without measures such as social distancing in place, the R t is estimated to be similar to that of its value in January 2020 ranging between 2 and 4 [3] .",

SARS-CoV-2 was found to have one of the hardest outer protective shells among all coronaviruses. This is believed to result in more stable viral particles, resulting in its greater resilience in bodily fluid [4] . In a NEJM study, SARS-CoV-2 was found to remain viable, in aerosolized form for up to 3 h, and stable on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 h [5] . The virus was found to be more stable on smooth surfaces [6] . However, it should be noted that the findings presented are in the absence of in vivo data and based solely on a limited number of studies, potentially creating a gap in our understanding.",

ACE2 has been noted to be expressed in various tissues and organ systems throughout the body, including the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, heart, lung, testes, and kidney [9] [10] [11] .

A preprint study reported a COVID-19 patient with no urinary symptoms having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the urine [13] . One case report depicted a patient with meningitis/encephalitis associated with COVID-19, whereby SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [14] , whereas another study of pediatric COVID-19 patients showed that four patients with neurological symptoms had negative CSF samples for viral RNA [15] . A prospective study by Sun J et al. examining 49 COVID-19 patients in China noted that persistent prolonged viral RNA shedding has been detected in body fluids, particularly that of nasopharyngeal and fecal samples [16] . Additionally, while viral shedding has been widely noted, a study by Xiao et al. had successfully isolated infectious SARS-CoV-2 from fecal matter [17] . It is important to note that although quantitative viral RNA has been detected from various body sources, the ability to recover viable virus is of critical importance to understand transmission routes. As some of the studies included in this review lack this data, it may be very difficult to draw reasonable conclusions.",

Following the outbreak, it was suspected that the virus propagated by means of community and intrafamilial spread [20] . The transmission is thought to be predominately person to person, either by direct contact or through droplets originating from infected individuals [21] . Droplets can be formed through coughing, sneezing, singing, breathing, and speaking [22] . Droplet transmission involves exposing an entry point, such as mucosa (nose and mouth) or conjunctiva, to potentially infective respiratory droplets (typically > 5-10 \u03bcm in diameter) produced by someone having respiratory symptoms within a 1 m proximity [23] . The inhalation of small, exhaled respiratory droplets containing infectious virions is thought to occur; there is a growing concern for long-range human-to-human infection should these droplets remain airborne and viable [24] .",

Airborne transmission occurs when larger respiratory droplets, which have evaporated, or dust particles harbor microbes in the droplet nuclei with a size < 5 \u03bcm in diameter. This allows microbes to remain in the air for longer periods of time and travel greater than 1-m distance. Airborne transmission becomes a threat when aerosolization of particles takes place, especially in essential procedures such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation [23] . Liu et al. investigated the aerodynamic nature of the virus based on findings from hospitals in China. The concentration of viral RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low but elevated in toilet areas. Additionally, airborne viral RNA levels in the majority of public areas were undetectable with the exception of a few areas prone to crowding [26] .",

A study from the NEJM characterized the viability of the virus in multiple surfaces of inoculated samples, with their results indicating that indirect transmission by means of fomite and aerosolization was plausible [5] . In an early study by Cai et al., COVID-19 patients were tracked to identify their environmental exposures within a shopping mall. The findings suggested that viral spread was unlikely due to respiratory droplet transmission alone. Direct contact with other subjects, asymptomatic individuals, or exposure to contaminated environments accounted for transmission in some subjects [27] . Moriarty et al. highlighted the transmission potential of the virus on cruise ships totaling more than 800 confirmed cases; viral RNA was discovered on multiple surfaces of cabins in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals despite quarantining efforts, questioning the role of transmission by fomites [28] . Additionally, a preprint study conducted by Santarpia et al. highlights environmental viral shedding observed in 13 quarantined individuals in the USA; of 163 surface and aerosol samples collected, 126 (77.3%) tested positive by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, 80.4% of all room surface samples tested positive for the presence of viral RNA, supporting significant indirect contamination and likely airborne transmission [29] . It should be noted that to the best of our knowledge, no viable virus has been isolated from fomite samples indicating limited data on its transmissibility.",

Prolonged viral detection in stool samples has also been detected in pediatric patients following the recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia [32] . In another study involving pediatric COVID-19 patients postdischarge by Zhang et al., all subjects had positive stool RT-PCR results after 10 days, without positive throat swabs, clinical symptoms, or imaging findings [32] .

Samples were collected from the room of a patient whose fecal matter tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR prior to routine cleaning, including from the surface of the toilet bowl, inside of the bowl, and door handle-all of which tested positive.

In a clinical analysis of 10 neonates born from nine COVID-19 mothers by Zhu et al., it was found that perinatal infection of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to adverse effects in newborns, as some of the neonates experienced fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and even death [45] . A recent study in JAMA by Baud et al. depicted a case of miscarriage during the second trimester in a COVID-19 female related to placental infection with SARS-CoV-2. The fetal surface of the placenta tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; histopathology revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrates and funisitis. Although vertical transmission was not proven, no other etiology of fetal demise was identified [46] . Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 crosses the placental barrier.",

The study by Pan et al. also characterized that there was low overlapping gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human testes, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 would not likely be able to gain testicular cellular entry via this mechanism [47] .

Certain studies have noted the detection of viral RNA in conjunctival specimens, while others demonstrated limited evidence of its presence. A case study of an ocular manifestation of COVID-19 presenting as bilateral conjunctivitis 13 days after onset of illness suggested that viral shedding occurs in the eyes; RT-PCR of conjunctival samples on days 14 and 17 following the onset of symptoms tested positive. The conjunctiva was confirmed to be a site of viral replication when he tested positive via RT-PCR of consecutive conjunctival swabs. On day 19, the conjunctival swab specimen resulted negative [50] . Moreover, 38 COVID-19 patients at a hospital center in China were retrospectively reviewed for ocular manifestations; the study concluded that about one-third of patients with COVID-19 had ocular abnormalities, which frequently occurred in patients with more severe disease [51] . In a case series of 38 COVID-19 patients published in JAMA Ophthalmology, 31.6% (95% CI, 17.5-48.7) of subjects had ocular manifestations consistent with conjunctivitis such as conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, or increased secretions. Similar to the prior study, this more commonly occurred in patients with severe systemic manifestations or abnormal laboratory tests. There was a low prevalence of viral nucleotides in conjunctival specimens of 5.2% (95% CI, 0.6-17.8) [51] .",

In order to demonstrate that the ocular samples contained infectious virus, an RNA-positive ocular sample was inoculated in Vero E6 cells, with a cytopathic effect being observed 5 days later. Viral replication was confirmed via RT-PCR from purified RNA in the cell growth medium.

Likewise, patients with upper respiratory tract infections did not demonstrate any evidence of viral shedding in tears, suggesting that transmission through tears is likely low [54] . A couple of preprint studies have arrived at similar conclusions. In a study by Sun et al. involving 72 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, only two patients had conjunctivitis, but SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments were found in the ocular discharge of one of the two [55] . Another preprint study which was a retrospective cohort study enrolled 67 confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, of which 63 were laboratory confirmed. Of the 63 laboratory-confirmed patients, conjunctival specimens from one patient were positive on PCR testing and two patients had probable positive results-none of these three had ocular symptoms [56] .",

Emerging studies have detected the presence of viral RNA in multiple regions of the human body, raising concern for its ease of transmissibility. Thus far, COVID-19 was originally thought to be spread by respiratory droplets; however, newer studies have highlighted the potential for alternative routes. Detection of viral RNA shedding in multiple bodily fluids/samples suggests the potential for additional modes of transmission, such as bloodborne, urinary, and fecal-respiratory. Transmission by such means remains controversial given the limited supporting data for each mode. Clinicians should be aware that the detection of viral RNA in numerous bodily fluids can potentiate new routes of transmission as more data on SARS-CoV-2 emerges becoming more readily available.",

The role of whole genome sequencing in characterizing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 has been discussed as a comprehensive detection method. The limitations with this method include cost, time, and complications; however, it may play a part in elucidating further understanding of viral transmission pathways. As COVID-19 is not completely understood, the need for further research confirming and/or refuting these potential routes of transmission remains a priority.",
