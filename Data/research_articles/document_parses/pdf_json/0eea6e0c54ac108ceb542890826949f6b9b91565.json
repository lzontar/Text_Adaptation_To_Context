The purpose of the present work is to summarize the protocol of a multicenter, prospective cross-sectional study investigating pneumonia in children <14 years of age, aiming to identify the etiological agents and related determinants involved. Building upon the National Pediatric Research platform and Traditional Chinese Medicine Profession Special Purpose, established at the Affiliated Hospital to Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2015, a 1-year prospective study investigating the role of eight common viral respiratory pathogens and M. pneumoniae in the etiology of childhood CAP was conducted.

This prospective, hospital-based, multicenter study was conducted at 10 sites in nine cities: the Affiliated Hospital to Liaoning University Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shenyang, Dalian Children's Hospital, Beijing Children's Hospital of the Capital Medical University, two sites at Guangzhou: the Women and Children's Medical Center and the Affiliated Hospital to Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Long Hua Hospital at the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Affiliated Hospitals of the Shandong, Tianjin, Changchun, and Guangxi Universities of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

In the present study, multiple pathogens were detected in 18.5% of the children. Evidence of viral and M. pneumoniae co-infection was found in 14.7% of the children with pneumonia, a result which is in agreement with previous studies.38 Viral co-infections with other viruses have been demonstrated in childhood CAP, and this was also seen in this study, with cases of dual viruses, as well as three and four types of coexisting virus found. Another etiologic study of 840 children hospitalized with CAP in China showed a similar prevalence.42 Given the large proportion and diversity of co-detected pathogens, further study is needed.It is important to emphasize the limitations of this study. First, the limitation in this study was the diagnostic methods we used, the sensitivity of DFA is low compared with molecular assays, and could not detect the new viruses like human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human Bocavirus (hBoV), and human polyomavirus, which encountered in increasing frequency after using PCR as diagnostic tests.Second, owing to the weak diagnostic techniques, we did not includeCAP patients with bacterial infection who needed bacterial culture, which restrained the research of pathogen spectrum. Third, the detection of viral pathogens with the use of nasopharyngeal swabs could have represented infection limited to the upper respiratory tract; no attempt was made to collect samples from the lung by transthoracic needle aspiration considering the difficulty in obtaining appropriate lower respiratory tract specimens from children. In addition, only hospitalized children with CAP were studied and a study on outpatients might have given different results. Finally, although our multicenter study allowed for the investigation of diverse populations with standardized procedures, our findings may not be representative of the entire Chinese pediatric population and may not be generalizable to other settings. Positive viral specimen means apparent infection or inapparent infection. Some respiratory viruses, like Adenovirus or Epstein-barr virus (EBV), parasitized in the oropharynx in general condition and broke out into the hematological system to cause disease when the immunity was decreased or invasive therapy was used. Consequently, positive viral in the oropharynx does not mean that this virus is causing any respiratory infection, the patient's clinical symptoms, other auxiliary examinations were needed to be together think.In conclusion, pneumonia is a serious public health concern and a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Despite advances in microbiological diagnostic tests and prevention measures, pneumonia remains the main cause of death globally from infectious disease in children <5 years old. This study systematically investigated the frequency of nine respiratory etiologies of CAP in children ranging in age from 6 months to 14 years at a multicenter level. M. pneumoniae, RSV, and ADV were the most commonly detected causative agents identified. Effective antiviral vaccines or treatments, particularly for RSV and influenza virus infection, could have a mitigating effect on pneumonia in children. The burden of CAP in children was associated with multiple co-detected pathogens, underlining a need for the enhancement of sensitive, inexpensive, and rapid diagnostic tests to accurately identify pneumonia pathogens.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors thank Rongtao Shao, Zhenglong Guan, and Mingyue Xiao for the collection of clinical cases, and are grateful to the patients, without whom this study would not have been possible.
