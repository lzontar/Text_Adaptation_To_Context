After transmission of these parasites in the human host, male-female pairing is the key event for the development of female parasites. Female schistosomes from single sex infection are stunted in size and are sexually immature, and their successful development depends on their pairing with a male worm inside the gynaecophoral canal of the male worm [2] [3] . When paired female worms are separated from male worms, they stop laying eggs and regress to an immature state. However, when such immature females are allowed to couple, they maturate again [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , suggesting a specific interaction between male and female worms during such pairing, leading to the development of mature female worms. Different factors have been proposed for such sexual maturation. They include physical contact, nutrition [5, 7, 8] , chemical stimuli [9] [10] [11] and some polypeptides and proteins [8, [12] [13] [14] .

This might also be due to the difference in the habitat for parasite in culture and in the live host. Furthermore, the type and concentration of nutrients in media, culturing environment and the parasite density might have had some influence in pairing in vitro. To eliminate the influence of such intangible factors and to corroborate the in vitro result, siRNAs were administered in the mice infected with S. japonicum. Pereira et al.

In the present study, upon systemic administration of siRNA in the infected mice with S. japonicum, reductions in parasite pairing and burden were observed. Moreover, relatively better inhibition was observed in the 19 days group by injecting 2 -O-methyl modified siRNAs compared to unmodified siRNAs. This could be due to 2 -O-methyl modified siRNAs being more stable and resistant to nuclear degradation [38] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 150, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 769, "end": 773, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1077, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1486, "end": 1490, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We administered a double dose at 14 and 15 days post-infection in the 19 days groups because parasites usually initiate male-female pairing at that period of time.

It remains to be determined in future studies how much siRNA was taken up in the parasite. We also plan to determine the effect of SjGCP silencing and siRNA dosage for achieving the best inhibition of male-female pairing in infected mice.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To date, the most acceptable hypothesis concerning the biological functions of pairing is the separation of labour in sexually dimorphic schistosomes. The male schistosome ensures the survival of females by providing physical transportation and musculature to aid feeding and other maturation factors. SjGCP contains multiple short, conserved repeat regions with a sequence similar to the developmentally regulated neural cell adhesion molecule fisciclin I [28, 35] , suggesting that SjGCP may have implications for the development of schistosome. In the present study, we demonstrated that siRNA-mediated SjGCP silencing has an influence on early male-female pairing and on parasite burden in mice infected with S. japonicum. Our results show that SjGCP silencing led to a significant inhibition of parasite pairing (52% for unmodified siRNA and 74% for 2 -O-methyl modified siRNAs) in mice at 19 days post-infection. Although SjGCP has been significantly suppressed both at transcript and protein levels (Figures 4c and 4d) , there was only a 7.2% pairing inhibition at 32 days post-infection. Furthermore, the reduction of parasite burden increased to 36% instead. The significant reduction in parasite burden was also probably due to the fact that an unpairing parasite could not survive as a single adult parasite in a final host. Our results suggested that SjGCP likely plays multiple roles in the schistosome. SjGCP is likely to be involved in early male-female pairing. SjGCP also likely plays an important role in parasite development. The silencing of SjGCP could postpone parasite pairing and affect subsequent development. It will be interesting to further characterize the effect of SjGCP silencing on the development of the reproductive system, sexual maturation and/or egg production in schistosomes in future studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 457, "end": 461, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 462, "end": 465, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1006, "end": 1025, "text": "(Figures 4c and 4d)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, siRNAs targeting SjGCP silenced SjGCP at the transcript level as well as the protein level, eventually reducing parasite pairing and parasite burden in mice infected with S. japonicum.

Nonspecific protein-protein interactions were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS (pH = 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in primary antibodies: rabbit anti-SjGCP (Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, Shanghai, China) and antialpha tubulin (Beijing Zhongshan Biotechnology, Beijing, China) diluted 1 : 100 in blocking buffer, and washed five times for 5 min each in 0.1% Tween-20 PBS. The secondary antibodies (Kexin Bioscience, Beijing, China) were horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-[rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G]. They were diluted to 1 : 1000 in PBS, and incubated with the membrane for 1 h. The membrane was developed with 0.05% diaminobenzoic acid.At 7 days post-siRNA treatment, male schistosomes were analysed for immunofluorescence. Briefly, parasites were first fixed in ice-cold acetone for 5 min, dried, washed thrice with PBS (pH = 7.4) and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 1% goat serum for 30 min. Parasites were then incubated in rabbit anti-SjGCP antibodies at 1 : 10 dilution for 1 h at room temperature and washed thrice in PBS for 10 min. A 1 : 300 dilution of fluorescence-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was then added and incubated for 30 min. After multiple washings as described above, the parasites were mounted on slidesEffect of SjGCP silencing on male-female pairing At 7 days post-siRNA treatment, schistosomes were analysed for the RNAi effect on pairing by microscopical observation of the paired parasites. To eliminate other factors that have influenced on pairing, pairing was retested in three independent experiments.Four-to 6-week-old male Balb/c mice (mean weight 25 \u00b1 2 g) were purchased from the Shanghai Center for Experimental Animals and randomly divided into three groups: 19 days, 28 days and 32 days groups. Each group was subdivided into control, irrelevant siRNA treatment and SjGCP s1 siRNA treatment groups. Each mouse was challenged with 100 \u00b1 10 normal Schistosoma japonicum cercarie obtained from snails by abdominal skin penetration.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Effect of in vitro SjGCP inhibition on parasite pairing at 7 days post-siRNA treatment", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "We thank Mr Krishna Hari Bhandari and Dr Hong Liu for their valuable comments and help in preparing this manuscript.
