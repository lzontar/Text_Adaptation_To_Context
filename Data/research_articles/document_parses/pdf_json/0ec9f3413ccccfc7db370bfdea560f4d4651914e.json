[1] reported a timely study on the exclusion of non-English language reports in systematic reviews but cautiously generalized the implications to rapid reviews rather than systematic reviews. The results complement the guidance in the new edition of the Cochrane Handbook [2] . However, the time of publication of this report coincides with the COVID-19 outbreak that introduces a geographical bias toward the inclusion of non-English literature. Although many researchers will try to publish in English, literature in non-English should not be ignored. We also thought it will be an added value to share our other experiences on literature search for evidence synthesis on COVID-19.",

It is hard to describe and report such a thing in academic literature especially when journals' submission systems can mandate using at least five keywords to describe your work. As a result, researchers started creating names using terms related to geography (e.g., ''Wuahan Pneumonia''), some adding a date (''Coronavirus 2019''), and the others having a setting (''Wuhan Seafood Market Pneumonia Virus'').",

Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were being updated so frequently that it was hard to keep up. My colleague asked ''What if they change the Supplementary Concept tomorrow?'' Ironically, I had to change my search strategy the following day because MeSH changed the concept from ''Wuhan Coronavirus'' to ''Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2.'' Fortunately, NLM has documented these changes [5, 6] . When some of the Supplementary Concepts become a Subject Heading, they may change again. It may take decades until a well-known concept becomes a subject heading. Recent examples are ''Meta-Analysis'' and ''Systematic Reviews'' that were added to MeSH only in 2008 and 2019, respectively, when hitherto they were not even supplementary concepts.",

Apart from the fact that designing search strategies can be subjective and strategies may vary from one search expert to another, terminology is changing rapidly and search strategies that were accurate when first published can become unreliable and unable to retrieve relevant literature in a consistent manner. Although search experts rely on reported terms by the authors and indexing terms from indexing bodiesdboth shown to be insufficient for COVID-19dwe would all benefit from a single source of truth: a standardized and up-to-date way to find literature on a particular concept. Using a validated search filter could certainly help but the rapid growth of relevant literature and a lack of stable Subject Headings both mitigate against the reliability of this approach.",

In addition, databases may change their records and add, modify, or delete fields that necessitate changes to the syntax of search strategies. The need for living search strategies has always been there, but COVID-19 has brought this need into sharper focus. To date, there has been no open platform to develop living search strategies and search experts have become accustomed to writing searches using word processing programs and sharing them in text documents (e.g., spreadsheet or PDF) with all the limitations this implies [7] . 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56 As a response, we offer what may be the first living search strategy with live search results using the 2Dsearch platform.
