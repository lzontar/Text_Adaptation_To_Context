PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the alpha coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family [1] . The entire genome sequence of PEDV is approximately 28 kb, which consists of seven open reading frames, encoding four structural proteins [spike protein (S, 150-220 kDa), membrane protein (M, 20-30 kDa), envelope protein (E, 7 kDa), and nucleocapsid protein (N, 58 kDa)], and three non-structural proteins (replicases 1a and 1b and ORF3) [3] [4] [5] . PED was first reported in the United Kingdom in 1971 [6] . In 1978, PEDV was isolated in Belgium and named CV777 [1] . In China, a diarrheal disease caused by PEDV was first observed in 1973 [7] . Since the winter of 2010, large-scale outbreaks of PED caused by highly pathogenic PEDV strains have resulted in the death of a large number of pigs in south China [8, 9] . Subsequently, this highly pathogenic PEDV strains were discovered in other countries including the United States and South Korea, etc. [10] [11] [12] [13] . Since the 1990s, Both inactivated and live attenuated PEDV vaccines have been widely used to prevent dissemination of the virus in Asia, including CV777 strain-based inactivated or attenuated live vaccines and bivalent inactivated vaccine using attenuated PEDV and TGEV in China [14, 15] , the KPED-9 and DR13 strainbased attenuated live vaccines in South Korea [11, 16] , and the P-5 V strain-based live attenuated vaccine in Japan [17] . However, despite the emergence of China's current vaccine immunization strategy, multiple types of PEDV strains were still found in immunized swine herds [15, [18] [19] [20] [21] . An analysis of PEDV whole-genome differences whose sequences were available in GenBank indicated that four hypervariable regions were present in PEDV, comprising the C terminus of the nsp2 gene and the N terminus of the nsp3 gene, the Spike gene, the open reading frame 3 (ORF3), and the N gene region [22] . These gene mutations might alter the antigenicity of vaccines derived from classical attenuated vaccine strains and consequently resulted in inefficient vaccination in many pig farms [23] . At present, a variety of strains already exists in China, including classical strains (classical wild strains and classical attenuated vaccine strains, genotype 1) [23, 24] , highly virulent strains (genotype 2) [24] , the S-INDEL-PEDV strains (genotype 1b) [7, 25, 26] , recombinant variants of attenuated vaccine strains and wild-type strains [27, 28] , and the variant with a large deletion in the S1 N-terminal domain, etc. [29] . Moreover, multiple types of PEDV strains coexisted in the same environment and even co-infected the same pig [23] , with a potential risk of recombination between wild-type strain and the classical attenuated vaccine strain [27, 28] . This could potentially result in the enhancement of the recombinant attenuated vaccine strains in virulence and increase the difficulty of identifying different types of strains. Therefore, it was particularly important to establish a new detection method to distinguish PEDV classical attenuated vaccine strains and wild-type strains and to monitor the prevalence of classical attenuated vaccine strains in pigs and evaluate attenuated vaccine safety.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 141, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 142, "end": 144, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 280, "end": 283, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 624, "end": 627, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 628, "end": 631, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 632, "end": 635, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 691, "end": 694, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 751, "end": 754, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1002, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1003, "end": 1005, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1147, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1152, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1157, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1162, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1444, "end": 1448, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1452, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1531, "text": "[11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1535, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1602, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1759, "end": 1763, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1768, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1773, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1774, "end": 1778, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1783, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2088, "end": 2092, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2278, "end": 2282, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2449, "end": 2453, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2454, "end": 2457, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2497, "end": 2501, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2543, "end": 2546, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2547, "end": 2550, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2551, "end": 2554, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2634, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2635, "end": 2638, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2713, "end": 2717, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2829, "end": 2833, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2944, "end": 2948, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2949, "end": 2952, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "In recent years, the sequence characteristics of the spike (S) gene in PEDV strains, including insertion and deletion in the S gene (S-INDEL) and only the S1 deletion gene, have been used as genetic markers to distinguish to distinguish different types of PEDV strains [25, 29] .

Of the 12 samples that tested negative in the RT-PCR assay, 9 samples were negative and the other 3 were positive (one classical attenuated vaccine strain and two wild-type strains) as tested by the real time RT-RPA method, and 8 samples were negative and the other 4 were positive (one classical attenuated vaccine strain and three wild-type strains) as tested by the real time RT-PCR assay. All positive amplified products were sequenced, which confirmed the presence of PEDV in the samples and the viral load of all PEDV positive samples was measured by real-time RT-RPA method in this study (Fig. 5 ). The PEDV real-time RT-RPA method has highly positive diagnosis agreement with real-time RT-PCR (98.6%) and RT-PCR assays (95.8%). These indicated the high specificity and sensitivity of these assays. In addition, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine kobuvirus (PKV) were detected in the 8 PEDVnegative samples (data not shown). The growth curve for the PEDV classical attenuated vaccine strain CV777 in Vero-E6 cells determined by PEDV real-time RT-PCR, PEDV universal real-time RT-RPA, and PEDV vaccine real-time RT-RPA indicated that viruses replicated rapidly during the first 24 h post-infection (hpi), achieving the highest titer at approximately 36 hpi (Fig. 6) . The virus titer gradually decreased because Vero-E6 cells breakdown after 36 h. These results showed that real-time RT-PCR and real-time RT-RPA are two alternative assays for the differentiation and characterization of PEDV properties in Vero-E6 cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 360, "end": 369, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 967, "end": 974, "text": "(Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1655, "end": 1663, "text": "(Fig. 6)", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Phylogenetic tree analysis of PEDV strains in China demonstrated that the entire PEDV genomes evolved into two separate genogroups, GI (classical strains, GI-a and GI-b) and GII (variant strains) [25, 33] . Classical CV777 (accession number: AF353511) and DR13 (accession number: JQ023161) belonged to the GI-a subgroup. The GI-b subgroup included Vero cell-adapted vaccine strains (PEDV attenuated vaccine KC189944, attenuated CV777 and DR13) derived from classical strains, a recombinant Vero cell-adapted isolate (JS2008) of PEDV attenuated vaccine and mutants [27] , and four other Vero cell-adapted isolates (SDM, SQ2014, SC1402, HLJBY) [20, 25, [33] [34] [35] [36] . PEDV strains in the GI-b subgroup not only have nucleotide variations in the ORF3 or Spike gene [25, 29, 33] but also have 24-nt deletions of the nsp3 gene in the ORF1 region in our study (Fig. 1) . These nucleotides deletion in the ORF1 may have occurred in cell-adapted viruses during adaptation and attenuation through serial passage in Vero cells, which is identical to nucleotide deletion of Spike or ORF3 genes in the cell-adapted isolates and attenuated live vaccines [13, 16] , and thus would be unlikely to be detected in wild-type strains. Based on the above findings, a differential PEDV real-time RT-RPA method was established to distinguish PEDV classical attenuated vaccine strains from the wild-type strains. This method contained two real-time RT-RPAs, a universal real time RT-RPA assay targeting nucleocapsid gene was used to detect all types of PEDV strains and another PEDV vaccine real time RT-RPA could identity PEDV classical attenuated vaccine strains according to ORF1 24-nucleotides deletion region of three classical attenuated vaccine strains (PEDV attenuated vaccine KC189944, attenuated CV777 and DR13) and five Vero cell-adapted isolates (JS2008, SDM, SQ2014, SC1402, HLJBY) genome sequences, which were compared to 38 PEDV wild-type strains published by GenBank (Fig. 1 ). The two real-time RT-RPA assays have good specificity, with fluorescent signals only visible for PEDV positive RNA amplicons. The PEDV detection limits of both real-time RT-RPA assays were 10 2 copies, reflecting good sensitivity. Clinical samples tests indicated that the PEDV real-time RT-RPA method has a highly overall agreement with real-time RT-PCR (98.6%) and RT-PCR assays (95.8%) ( Table 2) , respectively, but require less than half the time of them, suggesting that the real-time RT-RPA method could be used as an alternative detection method. Sequencing results of 7 samples that were positive in the PEDV vaccine real time RT-RPA assay were the same as the nucleotide deletion positions of the ORF1 and ORF3 fragments in classical attenuated vaccine CV777. It is worth noting that among the seven classical attenuated vaccine strains in all samples, six were from the piglets that were orally inoculated with the classical attenuated vaccine CV777, and none of the live PEDV strain was successfully isolated in Vero-E6 cells. This may be because the stool samples contained less viral load or only contains nucleic acids. Due to ORF1 of some vaccine candidates have not been reported, especially the vaccine candidates from highly virulent strains (genotype 2a) emerged after 2010, we are not sure whether these vaccine candidates derived from non-classical attenuated vaccine strains have the same 24 nucleotides deletion of nsp3 gene in the ORF1. If these vaccine candidates do not have the 24 nt deletions pattern, they can not be detected by our method. Similarly, if the wild-type virus may repair the nsp3 gene 24-nt-deletion region of classical attenuated vaccine strain in a co-infection event, the 24 nucleotides-repaired strain not be detected by our method. Nevertheless, commercial vaccines widely used in pig farms of China are developed based on classical attenuated strains, while vaccines derived from non-classical attenuated vaccine candidates are being developed but not yet commercialized, our method is safe, accurate and reliable for the detection and identification of classical attenuated vaccine strains in pig farms. Therefore, our method can be used to distinguish classical attenuated vaccine strains and wild-type strains, while vaccine candidates derived from other nonclassical attenuated vaccine strains may not be detected. This real-time RT-RPA method was established to distinguish between classical attenuated vaccine strains that were artificially vaccinated and wild-type strain during epidemiological surveillance, thereby obtaining more accurate epidemiological data. Additionally, because the Real-time RT-RPA is more rapid than real-time RT-PCR and isothermal loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology. It is also more efficient, requiring only a pair of primers and a low running temperature (30-45\u00b0C) for a short period (20-40 min) [37] [38] [39] . This compares with LAMP requirements of 4-6 primers and a high running temperature (60\u00b0C) for 1 h [40] [41] [42] , and real-time RT-PCR of a pair of primers and a high running temperature (95\u00b0C) for over 1 h [43] . Additionally, there are no melting temperature requirements for RPA primers and probes because their annealing and elongation are enzyme-mediated rather than temperature-driven [39, 44] . Moreover, the combination of RPA and real-time fluorescence quantification with gel electrophoresis results in high simplicity, specificity, and accuracy [38, 39, 45] .
