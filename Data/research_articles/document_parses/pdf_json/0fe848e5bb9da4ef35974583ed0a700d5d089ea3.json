Its explosive growth is putting health care systems in jeopardy. The first French cases were diagnosed on January 24 th , 2020. On April 7 th , Europe had a substantial burden in terms of reported confirmed cases (686,338 cases with 52,809 deaths) (1) . Most SARS-Cov-2 infections (Coronavirus infection disease or COVID-19) are mild with influenza-like illness symptoms, anosmia and/or ageusia, but in a number of cases, a biphasic evolution has been reported, leading to hospitalisation (when hypoxia is severe), which can progress in some patients to mechanical ventilation in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (2) .",

Beside the staffing issue, one of the major problems was the lack of ICU machines, such as ventilators that were not easily available on the market. In this context, the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise d'anesth\u00e9sie et de r\u00e9animation [SFAR] ) stated that anaesthesia ventilators could be used to ensure prolonged ventilation on ICU patients under highly regulated conditions (4). Because literature on the subject is almost non-existent, we decided to design a retrospective, non-interventional study, with a non-inferiority criterion, to evaluate the feasibility of prolonged mechanical ventilation for ICU patients with anaesthesia ventilators (instead of ICU ventilators that are usually used). Although the study will have multiple centres, we first decided to analyse the first 20 patients of one centre, which is the subject of this letter. Ethics committee approval was obtained from the French-Language Society of Pneumology (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de pneumologie de langue fran\u00e7aise [SPLF]) (CEPRO 2020-017).",

However, this criterion was left to the physician's discretion if no other ventilators were available.

All parameters were prospectively collected over 3 days. A late time-point will be assessed at 28 days, although this data is not available for this preliminary report.

Patients were mostly male, with a median age of 60, 75% of them presented with at least one comorbidity, and 80% of them were COVID-19 positive. Among the 4 patients that were COVID-19 negative, septic shock was induced by Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, acute mesenteric ischemia or a postoperative pneumonia, the last one being hospitalised because of hypoxic cardiac arrest. Median delay between ICU and hospital admission was 0 day (only one patient had a 7 day delay). Our preliminary results on 20 patients show that only 2 patients (both COVID-19 positive) required ventilators shift to ICU ventilators during this period. Reasons for the change were the high plateau pressure or hypercapnia which could not be fixed by adjusting ventilator settings. Among the two patients, one ventilator had to be switched within 6 hours after mechanical ventilation initiation, whereas the second one was switched after 70 hours. Filter changes and water trap emptying were performed every 2 days and 1.5 days per mechanical ventilation day respectively (during the first 3 days). This frequency is similar to what is performed for ICU ventilators. We were only able to assess outcome at Day 7, with a 10% mortality rate. Nurses' work load was not increased by these ventilators use, although we decided to assign either anaesthesia nurses or nurses with previous training on these ventilators to be in charge of the patients.",

During a crisis when conventional ICU ventilators are lacking for ICU patients, anaesthesia ventilators can be used safely, provided strict adherence to the published recommendations is followed (4). Doctors and caregivers using them should also be trained to use them properly with adequate monitoring of filters and water-trap systems. Our results support the possible use of anaesthesia ventilators for ICU patients. More patients and/or further studies are required to definitively assess the performance and safety of the procedure.
