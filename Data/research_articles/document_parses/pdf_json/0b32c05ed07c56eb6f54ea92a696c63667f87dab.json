First off, it is necessary to separate damages attributable to the anthropogenic component of global warming and the global warming that is due to natural factors . If 90% of global warming is natural, then damages are essentially unavoidable and the bene fi ts of reducing human emissions of greenhouse gases, of CO 2 , are going to be small. However, if 90% or more of global warming can be attributed to human causes, the bene fi ts of avoiding damages will be much higher. The problem is that, as shown in earlier chapters, the contribution of natural versus human factors to global warming remains unknown -a source of speculation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Given scienti fi c uncertainties, it is not clear whether a particular future event, such as a drought , an unusual storm or an early spring (which negatively affects tree growth in boreal climes, for example), can be attributed to climate change of anthropogenic origin, or whether it is simply a natural occurrence well within the usual vagaries of weather patterns.

The scienti fi c uncertainties are enormous, but once the impacts are known, it is necessary to estimate the costs (or bene fi ts) of such changes and balance these damages against the costs of mitigating CO 2 emissions. It is quite possible that there is a socially optimal level of atmospheric CO 2 that is much higher than the current level, a point where the marginal bene fi ts of further reducing CO 2 emissions equal the marginal costs of doing so. Given wicked uncertainty, could we ever fi nd such an optimal point? Finally, there is the question of tipping points, which has become a cause de celebre among certain economists, particularly the UK's Sir Nicholas Stern ( 2007 ) and Harvard University's Martin Weitzman ( 2009a, b, c ) . One version of the story is that global warming will cause the boreal tundra to melt, thereby releasing vast amounts of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH 4 ). Once that happens, it is argued, run away global warming will take place. Therefore, based on the 'precautionary principle ,' it is necessary to take drastic action to control human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is important to note that arguments based on the precautionary principle (Chap. 6 ) cut both ways, as William Anderson ( 2010 ) , a philosopher from Harvard University, points out in a commentary on climategate . If drastic action is taken to curb human emissions, this could, for example, lead to political instability that results in a cataclysmic global con fl ict that must be avoided at all costs; therefore, we should not take drastic action to curb emissions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1039, "end": 1053, "text": "Stern ( 2007 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1110, "text": "Weitzman ( 2009a, b, c )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1272, "text": "(CH 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1633, "end": 1650, "text": "Anderson ( 2010 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Clearly, estimating the damages avoided by mitigating climate change is a much more dif fi cult and uncertain prospect than estimating costs, even though ascertaining costs is a dif fi cult enough task.

Bottom-up approaches determine the impacts of global warming at the sector, region or country level.

Such studies are somewhat speculative in the sense that climate change is about global trends in average temperatures and precipitation and not speci fi c details. But the main drawback of bottom-up estimates of climate-change damages is that they do not take into account adaptation and impacts elsewhere. Thus, while tourists may no longer visit one region, another region may see an increase in tourism. A reduction in crop yields in one region could be more than compensated for by increased yields in another region. Prices change which causes estimates of damage to change, but bottom-up approaches do not and cannot take price changes into account.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Top-down models are less detailed and, in that sense, less accurate in their estimates of damages.

This is what top-down models provide. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are a particular type of top-down model and they offer perhaps the best means for estimating global damages. IAMs are generally mathematical programming models that seek to optimize an objective function subject to static and dynamic constraints.

Sea level rise, health and biodiversity in particular are considered to be particularly vulnerable to global warming and thus to lead to large estimated costs if climate change occurs. In agriculture and forestry, sophisticated modeling and statistical methods have been used to determine damages from climate change, but even such estimates remain highly speculative.

One should also note that estimates of damages likely have little relation to a particular policy, such as the Kyoto Protocol , which actually did little to prevent global warming. Nor do all authors come to the conclusion that climate change will only lead to large reductions in overall global well being, although there is agreement that some regions will lose while others gain.

Observed land values re fl ect the fact that land rents diverge as a result of different growing conditions, soil characteristics, nearness to shipping points, and so on. Since producers face nearly the same output price, differences in land prices are the result of differences in the Ricardian or differential rents, which, in turn, are attributable to the various factors affecting production.

When annual precipitation increases beyond P 1 (associated with point A), crop production is the alternative land use that provides the highest rents. To the right of A, landowners will cultivate land and grow crops to achieve higher net returns to the land. Rents to crop production are even higher on land parcels that experience more rainfall. If too much rain falls, however, the land yields a greater rent in forestry -beyond P 2 (point B) rents in crop production are lower than those when the same land is in forestry. Points A and B represent intensive margins , precipitation thresholds where land use changes, while a and b represent extensive margins for land uses crop production and forestry, respectively, because rent to those land uses falls below zero if precipitation is below those thresholds.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 40, "end": 46, "text": "Fig. 7", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Hedonic Pricing: Ricardian Land Use Models"}, {"text": "The Ricardian approach assumes that a landowner experiences average annual precipitation of P 0 before climate change occurs.

The climate and control variables constitute the explanatory variables or regressors. Once the model parameters have been estimated for a sample of farms for which actual sales data are available, the results are fi rst used to predict the farmland values across the entire study region or country.

The model implicitly assumes that, if landowners face different climate conditions, they will choose the agricultural land use (crop and technique) that maximizes their net returns.

Further, there is no reason to suppose that the estimated parameters will continue to hold under a changed climate regime, which might be the case if growing conditions under a future climate regime are outside observed values (which increases uncertainty of predicted values); it is also dif fi cult to use hedonic models estimated for a current period to project how the same land might be used some 50-100 years later.

In the winter of 1973-1974, abnormally heavy ice cover in the eastern Beaufort Sea resulted in a major decline in polar bear numbers (as reported in Armstrong et al. 2008 , p.386) . Thus, both more ice cover as well as less cover appear to be harmful to polar bears. of calculation is dangerous because it is likely that people are willing to pay that amount to protect all mega fauna , not just polar bears. Alternatively, one might think of the $180 billion as a one-time payment to protect global biodiversity against loss due to climate change (given that biodiversity and mega fauna are closely related in such valuations). In that case, the sum might seem small. In that case, the guaranteed survival of polar bears might only garner a payment of several hundred million dollars, still a signi fi cant amount.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1297, "end": 1327, "text": "Armstrong et al. 2008 , p.386)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Biodiversity and Ecosystems"}, {"text": "Yet, there remain caveats.

The latter is a good source of data. calculating a trend. Further, these extreme weather events also disrupted the leveling of equipment. As a result, readings from years characterized by cyclones and tsunamis, and until the equipment could be tested and recalibrated, affected the calculation of trends.

However, when a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, it may be classed as an extreme climate event, perhaps associated with anomalies in SSTs (such as an El Ni\u00f1o )\" (IPCC WGI 2007 , p.310) . Notice that the IPCC leaves room to interpret extreme weather events as attributable to global warming, presumably the result of human emission of greenhouse gases. Yet, rather than making a statement that rules out a link between climate change and extreme weather events, the IPCC prefers to leave open to interpretation the potential that any single extreme weather event is part of a pattern that could be attributed to global warming. 23 23 In the Third Assessment Report of 2001, the IPCC points out that there is no evidence of increased storm events (IPCC WGI 2001 , pp.162-163, p.664 ) and, despite progress in climate modeling , current GCM models are not up to predicting increased future storm or weather events (IPCC WGI 2001 , pp.573-575) . It is unlikely that much has changed in the intervening 6 years to convince scientists otherwise (although see below). ( 2009 ) Few reasonable scientists would attribute individual weather events, whether extreme or not, to global warming simply because it is impossible, as the IPCC recognizes, to determine whether the event would not have occurred had there been no change in climate whatsoever. Consider the probability that a particular weather event occurs, say a category 4 hurricane weather event (see Table 7 .2 ). Suppose that, on average, 40 storms develop in a particular hurricane season (June 1 through November 30) in the North Atlantic and that the current probability of a storm of a particular intensity is given in the second to last column of Table 7 .2 . Thus, only 40% of storms develop into hurricanes, many of which are unlikely to make landfall. Using these assumptions, in any given hurricane season, one expects there might be one storm that reaches category 5, between fi ve and six that attain a category 3 or 4 rating, four category 2 hurricanes, six category 1 hurricanes, and some 24 other tropical storms or depressions.

Yes, there is a slight increase in nearly every category of weather event, but it would require many years of observations to determine whether any given weather event had been drawn from one of the following three probability distributions: (1) the original distribution where the mean number of storms events per year was 40; (2) the original distribution but with a mean of 45 annual storm events; or (3) the after-warming probability distributions, with an annual average of 45 storm events and distribution of storm events given by the last column of Table 7 .2 .

In conclusion, despite our fi nding that rising global temperatures appear to affect storm activity in the North Atlantic, there is no similar evidence for this from the Paci fi c Ocean, and there is no evidence that the number of storms impacting the U.S. has increased as a result of climate change. Further, the regression analyses indicate that other factors not considered here are more important determinants of storm activity. Overall, however, one must conclude that there is no convincing evidence that extreme weather events are impacted by climate change. More information must be gathered before any such conclusion can be reached, and that might well take another 50 years of observations. Nonetheless, two studies recently examined the impact of human activities on the incidence of extreme precipitation events using output from climate models (Min et al. 2011 ; Pall et al. 2011 ) . Using Hadley Centre , grid-point data on 1-day and 5-day precipitation accumulation events for 49 years and precipitation outputs from an ensemble of climate models for the same gridpoints and years, Min et al. ( 2011 ) fi nd that the model outputs track actual precipitation extremes rather closely when climate model outputs are based on CO 2 than when CO 2 is absent from such simulations. The authors conclude that this shows human activities are responsible for extreme weather events. Pall et al. (2011) consider the probability that fl oods in England and Wales during autumn 2000 were the result of anthropogenic climate change. The authors used forecasts from the Hadley climate model to obtain temperature and precipitation forecasts; these forecasts were fed into a precipitation-runoff model to simulate daily river runoff and the potential and magnitude of fl oods. The climate model was run using sea surface temperature s, atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and sea ice levels found in year 2000 and again with conditions as they existed (or were presumed to exist) in 1900. In each case, the climate model was run several thousand times for a full year, with runs differing according to their starting values. The authors concluded: \"The precise magnitude of the anthropogenic contribution remains uncertain, but in nine out of ten cases \u2026 results indicate that twentieth century anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions increased the risk of fl oods occurring in England and Wales in autumn 2000 by more than 20%, and in two out of three cases by more than 90%.\"", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1278, "end": 1296, "text": "(Min et al. 2011 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1313, "text": "Pall et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1537, "text": "Min et al.

The 1973 ban on DDT is considered by some to have led directly to the death of more than 90 million people, if one assumes some 2.5 million people per year die of malaria. This is the legacy some have attributed to the 1962 best-selling book, Silent Spring , by Rachel Carson who was not a scientist but an excellent writer. 29 The link between DDT and declining populations of bald eagles has subsequently been proven false. First, it appears that bald eagles were nearly hunted to extinction, with concern expressed as early as 1921. A total ban on hunting was put in place in the U.S. with the Bald Eagle Protection Act (1940) . As a consequence populations began to rise, with Marvin ( 1964 ) reporting that overall bird populations had risen by 25% between 1941 and 1960, including the particularly vulnerable robin despite many years of DDT spraying. Various studies indicated that DDT did not have an adverse impact on bald eagles, nor was there evidence that thin egg shells were correlated with DDT (see Coon et al. 1970 ; Reichel et al. 1969 ) . Cromartie et al. ( 1974 ) found that, in a sample of 37 bald eagles found dead in 1971-1972, 13 had been shot and 13 had died of insecticide poisoning (dieldrin and thallium), but no deaths were directly attributable to DDE ( Dichloro-diphenyldichloro-ethylene ), which is a form of DDT. Likewise, Belisle et al. ( 1972 ) found that, in a sample of 39 bald eagles found dead in 1969-1970, only one died from DDE, 18 had been shot and 6 died from dieldrin, an alternative insecticide to DDT. See also E.J. Gordon and S. Milloy, \"100 Things You Should Know about DDT\" at http://www.junkscience.com/ddtfaq.html (viewed May 25, 2010 ). Yet, a Google search of DDT and bald eagles fi nds that the majority of websites (mainly associated with environmental groups) maintain that DDT almost led to the demise of the eagle, when the scienti fi c literature attributes the cause to legal and later illegal hunting. 7.1 The Climate Damages Landscape has effectively been decoupled (Gething et al. 2010 ; Spielman and D'Antonio 2001 ) . This makes economic estimates based on coupled climate-biology models of potential damages from malaria in a warmer world extremely speculative, and certainly orders of magnitude higher than warranted by empirical observations (Gething et al. 2010 ) .

(Whether carbon taxes or cap-and-trade are a better way to deal with global warming is discussed further in Chap. 8 .) A carbon tax could theoretically lead to higher wellbeing as the economic distortions caused by other taxes would be reduced -the so-called 'doubledividend' of a green tax; it would also increase employment (see Bovenberg and Goulder 1996 ) . As the work of Nordhaus indicates, the optimal policy would be to impose a carbon tax set low to begin with and then slowly increased over time. One compelling reason for a tax is to avoid getting locked into an emission-reduction technology that might prove inferior to another option yet to be developed. For example, one might not want to lock into the internal combustion engine by promoting and subsidizing production of ethanol and biodiesel, with its production facilities and transportation networks, in case a much better option, such as an electric vehicle capable of going 300 km or more on a single charge, should come along. Doing so might be prohibitively expensive and militate against the very development of such an electric vehicle. 33 Two unrelated events changed the foregoing consensus among economists that the optimal tax should begin at a low rate and ramp up slowly over time. First was the publication of the Stern Report (Stern 2007 ) . 34 Contrary to all previous economic analyses (e.g., Kennedy 1999 Kennedy , 2002 Nordhaus 1994 ; van Kooten 2004 ) , the Stern Report fi nds that the bene fi ts of severely restricting CO 2 emissions today exceed the costs of doing so; there is no ramping up policy, only the conclusion that immediate severe restrictions on CO 2 emissions are warranted. The reasons are soon apparent, but they are rooted in the cost-bene fi t approach used in the Report, and particularly regarding the appropriate discount rate to apply in cost-bene fi t analysis . 33 An overview of the state of electric car s is found in The Economist (September 5, 2009, pp.75-77) . The main obstacle remains the battery, although new battery-automobile technologies are potentially capable of 200 km on a single charge (although current vehicles such as GM's Chevy Volt can only go about 60 km). Along with infrastructure that permits quick recharging or exchange of batteries, innovations in auto design to take advantage of electric motors, and economic and institutional innovations (e.g., separating ownership of batteries and vehicles), it could well be that the electric motor replaces the internal combustion engine for land transportation. 34 The report was prepared for the British government by civil servants under the guidance of Sir Nicholas Stern , a well known economist.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 547, "end": 575, "text": "Bovenberg and Goulder 1996 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1331, "text": "33", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1539, "text": "(Stern 2007 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1607, "text": "Kennedy 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1622, "text": "Kennedy , 2002", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1638, "text": "Nordhaus 1994 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1656, "text": "van Kooten 2004 )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2096, "text": "33", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2195, "text": "(September 5, 2009, pp.75-77)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2766, "text": "34", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Economic Consensus Breaks Down"}, {"text": "Stern does not reject the notion of discounting, because it only makes sense when comparing viable alternatives with different fl ows of costs and bene fi ts over time, but he relies on a very low 1.4% rate of discount , which is determined as the rate of growth in per capita consumption plus 0.1% (Mendelsohn 2006 ) .

According to Antarctic ice core data reported by Dieter et al. (2008) , current atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 are the highest ever recorded in the past perhaps 850,000 years, and the current rate of increase in atmospheric CO 2 is historically unprecedented. This unprecedented increase can only be attributed to human causes according to Weitzman and others. 2. There are 22 studies reported in Table 9 .3 and Box 10.2 of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC WGI 2007 , pp.721-722, pp.798-799) . These studies report probability density functions (PDFs) with high probabilities of large temperature rise. Weitzman sums the reported PDFs into a single PDF using what he calls a meta-analysis based on Bayesian model averaging. From the meta-derived single PDF, Weitzman fi nds that the probability that the temperature increase exceeds 7\u00b0C is 5%, or that P( s* \u00b3 7\u00b0C) = P( D T \u00b3 7\u00b0C) = 0.05, and P( D T \u00b3 10\u00b0C) = 0.01. This is the feedback effect of CO 2 warming on water vapor discussed earlier. 3. Next, he assumes that the higher temperatures brought about by increased concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 will cause permafrost and boggy soils to release methane , thereby amplifying global warming beyond even the water vapor feedback. The possibility that this feedback effect takes place is discussed by Scheffer et al. ( 2006 ) , Matthews and Keith ( 2007 ) ), and The Economist (1 August 2009, p.70) . 36 The possibility of such a feedback effect leads Weitzman to increase the value of the climate scaling multiplier s m so that, based on information from Torn and Harte ( 2006 ) , the probability that temperatures could rise above 11.5\u00b0C is 5% and that they could rise above 22.6\u00b0C is 1%, or P( s m \u00b3 11.5\u00b0C) = P( D T \u00b3 11.5\u00b0C) = 5% 36 These feedbacks ignore others in the climate system. Without a natural greenhouse gas effect, the Earth's surface temperature would be about 18\u00b0C; with it, but without any feedbacks, it would be about 60\u00b0C; with feedbacks, it is about 15\u00b0C. In the natural system, then, feedbacks eliminate 68% of GHG warming -that is, negative feedbacks outweigh positive ones. But the climate models used by the IPCC assume that positive feedbacks outweigh the negative ones -precisely the opposite of what is found in nature. The result of Spencer 's and Lindzen's and others' studies (noted in Chap. 4) is generally that climate sensitivity s 2\u00d7CO2 is about 0.5\u00b0C instead of the IPCC's midrange of 3.0\u00b0C. That, in turn, greatly diminishes the probabilities of 10 and 20\u00b0C warming. and P( s m \u00b3 22.6\u00b0C) = P( D T \u00b3 22.6\u00b0C) = 1%. However, recognizing the crude and speculative nature of his calculations, Weitzman rounds this down: there is a 5% probability that the expected increase in temperature exceeds 10\u00b0C and a 1% probability that it exceeds 20\u00b0C -that is, P( D T \u00b3 10\u00b0C) = 5% and P( D T \u00b3 20\u00b0C) = 1%. 4. Finally, given the potential for huge increases in temperature, Weitzman argues that economic damage (utility) functions parameterized on the basis of current fl uctuations in temperature make no sense. Recall that William Nordhaus uses a quadratic damage function: D ( T ) = bT + cT 2 , where T is temperature as before, and a particular parameterization is given in Table 7 .7 . But Weitzman argues that it should be exponential, so that D ( T ) = e f(T ) , where f ( T ) = bT + cT 2 , or some other function. Clearly, the exponential damage function results in much higher damages the farther into the future one projects rising temperatures.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 52, "end": 72, "text": "Dieter et al.

Because energy is the most important driver of development, reducing the ability of poor people to access cheap energy serves only to keep them poor. Mitigation policies slow the economic growth of developing (and developed) countries, but will prevent the increased mortality associated with climate change. Without mitigation, on the other hand, real per capita incomes of poor people will rise to such an extent that poverty is eliminated. Based on historical evidence, this will lead to large reductions in mortality from almost all causes. As indicated in this chapter, because the Earth's poorest are projected to have high per capita incomes in the absence of action to mitigate climate change, the overall bene fi ts of allowing climate change to occur might well exceed those of taking action and keeping countries in poverty. This provides one explanation why developing countries are not keen on taking action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions if this in any way slows economic growth.

Levitt and Dubner ( 2009 ) point out that it is potentially possible to spray sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere using a specialized 'hose' in the sense of a garden hose and suggest that such a device could be located near Fort McMurray, Alberta -Canada's oil sands where sulfur and energy are readily available and the location is suited to having SO 2 circulate throughout Earth's entire upper atmosphere, thereby reducing warming.
