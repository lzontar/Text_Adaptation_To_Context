Using access to open-source data for three-dimensional printing, ventilator splitters can be rapidly produced at any location to allow multiple patients to share a single ventilator in disaster situations. The original ventilator circuit splitting solution has been previously described 1 and was implemented during the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. 2 A three-dimensional printable Y-piece (Y-splitter), with an optional inspiratory limb flow limiter to account for differential lung compliance, can function to divide the ventilator's inspiratory and expiratory limbs among patients, based on Neyman and Irvin's concept (figs. 1, 2, and 3). Ideally, patients with comparable lung compliance are paired together. More than two patients may be theoretically possible with nesting additional Y-splitters. However, the required flow may exceed ventilator capacity. With advances in additive manufacturing and the widespread accessibility of three-dimensional printers, local production bypasses global travel barriers or supply chain breakdown.",

First, there is a risk of cross-contamination between patients connected to the same ventilator; this can be mitigated with inline filtration. Second, the patients sharing the ventilator must be in close proximity to the machine, which will be restricted to the length of the ventilator tubing. This is a concern where positive cases require airborne or contact isolation. Third, the patients must be paralyzed to facilitate a controlled mode of ventilation. Additionally, to ventilate multiple patients with the same settings, several parameters need to be considered such as patient size, ideal body weight, lung compliance, mode of ventilation, etc. Individualized adjustments are possible with flow limiters but also possibly imprecise.",
