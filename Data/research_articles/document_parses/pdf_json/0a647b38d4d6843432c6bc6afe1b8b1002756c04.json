Within the S-protein, the receptor docking domain has a higher divergence, with four out of five critical ACE-2 interacting amino acid residues replaced in the SARS CoV-2.

Indeed, studies by Zhou et al. using cells expressing human ACE-2 confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 could infect cells via the same protein on ACE-2 as SARS-CoV did [2] .
