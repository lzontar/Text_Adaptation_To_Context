However, the virus is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets and environmental surfaces. It can cause severe lower respiratory illnesses like pneumonia, resulting in death. The large percentage of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 are among older individuals, aged 65 and above. However, younger people are getting infected by the virus at higher rates. 3 In the absence of vaccine availability, measures such as safe physical distancing and banning gathering are primary preventative measures in reducing the spread of infection and flattening the epidemiological curve. 4 About 63% of the US counties are classified as rural. However, only 15% of the US population live in rural areas. 5 The rural population is mostly white, poor, older, has higher smoking rates, high blood pressure, and high rates of obesity as compared to their urban counterparts. 5 The mortality rates from heart disease, cancer, respiratory diseases, and stroke are higher among people living in the rural areas as compared to those living in the urban areas. 6, 7 The first reported case of COVID-19 in a rural county was on February 20 in Humboldt County, Northern California. 8 There are growing signs that the COVID-19 virus has started to spread to rural areas. 9 Most rural areas lack public health infrastructure, and the current health care system, which is already stretched and lacks resources, may not be ready to deal with the sudden influx of patients. 10, 11 We used crowdsourced data, and spatiotemporal Bayesian models 12, 13 to (1) estimate and compare the county-wise change in prevalence rates of COVID-19 by rural-urban status, (2) identify hotspots based on estimated prevalence rates, (3) find the association of demographic, smoking, and chronic diseases with COVID-19 prevalence rates and how they vary by rural/urban designation of counties, and (4) identify counties showing a significant increase or decrease of the percentage change in prevalence rates over 14 days.
