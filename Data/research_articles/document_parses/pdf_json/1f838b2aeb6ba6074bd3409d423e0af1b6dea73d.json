            "text": "Congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CHD-PAH) is one of the major complications in patients with CHD. A timely closure of the left-to-right shunt will generally result in the normalization of the pulmonary hemodynamics, but a few patients have severe prognosis in their early childhood. We hypothesized that wide-ranging pathological mechanism in PAH could elucidate the clinical state of severe CHD-PAH. Using electronic medical records, we retrospectively analyzed six infants with severe CHD-PAH who had treatment-resistant PH. All patients were born with congenital malformation syndrome. After starting on a pulmonary vasodilator, five of the six patients developed complications including pulmonary edema and interstitial lung disease (ILD), and four patients had alveolar hemorrhage. After steroid therapy, the clinical condition improved in four patients, but two patients died. The autopsy findings in one of the deceased patients indicated the presence of recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary venous hypertension, ILD, and PAH. Based on the clinical course of these CHD-PAH in patients and the literature, CHD-PAH can occur with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD)/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), ILD, and/or alveolar hemorrhage. The severity of CHD-PAH may depend on a genetic disorder, respiratory infection, and upper airway stenosis. Additionally, pulmonary vasodilators may be involved in the development of PVOD/PCH and ILD. When patients with CHD-PAH show unexpected deterioration, clinicians should consider complications associated with PVOD/PCH and/or pulmonary disease. In addition, the choice of upfront combination therapy for pediatric patients with CHD-PAH should be selected carefully.",

PAH and PVOD/PCH can overlap pathologically and genetically [4, 5] . In addition, PVOD/PCH was reclassified as \"PAH with overt features of venous/capillary (PVOD/PCH) involvement\" in the latest World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) in 2018 [6] . The revised classification reveals that PAH has a more extensive clinical course than previously anticipated.

At 1-month-old medical checkup, she had poor weight gain, poor feeding, and a specific appearance suggestive of trisomy 21. The chromosomal examination confirmed trisomy 21. She was referred to the pediatric cardiology outpatient clinic, and was diagnosed with complete atrioventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and PH. Cardiac catheterization was performed at 56 days of age; her left-ventricular pressure (systolic/end-diastolic) was 51/8 mmHg, right-ventricular pressure (systolic/end-diastolic) was 53/7 mmHg, main pulmonary arterial pressure (systolic/diastolic/mean) was 49/14/31 mmHg, pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio was 1.91, and pulmonary vascular resistance was 4.81 Wood units\u00b7m 2 . At 64 days of age, intracardiac repair and PDA ligation were performed. Postoperatively, her right-ventricular pressure estimated by ultrasonic echocardiography was still very high and almost equal to the left-ventricular pressure. She required nitric oxide (NO) inhalation even after endotracheal extubation at 77 days of age. At 95 days of age, NO inhalation was stopped and she had a cough and labored breathing. Decreasing the amount of milk feeding and increasing the dose of diuretics improved her respiration only temporarily. Her chest X-ray showed interstitial markings, so intravenous prednisolone was started at 110 days of age, and her respiratory status dramatically improved. We switched intravenous prednisolone to oral prednisolone on the next day. However, we suspected that severe PAH still remained, so at 113 days of age, oral bosentan was started. At 120 days of Male VACTERL association VSD, PAPVC None age, prominent labored breathing and hypoxemia started. Intravenous dexamethasone improved her condition temporally, but labored breathing and hypoxemia remained. At 139 days of age, she developed acute bronchitis and underwent endotracheal intubation. Intravenous dexamethasone and ampicillin improved her condition temporally. Her chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed panlobular ground-glass opacity and interlobular septal thickening ( Fig. 1 ). At 176 days of age, her respiratory status deteriorated further, so we started methylprednisolone pulse therapy in the intensive-care unit. Subsequently, she developed alveolar hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock and died at 181 days of age. A lung autopsy was performed after obtaining informed consent from her parents. Histopathological findings showed narrowing and obstructive small pulmonary arteries with medial thickening, hemosiderin deposition, lymphangiectasia, many emphysematous bullae, fibrous thickening of the cell walls, and intimal fibrous thickening of almost 50% of the pulmonary veins ( Fig. 2a-d) . These findings indicated the presence of recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary venous hypertension, ILD, and PAH.",

Just after birth, he was diagnosed as having ventricular septal defect (VSD) and aortopulmonary window (AP window). At 6 days of age, he underwent AP window repair. At that time, we did not perform VSD closure or pulmonary artery banding (PAB) because the main pulmonary artery was hypoplastic and seemed to restrict pulmonary arterial flow. The chromosomal examination revealed that he had trisomy 21. He was discharged at 76 days of age. However, during regular visits, the ultrasound cardiogram revealed reduction in pulmonary artery flow velocity, and progression of PH was suspected. Therefore, at 156 days of age, oral bosentan and home oxygen therapy were started. Bosentan was switched to macitentan at 160 days of age. Subsequently, he developed cyanosis and respiratory failure, and was admitted to the hospital as an emergency at 166 days of age.

His second CT scan revealed dilated pulmonary arteries, proximally to distally (Fig. 3b) . We considered that the high flow status was caused by VSD and that pulmonary vasodilators induced alveolar hemorrhage and respiratory failure; accordingly, we stopped the vasodilators gradually and performed PAB at 199 days of age. Postoperatively, the amount of bloody sputum gradually reduced, and the follow-up CT scan showed a dramatic improvement over the previous findings (Fig. 3c) .

However, it is difficult to assess these biomarkers in children. Although HRCT is also known to be useful for diagnosing PVOD/PCH, the characteristic findings are not present in all cases of PVOD/PCH. In addition, it is challenging to diagnose PVOD/PCH in children, because the lung volume is relatively small for HRCT analysis. However, we consider that the HRCT and pathological findings in our cases may indicate the possibility of PVOD/PCH coexistence. Besides, in our CHD-PAH cases, we used specific pulmonary vasodilators for deteriorating conditions; their clinical conditions worsened, and they developed pulmonary edema. This phenomenon strongly indicated PVOD/PCH. Muneuchi et al. also reported an infant with CHD-PAH; she died of unexpected deterioration of PH, and lung autopsy proved the existence of PVOD [7] . The frequency of pediatric PAH with The HRCT image of patient 4 shows panlobular ground-glass opacity, mild interlobular septal thickening, and funicular shadows. c In patient 5 image, only atelectasis and funicular shadows are shown. d Patient 6 image demonstrates ground-glass opacity, interlobular septal thickening, air space consolidation, and atelectasis.

            "text": "Trisomy 21 is frequently associated with chronic upper respiratory tract obstruction, sleep apnea syndrome, and hypoxia, caused by infection. These can also be associated with alveolar capillary dysplasia and peripheral lung cysts, and the condition can cause lung dysplasia [8, 9] . Emphysematous lesions and interstitial lesions can destroy the pulmonary vessels, with deterioration of PH. In addition to trisomy 21, trisomy 13; trisomy 18; DiGeorge syndrome; VACTERL association; and Noonan syndrome also tend to be complicated with CHD-PAH [10, 11] . CHD-PAH in combination with these genetic syndromes can cause deterioration of a patient's clinical condition. However, there are a few reports about CHD-PAH with congenital malformations besides trisomy 21. Further pathological analysis is necessary. 2. Overlap of pathology with PH: The findings of PVOD/ PCH can be seen in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema [12, 13] . PVOD can also induce fibrosis of lung interstitium [2] . Similar to the relationship between PAH and PVOD/PCH, that between ILD and PVOD/PCH may be less distinct than we think. 3. Relationship between PH and alveolar hemorrhage: It has been reported that hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the sputum of patients with PVOD is found significantly at higher rates compared with the other forms of PH [14] . Lederer et al. argued that engorgement of the capillaries in PVOD leads to occult alveolar hemorrhage. Additionally, pulmonary edema can cause diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and repetitive alveolar hemorrhages can induce interstitial fibrosis of the lung [15] . Furthermore, pulmonary vasodilators may cause alveolar hemorrhage. It has been revealed that epoprostenol, with anticoagulant therapy, increases one's risk of lung hemorrhage, and sildenafil can induce pulmonary hemorrhage [16] [17] [18] [19] . Physicians should be cautious about the risk of alveolar hemorrhage and ILD when treating patients with PAH and PVOD/PCH.",

Namely, CHD-PAH, PVOD/PCH, ILD, and alveolar hemorrhage can overlap each other, based on congenital malformation syndrome, respiratory infection, upper airway obstruction, pulmonary vasodilators, and so on. Pulmonary vasodilators can induce pulmonary edema in patients with PVOD/PCH and cause deterioration of PVOD/PCH and ILD. Physicians should consider that pediatric patients with severe CHD-PAH may be complicated with congenital malformation syndrome, other forms of PH caused by PVOD/PCH, or pulmonary disease, and select their treatment carefully. Making a differential diagnosis is sometimes difficult, especially in severe cases. Based on our experience, HRCT and the serum KL-6 level are useful for supporting the diagnosis. The serum KL-6 level is a serum marker for ILD, but it is known to increase in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Kida et al. reported that patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage whose serum KL-6 level was higher than 700 U/mL had a significantly poorer prognosis than other patients [26] .",

Unlike those pulmonary vasodilators, NO does not reach a region with a low-ventilation perfusion ratio and dilate only vessels in a region with a high-ventilation perfusion ratio. It has the advantage of improving general hypoxia. Furthermore, it was reported that in experiments on animals, NO inhalation decreased pulmonary arterial resistance and pulmonary vein resistance [27] . In addition, NO inhalation decreased pulmonary vein resistance and pulmonary capillary pressure in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [28, 29] . These reports suggest that NO inhalation is useful for PVOD/PCH. When the medical status of patients with CHD-PAH deteriorates even if pulmonary vasodilators are started or the dose is increased, physicians should consider not only the possibility of the limited efficacy of pulmonary vasodilators but also complications of other clinical conditions, such as PVOD/PCH, ILD, and alveolar hemorrhage. The therapeutic strategy of combining multiple pulmonary vasodilators, the so-called combination therapy, is recognized as the standard treatment for adult patients with PAH. Based on the current study, however, careful judgment is needed when choosing combination therapy, especially upfront combination therapy for CHD-PAH, because it may deteriorate the patient's medical status. Further discussion is necessary to determine the proper use of upfront combination therapy for CHD-PAH, and the conclusion should be clearly described in the guideline for managing childhood PH.",
