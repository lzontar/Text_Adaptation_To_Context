Lockdown measures have provoked a disruption of daily life with a great impact over older adults' health and well-being. Nevertheless, eudaimonic well-being plays a protective role in confronting adverse circumstances, such as the COVID-19 situation. This study aims to assess the association between age and psychological well-being (personal growth and purpose in life). Young-old (60-70 years) and old-old (71-80 years) communitydwelling Spaniards (N = 878) completed a survey and reported on their sociodemographic characteristics and their levels of health, COVID-19 stress-related, appraisal, and personal resources. Old-old did not evidence poorer psychological well-being than young-old. Age has only a negative impact on personal growth. The results also suggest that the nature of the COVID-19 impact (except for the loss of a loved one) may not be as relevant for the older adults' well-being as their appraisals and personal resources for managing COVIDrelated problems. In addition, these results suggest that some sociodemographic and health-related variables have an impact on older adults' well-being. Thus, perceived-health, family functioning, resilience, gratitude, and acceptance had significant associations with both personal growth and purpose in life.

Personal growth (the extent to which individuals develop potential by growing and expanding as a person) and purpose in life (viewing one's life as having meaning, direction, and goals) are the core components of positive psychological functioning. Personal growth and purpose in life seem to decline with age when older, young, or midlife adults are compared (Ryff, 2014 , Ryff & Keyes, 1995 .

First, this study has a non-probability sampling that future research should try to overcome, obtaining longitudinal data to facilitate the generalization of the results. Second, we only included two dimensions from Ryff's psychological well-being scales (purpose in life and personal growth). Nonetheless, the inclusion of these two subscales has been done before because they have been identified as the core components of psychological functioning and widely recognized as integral components of eudaimonia (Streib et al., 2010) . Third, these findings are limited to community-dwelling older-adults, without severe cognitive impairment and who were able and willing to complete the survey. Consequently, the results likely underestimate the impact of cognitive impairment or long-term facilities on Spanish older adults' well-being. Further research is needed to assess well-being in older adults with severe cognitive impairment, and living in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. Finally, data were self-reported, and this can have increased participants' social desirability. Future studies could include other reliable measures, such as participants' objective health features (accompanying diseases affecting somatic or neuropsychiatric functioning, concomitant medication, etc.) provided by healthcare professionals. Despite these limitations, our results do not show evidence that old-old have poorer psychological well-being than young-old. Age has only a significant impact on personal growth. The results also suggest that the nature of the COVID-19 impact (except for the loss of a loved one) may not be as important for the older adults' well-being as their appraisals and personal resources for managing COVID-related problems.
