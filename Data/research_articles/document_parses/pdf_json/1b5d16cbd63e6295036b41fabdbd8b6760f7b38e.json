Examples are outbreaks of zoonoses. One very recent example is the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak in the People's Republic of China. Zoonoses are also a widespread problem in animal husbandry [1] . This group encompasses diseases which can be transferred between animals (usually vertebrates) and between animals and humans. They are transmitted through zoonotic agents (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) [2] [3] [4] . Examples of bacterial zoonoses are the infections caused by Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever), Mycobacterium bovis (bovine tuberculosis), and by species of the Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), and Escherichia (Escherichiasis) genus [2, 5] . These diseases are of potential risk for humans and livestock of farms. Poon et al. show that early-stage detection of coronaviruses positively influence the survival chances of patients [6] . An outbreak among the livestock of a farm is often disastrous to the owner of that farm, and for people living in the proximity of that farm [7] . Often, more animals of the livestock are infected and the whole livestock is exterminated out of precaution, which could lead to bankruptcy of the farmer. Therefore, early-stage detection of this group of diseases, and other diseases as well, is often the key to save lives and livestock. As these diseases are also encountered at remote locations and in developing countries, it is desired that such detection equipment is portable and as cheap as possible.

Almassian et al. give a comprehensive overview of different possible heating methods in their review paper [12] . Not all of the mentioned methods are easy to implement in low-cost and portable lab-on-a-chip devices due to their bulkiness or implementation costs. Examples of these rather difficult methods are using heating via induction, infrared, or microwave radiation. Others are not useful due ot their challenging temperature control, like with heating up the system using exothermic reactions. Within the field of DNA amplification, different mechanisms of amplification exist. Some are based on thermo cycling processes, e.g., PCR, whereas others are isothermal. The use of an isothermal amplification technique puts less requirements on the heaters. Isothermal processes are either truly isothermal or consisting of three different temperatures, as they have a thermal denaturation step before and a termination step after the elongation step. The switching between these temperature steps does not have to be as fast as with thermal cycling steps in, for example, PCR amplification reactions. The use of less temperature variations makes it easier to maintain the set temperature as there is less heating an cooling involved. Furthermore, it eliminates the use of a continuous flow approach in systems with low thermal conductivities, e.g., polymers. Therefore, it is easier to implement within lab-on-a-chip devices [17, 21] . Isothermal DNA amplification reactions can already be performed by putting the chip on a commercially available hotplate [22, 23] or Peltier elements [24, 25] . However, these heating systems are bulky and power-consuming. Therefore, they are not useful for portable equipment or operation at remote locations. Miniaturizing heaters lowers the bulkiness and power consumption. Miniaturized heaters can be integrated as integrated resistive heaters, e.g., as deposited thin-film metal [26] [27] [28] [29] or as laminated Cu foil [30] , or as micro-Peltier elements [31, 32] . These miniaturized heaters can be implemented directly onto the microfluidic chip [28] or on a different substrate and leter incorporated onto the microfluidic chip [33] [34] [35] [36] . The geometry of such a heater contributes significantly to the uniformity of the heat distribution within the chip [26, 37] . One method to accurately control the temperature is the use of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controlled thermostat. These PID controllers are coupled to the electrical heaters and use a thermocouple as feedback-loop to the controller [22] [23] [24] [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 174, "end": 178, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1499, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1503, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1631, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1632, "end": 1635, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1660, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1664, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 1994, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1995, "end": 1999, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2004, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2009, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2038, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2070, "end": 2074, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2075, "end": 2078, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2163, "end": 2167, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2250, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2251, "end": 2255, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2256, "end": 2260, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2261, "end": 2265, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2387, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2391, "text": "37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2639, "end": 2643, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2644, "end": 2648, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2649, "end": 2653, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2654, "end": 2658, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "State-of-the-Art"}, {"text": "There are various materials that can be used to fabricate lab-on-a-chip devices for DNA or RNA amplification. In the past 15 years, more than ten polymers, ceramic materials, and metals have successfully been used to fabricate such devices [15] . The major property playing a role here is the biocompatibility of the material. The surface of the microfluidic structure should not inhibit the amplification reaction. This biocompatibility can be an intrinsic property of the material or the surface can be modified or coated to achieve this [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . One often used material is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [22, 23, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38] , which can be processed using soft lithography [39] . However, this is a fabrication technology used in academia and is not suitable for upscaling to mass production [40] . Fabrication methods suitable for mass production are thermoforming/embossing or injection molding [41] . One of the materials which is biocompatible and suitable for both industrial scale fabrication technologies is cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) [42] , which is one of the materials used in the past as well [28, 36, [43] [44] [45] . Guckenberger et al. estimates the costs of injection molding of only 50 simple microfluidic devices on $47, but this becomes cheaper when the mass production stage is reached [41] .

The use of an isothermal amplification technique also simplifies the final device and lowers its footprint, as there are no pumps required.

After the WGA is performed, a sequence specific amplification can be done since the quality the amplified DNA by MDA is very high [53] . The amplification reaction is illustrated below in Figure 1 (the contour of the amplified sequence is highlighted in black for clarity). Starting with a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule, a denaturation step at 95 \u2022 C is required, giving the random hexamer-primers and the \u03c629 DNA polymerase access to the bases of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) strands. The hexamers anneal themself to aleatory parts of the ssDNA sequence. These hexamers work as initiation sites for the \u03c629 DNA polymerases. After denaturation at 95 \u2022 C, the mixture is cooled down to ice temperature and the rest of the reagents are added. The mixture is heated up to~30 \u2022 C so the polymerase starts to complete the complementary ssDNA sequence, creating again a dsDNA strand, eventually it encounters a hexamer from another annealing site. Once this happens the polymerase will lift up that hexamer and starts to separate the amplified sequence formed from that annealing site. As the polymerase displaces the formed strand ahead of it, it continues to complete the sequence. The displaced strand becomes a new ssDNA strand and therefore, it gives new sites for more primers to attach and initiation sites for the polymerase, continuing the amplification, and thus creating a web of DNA strands.

Values for \u03ba i can be found in Appendix B. From Equation (3), the product R th \u00d7 A can be defined as the sum of 1 /h and l i/\u03ba i . Based on this summation, one can conclude that the convective heat transfer to the air is the most present heat transfer mechanism within the system (begin almost a factor 100 higher than the heat lost in the COC and H 2 O). This is also evident from solving Equation (2) for every individual temperature differences within the system and also including convective heat transfer directly from the heater into the air. If a heated area of 7.7 mm by 10.1 mm is assumed, which covers both the reaction chamber and the temperature monitor chamber, and a system consisting of 1 mm COC-0.5 mm H 2 O-0.1 mm COC is assumed, than the heater temperatures and powers in Table 1 are required. These are all in the workable range when a COC of a proper grade is chosen (e.g., TOPAS 6017 has a T g of 170 \u2022 C). The only side note here is that at higher temperatures, the temperature gradient through the system also becomes larger. This can be eliminated by using double-sided heating, like Chung et al. [28] . To determine the optimal heater width and heater spacing in the heated area, a parametric study using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3a finite element method simulations with the Heat Transfer in Solids (ht) package is done (COMSOL Inc., Burlington, MA, USA). The model is designed such that it consists of two parallel rectangles of COC (in the real device, the upper plate is an adhesive PCR foil) with H 2 O in between. The meandering heater are assumed to be lines at the bottom side of the layer stack. This reduces the required complexity of the mesh tremendously, as the heater in the real device will be approximately 100 nm in thickness. The heater temperature is set at a constant temperature of 303.15 K. This makes the heater material independent and the model purely focused on the heat transfer inside the COC-H 2 O-COC stack. All used values and equations are given in Appendix B. The layer stack is meshed with an extremely fine mapped mesh consisting of 280.650 elements with average quality of 0.9966. A parametric sweep from 0.3 mm to 2.0 mm, in steps of 0.1 mm, is done for both the heater width (w heater ) and the heater spacing (s heater ), giving 324 combinations. The simulations are solved by using the fully coupled, direct Pardiso solver on a custom-build and 40% CPU overclocked simulation computer, containing the equipment listed in Table 2 . To validate whether the metal tracks can withstand the required current, a quick analysis is done for the four extreme cases (i.e., w heater of 0.3 mm and 2.0 mm and s heater of 0.3 mm and 2.0 mm). In the same heated area of 7.7 mm by 10.1 mm a 100 nm (t heater ) thick heater track consisting of rectangles is assumed. The total amount of large and smaller interconnecting rectangles for all 4 cases is estimated in Table 3 . Based on the polynomial approximation equations for the resistivity of Au and Pt (\u03c1 res,i , where i is either Au or Pt) which COMSOL MultiPhysics 5.3a uses (Equations (4) and (5)) and Equation (6) an estimation is made for the required input currents and the created current densities (defined as I i/A cross\u2212section , in A m \u22122 ) when the heater is operated at 129.4 mW to get a temperature of 95 \u2022 C.

Injection molded COC plates (10 cm by 10 cm and 1.5 mm thickness) of the grade TOPAS 6017 (see Figure 4a ) are obtained via Kunststoff-Zentrum Leipzig (Kunststoff-Zentrum gGmbH, Leipzig, Germany). This grade is chosen because of its high norbornene content, giving it a relatively high T g of 170 \u2022 C. This minimizes the chance of melting during the milling process and decreases the chance of heater failure due to a deforming substrate during operation of the heater [28] . The microfluidic structure explained in Section 2.1 is CNC-milled using a Mikron WF 21C milling machine (Mikron SA Agno, Agno, Switzerland), as can be seen in Figure 4b . Milling is a very fast prototyping technique and chosen because of its flexibility [41] . The milling creates a surface roughness, which increases the surface-area-to-volume ratio. This roughness increases the chance of inhibition during the amplification due to the interaction of the used chemicals with the surface [44] . It also causes a considerable loss of optical transparency, which could obstruct the potential use of in situ fluorescence detection in future devices. Therefore, a chemical post-treatment with cyclohexane vapor is done (see Figure 4c ).

Guckenberger et al. mention production costs of $ 47 per simple microfluidic device when only 50 pieces are fabricated [41] . This price is expected to drop drastically when large numbers are fabricated. A metal is deposited on the backside of the substrate using two laser-cut metal (Mo) shadow masks to outline the shape of the resistive heater (see Figure 4d ).

As can be seen from the results in Figure 6 , a combination of small heater widths and heater spacings will result in smaller temperature differences inside the reaction mixture. This is evident as smaller heater spacings will result in a better coverage of the heated area by heater material. The smaller heater widths will result in a smaller heater cross-sectional area, and thus can be operated at lower powers, as is evident from Equation (1). Resulting in the fact that a densely packed meander structure with small heater widths and small heater spacings can dissipate more heat into the system. 3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 Based on these results and its simplicity, a meandering heater pattern of a heater with a width of 0.3 mm and a spacing of 0.3 mm in between the lines is designed.

After separation, ssDNA binding proteins hybridize on the ssDNA strands for stabilization, ensuring that the next primer will have time to bind to the ssDNA stripe and a DNA polymerase will extend the primers with the complementary bases. This method is a truly isothermal technique in which the separation of the dsDNA can be performed at the same temperature as the amplification reaction, i.e., 64 \u2022 C [9] . LAMP is more similar to MDA in the way it also uses heat to denature the dsDNA. After denaturation, a set of four primers (six can be used as well to achieve better selectivity) and a DNA polymerase is used at isothermal conditions (65 \u2022 C) to amplify the DNA [11] . When used in combination with reverse transcriptase, LAMP becomes a RNA amplification method, which could be used for RNA-containing viruses [11] , like virus-based zoonoses diseases as the corona viruses [22] .
