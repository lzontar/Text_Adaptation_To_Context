Design: Analysis of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 Twitter data in the Symplur Signals Database between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020. Setting: Social media platform Twitter. Patients: None. Interventions: Promotion of the joint usage of #PedsICU and #COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care. Measurements and Main Results: We collected data on all tweets containing the hashtag #PedsICU in addition to those containing both #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. Tweets including #PedsICU were shared 49,865 times on six continents between February 1, 2020, and May 1, 2020; between February 1 and March 13, only 8% of #PedsICU tweets included a coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag. After a sharp rise during the week of March 14, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 content has dominated the #PedsICU conversation on Twitter, comprising 69% of both #PedsICU tweets and impressions (p < 0.001). The most commonly used coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag over the study period was #COVID19 (69%). Proportionately, a greater percentage of #PedsICU tweets including the coronavirus disease 2019 hashtag (vs not) had images or videos (45% vs 41%; p < 0.001). In addition, non-physician healthcare providers were the largest group of users (46%) of the combination of #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags. The most popular tweets shared on Twitter were open-access resources, including links for updated literature, narrative reviews, and educational videos relevant to coronavirus disease 2019 clinical care. Concurrent hashtags and words in tweets containing #PedsICU and coronavirus disease 2019 hashtags spanned several different disciplines and topics in pediatric critical care. Conclusion: Twitter has been used widely for real-time information sharing and collaboration among the international pediatric critical care community during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Targeted use of #PedsICU and #COVID19 for engagement on Twitter is a conduit to combat misinformation and optimize reach to pediatric critical care stakeholders across the globe when rapid dissemination is needed. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2020; XX:00-00) Key Words: coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; critical care; pandemic; pediatrics; social media; Twitter N ever has there been a more important need for rapid information dissemination in the 21st century than during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic. At the time of this writing in early May 2020, COVID-19 infections have surpassed 3.8 million people globally, with over 260,000 deaths (1). Since its origin as an epidemic in China in December 2019 (2), information guiding critical care practice has been growing and changing each day, with anecdotal and case series data providing the foundation of therapeutic guidance for clinicians fighting the disease worldwide. In response, journals have made rapid peer review and publication of COVID-19 literature a high priority. However, for clinicians trying to establish best clinical practice, keeping up with that literature and the wealth of information from critical care colleagues across the globe, while balancing high acuity and clinical responsibilities, can be overwhelming. In any emergency mass critical care event, as in COVID-19, a comprehensive approach to education is needed to ensure preparedness (3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2724, "end": 2727, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3651, "end": 3654, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The international pediatric critical care community is dealing with multiple unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic (4, 5) .

Because of disproportionately increased resource needs in adult ICUs, many staff from PICUs have been deployed to care for adult COVID-19 patients. In fact, several PICUs have already transitioned to being ICUs for adults to meet the needs of adult COVID-19 ICU care (10) .

Most recently, reports of a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiple organ failure in previously asymptomatic children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are emerging in the United Kingdom and across the world (11) .

These tweets have resulted in over 44 million potential views on Twitter. The promotion of #PedsICU with #COVID19 as an informationsharing strategy on Twitter immediately after the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic was associated with markedly increased engagement by pediatric critical care stakeholders worldwide through the consistent use of common hashtags. As evidenced by the growth in unique participants, our study highlights the influence of social media on rapid dissemination of information as well as strategies for deploying reliable information from trusted sources to a wide spectrum of PICU stakeholders. With regard to information sharing, social media is the great equalizer. Across community and academic hospitals and all resource levels, social media provides an instant conduit to educational information from across the globe. As COVID-19 evolved and spread across continents, international and national stakeholder organizations (e.g., @WHO, @CDCgov), news outlets, and individuals began using social media to share information broadly. Clinicians began sharing their perspectives and experiences with treating COVID-19 in countries most stricken by the disease, including Italy, Spain, and the United States. Although much of this content is relevant to the #PedsICU community, having a direct connection to the most relevant and timely content is ideal. The wide variability of hashtags often used for the same topic makes searching for content on Twitter difficult (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww. com/PCC/B388). Therefore, the introduction and wide dissemination of #COVID19 for concurrent use with #PedsICU established a conduit for all PICU stakeholders to share and access relevant information easily, which is reflected by the number of unique users tripling the week of March 14 when the WHO declared a global pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The increase in new unique users engaged in #PedsICU COVID-19 tweets since March 14 highlights an important difference between social media use during conferences, that is, \"live-tweeting the meeting,\" and information dissemination during a pandemic.

As #PedsICU influencers share these studies with their followers, a virtual library is created that updates automatically and is accessible to all. COVID-19 tweets were more likely to include media and links than other #PedsICU tweets, suggesting that sharing clinical updates and literature in real time plays an important role in the conversation. As an example, the tweet with highest engagement during the study period was an urgent alert from the Pediatric Intensive Care Society (@PICSociety) in the United Kingdom with an image announcing an observed rise in SARS-CoV-2-related inflammatory syndromes, which was shared over 3,500 times (Fig. 5) .

A March 2020 study that investigated misinformation on Twitter surrounding the then-Coronavirus epidemic found that 25% of tweets contained misinformation and that 17% had unverifiable information, mostly from individual users (22) . As a smaller medical community, pediatric critical care medicine may potentially benefit from a lower risk of misinformation. However, critical evaluation of social media content is always recommended. Social media users can curate their content by carefully considering the individuals and organizations that they follow and engage with. Thus, our network analysis (Fig. 1) provides a broad range of individual and organizational stakeholders with consistent engagement in #PedsICU and COVID-19-related topics for new social media users to consider following. This group represents PICU stakeholders across six continents and, in addition to individual interprofessional clinicians, includes large organizations (@SCCM, @WFPICCS, @OpenPediatrics, @ESPNIC_Society), journals (@PedCritCareMed, @Crit CareExplore), and research networks (@paccman_asia, @LARednetwork). More recently, the Pediatric Overflow Planning Contingency Network (@POPCoRNetwork) has provided pediatricians, including PICU clinicians, streamlined access to networking and educational resources to facilitate care of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals and groups likely represent sources of reliable and verifiable information in a time when the spread of misinformation is a critically important consideration.
