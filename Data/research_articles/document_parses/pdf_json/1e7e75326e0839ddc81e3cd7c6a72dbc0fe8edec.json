Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the lung tissues distant from the tumors were reviewed. For patient 1, there was a wide range of lung interstitial inflammation with numerous infiltrating immune cells seen under the microscope. The infiltrating cells were mainly composed of plasma cells and macrophages, but lymphocytes were rare. Thickened alveolar septum and fibrous connective tissue proliferation were noted. Besides that, there were a large number of macrophages and foam cells in the alveolar cavities, but no evident pneumocyte hyperplasia was observed. Moreover, no obvious viral inclusion bodies and hyaline membrane were found ( Fig. 2A and  B) . The other six patients had no evident inflammation in their lung tissues distant from the tumors (Fig. 2C-H) .",

Although the laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection was obtained on postoperative day 5, the clinical course of patient 1 revealed that the patient had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the surgery. By retrospectively examining his clinical manifestations, we found that the patient immediately developed a fever (38.5 C) just 3 hours after the surgery and had recurrent pyrexia (>39 C) in the whole postoperative period. Chest CT scan on postoperative day 4 revealed diffused GGOs in bilateral lungs. As the pneumonia rapidly worsened, the patient died on day 5 after the surgery. We also reviewed the CT scan image of the patient performed 2 weeks before the surgery and noticed a subpleural ground-glass attenuation in the right lower lobe in addition to the diffusely infiltrative opacifications in the subpleural regions of both lungs, which were previously associated with interstitial lung disease. At that time, there was lack of awareness of the significance of the ground-glass findings.",

The pathologic pattern of COVID-19 pneumonia in patient 1 differs from that of the two cases reported by Tian et al. 3 Given that patient 1 had interstitial lung disease, the pathologic changes may be affected by this pulmonary comorbidity. Taken together, the lesson from patient 1 indicates that it is vitally important to perform careful preoperative examination and screening for those patients who plan to undergo an operation during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

Thus, the presence of typical GGOs, especially in the lobe contralateral to the surgery side, could be an early radiologic sign of the viral infection.",

These five patients with lung cancer had lower probability of severe COVID-19 than those with other types of cancer (20% versus 62%, respectively). Nevertheless, the lower incidence of severe COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer should be interpreted with caution because of the small sampling. In our report, six patients had lung cancer, and two of them died. Some considerations also need to be taken into account in interpreting the findings from the current report. First, the effects of different surgery patterns, including operation approach and lymphadenectomy on COVID-19, remain to be evaluated. Second, whether the characteristics of the cancer, such as histologic type and stage, could influence the development and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer needs to be further investigated. For now, two patients are still hospitalized, and further follow-up is needed to clarify the long-term outcomes of such specific patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

A comprehensive analysis of nosocomial infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome in a tertiary hospital in South Korea revealed that the virus transmissions mainly occurred before the infected patient had been recognized. 16 In our department, nosocomial transmission could be definitively proven on the basis of timing and pattern of exposure to infected patients and subsequent development of infection among the medical staff. On the basis of the investigation, patient 1 was presumed to be the source of transmission in our department because he was the first confirmed case in the ward and three health care workers who had close contact with him were found to be infected. Subsequently, six patients and another five health care workers were confirmed infected with COVID-19. The cross-infection highlighted the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a thoracic surgery department. As there are more aerosolgenerating procedures performed, such as lung suctioning, intubation, and bronchoscopy, in the thoracic surgery department, the medical staff has a high risk of exposure to droplets around the patients.",
