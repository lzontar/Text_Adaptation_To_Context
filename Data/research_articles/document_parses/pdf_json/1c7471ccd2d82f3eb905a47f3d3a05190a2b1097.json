Getting Brexit done appealed to a significant bloc of voters who saw a hung Parliament as 'worrying, depressing or despairing'. Moreover, by an 11-percentage-point margin voters saw a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn as a worse outcome than leaving the European Union (Ashcroft 2019). The Brexit slogan was used to counterattack the big spending policies that Labour promised to end what it described as nine years of economic austerity. When social policies were raised with Johnson, he would typically argue that after Brexit the UK would no longer be contributing billions of pounds a year to the EU budget and this money could be spent on improving health care, education and other popular services. As a form of political rhetoric, it linked the party's pro-Brexit stance with support for popular social policies. Johnson was correct to emphasise that after paying a \u00a339 billion divorce bill to the EU the UK would no longer have to make a \u00a313 billion annual contribution as well.

This would allow gradual divergence between Britain and EU economies in ways that Westminster believes would increase British competitiveness and that the EU fears would do so by undercutting EU standards. It also wants to avoid giving the EU an effective means of enforcing equivalence. This would allow the EU to make a unilateral judgement that British regulations were not equivalent to EU standards, thereby reducing EU imports from Britain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Leaving the EU Does Not Get Brexit Done"}, {"text": "In order to prevent the departure of the UK from harming integration, the EU does not want to allow a post-Brexit Britain to 'cherry-pick', that is, enjoy the same relationship as it had as a member state while being free of obligations.

If this deadline is not extended and no agreement can be reached, Brexit ends with no deal, thereby maximising the effect of breaking links developed in the 47 years in which the UK was a member of the European Union. In accepting the British deadline, EU officials have cautioned that it makes likely a 'barebones' Political Agreement that minimises the extent to which benefits can be secured. The coronavirus crisis, which has frustrated negotiations, gives him reason to seek an extension. Given Johnson's Houdini-like skill in dealing with promises, he could alter his position to take into account Brussels' red lines. Alternatively, to meet his self-imposed deadline he could emulate Candide and tell Parliament that whatever agreement he reaches with Brussels will deliver the best of all possible Brexits in the best of all possible worlds. A third option would be to invoke the spirit of Dunkirk and claim that no deal is better than surrender to the demands of a united European Union.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Leaving the EU Does Not Get Brexit Done"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "My Final Election Dashboard.
