Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 is likely exacerbated by reduced myeloid cell antigen presenting cell (APC) function or availability in the elderly (Zhao et al., 2011) .

Critical (ICU) and fatal outcomes are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6 (Giamarellos- Bourboulis et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2020) Vaccine development against acute viral infections classically focuses on vaccine-elicited recapitulation of the type of protective immune response elicited by natural infection. Such foundational knowledge is currently missing for COVID-19, including how the balance and the phenotypes of responding cells vary as a function of disease course and severity.

Utilizing bioinformatic approaches, we identified specific peptides in SARS-CoV-2 with increased probability of being T cell targets (Grifoni et al., 2020) . We previously developed the megapool (MP) approach to allow simultaneous testing of large numbers of epitopes. By this technique, numerous epitopes are solubilized, pooled and relyophilized to avoid cell toxicity problems . These MPs have been used in human T cell studies of a number of indications, including allergies (Hinz et al., 2016) , tuberculosis , tetanus, pertussis (Bancroft et al., 2016; da Silva Antunes et al., 2017) and dengue virus, for both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes (Grifoni et al., 2017; Weiskopf et al., 2015) .

The prediction strategy utilized is geared to capture ~50% of the total response (Dhanda et al., 2018; Paul et al., 2015) and was designed and validated to predict dominant epitopes independently of ethnicity and HLA polymorphism.
