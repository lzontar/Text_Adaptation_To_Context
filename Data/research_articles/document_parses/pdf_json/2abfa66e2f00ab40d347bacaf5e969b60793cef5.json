Its deficiency is generally associated with a negative impact on overall health, increased susceptibility to disease, and infections [9-12]. In the absence of reliable methods to assess the Zn status of a population, the deficiency or inadequacy in a population is estimated by combining the dietary intake by a population as per FAO's Food Balance Sheet and the estimated prevalence of stunting [10, 11, 13, 14] . Among micronutrients associated with good health, the deficiency of Zinc is quite prevalent ranging from about 5-50 % of the population [13]. Its high prevalence is associated with increased susceptibility to diseases, mental capacity, complications, high morbidity, and mortality in mothers and neonates [9,10]. Given its role in the overall human health and wellbeing, the countries have tried to overcome the problem through fortification of foods [9,10,12,13]. The countries from the high-income group that consumes a more diverse micronutrient-rich diet tend to have Zinc deficiency below 5-10 percent [13, 14] .",

If the observed correlation is to be believed as having cause and effect relationship, it may be predicted that the inherently or transiently higher Zinc levels resulting from supplementation or medication may be associated with higher COVID-19 infections and mortality in patients. A scrutiny of the COVID-19 patients' data for potential Zinc status alteration, such as resulting from the intake of vitamin C, organic acids, animal protein, phytate content along with Zinc supplementation and the administration of Zn status altering drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine would shed light on the biological significance of the observed covariation of the Zinc deficiency prevalence with COVID-19 cases and mortality in different target populations and its potential preventive role. So, more evidence-gathering follow-up exercises for the closer scrutiny of the COVID-19 patients' medical records, including the micronutrient supplementation and food consumption details is advisable to ascertain the role of Zinc deficiency in COVID-19 pandemic and potentially find an early solution to COVID-19.",
