Financial crises in the 19th and early 20th caused a challenging situation for economies, and it led to a massive interest in economic and financial analysis. In this situation, any information that provides a better understanding to the behavior of markets is highly critical. Among many types of research concerning data mining in time series (see- [4, 7, 9, 10] ); One of the key applications in this field [11] is stock data mining. Assessing time series similarity, i.e., the degree to which a given time series resembles another one is a core to many mining, retrieval, clustering, and classification tasks [18] . In the construction of financial portfolios (see [5] ), diversification, which conveys investing in a variety of assets, is a key to reduce the risk of a chosen portfolio. Thus, identifying stocks that share similar behavior is vital. There is no straightforward approach, known as the best measure for assessing the similarities in time series. Surprisingly, many simple approaches like simple euclidean distance can outperform the most complicated approaches [18] . Wang et al., in 2013 , perform an extensive comparison between nine measurements across 38 data sets from various scientific domains (see [21] ). One of their findings is that the euclidean distance remains an entirely accurate, robust, simple, and efficient way of measuring the similarity between two time series. However, stock markets have some properties which make the current similarity measures unfavorable. For instance, stocks react to a lot of exogenous factors such as news (see, e.g., [2] ); thus, the presence of outliers in them is inevitable.

For instance, let us consider closing price of a stock from Nasdaq INC 3 , from 05.10.2008 to 30.09.2018 (522 weeks). In order to estimate its local trend-cycle, we first build a uniform fuzzy partition such that the length of each basic functions A 2 ; ...; A n1 is equal to a proper time slot. In our case, by setting the length of basic function to four, we obtain the approximation of the trend-cycles for one month. In other terms, the monthly behavior of this stock is our concern here.

The quality of clustering based on the new and current similarities can validate the competency of the suggested method [12, 19] . Therefore, we will below apply clustering of time series and compare the behavior of our similarity with the euclidean one. However, let us emphasize that time series clustering is not the primary goal of this research since our focus is on discovering the most similar pairs of stocks available in the database. As we mentioned before, the euclidean distance is an accurate, robust, simple, and efficient way to measure the similarity between two time series and, surprisingly, can outperform most of the more complex approaches (see [18, 20] ). Therefore we will compare our method with the euclidean distance by means of the quality of hierarchical clustering on a dataset. Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which attempts at building a hierarchy of similar groups in data [8] . In this case, one problem to consider is the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. Overall, none of the methods for determining the optimal numbers of clusters is flawless, and none of the suggested similarities are fully satisfactory. Hierarchical clustering does not reveal an adequate number of clusters and estimation of the proper number of clusters is rather intuitive. Hence, there is a fair amount of subjectivity in determination of separate clusters. Figures 3 and 4 , demonstrate the dendrogram of hierarchical clustering of the 92 stocks based on the suggested and euclidean similarity, respectively. The proper number of clusters for both similarities is equal to six. In these figures, the 92 stocks are represented in the x-axis, and their distances are depicted on the y-axis accordingly. Since the stocks are from various industries, they have different scales, and in the case of the clustering with the euclidean distance, we will eliminate the different scaling by normalizing the data. Nevertheless, this step is not demanded by the suggested method since the scale does not influence it. To measure the quality of clustering, we apply the Davies-Bouldin index, which is usually used in clustering. This measure evaluates intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster differences [3] . Therefore, it can be a proper metric for clustering evaluation. Table 1 demonstrates the Davies-Bouldin index for a different number of clusters based on the both similarities. Since the lower score indicates better quality of clustering, the, results reveal that not only is our method reasonably comparable to the euclidean method, but also it has provided more efficient clustering for these examples. Furthermore, as we mentioned before, stock markets are prone to exogenous factors such as bad or good news (see e.g., [2] ). If a method pairs two stocks as similar, one can expect that after the occurrence of an outlier(s), the method would still evaluate these stocks alike. Hence, we will compare the performance of our method, and the euclidean distance metric for the stocks containing outliers. Recall from the previous section that based on both methods, stocks 52 and 53 are very similar to each other since their distance is minimal. Therefore, first, we will add some random artificial outliers to the stock 52, but we do not alter the stock 53 as shown in Fig. 7 . Subsequently, we apply both methods to re-evaluate the similarity between these stocks. Table 2 demonstrates the results. It is apparent, after including artificial outliers, that the euclidean distance has a dramatic jump (around 1800% increase). At the same time, the purposed method shows a minimal increase in distance (33%), which means that the suggested method is much less sensitive to the presence of outliers. Considering that the suggested method is based on the F-transform, it evaluates the similarity between the stocks concerning their local trend-cycles; therefore, it does not have the drawbacks of raw-data based approaches such as the euclidean distance. The latter methods are sensitive to noisy data [22] . One advantage of the euclidean method is its simplicity; however, the suggested method is also relatively simple since it has only one parameter to set (the length of the basic functions). Moreover, experts are able to adjust the suggested similarity measure, according to their time slot of interest. Table 2 .
