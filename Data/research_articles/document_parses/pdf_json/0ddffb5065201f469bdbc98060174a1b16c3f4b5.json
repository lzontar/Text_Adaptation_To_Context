In 2003, an outbreak of SARS started in China and spread to other countries before J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ending in 2004 [10] . A total of 8098 cases in 37 countries/regions had probable SARS diagnoses globally resulting in 775 deaths (case-fatality rate: 10-12%) with most of these cases of infection and deaths occurring in mainland China and Hong Kong [11] . In contrast, a total of 1621 cases of MERS have been reported resulting in 584 deaths (case-fatality rate: 36%). The initial known case of MERS was in a 60-year-old patient who died from a severe respiratory illness in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2012. MERS still sporadically manifests in several different countries [12] . Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus binds to a host cell's angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. ACE2 is commonly expressed on the epithelial cells of alveoli, trachea, bronchi, and bronchial serous glands of the respiratory tract [13] . The virus enters and replicates in these cells. The new developed virions are then released and infect new target cells. The life cycle and mechanism of pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, from attachment to reproduction is shown in Figure 2 .",

They proposed that 2019-nCoV has most similar codon usage bias with snakes [18] . Snakes often hunt bats in the wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species, bats, to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery [18] . Moreover, there is no reliable evidence that coronaviruses live in hosts other than mammals and birds [19] . Therefore, there is probably a mammal intermediate host for 2019-nCoV [20] . On March 19, 2020, a published article showed that the Pangolin-CoV genome exhibited 91% and 90.6% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. This study provides the first report of a potential closely related kin (Pangolin-CoV) of SARS-CoV-2, which was [21] . Consequently, even with the uncovering of the Pangolin-CoV, additional searching for other probable intermediate hosts should be continued (Figure 3) .",

These studies are supported by the number of infection cases that happened within families and among people who did not visit the local animal market in Wuhan [22] . The virus mainly spreads from one person to another, usually through close contact or through respiratory drops produced when the infected person coughs or sneezes, which is why it is important to keep more than two meters (6 ft 7 in) away from a sick person [2] . However, it is not just sneezing or coughing that is the source of transmission of the coronavirus infection. There are other ways to transmit the virus to include spreading from one person to another through surfaces that have been touched by the infected person, especially after studies have demonstrated that the virus remains alive on surfaces for possibly up to 9 days [23, 24] . People can then develop COVID-19 disease when they come into contact with these objects or surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth. Moreover, studies to date indicate that 2019-nCoV is transmitted primarily through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.",

The high temperature and feeling of general malaise are caused by the response of the immune system to the virus and sending signals to the body to release cytokines. However, the virus disrupts the immune response and the body gets more inflammation than needed [42] . Inside the lungs, oxygen travels to the blood but in the case of severe pneumonia, the alveoli begin to fill with water and may cause shortness of breath. In some cases, this results in coughing with sputum, which is a thick mucus that contains lung cells killed by the 19-nCoV. The problem may not be limited to the lungs, as 19-nCoV attacks other important organs in the body to include the kidneys,, which may lead to organ failure [43] . A recent study found that the virus might affect renal tubular cells and testicular cells due to the high expression of ACE2, which is often found in the membranes of the lungs, kidneys cells and cells in seminiferous ducts of the testis. Consequently, 19-nCoV may directly bind to such ACE2 bearing cells and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients [44] . Nevertheless, incomplete evidence is presented concerning the involvement of reproductive organs in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Researchers have detected new symptoms of infection with the 19-nCoV, related to the digestive system, such as loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting and major disorders of the digestive system. Patients who had digestive problems related to the 19-nCoV tended to worsen compared to patients without symptoms of the digestive system. The 19-nCoV destroys the gastrointestinal bacteria leading to these symptoms in the digestive system [45] .",

The WHO has published several testing procedures for COVID-2019. The most common way of testing is using realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [46] . The test may be done on respiratory samples, which can be obtain by several ways to include nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples. Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days. Blood tests can be used but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value. This technique works in detecting the 19-nCoV by identifying the antibodies in the patient blood. These antibodies are released shortly after infection, and their presence confirms the presence of the virus regardless of symptoms. A study by a Chines team found that computed tomography (CT) scans displayed ground-glass opacities in 56% of the cases but 18% had no radiological results [47] . Bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacities are the most typical CT findings. The use of lung x-rays is only suitable for patients with severe symptoms, which means that this technique is not suitable for diagnosing the disease in its early stages. Therefore, several pharmaceutical companies and research organizations are racing to develop more effective and rapid test kits to detect 19-nCoV among people suspected with infection in few minutes and without the need to transfer samples to central laboratories.",

Tocilizumab, marketed as Actemra, has been used to treat patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis to lower inflammation. An initial clinical trial in China used tocilizumab on 20 acute COVID-19 patients. Nineteen patients (95%) were cured and discharged from hospital within two weeks [67] . The FDA has officially approved a phase 3 trial of Actemra in severe COVID-19 patients. Darunavir is another anti-retroviral HIV-1 protease inhibitor. In vitro study was done in February 2020, by Chinese researchers has showen darunavir significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication and its inhibition efficacy was more than that in the untreated group by 280-fold [68] . An anti-parasitic drug called ivermectin has been shown to be effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in an in-vitro study by researchers at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia [69] .

            "text": "The FDA has approved the using of blood plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 with a high neutralizing antibody titer and they may be a valuable donor source of convalescent plasma (CP) [70] . CP is a classic adaptive immunotherapy, has been applied to the prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for more than one century. This plasma therapy may be more effective if it is given to COVID-19 patients early to eliminate the virus before it causes serious damage in their lungs. This procedure was used during the deadly influenza outbreak in 1918, and also as a treatment for measles in the 1930s. In recent years, plasma therapy has been used for Ebola, SARS and H1N1 victims [71, 72] . Some studies indicate that plasma has had some success in reducing symptoms and deaths in previous epidemics. During the SARS epidemic in 2003, a study of 80 patients in Hong Kong showed that they had a chance to recover within two weeks of symptoms following CP therapy as compared to other patients [72] . As there is a similarity between SARS and COVID-19, CP therapy might be a hopeful treatment option for COVID-19 patients. After studies conducted in China to measure the effectiveness of CP therapy, and their impact on the condition of those treated and recovered from infection with the 2019-nCoV, hospitals in New York City are preparing to use the plasma blood of those recovering from the 2019-nCoV as a potential antidote to the disease [73, 74] . However, there is a small possibility of risk of using CP therapy by transmission of some blood-borne pathogen to include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) [75] .At least 10 proposed drugs/vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are under development. Researchers hope to start the first stage of clinical trials within 4 weeks. These will be small trials that are first conducted on healthy people to ensure the safety of the vaccine. Second stage trials start within approximately 8 months, during which the effectiveness of the vaccine will be tested J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in a large group of people. It is estimated that it may take around 12-18 months before a vaccine becomes available. Healthcare biotechnology company Entos Pharmaceuticals is developing a DNA vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 infections using its Fusogenix naomedicine platform. Fusogenix, a proprietary proteo-lipid vehicle (PLV) for genetic medicines, enables the formulation of effective DNA vaccines that can be administered like the flu vaccine. The vaccine payload will be plasmid DNA encoding multiple antigens from key SARS-CoV-2 proteins to promote maximum protection. AT-100, a recombinant form of human surfactant protein-D (rhSP-D), was developed by Airway Therapeutics as a treatment for COVID-19. It has been shown to be effective in preclinical studies in reducing inflammation and infection in the lungs, while also generating an immune response against various respiratory diseases [76] . Canada's Medicago has successfully produced a Virus-Like Particle (VLP) of the SARS-CoV-2 just 20 days after obtaining the SARS-CoV-2 gene. This is an important step in developing a usable vaccine. VLP-like particles are multiprotein structures that resemble native viruses but do not contain the viral genome and thus, are safe. They can be used to stimulate a body's ability to produce antibodies and stimulate cellular immunity with the aim of responding to the virus without the risk of infection [77] . I-Mab",

However, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are never used to prevent COVID-19 because there are frequent side effects associated with their uses, such as worsening vision, nausea, digestive disorders and more severe cases can lead to heart failure..
