The bulk of attention is given to fraud victimization, with consideration also given to parent abuse, partner violence, and patient abuse. A review of data from the Federal Trade Commission shows that reports of most types of fraud grew significantly in the first three months of 2020 in comparison to the same time period in 2019. Differences between fraud experiences based on age are considered. Older persons lost much more to fraud than younger persons, and far more in 2020 than 2019. In addition, they reported being targeted more often for certain types of cybercrime (i.e., tech support scams). While devastating to everyone, it is concluded that the coronavirus will potentially have a more significant impact on the financial health of older persons than younger persons. It is concluded that minimizing the consequences of all forms of crimes targeting older adults will be best achieved by using a public health approach.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Crime is typically thought of as a young person's game.

Those between 20 and 60, however, reported more frauds. At the same time, attention should be drawn to the fact that half of all complaints in Q1 2020 were filed by those 50 or older.

Increases were also high for those in their fifties (~50%), sixties (~50%), and seventies (~43%). It is important to note that fraud losses increased for other age groups. However, proportionally the amount losses are higher for older persons. Table 2 shows the ten most common types of fraud experienced across age groups in Q1 2019 and 2020. Certain types increased by more than 10% across all age categories. These included imposter businesses, fraudulent text messages, online shopping complaints, counterfeit checks, and romance scams. The fact that these offenses have connections to the virtual world (where most activities occurred during the pandemic) is noteworthy. Other increases in cyber-type complaints varied across age categories. For instance, increases in tech support scams were found among those in their fifties, seventies, and eighties and internet information services complaints increased among those in their twenties, thirties, sixties, and seventies. Finding that older persons fell prey more to tech support scams points to their lack of familiarity with the virtual environment, at least in comparison to younger persons. In addition, the fact that those in their eighties did not report Internet services crimes likely reflects routine activities of the age group.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 640, "end": 647, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Fraud and COVID-19"}, {"text": "Some may question drawing conclusions about annual quarters given that COVID-19 did not truly surface in the U.S. until early to mid-March.

In late January, right around the same time the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus \"a global emergency,\" security consultants highlighted one of the first coronavirus phishing scams. The email, supposedly from a virologist, advised potential targets, \"Go through the attached document on safety measures regarding the spreading of corona virus.

So, comparing the first three months of 2019 and 2020, while including a month where the coronavirus would not have impacted fraud, did include two months (February and March) where some offenders were likely motivated by the pandemic.

At least four of these varieties specifically target older persons: grandparent scams, medical fraud, social security administration frauds, and personal care fraud. Table 3 shows how different FTC officials describe these types of fraud. With each type, motivated offenders play on the vulnerabilities of older individuals to carry out the crimes. With grandparent scams, offenders tell older persons that their children or grandchildren are facing a coronavirus emergency and funds are needed to help their offspring. In medical frauds, offenders play on the fact that older persons are at a higher risk of infection and offer fraudulent treatments. In social security administration frauds, offenders target the older person's financial vulnerabilities. Finally, with personal care frauds, offenders target the older person's mobility vulnerabilities, fraudulently offering to run errands or go places the older person is unable or unwilling to go. Table 4 shows the age patterns with specific coronavirus frauds where victims mentioned the pandemic in filing their report to the Federal Trade Commission through April 23, 2020.

Elder abuse has been defined as \"(a) intentional actions that cause harm or create a serious risk of harm (whether or not harm is intended) to a vulnerable elder by a caregiver or other person who stands in a trust relationship, or (b) failure by a caregiver to satisfy the elder's basic needs or to protect the elder from harm\" (National Research Council 2003) . After interviewing elder advocates and attorneys, one reporter characterized the pandemic as a \"breeding ground\" for elder abuse (Levy 2020) . The risk factors contributing to the breeding ground will be discussed below. For now, attention can be given to three types of elder abuse that potentially increased during the pandemic. First, elder neglect refers to situations when individuals fail to provide the care they have a legal duty to provide to older persons. Offenders could be familial caregivers or paid caregivers, and neglect could be active (intentional) or passive (unintentional). Given the concerns that individuals have about catching the virus from others, and the general lack of concern some have towards older persons, it is easy to imagine situations where individuals avoid contact with older persons either out of fear or outright disregard for those who might need care. As an example, a reporter quoted a 27-year-old who said, \"Coronavirus only kills old people, and they are going to die anyway\" (Neutill 2020) . Such an attitude among caregivers would likely foster neglectful behaviors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 454, "end": 486, "text": "(National Research Council 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 618, "end": 629, "text": "(Levy 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1526, "text": "(Neutill 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Elder Abuse"}, {"text": "Elder physical abuse refers to situations where individuals physically harm older adults.

When conceptualizing partner violence, individuals usually apply the age/maturation hypothesis and assume that the behavior involves young couples. Elder abuse researchers are quick to point out that batterers do not simply stop beating their spouses when they hit a certain birthday (Payne 2011) . Challenges that older victims face were exacerbated during the pandemic. For example, because they often feel out of place in shelters which house more younger women, some older victims are referred to nursing homes for safety.

The notion of trust distinguishes fraud from exploitation (Friedrichs 2009; Payne 2011) . With fraud, the offender does not have access to the victim's funds, but gains their trust to steal from them. With exploitation, trust is already present, with the offender having access to their funds, and the offender violates that trust. From this perspective, then, the financial exploitation of older persons would typically be committed by offenders known to the victim while frauds would be committed by strangers. Given unemployment increases and the likelihood that financial dependency on older parents will increase among some, the social consequences of coronavirus are a recipe for elder financial exploitation.

Some have attributed physical abuse to exhaustion and the stressful working environment (Dai et al. 2017; Payne and Cikovic 1996) . With the pandemic creating internal and external stressors for nursing home workers, stress and exhaustion may increase the likelihood of physical abuse.

Given the widespread amount of research that shows how social isolation increases the likelihood of elder abuse (Pillemer et al. 2016) , it seems safe to conclude that social distancing in the time of a pandemic increases the risk of victimization for older persons.

In other cases, fear of being infected may have kept workers at home. Social distancing measures also prohibited family members from visiting their loved ones. This, too, increased nursing home residents' isolation. The bottom line is that fewer workers and visits from family members means two things in relation to COVID-19: (1) there are fewer capable guardians to protect residents from abuse by other residents or professionals and (2) it's harder for existing staff to meet the needs of residents, so the risk of neglect increases. In fact, nursing homes in New Jersey and California evacuated their residents after too many staff no-shows made it impossible for the homes to remain open (Brown 2020; Zoppo and Everett 2020) .

With unemployment rates soaring during the pandemic, more adults will become dependent on their aging parents. These dynamics will create more motivated offenders (the financially dependent offspring) and vulnerable targets (the aging parents).

That same technology, however, has created new opportunities for victimization and these victimization experiences vary by victim age. Consider, for example, the finding that older persons reported more technology support scams than younger persons. It is possible these scams targeted younger persons equally. Older persons, however, might be more apt to fall for them given their lower level of familiarity with technology.
