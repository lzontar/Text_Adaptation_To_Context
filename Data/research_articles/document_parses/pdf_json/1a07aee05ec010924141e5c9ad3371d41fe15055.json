            "text": "The family Closteroviridae consists of two genera, Closterovirus and Ampelovirus with monopartite genomes transmitted respectively by aphids and mealybugs and the Crinivirus with bipartite genomes transmitted by whiteflies. The Closteroviridae consists of more than 30 virus species, which differ considerably in their phytopathological significance. Some, like beet yellows virus and citrus tristeza virus (CTV) were associated for many decades with their respective hosts, sugar beets and citrus. Others, like the grapevine leafroll-associated ampeloviruses 1, and 3 were also associated with their grapevine hosts for long periods; however, difficulties in virus isolation hampered their molecular characterization. The majority of the recently identified Closteroviridae were probably associated with their vegetative propagated host plants for long periods and only detected through the considerable advances in dsRNA isolation and sequencing of PCR amplified replicons. Molecular characterization of CTV and several other Closteroviridae revealed that, in addition to genomic and subgenomic RNAs, infected plants contain several different subviral defective RNAs (dRNAs). The roles and biological functions of dRNAs associated with Closteroviridae remain terra incognita.",

            "text": "Viruses are among the smallest biological entities and, because of the small size of their genomes, their survival depends on the use of a variety of molecular strategies that allow them to stretch their genome-coding capacities to the limit. For example, the singlestranded DNA Geminiviridae that are \u223c3 kb in length, a length that would generally allow transcription and translation of a less than 100-kDa polypeptide, employ a sophisticated multiframe reading of their plus-genome and negative-genome strands that amplifies their coding capacity several-folds, considerably increasing the number and size of the translation products that can be obtained (Hull, 2002) . Similarly, the coding capacities of many single-stranded RNA viruses are enhanced by the use of readthrough products. An even more common strategy is for a few viral expression products to play multiple roles. For example, the p25 gene of the citrus tristeza closterovirus, family Closteroviridae, (i) encodes the coat protein that encapsidates most (\u223c97%) of the viral particles (Febres et al., 1996) , (ii) acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing (RSS; Lu et al., 2004) , and (iii) is most probably involved in vector adaptation for the natural transmission of this virus from infected to uninfected hosts. Similarly, the p23 protein of CTV serves as (i) an RSS (Lu et al., 2004) , (ii) a regulator of RNA strand synthesis (Satyanarayana et al., 2002) , and (iii) the inducer of CTV symptoms in certain CTV-sensitive host plants (Flores et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Viral genomes are equipped with a complex and versatile toolbox that allows them to survive and spread, despite a number of serious limitations, such as (i) dependence on just a few insect species for natural transmission, (ii) dependence on a sometimes restricted range of host plants or on only certain types of tissues, and (iii) the challenge of a potent generic host defense mechanism, the RNA-silencing system. Despite the sophisticated replication machinery that viruses have developed for their survival, it is difficult to understand how some large, single-stranded, single-component RNA genomes, such as the \u223c30-kb genome of animal-infecting coronaviruses and most of the 15-to 20-kb genomes of Closteroviridae members, manage to survive in the face of incidental degradation and targeted dicing by the active host defense silencing machinery within their host cells and/or as they are carried by phloem-feeding aphid vectors. The biological cost of such a situation, in which every single fracture at each of the c. 20,000 possible fragile targets could lead to RNA disruption and to total genetic and energetic loss, could have been detrimental to the continuous survival of such big genomes. In addition, CTV must also contend with the grave consequences of high error rates of viral RNA replication (Lauring and Andino, 2010) , which for the large CTV genome is expected to result in average of at least two nucleotide changes per each genome/generation. For CTV tolerant Citrus sp. trees, which often survive tens and even up to 100 years, such a mutation rate could had been expected to result in a considerable genetic diversity. Surprisingly, however, analyses of CTV strains from spatially and temporally separated citrus trees revealed a highly conserved genome (Albiach-Mart\u00ed et al., 2000) . Further evidence for the remarkable genetic stability of closterovirus genomes (Dolja and Koonin, 2013) , especially of the CTV, is the CTV-based vectors infecting citrus plants. Some of the CTV-based vectors infected citrus trees continued to express the inserted green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene for up to 7 years (Dawson, 2011) . The genetic stability of CTV holds apparently only when plants are infected by a monotypic closterovirus isolate (Weng et al., 2007) . Genetic analysis of a Floridian CTV isolate from citrus tree infected by three major CTV genotypes revealed numerous variants generated by promiscuous recombination between the major genotypes and additional divergence further increased genotypic complexity of the initial recombinants (Weng et al., 2007; Zhongguo Xiong, personal communication) . These results raise the possibility of an unknown mechanism to limit accumulation of point mutation CTV mutants while preserving those generated through recombination. The presence of multiple defective dRNAs in trees infected with many CTV isolates further supports this possibility (Batuman et al., 2010) .",

Other viruses of this family, particularly among those belonging to the Crinivirus genus, appear to have emerged more recently. Low virus titer and association with deciduous fruit tree and grapevine (Vitis vinifera) woody hosts that are polyphenol rich handicapped purification of many of these viruses and delayed their characterization until finding that Closteroviridae infections are associated with large amounts of dsRNA (Dodds and Bar-Joseph, 1983 ). The considerable progress achieved toward elucidation of the genomic functions of Closteroviridae has been widely reviewed in different journals and book chapters Members of the genus Closterovirus are mainly transmitted by aphids; whereas members of the genus Ampelovirus, which also have monopartite genomes, are mainly transmitted by mealybugs (Martelli et al., 2012) . The Crinivirus, and a recently proposed new genus with monopartite particles named Velarivirus are mostly transmitted by whiteflies. Most of the members of the genus Crinivirus (transmitted by whiteflies) have bipartite genomes, although a virus with a tripartite genome, potato yellow vein virus (PYVV), was assigned to this genus (Livieratos et al., 2004) . Interestingly, the virus-vector relationships of members of the three Closteroviridae genera appear to have had far stronger effects on the diversification of a range of genomic properties than on the adaptation of these viruses to different hosts (Karasev, 2000) .",

Interestingly, T36, the first CTV strain to have its genome characterized, differs in this aspect. Unlike VT, in which almost every subtype contains major dRNAs, dRNAs appear to be less common in the T36 strain.

The question of why these heterologous double-recombinants are so small has been raised. CTV-dRNA homologous-sequence double-recombinants (Class 5 dRNAs) are more than 100 nucleotides in length; whereas the heterologous inserts of Class 6 dRNAs are at least 10-fold shorter. One possible explanation for this could be that a naturally occurring selection process eliminates any CTV-dRNAs with inserts of host genes of 21-25 nt, which might silence the normal expression of the respective host genes. Such a mechanism could also explain the limited amount of non-self recombinants among RNA viruses, in general, and suggest a new function for RNA silencing of RNA viruses, namely reducing the possibility that virus genomes might amplify RNA segments derived from the mRNA of their hosts.",

            "text": "The dRNAs of CTV provide us with some tentative answers to questions about virus evolution. First, the finding that populations of naturally self-replicating dRNAs (Class 3) and Class 4 dRNAs harboring the entire battery of ORFs analogous to the RNA 2 of criniviruses suggests that similar forms of dRNA may have led to the evolution of the bipartite criniviruses from a monopartite velarivirus parent. In addition, dsRNA molecules corresponding to one or more major CTV-dRNAs have been found to account for substantial amounts of the total dsRNA found in CTV-infected plants. Since dsRNA molecules can be considered the dead ends of the viral replication process, their abundance in Closteroviridae (Dodds and Bar-Joseph, 1983 ) naturally raises evolutionary questions. One possibility that we would like to suggest is that, in addition to the three suppressor genes, CTV and other Closteroviridae with large, very fragile genomes use the abundant dsRNA in their genomic, subgenomic, and dRNA as a buffering system, to protect their large RNA genomes against the risk of being targeted by the active host defense RNA silencing.",

After two decades of continuous transmission of the VT isolate in Mexican lime and Alemow seedlings, the symptoms observed on the Alemow plants remained unchanged. However, among the SO (sour orange) plants that used to test for SY (seedling yellows), we noticed that some failed to exhibit the typical SY symptoms. The examination of the dRNAs of Alemow plants infected with CTV-VT subisolates that exhibited SY and non-SY reactions revealed the presence of one major dRNA population. The main difference between both subisolate groups was the association of 4.5-and 2.4-kb dRNAs with non-SY-and SY-reacting VT isolates, respectively. Furthermore, VT isolate #12, which contains a large dRNA with a complete 5 moiety of the gRNA, did not induce the stem-pitting symptoms typically observed in infected Alemow plants. However, the possibility of differences between SY and non-SY, or stem pitting(SP) and non-SP, isolates in other genomic regions was not ruled out and the considerable progress that has been made recently in the field of sequencing techniques is expected to clarify this issue. In conclusion, the roles and biological functions of the numerous dRNAs associated with Closteroviridae remain terra incognita.",
