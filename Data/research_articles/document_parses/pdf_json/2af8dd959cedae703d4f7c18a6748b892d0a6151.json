The current population of Turkey is 84 339 067, 4 and Turkey welcomed more than 31 million foreign visitors during the first 8 months of 2019. Turkey ranks sixth in the world in terms of number of tourists and 14th in terms of tourism income. 5 Turkey is surrounded by eight countries, namely, Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Azerbaijan, and cases of COVID-19 have been reported in most of these countries. 2 In light of the coronavirus outbreak, Turkey announced to cease all flights from China 6 and closed its border with Iran and Iraq. 7 The ministry also established field hospitals near the Iraq and Iran borders. However, despite these precautionary measures, by March 19, Turkey had more than 190 confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths. 2, 8 According to the Interim guidelines of the WHO on responding to the community spread of COVID-19, a comprehensive package of precautionary measures is required for countries to prepare when there are no cases, sporadic cases, clusters of cases, community transmission, or country-wide transmission. 8 There is still much to learn about this infectious disease and its negative impact in different contexts, and preparedness and response actions will continue to be driven by rapidly accumulating scientific and public health knowledge. The WHO developed a strategic preparedness and response plan for COVID-19 which aims to slow and stop transmission, prevent outbreaks and delay spread, provide optimized care for all patients (especially the serious ill cases), and minimize the potential impact of the epidemic on health systems, social services, and economic activity. 3 The priorities and intensity of efforts to tackle this issue will depend on the scenario each specific country or a sub-national area currently faces. The COVID-19 epidemic is a problematic and complicated situation that requires concerted efforts at both national and international levels to tackle. Therefore, and given the reporting of ",
