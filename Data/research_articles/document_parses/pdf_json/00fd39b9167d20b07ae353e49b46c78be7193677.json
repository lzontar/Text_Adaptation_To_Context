            "text": "The question that should be asked is how these conflicting results might be explained. The existence of different phenotypes of T cells in the two study populations of elderly people can be excluded, because in the Wolters paper, and even more so in our paper, the number of participants was high enough. An incorrectly chosen injection site was denied by Wolters et al. With respect to different vaccine lots, it was stated by Wolters et al. that they found no relationship between particular batches and lack of immune response. No batch was outdated. There appeared to be no reason to assume failure in the production of the vaccine used.Interruptions of the cold chain were not mentioned, and whether, during the relatively long storage of serum samples, electricity blackouts took place was not reported.Low levels of HbsAg carriage were excluded by the authors. With respect to health problems in elderly people, it was reported by Wolters et al. that a considerable proportion of the elderly probands had some kind of chronic disease which significantly influenced the rate of protection against hepatitis B, but not against hepatitis A. In our study, elderly people were included as they appeared in clinical praxis, without registering mild health aberrations. It may be that there were some differences in the quality of the population between the study of Wolters et al. and our study. Also, however, the interval between the booster and the drawing of blood samples was different in the two studies. As shown in the table, the investigated blood samples were obtained in our study within 6 months after the booster, whereas in the study of Wolters et al., the mean time interval between completion of vaccination and measurement of antibody titer was 16.8 months. Since the fast phase of antibody decline lasted for approximately 1.5 years in our study, this might have an enormous quantitative impact. It was also mentioned in the paper of Wolters et al. that people without anti-HBs antibodies had a longer time interval between vaccination and examination of their serostatus than those with protective titers. In the case of vaccination failures, boosters were very effective.",

We deny the relevance of these data, because, following the consensus statement of the European Consensus Group on hepatitis B immunity, there is no need for booster vaccination after a successful primary vaccination series in healthy individuals, as the maintenance of HBsAg specific memory confers protection against clinical breakthrough infections even in the absence of detectable antibodies. 9 An effective priming apparently took place in the population of Wolters et al., since boosters were very effective. Moreover, in our hands, a follow-up of antibody titers for many years showed that the slow phase of antibody decline still took place in the protective range.",
