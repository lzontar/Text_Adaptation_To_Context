Dear Editor-Although elderly individuals are more susceptible to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) than younger people, approximately half of patients requiring intensive care are adults less than 65 years of age (1). There is a growing concern about men, who have a higher risk of developing illness and death (2) .",

Male gynecomastia caused by an estrogen-testosterone imbalance may be due to obesity, endocrine abnormalities, hepatic failure, alcohol abuse, adverse medication effects, and renal failure (3). The majority of our patients did not have comorbidities. Thus, other associated factors such as lifestyle or anabolic dietary supplements should be considered (4) . Recently, a high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has also been found in adipocytes (5) .",
