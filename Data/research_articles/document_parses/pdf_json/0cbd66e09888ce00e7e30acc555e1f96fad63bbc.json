The possibility that the 28-kD protein may confer water permeability was tested by expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes which normally have low water permeability. When transferred to relatively low-concentration buffer, the oocytes microinjected with in vitro-transcribed AQPl RNA were found to have markedly increased water permeability, causing them to swell and burst. The process was reversibly inhibited by Hg 2 + [5] . In addition, the purified AQPl was reconstituted into proteoliposome which exhibited up to 50-fold above that of control liposomes. The unit water permeability was found to be extremely high, about 3 X 10 9 water molecules per subunit per second, while transport of urea and protons was not increased and negligible [6] . More direct evidences came from von Hoek. The water permeability in the red cell membrane depleted of non-aquaporin protein was similar to that of the original membrane [7] . Thus, the debates on the existence of water channels should be over. The recent viewpoint on water transport through cell membranes was that the lipid bilayer and water channel both contributed to the water permeability and the latter was related to regulated and efficient water transport.",

How can aquaporins rapidly transport water but not proton?

            "text": "Each monomer of aquaporins provides an hourglass-like pore with 20 A in length, which is mainly surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids, yet there are still four hydrophilic sites for water binding and lowering the energy barrier. These two opposing facts balance with each other to transport water selectivity while optimizing permeability[15 1 . The narrowest segment of the channel occurs about S A above the channel center where the entry 648 of molecules is controlled by size restriction and electrostatic repulsion. At this level, the wall of the pore is mainly formed by the side chains of arginine (Arg-195) and histidine (His-ISO), which provide a pore with diameter of 2.S A, the same size of van der Waals diameter of water, to filter the molecular size larger than water, while the positive charge of arginine and histidine at neutral pH would repel cations and tightly bind with anions to prevent from passing through the channel. The most remarkable character of aquaporins is the two-signature NPA motifs, which are juxtaposed by Van der Waals force and associated with each other at the center of the pore. The dipoles caused by two short a-helices whose N-termini are facing the pore result in partial positive charges surrounding the nearby conserved asparagines. An isolated water molecule is now believed to transiently form partial hydrogen bonds with both asparagines, thus undergoing a temporary dipole reorientation of the water molecule-the oxygen faces down when the water molecule enters from the extracellular side, and then flips, moves further down the channel with the oxygen facing upward. This results in the broken of the column of the hydrogen bonds, thus prevents proton transport through the membrane (Fig. 2 ).",

About fifty years ago, Hodgkin and Huxley (Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine for 1963) had clarified the mechanism of action potential, which attributed to the sequential rise of permeability to sodium and potassium ions in nerve cell membrane. It in fact hints the exis- tence of selective ion channels. In the 1980s, cloning of the pore-forming a subunits of voltage-gated Na+, K+ and Ca 2 + channels was reported[l8]. The sequences of Na+ and Ca 2 + channels indicate four homologous repeats, each with six putative transmembrane segments (S 1-S6), while the subsequently cloned K+ channels are only about onefourth as large as Na+ channels and contain one copy of the S 1-S6 motif. Thus, K+ channels may be implied to be homotetramer, which was then proved by MacKinnon[l9] by stoichiometry.",

Each subunit has two transmembrane a-helices connected by short pore region that consists of pore helices, selectivity filter, etc. A subunit is inserted into tetramer such that one transmembrane helix (inner helix) faces the central pore while the other faces the lipid membrane. The inner helices are tilted with respect to the membrane normal by about 25\u00b0 and are slightly kinked. The four subunits of K+ channels enclosed a pore for K+ transport, whose narrow outer part consists of a 12 A selectivity filter formed by conserved signature sequence, while the inner part is quite wide and contains a central cavity with a diameter of loA at the center. Near the intracellular aspect of membrane, the four inner helices are packed against each other as a bundle. Besides the structure of KcsA, MacKinnon further determined Ca 2 +-gated potassium channels, voltage-gated potassium channels, etc., and combined with a series of functional experiments, he clarified the fundamental mechanisms of many ion channels (Table 1) .",

K+ selectivity occurs in the selectivity filter, which is formed by signature sequence amino acids as threonine-valine-gl ycine-tyrosine-glycine. These amino acids provide carbonyl oxygen atom, and form four cages along the pore, each offering a binding site for K+ ions (Fig. 3(b ) ). At these sites K+ ions bind in an essentially dehydrated state, surrounded by eight oxygen atoms from the protein, four above and four below each ion, which is the same case as the K+ ions in the water surrounded by eight oxygen atoms came from water molecules. The binding sites mimic the hydrated K+ in the water, thus the energy cost of K+ diffusing from water into selectivity filter could be largely compensated. The dehydrated atom radius of Na+ (0.95 A) is smaller than K+ (1.33 A), failing to be fit for the selectivity filter, thus the energy barrier is rather high.",

Besides the structural study, a comparison with the distribution of other ions (e.g. Rb +) in the filter [35] showed (Fig. 4) . Since glycine is unique in its ability to adopt a wide range of main-chain dihedral angles and confer flexibility, it is adapted to be gating hinge. Along with the elucidation of mechanisms for selectivity and gating, the most difficult and important problem for K+ channels, the mechanism for voltage sensing, is in special need to understand. After a six-year effort, MacKinnon published the first structure of six-transmembrane voltage-gated K+ channel in 2003 [33] . Although the structure (KvAP) from Aeropyrum pernix may be in a non-native state, it still provides a simple possibility for us to understand how the voltage sensors might transfer the gating charges through the membrane electric field.",

The second helix in S3 (S3b) and the N-terminal half of the defined S4 are packed tightly against each other, forming a helix-turnhelix structure that is mainly hydrophobic, with the notable exception of distributed arginine residues. We call Chinese Science Bulletin Vol. 49 No.7 April 2004 this S3b-S4 unit the voltage-sensor paddle. It is shown that the first four arginine residues in S4 account for most of the gating charges movement that open and close the pore by pulling S4-S5 linker (Fig 4) . Through the method of molecular ruler, MacKinnon got to know that the total displacement of the voltage-sensor paddles is approximately 20 A perpendicular to the membrane [36] .",

The most important work on water channels was over in 1988 and the later work on highresolution structure of water channels was not only attributed to Agre. Since he is the first one to discover and isolate water channels, this contribution has made the out-pouring of research on aquaporins world-wide and him the Nobel laureate. In contrast to water channels, the difficulty in the investigation of K+ channels is quite different--its existence has been inferred early, but in lack of atom-resolution structure. Under this background MacKinnon turned to structural biology to study K+ channels and since 1998, he determined a series of the atomic structure on ion channels, succeeding in setting up the model of K+ channels (Cl-channels also). He is worthy of Nobel Prize.",
