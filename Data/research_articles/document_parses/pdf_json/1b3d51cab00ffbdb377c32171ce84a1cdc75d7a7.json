However, the high proportion among low-risk age group raises the question on the necessity of medical grade facemask use in community setting. Besides that, we also observed that individuals using medical grade facemask had 6.4 times more likely to practice unacceptable facemask use.

Feng S et al and team compiled contradictory view by difference agencies ; generally the western countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and Germany have stand use of facemask by healthy general population while Asian countries such as China , South Korea and Japan have adopted a risk-based approach by distributing facemask to the general public[38] . The different approach in facemask by Asian countries are the response adaptive and preventive behaviour due to previous exposure of regional SARS epidemic[39] . During the SARS epidemic, preventive measures such as face mask use were commonly practiced[40] and have been norm of the public even after the epidemic subsided [41]. It's evident that the approach to facemask usage among general population depends on the recommendation of local health authorities as well as the availability of the commercial product in the market. In Malaysia , there was reports of facemask shortage during the initial outbreak[42]; however , the widespread use and availability of the facemask observed in this study could be due to importation on 10 million facemask from china during the acute shortage phase[43] , increase in manufacturing and establishment of new manufacturing facility to increase in production capacity of local manufacturer [44, 45] and handling out 24.6 million facemask to Malaysian household[46].Despite the high prevalence of facemask usage among our population, we found that high-risk age group have unacceptable facemask practice. The unacceptable facemask practice among high-risk age group raises concern as subjects \u2265 60 years old are 18 times (OR: 18.82 , 95% CI 7.20-41.55) more likely to die from COVID-19 [47] and multiple other studies have established mortality risk for this group [8, 48, 49]. Although the use of facemask should be encouraged, the use of medical grade facemask by general population is questionable. Acute shortage of facemask have been reported when local epidemics begin [50-52]. When China announced Hubei provenance lockdown , the daily demand of facemask estimated to be >50 million pieces daily whereas the daily production have dropped from 20 million to 15 million[53] promoting China to temporarily export of facemask. These have resulted in worldwide shortage of medical facemasks [50-52, 54]. This sudden uptake in the use of medical-grade facemasks by the general public worsens the global shortage of facemasks, further depletes facemask availability to both health-care workers and susceptible individuals[55, 56]", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Demographic characteristic , facemask type and usage among general population during visit", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>to wet market Description </td><td>Frequency (n=1697) </td><td>Percentage (%) </td></tr><tr><td>Gender </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Male </td><td>1024 </td><td>60.3 </td></tr><tr><td>Female </td><td>673 </td><td>39.7 </td></tr><tr><td>Ethnic </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Malay </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Malay </td><td>1168 </td><td>68.8 </td></tr><tr><td>Non-Malay </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Chinese </td><td>125 </td><td>7.4 </td></tr><tr><td> Indian </td><td>382 </td><td>22.5 </td></tr><tr><td> Unidentifiable </td><td>22 </td><td>1.3 </td></tr><tr><td>Age Group Low-risk Age group </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Children </td><td>5 </td><td>0.3 </td></tr><tr><td> Adult </td><td>1546 </td><td>91.1 </td></tr><tr><td>High-risk Age group </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Elderly </td><td>146 </td><td>8.6 </td></tr><tr><td>Facemask Use </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>1687 </td><td>99.7 </td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>10 </td><td>0.6 </td></tr><tr><td>Category of Facemask </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Did not wear face mask </td><td>10 </td><td>0.6 </td></tr><tr><td>Medical Grade </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Surgical facemask </td><td>1299 </td><td>76.5 </td></tr><tr><td> Respirator </td><td>39 </td><td>2.3 </td></tr><tr><td>Non-Medical Grade </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Cloth mask </td><td>258 </td><td>15.2 </td></tr><tr><td> Paper mask </td><td>91 </td><td>5.4 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Demographic characteristic between low-risk and high-risk age group (n=1697)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "within 1687 individual who worn facemask, 1615 (95.7%) individuals' facemask practice was acceptable while the reaming 72 (4.3%) subject was observed with unacceptable facemask practice.
