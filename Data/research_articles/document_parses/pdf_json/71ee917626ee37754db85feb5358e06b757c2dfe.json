The number of males infected with 2019-nCoV is higher than the number of females. This trend was observed even at the time of the SARS-CoV outbreak. A reason behind this trend can be that X chromosome and sex hormones positively regulate innate and adaptive immunity enhancing anti-viral immunity in females (Channappanavar et al. 2017) . Moreover, the 2019-nCoV like the previous SARS and MERS CoV infections elicits strong cytokine responses in the host causing increased pulmonary inflammation and lung damage. Elevated levels of IgA and IgM in the lungs of an infected patient had been detected. The viral infection leads to the production of IL1B, IFN\u03b3, IP10 and MCP1 which further lead to T-Helper 1 cell production (pro-inflammatory). However, a striking observation is that unlike the previous SARS CoV the 2019-nCoV elicited the production of T-Helper 2 cell-related cytokines like IL-10 and IL-4 as well (which are associated with anti-inflammatory signature). This can be one of the reasons for relatively less severe symptoms in many patients.",

It is speculated that this patient must have been infected either through an unknown source or through droplet transmission. Moreover, spread of infection in family clusters from these patients establishes the possibility of human to human transmission of infection (Chan et al. 2020b) . All the early patients diagnosed with novel coronavirus infection outside China like in Japan, Thailand or India had visited Wuhan just days before the outbreak . Given the cases where health workers or other patients and visitors to hospitals across Wuhan have contracted the infection, airborne droplets due to coughing, touching and using personal hygiene items (like towels and cosmetics) of the infected and nosocomial transmission seem the most probable modes of further spread of infection. However, further investigations are required to understand the exact mode of transmission of this virus among humans.",

The cycle threshold or ct values of the patient-derived samples ranged from 22.85 to 32.41.

The single-stranded RNA of the 2019-nCoV consists of 29,881 nucleotides coding for 9860 amino acids. The either ends of the RNA genome are flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) which is similar to that of other Betacoronavirus. Starting from the 5\u2032 end, the genome consists of ORF1 a/b that codes for 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) including RdRp followed by other ORFs coding for Coronaviruses produce a set of nested sub-genomic (SG) mRNAs of varying sizes which are then translated to produce various structural and accessory proteins (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al. 2011). These SG mRNAs are synthesized by a 'discontinuous template synthesis' method in which a 5\u2032 leader sequence is joined to an ORF(s) via the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). TRS is a conserved 5-7 nucleotide sequences upstream of ORFs in coronavirus genomes. Bioinformatics studies have revealed that in 2019-nCoV around 12 ORFs produce a set of 9 nested SG mRNAs. Inside a host cell when the virus makes its copies, the orf1a/b is directly translated to produce two polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab which are cleaved to form 16 nsp including RdRp. These nsp together form a replication transcription complex (RTC). RTC then replicates the virus genome and produces various structural and accessory protein SG mRNAs inside a double membrane vesicle.",

The S1 domain is responsible for receptor binding, whereas the S2 domain is responsible for fusion of virus with the host cell membrane. The SARS-CoV forms a clover-shaped trimer with three S1 heads and a trimeric S2 stalk (Cui et al. 2019) . The S1 domain is further sub-divided into an amino terminal domain (S1-NTD) and a cysteine-rich carboxy terminal domain (S1-CTD). The S1-CTD at the tip of S1 domain acts as the RDB. The RBD is further sub-divided into a core region and a receptor binding motif (RBM). The compatibility of spike protein with the host cell receptor is largely dependent on the amino acid residues in the RBM. Any changes in the RBM or even core region amino acid residues can decrease or increase the affinity of spike -receptor binding. Changes in amino acid residues in RBM can even alter the virus' tropism (Song et al. 2005) .",

The residues at each of these positions form a salt bridge with specific ACE-2 receptor residues. Asparagine or arginine at residue 479 of RBM increases binding affinity with human and civet (intermediate host of SARS-CoV) ACE-2, whereas lysine at the same position decreases this binding affinity. Serine at residue 487 is required for RBM binding with civet ACE-2, but it fails to bind efficiently with human ACE-2. On the other hand, mutations in SARS-CoV leading to threonine at residue 487 lead to very efficient RBM and human ACE-2 binding. The early phase SARS-CoV strain-hcGd03 (Ser at residue487) that infected humans from civets had low infectivity and failed to transmit between humans. However, Fig. 2 A simplified phylogenetic analysis of spike protein of 2019-nCoV with different reference genomes from the genus Betacoronavirus middle-and late-phase SARS-CoV strains especially hTor02 had a high infectivity and rapidly transmitted between humans as it had Thr at residue 487.

In fact, the S2 domain of 2019-nCoV has a high degree of similarity with its two bat-derived ancestors-SL-CoVZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21, but interestingly, on the other hand, the S1 domain shares very little similarity. Rather the S1 domain of 2019-nCoV is very similar to that of SARS-CoV with around 50 conserved amino acid residues despite the fact the two falls in different clades. Consistent with this, the homology modeling of RBD of 2019-nCoV with SARS-CoV RBD as template revealed that the RBM of the 2019-nCoV is very similar in structure to that of SARS-CoV. These results led to the conclusion that 2019-nCoV may also bind to the human ACE-2 receptor. Another study using HeLa cells expressing ACE-2 also reached the same conclusion that 2019-nCoV may bind with the ACE-2 receptors (Zhou et al. 2020 ). However, many residues that are crucial for binding of SARS-CoV RBD with ACE-2 vary in 2019-nCoV. The significance of these variations on ACE-2 binding needs to be further investigated.",

The two species of snakes mentioned above had the least squared Euclidean distance value compared to other animals. The RSCU results were further supported by claims that the two species of snakes are found in the central Hubei province and were even being sold at Huanan sea food market.

Experimental analysis of protein coded by ORF3b region of SARS-CoV shows that the protein is required for increased replication rate of the virus inside host cells leading to cell necrosis (Yount et al. 2005; Khan et al. 2006) .

A reason for this is the inability of bats' innate immunity to sense viral DNAs in the cytosol. Bats have a very high rate of metabolism and increased rates of oxidative phosphorylation cause self-DNA damage leading to its escape from the nucleus and mitochondria into the cytosol. Bats have with time evolved to ignore this self-DNA in the cytosol by dampening of STING mechanism of DNA sensing and downregulating the production of appropriate IFN response. This in turn leads to even viral DNA in bat cytosol to go undetected leading them to host a wide range of viruses (Xie et al. 2018) .",

We still fell short of the requisite preparedness to combat the current outbreak. We need to learn many lessons from this current novel coronavirus outbreak and other epidemics in the past from different geographical regions under the 'One Human-Animal-Environment' approach. If an effective treatment to eradicate novel coronavirus infections is not found quickly the pandemic may turn into a recurring endemic in certain regions which will be even harder to tackle. Biomedical engineers, scientists, chemists and doctors need to come together to find innovative solution. A lot is known about coronaviruses, but still a lot needs to be known about their evolution, transmission and functions of different regions of their genome. Research focusing on development of broad range drugs and vaccines against coronaviruses based on conserved protein structures needs attention to stay ready for similar outbreaks in future. Newer technologies like artificial intelligence for prediction of disease epidemiology and development of more sensitive and affordable biosensors must also be given attention in this context.",
