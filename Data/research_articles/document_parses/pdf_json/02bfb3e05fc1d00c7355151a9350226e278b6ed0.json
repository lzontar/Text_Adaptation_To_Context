This paper analyses the design and beneficiaries of these policies and, given the distributional pattern of the labour market shock, considers the emerging overall impact on living standards, particularly of low-income households.",

            "text": "The UK is in the midst of the biggest shock to economic activity that it has experienced for hundreds of years, one that is rooted in the labour market, driven by the shutting down of certain sectors of the economy and the effects of social distancing rules. At the time of writing, the Bank of England is expecting the economy to shrink by 25 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 (and by 14 per cent for the year as a whole). The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expecting a 35 per cent GDP fall in the second quarter. This paper assesses how the crisis is affecting, or is likely to affect, household incomes, and particularly low-income households. In section 2, we assess the three core components of the UK government's strategy to directly protect household incomes: the social security system (including the changes announced once the crisis began), and the new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (we limit our attention to policies announced by the UK government and do not discuss the (very minor) additional policies announced by the devolved administrations). Using microsimulation methods, we show how well these changes protect households from the financial implications of unemployment. In section 3, we discuss the emerging evidence on the impact of the crisis on the distribution of living standards. Although there is not yet a consensus, it seems that the fall in household incomes is more evenly spread across the income distribution than the loss of jobs is distributed across the earnings distribution, and may even be greater among those on higher (pre-crisis) incomes. But we also show that other indicators of financial well-being or living standards than income paint a more worrying story about the ways that the crisis is affecting low-income households. 2 We conclude in section 4.",

This change aligns the main adult rate of benefits for an unemployed single adult to the level of Statutory Sick Pay, and means it is at its highest ever level in real terms, and at its highest level relative to average earnings since 1998/99 (see Figure 1 ). It is noteworthy that the size of the COVID-19 rise in UC was the same for all family types, with no additional help offered to families with children. 4 In addition, Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rates (which determine caps on housing support in UC and Housing Benefit for privatesector tenants) were increased, particularly favouring areas in which rents have grown rapidly since 2012 (Judge and Pacitti, 2020) . We discuss more who gains from this reform in the next section, but we note now that the detailed rules about UC entitlement mean that the UC increase will not be felt in full by recipients who are affected by the benefit cap (although some of the newly unemployed will benefit from a 9-month grace period), and the LHA increases do not benefit renters in those parts of London that are affected by a national cap on LHA rates. These measures followed some technical changes in the March 2020 Budget that help the selfemployed, including the suspension of the minimum income floor in UC (which in effect increases the amount that very low-income self-employed workers can claim), and the removal of the 7-day waiting period that restricted access to contributory ESA (which self-employed people can claim when sick or self-isolating). Local authorities were also given extra funds to provide help with Council Tax bills and to enhance local welfare provision. At the time of announcing the measures, the government said that the boost to social security benefits and tax 3 We do not attempt to give a thorough guide to the social security system in the UK. It will help to know that the two most important benefits for those who are made unemployed are 'contributory' or 'new style' Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), and Universal Credit. 'New style' JSA is available to former employees who have made sufficient National Insurance contributions, and is payable without a means test (i.e. regardless of how much an individual has in savings or whether they are living with a partner with their own earnings). It is paid at a low flat rate that does not try to reflect any additional needs that a person might have, including the presence of a partner or children. Those formerly self-employed are not able to claim. Universal Credit, like all means-tested benefits in the UK, does not require someone to have made sufficient National Insurance contributions, and entitlement is usually higher for families with children or health or disability needs, for example, than those without. But awards are means tested against the total income of the family and any savings. Different benefits are available to those who cannot work through ill-health or disability, and we do not discuss those further. 4 A scheme was introduced to give vouchers or food parcels to families whose children would have received free school meals had they been attending school, but this is simply maintaining the pre-pandemic levels of support, rather than providing additional help to those with children.",

(2020) have similar analysis). It shows a great deal of variation in the extent to which the social security system protects people from the financial consequences of unemployment. This reflects at least three factors. First, people's entitlement to benefits if they do not work will depend on their family circumstances, meaning that two people on similar levels of earning may face different replacement rates (this can be seen in the low replacement rates for single adults without children who have low entitlements to benefits compared to those with children, especially for those under 25). Second, benefits paid in the event of unemployment in the UK are paid at a (low) flat rate, irrespective of previous earnings, and so those on higher earnings tend to face lower replacement rates. Third, asset tests in the calculation of UC mean that families with more than \u00a316,000 of savings will miss out on this support entirely (as shown in, for example, Figure 19 in Brewer and Handscomb (2020)). Such tests have their justifications, but pose challenges to the social security system's ability to function as a safety net during such a large and rapid economic shock. 5 Figure 2 shows that the impact of the coronavirus reforms was to increase the median replacement rate across all workers from 50 to 53 per cent. However, the fact that the increase to UC was a flat-rate \u00a320 per week for all family types means that the maximum UC entitlement for a couple aged 25 or over with two children rose by just 11 per cent (and median replacement rates for workers in these families improved by just 3 ppts), whereas the rate for a single adult under 25 rose by 36 per cent on its 2019 value (and the median replacement rate for this group improved by 8 ppts). 5 International comparisons of replacement rates are difficult and can depend on family circumstances and the duration of unemployment, but Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) comparisons do show that the UK ranks towards the bottom of international league tables in terms of the amount of income protection provided by benefits in the event of unemployment: see https://data.oecd.org/benwage/benefits-inunemployment-share-of-previous-income.htm#indicator-chart, accessed 22 May 2020, for example, which looks at replacement rates for single adults without children paid at 67 per cent of the national average. Notes: Replacement rates shown for benefit unit income before housing costs, for adults aged 16-64 who stop working and then claim benefits as entitled. Partner income held constant.

In a world where all employees are placed on the JRS and all self-employed workers receive the SEISS, then the median replacement rate is 91 per cent (it is greater than 80 per cent partly because many people will pay lower effective tax rates after a 20 per cent fall in earnings, partly because some people on the JRS can also claim means-tested support through UC, and partly because of the earnings of working partners for those in couples), compared to 53 per cent without it). This highlights a very important issue of fairness: that those former employees who are not currently benefiting from the JRS-perhaps because they were made redundant, or were ineligible because they had only just started a new job as the crisis hit, or because their employer went bust-will be typically experiencing a far greater hit to their incomes than those (relatively) lucky enough to be furloughed. It also suggests that, as the JRS scheme is reformed during the second half of 2020, any currently furloughed workers who are made redundant may experience large falls in their family income.",

In the UK recessions of the mid-1970s, the early 1980s, and the early 1990s, the number of individuals in relative poverty-defined as living in a household with less than 60 per cent of median income-fell, driven by large reductions in pensioner poverty (Muriel and Sibieta, 2009 ). This happened because pensioners get most of their income from sources other than the labour market, and so they tend to move up the income distribution when unemployment rises and earnings from the labour market fall, reducing the number below a floating poverty line. Indicators of poverty that use an anchored poverty threshold increased in all three of these recessions; this is what most people would predict:",

Timelier data give a better sense of the scale of the impact of restrictions on economic activity from late March on the jobs market, though, with a fall of 612,000 in employee jobs captured by PAYE systems between March and May, an 1.6 million increase (up to 2.8 million) in the claimant count measure of unemployment-related benefit recipients, and a more-than-halving of vacancy numbers (by early May). These numbers, although representing extremely large changes in just 2 months, are without doubt much lower than they would have been had the JRS not been in existence, which has supported 9 million jobs at some point in that same time period. More granular week-by-week data from the Labour Force Survey suggest a more acute contraction in hours worked (which will reflect that those people furloughed should not actually be working) than in employee numbers, with average hours worked falling by around a fifth between the last week of April 2020 and the same week (2020) and Gustafsson (2020) suggest that employment impacts have been concentrated among the youngest and oldest workers.

Similarly, Benzeval et al.

The fact that support via the JRS is based on a percentage of prior earnings up to a high cap will mean that higher earners who have been furloughed benefit most in absolute terms, but less as a fraction of previous earnings. Survey data suggest that being furloughed is more common among low earners than high earners ( Figure 1 of Gardiner and Slaughter (2020) ), but that, among all (working-age) adults, furloughing has been most common in the middle of the (pre-crisis) household income distribution (see Figure 3 of Brewer and Gardiner (2020) ); this is because low earners are not found only in low-income households. Brewer and Tasseva (2020, Figure 1 ) estimate the impact of the JRS on household incomes, assuming that the counterfactual is that the worker would have no earnings at all, and find that the impact of the JRS is slightly greater, as a percentage of disposable income, in (pre-crisis) income decile groups 6-9 than it is in 2-5, but that its impact tails off in the top decile group because of the \u00a32,500 per month cap, and is much smaller in the lowest-income decile group because fewer adults were in work pre-crisis (Bronka et al. (2020, Figure 3 ) have similar conclusions). This suggests that the distributional impact of the JRS, when considered across all individuals, is currently neutral or slightly regressive (as in, pro-rich).",

Self-employment is most common at the very bottom and very top of the household income distribution, but the restrictions to SEISS access will be likely to affect both of these groups, with those on lower incomes less likely to have filed tax returns, and some of those on higher incomes missing out due to high profits or incorporation, so it is possible that the greatest impact of this scheme will be felt in the middle of the income distribution.",

Here, it seems likely that the fall in spending reflects more an inability to spend money, given that much of the hospitality, non-food retail, and leisure sectors had been shut down from late March to May 2020. If so, then, for many families, especially the better off, falls in spending probably reflect 'enforced saving' (Corry (2020) shows that better-off families devoted more of their spending to the sectors that were shut down). This is matched by subjective data: Brewer and Gardiner (2020) report that adults in the (pre-coronavirus, working-age) top quintile were as likely to say that their personal financial situation has improved as worsened (23 per cent compared to 22 per cent), whereas in the bottom quintile the figures are 10 per cent vs 36 per cent.

On the other hand, looking at wider measures of living standards reveals a more concerning picture, with those in (precrisis) lower-income families being far more likely to have taken on new debt, or borrowed from friends or family, or cut back on saving; this reflects not that the income falls have been greater than among higher-income households but that they have been less likely to have experienced a (probably enforced) reduction in spending. This, in addition to evidence on people's assessments of their own situation, suggests that the crisis is having more marked negative effects on the living standards-considered broadly-of lower-income working-age families than of higher-income families.

Both they and Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) (who draw on a separate online survey fielded in April 2020) show that these outcomes have been more common for those with atypical work arrangements (particularly temporary workers in the case of job loss; and non-salaried, zero-hours contract, and variable hours workers in the case of furloughing).These findings are broadly replicated inBenzeval et al. (2020), who find large and significant reductions in average working hours for women, likely to be reflecting at least in part the disproportionate additional childcare and home schooling hours working mothers have taken on in the face of school and nursery closures(Andrew et al., 2020).

            "text": "At the time of writing, there were only three studies that suggested how the crisis might be affecting the distribution of income.Brewer and Gardiner (2020) report results from a survey that asked working-age adults about changes in household income between February and May 2020. They show that the experience of a fall in income is distributed surprisingly evenly across the (pre-coronavirus) income distribution: 37 per cent of adults in the bottom 40 per cent of working-age family-level incomes reported income falls, as did 35 per cent of adults in the top 40 per cent. Indeed, experience of increases in income was actually most common among adults at the bottom of the pre-coronavirus income distribution; this could be due to the increases in benefit entitlement.This study did not quantify the scale of the income changes. But two studies have used nowcasting techniques to simulate the distributional impact of the crisis by estimating the distribution of household incomes and comparing that to a counterfactual world where the crisis did not happen. These are:Brewer and Tasseva (2020), who use the data on job loss and falls in earnings analysed inBenzeval et al. (2020) to estimate how the crisis has affected household incomes in April 2020, andBronka et al. (2020), who use data collected from an expert survey of 2,644 economists to estimate how the crisis has affected incomes in the full financial year 2020/21.Both studies estimate, on average, that the crisis reduces household incomes, and the falls in income are greater in proportional terms for households who would have been at the top of the income distribution. However, the estimated impacts vary markedly, with Brewer and Tasseva (2020) forecasting a 9 per cent fall, andBronka et al. (2020) a 1 per cent fall. The most likely explanation is that the former paper is an assessment of how COVID-19 is affecting incomes in April 2020 only, and the latter is making an assessment over the 2020/21 financial year.Poverty rates against a fixed poverty line are simulated to rise in Brewer and Tasseva (2020)'s analysis (from 17.4 to 19.8 per cent;Table A.4).",
