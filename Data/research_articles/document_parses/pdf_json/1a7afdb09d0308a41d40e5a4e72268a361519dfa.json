Based on phylogenetic sequence criteria, HRVs are classified into three species, including HRV-A, HRV-bronchiolitis (HRV-B), and HRV-C, 8 and more than 150 distinct serotypes according to surface proteins. 9 The prevalence and disease severity of bronchiolitis and pneumonia induced by HRV-A and HRV-C are higher than those involving HRV-B. A previous study demonstrated that HRV-B exhibits lower and slower replication and less cytopathic effects. 10 Exposure of airway epithelial cells to HRV leads to the release of proinflammatory products, which are related to pathogenic mechanisms and help initiate antiviral responses. The T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 imbalance plays an important role in immune responses to viral infections and asthma development. Previous findings indicate that rhinovirus or RSV bronchiolitis early in life is associated with an increased risk of asthma. 11, 12 Wheezing induced by HRV in young children is an important predictive factor of recurrent wheezing. 13, 14 Therefore, understanding clinical and associated immunological features of HRV would help prevent and treat HRV respiratory diseases. In this study, we aimed to assess the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HRV infection, determining the Th1-and Th2-related cytokine profiles of HRV infection in children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. showing no underlying diseases, including asthma, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency disease, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.",

Mean ages and age distributions of patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia were similar among various viral groups (P > .05). Furthermore, children with HRV infection had more frequent wheezing episodes compared with those with RSV (P a = .001) and HRV + non-RSV (P b = .002) infections among pneumonia cases, but comparable with other groups among bronchiolitis cases (P = .138). Children with a history of eczema, who did not present during the current illness were more likely to be infected with HRV than RSV (P c = .000) and HRV + non-RSV (P d = .003) among bronchiolitis cases. Similar results were found in children with pneumonia (P e = .033). Median length of hospital stay (LOS) values in HRV alone cases with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, respectively, were identical, that is, 8.5 days, and similar with those of other groups. LOS more than seven was not different in bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases among HRV alone and other viral groups (P > .05). No significant differences were found in terms of supplemental oxygen, tachypnea, and white blood count among the HRV and the other three groups (P > .05). Children with pneumonia in the HRV group were more likely to have fewer than those of the RSV (P f = .004) and HRV + RSV (P g = .005) groups. HRV associated pneumonia was less likely to occur in summer months than HRV + non-RSV (P h = .005), while HRV associated bronchiolitis was more likely to occur in winter months than RSV (P i = .01) and HRV + non-RSV (P j = .014).

In the present study, HRV was found in 19.5% of children with lower respiratory infection (LRIs), and detection rates were similar in bronchiolitis (20.5%) and pneumonia (18.9%) cases. The results revealed that HRV is not only a major viral etiology of pneumonia but also the second leading cause of bronchiolitis after RSV, corroborating previous studies. 2, 3, 17, 18 Unlike RSV, HRV showed similar incidence rates between the bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases. Many prospective long-term studies have shown that RSV-induced bronchiolitis is associated with later development of asthma. 19, 20 However, a recent cohort study suggested that infants wheezing as a result of HRV infection may be at greater risk of subsequent asthma compared with RSV, PIV, and influenza virus-infected counterparts. 21 Therefore, HRV is not only a cause of lower respiratory tract illness but also represents a significant pathogen Previous data have revealed that HRVs circulate year-round and prevail in fall and winter. 18, 24, 25 The seasonal distributions of HRVs vary F I G U R E 2 (A and B).

This study showed that HRV-induced pneumonia and bronchiolitis were prevalent in winter and spring.

Patients with HRV single infection presented more often a history of eczema than the RSV and HRV + non-RSV groups, which accorded with findings in a multicenter study. 6 Furthermore, the COAST study evaluated the relationship between HRV illness and allergic sensitization and showed that allergic sensitization may precede rhinovirus associated wheezing but not RSV infection. 30 39 Moreover, a recent study showed that the majority of HRV-infected infants display a high Th2 response, while the majority of RSV-infected infants show a Type-1 response. 40 In the current study, Th2/Th1 ratios were higher in HRV and RSV associated F I G U R E 3 IL-4/IFN-\u03b3, IL-6/IL-2, and TNF-a/IL-10 ratios in nasopharyngeal aspirates from HRV and RSV induced bronchiolitis or pneumonia and the controls. Medians are represented by horizontal bars. Note: Data in Figures 2 and 3 were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test; *P \u2264 .05; **P < .01; ***P < .001. RSV-B: bronchiolitis cases with RSV alone, RSV-P: pneumonia cases with RSV alone, HRV-B: bronchiolitis cases with HRV alone, HRV-P: pneumonia cases with HRV alone. HRV-B, human rhinovirus bronchiolitis; IL, interleukin; RSV-B, respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis; RSV-P: respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia; TNF, tumor necrosis factor bronchiolitis compared with pneumonia and control cases, reflected by increased IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 and decreased TNF-\u03b1/IL-10 ratios, which suggested that excessive Th2 or deficient Th1 response may be associated with the pathogenesis of HRV bronchiolitis. The reason why IL-6/IL-2 ratios were not significantly different between bronchiolitis and pneumonia cases in both HRV and RSV groups is difficult to explain. However, it may be explained by that IL-6 represents a potent mediator of cellular communication, is crucial for the regulation of innate and adaptive inflammatory responses, 41 and is positively associated with illness severity in RSV and HRV associated lower respiratory tract infection. 42, 43 Taken together, an imbalanced Th1/Th2 response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HRV bronchiolitis and may be one of the reasons for asthma development.",

The clinical characteristics of these two diseases caused by HRV were similar to those of RSV, except for wheezing episodes, frequency of history of eczema, fever occurrence, and seasonal prevalence. Like RSV, HRV bronchiolitis presented an imbalanced Th1/Th2 immune response in the airway mucosa.",

This might explain why HRV-B is detected at a lower frequency and causes a milder disease. Since single infections with different species had small sample sizes, we did not compare clinical characteristics among the HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C groups.",

HRV single infection-induced bronchiolitis more likely in winter than the other three infection groups, indicating that rhinovirus is an important pathogen that causes bronchiolitis in winter. Although previous reports have shown virus detection and cytokine profiles in virus-induced acute wheezing, 35,36 we assessed Th1 and Th2type cytokines secreted by patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by HRV and RSV. We found that both Th1-type (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and TNF-\u03b1) and Th2-type (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) cytokines significantly increased in HRV or RSV infected patients with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Previous studies demonstrated that HRV infection causes a massive upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the host, 37 and Th2type cytokines may reflect a chronic inflammation of the lower respiratory tract. 38 Th2-type cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 favor HRV infection by increasing the expression of ICAM-1. 34 A research in the UK demonstrated that the IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 ratio in infants with acute bronchiolitis elevated in nasal lavage fluid sample on both days 1 to 2 and days 5 to 7 of disease compared with infants suffering from upper respiratory tract infection alone.",
