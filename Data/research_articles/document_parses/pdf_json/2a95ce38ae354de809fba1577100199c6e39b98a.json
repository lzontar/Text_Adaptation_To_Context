Recent reports suggest that racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. are at increased risk of acquiring COVID-19, of experiencing greater severity of infection, and are at excess risk of death. Although efforts to collect data stratified by race on COVID-19 tests administered, confirmed cases, and deaths are necessary to understand the needs of populations of color, the public health community must recognize that not all health inequities will be captured. One ethnic group likely at increased risk of COVID-19 complications that will not be captured with stratified racial reporting is Arab Americans.",

Prior work has shown that Arab Americans' health outcomes are distinctly different from the outcomes of non-Hispanic whites, the group they are asked to identify with on standard surveys. [3] [4] [5] Recent evidence also shows that Arab American health patterns do not fit into traditional immigrant health patterns. 6, 7 The health needs of Arab Americans are unique and require dedicated and intentional data collection on health outcomes. Hospitals and community organizations should make every effort to capture data on Arab Americans affected by COVID-19 to better understand their risks and to target specific responses for this population. There are a number of reasons why Arab Americans may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, complications, and death including exposure to xenophobia and stigma, pre-existing conditions, crowded living conditions, lack of social support for new immigrants, and poor adoption of prevention behavior.",
