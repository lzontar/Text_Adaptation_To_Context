            "text": "50 51 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory illness caused by the severe acute 52 respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1 . The symptoms of COVID-19 range from 53 asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death, and the COVID-19 54 pandemic has resulted in substantial burdens on healthcare systems worldwide 2,3 . Given the 55 current state of diagnostic testing which largely relies on molecular techniques, the 56 seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in different populations remains unclear. 57 Accurate and large-scale serologic testing that includes detection of neutralizing antibodies is 58 essential in evaluating spread of infection in the community, informing public health 59 containment efforts, and identifying donors for convalescent plasma therapy trials. We first assessed the performance of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (FDA 64 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)) and IgM (prototype) assays from a cohort of five 65 outpatients and 38 hospitalized patients at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) 66 Medical Center and the San Francisco Veterans Affairs (SFVA) Health Care System. These 67 assays are chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays that target the nucleocapsid and spike 68 proteins, respectively. All patients received care at adult inpatient units or clinics and were RT-69 PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab testing (Figure 70 1A, Table S1). The percentage of patients seroconverting for IgG at weekly time intervals 71 following reported symptom onset reached 94.4% at \u2265 22 days (Figure 1B). Correspondingly, 72 IgG assay sensitivity from analysis of all 423 samples increased weekly to reach 96.9% at \u2265 22 73 days, and was 99% when samples from seven immunocompromised patients (see below) were 74 excluded (Figure 1D, Table 1). The percentage of patients seroconverting for IgM was also 75 94.4% at \u2265 22 days (Figure 1E) and IgM assay sensitivity from analysis of 346 samples was 76 97.9% (98.9% with immunocompromised patients excluded) (Figure 1G, Table 1). 77 Of the four patients who had not seroconverted for IgG by the end of 14 days (Figure 78 1B), two were kidney transplant recipients on tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 79 immunosuppressive therapy; one was >90 years old; and one was an asymptomatic patient 80 receiving acute psychiatric care who provided an unreliable history. Both renal transplant 81 recipients were observed to ultimately seroconvert for IgG and IgM. Notably, delayed 82 seroconversion for IgG and IgM was not universal in immunosuppressed patients: three 83 additional solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients on tacrolimus and MMF, as well as one patient 84 with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and infliximab, all seroconverted within two weeks. A 85 further SOT recipient was positive for IgG and IgM in the earliest available serum sample from 86 day 17 post symptom onset (Figure 2D, E) . We did not have samples beyond day 18 for the 87 remaining two patients. However, as seroconversion was observed as late as three weeks after 88 symptom onset (Figure 2D, E) , it is possible that analysis of later samples would have 89 demonstrated detectable antibodies in their serum. The one patient who was still IgG negative in 90 the 22+ day time frame (Figure 1B) (from a plasma sample collected on day 29) had only mild 91 symptoms and was positive by IgM and neutralizing antibody testing (described below). tested for IgG (n=1,013) and IgM (n=1,492) seroreactivity. Two samples out of 1,013 were 98 positive by IgG testing, yielding a specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.3-100%) (Figure 1C), 99 concordant with the 99.9% specificity reported in a study by the University of Washington 4,5 . 100 Similarly, testing of 235 remnant plasma samples from 163 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative UCSF 101 patients collected from late March to early April 2020 resulted in detection of only one positive 102 sample, yielding a specificity of 99.6% (95% CI: 97.7-100%) (Figure 1H). The IgG positive 103 sample was from a patient admitted for syncope but who reported a cough of one-month 104 duration, suggesting a potential prior infection with SARS-CoV-2. Six samples out of 1,492 from 105 US blood donors were positive by IgM testing, yielding a specificity of 99.6% (95% CI: 99.2-106 99.9%) (Figure 1F) . This was consistent with more limited testing of 39 SARS-CoV-2 PCR 107 negative UCSF patients, none of whom were positive for IgM antibody ( Figure 1I) . Thus, the 108 Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assays demonstrated high sensitivity (96.9%-97.9% at \u2265 22 109 days in a primarily hospitalized patient cohort) and specificity (99.6-99.8% in pre-COVID blood 110 donors), with good correlation (rho = 0.65) between IgG anti-nucleocapsid protein and IgM anti-111 spike protein seropositivity (Figure 2A) .",

However, in vitro neutralization activity may not confer protective immunity and the 169 efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for treatment of COVID-19 disease remains to be 170 determined.
