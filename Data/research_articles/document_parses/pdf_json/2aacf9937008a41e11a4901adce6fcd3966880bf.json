However, the degree to which protected areas achieve their conservation goals is generally unknown for many protected areas worldwide.

            "text": "Most protected areas are developed and maintained to conserve particular species or habitats. For example, the Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa was designed to conserve elephants (Swemmer & Taljaard, 2011) , or the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia was designed to protect corals and associated marine communities (GBRMPA, 2009) . A substantial body of work examining the effect of protected areas on biodiversity confirms that these parks are effective at conserving the target species or habitat (Geldmann et al., 2013; Owen-Smith, Kerley, Page, Slotow, & van Aarde, 2006; Watson et al., 2011) . However, it is not clear whether protected areas are generally also effective at protecting non-target species. Despite some keystone species or focal habitats benefiting within large, national protected areas, some of the remaining biodiversity may decline (Craigie et al., 2010; Hoekstra, Clark, Fagan, & Boersma, 2002; Watson, Dudley, Segan, & Hockings, 2014) . For example, the Maasai Mara National Reserve is a wildlife sanctuary situated in the south of Kenya and was inaugurated in 1961. Its primary conservation goals include conserving mammalian wildlife, specifically, endangered carnivores. This goal has largely been achieved as lion densities have remained high since the onset of conservation programmes (Ogutu & Dublin, 2002) , although other non-target species have declined in density, such as wildebeest (Newmark, 2008; Ottichilo, De Leeuw, & Prins, 2001) , vultures (Virani, Kendall, Njoroge, & Thomsett, 2011) and ungulates (Ogutu, Owen-Smith, Piepho, & Said, 2011) . Thus, managing an area for protection of one group or species does not necessarily protect all wildlife species, nor does it ensure the presence of specific species or taxa (van Jaarsveld et al., 1998) . This suggests that there are still critical gaps in knowledge of how effective protected areas are at protecting biodiversity in general.",

Because the statistical models we used assume abundances of common birds remain similar for the duration of the study, we restricted the analysis to data from years 2014 to 2015. These were the most data-rich years and together made up 62% of the total data volume collected during SABAP2, up to February 2016. Registered volunteers collected checklists of all bird species observed within a regular, pre-defined area called a pentad, which is a 5\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 grid cell (approximately 61 km 2 ). Our study area covers 576 pentads (a 24 pentad by 24 pentad grid), for which 10,400 checklists were submitted at an average of 18 checklists per pentad; the maximum number of checklists submitted for a single pentad was 468, and the minimum was 1 (all pentads were visited). Similar to Broms, Johnson, Altwegg, and Conquest (2014) , we used at most 100 checklists per pentad. Where pentads had more checklists than this, 100 were randomly selected.",

Gauteng is the most densely populated province in South Africa with average human density of 675.1 people per km 2 (Statistics South Africa, 2012).

The proportion of protected areas per pentad ranges from 0 to 1. The study area incorporates 81 protected areas, ranging in size from 0.08 km 2 to 816.70 km 2 , at an average of 27.65 km 2 .

The estimated average abundance of gleaners was not affected by the proportion of protected areas (Table 1) . Our results are consistent with other studies conducted in South Africa which find that in general, common species are more abundant within protected areas compared with outside of them (Child, Cumming, & Amano, 2009; Greve, Chown, van Rensburg, Dallimer, & Gaston, 2011) , as well as elsewhere throughout the world (Coetzee, Gaston, & Chown, 2014; Gray et al., 2016; Laurance et al., 2012) .

Our study primarily comprised of protected areas, urban and agricultural land use types. The level of protection provided by protected areas to a species may depend on the degree to which the species is able to adapt to neighbouring land use types (or, to habitats disturbed due to human-related activity Table 1 .

Granivores can be opportunistic, adapt quickly to new environments (Beissinger & Osborne, 1982; Chace & Walsh, 2006) and benefit from additional food sources and variety of nesting and roosting spots available in urban and agricultural land use types (Chace & Walsh, 2006; Gaston & Evans, 2004 (Barnard, 1997; Dean, 1997; Herremans, 1997a Herremans, , 1997b . Gleaners, on the other hand, were on average as abundant within pentads with a high proportion of protected areas as they were in those with low proportions (group 2, Table 1 ). This is probably because gleaners may eat insects that are attracted into urban gardens (Chace & Walsh, 2006 (Berruti, 1997a (Berruti, , 1997b Parker, 1997a Parker, , 1997b . Furthermore, in some cases, agricultural practices may increase the abundance and species richness of insects (although this depends on the intensity of farming, and the type of crop planted; Benton, Bryant, Cole, & Crick, 2002; Newton, 2004) , which may support relatively dense populations of gleaning species in agricultural lands. Thus, the ecological benefit provided by protected areas to gleaning species appears to depend strongly on the land use types surrounding protected areas.",

            "text": "A single Royle-Nichols abundance model was fitted for each of the 207 species. Models for 11 species failed to converge, likely due to data sparsity. This left 196 species to which the remainder of the results refer. The parameter \u03b2 1 measures the slope of the linear (on the log scale) relationship between mean local abundance of each species and the proportion of protected areas per pentad, while accounting for the observation process. Species with a positive estimate for \u03b2 1 were relatively more abundant in pentads with a high proportion of protected areas, and this was interpreted as the species having higher abundance inside protected areas, whereas a negative estimate for \u03b2 1 indicates the opposite. On average across all species, estimated abundance was shown to be higher inside protected areas than outside because mean \u03b2 1 was slightly positive (0.12, range from \u22124.53 to 4.23 across species). Of the 196 species, 50 (26%) had a positive \u03b2 1 and confidence intervals; 30 species (15%) had negative \u03b2 1 and confidence intervals; 116 species (59%) had their confidence intervals overlap zero (Figure 2).",

Indeed, granivores with the most negative \u03b2 1 included the village indigobird (Vidua chalybeate, \u03b2 1 = \u22122.63), scaly-feathered finch (Sporopipes squamifrons, \u03b2 1 = \u22121.93), red-headed finch (Amadina erythrocephala, \u03b2 1 = \u22121.86) and red-capped lark (Calandrella cinereal, \u03b2 1 = \u22121.55), all of which have been shown to adapt well to agricultural land use types in South Africa",
