Exploiting the restricted specificity of a 9-O acetyl sialic acid (9-OAcSA) binding lectin, Achatinin H (ATN H ), we have identified two 9-O acetyl sialoglyconjugates (9-OAcSGs) on lymphoblasts of 87 children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The preferential binding of ATN H to lymphoblasts induces their 11-fold increased agglutination (81 \u00b1 7.8%) compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of normal donors (8 \u00b1 4.3%) which corroborates with flow cytometry studies. Agglutination of MOLT-4 (87 \u00b1 4.8%), a lymphoblastoid cell line and MDCK (91.25 \u00b1 0.01%), a cell line expressing surface 9-OAcSA, confirms the preferential binding of ATN H to lymphoblasts through their surface 9-OAcSGs. Furthermore, fluorometric quantitation reveals a 4.6-fold increase in % of 9-OAcSA on lymphoblasts of ALL patients (42.1 \u00b1 4.1%) compared to normal donors (9.2. \u00b1 3.4%). Western blotting confirms that ATN H recognizes two membrane sialoglycoconjugates, of MW 120 kDa and 90 kDa, both having 9-OAcSA \u24232 \u2192 6 GalNAc terminal sugar moiety as their lectinogenic epitope.

Employing the observation that cytokines in general induce tyrosine phosphorylation in lymphoid progenitor cells and constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation is also observed in Blineage ALL, attempts have been made to block the growth of leukemic blasts by using blockers against protein tyrosine kinases. 43 Alteration in the pattern of DNA methylation have been recently reported as a biomarker in various neoplasms, including ALL. 44 Changes in the sialylation pattern of cell surface structures during malignancies are also reported. 1, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 17, 18 The present study identifies two biomarkers, 9-OAcSGs, appearing exclusively on leukemic blasts of ALL patients employing ATN H as an analytical probe. ATN H selectively binds to leukemic blasts (Figure 2a ) inducing their 11-fold increased agglutination as compared to PBMC of normal donors (Table 2 ). Since ATN H is a 9-OAcSA binding lectin (Table 1) , leukoagglutination and flow cytometry studies indirectly reflect either (1) an increase in % of leukemic blasts, expressing 9-OAcSGs; and/or (2) an increased 9-O-acetylation of surface sialoglycoconjugates on leukemic blasts. These results are further supported by fluorimetric quantitation of surface 9-OAcSA which shows a 4.6-fold increase in ALL patients as compared to normal donors ( Figure 1 ). This observation is consistent with the previous reports which state that although 9-OAcSA are present at a very low concentration in normal human serum and B lymphocytes 19 their level is markedly elevated in melanomas 18 and ALL. 20, 21 The preferential binding of ATN H to leukemic blasts through 9-OAcSGs is further envisaged by an 87% and 91% agglutination of MOLT-4 and MDCK cell lines (Table 2) , both showing a five-and eight-fold increase in the % of surface 9-OAcSA compared to normal donors ( Figure 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 558, "end": 560, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 686, "end": 688, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 790, "end": 792, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 793, "end": 797, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 798, "end": 802, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 803, "end": 807, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 808, "end": 812, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 813, "end": 817, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 818, "end": 821, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 822, "end": 824, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1755, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1804, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1817, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1820, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1020, "end": 1030, "text": "(Figure 2a", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1125, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1178, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1578, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1983, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2086, "end": 2094, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Flow cytometry studies of a representative ALL sample state that the % of FITC-ATN H positive cells (93.81%, Figure 2a ) are comparable to the cells expressing CALLA antigen (92%, Figure 2a ) as also are the % of leukemic blasts (90%) as per morphological estimates. Comparison of these three observations reiterates the selective binding of ATN H to leukemic blasts of ALL patients having an increased surface 9-OAcSGs ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, double-color flow cytometry studies, employing different fluorochromes for ATN H and anti-CALLA mAb ( Figure 3 ) reflect that they recognize two different receptors, ie 9-OAcSGs and CALLA antigen, on the surface of leukemic blasts. It is of interest that ATN H binds to leukemic blasts of patient with B cell ALL (Figure 2a, panel 2B) and also MOLT-4 ( Figure 2a, panel 3B) , a T lymphoblastoid cell line. Therefore, possibly the 9-OAcSGs, are common markers expressed on leukemic blasts of ALL patients irrespective of their B/T lineage.

After de-O-acetylation, these bands disappear indicating that these are O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins. However, in addition many other bands appear on immunoblotting with CHE-FcD (Figure 4b , Table 3 ). This can be explained by the previous report which states that unlike ATN H which binds to sialoglycoconjugates with terminal 9-OAcSA in \u24232 \u2192 6 linkage to a subterminal sugar, GalNAc, 25-30 the CHE-FcD binds to any sialoglycoconjugate having terminal 9-OAcSA irrespective of underlying structure.

Therefore, both 120 kDa and 90 kDa 9-OAcSGs, in ALL patients, binding to 125 -I-ATN H and CHE-FcD are O-acetylated glycoproteins containing a terminal 9-OAcSA.

We envisage that increased expression of 9-OAcSGs could mask binding sites of adhesion molecule(s) like CD22\u2424, thereby influencing cell adhesiondependent cellular responses namely cell proliferation and differentiation, immune responses and metastases.
