One Italian medical college recommended that \"[i]nformed by the principle of maximizing benefits for the largest number\u2026 the allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care.\" 1 In New York, pharmacists \"are beginning to sound an alarm\" that there is a lack of sedatives, pain killers and paralytics for those that require intubation and artificial ventilation. 2 Across the globe, the default criteria for allocating ventilators -and associated resources -will often be one of efficiency and maximizing the amount of lives saved, especially since decisions need to be made under extreme time constraints. Efficiency is understood as both 'maximizing the number of lives saved' and 'maximizing the number of life-years saved' (i.e., priority to those who are younger over older). For example, Emanuel and colleagues argue that \"[p]riority for limited resources should aim both at saving the most lives and at maximizing improvements in individuals' post-treatment length of life\" and further claiming that \"\u2026it is difficult to justify asking health care workers and the public to take risks and make sacrifices if the promise that their efforts will save and lengthen lives is illusory.\" 3 It is arguable that this is the majority view across much of bioethics.",

We also know that due to comorbidities, like smoking, persons with schizophrenia normally have a life expectancy that is approximately less than 15 years than those without schizophrenia. 5 And preliminary findings suggest that persons who smoke or were smokers are at a greater risk of adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19. 6 As such, under a simplistic application of utility or efficiency, it would appear the person with schizophrenia is unlikely to receive a ventilator since it would be inefficient to treat them relative to other persons without schizophrenia.",

It is important to note that some scholars who take seriously the principle of utility believe that the maximization of good ought only to occur when all people are treated as equal and impartially. Impartiality and equality of persons has long been a part of the foundation of the study of utility, especially when the principle of utility is applied in answering questions that concern the public, 7 though often ignored or forgotten in its application in the context of healthcare. In other words, the maximization of goods, such as ventilators, should not be thought of outside the parameters of equality precisely because ventilators -especially during a pandemic like COVID-19 -are public goods.",

Assuming there is no pre-existing reason why A should get a ventilator over B (e.g., using a ventilator with B would be futile), a lottery would remove the likelihood of persons being given preferential treatment on the basis of social or economic advantages. Returning to the example from the previous section, under the lottery model, persons with schizophrenia would not be further disadvantaged by the allocation criteria set forth by a hospital or regional authority.",

However, there's the rub: society pre-COVID-19 was not equal, nor is it during this pandemic. It seems somewhat disingenuous to pretend that all persons are materially equal and will have the same chances to receive ventilators, and that decisions will be based purely on clinical probability of survival that are not linked to the social determinates of health. We cannot, nor should we, expect that healthcare workers -under extreme duress of caring for patients in the ICU during a pandemic -also attempt to redress the social determinants of ill health during a pandemic. Since doctors cannot rectify existing injustices but can likely exacerbate them by maximizing the number of lives saved, then randomness is preferable to efficiency in allocating ventilators.",
