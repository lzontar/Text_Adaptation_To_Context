Here we show that local lung hypoxia, through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1\u03b1), drives Notch signalling and Krt5 pos basal-like cell expansion. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of human AEC2s from fibrotic lungs revealed a hypoxic subpopulation with activated Notch, suppressed surfactant protein C (SPC), and transdifferentiation toward a Krt5 pos basal-like state. Activated murine Krt5 pos LNEPs and diseased human AEC2s upregulate strikingly similar core pathways underlying migration and squamous metaplasia. While robust, HIF1\u03b1-driven metaplasia is ultimately inferior to AEC2 reconstitution in restoring normal lung function. HIF1\u03b1 deletion or enhanced Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity in Sox2 pos LNEPs blocks Notch and Krt5 activation, instead promoting rapid AEC2 differentiation and migration and improving the quality of alveolar repair.",

Depending on the type and severity of cellular injury, different cell types are involved in repair [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . A remarkable expansion of potentially regenerative Np63 pos /Krt5 pos cells was observed in mouse lungs infected by murine-adapted H1N1 (PR8) influenza A virus 6 . Lineage-tracing experiments showed that >80% of the expanded Krt5 pos cells arise from LNEP populations in distal airways and probably alveoli 2 . These LNEPs proliferate and migrate dramatically to damaged sites to reconstitute the alveolar epithelium and promote recovery. Specific ablation of the newly expanded Krt5 pos cells by diphtheria toxin resulted in prolonged hypoxemia, confirming involvement of these cells in the repair process 7 . Notch signalling is critical for activating this Np63/Krt5 remodelling program; however, persistent Notch signalling prevents alveolar epithelial differentiation 8 , leading to cystic structures indicative of incomplete regeneration. Similar Krt5 pos honeycombing cysts also exist in the lungs from patients with pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that common mechanisms apply to injury responses in both mice and humans 2 .",

Transplantation studies suggested the possibility that these subtypes are biased toward either basal-like or AEC2 differentiation, respectively 2 . To clarify this, we infected tamoxifen-treated p63-CreERT2 mice and determined that essentially all arising Krt5 pos cells were lineage labelled (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary  Fig. 1a) . Uninjured mice possessed p63-lineage-labelled cells scattered throughout airways, comprising <0.01% of all lung epithelial cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1b,c) . These rare cells must possess remarkable resistance to infection as well as migratory and proliferative capacity. However, the scarcity of p63 pos LNEPs and their infrequent contribution to AEC2 regeneration ( Supplementary Fig. 1a) suggest that additional p63 neg Sox2 pos LNEPs are a likely source of previously observed AEC2 differentiation following LNEP transplantation post influenza injury 2 . To begin to dissect these possibilities we considered signals that impact LNEP expansion in vivo.",

Eleven days after influenza injury, the HIF1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed a dramatic decrease in alveolar Krt5 pos cell expansion Fig. 2b,c) . We next addressed the possibility that HIF1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were less injured. Regardless of HIF1\u03b1 deletion, viral protein was detected on day 4 and cleared by day 11 (Supplementary Fig. 2d ). Both groups lost 20-30% weight ( Supplementary Fig. 2e ) and no difference was observed in the inflammatory cell counts or protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage ( Supplementary Fig. 2f,g) . Comparable large regions depleted of alveolar epithelial cells developed in all mice ( Supplementary Fig. 2h ,i). HIF1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice are therefore injured at similar levels as wild-type mice, but lack alveolar Krt5 pos cell expansion.",

Remarkably, arterial oxygen saturation in HIF1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice also recovered more quickly, and barrier function was likewise improved as judged by less interstitial and/or alveolar edema (Fig. 1h ,i and Supplementary Fig. 2k ). Furthermore, AEC2s constituted a higher fraction of the total epithelium in HIF1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice after recovery (Fig. 1j) . To address the source of the newly generated AEC2s, we deleted HIF1\u03b1 specifically in Sox2 pos cells, including both p63 pos and p63 neg LNEPs but not AEC2s, with Sox2-CreERT2/tdTomato mice (Fig. 2a) . HIF1\u03b1 deletion from the Sox2 pos lineage resulted in strong attenuation of alveolar Krt5 pos cell expansion after infection (Fig. 2b) , similar to global epithelial HIF1\u03b1 deletion (Fig. 1e) . Instead, the majority of Sox2-traced alveolar cells exhibited AEC2 differentiation, as judged by location and SPC expression (Fig. 2a,c) . Sox2-labelled AEC2s were much more proliferative than either endogenous AEC2s in the same injured regions or AEC2s in influenza-injured lungs of mice with HIF1\u03b1 deletion specifically in pre-existing AEC2s (Fig. 2d,e) . While HIF1\u03b1-driven Krt5 pos expansion supports some degree of functional recovery 7 , HIF1\u03b1 deletion substantially improves lung function by re-directing airway progenitor responses toward rapid AEC2 expansion and migration, bypassing basal-like metaplasia entirely. Given the impact of HIF1\u03b1 on the quality of epithelial recovery, we explored the mechanistic link between hypoxia and Krt5 pos cell expansion.",

Activated LNEPs showed high induction of Notch and HIF1\u03b1 target genes and Krt5 expression (Fig. 3h) . The loss of Notch activity in HIF1\u03b1-deficient cells correlates directly with the failure of Krt5 pos cell expansion in vivo in HIF1\u03b1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, injury-induced hypoxia, through HIF1\u03b1, drives Notch activity by empowering NICD binding on Notch target gene promoters, and promoting LNEP differentiation towards Krt5 pos basal-like cells. Of note, HIF1\u03b1 deletion had little apparent effect on Notch regulation of airway epithelium [15] [16] [17] (Supplementary Fig. 3f,g) .",

            "text": "Because Wnt signalling is important for the development of alveolar epithelium 18-21 , we tested whether activating Wnt could promote LNEP differentiation into AEC2s in vivo, similar to HIF1\u03b1 deletion. We crossed Sox2-CreERT2/tdTomato mice with \u03b2-catenin gainof-function mice (\u03b2-catenin loxEx3 ) to stabilize \u03b2-catenin in Sox2 pos LNEPs. \u03b2-catenin stabilization in Sox2-traced cells (tdTomato pos ) led to ectopic SPC expression in the airways even without challenge, demonstrating that Wnt activity alone could induce a fate change even in quiescent adult progenitors ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Expression of SPC and expression of Scgb3a2 (a highly specific club cell marker) 22, 23 were largely mutually exclusive, and previous reports activating \u03b2-catenin in mature club cells resulted in no increase in SPC expression 24 , indicating that most newly arising SPC pos cells were derived from Sox2 pos LNEPs and not mature club cells. After infection, Sox2traced cells expanded and differentiated primarily into Krt5 pos cells, whereas \u03b2-catenin stabilization dramatically switched differentiation from Krt5 pos to SPC pos , leading to AEC2 expansion (Fig. 4a,b) . We further explored the impact of Notch and Wnt signalling on LNEP differentiation in vitro. Treatment with the GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor CHIR99021 inhibited Notch and hypoxia target gene expression while activating Wnt target gene Axin2 expression (Fig. 4c) , indicating that Wnt activity antagonizes Notch and hypoxia signalling, favouring AEC2 differentiation of LNEPs (Fig. 4d) . ChIP experiments indicated that the inhibition occurs by prevention of NICD1 and HIF1\u03b1 association on target promoters, without affecting NICD1 protein level ( and SPC pos cells in a single-colour clone, indicating that both cell types could arise from a single cell ( Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 4c ), although some colonies were homogeneously Krt5 pos or SPC pos . Likewise, p63 neg LNEPs isolated from tamoxifen-treated p63-CreERT2 mice demonstrated \u223c10% recombination after one culture passage following addition of 4OHT ( Supplementary Fig. 4d ), confirming differentiation of p63 neg to p63 pos cells. Most p63 neg LNEPs in culture expand as either undifferentiated cells or as SPC pos cells, the latter significantly enhanced by Wnt activation (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4d) . Therefore, stabilization of \u03b2-catenin blocks Notch and hypoxia signalling, attenuates Krt5 activation, and promotes AEC2 expansion after influenza infection. Interestingly, while Krt5 pos cells in vitro arise from p63 neg LNEPs ( Supplementary Fig. 4d) , following influenza infection, activated Krt5 pos cells in vivo are derived virtually entirely from rare LNEPs already expressing p63 (Fig. 1a) rise to AEC2s two weeks post tamoxifen, retaining Krt5 expression and Notch activity ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). In the context of severe influenza infection, it appears that once the Notch/Krt5 program is activated, signals that redirect initial LNEP differentiation become ineffective in inducing transdifferentiation of Krt5-committed cells.",

In lung tissue obtained from six patients who succumbed to H1N1 influenza A virus there was widespread destruction of parenchymal cells and three patient samples evidenced an extensive regenerative response (Fig. 5a,b) . Large areas were devoid of SPC pos AEC2s and comprised instead of Krt5 pos cells that appear flattened and cover much of the alveolar surfaces, reminiscent of LNEP expansion in influenza-infected mouse lungs. In contrast to mice, some areas of affected lung contained numerous Krt5 pos cells that were also clearly positive for SPC, suggesting either differentiation of Krt5 pos cells toward AEC2s or transdifferentiation of AEC2s toward basal-like cells. This was paralleled in sections from ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) lungs ( Fig. 5c ) and by prior observations in scleroderma in which SPC pos /Krt5 pos alveolar cells were observed 2 . We conclude that as in murine influenza injury, human stem/progenitor cells demonstrate robust attempts at re-establishing alveolar epithelial barriers with Krt5 pos cells. Although variable, HIF1\u03b1 protein was also increased in all idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) samples relative to normal lungs, consistent with reports of hypoxia signalling in IPF 25,26 (Fig. 5d ). To further investigate the relationship between hypoxia and Krt5 pos cell expansion in tissue repair, we employed single-cell transcriptional profiling of epithelial cells isolated from freshly explanted diseased human lungs.",

We sequenced between 25 and 72 single cells from normal lungs as well as lungs from patients diagnosed with scleroderma, dyskeratosis congenita and IPF, all fibrotic diseases despite differing etiologies. Principal component analysis (PCA) and whole-genome unsupervised hierarchical clustering clearly separated AEC2s from normal and fibrotic lungs ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ). The Notch targets HES1 28 and SCGB3A2 22 were among the most differentially expressed genes in diseased versus normal populations, corroborating our findings in fibrotic human lungs (Supplementary Table 1 ). Furthermore, HIF1\u03b1 stands out as a top upstream regulator in the diseased AEC2s based on ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA, QIAGEN, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) (Supplementary Table 2 ). We generated a hypoxia-induced gene expression signature by combining three published hypoxia signatures 29,30 (IPA HIF1\u03b1 pathway). Hierarchical clustering based on the hypoxia signature plus Notch target HES1, KRT5 and AEC2 markers showed three distinct populations: normal AEC2s (Groups I and II), pathologic AEC2s with a hypoxia signature and high HES1 (Group III), and pathologic AEC2s with hypoxia targets and HES1, but decreased surfactants and upregulated basal cytokeratins (Group IV) (Fig. 6a -c and Supplementary Table 3 ). Adding normal basal-enriched cells (Group V) demonstrated that Group IV was transcriptionally more similar to basal-enriched cells than normal AEC2s. Groups I and II contained nearly all cells isolated from normal lungs that do not clearly segregate based on unbiased clustering, suggesting that the mild hypoxia target expression in Group II may be a technical artefact ( Fig. 6d and Supplementary Table 4 ). Adding 27 AEC2s from IPF lungs placed most IPF cells in Group IV ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ). Clustering based on the entire transcriptome except the hypoxia signature and lineage markers resulted in nearly identical clustering, validating the hypoxia signature in predictive categorization and demonstrating that meaningful whole-transcriptome (phenotypic) changes occur coordinately with hypoxia signalling (Supplementary Fig. 7c) .",

Importantly, while Group IV cells develop a basal-like transcriptome ( Fig. 6d,e) , most cells retain significant reads for SFTPC whereas no SFTPC was detected in any of the basal-enriched cells. Furthermore, culture of normal AEC2s resulted in marked upregulation of KRT5 mRNA, which was attenuated by Notch inhibition ( Supplementary  Fig. 7d) . These data support a scenario in which human epithelial progenitors utilize a common injury response pathway characterized by hypoxia/Notch/Krt5 and progressively transdifferentiate to a basallike phenotype in diverse disease and injury settings.

IPA analysis of the common upregulated genes indicates that HIF1\u03b1 is a top upstream regulator (Supplementary Table 7 ) and cell movement/invasion and proliferation are the top two processes affected (Supplementary   Tables 8,9 ).

            "text": "The lung is highly efficient at matching air and blood over its enormous alveolar surface area, ensuring oxygen uptake and S100A2  DST  FHL2  CLU  AXL  PALLD  RND3  LMO7  TROP2  ITGB8  RAB11FIP1  MUC4  SIX1  DDR1  MDK  CLDN4  TFAP2C  SOX9  EPHA2  NET1  TAZ  TIAM1  MCAM  INPP5D  PLAT  USP2  TGFB2  WASF1 VAV3 TRIM32 delivery. Injury-induced loss of alveolar epithelium leads to alveolar collapse, disrupting critical gas exchange and producing local hypoxia as oxygenated blood is diverted from non-ventilated areas 33 . Regeneration from such injury represents a major challenge given the necessity to reconstitute effective barriers over such a large area. Nonetheless, as judged by the extensive expansion of epithelial progenitor cells throughout the alveoli of flu-injured mouse lungs 2,6,7 and diversely injured human lungs (Fig. 5a-c) , the alveolar epithelium is remarkably regenerative. Whether this regenerative process results in normal or dysplastic repair, however, is dependent on several signalling pathways, and we can now provide additional insights into this process. First, we identify hypoxia itself as a key driver of Notch signalling critical to activation epithelial stem/progenitor cells (Figs 3, 6 and 7d ). Hypoxia has been previously reported to induce Notch activity in vitro 34,35 , and we now provide in vivo evidence that hypoxia drives Notch activity because HIF1\u03b1 is essential for NICD DNA binding under hypoxic conditions ( Fig. 3g and Supplementary  Fig. 3d) . Secondly, we find that hypoxia/Notch-activated progenitors in both mice and humans upregulate a common set of genes regulating motility and invasion (Fig. 7) . Live imaging confirms that activated LNEPs are highly motile within injured lung 2 as well as in in vitro migration assays (Fig. 7) . This phenotype is probably fitted to the migration across large distances through fibrinous environments required for reconstitution of alveolar barriers. That this process in lung epithelia is hypoxia driven despite the improved outcome with enhanced AEC2 expansion (Fig. 1h-j) underscores the fundamental nature of HIF1\u03b1-dependent cellular responses to acute hypoxia in all cells and its overall protective effect on survival 36 . Finally, we demonstrate that activation of Wnt or suppression of HIF1\u03b1 signalling further empowers non-AEC2 progenitors (Sox2 pos p63 neg LNEPs) to contribute to AEC2 recovery and improved lung function. Collectively, these findings highlight both the potential and the signals directing alveolar regenerative programs centred on activation of epithelial progenitors in distal airways. The ultimate fate of p63 neg and p63 pos LNEPs appears dependent on both Notch and Wnt signals not only at the level of singlecell differentiation but also at the level of amplification of fated cells by the same signals directing their initial commitment. Thus, in vivo expansion of AEC2s from Sox2 pos cells with HIF1\u03b1 deletion or stabilized \u03b2-catenin (Figs 2a and 4a ) reflects both an initial state change for p63 neg LNEPs resulting in SPC pos cells and their subsequent expansion into the injured parenchyma. Likewise, p63 pos LNEPs are the major responders to HIF1\u03b1/Notch signals producing the entire Krt5 pos response (Fig. 1a) , whereas Wnt suppresses this pathway in favour of p63 neg LNEP-derived AEC2s (Fig. 4a) . The overall outcome of basal-like metaplasia or AEC2 regeneration is largely determined by which pathway dominates the competitive selection between these populations after an initial fate choice, as indicated schematically in Fig. 7d . While Sox2 pos LNEPs are clearly an important contributor to AEC2 regeneration, surviving AEC2s are also proliferative (Fig. 2d) and doubtless participate in alveolar repair 1, 9, 37 .",

Human AEC2s appear more plastic than their murine counterparts as, unlike in mice, human AEC2s rapidly lose SFTPC and express Notch-driven KRT5 when cultured ( Supplementary Fig. 7d) . Nonetheless, our studies in mice suggest that human lungs may also face the conundrum that, once established after major injury, neither removal of Notch signalling nor Wnt stimulation reverses differentiation down the Krt5 pathway ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ), contributing to a poor functional outcome. It also remains unknown whether there is a true p63 neg LNEP in distal human airways capable of contributing to normal alveolar repair. Future studies in humans are needed to both further define the potential for airway progenitors to mobilize a regenerative alveolar program and to elucidate the micro-environmental conditions that favour predominantly AEC2 expansion.",
