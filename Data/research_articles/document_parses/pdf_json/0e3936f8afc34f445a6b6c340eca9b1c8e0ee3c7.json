Differences in the societal responses, such as various levels of social distancing and screening/quarantine implementation are probably the main reason behind the different courses that COVID-19 takes in different countries and regions. But at the same time, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is mutating, which might result in virus escape from diagnostic tests or virus resistance to therapeutic interventions. Over twenty-seven thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced as of May 15 th , 2020 and their phylogenetic analysis identified the emergence of three major viral clades (GISAID as of May 15 th , 2020). Some of the widespread mutations observed in these clades result in amino-acid substitutions. Inspection of the corresponding protein structures strongly suggests that they may have an impact on the conformation and functions of the proteins they are found in and, possibly, on the COVID-19 outcomes. While there are no confirmed clinical differences between SARS-CoV-2 from different clades, the ongoing growth of the number of mutations create a high demand for the systematic analysis of nonsynonymous mutations and their possible influence on the COVID-19 pandemics. This provided motivation for the development of the coronavirus3D server that provides a unique platform for exploring the distribution of the mutations in the context of the 3D structure of the proteins they are found in.",

If no SARS-CoV-2 structure is available, links are provided to the models based on the SARS-CoV structures. In the future we plan to incorporate ab initio models. Currently, we provide references to the resources for such predictions on the Help page. Using buttons on the top of the viewer or selecting specific regions with a mouse, users can zoom in to the display of the selected regions at higher resolution. Users can also select individual structures or models, which automatically displays information on the selected structure in the lower panels. Detailed information about the functions of the user interface is provided in the help pages available via the link located at the top of the page. The first of the lower level panels (Figure 1b) provides interactive visualization of the selected structure or model, with an option for coloring the chain according to the mutation frequency. The example in Figure 1b shows the SARS-CoV-2 structure of the complex between nsp10 and nsp16 (PDB ID: 6w4h (Rosas-Lemus, et al., 2020) ). Because chain A was selected for viewing, this chain is shown in color, with the second chain shown with lower intensity. As seen in the figure, some mutations fall on the nsp10/nsp16 interface, possibly changing the stability of the complex. The second of the lower panels ( Figure 1d ) provides a list of mutations in the selected protein (or in the selected genomic regions) that can be downloaded for further analysis.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus3D server was designed to provide users with information and tools to carry out their own analysis of how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins may affect their 3D-structures and their functions. We show here two examples of such analyses. The first example is the most common mutation in RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp or nsp12). This mutation, P323>L (genomic position 14408), is located at the interface between nsp12 and nsp8 proteins in the RdRp complex, as shown on the experimental structure of the nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex (PDB ID:6yyt (Hillen, et al., 2020) ) (Figure 1c, top) . Mutations at this interface may change the strength of the interactions in the complex and its activation profile. Interestingly, genomes with this mutation were demonstrated to have significantly (~3 times) higher mutation frequency as compared to genomes without this mutation (Pachetti, et al., 2020) . which could be related to the overactivation of the RNA polymerase complex. The second example shows the most widespread mutation in Spike glycoprotein -D614>G (genomic position 23403), visualized here on the experimental structure of the spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor (PDB ID:6vxx (Laha, et al., 2020) ) (Figure 1c, bottom) . This is the defining mutation of the G clade of the SARS-Cov-2. The corresponding position in SARS-CoV is part of an immunodominant epitope (Wang, et al., 2016) . Interestingly, the mutations mentioned in these two examples are observed in practically the same set of genomes corresponding to the G clade. It is still unclear which of these mutations (if any) contributes to the apparent recent expansion of the G clade.",
