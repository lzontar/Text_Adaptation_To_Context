In this study, we performed untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses of plasma from a cohort of COVID-19 patients who had experienced different symptoms.

We found a positive correlation between the alteration of metabolites and the course of disease deterioration in fatal patients ( Figure 1A and Table S4 ), indicating that the development of disease affects the metabolism of metabolites. A prominent signature observed among fatal COVID-19 patients was an acute reduction of free amino acids in patient plasma over the course of COVID-19. For instance, L-Malic acid exhibited the greatest log2 FC (-5. 2) among all significantly altered amino acids in the fatalities. These free amino acids are rapidly consumed in inflammatory states to provide energy and materials for the proliferation and phagocytosis of immune cells (11), indicating that immune system were activated in these cases.",

We observed that the levels of some nucleotides and organic acids were significantly increased (e.g., hypoxanthine), whereas the levels of some nucleotides and organic acids were significantly reduced [e.g., Guanosine 7 Monophosphate (GMP)]. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) is an important enzyme involved in nucleotide recycle pathway and can covert hypoxanthine and guanine to inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) and GMP, respectively (12, 13) . The observed abnormal levels of hypoxanthine and GMP suggested that the function of HPRT had become defective in these COVID-19 fatal patients, which could result in the disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism. In addition, we observed that the level of carbamoyl phosphate was significantly and gradually reduced over the course of COVID-19 fatalities. Carbamoyl phosphate is synthesized from free amino donors by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) in mitochondria of liver cells, and participates in the urea cycle to remove excess ammonia and produce urea (14-17). Its reduction in fatal cases of COVID-19 suggests the possibility of liver damage, which could also impair amino acid metabolism.",

Among them, L-malic acid and Glycerol 3-phosphate showed the greatest reduction when comparing the fatality patients with healthy volunteers, and also showed dramatic reduction in both severe and mild groups. L-malic acid has important physiological functions, as it can directly enter the circulation of tricarboxylic acid to participate in human metabolism. Besides, L-malic acid can accelerate metabolism of ammonia to lower ammonia concentration in liver and to protect liver (23, 24); therefore, the dramatic reduction of L-malic acid is consistent with the hepatic impairment associated with COVID-19. Moreover, L-malic acid has been found to protect endothelial cells of human blood vessels and resist damage to endothelial cells. D-Xylulose 5-phosphate (Xu-5-P) is a metabolite of the hexose monophosphate pathway that mediates glycolysis, as well as fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis. Xu-5-P is the coordinating signal that both activates phosphofructokinase in glycolysis and promotes transcription of the genes for lipogenesis, the hexose monophosphate shunt, and glycolysis, and is required for de novo synthesis of fat and hepatic energy utilization (25-28). The reduction of Xu-5-P indicates the downregulation of glycolysis and lipogenesis, which is also a reflection of hepatic impairment. 12 Carbamoyl phosphate is an important intermediate metabolite involved in removing excess ammonia in the urea cycle (14, 15) . This metabolite is the downstream product of CPSI in mitochondria of liver cells. The observed downregulation of carbamoyl phosphate levels is associated with the severity of COVID-19, as its level in the mild patients were affected in the least extent. Importantly, the dramatic reduction of carbamoyl phosphate is usually associated with urea cycle disorder, raising the concern about the possibility of hyperammonemia and hyperammonemia-associated liver failure in COVID-19 patients.",

The ESI source operation parameters were as follows: ion source, turbo spray; source temperature 550 \u2103; ion spray voltage (IS) 5500 V; ion source gas I (GSI), gas II (GSII), curtain gas (CUR) were set at 55, 60, and 25 psi, respectively; the collision gas (CAD) was medium. Instrument tuning and mass calibration were performed with 10 and 100 \u03bcmol/L polypropylene glycol solutions in QQQ and LIT modes, respectively. QQQ scans were acquired as MRM experiments with collision gas (nitrogen) set to 5 psi. DP and CE for individual MRM transitions was done with further DP and CE optimization. A specific set of MRM transitions were monitored for each period according to the metabolites eluted within this period.Plasma mentalities and lipids data analysisThe mass spectrum data were processed by Software Analyst 1.6.3. The repeatability of metabolite extraction and detection can be judged by total ion current (TIC) and multi peak MRM. Based on MWDB (metadata database) and other databases, qualitative analysis of information and secondary general data was carried out according to retention time (RT) and letter ion.
