            "text": "Purpose Based on the recent literature, chest computed tomography (CT) examination could aid for management of patients during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of chest CT in management of COVID-19 patients is not exactly the same for medical or surgical specialties. In orthopaedic or trauma emergency, abdomen, pelvis, cervical, dorsal, and lumbar spine CT are performed to investigate patients; the result is a thoracic CT scan incorporating usually the thorax; however, information about lung parenchyma can be obtained on this thorax CT, and manifestations of COVID-19 can be diagnosed. The objective of our study was to evaluate this role in orthopedic patients to familiarize orthopaedists with the value and limits of thoracic CT in orthopaedic surgery. Materials and methods Among the 1397 chest CT scans performed during the pandemic period from 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, in two centres with orthopaedic surgery, we selected all the 118 thoracic or chest CT performed for patients who presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital with a diagnosis of trauma for orthopaedic surgical treatment. Thirty-nine of these 118 patients were tested with PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Depending on clinical status (symptomatic or non-symptomatic), the information useful for the orthopaedist surgeon and obtained from the Chest CT scan according to the result of the PCR (gold standard) was graded from 0 (no or low value) to 3 (high value). The potential risks of chest CT as exposure to radiation, and specific pathway were analyzed and discussed. A group of patients treated during a previous similar period (1 March 2018 to 15 April 2018) was used as control for evaluation of the increase of CT scanning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Among the 118 patients with chest CT, there were 16 patients with positive COVID-19 chest CT findings, and 102 patients with negative chest CT scan. With PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 81%, 93%, and 86%, respectively (p = 0.001). A useful information for the orthopaedic surgeon (graded as 1 for 71 cases, as 2 for 5 cases, and as 3 for 11 cases) was obtained from 118 chest CT scans for 87 (74%) patients, while the CT was no value in 30 (25%) cases, and negative value in one (1%) case. Roughly 20% of the total number of CT scanner performed over the pandemic period was dedicated to COVID-19, but only 2% were for orthopaedic or trauma patients. However, this was ten times higher than during the previous control period of comparison. Conclusion Although extremely valuable for surgery management, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied are not specific for COVID-19, and the positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, which was the case during this period.",

The method proposed as gold standard for detection of the \"genetic sequence of COVID-19 nucleic acid\" is the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this RT-PCR test has limitations. First, false-negative results may occur with PCR test because of technical procedural error, insufficient \"viral\" material in the specimen, and incorrect sampling location of the swab test. Therefore, the PCR tests for COVID-19 have high specificity but sensitivity has been reported to be as low as 59%. Second, the RT-PCR test is a time-consuming process. The result of these limitations is the delay for medical isolation with risk of infection transmission, which may be a problem for a patient needing access to the operating room. At the end, this test is not available everywhere.",

The dose-length product (DLP) was used to quantify the amount of radiation used to perform chest CT examinations [4] . The principal concern for any patient undergoing a diagnostic chest CT examination is the risk of developing a radiation-induced cancer, which may be fatal. The total patient risk is related to the effective dose, which depends on the dose to each organ, as well as its radio-sensitivity, and is measured in sieverts (Sv) [4] . At the (low) doses associated with diagnostic radiologic examinations, the radiation risk is generally taken to be proportional to the cumulative organ dose. The radiation risk from two CT scans, for example, would be approximately twice the risk of a single scan, irrespective of the time interval between the two CT scans.",

CT findings have confirmed the diagnosis in a number of patients with an initial false-negative RT-PCR result [6, 7] . In our study, we found 28 patients with negative initial RT-PCR results and the mean interval time between initial negative to positive results was 6.2 days, but could be as long as 15 days. Furthermore, in two cases, PCR was negative two times before being positive; a positive chest CT demonstrating lesions that appeared on the first day is a useful tool for an urgent surgical indication. The reverse situation may exist but is rare (two cases in our series). Therefore, the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 is considered to have high specificity but sensitivity has been reported to be as low as 59% [1] .",

Immunosuppression, cardiac comorbidities, chronic pulmonary disorder, or multiple other medical comorbidities, when associated to COVID-19 are probably contra-indication to general anaesthesia and open surgery, and rather indication to loco regional anaesthesia and plaster; but to take this decision, the surgeon needs to know the COVID status of the patient in emergency. Also, if the patient is COVID-19, the number of residents and ancillary staff in the OR should be limited whenever possible. Proper training for members of the operative team is required. Lastly, surgical scrubs worn during the procedure should be changed immediately afterward. During this pandemic, essential surgical services must be performed while minimizing risk of COVID transmission to healthcare workers [10, 11] , and in some circumstances chest CT scan can help [12] for that.",

They also are recommending against postponing high-acuity surgery. However, in reality, even in emergency, each surgeon knows that there is an incompressible time for the patient to arrive in the operating room; the wait time will be determined by the urgency of the case and the risk incurred by the surgery itself, but may be it should not be as long as the result of the PCR test.",

Currently, there are no valid guidelines for determining the time interval for subsequent patients. However, between 30 minutes to one hour of room downtime is recommended for environmental cleaning and equipment decontamination using hospital approved methods such as hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet light, phenolic, or sodium hypochlorite [13] . Another concern is cross infection during the CT scan: strict protective measures are very important, and it is best to use dedicated machine for suspected patients to avoid that CT act as a virus transmission vectors, thereby exacerbating COVID-19 spread among staff and COVID-19 na\u00efve patients. A modern healthcare system can be compared to an ecosystem, in which multiple diverse sub-systems are linked and alterations to one component of the system may have profound and dramatic repercussions on remote components. Our current study focuses on the cost of chest CT according to the increase time consuming for trauma patients. Despite cost reflects the fact that resources are consumed once they are allocated to a particular patient, and as a consumed resource cannot be used by any other patient, there is of course a limit. Our rough estimation was a ten-time increase of the time devoted for chest CT scan outside the pandemic, corresponding to 118 hours, and less than 2% of the global CT scan activity. This was acceptable, but because of the pandemic, many indications of CT were postponed, and the centre had four CT scans running during the pandemic allowing one dedicated CT; it could have been different in a centre with only one CT scan.",

As regards to the doses of radiation, a low-dose chest CT scan represents more than radiographs, and doses are of the same magnitude as doses from average natural background doses (including radon exposure) each year, i.e., 3 mSv/year, which can be acceptable for one CT and for one individual. However, the recent biological effects of radiation report [4] estimates (theoretically) of approximately one radiation-induced cancer per 10,000 individuals with an age distribution similar to that of the entire US population exposed to 1 mSv. With a pandemic period of more than four million people affected by COVID-19 disease, if a CT scan was used for diagnosis, the estimation of radiation-induced cancer could reach from a theoretical point of view 1200 persons. This theoretical risk is to balance with the real 300,000 deaths related to the disease in the world. Therefore assuming that low-dose radiation risks exist, of course, patients should not be exposed unless there is a net benefit (i.e., the benefit is greater than the risk); here the benefit for the patient would be to avoid to be directed in a wrong pathway to avoid disease transmission with a benefit which is probably true for elderly patients with a risk of mortality, but less evident for young patients.",

Second, PCR detection may be affected by many factors: laboratory reagents, test method used, and operability. In our study, during the early period of the pandemic, we used RT-PCR assays in a relatively low number, as the test was not available for all the patients; the sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 might be overestimated in the early period. However during the second period (from 15 March to 10 May), the value of CT scan was confirmed. However, CT results should not be overstated. The findings observed on CT (e.g., ground-glass opacity, consolidation) are not \"specific\" for COVID-19. For example, similar findings would probably be observed if CT was used during an influenza epidemic. Using only CT for diagnosis could lead to a false security when CT is negative; this was observed for one of our patients. If COVID-19 is suspected, the patient should be isolated. The result of one CT scan does not change that.",
