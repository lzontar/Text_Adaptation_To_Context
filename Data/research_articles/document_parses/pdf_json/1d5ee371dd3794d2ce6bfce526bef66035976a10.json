It was thought that coronaviruses only infected animals but recent findings indicate that a variety of these viruses can infect humans. Some coronaviruses result in common cold symptoms. Three specific strains of these viruses are of zoonotic origin: acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, and have caused lethal infections in humans. Generally, coronaviruses replicate in the respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells and subsequently cause cytopathic alterations. The spike S glycoprotein plays an important role in host range restriction by attaching virons to the host cell membrane.",

In addition the virus can remain on glass, metal and plastic for several days, maintaining their virulence at room temperature from 2 hours to 9 days. Humidity affects the activity of the virus, high humidity increases activity. Figures present modes of cross infection from the patient to dentist to materials/equipment to other patients and staff. The importance of hand washing and avoidance of facial contact is stated. Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, protective goggles, gowns, helmet, gloves, caps, face shields and shoe covers are recommended.

When care is delivered the above precautions should be taken.It should be stressed that the COVID-19 pandemic environment is a changing environment where research is rapid and advice and actions change accordingly. Take for example the association of the BAME community with risk of infection and serious consequence. 2 This publication provides useful information to front-line dentists in their role in disrupting the transmission of the virus and protecting themselves and teams. It does not provide useful guidance to the practice of routine dental care for the future. On the issue of the future of dental practice and disease management this pandemic shows the importance of prevention and minimally invasive procedures to the delivery of dental care for both dentist and patient. 3 Visiting Professor Community General Dental Practice, Faculty of Life Sciences and Education, University of South Wales, Glyntaff, Pontypridd , Wales, CF37 4BD",
