Alcohols target the bacterial cell envelope, with resultant lysis of the cell and release of the cellular content. Also, it is well established that lipophilic, enveloped viruses are easier to deactivate by alcohols than the non-enveloped viruses [1] . Nobuji Noda [2] reported Influenza-A (USSR/92/97) was disinfected by a 1 minute exposure to ethanol with a concentration of 30~40 v/v%. Recently Akemi Shinmyo [3] reported careful experimental results on five different strains of Influenza-A, where all viruses were disinfected by 1 minute exposure to ethanol at 27-36 v/v% (by reading result with reduction ratio 1/100). We quickly performed the same test with a common laboratory E. coli strain (DH5alpha), and observed that the bacterium becomes non-viable at an ethanol concentration of 30 v/v%. E. coli is a gram negative bacteria, which also has a lipid outer layer and is thus sensitive to ethanol. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged from China with a total of 113,702 laboratory-confirmed cases (as of March 9, 2020) [4] . COVID-19 has become a global health concern, and is causing huge economical impact due to freezing industrial activity closely linked with supply chains in Wuhan, China, and blocking traffics in many countries. There is no vaccine yet developed, and standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, and covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing. One of the problems is that some spread might be possible before people show symptoms. Another problem is the suspected longer incubation time associated with this virus. We urgently need an additional preventative measure, which can stop, or at least slow down, the spread of this novel coronavirus.

When we spray the ethanol solution on a surface for disinfection, for example, a door knob, we have to be careful about the time-dependent decay of the ethanol concentration inside the water droplet. As seen in the later section, the vapor pressure of ethanol is much higher than that of water, thus ethanol evaporates faster, and the remaining solution becomes simple water quickly. The mean-free path of molecules in solution is roughly 0.1 nm at room temperature, and it will take more than times collisions for a molecule to travel a few micro-meters to reach the surface, even in a straight pass, thus the diffusion phenomena dominates. The speed of evaporation of ethanol can be estimated by the diffusion speed of ethanol molecules within a droplet.

The diffusion constants of ethanol are listed in Table-1 , and typical diffusion parameters are listed in Table-2 . An idea to use ethanol-water spray having 10 droplet size, for inhalation purposes, does not work. The reason is that, as seen in Table-2, to travel 6 , it takes only 0.01 sec, and assuming 3 m/sec spray speed, the droplet after flying 30 mm in air, all ethanol will diffuse out. The droplets become water, containing only low density ethanol, and thus will not be effective for disinfection. Thus, if we use the spray for ethanol disinfection experiments, the outcomes would fluctuate greatly, and always higher concentration would be required. Also, in practice, the ethanol spray should be avoided, because of possible fire accident.

The diffusion time of an ethanol molecule for half of this gap is roughly 0.3 sec in air estimated from Eq. (1). The inhalation cycle time has to be longer than 0.3 seconds, so that the ethanol molecules can reach the nasal surfaces. After this period, we have to refresh the ethanol vapor, because most of ethanol molecules should be adsorbed into the mucous membrane. The air flow inside the nasal cavity is turbulent, due to the narrow and complicated pathway, which also accelerates the molecule adsorption speed.

The alcohol evaporates faster than the water. In physics term, this is expressed in terms of vapor pressure. The vapor pressure of ethanol is higher than that of the water, that is why the alcohol distillation process works. We utilize this principle to bring the ethanol into our respiratory tract at higher concentration, efficiently and safely.

The vertical axis is the volume change of lung from the average volume at the relaxed breathing. During the inhalation, each breath should be around 100 ml, and eight repeats of shallow inhalation/exhalation through nose should be performed, followed by a few seconds of relaxed breathing outside the cup (providing oxygen). You may drink a small amount of the alcohol, cleaning around the pharynx, if permitted according to your age and local laws. We repeat this process for a few times, roughly one or two minutes in total. If you feel drunken, you have to control the breath shallower. their boiling temperatures are very low ( , ), and they will thus not condense inside our body. Therefore we may neglect contributions from the air in the following discussions. The presence of the air makes mass transfer speeds slower, but the ethanol concentration in the condensed alcohol stays unchanged. We also neglect CO2 in the expired gas, because it is a fairly small proportion. We treat only two components: ethanol and water in the following discussions.
