            "text": "A series of substituted and fused heterocyclic derivatives 2-17 were synthesized using 3,5-bis(4methoxybenzylidene)-1-propylpiperidin-4-one (1) as starting material. Treatment of 1 with malononitrile or semicarbazide afforded compounds 2 and 3, respectively. Condensation of 1 with ethyl cyanoacetate afforded naphthyridine-3-carbonitrile derivative 4, which reacted with phosphorus pentachloride and phosphoryl chloride to give chloro derivative 5. Treatment of 5 with thiosemicarbazide afforded compound 6. The reaction of 1 with malononitrile gave cyano aminopyrane derivative 7 which was condensed with pyromellitic dianhydride, phthalic anhydride, succinic anhydride, or morpholine in glacial acetic acid to obtain imide derivatives 8-11. Additionally, the reaction of 7 with aromatic aldehydes gave derivatives 12a-12c. Acetylation of 7 with acetic anhydride in boiling acetic acid gave N-acetyl derivative 13 which was cyclized to pyridine derivative 14 by refluxing in dioxane in the presence of triethylamine. Treatment of 7 with hydrazine hydrate gave pyrazolo derivative 15. Finally, the reaction of 7 with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of acetic anhydride gave formimidate 16 which was treated with hydrazine hydrate to form N-amino derivative 17. Some of the synthesized compounds were examined in vitro for their antitumor activity against HepG-2, PC-3, and HCT-116 human carcinoma cell lines using MTT assay.",

            "text": "Pyridinones and their derivatives play an essential role in several biological processes and are of considerable chemical and pharmacological importance [1 -3] . Moreover, pyridinones represent a unique class of pharmacophores which are encountered in various therapeutic agents [4] , antibiotics [5] , and antibacterial [6] , antifungal [7] , and cardiotonic agents [8] . On the other hand, pyran and pyridine derivatives are widely used as anticoagulant, anticancer [9, 10] , antiviral [11] , antitumor [12] , and anti-inflammatory agents [13] . Additionally, pyran derivatives are well known for their antihistaminic [14] and antimicrobial activity [15] and inhibition of influenza virus sialidases [16] . Apart from biological importance, some 2-amino-4H-pyrans are widely used as photoactive materials [17] . We previously synthesized some new pyridine and pyran derivatives which were used as analgesic, anticonvulsant, anti-anxiety, and antiparkinsonian agents [18] [19] [20] . We have recently [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] prepared some new heterocyclic compounds and evaluated them as antiinflammatory [21, 22] , anti-HSV-1 [23] , and antimelanoma [24] activities; they can also be used as activators of tumor suppressor protein p53 [25] and SARS-CoV 3C-like protease inhibitors [26] . In continuation of our previous work in heterocyclic chemistry, we synthesized some new heterocyclic compounds and tested them for anticancer activity.",

The condensation of 1 with ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of anhydrous ammonium acetate in anhydrous ethanol gave the corresponding naphthyridine-3-carbonitrile derivative 4. Treatment of the latter with a mixture of phosphorus pentachloride and phosphoryl chloride furnished chloro derivative 5. The reaction of 5 with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of few drops of triethylamine furnished thiosemicarbazide 6 (Scheme 1).Compound 1 reacted with malononitrile in the presence of piperidine to produce aminocyanopyran derivative 7 which was condensed with pyromellitic dianhydride in acetic acid to obtain the corresponding bis-imide 8.

The cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . The antitumor activity against HepG-2, PC-3, and HCT-116 human cancer cell lines was estimated using the 3-(4,5dimethyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, which is based on cleavage of the tetrazolium salt by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . The cells were dispensed in a 96-well sterile microplate (5 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well) and incubated at 37\u00b0C with series of each tested compound or Doxorubicin \u00ae (positive control) in DMSO at different concentrations for 48 h in a serum-free medium prior to the MTT assay. After incubation, the media were carefully removed, 40 \u00b5L of MTT (2.5 mg/mL) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for an additional 4 h. The purple formazan dye crystals were solubilized by addition of 200 \u00b5L of DMSO, and the absorbance was measured at \u03bb 590 nm using a SpectraMax \u00ae Paradigm \u00ae Multi-Mode microplate reader. The relative cell viability was expressed as the mean percentage of viable cells compared to the untreated control cells. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and repeated in three different days. The IC 50 values were determined by probit analysis using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).",
