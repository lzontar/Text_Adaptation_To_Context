In view of the fact that patients requiring surgery may be asymptomatic carriers of the virus, it is not unreasonable that ALL PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIAC SURGERY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BE SCREENED FOR THE VIRUS. This will identify those patients who will require isolation perioperatively and those health care workers who must wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in caring for these patients. If available, surgery should be performed in an OR with a negative pressure environment to reduce the dissemination of the virus to locations outside the OR (4). If a negative pressure room is not available, a higher frequency of air exchanges will help to more rapidly reduce the viral load within the OR. In addition, it will be important to report the profiles, surgical procedures, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients undergoing cardiac surgery to national databases, such as the STS, to better understand the risk for patients and health care workers.",

Since the respiratory system is the most common site for severe COVID-19 infections, and in view of the fact that a significant number of patients will have underlying pulmonary disease and a history of smoking, sputum specimens should be obtained in addition to nasopharyngeal swabs to detect underlying pulmonary bacterial infections which could contribute to postop pulmonary insufficiency requiring prolonged ventilatory support.

            "text": "It was hypothesized that short-term intranasal mupirocin, used as part of a perioperative prophylactic regimen, might not be associated with the emergence of MR. However, several studies have showed that when mupirocin is indiscriminately used as prophylaxis prior to surgical procedures, the prevalence of MR is increased. Bathoorn etal looked at the effects of short-term mupirocin therapy (24 hours prior to surgery and twice daily for 5 days postop) given to all surgical patients over a 5 year period (12) . There was a significant increase of high level MR to coagulase negative staphylococcus from 8% to 22%. Furthermore, isolates with high level MR were less susceptible to ciproflaxcin, clindamycin, and erythromycin. The authors concluded that not only could the routine use of mupirocin for prophylaxis in all surgical patients result in increased MR, it could also diminish the effectiveness of perioperative antibiotics for organisms other than staph species. Hetem etal studied the effects of nasal mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine soap for 5 days as surgical prophylaxis given to all patients irrespective of their staph aureus carrier status (13) . High level MR was 21% in coag negative patients prior to mupirocin but increased to 43% after mupirocin therapy. MR was associated with resistance to oxacillin, aminoglycosides, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxide and rifampicin. In a study from South Africa, Wasserman etal found that the indiscriminate use of mupirocin to decolonize all patients increased the incidence of high level MR to 23.3% and was associated with resistance to cloxacillin and fluroquinolones (14) . Rudresh etal found that when mupirocin was used to treat all patients; high level MR to staph aureus was 10.5% and was associated with resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, ciprofloxin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin (15) . They concluded that the use of mupirocin should be based on nasal cultures and that the widespread use of mupirocin should be avoided.",

Van den Bergh etal have shown that this group of patients will benefit from more stringent glycemic control (serum glucose < 150 mg/dl) and that this will result not only in decreased sternal wound infections; but a significant decrease in operative mortality (17) . Patients with COVID-19 may be more likely to be in the hospital for > 3days prior to their surgery and /or transferred to a tertiary hospital or an ICU. MRSA may be a special concern in these patients and adding Vancomycin to these patients is not unreasonable, especially in those patients who will require a valve prosthesis or a vascular graft. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic are more likely to require more extensive procedures requiring extended periods of cardiopulmonary bypass and surgeries lasting more than 4 hours. Intraoperative redosing of Cefazolin has been found to reduce infections by 16% in procedures lasting more than 4 hours and following 120 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass (20, 21) . Topical antibiotics, such as Vancomycin paste, applied to the cut edges of the sternum upon opening and closing, have been found to dramatically reduce the incidence of all sternal wound infections (22) . In contrast, bone wax acts as a foreign body, prevents bone union, and has been found to be an independent risk factor for sternal dehiscence and wound infections (23) . It should not be used in patients undergoing a sternotomy, especially in those infected with the COVID-19 virus.",

Mayeur etal cite concerns for healthcare workers as the reasons for not obtaining nasal swabs. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, all patients scheduled for cardiac surgery who have tested positive for the virus, or in whom the viral status is unknown should all be treated by healthcare providers using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The same precautions used to intubate these patients for surgery should also be used when obtaining nasal swabs to detect staph carriers. IN SUMMARY, THE INDISCRIMINATE USE OF INTRANASAL MUPIROCIN IN THE ABSENCE OF NASAL STAPHYLOCOCCUS CARRIERS IS HARMFUL AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED. THIS PRACTICE WOULD BE GIVEN A CLASS III RECOMMENDATION. PERIOPERATIVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL Optimizing glycemic control is essential to not only eliminate all sternal wound infections, but also to decrease morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients undergoing cardiac surgery; especially since a significant number of these patients will have diabetes mellitus and suboptimal glycemic control. The following are CLASS I recommendations from both the AATS and STS guidelines (3,16): ***OPTIMIZING GLYCEMIC CONTROL IS RECOMMENDED IN PATIENTS WITH ELEVATED HbA1c LEVELS (>7.5) AND SERUM GLUCOSE LEVELS > 200mg/dl PRIOR TO ANY CARDIAC SURGERY PROCEDURE. ***ALL PATIENTS UNDERGOING CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY SHOULD HAVE A FASTING GLUCOSE AND A HbA1c PRIOR TO SURGERY. ***DURING SURGERY, INSULIN INFUSIONS SHOULD BE INSTITUTED TO MAINTAIN SERUM GLUCOSE < 180 mg/dl. ***CONTINUOUS INSULIN INFUSIONS SHOULD BE INTITIATED IN THE ICU FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS TO MAINTAIN SERUM GLUCOSE < 180 mg/dl. ***PATIENTS WHO REQUIRE > 3 DAYS OF ICU CARE DUE TO VENTILATORY, INOTROPIC OR MECHANICAL SUPPORT, OR THE NEED FOR ANTIARRYTHMIC AGENTS SHOULD HAVE SERUM GLUCOSE LEVELS < 150 mg/dl.",

This is especially important for COVID-19 patients who may already have gram negative organisms in their tracheobronchial tree as a result of their viral infection. ***AN AMINOGLYCOSIDE SHOULD BE ADDED FOR 1 PREOPERATIVE AND AT MOST 1 POSTOPERATIVE DOSE FOR GRAM NEGATIVE COVERAGE WHEN VANCOMYCIN IS THE PRIMARY PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTIC ( CLASS IIb). Since aminoglycosides have been associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity following cardiopulmonary bypass, a single postoperative dose of no more than 4 mg/kg should be administered . Subsequent doses should be administered based on culture results. ***VANCOMYCIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED BETWEEN 60 AND 120 MINUTES PRIOR TO THE INCSISION AND AT MOST FOR ONLY 1 ADDITIONAL DOSE WHEN IT IS USED WITH A CEPHALOSPORIN (CLASS I). ***A CEPHALOSPORIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED WITHIN 60 MINUTES OF A CARDIAC SURGICAL PROCEDURE AND REDOSED FOR PROCEDURES LASTING > 4 HOURS (CLASS I).",
