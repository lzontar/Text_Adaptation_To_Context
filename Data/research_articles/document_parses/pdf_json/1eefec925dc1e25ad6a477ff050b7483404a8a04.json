The objective is not to precisely estimate the exact number of cases or the magnitude of the epidemic in absolute manner, but to understand how the disease can spatially and temporally spread countrywide. In particular, we illustrated three scenarios: in the first scenario, the model estimates the disease transmission by calculating the expected number of cases and municipalities affected by the virus between 26 February and 6 March. We focused on the first ten days of the epidemic because most of the impact that commuting may have had is before the application of the lockdown measures. In the second scenario we explore and compare the spread patterns in three different regions (Lombardy, Abruzzi and Basilicata), which were differently affected by the COVID-19 spread. In scenario 3, the local spread in the Abruzzi region is simulated to define the vulnerability of each municipality to a resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic during future partial or total easing of the lockdown measures.",

Although the map of contact rates mainly reflects the resident population density, the municipality-specific contact rate captures the disease permeability of each municipality, considering the population in different moment of the day and depicting the characteristic of municipalities as attractor of commuters or as diplacer of its workforce elsewhere. The clusterization of geographical areas with similar characteristics in terms of vulnerability to the introduction and spread of the disease is highlighted by Moran's analysis ( Figure 5b ). It is evident that there are large areas characterized by the homogeneous presence of high \u03b2 values (pink areas). In these areas, the introduction of the disease inevitably leads to a spread more difficult to control due to the simultaneous presence of connections between .

However, the differences are more evident between the three regions if we consider the number of infected municipalities that grows more rapidly in the case of Lombardy ( Figure 11b ).

The mobility of workforces in Lombardy, which is one of the major economic driving areas in Europe, is much greater than in the other two regions. The differences among these regions are more evident when the increase of the number of infected municipalities is considered (Figure 11b ), being the infection spreading across municipalities directly linked to the connections underlying the commuting network.

In particular, the degree calculated for the sub-network built on the basis of incoming and outgoing commuters greater than 50 (Deg50) and COVID-19 cases (on the 26 March 2020) have the highest correlation value equal to 0.72 (black bordered square in Figure 4a).

It is evident that the northern provinces, most affected by the disease, are also those characterized by a high degree (flow of commuters among multiple provinces) and high strength (incoming and outgoing commuters exchanged) while the provinces of central and southern Italy, with a lower number of cases, are mainly characterized by lower degree and in-strength values.",

Although we have reduced the number of parameters of the epidemiological model from one side, we have introduced other variables to model the socio-demographic and commuting aspects, as detailed in Supplementary Information. The revised calculation of the infection contact rate \u03b2, based mainly on the resident population density, also incorporates the commuting component in each municipality, highlighting its characteristic of being an attractor of commuters or a displacer of workforces toward elsewhere. When areas with a high \u03b2 values are contiguous and significantly clustered, disease permeability tends to be greater. Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna (situated in the northern Italy), which together made up 52% of all Italian cases (as of May 7, 2020), are effectively clustered with similar and high \u03b2 values (Figure 5b).",

One of the possible explanations for this disagreement may be found in the application of control measures by local authorities, which anticipated the measures of the central government.
