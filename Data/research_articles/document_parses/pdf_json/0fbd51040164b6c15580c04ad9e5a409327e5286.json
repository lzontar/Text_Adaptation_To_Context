There are many parallel factors occurring on the global front that may adversely affect capacity of public health to respond and protect the population it serves. Political violence, civil war, ethnic and religious conflicts, and in particular, the generation of millions of refugees by forced migration are obvious factors that are changing the balance between human beings and microorganisms (Pirages, Runci, & Sprinkle, 2001) . Competing with public health's capacity to mitigate the effects of forced displacement are demographic and ecological factors such as increased population growth and density, urban migration and urbanization, failures of governance and the protection of public health infrastructures, human invasion of the habitats of animals and arthropods, and population induced environmental change.",

Indeed, whether these bioevents, accidental or deliberate, result in risk to populations locally, nationally, regionally or internationally lies squarely on the capacity of public health and a nation-state's capacity to ensure public health viability. However, public health can no longer be narrowly confined to aspects of preventive healthcare. Increasingly 'public health' is understood in the context of multidisciplinary and multi-sector capacities of governance and political will, economics, judiciary, public safety, quality of public health utilities, health security, agriculture, communication, transportation, education and training, and other capacities that allow a village, town, city, and nation-states to functionally protect its citizens (Burkle, 1999) . Current wars, internal conflict, refugees, migration, and the consequential worry over the spread of infectious disease have synonymously become, right or wrong, a catalyst to what some fear is either a prelude to a downward trend or eventual worldwide collapse of public health as we know it (Doyle, 2004; Glasser, 2004) . Additional questions arise as to the relationship, if any, with the emergence or re-emergence of at least 40 infectious diseases, as well as an unprecedented increase of once-controlled and now antibiotic resistant infections, all in less than one decade (Heymann & Rodier, 1998 Paluzzi & Farmer, 2004) . Any infectious disease emerging locally has immediate global ramifications. This is occurring in a world where the generous predictions of a decade ago of an emerging global economy have failed to emerge, but a state of global health is here to stay. As such, issues of war, conflict, migration, politics and whether they significantly impact global concerns of infectious disease are worth exploring.",

Little appreciation was given at the time to Charter language which guaranteed that what occurred within borders of a nation-state were inviolable under laws of national sovereignty ( UN Charter, 1945 ). Yet, since the end of the Cold War, 95% of all major conflicts have been internal nation-state wars, raising grave concern in the world community that the UN Charter is outmoded and fails to adequately address war provoked by political conflicts in sovereign nation-states. Indeed, no legal document exists that will undeniably enforce outside protection of nationstate innocent lives. (Burkle, 1999) . By the end of the 20 th century more people were killed by their own country than from cross border forces. Unfortunately, human rights and international law abuses by sovereign nations against their citizens have led to unthinkable ethnic cleansing and genocide, terms that largely characterize war at the beginning of the 21 st century. These internal armed conflicts, otherwise commonly referred to as complex emergencies (CEs) or complex political disasters (Toole, Waldman, & Zwi, 2001; Zwi & Uglade, 1991) are now the most common human-induced disaster. CEs are further defined as \"situations affecting large civilian popu-",

Studies performed over the last 20 years of evolving complex emergencies in Africa, Asia, Middle East, and Eastern Europe have suggested that at least three distinct epidemiological models exist: developing country (e.g., primarily seen in Africa and Asian countries such as Somali, Angola, Rwanda, East Timor), chronic or smoldering country (e.g., Sudan, Haiti, Israel-Palestine), and developed country (e.g., Former Yugoslavia, Iraq, Macedonia, Kosovo). These epidemiologically described models are helpful in illustrating to policy level decision-makers the impact of conflict on civilian populations and public health infrastructure, but are also useful in planning for humanitarian interventions if and when they occur. Non-governmental aid organizations and UN agencies usually have, by legal mandate, an ongoing presence in crisis prone countries. These interventions are often designed to mitigate the severe consequences on the most vulnerable populations (women, children, elderly, disabled). If a wider assistance intervention occurs, it takes the form of a larger multi-sectoral, multidisciplinary, and multinational humanitarian model of intervention under UN Security Council Resolution political authority.",

A PEM induced state of immunodeficiency is to blame for the frequent complications of secondary infections that account for the majority of deaths. High case fatality rates occur from simple childhood diseases such as measles, upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, and vaccine preventable diseases. Mortality and morbidity rates from measles can be greatly improved with the emergency use of low cost measles vaccine and Vitamin A supplements (Burkle, 1999; Burkholder & Toole, 1995; Toole et al., 2001) .

In the prolonged violence that has plagued Iraq since the beginning of the 2003 war, insecurity and social disorder have accounted for failure to return function to clinical and public health facilities. Only a semblance of a national surveillance system exists, preventing confirmation as to the status of a pre-war gradual rise in malaria, leishmaniasis, tuberculosis (TB), and cholera cases (Burkle & Noji, 2004) . A 2004 UN and Iraq Ministry of Health rapid nutrition assessment study confined to Baghdad showed that 7.7% of children under the age of five were suffering from acute malnutrition, compared to 2002's figure of 4% (Office of the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs, 2004). In 2005, higher than expected cost of protecting workers against insurgents attacks (about 25 cents of every reconstruction dollar now pays for security) has severely limited original plans for public health utility infrastructure repair, and rising security costs led to budget cuts by occupying forces for crucial water treatment plants, sewage networks, and power grids.",

Developed countries possess internal levels of SC in the form of economic resources, human capital, infrastructural investments, and scientific capability (Price- Smith & Daly, 2004) . Such countries have had success in responding to epidemics such as SARS and HIV/AIDS. Countries in crisis, especially developing ones, have low SC levels primarily due to poor governance, which leads to decline in public health capacity. Zimbabwe is cited as an example where HIV/AIDS, in particular, has destabilized the government by exacting an increasingly larger toll on the country's economic productivity, political capacity, its life expectancy, and capacity of the police and military security forces (Price- Smith & Daly, 2004) . Declining SC can open a failing nation-state to internal violence. The term 'health security' has historical basis in CEs, the threat of bioterrorism, and newly emerging and re-emergent diseases. All have in common the threat to destroy a significant proportion of the population. Infectious disease, in particular, may in fact contribute to societal destabilization and to chronic low-intensity internal violence, and in extreme cases, it may accelerate the processes that lead to state failure (Fourie & Schonteich, 2001 , Price-Smith, 1999 .

Most of the problems with infectivity in densely crowded settings such as refugee camps and cities arise through contamination of the environment by permanent excretors, such as livestock and humans, in particular young children who defecate everywhere and anywhere, and generate an inexhaustible reservoir for contamination of the soil, water, and urban dwellings (Toole et al., 2001) .

Infectious disease terminology referring to 'regional' or 'tropical' diseases no longer has basis in fact. Using a political-ecology framework, studies have examined the relationship between the geographies of exile and refugee movements and the associated implications for newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. This research examined four main themes: examination of the geography of the refugee crisis, disruption of health services, breeding of disease in refugee camps, and creation of an optimal environment for emergence and spread of disease due to the chaotic nature of war and violence. Researchers concluded that once an infectious disease is out in the public, rapid diffusion, despite political boundaries, is likely. Secondly, they concluded that there is great potential for more virulent diseases than cholera, dysentery, Ebola and others endemically known to emerge (Kalipeni & Oppong, 1998) . Additional human behavior changes brought about by 'poverty, war, population growth, migration, and urban decay' contribute to the emergence of viral and rickettsial diseases (Smith, 2001) . For example dengue, often the result of vectors inhabiting standing water in uncollected urban trash, has emerged as a unique economic indicator of decaying urban infrastructure, prompting closer scrutiny by economists and public health authorities alike (Economist Editorial, 1998) .",

News of these 'infectious diseases without boundaries' is focused on avian influenza (H5N1) which is not a new disease but an old one that is undergoing antigenic shifts to new subtypes that is highly pathogenic among poultry. The natural asymptomatic carrier, it appears, is the waterfowl (aquatic ducks and geese) with capacity to transmit this virus to other migratory birds, chickens, pigs, domestic cats, tigers, and leopards (H5N1 is 100% fatal to chickens). Viruses infect the respiratory and intestinal tracts of birds and then shed in respiratory secretions and feces. Human infections are extremely uncommon and usually associated with direct contact with sick poultry outbreaks occurring on small-scale and backyard farms.

In a matter of a few years, RNA/DNA microarray diagnostic chips will allow rapid real time accurate diagnosis of infectious agents from available bodily fluids having unprecedented impact on how medical and public health care is practiced worldwide. However, anything so powerful as this technology should face scrutiny for the potential it has to be a military weapon or political tool. This statement is not farfetched. A New York Times editorial blasted scientists for publishing the full genome findings of the 1918 influenza virus on the Internet in the GenBank database, claiming that the genome is essentially the design of a weapon of mass destruction far worse than an atomic bomb (Kurzweil & Joy, 2005) . This article prompted a debate on fear-mongering versus need for even more scientific censorship (New York Times, 2005) . Clearly, public health must take precedence over politics. Such advanced technology has the opportunity to disrupt inequities in both surveillance and response, ensuring in many situations that endemic disease will indeed remain endemic. However, with a pattern, over two decades of increasing political interference and influence on public health (Burkle, 2002; Kaufmann, Meltzer, & Schmid, 2000) there remains a strong risk that this technology will be misused.",

Countries must now report any disease outbreak of \"international concern.\" Moreover, through International Health Regulations (IHR), WHO now has authority to coordinate response to any infectious disease that is a threat to international public health. These roles apply to both accidental and deliberate outbreaks allowing WHO to verify outbreaks based on any available \"official or non-official information\" (Heymann & Rodier, 2004) and attempts to maximize security against the international spread of disease with minimum interference to sovereignty, travel and trade\" (Merianos & Peiris, 2005) .",
