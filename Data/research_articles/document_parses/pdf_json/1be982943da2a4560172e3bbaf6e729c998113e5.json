A subgroup of patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and plasmablast responses could reach >30% of circulating B cells. However, another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable to uninfected subjects. Stable versus dynamic immunological signatures were identified and linked to trajectories of disease severity change.",

The case fatality rate can be as high as ~10% (1) . Some severe COVID-19 patients display an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), reflecting severe respiratory damage. In acute respiratory viral infections, pathology can be mediated by the virus directly, by an overaggressive immune response, or both (2) (3) (4) .

Furthermore, neutralizing antibodies can control SARS-CoV2 infection in vitro and in vivo (4, 26, 27) .

However, neutralizing antibodies are also detected in patients with severe COVID-19 disease (28) , a phenomenon also observed in SARS infection (29) .

We first focused on the major lymphocyte populations. B cell frequencies were comparable to RD or HD subjects (Figure 1D, 1E) . In contrast, the vast majority of COVID-19 patients had lower frequencies of CD8 T cells compared to HD, with similar though less pronounced decreases in CD4 T cells ( Figure 1E) . Indeed, examining only CD3 + T cells, there was preferential loss of CD8 T cells compared to CD4 T cells (Figure 1F and S1C); this pattern was also reflected in the absolute counts that showed lower CD8 T cell numbers compared to CD4 T cell numbers ( Figure S1D) . Despite an apparent greater loss of CD8 compared to CD4 T cells, the frequency of these two lymphocyte populations correlated in the majority of patients ( Figure 1G ). These findings are consistent with previous reports of lymphopenia during COVID-19 disease (16) (17) (18) (19) but highlight a preferential impact on CD8 T cells. As a result of the decrease in T cells, the relative frequency of non-B and non-T cells in the PBMC was elevated ( Figure 1E ). These major alterations in lymphocyte compartments were not observed in RD compared to HD.",

There was a significant increase in the frequency of KI67 + and also HLA-DR + CD38 + non-na\u00efve CD8 T cells in COVID-19 patients compared to HD or RD (Figure 2E, 2F) . In COVID-19 patients, KI67 expression was increased compared to HD and RD across all subsets of non-na\u00efve CD8 T cells, including in populations that are typically more quiescent, such as CM, and even in EM1, which were significantly decreased in frequency ( Figure S2B) . These data indicate broad T cell activation, potentially driven by bystander activation and/or homeostatic proliferation in addition to the antigen-driven activation of virus-specific CD8 T cells. This activation phenotype was confirmed by HLA-DR and CD38 co-expression that was significantly increased across many CD8 T cell subsets (Figure 2F and S2C) . However, for both KI67 + and CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 T cells, there was a diverse range of responses in this cohort. Although the frequency of KI67 + CD8 T cells correlated with the frequency of CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 T cells (Figure S2D) , only ~60% of patients had KI67 + CD8 T cells above the level found in HD, with a similar pattern found for CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 T cells (Figure 2E, 2F) . This activation state of CD8 T cells based on CD38 + HLA-DR + , but not KI67 + , was elevated in COVID-19 patients who had concomitant infection with another microbe (Figure S2E ), but was not impacted by pre-existing immunosuppression ( Figure S2F ) or treatment with steroids ( Figure S2G) . Moreover, these changes in CD8 T cell subsets in COVID-19 patients did not show obvious correlations with individual metrics of clinical disease such as ferritin, hsCRP, or D-dimer ( Figure S2H) . Thus, although robust CD8 T cell activation was a clear characteristic of many hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a substantial fraction of patients had little evidence of CD8 T cell activation in the blood compared to controls.",

            "text": "However, activated cTfh were statistically increased in the COVID-19 group, though this effect appeared to be driven by a subgroup of patients ( Figure 3B) , suggesting ongoing germinal center responses in at least some patients. It is worth noting that activated cTfh frequencies were also higher in RD compared to HD (Figure 3B) , perhaps reflecting residual effects of COVID-19 infection in that group. Frequencies of KI67 + or CD38 + HLA-DR + non-na\u00efve CD4 T cells were increased in COVID-19 patients (Figure 3C, 3E) ; however this expression was not equivalent across all CD4 T cell subsets. The most substantial increases in both KI67 and HLA-DR/CD38 co-expression were found in the effector memory populations (EM, EM2, EM3) and in cTfh, whereas CM populations had moderate increases (Figure S3A, S3B) . Although some subjects had increased activation of EMRA, this was less pronounced. In contrast, PD1 expression was increased in EMRA and all other non-na\u00efve populations compared to HD or RD ( Figure S3C ). Co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR by non-na\u00efve CD4 T cells correlated with KI67 expression by non-na\u00efve CD4 T cells ( Figure S3D) . Moreover, the frequency of total nonna\u00efve CD4 T cells that were CD38 + HLA-DR + correlated with the frequency of activated cTfh ( Figure S3E ). In general, the activation of CD4 T cells was correlated with the activation of CD8 T cells (Figure 3D, 3F) . However, whereas ~2/3 (45/71) of patients had KI67 + non-na\u00efve CD4 or CD8 T cells, ~1/3 had no increase in KI67 in CD4 or CD8 T cells above the baseline of that observed in HD ( Figure 3D, 3F) . Moreover, although most patients fell close to the diagonal with similar activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells, there was a subgroup of patients that appeared to have disproportionate activation of CD4 T cells compared to CD8 T cells, an observation found for both KI67 + and CD38 + HLA-DR + (Figures 3D, 3F) . CD38 + HLA-DR + non-na\u00efve CD4 T cell frequencies were higher in patients with coinfection, but this was not true for KI67 + nonna\u00efve CD4 T cells ( Figure S3F) . Immunosuppression or treatment with steroids did not impact CD4 T cell activation (Figure S3G, S3H ). There were also minimal associations between changes in CD4 T cell populations and clinical parameters, with the exception of EM2, which was positively correlated with D-dimer ( Figure S3I ). Together, these data highlight T cell activation in COVID-19 patients similar to what has been observed in other acute infections or vaccinations (36, 38, 39) , but also identify patients with high, low, or essentially no T cell response based on KI67 + or CD38 + HLA-DR + compared to control subjects.",

HD and RD were similar, though not identical, in tSNE space ( Figure   3G ). In COVID-19 infection, there was notable increase in density in tSNE regions that mapped to expression of CD38, HLA-DR, PD1, CD39, KI67, and CD95 ( Figure 3G ), similar to CD8 T cells. An area on the tSNE map of increased representation for COVID-19 patients also included a central region of low CD45RA, but intermediate to high CD27 where low CD95 expression was also apparent ( Figure 3G ). To gain more insight into these CD4 T cell changes we took a similar FlowSOM clustering approach as with CD8 T cells ( Figure 3H ) and similarly compared expression of sixteen major CD4 T cell markers to delineate the populations identified in each cluster ( Figure 3I ). This analysis identified an increase in Cluster 3 and 4 cells in COVID-19 patients compared to HD and RD controls, both of which represent a CD45RA -CCR7 + CD27 + CM-like CD4 T cell population, where Cluster 3 in particular had increased expression of activation markers including HLA-DR, CD38, PD1, KI67, CD95, and ICOS. This increased activation phenotype was also reflected in the increase in Cluster 6 in COVID-19 patients, which was CD45RA -CCR7 -CD27 + , but also expressed activation markers suggesting an activated, proliferating EM1 population. In line with Figure 3B , Cluster 1, representing CD45RA + CCR7 + CD27 + naive cells, was decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls.",

To investigate the potential connection of inflammatory pathways to T cell responses, we performed 31-plex Luminex analysis on plasma and paired supernatants of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated PBMC from a subset of COVID-19 patients and HD controls. In line with the heterogeneity observed in immune cell populations, we found multiple patterns of chemokines and cytokines in plasma from COVID-19 patients ( Figure S4A) . A subset of COVID-19 patients had CXCL10 concentrations that were 6-8-fold higher than HD controls, whereas a second group showed more moderate increase ( Figure S4B) . A similar pattern was observed for CXCL9, CCL2, and ILRA. In contrast, chemokines involved in the recruitment of eosinophils (eotaxin) or activated T cells (CCL5) were decreased in plasma from COVID-19 patients. IL-6 was not elevated in this group of patients, in contrast to the subset of individuals tested clinically (Figure S1D ), potentially because IL-6 is only measured in the hospital when systemic cytokine elevation is suspected. Following stimulation in vitro, T cells from COVID-19 patients produced cytokines such as IFN-\u03d2, TNF, GM-CSF, IL-2, and others ( Figure S4C ). High concentrations of CXCL9 and CXCL10 were detected in some patients, likely due to T cell-produced IFN-\u03d2 (Figure S4C,   S4D ). In addition, elevated CCL2 was detected in culture supernatants suggesting a potential role for T cell stimulation driving recruitment of myeloid cells. Indeed, the concentrations of CXCL10 and CCL2 were correlated between the matched supernatant from stimulated PBMC and plasma samples ( Figure S4E ). Taken together, these data support the notion that a subgroup of COVID-19 patients have elevated systemic cytokines and chemokines and suggest a possible relationship between T cell stimulation and myeloid recruiting chemokines. and not-class-switched (IgD + CD27 + ) memory B cells were significantly reduced ( Figure 4A) .",

In some cases, PB represented >30% of circulating B cells, similar to what has been observed in acute Ebola or Dengue virus infections (41, 42) . However, these PB responses were only observed in ~2/3 of patients, with the remaining patients displaying PB frequencies similar to HD and RD ( Figure 4B ). KI67 expression was markedly elevated in all B cell subpopulations (na\u00efve, switched memory and not-switched memory B cell, and PB populations) in COVID-19 patients compared to either control group ( Figure 4C) . This observation suggests a role for either a direct response to infection (i.e. antigen-driven) or lymphopenia-driven proliferation (i.e. of the na\u00efve B cells). In contrast, PD1 expression was only significantly higher on PB in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, although there was a wide range of expression, particularly by not-switched and switched memory B cells ( Figure S5A) . Higher KI67 and PD1 in PB may reflect the recent generation of these PB in the COVID-19 patients compared to the small number of PB detected in HD or RD. CXCR5 expression was also reduced on all four major B cell subsets in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 4D ). Loss of CXCR5 was not specific to B cells, however, as expression was also decreased on non-na\u00efve CD4 T cells ( Figure 4E) . Changes in the B cell subsets were not associated with coinfection ( Figure S5B ), immune suppression ( Figure S5C ), or treatment with steroids ( Figure S5D) . Furthermore, there were limited associations with clinical features of severe disease (Figure S5E) , suggesting that the B cell response phenotype of COVID-19 disease was not simply due to systemic inflammation.",

One further possibility was that these PB responses were unrelated to SARS-CoV2 infection, driven perhaps instead by inflammation. However, using a previously reported assay (43) , 86% of patients who made PB responses also were positive for antibodies (IgM; 76% for IgG) against the SARS-CoV2 spike protein receptor binding domain ( Figure 4H, 4I) .

The expression of KI67 and CD95 in these CD27 + CD38 + CD138 + PB ( Figure 4J ) could suggest recent generation and/or emigration from germinal centers. We next asked whether there were different groups of COVID-19 patients (or HD and RD) with global differences in the B cell response. We used Earth Movers Distance (EMD) to calculate similarities between the probability distributions within the tSNE map ( Figure   4J ) and clustered so that individuals with the most similar distributions grouped together ( Figure   4K ). The majority of COVID-19 patients fell into two distinct clusters (EMD Clusters 1 and 3, Figure 4L ), suggesting that there were two major \"immunotypes\" of the B cell response in these patients. The remainder of the COVID-19 patients (~25-30%) clustered with the majority of the HD and all of the RD controls, supporting the observation that some individuals had limited evidence of response to infection in their B cell compartment. To identify the population differences between these three EMD clusters, we performed FlowSOM clustering on the tSNE map, then projected each individual EMD cluster onto this map ( Figure 4M, 4N Whether all of these changes in the B cell compartment are due to direct antiviral responses is unclear. However, the vast majority of hospitalized patients seroconverted and made SARS-CoV2 spike-specific antibodies, indicating that at least some of this activity is antigen-specific.",

We observed considerable stability of the tSNE distributions between d0 and d7 in CD8 T cell, CD4 T cell, and B cell populations, particularly for key regions of interest. For CD8 T cells, the lower region of the t-SNE map associated with activation markers was enriched in COVID-19 patients compared to HD at d0 (Figure 2) , and this was preserved at d7 ( Figure 5A) .

Focusing first on T cell responses, temporal changes were limited on a population level. For example, in CD8 T cells, there was only a significant change in the frequencies of EM2 ( Figure S6A ) and KI67 + non-na\u00efve ( Figure However, in all cases, these temporal patterns were complex, with frequencies of subpopulations in individual patients appearing to increase, decrease, or stay the same over time. To quantify these inter-patient changes, we used a previously described data set (44) to define the stability of populations of interest in healthy individuals over time. We then used the range of this variation over time to identify COVID-19 patients with changes in immune cell subpopulations beyond that expected over time in healthy subjects (see methods). Using this approach, ~60% of patients had an increase in HLA-DR + CD38 + non-naive CD4 T cells over time, whereas in ~24% of patients these cells were stable and in ~16% they decreased ( Figure   5E ). For KI67 + non-na\u00efve CD8 T cells, there were no individuals in which the response decreased. Instead, this proliferative CD8 T cell response stayed stable (~60%) or increased (~40%; Figure S6B ). Notably, for those patients in the stable category, the frequencies of KI67 + non-na\u00efve CD8 T cells were typically almost 5-fold higher than for HD and RD subjects ( Figure   S6B ), suggesting a sustained CD8 T cell proliferative response to infection. A similar pattern was observed for HLA-DR + CD38 + non-na\u00efve CD8 (Figure S6C) , where only ~8% of patients had a decrease in this population, while ~48% were stable and ~44% increased. The high and even increasing activated or proliferating CD8 and CD4 T cell responses over ~1 week during acute viral infection contrast with the sharp peak of KI67 in CD8 and CD4 T cells during acute viral infections including smallpox vaccination with live vaccinia virus (45) , yellow fever vaccine YFV-17D(46), acute influenza virus infection (47) and acute HIV infection (34) . PB responses were similar ( Figure 5F ), with 42% patients displaying sustained PB responses over one week, at high levels (over 10% of B cells) in many cases. Thus, there were dynamic changes in key lymphocyte subsets over time during COVID-19 disease ( Figure S6D) . Clearly, some patients displayed dynamic changes in T cell or B cell activation over 1 week in the hospital, but there were also other patients who remained stable. In the latter case, some patients remained stable without clear activation of key immune populations whereas others sustained T and or B cell activation or numerical perturbation.",

First separating patients into those who had increasing, stable, or decreasing populations of activated CD4 or CD8 T cells or PB from d0 to d7, we then investigated whether changes in these lymphocyte populations correlated with changes in clinical variables over time ( Figure 5G) . These analyses revealed distinct patterns of correlation between changes in immune cell populations and clinical metrics of disease. For example, increasing KI67 + CD8 T cells over time correlated inversely with disease severity at d7, whereas stable KI67 + in CD8 T cells was associated with worse disease. Conversely, stable PB over time correlated with worse disease score at d7, whereas PB going down over time correlated inversely with APACHE III score (a measure of multiorgan failure; Figure 5G ). Moreover, 100% of patients who had decreasing CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 T cells from d0 to d7 were treated with early vasoactive medication, inhaled nitric oxide or early steroids, whereas it was rare for a patient with stable or increasing CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 T cells to have these clinical criteria ( Figure 5H ). In contrast, vasoactive medication, inhaled nitric oxide, and early steroid treatment were equally common in patients with increasing or decreasing PB ( Figure 5H) . However, hyperlipidemia was present in 100% of patients whose PB responses decreased, but was found in <50% of patients who had increasing PB responses over time ( Figure 5H) . We observed similar patterns in other T cell populations with respect to these categorical clinical data ( Figure   S6E ). Thus, the trajectory of change in the T and B cell response in COVID-19 patients was strongly connected to clinical metrics of disease.",

We then asked how changes in T and B cell populations defined above on d0 were related to disease severity. More severe disease was associated with lower frequencies of CD8 and CD4 T cells, with a greater effect on CD8 T cells in less severe disease and with a compensatory increase in non-T non-B cells ( Figure 6B ). Examining individual CD8 T cell subsets, COVID-19 patients displayed trends towards an increase in activated (CD38 + HLA-DR + ), and proliferating (KI67 + ) CD8 T cells in patients with more severe disease, but these differences were not significant ( Figure S7A) . Similarly, the effects on CD4 T cells and B cells were mixed, although activated (CD38 + HLA-DR + ) CD4 T cells were increased with more severe disease (Figure S7B, S7C ).",

First, there was These approaches provided insight into potential immune phenotypes associated with patients with severe disease and poor disease trajectories, but suffer from the use of a small number of manually selected T or B cell subsets or phenotypes. We therefore next developed an unbiased approach, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), to distill the ~200 flow cytometry features representing the immune landscape of COVID-19 disease into two dimensional space, creating compact meta features (or Components) that could then be correlated with clinical outcomes. This analysis revealed a clear trajectory from HD to COVID-19 patients ( Figure 6D ). Because the origin and coordinate orientation of a two-dimensional UMAP projection are arbitrary, we centered and aligned the disease trajectory with the horizontal axis (\"Component 1\") to facilitate downstream analysis ( Figure 6E ). This repositioning also created an orthogonal, vertical axis coordinate (\"Component 2\") that did not align with severity but captured non-overlapping aspects of the immune landscape. We next calculated the mean of Component 1 for each patient group, with COVID-19 patients separated by severity ( Figure   6E ). The contribution of Component 1 clearly increased in a stepwise manner with increasing disease severity, where HD had the lowest mean and patients with the most severe COVID-19 disease had the highest mean ( Figure 6F) . Interestingly, RD were subtly positioned between HD and COVID-19 patients.",

Indeed, UMAP Component 1 correlated with immune features that were themselves strongly correlated with disease severity, most notably CD4 T cell activation (Figure 6G , 6H, S8, S9). In contrast, Component 2 showed enrichment of multiple features of CD8 T cells including EM and EMRA subsets and some activation (Figure 6I , S10, S11). This dichotomy was consistent with some separation of CD4 and CD8 T cell activation in Figure 6C . Examining Thus, 3 patient immunotypes appear to exist in COVID-19 disease ( Figure 6K ): Immunotype 1 with CD4 T cell activation and proliferation and T-bet + PB captured by UMAP Component 1 and related to disease severity; Immunotype 2 with CD8 T cell EM and EMRA subsets, some CD8 T cell activation and CD138 + and KI67+ PB responses captured by UMAP Component 2. UMAP component 2 was independent of disease severity score but correlated with pre-existing immunosuppression, AB+ blood type, and potentially mortality.

Furthermore, blood PB frequencies are typically correlated with blood activated cTfh responses (39) . However, in COVID-19 patients, this relationship between PB and activated cTfh was weak. The lack of relationship between these two cell types in this disease could be due to T cell-independent B cell responses, lack of activated cTfh in peripheral blood at this time point, or lower CXCR5 expression observed across lymphocyte populations, making it more difficult to identify cTfh. Indeed, activated (CD38 + HLA-DR + ) CD4 T cells could play a role in providing B cell help, perhaps as part of an extrafollicular response, but such a connection was also not robust in the current data.

This T and B activation was interesting considering clinical lymphopenia in many patients. This lymphopenia, however, was preferential for CD8 T cells with a lesser effect on CD4 T cells and almost no impact on B cells. It may be notable that such focal lymphopenia preferentially affecting CD8 T cells is also a feature of acute Ebola infection of macaques and is associated with CD95 expression and severe disease (52) . Nevertheless, the magnitude of the KI67 + or CD38 + HLA-DR + CD8 and CD4 T cell responses in COVID-19 patients was similar in magnitude to other acute viral infections or live attenuated vaccines in humans (45) (46) (47) . However, during many acute viral infections, the periods of peak CD8 or CD4 T cell responses in peripheral blood, as well as the window of time when PB are detectable, are relatively short (42, 53, 54) . The stability of CD8 and CD4 T cell activation and PB responses during COVID-19 disease suggests a prolonged period of peak immune responses at the time of hospitalization or perhaps a failure to appropriately downregulate lymphocyte responses in some patients. These ideas would fit with an overaggressive immune response and/or \"cytokine storm\" (2) . Indeed, in some patients, we found elevated serum cytokines and that stimulation of T cells in vitro provoked cytokines and chemokines capable of activating and recruiting myeloid cells. Thus, it is possible that prolonged T cell activation in a subset of COVID-19 patients is connected to dysregulated inflammation, recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells, and perpetuation of organ damage. A key question will be how to identify these patients for selected immune regulatory treatment while avoiding treating patients with already weak T and B cell responses.",

Using correlative analyses, we observed relationships between features of the different immunotypes, patient comorbidities, and clinical features of COVID-19 disease. By integrating ~200 immune features with extensive clinical data, disease severity scores, and temporal changes, we were able to build an integrated computational model that connected patient immune response phenotype to disease severity. Moreover, this UMAP embedding approach allowed us to connect these integrated immune signatures back to specific clinically measurable features of disease. The integrated immune signatures captured by Components 1 and 2 in this UMAP model provided independent validation of immunotypes 1 and 2. These analyses suggested that immunotype 1, comprised of robust CD4 T cell activation with moderate CD8 T cell and T-bet + PB involvement, was connected to more severe disease whereas immunotype 2, characterized by CD8 T cell subsets, memory B cell responses, and PB, was better captured by UMAP Component 2. Immunotype 3, in which little to no detectable lymphocyte response was observed, may represent >30% of COVID-19 patients and is a potentially important scenario to consider. This UMAP integrated modeling approach could be improved in the future with additional data on other immune cell types and/or comprehensive data for circulating inflammatory mediators for all patients. Nevertheless, these findings provoke the idea of the tailoring clinical treatments or future immune-based clinical trials to patients whose immunotype suggests greater potential benefit.",

The temporal patterns of the response also matter. A delay in initiating an effective immune response, for example due to viral immune evasion, can lead to viral spread and then extensive tissue damage by an otherwise appropriate immune response attempting to control the infection. Our data suggest that the immune response of hospitalized COVID-19 patients may fall across this spectrum of immune response patterns, presenting as distinct immunotypes linked to clinical features, disease severity, and temporal changes in response and pathogenesis. This study provides a resource of a large compendium of immune response data and also an integrated framework as a \"map\" for connecting immune features to disease. By localizing patients on an immune topology map built on this dataset, we can begin to infer which types of therapeutic interventions may be most useful in specific patients.",

Second, these binary comparisons (e.g. one immune subset versus one disease or clinical feature) vastly underutilized the high dimensional immunological and clinical information in this dataset. Thus, we next visualized major T and B cell subpopulation data as it related to clinical disease severity score (Figure 6C, S7A-C). Data were clustered based on immune features and then overlaid with the disease severity score over time for each patient. This analysis revealed groups of patients with similar composite immune signatures of T and B cell populations (Figure 6C). For example, groups of patients were apparent with high CD4 T cell activation and proliferation (group 4), versus patients with robust PB but less T cell activation (group 1). Two middle groups were enriched in EM subpopulations and KI67+ CD8 T cells (group 2) or CM and relatively low CD4 T cell activation (group 3). When individual CD8 T cell, CD4 T cell or B cell populations were examined, a similar concept emerged (Figure S7A-C). Although the pattern for patient grouping for CD8 T cells was perhaps less obvious than for CD4 T cells and B cells, patients with activated and proliferating CD8 T cells as well as EMRA separated from patients with less CD8 T cell activation (Figure S7A). For CD4 T cells, a group of patients with robust activation and proliferation contrasted with a second group with minimal CD4 T cell activation (Figure S7B) and B cells separated patients into those with robust versus minimal PB responses (Figure S7C). These data suggest the idea of \"immunotypes\" of COVID-19 patients based integrated responses of T and B cells, though some individual cell types and/or phenotypes separated patients more clearly than others.",

Given the association of the UMAP Components with patient immunotypes, we next asked how these components correlated with clinical features. In line with the segregation of immune features, Components 1 and 2 showed distinct association patterns. Whereas Component 1 correlated with several clinical measurements of inflammation, coinfection, organ failure, and acute kidney disease(Figure 6J), Component 2 correlated instead with pre-existing immunosuppression and mortality(Figure 6J), though mortality should be interpreted with caution given the small number of observed deaths (n=5) in the dataset.",

Nevertheless, nonhospitalized subjects who recovered from COVID-19 had evidence of T cell memory to the virus(50). SARS-CoV2 specific antibodies are also found in convalescent subjects and patients are currently being treated with convalescent plasma therapy(28,51). However, COVID-19 ICU patients have SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies(28), raising the question of why patients with these antibody responses are not controlling disease. In general, these studies report on singlepatients or small cohorts and, as such, comprehensive deep immune profiling of a large number of COVID-19 hospitalized patients does not yet exist. Such knowledge would address the critical question of whether there is a common profile of immune dysfunction in critically ill patients. Such data would also help guide testing of therapeutics to enhance, inhibit, or otherwise appropriately tailor the immune response in COVID-19 patients. To interrogate the immune response patterns of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, we studied a large cohort of 70+ COVID-19 patients. We used high dimensional flow cytometry to perform deep immune profiling of individual B and T cell populations, with temporal analysis of immune changes during infection, and combined this profiling with extensive clinical data to understand the relationships between immune responses to SARS-CoV2 and disease severity. Using this approach, we made several key findings. First, a defining feature of COVID-19 disease in hospitalized patients was the heterogeneity of the immune response. Many COVID-19 patients displayed robust CD8 T cell and/or CD4 T cell activation and proliferation, though a considerable subgroup of patients (~1/3) had no detectable response compared to controls. B cell responses were also heterogeneous and, in some patients, PB responses were >30% of B cells whereas, in other patients, PB were undetectable above controls. These observations suggest multiple ways that COVID-19 disease can manifest immunologically. Furthermore, even within those patients who mounted detectable B and T cell responses during COVID-19 disease, the immune characteristics of this response were heterogeneous. By deep immune profiling, we identified three immunotypes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients including: (i) patients with robust activation and proliferation of CD4 T cells, together with modest activation of CD8 T cells and a signature of T-bet + PB; (ii) an immunotype characterized by CD8 T cell EM and EMRA subsets, modest CD8 T cell activation, T-bet + memory B cells and CD138+ PB; and",

Resulting viSNE maps were fed into the FlowSOM clustering algorithm(56). For each cell subset, a new self-organizing map (SOM) was generated using hierarchical consensus clustering on the tSNE axes. For each SOM, 100 clusters and 10 metaclusters were identified. To group individuals based on B cell landscape, pairwise Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) value was calculated on the B cell tSNE axes for all COVID-19 day 0 patients, healthy donors, and recovered donors using the emdist package in R as previously described(57).
