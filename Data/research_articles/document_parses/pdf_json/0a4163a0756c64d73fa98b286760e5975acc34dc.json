To gain an understanding of the evolution of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2, we herein analyzed the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host. We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes. Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above.

SARS-COV-2 is an RNA virus with an expected mutation rate similar to other RNA viruses, as discussed above. This mutation rate is usually much higher than the corresponding one of any human host. Therefore, as discussed in a recent paper [43] , any antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 would exert an intense selective pressure on the virus. This may result in highly adaptive and treatment-resistant virus types with enhanced pathogenicity. It should also be taken into consideration that the virus will create a systemic inflammatory response with detrimental effects in the host organism, i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a form of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with major inflammatory injury to the lung cells and extravasation of protein-rich edema fluid into the airspace [44, 45] . Low dose radiation (<0.5 Gy) has been shown to have indeed, in some cases, anti-inflammatory effects and to modulate the immune response, and has even been suggested for treating pneumonia [46] . This LDIR exposure is not expected to exert significant selective pressure on the new coronavirus. Therefore, and based also on recent suggestions, one can hypothesize that a low dose treatment of 30 to 100 cGy to the lungs of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia could ameliorate the inflammation significantly and relieve the life-threatening systemic symptoms of the infection [47] .

Negative x values indicate flexibility to respond to global pressure to change DNA sequence (virtual time axis) in order to prevent recombination, and to thus allow species divergence (i.e., generate SARS-CoV-2). When recombination is still possible, then two diverging genomes in the same cell will blend, so militating against protein differentiation would occur in time, corresponding to positive x values.

Then the sequences were selected according to their geographical distributions, isolation dates and host species.In this study, we explored 30 CoV genomes: 28 viruses from Woo et al. (2010) [4] ; the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We downloaded the coding sequences of these coronaviruses from the National Center for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) (available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/).
