Our study identified the AFI etiology in over half (55%) of participants and most were infected with one of nine viral pathogens. This detection frequency was higher than that of other recent prospective AFI studies that tested for multiple pathogens (55% versus 36-41%) [9] [10] [11] [12] 15] . This difference may in part be explained by the greater contribution of chikungunya in our study than in the other studies that tested for this pathogen [9, 10, 17] . However, unlike other studies, we were unable to detect any evidence of disease caused by Rickettsia or Coxiella spp., which made up 4-13% of all AFIs in other studies [10] [11] [12] [13] ; and unlike other areas, malaria [9, [11] [12] [13] 18] and typhoid fever [9, 10, 12, 13, 15] were not part of our diagnostic algorithm as they are only occasionally detected among travelers returning to Puerto Rico. While DENV was not as commonly identified as CHIKV or FLU A/B, participants with dengue were more likely to be admitted to the hospital at enrollment. The proportion of AFI cases with dengue in our study was comparable to other recent studies which found 4-9% of AFI cases had dengue [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [17] [18] . One exception to this was a study that found 34% of AFI patients had dengue; however, the study's eligibility criteria likely enhanced enrollment of dengue cases [14] . In our study, dengue incidence varied by age group with a nearly a 10-fold difference between participants <5 years old and 10-19 years old (3% versus 27%), which may be due to differences in likelihood of seeking medical care in primary versus secondary DENV infections [35] . Of note, 6% of participants !65 years old had dengue as a cause of AFI, a finding comparable to a Puerto Rico study in which 5% of 17,666 laboratory-positive dengue cases detected by surveillance were !65 years old [36] . In contrast, other recent prospective studies Chikungunya, the most commonly identified AFI overall, was least likely to result in hospital admission, although two male participants with CHIKV infection died. These cases were older individuals (>75 years old) who had underlying co-morbidities which may have complicated their clinical course. Nonetheless, since autopsy was not performed for either case, ascertaining whether CHIKV infection played a role in either fatality is difficult. However, in our study chikungunya was disproportionally identified among older participants, with positivity increasing from <10% of pre-school aged children to about one-third of participants !50 years old. This pattern of disease has been seen in other areas with recent CHIKV emergence [18] , and may be due to older individuals having an increased likelihood of complications due to preexisting co-morbidities [44, 45] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 465, "end": 468, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 469, "end": 473, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 474, "end": 478, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 479, "end": 483, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 484, "end": 487, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 643, "end": 646, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 647, "end": 650, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 651, "end": 654, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 825, "end": 829, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 830, "end": 834, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 835, "end": 839, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 879, "end": 882, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 883, "end": 887, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 888, "end": 892, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 893, "end": 897, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 898, "end": 901, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 920, "end": 923, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 924, "end": 927, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 928, "end": 931, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 932, "end": 935, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 936, "end": 939, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1350, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1355, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1360, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1365, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1370, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1375, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1380, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1385, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1390, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1555, "end": 1559, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1837, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2841, "end": 2845, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2966, "end": 2970, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2971, "end": 2974, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Co-infections confirmed by molecular assays were detected among 1% of our participants, most commonly involving enteroviral or ORV infections; less than one-third of all co-infections included a DENV or CHIKV infection. Another recent prospective study found that 1% of AFI participants had co-infections involving molecularly diagnosed dengue or influenza, malaria, and positive blood culture [9] . Interestingly, we did not detect any co-infections involving CHIKV and DENV. An analysis of island-wide surveillance data from Puerto Rico during the same time period found only one CHIKV/DENV co-infection among approximately 1,000 specimens tested by RT-PCR for both DENV and CHIKV [46] . These findings are consistent with another prospective AFI study conducted in Sri Lanka [17] . Although a recent study has shown that Aedes aegypti can be infected with as many as three arboviruses simultaneously and can likely transmit these viruses to humans [47] , the frequency of co-or tri-infection of mosquitoes in the wild depends upon the geographic spread and degree of circulation of each virus. During our study, DENV transmission decreased significantly before CHIKV transmission peaked, making co-infections less likely. In addition, in Puerto Rico, where Aedes aegypti is the sole vector for CHIKV and DENV, viral interaction and viral Prospective study of acute febrile illness in Puerto Rico interference within the mosquito may reduce the likelihood of co-infection [48] [49] [50] . However, RT-PCR positive DENV/CHIKV co-infections have been documented at higher rates in five countries [51] . We identified differences in clinical predictors of laboratory-positive dengue by timing of presentation and age group highlighting the importance of considering these factors when developing prediction algorithms for clinical management [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . We found, as have others [61] , that even early (<3 DPO) in the clinical course leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are predictive of dengue across all age groups, and thrombocytopenia strengthened as a predictor over time. In our study, headache and eye pain were the only \"aches and pains\" that were predictive of dengue for all age groups [62] . Eye pain was a predictor early and later in the clinical course, a finding consistent with pediatric [63] and adult [56] prospective cohort studies, as well as a surveillance study conducted in Puerto Rico [52] . We also found that rash among children <5 years old presenting early and erythema on the face and/or neck in all age groups presenting 3-5 DPO, were positive predictors of dengue. While the presence of skin rash has been found to be a predictor of dengue in several prospective studies [61] , few studies have evaluated erythema as a predictor [18, 64, 65] . Last, like other prospective studies [56, 66] , we found that nausea is an early predictor for dengue. We were also able to show that adults aged 20-49 years presenting 3-5 DPO were more likely to have abdominal pain than those with other AFIs, and dengue cases of all ages presenting 3-5 DPO were also more likely to have diarrhea and poor circulation in addition to nausea, findings that lend support to the idea that warning signs for severe dengue develop after the early phase of the illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 394, "end": 397, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 683, "end": 687, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 778, "end": 782, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1478, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1479, "end": 1483, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1488, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1600, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1845, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1850, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1860, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1865, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1866, "end": 1870, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1875, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1880, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1881, "end": 1885, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1917, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2230, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2334, "end": 2338, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2353, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2443, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2732, "end": 2736, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2790, "end": 2794, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2795, "end": 2798, "text": "64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2799, "end": 2802, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2842, "end": 2846, "text": "[56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2847, "end": 2850, "text": "66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study, which enrolled all patients presenting with fever regardless of age, sex, or clinical characteristics, may be limited in generalizability.
