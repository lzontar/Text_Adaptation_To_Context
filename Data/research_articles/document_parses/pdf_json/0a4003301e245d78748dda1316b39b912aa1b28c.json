PARV4 does not resemble any other known mammalian parvoviruses and probably will be classified as the sole member of a new parvovirus genus. At the same time, a second novel human parvovirus was discovered in pooled respiratory samples [2] .

Thus, the prevalence, epidemiology, transmission routes, and clinical associations of PARV4 remain undetermined. On the basis of the observation of relatively short-lived viremia and the development of a strong immune response that conferred protection from reinfection, B19 infections have been considered to be acute and spontaneously resolving. However, more recent evidence from tissue biopsy specimens and autopsy samples has indicated frequent persistent infection in previously exposed individuals [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , even though infection is controlled effectively by the immune system to the extent that persistent viremia is infrequent and has an invariably low titer among seropositive individuals [20] [21] [22] . The combination of long-term persistence and immunity from reinfection has been shown to create a so-called bioportfolio in which B19 and possibly other persistent DNA viruses, such as AAVs, that are encountered early in life may be preserved lifelong, thus constituting a record of virus variants that had circulated several decades previously [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 88, "end": 91, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 92, "end": 95, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 96, "end": 99, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 100, "end": 103, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 104, "end": 107, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 108, "end": 111, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 112, "end": 115, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 116, "end": 120, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 121, "end": 125, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 126, "end": 130, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 333, "end": 336, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 926, "end": 930, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 931, "end": 935, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 941, "end": 945, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 946, "end": 950, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 951, "end": 955, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1146, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1151, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1156, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1508, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In the current study, we examined a series of samples of different tissues, collected at autopsy, for the presence of HBoV and PARV4 DNA sequences and compared the frequencies of detection, viral loads, and genetic variability with those for B19.

If PARV4 infection is associated with needle sharing or HIV infection (as discussed in the previous subsection), then the time scale for this succession would be substantially more recent than that for B19.

No sequence variation was observed in the 13 genotype 1 sequences of 114 bp. The recently described high rates of sequence change in B19 and canine parvovirus [41, 42] can be used to infer maximum time since divergence for these variants, based on the assumption that substitution rates at synonymous sites in the viral nonstructural regions are similar between different genera of Parvoviridae. By application of the observed mean substitution rate of substitutions \u03ea4 1.8 \u03eb 10 per site per year (95th percentile range, to 3.0 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 \u03ea5 7.5 \u03eb 10 substitutions) [41] , the PARV4 variants that infected the study subjects, as well as the individual in whom PARV4 was originally discovered, would have diverged within the last 14 years (range, 8-34 years) before death. This prediction indicates a very recent introduction and rapid dissemination of PARV4 infection in the HIV/IDU risk groups in Edinburgh in the 1980s-1990s. In contrast, the same calculation applied to B19 genotype 1 variants from the study subjects (mean pairwise distance, 0.47%) predicted an earlier average divergence time of 52 years, which is remarkably consistent with the observed replacement of B19 genotype 2 by genotype 1 in the 1960s (figure 2) [25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 297, "end": 301, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 302, "end": 305, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 701, "end": 705, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1367, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Molecular epidemiology of B19 and PARV4 infections."}, {"text": "Rapid turnover and changes in transmission dynamics of genetic variants of B19 and PARV4 revealed by these new models of parvovirus evolution may apply more broadly to other members of Parvoviridae.

As an intriguing alternative to the hypothesis that HBoV was not detected in autopsy samples because infections were nonpersistent (see above), the genetic data support the possibility that HBoV also might have spread to Scotland very recently and was not circulating during the childhood years of the study subjects (1930s-1970s) , when HBoV infection usually seems to be acquired.
