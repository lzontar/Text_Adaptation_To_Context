While minimizing the number of variables is a recurring theme in descriptive complexity, our interest in the study of k-WL-invariance has an additional motivation: If we know that a graph parameter \u03c0 is k-WL-invariant, this gives us information not only about \u03c0 but also about k-WL. For example, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix has WL dimension 1 (see [24] ), and the whole spectrum of a graph has WL dimension 2 (see [8, 13] ), which implies that 2-WL subsumes distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs by spectral methods.",

It follows from the known immersion of FPC into the finite-variable infinitary counting logic C \u03c9 \u221e\u03c9 = \u221e k=2 C k \u221e\u03c9 (see [21] ), that each such \u03c0 f is k-WLinvariant for some k.

We begin in Sect. 2 with introducing a concept of equivalence between two linear programs L 1 and L 2 ensuring that equivalent L 1 and L 2 have equal optimum values. Next, in Sect. 3, we consider the standard optimization versions of Set Packing and Hitting Set [14, SP4 and SP8] , two of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. These two generic problems generalize F -Packing and Dominating Set respectively. Their fractional versions have thoroughly been studied in hypergraph theory [12, 20] . We observe that the LP relaxations of Set Packing (or Hitting Set) are equivalent whenever the incidence graphs of the input set systems are 1-WL-equivalent. This general fact readily implies Rubalcaba's result [23] on the 1-WL-invariance of the fractional domination number and also shows that, if the pattern graph F has vertices, then the fractional F -packing number \u03c0 F f is k-WL-invariant for some k < 2 . This bound for k comes from a logical definition of the instance of Set Packing corresponding to F -Packing in terms of an input graph G (see Corollary 6) . Though the bound is quite decent, it does not need to be optimal. We elaborate on a more precise bound, where we need to use additional combinatorial arguments even in the case of the fractional matching. We present a detailed treatment of the fractional matching in this exposition (Theorem 4), while the proof of our general result on the fractional F -packing numbers (Theorem 5), which includes the aforementioned cases of F = K 3 , P 3 , is postponed to the full version of the paper [2] .",

This results in an LP-based algorithm for approximation of \u03b3(G) within a logarithmic factor, which is essentially optimal as \u03b3(G) is hard to approximate within a sublogarithmic factor assuming NP = P [22] . As shown by Rubalcaba [23] , \u03b3 f is 1-WL-invariant. Along with the Lov\u00e1sz bound, this implies that the 1-WL-invariance ratio of \u03b3 is at most logarithmic. On the other hand, Chappell et al. [6] have shown that the logarithmic upper bound for the integrality gap of \u03b3 f is tight up to a constant factor. In Sect. 6 we prove an \u03a9(log n) lower bound even for the 1-WL-invariance ratio of \u03b3 over n-vertex graphs. This implies the integrality gap lower bound [6] , reproving it from a different perspective. In Sect. 6 we also discuss the additive integrality gap of the fractional edge-disjoint triangle packing. [3] have shown that the 1-WL-invariance ratio for the vertex cover number \u03c4 is at most 2. Alternatively, this bound also follows from the 1-WL-invariance of \u03bd f (which implies the 1-WL-invariance of \u03c4 f as \u03c4 f = \u03bd f by LP duality) combined with a standard rounding argument. The approach of [3] uses a different argument, which alone does not yield 1-WLinvariance of the fractional vertex cover \u03c4 f .",

Our approach to proving Theorem 4 was, given an instance graph G of Fractional Matching Problem, to define an instance S G of Fractional Set Packing Problem having the same LP value. The following definition concerns many similar situations. Given a correspondence G \u2192 S G , we say that an istance S G of Fractional Set Packing is definable over a graph G with excess e if G \u2261 (1+e)-WL H implies I(S G ) \u2261 1-WL I(S H ). This definition includes a particular situation when I(S G ) is first-order interpretable in G in the sense of [11, Chapter 12.3] , which means that for the color predicates (to be red or blue respectively) as well as for the adjacency relation of I(S G ) we have first order formulas defining them on V (G) k for some k in terms of the adjacency relation of G. The number k is called width of the interpretation. In this case, if there is a first-order sentence over s variables that is true on I(S G ) but false on I(S H ), then there is a first-order sentence over sk variables that is true on G but false on H. Cai, F\u00fcrer, and Immerman [5] showed that two structures are \u2261 k-WL -equivalent iff they are equivalent in the (k + 1)-variable counting logic C k+1 .

Given a graph G, let T (G) denote the family of all sets {e 1 , e 2 , e 3 } consisting of the edges of a triangle subgraph in G. We regard T (G) as a family S G of subsets of the edge set E(G). The optimum value of Set Packing Problem on S G , which we denote by \u03c1 K3 (G), is equal to the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in G. Let \u03c1 K3 f (G) = \u03bd f (S G ) be the corresponding fractional parameter. Moreover, the 2-WL-equivalence of G and H implies that |C G (t)| = |C H (t )| for any t \u2208 T (G) and t \u2208 T (H) with c G (t) = c H (t ). This allows us to identify T (G) and T (H) so that c G (t) = c H (t) for every t in T (G) = T (H). As in the proof of Theorem 4, it suffices to argue that {C G (w)} w\u2208E(G)\u222aT (G) is a common equitable partition of the incidence graphs I(S G ) and I(S H ).

Therefore, \u03b3(G)/\u03b3(H) \u2265 1 5 ln d, which readily gives us the desired bound. We conclude with a discussion of Edge-Disjoint Triangle Packing.

On the other hand, Yuster [26] showed that \u03c1 K3 f (G) \u2212 \u03c1 K3 (G) = \u03a9(n 1.5 ) for infinitely many G, and it is open whether this lower bound is tight. Define the invariance discrepancy of \u03c1 K3 as the function D K3 (n) = max |\u03c1 K3 (G) \u2212 \u03c1 K3 (H)| where the maximum is taken over 2-WLequivalent n-vertex graphs G and H. As follows from Theorem 7, this function provides a lower bound for the maximum integrality gap \u03c1 K3 f (G) \u2212 \u03c1 K3 (G) over n-vertex graphs. In this respect, it is reasonable to ask what the asymptotics of D K3 (n) is. The following fact is a step towards this goal. Proof. Consider G = tS and H = tR, where S and R are the Shrikhande and 4 \u00d7 4 rook's graphs respectively. Both have vertex set Z 4 \u00d7 Z 4 , and (i, j) and (i , j ) are adjacent in S if (i = i and j = j + 1) or (j = j and i = i + 1) or (i = i +1 and j = j + 1), where equality is in Z 4 , while they are adjacent in R if i = i (row 4-clique) or j = j (column 4-clique). S is completely decomposable into edge-triangles {(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i + 1, j + 1)} and, hence, \u03c1 K3 (S) = 16. On the other hand, in R the edges of each K 3 all belong to the same row or column 4-clique. Since a packing can take at most one K 3 from each row/column K 4 , we have \u03c1 K3 (R) = 8. This yields \u03c1 K3 (G) \u2212 \u03c1 K3 (H) = 8t as desired.",
