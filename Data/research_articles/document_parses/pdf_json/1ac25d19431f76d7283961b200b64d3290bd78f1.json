In October 2005 and May 2006, the female gave birth to 2 cubs each delivery, which 3-4 weeks later showed signs of enteritis and died. In October 2006, she gave birth to a single cub, which died of severe hemorrhagic enteritis at 4 weeks of age. The cub exhibited anorexia, depression, and mild dehydration, but it was not moved away from the mother for ethologic and management reasons. In the subsequent days, the cub's general condition appeared to worsen; anorexia and more marked depression were reported by the animal caretakers. Therefore, on day 3 after illness onset, the cub was taken to the zoo's animal hospital. Examination showed a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C, hemorrhagic enteritis, tenesmus, and deep sensorial depression. Hydration and antimicrobial therapy were immediately started, but after 24 hours the animal was agonal and hypothermic and was therefore euthanized. At necropsy, severe hemorrhagic enteritis, hemorrhage in the intestinal lymph nodes, and marked dehydration were observed. Histologic examination showed marked alteration of the intestinal mucosa: erosions, villi depletion, and hemorrhagic infi ltration.",

To determine the sequence and genome organization of the novel calicivirus, a 3.4-kb region at the 3\u2032 end of the genome was amplifi ed by RT-PCR as described by Wang et al. (7) . The sequence of the 3\u2032 end of open reading frame (ORF)1, the full-length ORF2, ORF3, and the noncoding region through the poly-A tail was determined (GenBank accession no. EF450827). A 14-nt overlap was present in the ORF1-ORF2 junction region, as it is in most human and animal NoVs. The ORF2 was 1,737 nt long and contained an ORF encoding a capsid protein with a predicted size of 578 aa. By BLAST and FASTA analysis, the highest sequence match was found to genogroup IV NoVs (69.3-70.1% aa identity), and identity to non-GIV NoVs was \u226452.6% aa. A total of 23 aa insertions, scattered throughout the P2 domain, were present in the capsid protein of the lion NoV when compared with human genogroup IV NoVs. A 1-nt overlap was found between ORF2 and ORF3, and a 106-nt long nontranslated *University of Bari, Valenzano, Bari, Italy; \u2020Giardino Zoologico di Pistoia, Pistoia, Italy; \u2021University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy; \u00a7Baranya County Institute of State Public Health Service, P\u00e9cs, Hungary; and \u00b6National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, the Netherlands region was found between ORF3 and the poly-A tail. ORF3 was 765 nt long and encoded for a 254-aa polypeptide. The nucleotide identity plot of the genome of the lion NoV (from the 3\u2032 end of ORF1 to the poly-A tail) was compared with the human genogroup IV.1 NoV, Fort Lauderdale/560/98/ US (AF414426) (Figure 1) . A phylogenic tree was constructed by using the capsid protein of a selection of human and animal NoVs of the various NoV genogroups (I to V) (7, 8) .

Human NoVs are classifi ed into genogroups I, II, and IV. In addition, NoVs classifi ed in genogroups II and III have been detected in pigs and cows (7, 11, 12) , and NoVs proposed as genogroup V have been detected in mice (13) (Table) . However, to our knowledge, NoVs have not been detected in other animal species and our report is the fi rst description of NoVs in felids.",
