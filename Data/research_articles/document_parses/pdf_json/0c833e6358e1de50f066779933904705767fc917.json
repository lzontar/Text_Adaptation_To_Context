Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR.

It is important to note that despite the trend of increasing platelets, the platelet count only extended above the normal range (>450x10 9 /L) in 24 of 135 COVIDpos patients with serial measurements, and the development of such outright thrombocytosis was observed with similar frequencies in the thrombotic and non-thrombotic cohorts. Further, the fact that several patients with elevated fibrinogen (i.e. >400 mg/dL) at presentation did not develop thromboses suggests that early hyperfibrinogenemia is not a singular driver of subsequent clotting events, but a small sample size (n = 10 patients; 9 non-thrombotic vs. 1 thrombotic) limited the power of this analysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "Despite these uncertainties, this linking of longitudinal trends to patient outcomes provides several useful pieces of clinical information, including but not limited to: (1) Early hyperfibrinogenemia is to be expected in COVID-19 patients and may not be useful in determining an appropriate thromboprophylaxis approach for a given patient.

While elevations in fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported (and confirmed by our analyses), the circulating levels of tissue factor and other coagulation factors have not been assessed broadly in this population. Interestingly, single cell RNA-sequencing data highlights that the respiratory tract, including the nasal cavity, are strongly enriched for high expression of tissue factor (encoded by the gene F3) (Figure 6A) . Specifically, F3 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of these tissues -the same cell types which have been found to express ACE2, the putative entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Figures 6B-C) . Type II pneumocytes, which may also express ACE2 and have been reported as a putative entry site for SARS-CoV-2 [12] [13] [14] , are also strongly enriched among all human cell types showing high F3 expression ( Figure 6A) . Whether infection-related damage to these epithelial cells may lead to shedding of tissue factor into circulation or its increased exposure circulating coagulation factors locally in respiratory tissues would be interesting to evaluate. Such a mechanism could at least partially contribute to the development of clots systemically and locally in the pulmonary vasculature.

Specifically, we found that monocytes, basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils followed this temporal trend (Figures 1D-G) .
