The donors in this study exhibited significant up-regulation of IFN-\u2425 during the acute viremic phase (i.e., before IgM seroconversion) and after IgM seroconversion, compared with median plasma levels in IFN-\u2425 in control specimens (table 2 and figure 1B) . Also, IFN-\u2423 levels in donor specimens were higher than those in control specimens only before IgM seroconversion, which is indicative of an early period of IFN-mediated proinflammation and antiviral host immunity. The similar expression patterns of upregulated TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2425 in infected blood donors was not surprising, given their linkage as proinflammatory mediators and roles in the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis [3, 9 -11] . Concomitant increases of IL-4 in plasma samples obtained before and after IgM seroconversion was unexpected because humoral immune responses in specimens obtained before IgM seroconversion are not detectable by commercial serology kits ( figure 1B) . IL-4 has recently been associated with immunogenic responses in a WNV subunit vaccine study [12] . IL-4 may therefore function in an immunoregulatory role during acute infection, to counterbalance proinflammatory T cell-mediated immune responses and support early humoral adaptive immunity.

We did not observe a similar decrease in CXCL9 levels following IgM seroconversion, although CXCL10 and CXCL9 share the same receptor (CXCR3). Disparate regulation of CXCL10 and CXCL9 has been noted in studies of herpes simplex virus type 1 and the agent of SARS, suggesting that CXCL10 and CXCL9 play nonredundant roles in acute viral infection [13, 14] . CXCL10 is a potent chemoattractant for activated Th1 lymphocytes (adaptive immunity) and natural killer cells (innate immunity), whereas CCL2 is a monocyte and basophile chemoattractant (innate immunity). Therefore, CXCL10 and CCL2 are important host response mediators, with CXCL10 in particular thought to play a role in the temporal development of innate and adaptive immunity in concert with IFNs. In murine models of WNV infection, CXCL10 has been shown to play a neuroprotective role [15] ; however, recent results have argued that early CXCL10 expression (preceding IFN-\u2425) and other chemokines may trigger inflammation and neuropathological conditions [9] .
