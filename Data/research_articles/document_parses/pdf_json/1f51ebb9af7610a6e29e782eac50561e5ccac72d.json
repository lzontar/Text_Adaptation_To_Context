First, we provide an overview of caring for ourselves and resilience in uncertain times. Next, we discuss empathy and compassion and explain why emotion regulation (\"self-other\" distinction) is an essential self-care strategy that nurses must learn so they can sustain care for others. Next, we explain how the practice of self-compassion can safeguard mental J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f How do you talk to yourself when you are having a difficult time or have made a mistake?",

Studies show harsh self-talk and self-criticism activates the sympathetic nervous system that stimulates the stress response, so is harmful to our mental health and wellbeing . As nurses, we understand the importance of self-care strategies (e.g., adequate sleep, healthy eating, regular exercise, social connections, mindfulness) to foster our resilience (Mills, et al, 2018; Cusack, et al., 2016) . Another important self-care strategy is kind self-talk which is a component of self-compassion (Neff, 2011) . We must first practice selfcompassion and be aware of our own needs, before we can help others with theirs (Vachon, 2016) .",

Control is vital for our wellbeing, but our plans and sense of normality are being threatened and disrupted by forces beyond our control. Resilience starts with self-awareness, understanding how you are being affected by the uncertainty, powerlessness and difficult events. Fear, anxiety, anger, sadness and grief are normal feelings in the current crisis. We need to acknowledge our feelings of vulnerability, grief and worry, rather than telling ourselves we shouldn\"t have those feelings because other people are worse off (Berinato, 2020) . \"When we are no longer able to change J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f \uf0b7 Caring touch such as placing your hand over your heart when feeling upset releases oxytocin that makes us feel safe and connected (Neff, 2011) .",
