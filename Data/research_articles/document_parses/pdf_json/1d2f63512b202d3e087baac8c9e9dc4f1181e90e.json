Clinical features of in early reports included fever, myalgia, dry cough, dysphonia, fatigue, lymphopenia and radiological evidence of multifocal peripheral ground-glass lung opacities. About 15% of COVID-19 cases progressed to acute respiratory distress syndromes and multi-organ failure [5] . Extrapulmonary manifestations included diarrhea, anosmia, dysgeusia, meningoencephalitis, thromboembolism and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children. Despite sharing some clinical manifestations with that of SARS, a large proportion of COVID-19 cases were mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, which may contribute to the high transmissibility of COVID-19 [6, 7] .",

Both cell types could be infected by the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and were suggested to play a role in viral pathogenesis [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and these two sentinel cell types is currently unknown. In this study, we found that moDCs and MDMs were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and in vivo settings [38] [39] [40] [41] . A recent study similarly suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was highly sensitive to IFN treatment [42] . In this regard, the deficiency of SARS-CoV-2-infected moDCs and MDMs in launching effective IFN response might delay viral clearance and contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. The treatment of COVID-19 by interferon may jump start and improve the antiviral response of the host to achieve better clinical outcome [43] .",

In particular, substantial cell-cell fusion was detected in SARS-CoV-2-infected moDCs (Figure 1). Next, we further evaluated the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in moDCs and MDMs with SARS-CoV included for comparison. As demonstrated inFigure 2, the virus titer in the supernatants and virus genome copy in the cell lysates did not increase over the 72 hours interval in both SARS-CoV-2-infected moDCs (Figure 2A)and MDMs (Figure 2B), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection of moDCs and MDMs were abortive.

To investigate whether infection of SARS-CoV-2 induce cell death in moDCs and MDMs, we evaluated cell viability upon virus infection by the CellTiterGlo assays. As demonstrated inFigure 2C, SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in a modest reduction in viability (10-20%) in the infected moDCs between 24 to 72 hours post inoculation, which was not statistically significant due to sizable donor-to-donor variability. The viability of MDMs was largely unaffected upon SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection (Figure 2C). Overall, our result demonstrated that moDCs and MDMs were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Both cell types supported viral protein production but did not efficiently support virus replication and generation of infectious virus progenies.SARS-CoV-2 infection modulated the expression of entry-related host factors in moDCs and MDMsTo dissect the reason behind the inefficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in moDCs and MDMs, we next assessed the endogenous expression of host factors that are potentially involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, which included angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), FURIN, and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN).

Intriguingly, in SARS-CoV-2but not SARS-CoV-infected MDMs, the expression of IFN-type-I (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) and IFN-type-III (IFN\u03bb1) was even lower than that of the mock-infected MDMs at 24 hours post infection (Figure 4). In parallel, our data suggested that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was not substantially triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in moDCs. Specifically, among the eight representative cytokine/chemokine evaluated, SARS-CoV-2 only significantly upregulated the expression of IP10 (3.3-fold, p = 0.015) (Figure 5A). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 significantly activated the expression of five of the eight (5/8 or 62.5%) evaluated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine in MDMs, including that of TNF\u03b1, IL8, IP10, MIP1\u03b1, and IL1\u03b2. The most upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine in MDMs by SARS-CoV-2 infection was again IP10 (7.0-fold, p = 0.003) (Figure 5B).Collectively, these findings demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not activate IFN-type-I, -II, or -III response in moDCs and MDMs. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 triggered significant pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expressions in the infected MDMs, the pro-inflammatory response in moDCs upon SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely absent.",

To this end, we evaluated the protein expression level of STAT1 and examined the efficiency of STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN\u03b1 treatment with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated STAT1 protein expression in moDCs (Figure 6A). We next evaluated the activation of STAT1 by measuring the ratio of phosphorylated STAT1 over STAT1 based on the intensity of individual bands. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that while IFN\u03b1 treatment substantially activated STAT1 phosphorylation, the extent of upregulation was significantly mitigated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in moDCs (Figure 6B). Importantly, while SARS-CoV also inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation in moDCs, the extent of inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 was significantly stronger than that by SARS-CoV (p = 0.035). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not have a modulatory effect on STAT1 phosphorylation in MDMs (Figure 6B). Taken together, our results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection subverted interferon signaling in moDCs through antagonizing STAT1 phosphorylation.",

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulated the ACE2 expression in both infected moDCs and MDMs. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 did not upregulate any IFN response in both cell types and only triggered significant pro-inflammatory response in the infected MDMs but not moDCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the largely silent infection of SARS-CoV-2 in moDCs was associated with viral antagonism of STAT1 phosphorylation. Overall, our study contributed to our understanding on the role of dendritic cells and macrophages in COVID-19 biology. Importantly, despite efficient viral protein production, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not activate type-I (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2), -II (IFN\u03b3), or -III (IFN\u03bb1) IFN response in moDCs and MDMs. The attenuated host IFN response is consistent with our previous findings from SARS-CoV-2-infected ex vivo human lung tissues [21] as well as a 37].

Interestingly, despite a lack of IFN response, SARS-CoV-2 triggered potent expression of pro-inflammatory mediators including that of TNF\u03b1, IL8, IP10, MIP1\u03b1, and IL1\u03b2 in the infected MDMs. Among them, IP10 was of particular interest as it was the only inflammatory mediator that was upregulated in both moDCs and MDMs upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, excessive IP10 could exacerbate the pathology of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)[52] and was recently suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2[53]. Together, our data suggested that the SARS-CoV-2-infected dendritic cells and macrophages in the lungs of COVID-19 patients might be a source of pro-inflammatory cytokine production that exacerbated the clinical manifestation of COVID-19.Overall, our study provided the first evidence that demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated host responses in primary human dendritic cells and macrophages, which provided novel insights on the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",
