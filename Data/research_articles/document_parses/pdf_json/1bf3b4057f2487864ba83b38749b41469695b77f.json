There is ongoing debate about how long a novel COVID-19 vaccine will really take to advance through trials, achieve regulatory approval across multiple jurisdictions, and be manufactured and distributed at the required scale to impact global immunity and prevent further transmission. Vaccines often present commercial viability challenges due to long, complex development timelines and \"capacity to pay\" issues in developing countries. While some that achieve global population health success, such as the Human Papillomavirus vaccine, can provide substantial return on investment, ix these trends have meant that, compared to novel therapeutics, far fewer vaccines have made it through clinical testing. As a result, regulators and vaccine developers lack experience in vaccine development comparable to novel therapeutics [13] . This could become increasingly problematic if all current COVID-19 clinical and pre-clinical vaccine candidates are simultaneously vying for regulators' attention and resources to expeditiously review clinical protocols and evidence dossiers. Not to mention disruption to other clinical programs as regulators are re-directed to reviewing the clinical protocols of dozens of COVID-19 vaccine candidates and even more therapeutic candidates. Beyond these bottlenecks, the underlying support required within bioanalytical and pathology providers will also be critical to ensuring rapid availability and interpretation of clinical data.",

While some of these trial initiatives have started to emerge, such as the SOLIDARITY trial, they are still few and far between. This is especially problematic considering there are currently over 500 randomized controlled-studies for COVID-19 preventatives and treatments, 31 of which have at least two arms and a target sample size of at least 1,000 patients (some with recruitment targets of 40,000-55,000) [14] . Large, randomized and placebo-controlled studies have been associated with longer total development times, as opposed to smaller, non-randomized single-arm or extension-arm studies [8] . Last, guidance documents for pandemic trials should be available in anticipation of pandemics, ready to be triggered as soon as the WHO declares a public health emergency, and remain in effect after the public health crisis has abated.
