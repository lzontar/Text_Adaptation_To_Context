The PEEP therefore provides the same function as bottle height by preventing alveolar collapse. In ARDS the lungs stiffen increasing alveolar collapse and ventilation/ perfusion mismatch. Think of these patients like our own challenging (collapsible) patients, the hypermetropic eyes with a narrow anterior chamber. Unfortunately, cohesive viscoelastic is not an option in the lung so to keep the alveoli open in the setting of ARDS, the PEEP is increased, often to >10 cmH 2 O, to promote alveolar recruitment and to improve oxygenation [2] .",

In the ventilation of patients with ARDS, gravity will cause the localised collapse of posterior segments of the lung whilst simultaneously shunting blood to these poor oxygenated portions of the lung, increasing V/Q mismatch. Placing patients in Fig. 1 Graph demonstrating airway pressure as a function of time over a single respiratory cycle. Airway pressure increases to peak pressure during inspiration before falling to peak end expirartory pressure at the end of expiration. the prone position is a technique to counter gravity dependant collapse/atelectasis and as for post macular hole surgery patients, longer is better and 16+ hours is advised [3] . Together the Fi02, PEEP and prone positioning are three tools for addressing hypoxia. Prone positioning is increasingly used in treating patients with COVID-19 and therefore, it is likely, our technical skills will be called upon to aid in the complex manoeuvre of placing patients in prone position in the ICU.",

In the context of COVID-19 related lung disease, pressure control may be preferable because the operator is able to limit barotrauma by setting a ceiling pressure on the ventilator. Lung damage is reduced at the expense of lower tidal volumes, MV and therefore reduced CO 2 clearance. Conversely, to increase CO 2 clearance, either the RR or Vt must be increased, however the ARDS.net study showed that smaller tidal volumes, 6-8 ml/kg IBW, improve outcomes despite a higher CO 2 [4] .",
