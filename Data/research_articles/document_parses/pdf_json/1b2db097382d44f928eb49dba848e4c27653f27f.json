The daily trajectory of each user was analysed in order to evaluate the average distance travelled each day by users and the percentage of users who had not moved for 24 hours. The task was made more difficult by the fact that the reported location of smartphones is affected by uncertainty (ranging from a few meters to a few kilometres) and by the fact that a smartphone may be subject to \"ghost\" movements, due to the increase in uncertainty about its position rather than to any real movement. However, techniques such as the Kalman filter allow us to estimate a trajectory faithful to the true trajectory travelled by the smartphone and to understand which smartphones actually moved. Figure 1 shows, for each date, the average distance travelled by users (blue line) and the percentage of users who had not moved within a 24-hour period (orange line). We refer to this latter group as \"% #IStayAtHome\", in reference to the Twitter hashtag widely used by people tweeting in support of the lockdown. Pandemics and exponential growth James J. Cochran explains why a misunderstanding or disregard of exponential growth may have extremely grave consequences D uring his 26 March call into The Sean Hannity Show on Fox News, President Donald Trump questioned whether New York State would actually need the tens of thousands of ventilators its leaders had estimated would be necessary to deal with its expected number of coronavirus cases (bit.ly/3bw0AyZ). Then, three days later, during a briefing at the White House, Trump wondered out loud why the need for protective masks had increased at one New York hospital from 10,000-20,000 per week to 200,000-300,000.",
