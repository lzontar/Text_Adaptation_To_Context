Here we report that homozygosity for the C allele of rs12252 in the interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) gene is associated with more severe disease in an age dependent manner. This supports a role for IFITM3 in disease pathogenesis and the opportunity for early targeted intervention in at risk individuals.",

It has spread rapidly throughout Wuhan to other provinces in China and around the world. As of Feb 29, 2020, a cumulative total of 79,394 COVID-19 cases were reported in China which led to 2,838 deaths according to the Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] . There is an urgent unmet need to understand why some people develop severe disease. Heritable differences are known to modulate individual susceptibility to and severity of infectious disease [2, 3] . We hypothesized that a genetic variant of IFITM3 was associated with the severity of COVID-19, specifically the SNP rs12252. This genetic variant is common in Asian populations and homozygosity for the C allele has been associated with influenza severity [4] . IFITM3 encodes an immune effector protein critical to viral restriction and acts to restrict membrane fusion [5] . It is currently unknown whether IFITM3 shows genetic association with the severity of COVID-19.",

We phenotyped the patients into mild and severe disease groups according to clinical definitions from the National Health Commission of China [1] . Demographic and phenotypic data are shown in Table 1 . Mild disease (n=56) was defined as patients with fever, respiratory symptoms and pneumonia from imaging. Patients with severe disease (n=24) were those who in addition developed significant tachypnoea, hypoxia, respiratory failure or other organ failure. The patient cohort was broadly representative of published clinical reports in the outbreak to date in terms of case mix and severity [6] . We found that blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the patients with severe disease (77% compared to 96.7% in patients with mild disease) (P=0.001) and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) to inspired (FiO2) was 223.5\u00b145.8 mmHg in the severe group compared to the mild group (466.7\u00b1135.6 mmHg) (p<0.001).

Our findings support a hypothesis that host defects in control of intracellular viral replication may result in more prolonged and severe disease. The mechanism of action of this synonymous variant of IFITM3 is still unknown, a truncated version of IFITM3 suggested by earlier work on influenza is unlikely to lead to the differences in viral restriction previously seen [7] . Larger cohort studies are needed to confirm this genetic association with severity of COVID-19, but the data presented here supports the need for such genetic analyses in different global populations, with the opportunity for early targeted intervention in those at risk if robust genetic biomarkers can be established and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.",
