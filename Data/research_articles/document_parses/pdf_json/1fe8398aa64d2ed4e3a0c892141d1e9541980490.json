Children less than 2 years of age have been reported to be at highest risk for hospitalization with seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza infections [7, 8, 9] , and it has been assumed they would also be at highest risk for admission to an intensive care unit. In support of this, a recent pediatric study from Argentina, reported that children less than 4 years were at highest risk for severe disease with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection [7] . In contrast to these reports, however, our study is the first to demonstrate that older hospitalized children with H1N1 were significantly more likely to require intensive care services than hospitalized children less than 2 years of age. The age group 4-5 years formed the largest group with severe 2009 H1N1 infection requiring intensive care services and the median age of hospitalized children was 6 years. This is in contrast to the 2008-2009 seasonal influenza season, where the median patient age was 1.8 years, and the median age of patients admitted to the PICU was 2.2 years. The reasons for the peak age differences in disease severity for 2009 H1N1 are unclear. One possible explanation is that younger children may have a less robust immune response to 2009 H1N1 and, therefore, not develop severe pulmonary disease which may be immune mediated. This would imply that the 2009 H1N1 virus elicits a different or more robust immune response than seasonal influenza. It is possible that the youngest children were thought to be at highest risk for severe disease and were targeted for earlier and more aggressive treatment which may have altered the course of their illness. Our study, however, does not support this hypothesis as almost 85% of children, both less than 2 years and greater than 2 years age, received oseltamivir within 24 hours of admission and there were no differences from time of onset of illness to admission between these two groups. Alternatively, in our community, the epidemic peak occurred approximately 6 weeks after the annual reopening of schools (start date for Denver public schools was August 19) which could have resulted in a larger number of older, school-aged children being exposed resulting in a larger number being infected with 2009 H1N1, some of whom developed severe infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 323, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 324, "end": 326, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 327, "end": 329, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 609, "end": 612, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study found that having an underlying neurologic disorder was a risk factor for admission to the ICU with 2009 H1N1.

We speculate that the high incidence of ARDS in school age children may be related to an excessive immune response mediated by cytokines to this novel strain of influenza.

Therefore, we may have included a very small number of patients who had a falsely positive influenza IA test. Based on our laboratory's experience with other specimens, however, we estimate that at most we may have had 9 false positives, 3% of our total study population. Additionally, we performed a subanalysis on the patients who were only PCR positive, which did not alter any of our findings.
