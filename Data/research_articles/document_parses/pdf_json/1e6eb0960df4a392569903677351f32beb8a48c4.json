According to the family members, the patient had been complaining about dizziness and fatigue throughout the day. Other symptoms, such as coughing, fever, and chest pain, were not present. His medical history (in this case, a heteroanamnesis) states that the ABSTRACT Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global health emergency. At present, patients are the primary source of infection. A randomly diagnosed confirmed case of COVID-19 highlights the importance of computerized tomography of thorax in diagnosing asymptomatic patients. In the early phase of COVID-19, routine screenings miss patients who are virus carriers, and tracking travel history is of paramount importance to early detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 cases.",

[1] [2] [3] In Kosovo, the first two cases were reported on March 13, 2020; as of April 7, there are 184 laboratory-confirmed cases. \ue062e diagnosis was also made by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which is highly specific. \ue062e computerized tomography (CT) has a higher sensitivity but lower specificity and can play a role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. However, multiple radiologists have come forward to state that CT should not be relied on as a primary diagnostic/screening tool for COVID-19. [4] [5] [6] patient suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes mellitus type 2. After consultation with a neurologist, the patient underwent a CT scan of his head and a complete blood test. \ue062e CT scan revealed general cerebral atrophy (corresponding to the patient's age) and discreet gliotic lesions but no changes to the brain parenchyma [ Figure 1 ]. \ue062e radiologist in charge during that shift, taking into consideration the current coronavirus pandemic, ordered a chest CT scan. During the careful analysis of the chest, CT scan the following lesions could be observed: Alveolar changes predominantly, such as ground-glass opacities, focal consolidations, and mixed opacities (including a reversed halo sign), with bilateral and multifocal involvement, peripheral distribution, predominantly in the middle, lower, and posterior lung fields, septal thickening, and reticular changes superimposed on alveolar changes [ Figure 2 ]. Also incipient lung scarring (fibrotic bands) and pleural effusion with ground-glass opacities especially predominated shown in [ Figure 3 ] and mediastinal lymphonodes [ Figure 4 ]. \ue062e blood test results were as follows: Glucose 102 mg/dL (65-110 mg/dL), leukocytes WBC 28000, INR 1.0, fibrinogen 28, LDH 29, procalcitonin 1.3, protein C-reactive PCR 96.6 mg/l (30-120), protein 7.0 g/dL (6.0-8.0 g/dL), sample test positive for COVID-19, neutrophil 6.07 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL 2.00-7.50, lymphocyte 1.65 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL 1.00-4.00, monocytes 0.35 \u00d7 10 3 / \u03bcL 0.10-1.00, eosinophil 0.00 < \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL 0.10-0.40, basophil 0.01 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL 0.00-0.20, erythroblast 0.00 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL, urea 63 > mg/dL (15-50), and creatinine 0.71 mg/dL (0.5-1.3).",

[7] The definitive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) test. It is believed to be highly specific, but its sensitivity has been reported to be as low as 60-70% [8] and as high as 95-97%. [9] False negatives present serious clinical problems, and several negative tests might be required in a single case to be confident about excluding the disease. CT should not be used for COVID-19 screening in asymptomatic patients, but may be considered in hospitalized patients, symptomatic cases, or in specific clinical situations. Tomography findings of COVID-19 pneumonia are non-specific and similar to those of other pulmonary infections, and they vary according to the stage of the onset disease. They must be correlated with clinical and laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection. To date, it is recommended that the final diagnosis of the disease be confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test or genetic sequencing. Clinicians and radiologists should be familiar with the spectrum of COVID-19 involvement and be vigilant to identify and treat affected patients early. Those patients may have few clinical symptoms, chest CT may present normal findings, and even laboratory tests are negative at the beginning. However, the patients discussed in this article presented an inconsistent situation because the patient came to the clinic with atypical clinical changes for COVID-19 and was diagnosed accidentally.",
