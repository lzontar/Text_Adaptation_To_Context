We also 42 found a shift from prioritising vaccine and therapeutic development towards a focus on assessing the 43 effectiveness, risks, benefits and trust in the variety of public health interventions and measures. Our findings 44 also provide insight into temporal nature of these research priorities, highlighting the urgency of research that 45 can only be undertaken within the period of virus transmission, as well as other important research questions 46 but which can be answered outside the transmission period. Both types of studies are key to help combat this 47 pandemic but also importantly to ensure we are better prepared for the future.",

We also 154 identified a range of new priorities relating to addressing COVID-19 in lower resource settings, where multiple 155 pressures including ongoing endemic infectious diseases and other co-morbidities are competing within the 156 health and policy systems for limited resources. priority headings, and this meant that some headings (for example the animal human interface) had relatively survey and this may have influenced the ranking given by respondents.
