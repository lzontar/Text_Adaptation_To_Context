Sites varied considerably in their prior level of experience with the PERCH laboratory methods and therefore required varying levels of assistance and oversight. Assuring that each laboratory had standard equipment in place and was comprehensively trained meant that the initiation of study enrollment and full specimen testing was delayed by weeks to months in some instances. Maintaining a high level of involvement and in-person oversight required regular travel by the laboratory director in addition to frequent communication by phone and email. Additionally, local approvals to ship specimens and isolates for confirmatory testing resulted in long delays in the reference laboratory receiving samples from some sites. Despite these challenges, we were able to achieve the highest methodological standards across a variety of circumstances, and demonstrated the ability to set up very complex molecular diagnostics in challenging environments. Achieving standards was a very positive motivator among laboratory staff, especially in laboratories that had not used international standards before. The value of regular feedback to the staff was evident in our study and we observed laboratory capacity and technical skills improve rapidly over a short period of time, with some of the laboratories without prior similar experience becoming the highest performers. Applying a high level of standardization required considerable effort in the study planning stage and throughout the enrollment and testing period, but in the end this effort was outweighed by our confidence that results were accurate and comparable across sites.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "PERCH was one of the largest pneumonia etiology studies ever undertaken, with a complex testing algorithm applied to >9500 individuals distributed over 9 enrollment centers in 7 different countries.
