Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures.",

If the true size of the epidemic can be estimated, this enables a more reliable assessment of how and when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) should be both introduced, as infections rise, or relaxed as infections fall (3) . Estimates of infection prevalence are also important for obtaining accurate measures of transmission: if the proportion of infections reported declines as the epidemic rises, the number of confirmed cases will grow slower than the actual underlying epidemic. Likewise, if detection rises as the epidemic declines, it may appear that transmission is not declining as fast as it is in reality. Underdetection of cases also makes it challenging to estimate at what stage of the epidemic a particular country is (15) : viewed in isolation, case incidence data could reflect a very large undetected epidemic, or a smaller, better reported epidemic.",

To measure this, we compared our estimates for the proportion of cases detected with the number of tests performed per new case each day, which can provide an indication of testing effort with a country (18) . Taking a moving average with a 7-day window, we found that countries that showed high testing effort did not necessarily have high levels of case ascertainment. For example, in a two-week period in March the United Kingdom performed 80 tests per new case (the mean across Europe during the same period was 27 tests per new case). However, we estimate that also in the UK only between 3-10% of symptomatic cases were being detected ( Figure 1 ). Overall, we found a weak positive correlation between testing effort and case ascertainment (Kendall's correlation coefficient of 0.16). This suggests that increased testing effort can help to improve case ascertainment, but on its own is not enough to guarantee low levels of underascertainment.",

In the absence of serological data, the ratio between cases and deaths, adjusted for delays from confirmation-to-outcome, can be used to derive estimates of the proportion of symptomatic cases reported. Using this approach, we estimated that case ascertainment dropped substantially in many countries during the peak of their first epidemic wave. Although serological surveys are beginning to emerge (22), many countries do not have such data available, or may only have results from a single cross-sectional survey. The methods and estimates presented here can therefore provide an ongoing picture of the underlying epidemics, including local level dynamics as fine-scale surveillance data become available (23, 24) .",

We assumed the age-adjusted baseline CFR was 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2% -1.5%) (4), which is broadly consistent with other published estimates (5,25,26), and we assumed a range of 10% -70% of infections were asymptomatic (22, (27) (28) (29) with a mean value of 50% (13) . Given the uncertainty in these estimates, we propagated the variance in baseline CFR and range in proportion asymptomatic in the inference process so the final 95% credible interval reported for under-ascertainment reflects underlying uncertainty in the model parameters. We also assumed that deaths from COVID-19 are accurately reported. If local testing capacity is limited, or if testing policy affects attribution of deaths (for example, the evidence for the efficacy of post-mortem swabbing is lacking), deaths can be misattributed to a cause other than COVID-19. In that case, our model may underestimate the true burden of infection. Additionally, if a large proportion of transmission is concentrated within specific age groups, the effective CFR may be higher or lower than the assumed baseline; with better age-stratified temporal data on cases and deaths, it would be possible to explore the effect of this in more detail. However, our estimates were in general consistent with published serological data, where available. Further, given that our estimates of under-ascertainment in many countries suggest that the numbers of symptomatic infections at the peak of the outbreak were one or two orders of magnitude larger than reported cases, even if deaths are underreported, our estimates are still likely to be much closer to the true burden than locally reported cases imply. Our estimates of under-ascertainment over time require a time-series of COVID-19 deaths as an input, a data source that may also exhibit reporting variation. One notable example of this was Spain during June 2020 ( Figure S1 ). However, as our Gaussian process model quantifies time-varying case ascertainment, it is able to account for positive or negative spikes in reporting (14) (see the Extended Methods section in the Supplementary Material for more details).",

In the early stages of outbreaks, this method can provide an indication of whether a large proportion of cases are being detected -and hence whether transmission may be containable with targeted measures such as isolation and contact tracing -or whether transmission is more widespread and a more extensive response is required. Such estimates can also provide insights in the later stages of an outbreak, as they can indicate high levels of detection in countries that have achieved control. For example, in Australia, an adapted version of our model estimated that 80% (95% CrI: 55% -100%) of cases had likely been ascertained during the outbreak (24). By adjusting for under-ascertainment, it is also possible to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 internationally. During February and early March 2020, importations of SARS-CoV-2 into the UK came primarily from Italy, Spain and France (30). This is consistent with the inferred progression of infection during this period in our model; we estimated that Italy, Spain, France and Belgium all had over 6.5% of the population infected by 31st March 2020 (30).",

We also estimated that the timing of the peak level of symptomatic cases may be considerably earlier or later than the raw confirmed case curve suggests (Table 1) . Accurate surveillance of an ongoing outbreak is crucial for estimating key epidemiological values such as the reproduction number, and hence evaluating the impact of control measures (21). If reported case numbers do not reflect the shape and magnitude of the underlying epidemic, it may bias estimates of transmission potential and effectiveness of interventions. If levels of under-ascertainment are increasing, early interventions may appear to be more effective than they actually are, which could lead to delays in imposing more stringent measures. Likewise, if ascertainment increases in the declining phase of an epidemic, the effectiveness of interventions may be underestimated, potentially leading to measures remaining in place for longer than they would have been had more accurate data been available.

Table 1 : Comparison between the confirmed and adjusted case numbers at their respective peaks for ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases and ten countries with the highest number of symptomatic cases after adjusting for under-ascertainment. Eight countries are in both lists, so the total is twelve distinct countries. We find that the peak of the case curves shifts when they are adjusted for under-ascertainment. Clearly, Mexico and Brazil haven't necessarily peaked yet, given that they are not as far along their epidemic as the other countries. Therefore, for these countries, we simply report the date and number of the highest number of cases to-date.",
