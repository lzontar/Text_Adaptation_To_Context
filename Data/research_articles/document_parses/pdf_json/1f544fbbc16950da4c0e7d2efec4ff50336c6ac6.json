Accumulation of glutamine within the astrocytes results in cell swelling which leads to a series of events that result in a neuroinhibitory state [5] . \u2022 False Neurotransmitters \u2022 The failing liver results in the production of false neurotransmitters. These molecules may interfere with normal brain functioning and have a net inhibitory effect [6] . \u2022 Amino Acid Imbalance \u2022 Patients with hepatic failure have decreased plasma levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, leucine, and isoleucine while experiencing increased levels of aromatic amino acids (AAA) phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. This is thought to be related to increased muscle catabolism and therefore increased BCAA metabolism as well as decreased breakdown of AAA by the compromised liver.
