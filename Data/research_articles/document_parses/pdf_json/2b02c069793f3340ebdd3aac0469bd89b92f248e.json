We observed that in line with ARDS guidelines [21] , physicians set tidal volume near 6 mL/kg of IBW, PEEP at moderate-high level, used largely prone positioning and paralysis. We observed significant differences in PEEP level, tidal volume and plateau pressure across patients' groups (possibly favored by the limited dispersion of the value), but the clinical significance of these differences are uncertain. Hence, although patients were not randomized, we think that the absence of association between any antiviral treatment and positive outcome (neither at day 14 nor at day 28) deserves consideration.

While the present study was ongoing, several scientific data emerged on the absence of efficacy of antiviral candidates: for HCQ with possible higher rate of cardiac events especially if combined with azithromycin [22, 23] , for L/R in a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) none dedicated to critically ill patients [7] . In parallel, results of US trial dedicated to REM did show a potential benefit on time to recovery but only for patients outside ICU with a mild disease severity [10] . As clinical benefit seems improbable for HCQ, we believe that only the results of ongoing RCTs will determine if REM or L/R have a true effect on outcome, yet we are of the opinion that our data plead to avoid compassionate use of these drugs, following the \"first do not harm\" rule [24, 25] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 110, "end": 114, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1055, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1060, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1065, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1070, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1075, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1080, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1111, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1328, "end": 1332, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1336, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1437, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1602, "end": 1606, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1896, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1900, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Indeed, regarding potential side effects as secondary outcomes, we observed that patients treated by L/R had a higher frequency of renal failure and need for renal replacement therapy. This effect was confirmed after adjustment for potential cofounders associated with a greater risk of renal failure. Several reports in HIV patients indicate that L/R use was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease [26] and acute tubular injury has been described with ritonavir [27] . Renal disease characterized by a proximal tubulopathy have been reported in COVID-19 [28] and have been described as a prognostic factor [29] . We report a high frequency of AKI in our cohort, in line with US data, with 20% of RRT [19] .

To our best knowledge no study dedicated to patient in the ICU analyzed the factors associated with COVID-19 AKI. In our cohort, we observed that besides treatment by L/R, age, gender, BMI, renal and cardiovascular comorbidities were independently associated with AKI. Higher incidence of AKI may then be due either to a previous nephron loss and/or to a specific susceptibility of these patients to SARS-CoV2 through a greater expression of ACE-2 in podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells [31] . Another possible hypothesis is occurrence of hypovolemia related to L/R associated diarrhea and \"dry lung\" strategy promoted for patients with severe ARDS although usual hemodynamic monitoring in participating ICUs did not support this hypothesis. Last, recent report highlights extremely high dosage for patient with COVID-19 receiving L/R as compare to cohort of HIVinfected patients.
