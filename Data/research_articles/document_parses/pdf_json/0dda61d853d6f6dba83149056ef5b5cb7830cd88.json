The intensification of animal husbandry; centralisation of large groups of animals in industrial production units; globalization of trade in live animals and/or animal products, bedding and feeds; as well as increased tourism, are all considerable factors in the threat of devastating infectious diseases word-wide. The opening of borders between many countries such as in the European continent contributes greatly to the highrisk situation, where infectious agents may easily travel thousands of miles and then suddenly appear in areas where they are unexpected and probably even unknown. The sudden and unexpected appearance of any infectious disease in a new region, be it a country or a continent, may lead to a delayed or innaccurate diagnosis resulting in the uncontrolled spread of the disease agent to other susceptible populations of animals over large geographic areas. Recent major examples are incidences of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK, the extension of rinderpest into the Somali plains and Rift Valley fever (RVF) spread into the Arabian Peninsula. The latest major problem is the occurrence, re-occurrence and rapid spread of influenza virus. All these exemplify the serious economic and social impact of the of highly contagious transboundary animal diseases (TADs).",

In considering such situations, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare report (adopted 24-25th April 2003) states, \"Recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), classical swine fever (CSF) and avian influenza (AI) have occurred in several member states and resulted in the slaughter of large numbers of animals as well as severe economic consequences\".

This is clearly illustrated by the northward spread of bluetongue in Europe that reached Scandinavian countires by 2007. African horse sickness virus, a close relative to bluetongue virus in the Orbivirus genus of the Reoviridae family, has shown a similar pattern in spreading toward regions of the world where this disease was previously unknown. The main reason for this is that the insect vectors of the viruses (Culicoides) have extended their range since the climatic conditions have changed favourably.

Despite intensive eradication programmes, these diseases still cause severe problems due to direct or indirect losses in the animal populations; increased treatment costs and decreased production rates. Diseases caused by viruses such as bovine herpesviruses, adenoviruses, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine respiratory syncitial virus and bovine coronaviruses to name a few, are still commonly found in cattle populations all over the world and their eradication remains an important task. Pig populations in most of the world suffer from a high variety of viral diseases. Classical swine fever, African swine fever, Aujeszky's disease, foot-and-mouth disease, swine vesicular disease and other well-known and characterised viral diseases of swine are permanent targets of eradication programmes worldwide, with varying rates of success. For example, classical swine fever has been eliminated from the domestic pig herds of the EU, but wild boar populations are still infected in several countries, posing a high risk, though re-infection, for the whole continent. African swine fever is spreading, as previously indicated and there are no potent vaccines available. New variants of the virus have recently emerged in Africa, while in Sardinia remains infecected. Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS) is a commonly occurring disease caused by an emerging arterivirus, first detected first in 1991 in the Netherlands, after which it rapidly spread all over the world. Other diseases are increasing in importance such as Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) or Porcine Dermatitis and Nephropathy Syndrome (PDNS), were the association with porcine cirvovirus type 2 was found, however, several questions are still unanswered in aetiology, pathogenesis and many other important factors of these diseases of swine.

By performing multiplex PCR, we seek to diagnose all possible pathogens which can be considered to be causing the disease complex. In general the multiplex PCR assays are useful for diagnostic purposes, providing the diagnostician the ability to detect more than one infectious agent(s) in a single assay. The gel-based PCR assays allow the development of multiplex PCR; however, the real-time PCR is even more suitable for multiplexing. The reason is that the individual probes for the component assays can be labelled with different fluorophores, each of which functions as a specific colour reporter dye for one set of primers. Since the fluorescent probes emit at different colour wavelengths, it enables an easy multiplexing of the assays. Compared to the single-target PCR techniques, the construction of multiplex assays can be rather complicated, considering the large number of primers required. The various primers might compete with each other, as they have to be placed in the same reaction mix of the classical nested PCR.",

Realizing the high need for these equipments, the industry is producing a wide range various types of the nucleic acid purifying robots. For example, the GenoVision M48 extraction robots (Biorobot M48 station, Qiagen, Norway), utilize magnetic separation of the target molecules. By comparing the results of nucleic acid preparations of the robot with manual procedures, we found the robot more efficient and reliable. This robot purified the nucleic acids simultaneously from 48 samples, within 2.5 h. The products were clean enough to be amplified directly in the PCR. In addition to high speed, robustness and low labour-input, a further advantage of the robots is the reduced risk of cross contamination between specimens. By the introduction of special tools laboratory practices and internal controls (mimics) it was possible to reduce the danger of false positivity and false negativity rather soon in the history of the diagnostic PCR. The closed and automated systems of the robots provide strong safety for the PCR-based diagnostic assays. It is advisable to automate as many steps as possible in the diagnostic procedures. By simultaneously using nucleic acid extraction and pipetting robots with the real-time PCR machines, the laboratory can establish an automated diagnostic chain. Such chains have been established at our laboratory for the detection of several viruses. By the introduction of robots, high throughput and robust diagnostic assays have been established, with reduced manipulation requirement, less contamination risk and a very rapid diagnosis time, which is shortened from hours to minutes.

The experiences of the last decade indicate that the PCR techniques will eventually supersede many of the classical direct methods of infectious agent detection. It is clear that the PCR is replacing virus isolation or bacteria cultivation for the detection of agents that are difficult or impossible to culture. There are several reasons for this trend, including that virus isolation requires, i) the presence of replicating viruses; ii) expensive cell culture and maintenance facilities; iii) as long as several weeks to complete the diagnosis; and iv) special expertise, which is missing or diminishing today in many laboratories. Although PCR assays were initially expensive and cumbersome to use, they have now become relatively inexpensive, safe and user-friendly tools in diagnostic laboratories. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR is generally greater than isolation or capture ELISA procedures.\"",

This method is based on the Primer-Probe Energy Transfer (PriProET) principle and is targeting the 3D gene of the virus. The assay was validated for the efficacy to detect all the seven known FMDV serotypes. The test method was linear over a range of at least seven orders of magnitude and the detection limit was below the equivalent of 10 genomic copies of the virus. Analysing recent African probang samples the method was able to detect FMDV in materials from both cattle and buffalo. When compared to traditional virus cultivation, the virus detection sensitivity was similar but the PriProET method can provide a laboratory result much faster than virus cultivation. Thus, a complex diagnosis of a foot-and-mouth-disease outbreak can be accomplished within several hours, providing a powerful new tool for the animal health authorities.",

The application of padlock probes for detection of pathogens is a very recent trend in molecular diagnosis. Padlock probes are circularizable oligonucleotides useful for highly multiplex genetic studies. These probes have the capacity to detect simultaneously thousands of different target sequences in a single multiplex array system. Each viral nucleic acid serves as template for a padlock probe equipped with a unique sequence (tag) associated to that specific target. Circularized probes are amplified with a single universal primer pair and the fluorescently labelled products are then sorted, using the tag sequences, on a microarray. The assay principle is straightforward comprising a few internally controlled reaction steps in a single vessel. Run-times were comparable to real-time PCR, but with the benefit that the presence of several viruses and their various serotypes can be analyzed within the same reaction. Although the cost for oligonucleotides and array slides is higher than that for conventional PCR assays, it is reduced in proportion to the number of assays made. In this format, multiplex detection using padlock probes and microarrays could have implications in more effective screening for viruses causing similar vesicular symptoms and in turn facilitate rapid counteractions, especially in case of FMD outbreaks.",

Previously the disease cases were observed in connection to travelling, recently zoonotic transmission is also suspected, i.e., a direct route of infection, from animals to humans. For the improved detection of the virus, two real-time PCR methods were developed and compared, a TaqMan R and Primer-Probe Energy Transfer (PriProET) assay. These robust, highly sensitive methods provide valuable diagnostic tools to investigate zoonotic transmission, to detect the virus in the food chain. They are used in research related to the potential of hepatitis E virus to cross the species barrier. By using the two novel PCR assays a broad range of viruses were detected, representing all the four genotypes of HEV. On comparison, the TaqMan R assay showed higher fluorescence values for positive samples. On the other hand, the PriProET better tolerated the point mutations in the target nucleic acids. Thus, the PriProET provides a more powerful tool to detect new variants of HEV. The two real-time PCR assays are useful novel tools for virus detection and for molecular epidemiology. In addition, the assays provide novel tools to study the biology of the viruses, including the transmission between various species and the zoonotic aspects of HEV infections.",

The assay was highly sensitive with a detection limit corresponding to five copies of viral genome equivalents, and had a high specificity demonstrated by testing of heterologous viruses. A major advantage of the PriProET chemistry is tolerance toward mutations in the probe region. Melting curve analysis directly after PCR, with determination of probe melting point, confirmed specific hybridisation of the SVDV strains. Eight of twenty SVDV strains tested, revealed shifted melting points that indicated mutations in the probe region, which were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. With the PriProET system there is a chance to identify phylogenetically divergent strains of SVDV, which may appear negative in other probe-based real-time PCR assays. Moreover, any difference in melting points may provide an indication of divergence in the probe region. The described SVDV PriProET assay, with high sensitivity, specificity, and tolerance toward mutations in the probe region, provides a powerful tool for the improved and rapid detection of SVDV.

When testing nasal swabs and serum, the sensitivity of the assays was approximately equivalent. Interestingly, by testing faecal samples the RT-LAMP assay performed better.

The probes consist of a protein specific binding part coupled to an oligonucleotide with either a free 3 -or 5 -end capable of hybridizing to a common connector oligonucleotide. When the probes are in proximity, promoted by target binding, then the DNA strands can be joined by enzymatic ligation. The nucleic acid sequence that is formed can then be amplified and quantitatively detected in a real-time monitored polymerase chain reaction.

QuanTyper TM -48, from AlphaHelix Molecular Diagnostics AB, is the first real-time thermo cycling instrument utilizing SuperConvection TM to speed up the cycling process. This is achieved by subjecting the samples to high g-force, (via centrifugation), while cycling the temperature. The result is an increased mixing of the sample fluid that improves both the temperature homogenization and the kinetics of the reaction. This makes the QuanTyper-48 very fast but also very flexible with a vast sample volume range, accommodating reactions from 20 to 200 \u03bcL in volume using standard PCR-tubes. Typically a 20 \u03bcL real-time PCR assay is ready within 15 min while a 200 \u03bcL reaction takes up to 50 min to complete. Since such viruses can also be important factors in various diseases, it is important to work on methods, which facilitate their detection studies viral particles were detected in uncultured environmental and clinical samples, by using random amplification of their nucleic acids, prior to subcloning and sequencing. Already known and novel viruses were then identified by comparing their translated sequence to those of viral proteins in public sequence databases.",

In this context the emergence of \"new\" diseases is a very important issue, which needs special attention and focus. In addition to examples already given, a long list of emerging or re-emerging diseases in various host species, including humans could be drawn up; these include, diseases caused by Hantaviruses, Japanese Encephalitis Virus, HIV, Dengue Viruses, Menangle Virus, Australian Bat Lyssavirus, Ebola virus, Avian flu variants H5N1, SARS coronavirus, Nipah virus and Hendra Virus. Several of these diseases are of very serious global zoonotic concern.",
