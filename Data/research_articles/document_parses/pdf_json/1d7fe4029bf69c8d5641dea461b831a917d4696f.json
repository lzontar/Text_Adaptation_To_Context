I propose new strategy for early detection of superspreaders with reasonable number of RT-PCR tests, which can dramatically mitigate development COVID-19 pandemic and even turn it endemic.",

The proposed full scale model of a metropolis shows that top 10% spreaders (100+ higher viral loading than median infector) transmit 45% of new cases. Rapid isolation of superspreaders leads to 4-8 fold mitigation of pandemic depending on applied quarantine strength and amount of currently infected people. High viral loading allows efficient group \"matrix\" pool testing of population focused on detection of the superspreaders requiring remarkably small amount of tests.",

Different superspreaders thresholds are shown as black bars with corresponding prevalence. Figure 3A shows RT-PCR cycle threshold distribution for COVID-19 positive patients shown as blue bars 12 . Difference in Dct equal to 24 means that viral loading for COVID-19 patients may alter in 2 24 = 16 million times. Error of Dct is about 3 11 . Red curve shows gaussian fit for the Dct, which means log-normal for viral loading. The best fit gave us: m = 2 and s = 3.6. Those values were used to generate distribution of simulated viral loading proportionate to contagiousness of citizens, presented in Figure 3B . The value of C 0 corresponds to median viral loading. The distribution gives us fractions of superspreaders depending of chosen superspreaders threshold, St, i.e. 10% for x100 threshold (superspreaders are defined as people, who are 100+ times more contagious than median infectors), 5.6% for x300, 2.8% for x1000 as it is shown in red area in Figure 3B .

Higher St corresponds to lower amount of daily required RT-PCR tests, but it fails to detect superspreaders below St. Prevalence of superspreaders between different St values as well as corresponding effect of COVID-19 transmission by them are shown on pie charts in Figure 5 . Note, that regardless to St value, throat or/and nasal swabs must be taken from all people attending offices and groceries, which is also a challenge for metropolises. Low St is less important for London, where both relatively low initial IP and strong quarantine, i.e. it is 10% difference for peak IP and 50% for total IP between St = 100 and 1000. Differences increase for total IP with increase of initially IP and reaches 160% for NYC, while low Q in Moscow gives 300% reduction for peak IP. The last one is crucially important, because predicted 2 million COVID-19 patients in Moscow is far over its healthcare capacity, which can result in about 0.5 million excessive deaths. Nevertheless, the prognosis demonstrates catastrophic scenario for Moscow, therefore strong quarantine such as one used in London or NYC is highly recommended regardless of possible new testing strategy application. Superspreaders isolation based mitigation requires mass testing strategy for detection of them. The simplest strategy is make one test for person, but it requires about 2 million test daily, which is obviously impossible to do. However, daily tests requirements can be reduced at least by the factor of 500, if smart matrix group pool testing scheme used (see Figure 6 ). Note, that this scheme is very efficient for detection of superspreaders, but it misses all other infected people. The exact amount of tests depends on the superspreaders threshold St. If it is assumed that viral loading for median spreader is 10 times higher than sensitivity of RT-PCR test (which is true for most used test-systems), then test will give positive result for a superspreader mixed into a pool with 10*S t = 1000 for St = 100 and even more for higher thresholds. But matrix testing requires 2 tests for each specimen, i.e. one in a row and one in a column. Then all specimens in the intersections (highlighted blue) can be tested separately without mixing. This will provide extremely low false positive result ratio, because viral loading is huge in positive tests. In case of low prevalence the additional amount of separate tests will be much lower than 500. Thus, that strategy allows to detect superspreaders by perform 5000 tests daily for megapolices such as Moscow, New York City and London.",

Superspreaders with 10% prevalence amongst infected people transmit 45% cases of COVID-19, therefore their rapid isolation can significantly mitigate pandemic and save thousands of people, as it was shown for London, Moscow and New York City. The isolation can be performed via mass matrix group pool strategy, applied for all people attended to offices and groceries. This strategy requires reasonable amount of RT-PCR tests about 5000 per day.
