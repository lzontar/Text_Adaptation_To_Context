Here, we present 2 cases with both MERS-CoV and pulmonary TB. The first case was a 13-year-old patient who was admitted with a 2-month history of fever, weight loss, night sweats, and cough. The second patient was a 30-year-old female who had a 4-week history of cough associated with shortness of breath and weight loss of 2 kg. The 2 patients were diagnosed with pulmonary TB and had positive MERS-CoV. Both patients were discharged to complete their therapy for TB at home. It is likely that both patients had pulmonary TB initially as they had prolonged symptoms and they subsequently developed MERS-CoV infection. It is important to carefully evaluate suspected MERS-CoV patients for the presence of other infectious diseases, such as TB, especially if cohorting is done for suspected MERS-CoV to avoid nosocomial transmission.",

Clinical presentations, diagnosis, and laboratory findings have been previously described [3] . As highlighted in the previous studies, none of the presenting symptoms helped distinguish patients with MERS-CoV infection from a patient presenting with influenza-like illness [4, 5] . Even with access to a full viral panel on all influenza-like illness patients and with evidence of influenza virus as the etiology, MERS-CoV cannot be ruled out. A previous study showed that 1 out of 5 patients with MERS-CoV had influenza coinfection [6] . Investigation of the initially described 47 MERS-CoV patients showed no coinfection with MERS-CoV as microbiological investigations excluded bacterial pathogens associated with communityacquired pneumonia [7] . Coinfection of MERS-CoV with other viruses such as influenza has been reported [8] .",

Coinfection with M. tuberculosis is of particular importance as the diagnosis of TB might be overlooked and shadowed by concern about MERS-CoV infection, as occurred during the SARS outbreak [12] . One patient contracted SARS when she was cohorted with SARS patients, although she initially had TB [12] . In another report, a healthcare worker had healthcare-associated SARS infection and was diagnosed with pulmonary TB, while 2 other patients were known to have pulmonary TB and had a superinfection with SARS after contact with other hospitalized SARS patients [13] . Another 2 patients had pulmonary TB after recovery from SARS [14] . In this report, the first patient was coinfected with MERS-CoV and pulmonary TB, and might have been infected with both as the M. tuberculosis culture was negative. Both MERS-CoV and TB may cause immune suppression and augment the infection of each other, as was described with SARS and TB [13] . It is important to carefully evaluate suspected MERS-CoV for the presence of other infectious diseases, especially TB, if cohorting is done for suspected MERS-CoV to avoid the nosocomial transmission of TB, as was described with SARS [15] .
