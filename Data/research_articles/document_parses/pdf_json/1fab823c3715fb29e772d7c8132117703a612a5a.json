It is inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish. It uses many particles (candidate solutions) to fly around in the search space to find the best solution. At the same time, they track the best location (best solution) in their own path. In other words, the particles will consider the best solution of their individual and the best solution of the group to get the final best solution. In 1998, Y.Shi and R.C.Eberhart added a weight to control the exploitation and exploration of the PSO algorithm [3] . Because the PSO is simple and computationally inexpensive, it is used in many fields, such as medical diagnosis [4] , network scheduling [5] , robot path planning [6] , wavelength detection [7] and production scheduling [8] and many more.",

Eberhart proposed a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) based on PSO algorithm [9] to solve the optimization problem of discrete space in 1997. In 2008, Yin et al. proposed a new location update formula to improve the BPSO algorithm [10] . In the same year, Wang et al. proposed a new probability mapping formula and applied it to solve the discrete combination of knapsack problems [11] . A key step in BPSO is to require a transfer function to transform the real value to a binary value of 0 or 1. The classical transfer function is an S-shaped transfer function. In 2011, Liu et al. experimentally analyzed the S-shaped transfer function and found the algorithm lack the late local search ability, a V-shaped transfer function, which enhanced the local search ability of the algorithm and effectively improved the performance of the BPSO algorithm [12] . Seyedali et al. also proposed a similar V-shaped transfer function, and compared four S-shaped transfer functions and four V-shaped transfer functions, which proved that the V-shaped transfer function has the advantage of the algorithm [13] .",

Conversely, the smaller the L, the weaker the global exploration and the stronger the local exploitation. According to the basic principle of the swarm intelligence algorithm, the L value should constantly be smaller and smaller. By analyzing the change of the L value over iteration, the relation of the opening size of Vshaped transfer function on the performance of the algorithm can be revealled.
