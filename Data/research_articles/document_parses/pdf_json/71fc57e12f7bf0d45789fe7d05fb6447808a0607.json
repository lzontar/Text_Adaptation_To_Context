The mechanisms of the outbreak are not yet fully clear but the responsible novel zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has high transmissibility. 1 COVID-19 is mainly spread by exposure to respiratory droplets from nearby infected persons. These then get into mucosal membranes in the eyes, nose or mouth, either directly or indirectly, e.g. via touching one's face with a contaminated hand.",

The mortality rate varies depending on local factors and is about 2%, i.e. about 10 time higher than regular seasonal influenza infections. Older adults and those with preexisting medical illnesses (e.g. diabetes, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease) are at greatest risk of death from COVID-19 with a mortality of around 10%. Interestingly, children are much less susceptible to COVID-19 than adults.",
