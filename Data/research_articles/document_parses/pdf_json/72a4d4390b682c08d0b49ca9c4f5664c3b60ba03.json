            "text": "Migration of humans shapes the distribution and patterns of infectious diseases globally (Wilson, 1995a) . This has been true throughout recorded history (Berlinguer, 1992; Bruce-Chwatt, 1968; Crosby, 1989; Winkelstein, 1995) . Today human travel is unprecedented in volume, reach, and speed. This massive and rapid movement is occurring in the context of global changes that favor the appearance of previously unrecognized microbial threats and a change in the distribution and burden from well known infectious diseases (Smolinski, Hamburg, & Lederberg, 2003; Wilson, Levins, & Spielman, 1994) . Humans, in addition to carrying their own assemblage of microbial flora, orchestrate the movement of other species and biological material through extensive global travel and trading networks (Wilson, 2003) . Humans also explore and enter new areas and change the environment in ways that place them at risk for new microbial threats (Wilson, 2000) . Infectious diseases also threaten plants and animals; infections in other species have economic consequences and have direct and indirect impacts on human health and well being (Wilson, 1995b) . Animals increasingly are recognized as a source of many newly recognized infectious diseases in humans. Social, economic, political, climatic, technologic, and environmental patterns influence microbial threats to health as well as their consequences and the responses to them. This chapter will review these themes and the central role of human migration in the dynamic geography of infectious diseases and context in which this is occurring (see Table 2 .1).",

Although leisure, recreation, and holidays accounted for more than 50% of global travel in 2005, about 16% of global international travel was for business and professional reasons. In the 1990s, more than 5,000 airports had regularly scheduled international flights, linking urban and periurban areas throughout the world. Destinations are shifting, with increasing numbers of travelers visiting Asia and developing countries in Africa. Through adventure travel organizations using current technology (including small planes, helicopters, boats, etc.), more travelers are reaching remote areas. In the U.S., more than 44 million flights take place annually through 19,500 U.S. airports (Fischetti, 2004) . More than 5,000 airplanes are simultaneously airborne at peak times. The projected number of air travelers in the U.S. in 2003 was 641 million with 117 million being international travelers.",

Troops are regularly mobilized for military, humanitarian, and other support services; populations are displaced because of political, economic, ethnic reasons, or environmental changes, or catastrophic events, such as floods, hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Refugees and displaced persons may live in crowded temporary facilities, often with limited access to clean water and food and sanitary facilities (Toole, 1994) . Poor housing may allow exposure to mosquitoes and other disease vectors and to rodents and other animals that can be a source of infection (Connolly, Gayer, Ryan, Salama, Spiegel, & Heymann, 2004) . Good medical care may be limited or absent, allowing preventable and treatable infectious diseases, such as measles and cholera, to spread in the crowded community with resulting high mortality. As of 2002, an estimated 35 million people worldwide were fleeing war or persecution, the highest number since the 1940s. In the U.S., there are 34.2 million foreign-born residents, more than half from Latin America and about a quarter from Asia (Doyle, 2005 ). An estimated 10.3 million of them are illegal immigrants, many of whom lack access to preventive services and medical care. 22 Mary E.

Today much can be done to reduce but not eliminate risk to travelers. In the era before vaccines and antimicrobials were available, visits to most tropical areas were substantially more dangerous. Curtin (1989) , in his book, Death by Migration, analyzes the excess mortality in European troops stationed in various locations and quantifies what he calls \"relocation costs\" -comparing mortality of troops in England and France, for example, with those in various locations in Africa and Asia during the same years.",

With cruise ships, the time and place of transport become the primary place of activity. Cruise ships are often massive, transporting thousands of passengers and crew in a conveyance with many shared indoor spaces. Passengers from multiple different origins travel together for a few to many days in a common environment and then disperse to multiple destinations, providing an ideal way to disseminate infections that are spread from person to person, such as influenza (Miller, Tam, Maloney, Fukuda, Cox, Hockin, Kertesz, Klimov, & Cetron, 2000) and norovirus infection. Many outbreaks have been documented on cruise ships, including rubella (CDC, 1998), Legionnaires disease (Jernigan, Hofman, Cetron, M, Genese, C, Nuorti, Pekka Fields, Benson, Carter, Edelstein, Guerro, Paul, Lipman, & Breiman, 1996) and gastrointestinal infections (Minooee & Richman, 1999) . En route transmission has been documented on airplanes and trains, including potentially fatal infections such as tuberculosis (TB) (and multidrug resistant TB) (Kenyon, Valway, Ihle, Onorato, & Castro, 1996) and SARS. On a 3-hour flight between Hong Kong and Beijing carrying 120 persons, one symptomatic passenger, who later died of SARS, spread infection to 8 of 23 persons seated in the three rows in front of him. Overall, 22 passengers on the plane became ill, 16 with laboratory-confirmed SARS, and others with illness consistent with SARS (Olsen, Chang, Cheung, Tang, Fisk, Ooi, Kuo, Jiang, Chen, Lando, Hsu, Chen, & Dowell, 2003) . Transmission of influenza on a commercial aircraft has also been documented (Moser, Bender, Margolis, Noble, Kendal, & Ritter, 1979) .

The microbial community in one adult human weighs up to one kg and may include 100 trillion bacteria, the largest numbers residing in the large bowel (Nicholson, Holmes, Lindon, & Wilson, 2004) . Humans not only pick up and drop off microbes during travel but interact with them immunologically influencing which strains or variants survive. Humans also carry microbial genetic material, including resistance genes (O'Brien, Pla, Mayer, Kishi, Gilleece, Syvanen, & Hopkins, 1985; Okeke & Edelman, 2001) . Humans also have distinctive, individual genetic characteristics, which can make them more or less susceptible to certain infections or likely to suffer severe consequences from them. Humans may provide the vessel where microbes undergo mutation or exchange genetic material. Humans can acquire and transport potential pathogens and resistance genes in the absence of symptoms. For example, strains of Neisseria meningitidis W135, a cause of meningitis and sepsis, colonized the nasopharyngeal tissues of pilgrims to the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, often without causing symptoms. In some instances, after the pilgrims returned home, the bacteria spread to family members or other close contacts, leading to serious infection (Dull, Abdelwahab, & Sacchi, 2005; Hahne, Gray, Aguilera, Crowcroft, Nichols, Kaczmarski, & Ramsay, 2002; Wilder-Smith, Barkham, Earnest, & Paton, 2002) . Gastrointestinal carriage of the polio virus by visitors to countries with inadequate vaccine coverage, especially if sanitation is poor, can spark new cases (Heymann & Aylward, 2004) . Transmission of some human pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus and HIV, can occur in the absence of symptoms and long after the infection was acquired. TB can reactivate years after acquisition in a place far from where it was acquired.",

Investigation revealed that prairie dogs (captured in the U.S. to be sold as pets) had been housed with exotic rodents imported from Ghana in Africa. The rodents had unrecognized infection with monkeypox, which spread from them to the prairie dogs, which were sold as pets and infected their human owners. The U.S. also exports animals for pets. In 2002, tularemia, an infection that can be fatal to humans, caused a die-off in wild-caught prairie dogs at a Texas animal facility (Petersen, Schriefer, Carter, Zhou, Sealy, Bawiec, Yockey, Urich, Zeidner, Svashia, Kool, Buck, Lindley, Celeda, Monteneiri, Gage, & Chu, 2004) .

This underscores a need to have a better understanding of interspecies transmission of viruses and other pathogens (Webby, Hoffmann, & Webster, 2004) . Some recently identified agents of zoonoses, in addition to monkeypox virus, include the SARS coronavirus, avian influenza, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob, HIV, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, several newly identified hantaviruses, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Travel and trade have played a pivotal role in the emergence and spread of most of these, either through movement of infected animals or their tissues or humans. Most, but not all, are viruses. Notably, multiple different modes of transmission are involved. Fortunately for humans, at present only one, HIV, has the characteristics that allow it to undergo sustained transmission from person to person, which it has done inexorably around the globe, largely via sexual transmission. There is good evidence that the AIDS pandemic originated from multiple independent introductions of simian immunodeficiency viruses from African apes and monkeys into humans and their subsequent evolution and spread (Hahn, Shaw, De Cock, & Sharp, 2000; Sharp, Bailles, Chaudhuri, Rodenburg, Santiago, & Hahn, 2001) .",

The virus has an expanded mammalian range (including cats and zoo animals, such as tigers and leopards) and has infected humans who have had close contact with avian species. To date, fewer than 200 human cases have been documented, but mortality has been high (about 50%). If the virus evolves, via mutation, recombination or reassortment, to become easily transmissible from person to person, it could cause global devastation. Recently scientists were successful in characterizing the genes of the virus causing the 1918 influenza, which was estimated to cause 40 million or more deaths globally, and found that the virus was likely derived from an avian source (Taubenberger, Reid, Lourens, Wang, Guozhong, & Fanning, 2005) .",

Mosquitoes are regularly transported by planes and boats and other conveyances of human transport and trade (Lounibos, 2002) . In 1985, the mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito) was introduced into North America (Texas) from Asia (Hawley, Reiter, Copeland, Pumpuni, & Craig, 1987) . Aedes mosquito eggs are desiccation resistant and survived the trip by ship in the protected environment of used tires. The mosquito subsequently spread to at least 25 states over 12 years, its movements following interstate highways, presumably carried by human traffic and trade (Moore & Mitchell, 1997) . In recent years it has been introduced into many countries in Latin America. In the past, water containers on ships provided a protected habitat for mosquitoes during travel; modern ships, especially those with container vessels, likewise have been effective in permitting the survival and introduction of mosquitoes into new areas. This is relevant to human health because Aedes albopictus is competent to transmit a number of viruses that are human pathogens, and it was the primary vector implicated in the dengue outbreak in Hawaii in -2002 (Effler, Pang, Kitsutani, Ayers, Nakata, Vorndam, Elm, Tom, Reiter, Rigau-Perez, Hayes, Mills, Napier, Clark, & Gubler, 2005 .",

Mosquitoes, house flies, and beetles have also been shown to survive in wheel bays of airplanes on flights of 6 to 9 hours (Russell, 1987) . In a quantitative risk assessment of pathways by which West Nile Virus (WNV) could reach Hawaii, investigators estimated that 7 to 70 infected mosquitoes could reach the island each year, based on number of airplane flights arriving from areas with ongoing viral circulation and the expected number of viable mosquitoes per flight. They concluded that human-transported mosquitoes and humantransported birds or other vertebrates posed the greatest risk for introduction of WNV into Hawaii (Kilpatrick, Gluzberg, Burgett, & Daszak, 2004) . WNV entered the U.S. (presumably in an infected human, mosquito, or bird) in 1999 (Nash, Mostashari, Fine, Miller, O'Leary, Murray, Huant, Rosenberg, Greenberg, Sherman, Wong, & Layton, 2001 ) and subsequently has spread throughout the continental U.S., into Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central America. Migrating birds have played an essential role in the movement of WNV in the Americas (Rappole, Derrickson, & Hubalek, 2000) , a region already inhabited by several mosquito species competent to transmit it.",

An important source of infection was thought to be fresh cheese made in Mexico from unpasteurized milk and brought to the U.S.A study published in 2000 found that 17% of cattle sampled at meat-processing plants in Mexico were infected with M. bovis (Milian, Sanchez, Toledo, Ramirez, & Santillan, 2000) . In the U.S. human infection with M. bovis has become rare because of pasteurization of milk and disease control in cattle herds.",

Only a tiny fraction of microbes have been identified and characterized. Contrary to common belief, most microbes do not harm humans, and many are essential for life as we know it. Human life as it exists today would be impossible without the beneficial services performed by microbes. Microbes are abundant and also resilient, living in a broad range of habitats, and many being able to survive at extremes of heat, cold, pH, and salinity that would kill humans. They also have a short generation time, giving them capacity to undergo rapid evolution. The generation time for a staphylococcus is 20 to 30 minutes, in contrast to 20 to 30 years for humans. Microbes undergo change through mutation and other molecular maneuvers that allow them to exchange or acquire new genetic material (e.g., through recombination, conjugation, reassortment) and respond rapidly to changes in the environment. The exposure of a microbe to an antimicrobial or specific chemical represents just another change in the environment and one that microbes adapt to regularly.",

The size of the domestic animal population, driven by the need for animal protein and nutrition for the growing human population, is also larger than ever in history. Because of limited habitable space on the earth, more humans are living in close proximity to large animal populations. Figures in China illustrate the changes over a few decades. In 1968, at the time of the last influenza pandemic, the human population of China was 790 million, the pig population was 5.2 million, and the poultry population was 12.3 million. The numbers today are 1.3 billion people, 508 million pigs, and 13 billion poultry (Osterholm, 2005) . Many people live in close association with poultry and pigs, a reason for concern given outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1. A larger population provides more hosts in which microbial replication can occur and the potential for the emergence of more transmissible or virulent forms.",

Most new megacities (defined as urban areas with a population of 10 million or more) are in developing countries at low latitudes. Many cities are surrounded by vast periurban slums, where access to clean water, sanitation, and health care is limited. Many of those who have migrated to urban areas have families in rural areas, so connections with rural areas persist. Today about half of people globally live in urban areas, but the urban to rural ratio varies greatly by region. In Latin America and the Caribbean about 75% of the population is urban, in contrast to Africa and Asia where only about 37% of the population lived in urban areas in 2000 (UN Population Division, 2002) . Many people also live and work in large buildings with shared indoor spaces. The trend in urbanization is expected to continue. The combination of mobility, size, and density of the population means that people are having contact with large numbers of people, including some from distant countries. This is relevant given the importance of person-to-person spread in many infectious diseases. Urban populations also may share water supplies; focal contamination can lead to large outbreaks.",

At least 40% of urban growth is from migration. Circulation of some viruses is linked to population size, as the virus must continue to find susceptibles to survive. The maintenance of a dengue virus serotype (an infection transmitted by mosquitoes), for example, requires a population of somewhere between 150,000 and one million (Wilson, 2004) . More and more urban areas in subtropical regions are reaching a critical population size that will permit sustained circulation of dengue virus and increase the risk of severe and complicated forms of dengue fever (hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome). Outbreaks of dengue fever have increased in geographic reach and severity. A contributing factor is the global movement of dengue viruses carried by human travelers. Some dengue viruses are more virulent than others as measured by the level of viremia they produce and their potential to cause hemorrhagic infection (which is more likely to be fatal). Recent studies give evidence that more virulent dengue viruses (Southeast Asian genotype) can \"out compete\" viruses that cause milder infection and can be expected to displace the less virulent viruses. Mosquitoes may also participate in the selection process. In general, mosquitoes are more likely to become infected with a virus that causes higher level and more sustained viremia in humans (Cologna, Armstrong, & Rico-Hesse, 2005) .",
