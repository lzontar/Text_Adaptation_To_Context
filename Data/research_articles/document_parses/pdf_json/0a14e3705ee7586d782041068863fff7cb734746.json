As the challenges of the world increasingly transcend borders, so too have researchers and innovators forged international coalitions to resolve global pathologies. In doing so, new channels of influence and opportunity have opened up for states alongside the 'traditional' modes of foreign diplomacy. Understanding how these channels influence global socio-economic outcomes is thereby crucial for scholars interested in the still-ambiguous structure and processes of global governance. This article advances understanding of the domains of science diplomacy by drawing attention to the 'political intercostalities' of state actors, scientific communities and other transnational actors within the new architectures of global governance. Here we trace the growing array of informal international associations alongside transgovernmental policy networks and 'global public-policy partnerships' that deal with highly specialised and technical matters of international policy and how they are drawn into science diplomacy. This article thus presents a research agenda for a particular mode of 'impact' in politics and international studies.",

Diplomacy is one field of policy and decision-making where science can be transformative (Fedoroff 2009; Lord and Turekian 2007) . In recent years, social and natural science researchers have increasingly become transnational actors in public policy and global governance (see Jasanoff 2004; Stone 2013) . Aided by modern digital communication technologies, research and cross-border collaboration can proceed apace through multinational research networks, achieving momentous feats of scientific discovery from the observation of the Higgs boson at CERN, to the gene-editing innovation of CRISPR (Legrand 2015) or identifying the SARS coronavirus. This is the picture of scholarly research that chips away at the fundamental challenges of the social and natural world. It is why the EU introduced pan-EU collaborative FET Flagships funding for 'visionary, science-driven, large-scale research initiatives addressing grand Scientific and Technological (S&T) challenges'. One project, The Human Brain Project, involves an astonishing 112 partners from across the globe (Horizon 2020 (Horizon , 2017 . This is truly research without borders.",

We have already seen, for example, how developed countries can leverage innovation as a form of developmental aid: using science to eradicate preventable diseases, develop hardy cash crops or share irrigation and water purification technologies. Scholarly research, as readers of this Special Issue will be already be aware, is increasingly beholden to the imperatives of social, political or economic impact. This is the gearing of Universities, as a matter of government policy, to underwrite the 'prosperity of national and global knowledge economies' and act as 'gatekeepers of an information society' (Watermeyer 2014, p. 359) . In short, science is becoming-if it has not already become-a prominent new 'plane' of transnational relationships, and thus a site of interstate contestation.",

            "text": "Second, we advance the conceptualisation of science diplomacy by taking it beyond its roots in methodological nationalism to address new and expanding domains for research impact generally, and science diplomacy specifically, by focusing upon transnational venues of governance. Today, science diplomacy occurs via a fragmented, complex and networked cast of non-state actors, agencies and institutions. This medley of channels has 'perforated' traditional state sovereignty (Constantinou and Der Derian 2010) by diffusing decision-making on national interests into additional cross-state venues of policy debate and regulatory coordination. Our vantage as public policy scholars affords an alternative perspective to the diplomacy literature, which is theoretically premised on International Relations concepts and empirical perspectives. We draw upon policy transfer (Marsh and Sharman 2009), knowledge-utilisation (Boswell 2009 ) and transnational policy network (Pa\u00e1r-J\u00e1kli 2014; Stone 2013) concepts. These analytical lenses bring into focus the micro-processes and interactions that span borders, separate to the grand bargains and high politicking characteristic of international relations scholarship. We understand these interactions as political intercostalities. With etymology in anatomy to describe the internal interactions of muscles, nerves and other vessels to create bodily functions, we propose the term 'intercostalities' to characterise the informal, (often) unrecorded, difficult-to-discern interactions of non-state actors and institutions that connect to, move within, between and across established formal structures of the international system. Third, we engage in a transnational reorientation of policy studies (traditionally focused on national dynamics) to determine how the sciences-in the form of expertise, data or theories and models-are used to inform knowledge of (and institutional solutions for) transnational policy challenges. Policy studies can be connected to the so-called 'new diplomacy' (Pamment 2013) .",

Third, some non-state actors have become science diplomats through their professional activities and the internationalisation of scientific associations.

Yet, amongst branches of government an appetite for scholarly research in UK public policy remains prominent. 1 And, indeed, academics today-in both social and natural sciences-have been left with little choice but to seek demonstrable policy engagement: UK universities' adopted paradigm of 'new managerialism', in which monitoring, performance measurement and target-setting for research and teaching are the norm, enjoins scholars to become 'ever more striving, self-monitoring, entrepreneurial and productive' (Leathwood and Read 2013, p. 1164) . This is in pursuit of promoting activities that produce 'impact' on society, the economy or government. Impact, in this application, is the 'pronounced strategic and organisational focus on the transfer, translation and commercialisation of academic knowledge' (Watermeyer 2014, p. 359) . For academics concerned with policy studies, 'impact' on government decision-making requires two moments: a moment in which impact is achieved and a moment in which impact is demonstrated. That means academics have a priori incentive to pursue research that has impact on government in a manner easily demonstrated. This persists despite a clear sense amongst researchers that transformational research, across academia, is not always immediately and demonstrably apparent and received as impactful:",

Instrumental scholarship, functioning essentially as a guideto-action for government, is often empiricist. This means an emphasis on gathering data-usually but not always quantitative-to accurately pinpoint social pathologies, to discern the contributing cause-and-effect mechanisms of those pathologies and prescribe suitable corrective action for government to take. Any research that falls short of these maxims cannot, by definition, produce the desired 'impact'.

Since New Labour's mantra of 'what matters is what works' took hold in the late 1990s and early 2000s, evidence-based policy-making (EBPM) has entered the lexicon and toolkit of government officials around the world. EBPM represents an appeal to a sober, ostensibly value-neutral rationalisation of social problems and has been fundamental to the redesign of welfare policy (for example, the New Deal; see King and Wickham-Jones 1999; Walker 1999) . The proponents of EBPM argue that rationality-understood as a utilitarian appraisal of policy problems and application of causal logics to achieve optimal socio-economic outcomes-should trump the value-laden dogma of ideological politics. The value of 'well-founded' and 'objective' research is acclaimed (Solesbury 2002, p. 95) . The ambition of a rationalist, anti-dogma, evidence-based policy-making approach led to the creation sub-units of the UK government with a mandate to collate or generate scientific knowledge for policy, such as the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) and the Centre for Management and Policy Studies (CMPS) alongside national funding via the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for the Centre for Evidence-Based Policy. The UK is replete with other longer standing bodies for the organisation of science advice such as the Government Office for Science, and departmental science advisors (such as the Chief Medical Officer) as well as bodies like the Royal Society.",

The externalisation of policy analysis and research is well recognised as having positive attributes in increasing the quality and variety of evidence, and the spread of innovation. Although the international dimensions of policy advice may be mentioned (Gluckman 2016) , these studies have tended to focus on domestic institutions and processes. A recent review acknowledges the gap, noting that more empirical inquiry is needed of 'supranational advisory units' (Craft and Halligan 2016) .

To-date, there is almost no conceptualisation, nor mapping of transgovernmental diplomacy or of science diplomacy either convened or funded by formal International Organisations. According to the Union of International Associations (2013), there are now well over 800 active international and regional organisations. Little scholarly attention is devoted to small and specialised or relatively 'young' International Organisations such as, for example, the Green Climate Fund, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT, or a dozen other international fisheries bodies) or the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat created in 2003. By the very nature of their mandate, their operations rest upon marshalling scientific evidence. As one of these organisations states: 'Science underpins the management decisions made by ICCAT'. 4 Growing in number at a faster rate than these formal intergovernmental organisations, there is a growing array of informal international associations, such as the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Group of 20 and the Clean Energy Ministerial (Vabulas 2018) , matching the growth of transgovernmental policy networks and 'global public-policy partnerships' like GAVI, RSPO and the Roll Back Malaria partnerships mentioned earlier. Many of them deal with highly specialised and technical matters of international policy. From time to time they are drawn into science diplomacy even though their officers and secretariats may not refer to such activity in these terms. Accordingly, our paper represents a research agenda for a particular mode of 'impact' in politics and international studies.",

Rather than assuming that science and politics 'should be natural allies', the reality of networked diplomacy and the administrative challenges it imposes on bureaucracies entail significant policy challenges bringing the two together. Australia's Chief Scientist (2012) stated that global problems need solutions 'to be based not only on sound science, but on sound politics as well'. Likewise, Sir Peter Gluckman, head of the INGSA science advisors network, speaks of 'post-normal science' characterising global challenges. That is, 'areas where the science is complex and inevitably incomplete and where the interface with societal values is often in dispute\u2026 climate change, food security, population health, and terrorism\u2026 have trans-jurisdictional and diplomatic dimensions' (2016).",

It is messy, but it is the real world. In order to be effective, government officials need to respond to transnational policy problems with counterpart public servants in governments overseas; with officials in international organisations and executives of global public-private partnerships and with expert partners in research communities and scientific associations. The diplomatic field diversifies to a wider constellation of actors tackling global problems with science. Nevertheless, these are concerns of social science and public administration too.",

Policy officials (outside MFAs) are not necessarily adequately equipped to effectively engage with transnational policy communities. Training, resourcing and new practices in specific policy sectors suggest reform to build the transnational capacities of government agencies. Inter alia, senior managers may need to see their workforce develop greater abilities in network management and inter-cultural understanding; heightened bureaucratic competence to access and navigate the bureaucracies of international organisation, global partnerships and international funding regimes; increased knowledge of international bench-marking and 'soft law', in addition to technical proficiency in the substantive policy area. Mainstreaming science diplomacy across government departments entails new roles for frontline bureaucratic agents.",

Likewise, the individual researchers based in universities may not have either innate diplomatic skills or keen knowledge of global policy processes. Not only is civil service recruitment and training likely to be transformed by the dynamics of transnational administration, so too universities will increasingly look to recruit and train their own science diplomats. To conclude with the claim of the special editors that political science, public policy and international relations is one of the most 'impactful' disciplines in higher education (see also Stoker et al. 2014) , Science Diplomacy offers considerable scope for these fields, and the higher education sector more generally, to seek and attain 'impact'.",
