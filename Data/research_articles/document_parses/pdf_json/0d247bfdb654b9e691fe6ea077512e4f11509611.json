In this study, we evaluated the in vivo antiviral effects of U18666A by administering it to SPF cats challenged with type I FIPV. Methods: Ten SPF cats were randomly assigned to two experimental groups. FIPV KU-2 were inoculated intraperitoneally to cats. The control group was administered PBS, and the U18666A-treated group was administered U18666A subcutaneously at 2.5 mg/kg on day 0, and 1.25 mg/kg on days 2 and 4 after viral inoculation. Results: Two of the five control cats administered PBS alone developed FIP. Four of the five cats administered U18666A developed no signs of FIP. One cat that temporarily developed fever, had no other clinical symptoms, and no gross lesion was noted on an autopsy after the end of the experiment. The FIPV gene was detected intermittently in feces and saliva regardless of the development of FIP or administration of U18666A. Conclusions: When U18666A was administered to cats experimentally infected with type I FIPV, the development of FIP might be suppressed compared with the control group. However, the number of animals with FIP is too low to establish anti-viral effect of U18666A in cats.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses in the subfamily Coronavirinae of the family Coronaviridae.

In rats, U18666A demonstrated a biphasic elimination pattern consisting of early-rapid clearance (T1/2 = 16 h) 24-36 h after administration and subsequent slow and sustained clearance (T1/2 = 58 h). Based on this report, we assumed the distribution volume in cats to be 600 mL/kg and set a single dosage necessary to obtain an initial blood concentration of 10 \u00b5M (2.5 mg/kg: 6 \u00b5M/kg).
