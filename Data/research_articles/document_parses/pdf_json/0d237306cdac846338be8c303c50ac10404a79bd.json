A year later (2007), and as prelude to the work of Globalization Knowledge Network of the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, globalization was defined as a 'determinant of social determinants' trickling down in ways sometimes healthy, but predominantly health-risky [3] .",

The differential impacts on health of specific food items, in this case palm oil consumption, suggested that globalization's health impacts were not equitably allocated (2011) [6] . Some of globalization's unequal outcomes were manifest in health systems themselves: from radiology services (2010) [7] , to biases that privilege research from rich countries over poorer ones (2017) [8] , to this year's so-far trending lead article on global surgery (2020) [9] .",

Another collection focuses on health system innovations in low-and middleincome countries, belying the notion that such countries lack innovative ideas from which the world at large can learn [18] . The enduring topic of global health partnerships has its own dedicated place in the journal [19], while we recently hosted a special call for papers on intersectoral actions for health in the SDG that generated a range of new contributions [20] . There is also a new open collection, timely given the COVID-19 crisis, examining governance and preparedness for infectious disease threats [21] . The journal also published our first supplement in 2019 on the political determinants of health inequities and universal health coverage [22] . Many of these specially edited collections were published in collaboration with partnering universities and institutions.",

A surge in single country health studies a few years ago had the editorial team reformulate more precisely the journal's scope to ensure its focus on the importance of how globalization processes affected health outcomes, whether in a given country, crossnationally interrogated, or examined at a global scale [23] . The accompanying re-design in our sections and editorial processes, and a revitalization of our Editorial Board, has made the scholarship we publish more germane to globalization and health researchers and, we hope, more useful to global health policy-makers and advocates.",
