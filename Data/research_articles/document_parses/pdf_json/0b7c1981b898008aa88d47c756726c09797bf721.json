We apply the concept of resilience and adaptation to Slavutych atomograd following the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Station explosion. Challenges and responses facing the urban management and planning systems are examined. Perceptions of Slavutych's resilience capacity are integrated into research based on a survey of residents. The main challenges faced were lack of targeted financing; insufficient economic diversification and professional employment opportunities; an aging population and outmigration of youth and professionals; physical remoteness from the Kyiv Region; declining quality of municipal infrastructure, poor housing and community services; and slow introduction of market mechanisms. Resilience potential formation is used in effective municipal management practices, stimulating innovations in nuclear/alternative energy, IT, and cultural/artistic events. Urban management and planning systems remain active and are ongoing.",

Cities in post-communist countries, including Ukraine, are undergoing significant changes in their political and socio-economic systems with the result that global impulses are imposed on many internal features that are considered relicts of the previous epoch (Maruniak 2007) . In a socio-political context these relate to the gradual transition from a previous period of rigid regulation and prescriptive planning to efforts toward creating a competitive business environment. Urban processes and spaces shaped during the planned economy are being transformed and influenced by the political, economic and cultural transition to capitalism (S\u00fdkora 2009 ). In some cases, urban development is complicated by individual problems having different origins, for example, the political influence of neighboring countries, natural or human-made disasters, and the loss and closure of city-forming enterprises.",

The case study examined is Ukraine's youngest city, the last urban utopia of the Soviet Union's ideal cities, the Slavutych atomograd. Its foundation was the result of a major industrial disaster viz, the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Station (ChNPS) which faced an emergency status following the April 1986 explosion. This new monofunctional city for the ChNPS workers was constructed in two years by political decisions and various management instruments and through the efforts of architects and designers from various Union republics. The closure of ChNPS in 2000 created the major challenge facing the city of Slavutich. Having existed now for more than thirty years, the city is an example of classical urban development including stages of prosperity and decline and rebirth which are inherent in cities with a lengthy or short history. A detailed analysis is included about the threats and perspectives of ''resilience potential'' facing a young Ukrainian monofunctional city with a unique origin, especially since there are limited research publications in post-communist space that address urban development within the context of urban resilience (Bouzarovski et al. 2011; Denysenko 2015; Golubchikov et al. 2015) .",

Second, and at a practical level, we examine the challenges and responses to them in Slavutych by using various scientific and open sources (programs, reports and strategies) as well as official statistics and personal observations. Third, we conduct a survey of city residents that sought to integrate the social dimensions of the challenges along with prospects for building the resilience potential. In short, the research methodologies adopted combined a system-structural approach and situational analysis, a survey and a mix of chorological, historical, statistical and other methods. We recognize that resilience formation processes are different for each city and hope that this case study will prove useful in useful urban strategies for decision-making systems elsewhere.",

In different fields, resilience is considered an answer to the world of rapid change, complexities and unexpected events. The term itself was adopted by the social sciences from the natural sciences as it expands the traditional notion of ecosystem resilience (Berkes 2007) . The concept appears in various forms and especially as it relates to the various factors affecting it. It does, however, contain some conceptual fuzziness, especially when applied to ''social worlds'' and especially interdisciplinary collaboration (Star and Griesemer 1989) . In contemporary western scientific literature, resilience concepts and practices extend across a wide range of security and policy issues, including environmental security, military programs, critical infrastructure, migration policies, counterterrorism, landscape and urban planning (Dunn Cavelty et al. 2015) .",

These studies are closely linked to literature on new or constantly updated methods of prediction, caution, prevention and risk as they relate to security management (Rasmussen 2007; Petersen 2012) . Recognizing that the concept contains elements of both uncertainty and unpredictability, it is not surprising that it has appeared in research on national security and international relations. According to Biriukov (2015) , ''resilience'' is achieved through formation of a partnership between the state, society and business to ensure national security. Such a partnership is important in being able to withstand challenges and threats from other spheres of human activity.",

That is, the concept refers to the ability of the city to respond to challenges, while preserving the basic structure and operational mode, its ability to selforganize as well as its ability to adapt to stress and change. The concept itself expresses the city's degree of readiness to counteract negative influences.

To be effective it should be based on the study of environmental, economic, social factors and trends or specific space changes that can be integrated into a variety of interconnected scopes of preventive activity at different hierarchical levels (Pickett et al. 2004) .

It demonstrates the ability of Soviet planners to discard many of the characteristics of the other typical Soviet faceless satellite cities for a nuclear power station. New architectural trends, an increase in creative freedom and the growing influence of Western architecture were incorporated with old construction methods used in previous city planning and building approaches. Thus, Slavutych represents balances between the Soviet and the foreign, between isolation and internationalism, and between the modernism and postmodernism. Slavutych was the last major urban project of the Soviet era; the USSR provided generous funding for this showcase construction project (Gubkina 2016) .",

Each participant was sent one completed questionnaire which reduced the risks of manipulating any results. It also included a number of open questions. More than 100 separate comments were received. Against this background, we consider this survey a qualitative study that reflects the views of a wide range of residents' opinions about the quality of life in the city and also major local problems. Separate questions were asked about the causes of migration which we consider threats to urban resilience. The survey results of former residents significantly improved the overall picture of the research results by taking into account the dynamics of migration. In total, 312 questionnaires were received from those who now live in the city and 89 from those who left the city. In the analysis we were more focused on comments, since those results guided our research and helped us understand the urban resilience potential.

Almost all respondents pointed out that there is no high paid work in the city and some link their departure to family circumstances (Fig. 9) . The migration decisions did not differ according to gender and education level, but it should be noted that the share of respondents of younger age cohorts who plan to leave the city is high, compared with the age distribution of all respondents. Hired workers (including those responding to the ChNPS) are least likely to migrate while the unemployed, entrepreneurs and students are more inclined to leave.

But the residents of Slavutych are united, very active and well organized to promote community engagement. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the ability of the Slavutych management and planning system to build adaptive resilience mechanisms responding to immediate challenges is much higher than in other Ukrainian cities. The major preconditions for such success are having a strong city development strategy and a municipal government that focuses on countering the main threat related to its economic base and reducing the number of jobs. Ensuring the equal participation of all stakeholders in decision-making process facilitates both high levels of investment and business activity and high levels of cohesion of residents throughout the entire transformation period, a process that began in 2000 when the decision was made to close the ChNPS.",

There were several successful initiatives implemented in the past 20 years, however not all have launched in directions that advanced the city's development. We believe that the adaptive resilience potential of Slavutych regarding the specific problems that have been identified is high. However, a separate share of socio-economic problems, identified during our research, is not unique to the city. It is connected with an imperfect regulatory framework within Ukraine, the incompleteness of the decentralization reform, low financial opportunities, paternalistic sentiments of the communities, and other difficulties in the post-communist period.",

This happened with the young Ukrainian monofunctional city, Slavutych atomograd, which was built in accordance with the concept of creating a comfortable city for people and further lost its city-forming economic base. The closure of ChNPS at the request of the international community led to workplace losses and a reduction in financial support for urban development.",

Slavutych is actively working to improve its management and planning system with public participation in urban development processes encouraged by the ''Regional Development Agency.'' Partial responses to socio-economic challenges include the search for external opportunities being initiated through a series of international projects that have impacts at local levels. The internal innovative, tourist and cultural potentials are actively developing but remain not fully involved. Progress is hampered by some paternalistic sentiments of the inhabitants, lack of knowledge in the fields of business and entrepreneurship, low financial opportunities and effective bureaucratic procedures.",

The city's adaptation to new conditions is selective. A variety of adaptation mechanisms still are not leading to highly positive urban transformational effects, but application of some is allowing the city to take leading positions in the current ratings of Ukrainian cities. These changes acknowledge that the post-communist transformation period continues as the city continues to generate and test innovations. Adaptation needs to remain high to ensure there is resilience in the face of new challenges and threats. To understand more about Slavutych's resilience it is important to conduct additional research on the city's ability to use the opportunities provided by the national decentralization reform, as well as the research into specific public activities that are catalysts for resilience building amidst various external threats (e.g. . A broader study of urban resilience would also undertake a comparative analysis of several Ukrainian monofunctional cities, especially investigating the challenges they face including deindustrialization, depopulation, and environmental threats. Such investigation will allow us to obtain a deeper reflection of the resilience loss factors and the mechanisms for its restoration.",

Today the main areas of economic activities in the city are still related to nuclear energy, primarily decommissioning of the power units of ChNPS and transformation of the object ''Shelter'' into an environmentally safe system (State Joint Venture ''Chornobyl NPS'' of the State Agency of Ukraine for Management the Exclusion Zone, the French JV ''Novarka''), as well as the making repairs at other nuclear power plants of Ukraine. These efforts include modernization, reconstruction and designing (IE ''Atomremontservis'' of SE NAEK ''Energoatom''). The economic development of Slavutych focuses on the ChNPS, especially the industrial site of the Station as a unique place for carrying out high-tech projects. The State Research Institute named ''The Chornobyl Center for Nuclear Safety, Radioactive Waste and Radioecology Issues'' is engaged in research activities in the city's exclusion zone.",

Such activities have been typical for Slavutych since its inception; these include international sports tournaments, music festivals including some held in the early 1990s (Chronicle of Slavutych\u2026, 2019); Patricia Kaas and Kenzo Takada, Presidents of Ukraine, other well-known personalities have visited the city in different years. The experience of world-class events arrangement has a multiplier effect. Now, the International Film and Urban Festival ''86,'' summer schools, international conferences, seminars, round tables, business trainings and other public events are held regularly. The tourist complex of the city also has potential for development related to excursions to the ChNPS and the Chornobyl Radiation and Ecological Biosphere Reserve.",
