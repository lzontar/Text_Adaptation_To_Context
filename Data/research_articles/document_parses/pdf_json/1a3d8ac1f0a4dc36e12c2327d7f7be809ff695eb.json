Therefore, patients affected by colorectal cancer on a waiting list for surgery in \"hot\" COVID-19 areas suddenly were left without any chance to be treated. Thus, the National Cancer Institute of Milan (Lombardy, Italy), a comprehensive cancer center, was identified as an oncologic hub to provide surgical treatment for those patients. The mission was to dispose of that impressive waiting list as soon as possible, keeping our hospital \"COVID-free\" in the safest setting at the same time.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "From 9 March to 24 April 2020 at the Colorectal Surgery Unit of the National Cancer Institute of Milan, a total of 54 patients affected by colorectal cancer were managed. Of these, 29 (53.7%) were cases from the institutional waiting list and 25 (46.3%) from the Lombardy oncologic hub list, coming mainly from the province of Bergamo. To manage patients from both hub and our institutional waiting list, prioritization was applied to each patient as following: red code (high priority, within 2 weeks) for complicated/symptomatic colorectal cancer (obstruction, perforation, bleeding); yellow code (medium priority, within 4 weeks) for cT2-T4, N0-N + colon or rectal cancer with indication for upfront surgery or rectal cancer awaiting more than 8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation; green code (low priority, within 8 weeks) for cT1N0 colon cancer or positive margins after endoscopic polypectomy. The day before hospitalization, patients were called by phone to rule out symptoms compatible with COVID-19 disease, such as fever and/or cough, and/or dyspnea. If no symptom was reported, patients were admitted to our Institute the following day to complete the dedicated triage, consisting in blood analyses, and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. In case of lymphopenia, increased biomarkers of inflammation, and/or radiological ground-glass opacities, patients were immediately tested for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab and discharged. All other patients were admitted for hospitalization. Patients from the hub list were re-evaluated by a restricted multidisciplinary colorectal cancer team. Laparoscopic approach was suspended to reduce the risk of aerosolization and the surgical time.

Of the latter seven patients, four resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2. After a period of 15 days at home, they had regression or stability on CT scans and were admitted for hospitalization. The other three patients resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were kept at home for a 28-day quarantine: one suddenly developed pneumonia and died of COVID-19; the other two patients remained asymptomatic, and after two negative swabs and evidence of regression of CT scan findings, were admitted for hospitalization. Clinical and pathological variables are reported in Table 1. To minimize or to defer surgery, in two cT1 and in one cT0 restaged after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer, endoscopic full-thickness resection or trans-anal local excision were carried out. A shorter surgical time in the hub patients depended on minimizing surgery, sometimes avoiding colorectal anastomosis, as suggested by persistent but milder chest-CT findings observed in 28% of them. In fact, in three hub rectal cancer patients over 80 years of age who were not fit for chemoradiation, Hartmann's procedure was performed. Moreover, in three patients with obstructive rectal cancer, a loop colostomy was fashioned before neoadjuvant treatment. Only 6 out of our 12 colorectal team members performed surgery on hub patients, to limit the risk. Postoperative morbidity rates were similar in the two waiting list groups, despite a significantly higher age, white blood cells count, platelets, number of chest CT scan findings, longer time from diagnosis to surgery, lower pathological stages 0-I (28.0 vs 48.2%, P = .382), worse ASA scores III-IV (52.0 vs 27.5%, P = .095), and a red-code priority level in the hub group.
