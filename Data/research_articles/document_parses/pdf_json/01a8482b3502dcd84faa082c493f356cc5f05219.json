            "text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing explosive epidemic of COVID19 disease has generated a need for assays to rapidly and conveniently measure the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Here, we describe a collection of approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus. While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both convalescent plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus correlated quantitatively with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The assays described herein are adaptable to high throughput and are useful tools in the evaluation of serologic immunity conferred by vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the potency of convalescent plasma or human monoclonal antibodies. : bioRxiv preprint Herein, we describe assays based on pseudotyped and chimeric viruses that our laboratories have used to measure the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma and to identify potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These assays are rapid and convenient. Using a panel of convalescent plasma and human RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrate that these assays provide measurements of virus neutralization that are well correlated with a neutralizing antibody test employing authentic SARS-CoV-2 virions. As such, these tools are useful to estimate SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the context of recovery from infection, in experimental vaccine recipients and to evaluate the potency of antibody-based therapy and prophylaxis",

These antibodies likely provide at least some degree of protection against reinfection. However, in the case of the seasonal coronaviruses, epidemiological and human challenge experiments indicate that protection is incomplete and diminishes with time, concurrent with declining neutralizing antibody titers (Callow et al., 1990; Kiyuka et al., 2018) . The neutralizing antibody response to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is highly variable (Alshukairi et al., 2016; Cao et al., 2007; Choe et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2006; Mo et al., 2006; Okba et al., 2019; Payne et al., 2016) , and because human infection by these viruses is rare (MERS-CoV) or apparently absent (SARS-CoV), the extent to which prior infection elicits durable protection against reinfection is unknown. For SARS-CoV-2, early studies, including our own, indicate that the magnitude of antibody responses is extremely variable, and a significant fraction of convalescents have comparatively low to undetectable levels of plasma neutralizing antibodies (Robbiani et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) . Thus, the effectiveness and durability of immunity conferred by primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, particularly in those who mount weaker immune response and is obviously a pressing issue, given the global spread of this virus. Moreover, because treatment and prevention modalities for SARS-CoV-2 are urgently sought, convalescent plasma is being evaluated for COVID19 therapy and prophylaxis (Bloch et al., 2020) . Clearly, the effectiveness of such an intervention is likely to be profoundly impacted by the levels of neutralizing antibodies in donated convalescent plasma.",

Potent antibodies can be isolated from individuals with high or unexceptional plasma neutralizing titers, suggesting that natural infection in some individuals does not induce sufficient B-cell expansion and maturation to generate high levels of such antibodies (Robbiani et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a) .

For this reason, the availability of rapid, convenient and accurate assays that measure neutralizing antibody activity is crucial for evaluating naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity. Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using traditional plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) is labor intensive, requires biosafety level (BSL)-3 laboratory facilites and is not amenable to high throughput. Thus, various assays based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or human immunodeficiency virus type -1 (HIV-1) virions, pseudotyped with the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are high-throughput and can executed at BSL-2 will be essential to evaluate neutralization activity. These pseudotype virus assays offer numerous advantages (Crawford et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020) , but their ability to predict plasma neutralization activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2, or correctly identify the most potent human monoclonal antibodies has not been rigorously evaluated.",

While the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein supported the generation of infectious virions that gave a luminescence signal higher than that of virions lacking S, both the \u039418 and \u039419 truncated forms generated ~10-fold higher titers of infectious particles than the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. S1C) .

Thus, the dynamic range of these HIV-1 pseudotype infection assays, formatted in 96-well plates, is between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude, depending on the amount of pseudotyped virus and the particular target cell line used. This dynamic range is more than adequate for accurate determinations of plasma neutralizing activity as well as determination of potency (IC50 and IC90) of monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Sdependent viral entry.",

As was the case with HIV-1 pseudotypes, the level of rVSV\u0394G/NG-NanoLuc/SARS-CoV-2 infection was dependent on the level of ACE2 expression ( Fig. S3E) , although the levels of endogenously expressed ACE2 in Huh7.5 cells and Vero E6 cells were sufficient to give a robust signal (Fig. 2D) . Indeed, we used Huh7.5 cells hereafter, unless otherwise indicated A disadvantage of the NanoLuc luciferase reporter, is that this protein is highly stable, more so than other luciferases. Because rVSV\u0394G replication is quite cytopathic, pseudotype virion preparations were contaminated with NanoLuc luciferase protein, which elevated the assay background. However, this problem could be relieved by pelleting virions by ultracentrifugation through sucrose, or concentration using Lenti-X ( Fig S3F) . Indeed, counting of mNeonGreen infected cells and luciferase quantitation ( Fig 2B, Fig S3A) revealed that individual infected Huh7.5 cells yielded ~6x10 3 RLU per infected cell. Thus, like the HIV-1-based assay, the rVSV\u0394G/NG-NanoLuc/SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infection assay had a dynamic range of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, when formatted in 96-well plates.",

Thus, in this construct, the SARS-CoV-2 S replaces the native VSV-G protein (Fig. 3A ). The recombinant virus was rescued in 293T cells by coexpressing T7 polymerase and complementing VSV proteins. The rescued virus was passaged once in 293T cells transfected with a VSV-G-expression plasmid to facilitate initial virus amplification. Since G is not encoded in the recombinant virus genome, subsequent rounds of infection were dependent on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Thus, thereafter the complemented rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP virus was used to infect 293T/ACE2(B) cells (in the absence of the complementing VSV-G protein) and infection monitored by observation of GFP expression.",

Twenty convalescent plasma samples that displayed a range of neutralization activities against authentic SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 4A ) were also evaluated in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1NL\u0394Env-NanoLuc and rVSV\u0394G/NG-NanoLuc as well as in replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays ( Fig 4B) . Despite the fact that these neutralization assays have quite different dynamic ranges, employ different virion scaffolds and target cell lines, and involve single-cycle replication-defective or multi-cycle replication-competent viruses, the plasma neutralization titers obtained with the surrogate virus approaches were each well correlated with titers obtained using authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4C) . Notably, the HIV-1NL\u0394Env-NanoLuc and rVSV\u0394G/NG-NanoLuc pseudotyped viruses gave NT50 values that indicated marginally reduced sensitivity to plasma antibodies as compared to authentic SARS-CoV-2, with the rVSV\u0394G/NG-NanoLuc appearing to more sensitively detect weak plasma neutralizing activity ( Fig 4C) than HIV-1NL\u0394Env-NanoLuc. Conversely, the replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 was more sensitive to plasma neutralization than authentic SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, each of the surrogate viruses was able to provide a good indication of plasma neutralizing potency against authentic SARS-CoV-2 Next, we evaluated 15 human monoclonal antibodies that were identified by sorting of individual SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding B-cells (Robbiani et al., 2020) . The panel was selected on the basis of neutralization potency using the HIV-1NL\u0394Env-NanoLuc assay, and all had IC50 values ranging between 3ng/ml and 60ng/ml in this assay. These antibodies all potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 5A) , as well as the HIV-1NL\u0394Env-NanoLuc and rVSV\u0394G/NG-NanoLuc pseudotyped viruses and the replication competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses ( Fig   5B) . Each of the surrogate viruses gave IC50 values for the antibody panel that correlated well with IC50 values measured using authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5C ). Interestingly, among the surrogate viruses, the two VSV-based viruses were the most different in terms of relative sensitivity to the monoclonal antibody panel. Specifically, while there was a good linear relationship between the IC50 values measured using SARS-CoV-2 and the rVSV\u0394G/NG-NanoLuc pseudotype virus, the latter was generally less sensitive to neutralization (Fig. 5C ).",

Many factors could, in principle, affect the apparent potency of neutralizing antibodies as measured using surrogate viruses. One key factor may be the density of spikes on the virion envelope. Spike density could affect the avidity of bivalent antibodies, particularly those that are unable to engage two S-protein monomers within a single trimer and whose potency is dependent on engaging two adjacent trimers {Barnes, 2020 #41} (Galimidi et al., 2015) . Electron microscopic images of coronaviruses indicate a fairly high spike density, and the extent to which pseudotyped viruses mimic this property might be important for determining the accuracy of neutralization assays.

Moreover, the use of replication competent, multicycle replication-based assays, versus single-cycle infection with defective reporter viruses could additionally affect apparent neutralizing antibody potency. Partial neutralization at marginal antibody concentrations in a single replication cycle might be amplified over multiple rounds of replication. Alternatively, the increase in viral dose during multiple replication cycles, or the high multiplicity associated with direct cell-to-cell viral spread might overwhelm neutralizing antibodies at marginal dilutions in multi-cycle neutralization assays. Such a scenario would reduce apparent antibody potency compared to single-cycle assays. Finally, viruses may also generate defective or noninfectious particles to varying degrees which could sequester neutralizing antibodies and therefore affect neutralization potency. Despite the very different nature of the assays employed herein, as well as their different dynamic ranges, each of the surrogate virus-based assays generated quantitative measurements of neutralizing activity that correlated well with neutralization measured using authentic SARS-CoV-2. Naturally, the above considerations mean that these correlations are not precise; for example, both HIV-1 and VSV-based pseudotyped viruses were somewhat less sensitive to neutralization than authentic SARS-CoV-2, particularly by weakly neutralizing plasma. This finding may be because they are single-cycle assays, or perhaps because pseudotyped virions may have lower spike density than SARS-CoV-2.",

Adaptation of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP in different target cells, that express different furin-like or other proteases may result in the acquisition of alternative adaptive mutations. Crucially, the sensitivity of the adapted rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies mimicked that of authentic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP appeared slightly more susceptible to plasma neutralization than SARS-CoV-2, for unknown reasons. Given that the design of rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP is similar to that of the successful VSV/EboV ebolavirus vaccine, derivatives of the adapted 1D7 or 2E1 viruses could potentially be vaccine candidates. Additionally, these viruses could also be used in laboratory selection experiments to identify mutations that enable escape from inhibition by antibodies or other therapeutic agents that target the spike protein.",
