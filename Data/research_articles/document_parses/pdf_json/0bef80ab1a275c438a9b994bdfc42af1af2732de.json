They also allow the survival, growth and transmission of bacteria such as Legionella, Mycobacteria and Vibrio species in water systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the co-occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and their associated bacteria in hospital water networks in Johannesburg, South Africa. A total of 178 water (n = 95) and swab (n = 83) samples were collected from two hospital water distribution systems. FLA were isolated using the amoebal enrichment technique and identified using PCR and 18S rDNA sequencing. Amoebae potentially containing intraamoebal bacteria were lysed and cultured on blood agar plates. Bacterial isolates were characterized using the VITEK\u00ae2 compact System. Free-living amoebae were isolated from 77 (43.3 %) of the samples. Using microscopy, PCR and 18S rRNA sequencing, Acanthamoeba spp. (T3 and T20 genotypes), Vermamoeba vermiformis and Naegleria gruberi specie were identified. The Acanthamoeba T3 and T20 genotypes have been implicated in eye and central nervous system infections. The most commonly detected bacterial species were Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Delftia acidovorans, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Comamonas testosteroni. These nosocomial pathogenic bacteria are associated with systematic blood, respiratory tract, the urinary tract, surgical wounds and soft tissues infections.

Among the protozoa, free-living amoebae (FLA) exist in high numbers in aquatic environments where they play a useful role as predators of micro-organisms, contributing to nutrient recycling by assimilating nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphate and releasing them into the environment by excretion (Taylor 1982; Rodriguez-Zaragoza 1994; Siddiqui and Khan 2012) .

Organisms mostly associated with HAIs such as Legionella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter spp., Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp. and Aspergillus spp. have been reported to coexist with FLA in the hospital environment (Thomas et al. 2006; Cateau et al. 2014; Lagan\u00e0 et al. 2014) . These organisms can infect and survive the exposure to oxygen radicals, the acidic environment and the lysosomal enzymes in the phagosomes of FLA. In addition to survival, some bacteria can multiply inside FLA (Greub and Raoul 2004; Lone et al. 2009; Siddiqui and Khan 2012) . Organisms in this category are collectively known as Bendocytobionts^ (Scheid 2014) . FLA may upregulate virulent genes of endocytobionts resulting in increased infectivity for human macrophages in vitro (Schmitz-Esser et al. 2008; Siddiqui and Khan 2012) . Furthermore, the interaction of amoebae with pathogenic endocytobionts can decrease the susceptibility of these pathogens to biocides mainly used to treat water in water systems (Miltner and Bermudez 2000; Coulon et al. 2010) . Regular monitoring of FLA and associated endocytobionts in hospital and other health care institutions is thus essential to manage and prevent possible exposure to patients, staff and members of the public who visit these institutions. In South Africa, contamination of hospital water supplies with waterborne pathogens has largely been overlooked.

(2010) reported the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. in 45 of the 94 (48 %) samples collected in different wards of hospitals in Iran. Two separate studies by the same research group in hospital environments also reported the presence of Acanthamoeba species in 47 of the 135 (34 %) samples collected (Carlesso et al. 2007 ) and 31 of the 135 (23 %) samples (Carlesso et al. 2010) . Studies in Tunisia and Egypt have also shown a high detection rate of 32.6-42.9 % of Acanthamoeba species in haemodialysis and dental waters (Dendana et al. 2008; Trabelsi et al. 2012; Hassan et al. 2012) . Generally, Acanthamoeba has been the most frequently isolated genera in tap water as they are easily identified morphologically compared to other FLA (Thomas et al. 2006; Co\u015fkun et al. 2013) . The low prevalence of the genus Acanthamoeba in our study relative to Vermamoeba can be attributed to the use of FLA common primers which might have been more effective in amplification of Vermamoeba rather that Acanthamoeba (Muchesa et al. 2015) . Several previous studies have shown that the T4 genotype to be connected with most Acanthamoeba infections and to be the most abundant in the hospital environment (Carlesso et al. 2010; Lasjerdi et al. 2011; Rahdar et al. 2012; Risler et al. 2013) . However, in our study, phylogenetic analysis identified Acanthamoeba isolates in hospital A (neonatal ward, neonatal ICU and paediatric diarrhoea ward) and hospital B (trauma ICU, endoscopy unit and theatre) that closely resembled the T3 genotype. This was relationship was supported by a bootstrap value of 18 %. The low support values may be because of more sequences to the data set analyzed, that is, the better your data, the lower the support values (Wheeler and Pickett 2008) . This means our bootstrap value may still be closer to a realistic one than other with higher figures, but few sequences. The other isolate from neurosurgical ICU of hospital B closely resembled the T20 genotype. The T3 genotype which includes A. griffin, A. pearcei and A. hatchetti has been associated with Acanthamoeba keratitis (Gonzalez-Robles et al. 2001; Visvesvara 2013) . A recent study in Iran also isolated the T3 genotype in tap water and swab samples of a high dependency unit that caters for haemato-oncology patients, showing its association with hospital water systems (Khurana et al. 2015) .

Our study has similarities with a study by Lagan\u00e0 et al. (2014) , on the occurrence of FLA and Gram-negative bacteria in an Italian hospital water system, where Vermamoeba spp. coexisted with S. paucimobili, P. fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter lwoffi, S. maltophilia and C. testosteroni. The endocytobiontic relationship in all bacteria detected in this study and amoebae has been described by several studies and reviews where bacteria have been demonstrated to survive or proliferate before being released into the environment by amoebae lysis or in amoebae vesicles (Pagnier et al. 2008; Saisongkorh et al. 2010; Thomas et al. 2010; Maschio et al. 2015) . Host-endozytobiont relationships in FLA allow FLA (mainly in cyst form) to form a physical barrier using the resistant cellulose cell walls, offering endozytobionts (bacteria) protection against adverse conditions such as extremes of temperature, UV light ozone, chlorine dioxide, monochloramine and copper-silver (Greub and Raoul 2004; Thomas et al. 2004; Bagheri et al. 2010 ). This can allow bacterial regrowth in the water system when environmental conditions are favourable (Coulon et al. 2010; Dupuy et al. 2014 ). In addition, low disinfectant concentrations in distribution networks have limited activity on FLA and also allow the formation of biofilms which enhances amoebae and bacteria persistence (Barbeau and Buhler 2001; Thomas et al. 2004) . Studies have also shown that passage through amoebae is likely to increase the virulence and antibiotic resistance of bacteria substantially, enabling them to prepare for subsequent survival in macrophages (Miltner and Bermudez 2000; Schmitz-Esser et al. 2008) . Furthermore, upregulation of virulent genes and horizontal transfer of genes can occur between the intracellular bacteria and their amoebae resulting in bacteria which are more resistant to human macrophages (Siddiqui and Khan 2012; Gomez-Valero and Buchrieser 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 216, "end": 236, "text": "Lagan\u00e0 et al.
