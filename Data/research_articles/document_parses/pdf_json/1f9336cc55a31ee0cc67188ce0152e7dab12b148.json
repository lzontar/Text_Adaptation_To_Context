In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with clinical course more than two months. This patient had recovered from the pneumonia after treatment. The viral RNA of throat swabs became negative and the viral specific antibodies were produced during recovery period. However, the viral RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days. In addition, the viral RNA was detected in multiple types of specimens with extremely high titers in the saliva.

Although the undetectable viral RNA might be caused by the low viral load or bias in sample collection of throat swab, the dynamic changes in viral titers showed that the host immunity suppressed the viral replication during this stage. However, the viral RNA reappeared in throat swab three days later. Logically, the three days of virus vanishment is too short to be an incubation period for a new infection, thus we deduced that the reappearance of the viral RNA was a recrudescence, rather than a new infection. The recrudescence persisted for more than 40 days, this is the longest persistence of recrudescence ever reported, to our knowledge. 5,6 In addition, the virus was detected in the multiple types of specimens including throat swab, salivary, and urine sediment; even though the antibodies targeting at the S protein had been produced. All of these results showed that the immune system had responded to the infection but it was incompetent to clear the viruses.",

After hospitalization, the patient received a low dose of methylprednisolone and oxygen therapies, as well as anti-infective therapy including ganciclovir, arbidol and moxifloxacin. His body temperature returned to normal and his symptoms resolved within one week. The CT scan revealed a significant improvement in pulmonary infection and the throat swab became negative (Ct > 40) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on February 20 (Fig.1). Then he continued to receive consolidated treatment including traditional Chinese medicine, while methylprednisolone and oxygen therapies were removed. As preparation for discharge, the patient was retested for viral RNA. However, a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA reappeared in the throat swab on February 23 and remained high (Ct at around 30) in the following four tests before March 15. During this period, the patient remained asymptomatic and had no This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Accepted Article abnormal signs. His body temperature kept below 36.5\u00b0C, and SpO2 remained above 97%. The chest CT scan showed the infection lesion had been absorbed and the lungs returned to normal on March 12. In addition, the serological SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM and IgG, targeting at S and N proteins) were detected on March 11. In order to actively inhibit the virus replication, interferon nebulization, thymalfasin, and chloroquine diphosphate were sequentially initiated since March 8, according to the Chinese guideline on the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (trial version 7). However, the viral RNA remained positive in throat swab, saliva and urine sediment (it was negative in urine) on March 13. Particularly, an extremely high level of viral RNA (Ct=18.7) was detected in saliva. The patient was transferred to another hospital for centralized management and treatment since March 15. Positive throat swabs (without Ct value) were reported on March 22 and April 2.DiscussionUp to the end of data collection, the clinical course of this patient had lasted for more than 70 days. To the best of our knowledge, this are the longest reported duration of clinical course in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.4 Although we presented a solo case in this study, there are still about 3,000 patients hospitalized in Wuhan city by April 1, and many of them were infected at the early stage of the outbreak in December 2019.
