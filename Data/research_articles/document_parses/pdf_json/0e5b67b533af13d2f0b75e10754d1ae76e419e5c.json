            "text": "In this paper, we propose a different approach based on the compressed sensing theory [4] [3] [10] for detection of viruses and antibodies using pooled sample testing. In compressed sensing, the measurement reading is not just a binary reading ('positive' or 'negative') as in group testing, but instead the measurement reading of compressed sensing can be real-numbered quantification of the quantity of target DNA in the pooled sample. The traditional group testing methods such as [11] can be thought of as special cases of the more powerful compressed sensing framework proposed in this paper. This is because the measurement reading of group testing is a binary reduction of the real-numbered quantification of compressed sensing. Through compressed sensing, it is possible to test n persons for viruses by only using O(k log(n)) samples, where k is the number of virusinfected persons. This is a significant reduction compared with testing each individual person, which would require n testing. This can translate into an increase of test throughput in the order of n/(k log(n)), which can be quite significant if the number of infected people is much smaller than the total population. Indeed, the real-numbered quantification from compressed sensing can greatly help speed up the testing of viruses and reduce the cost of testing, by taking advantage of the sparsity of virus infections in the population. Compared with conventional group testing (including non-adaptive and adaptive group testing), compressed sensing has the following advantages: (1) Compressed sensing uses real-numbered quantitative measurement results (quantification of target DNA etc. ) to infer virus infections or antibodies. These measurement readings contain more information about the collected samples than the binary readings of group testing. This will make inference from compressed sensing measurements more robust against noises an outliers in the measurements, and require fewer tests.",

By monitoring reactions during the exponential amplification phase of the reaction, users can determine the initial quantity of the target with great precision.

The number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold is called the threshold cycle (C t ) or, quantification cycle (C q ). One can then use this threshold cycle C t to determine the quan-tity of target DNA in the sample. In ideal cases, if the threshold cycle of a DNA sample A precedes that of another sample B by N cycles, then this DNA sample A contains 2 N times more target DNAs than DNA sample B at the beginning of the reaction.

(It is also possible that we can collect more than 1 sample from a person, but for simplicity of presentations, we stick with 1 sample per person.) We use a non-negative vector x \u2208 R n to denote the quantities of COVID-19 viruses in the samples of these n persons, where x i , the i-th element of x, corresponds to the quantity of target DNA in the sample of the i-th person, and R is the set of real numbers. If the i-th person is not infected or has no COVID-19 virus, x i = 0 or very close to 0; if instead the i-th person is infected, x i > 0. If there are k (k can be small compared with n) people affected among these n persons, x will have k positive elements, and the rest of its elements are zero. This leads to a sparse x, and we call such a vector k-sparse vector, meaning it only has k nonzero elements. When the vector x is sparse, compressed sensing theories offer to greatly reduce the number of testings that need to be done to accurately infer x [3] [10] . This implies high-throughput, fast and low-cost testing for detecting viruses. The basic idea of compressed sensing is to observe mixed or pooled samples of elements of x through a wide measurement matrix (as introduced below). Compared with group testing, compressed sensing can correctly infer the realnumbered values of x (which will be useful for research of different phases of infections, better diagnosis, treatment of infected persons), requires fewer testing to detect positive cases, and is more robust against noisy observations.",

In this paper, we focus on the RT-PCR, and assume it is ideal in the sense that the quantity of DNA sample inferred from its readings is f (Ax) = Ax. Compared with group testing, in our compressed sensing systems, the output y can work with real numbers or other general formats such as the whole amplication plot of qPCR, and can glean more information from each test (or measurement) than binary information. Since compressed sensing can retain more information about the vector x, in general fewer tests are needed for inferring x or the support of x.

We take n = 40 and k = 2, and the number of measurements is taken as m = 5, 6,7,8, 9, and 10 . For each set of (m, n, k), we run 10 trials. In each trial, the pooling 10 matrix is a Bernoulli random matrix. The measurement result is contaminated with random noise normalized to have a magnitude of 10 \u22123 . A trial is considered to have successful recovery if the recovery error is less than 10 \u22122 in the noisy case. In exhaustive search, since the true signal has sparsity of k, we will simply perform brute force calculations over all the possible sets of k infected persons. For each possible such set of cardinality k, we extract the corresponding columns from the measurement matrix. By doing this, we get an overdetermined system, and solve it via the least squares method. There are totally n k possible such sets, which means we need to solve the least square n k times for each trial. The results are shown in Figure 11 . As we can see, using only 10 measurements, the false positive rate and false negative rates are very low (in fact 0 in this experiment). That amounts to a factor of 40 10 = 4 speedup in throughput of the test. We now look at the testing data of COVID-19 viruses from the state of Iowa. The rate of testing positive is around 8.7 percent by early April, meaning among all the tests carried out, 8.7 percent of them came back with a 'positive' result. We consider a microplate of 96 wells, and assume that the PCR machine can analyze 96 samples in one operational period. Then we do a computational experiment to answer, \"using compressed sensing, for how many people these 96 compressed sensing (pooling) samples can correctly identify all the carriers of viruses present in that group of people?\" In this experiment, we fix the number of measurements, namely m, as 96. Then we vary the number of people n, and randomly pick 8.7 percent of them (namely k = ceil(0.087n), where ceil(\u00b7) is the ceiling function) as virus carriers. We accordingly generate the virus quantity vector x. We plot the successful recovery rate of x, the false positive rate and false negative rate as functions of n in Figure 12 . As n increases, there are more virus carriers, and false positive rates and false negative rates are expected to increase when m = 96 is fixed. We observe that for n \u2264 300, these false positive rates and false negative rates stay very low. This means that, when 8.7 percent of people have viruses, using compressed sensing, the throughput of testing can grow to as much as 300 96 \u2248 3 times. For both Bernoulli random matrices and expander graph based matrices with 7 '1's in one column, we observe similar behaviors. When the percent of people carrying viruses decreases, say to 1 percent, compressed sensing can even increase the throughput by more than 10 times. 10 ",
