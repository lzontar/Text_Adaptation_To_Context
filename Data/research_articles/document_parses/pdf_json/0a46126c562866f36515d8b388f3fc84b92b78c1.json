Between October 2013 and March 2018, eight scoliotic patients with extremely large Cobb angle and profoundly limited flexibility underwent UniVATS for anterior release, followed by posterior instrumentation and fusion.

Our case of TOF exemplifies the safety and feasibility of this technique.

Less access trauma of UniVATS together with intercostal nerve blockade make narcotic-free recovery possible in our institute.
