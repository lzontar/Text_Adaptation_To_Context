However, transmission of pathogens is one of the biggest risks of transfusion of labile blood components. Therefore, a key mission of blood transfusion services is to provide safe blood and blood products. Screening of blood products has reduced the spread of known blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). 1,2 However, other known or unknown pathogens pose a threat to the blood supply with regional differences that is difficult to address. The number of pathogens screened in blood banks is limited by the number of blood screening assays that are commercially available. Therefore, pathogen inactivation offers an appealing alternative to blood screening (serology or nucleic acid testing [NAT] ) because of its proactive nature and the broad spectrum of protection it offers without a priori characterization of unknown pathogens. Indeed, pathogen inactivation technologies have been developed to provide safe blood products while reducing the need for the implementation of additional screening assays. 3 The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic pathogen that is endemic in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012. 4 As of February 24, 2017, MERS-CoV has been responsible for 1905 confirmed infections including 677 deaths (approx. 35.5% mortality rate) in 27 countries. 5 Most cases (1552 confirmed infections) were reported in Saudi Arabia with a mortality rate of approximately 41.9%. 6 MERS-CoV causes respiratory illness in humans varying from asymptomatic or mild to severe pneumonia. 4, 7 The elderly and patients suffering from comorbidities are the most at risk for death outcome after development of severe clinical symptoms such as severe pneumonia and extrapulmonary manifestations. 8 The major route of transmission for MESR-CoV is via droplets, fomites, and person-to-person contact through the respiratory system as well as via direct or indirect contact with zoonotic sources. So far, most MERS cases are linked to residence in or travel to Saudi Arabia. 9 Several hospital and household outbreaks have been reported in Saudi Arabia as well as South Korea due to nosocomial transmission and close contact with patients. 9,10 However, the number of asymptomatic cases is estimated to be much higher than the reported cases, 11 which together with mild cases may increase the spread of the virus and pose a significant risk for blood safety. Indeed, presymptomatic and asymptomatic donors may be allowed to donate blood while their donation has the potential to carry the virus, although there is no report on MERS-CoV detection in blood from presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients. While most of the reported MERS-CoV cases were due to human-to-human transmissions especially under inadequate infection control measures, dromedary camels are believed to be the reservoir host and an important source of human infection. 9, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Specifically, primary or index cases that had no contact history with infected individuals are more likely to have had direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. Interestingly, current regulations of blood donation do not consider recent history of contact with dromedaries as a reason for deferral of blood donation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 940, "end": 945, "text": "[NAT]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1257, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1431, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1587, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1704, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1806, "end": 1808, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1810, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2011, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2286, "end": 2287, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2554, "end": 2556, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3152, "end": 3154, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3155, "end": 3159, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3160, "end": 3164, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3165, "end": 3169, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3170, "end": 3174, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3175, "end": 3179, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3180, "end": 3184, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESULTS:"}, {"text": "MERS-CoV has been detected in a variety of samples from infected patients including respiratory samples, serum, plasma, urine, and stool.

[20] [21] [22] This is reminiscent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak which started in China in 2003 and led to global human-tohuman spread with more than 8000 confirmed cases and approximately 10% death rate. During the SARS outbreak, viral RNA was detected in serum from several patients but no transfusion-associated transmission was reported. 23, 24 While SARS-CoV disappeared quickly, MERS-CoV continues to be endemic in the Arabian Peninsula for more than 4 years now. Similar to SARS-CoV, there is no proven evidence so far of transfusion-transmitted MERS-CoV infections, 25 but the presence of viral RNA in plasma and serum of acute patients raises this concern especially in endemic areas like Saudi Arabia. In fact, it is not known whether presence of viral RNA in blood products could lead to transmission of MERS-CoV or not.

Although such specific pathogen screening and testing of blood products have significantly reduced transfusion-related infections, transmission of wellrecognized pathogens such as HIV, HBV, and HCV is still being reported in many parts of the world. 39, 40 Furthermore, emerging and/or reemerging pathogens which are usually of zoonotic nature pose a high risk for blood safety. 41 The unpredictable nature of such outbreaks and the erratic dynamics of their spread represent a challenging hurdle to preparedness plans and implementation of safety measures. A recent example is the emergence of Zika virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is transmissible through blood transfusion. 42 Outbreaks of coronaviruses with high mortality in humans have been described for SARS-CoV in China and Southeast Asia 23,24 and MERS-CoV in the Middle East and South Korea. 9 The detection of viral RNA in the blood of patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV suggests a potential risk for their transmission through transfusion. [21] [22] [23] [24] During a MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, levels of viral load ranged from 3.3 to 4.2 log genomic copies/mL in whole blood and from 2.7 to 4.0 log genomic copies/mL in serum, 21 while another study reported up to 6 logs of RNA copies/mL in serum from infected individuals. 20 That corresponds to an approximate infectious titer of less than 1.2 log in whole blood and less than 3 logs in serum according to our data which shows 3-log difference between genomic and infectious titers (Tables 1 and 2 ). Using IBS, we were able to show a mean reduction of 4.67 6 0.25 log in MERS-CoV infectious titers (ranging from 4.51 to 5.04) in plasma (Table 1 ) which is approximately 1.5 logs higher than the minimum reduction titer recommended by the European Committee of Blood Transfusion, 43 suggesting an inactivation capacity of MERS-CoV in plasma with a high safety margin. In contrast to the infectious titer, the genomic titer was only affected slightly by the pathogen inactivation treatment ( Table 2 ). The amotosalen/UVA process effectively crosslinks nucleic acids, but does not break the strands. Therefore, to ensure that there are no remaining amounts of infectious virus particles, the collected supernatants were passaged three times after inactivation for 3 days. The absence of CPE even after 7 days of incubation in cultures inoculated with the posttreatment samples suggests that there is no infectious MERS-CoV remaining in these samples. No viral genomes were detected in the supernatant of cell cultures inoculated with posttreatment samples even after multiple passages mostly due to nonreplicating viral genome and degradation of viral RNA during the incubation period. This is in contrast to the pretreatment and the positive control samples that showed a high level of viral RNA after incubation in all three passages.
