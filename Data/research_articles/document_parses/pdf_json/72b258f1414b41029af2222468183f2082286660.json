At what appears to be the tail end of the first wave of the pandemic in Switzerland, about one in ten people have developed detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, despite the fact that it was one of the more heavily affected areas in Europe. 15 Thus, assuming that the presence of the IgG antibodies measured in this study is, at least in the short term, associated with protection, these results highlight that the vast majority of the population is still immunologically naive to this new virus. We found that young children (5-9 years) and older people (\u226565 years) had significantly lower seroprevalence than the other age groups. A single positive young child out of 123 in our sample suggests that infection was less prevalent in children than in adolescents and adults during this epidemic. These results are consistent with a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that young children are both infected and develop severe disease less often than adults, but much uncer tainty remains. [16] [17] [18] [19] Although this might provide new insights for worldwide debates around opportunity and modality of schools reopening, the post-infection immune response in children is not clear. Of note, our ELISA test was validated in an adultonly population; whether the IgG response in children is delayed or qualitatively different needs to be further investigated. Furthermore, we only included children aged 5 years and older and immuno logical responses and suscep tibility to infection might be different in younger children. More studies are needed to better understand infection and antibody dynamics among young children. The lower seropreva lence estimates among older adults are a sign that targeted efforts to reduce social mixing of these people with others might have succeeded. However, it remains possible that older adults develop a lower IgG response after infectionsomething that needs further investigation. 20 Over the course of the 5 study weeks, we observed an increase in seroprevalence from about 5% to about 11%, which is to be expected considering time to seroconversion after symptoms (median 10\u00b74 days [IQR 8\u00b71-13\u00b74]) and that the peak of the epidemic was reached the week before the start of our survey (appendix p 8).

Recruitment of participants by email might exclude less technologyproficient individuals or people without access to email. To address this, we started contacting those without a valid email address by postal mail during week 4 of the study, inviting them to provide us with an email address or to book an appointment by phone. Another study led by the Geneva University Hospitals in Geneva specifically targeting vulnerable populations (socially and clinically) is ongoing. Confirmatory testing using plaque reduction neutralisation after ELISAs is standard practice when tests are being used to make decisions about an individual person. However, this was not done in our study because our aim was to have an unbiased estimate of the proportion of sampled people who have been infected, 21 not to perfectly identify each specific person who had been previously infected (and mounted a specific antibody response). With careful charac terisation of the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA, we could adjust for false positives and negatives when making population-level inferences. Furthermore, all positive and indeterminate samples were further confirmed through recombined immunofluorescence assay developed inhouse in the laboratory of virology of the Geneva University Hospitals (WHO Swiss reference lab). 10 Finally, although a preliminary participation rate of 30-40% remains good for a population-based survey with on-site visits, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown, we note that selection bias might have affected our results. Indeed, it is possible that participants who experienced COVID-19-like symptoms, or those that were less confined during lockdown (eg, people who are not part of a risk group) were more likely to take part in the study, potentially leading to overestimation of our prevalence estimates. However, this might have been counterbalanced by the fact that we recruited participants with higher educational level than that of the Geneva population, whereas COVID-19 seems to show a striking social gradient with the socioeconomically disadvantaged groups being disproportionately affected. 22, 23 Over the coming weeks, we will continue to monitor seroprevalence in the general population and are planning to do more detailed analyses taking into account symptomatology and sociodemographic factors to better understand transmission and risk within households and the general community. However, a preliminary presentation of these results is deemed to be necessary to inform global policy makers in a timely manner on how to adapt planning of the next phases. Our estimates of seroprevalence in Geneva are consistent with preliminary reports from other regions across the world showing that only a minority of the population, even in some of the hardest hit areas, has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic wave. 24, 25 When combined with local epidemiological data, age-specific seroprevalence estimates can lead to robust estimates of the infection fatality risk, a measure of the severity of infection, which is crucial for weighing the risks and benefits of different post-lockdown strategies. Our estimate of the ratio of confirmed cases to infections, using data from a population-representative sample, although not fully generalisable to all settings, provides a rough benchmark for translating observed cases to the total number of infections. Furthermore, our observation of lower seroprevalence among young children and older adults has important implications. Although the interpretation of these findings requires further research, existing evidence suggests that the low prevalence in children might indeed be indicative of lower susceptibility to infection. 26, 27 In older adults, it might be the result of a com bination of lower exposure (because of stronger social distancing) and immune system ageing. Because this is the age group that is most susceptible to severe disease and has the highest fatality risk, the question of the opportunity and consequences of softening distancing measures for this population remains open.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1264, "end": 1266, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1793, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2607, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2608, "end": 2610, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3341, "end": 3344, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3345, "end": 3347, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 4201, "end": 4204, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 4205, "end": 4207, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our results highlight that, although the number of hospital admissions has reduced in Geneva and other similar locations throughout the world, the immunological landscape has not changed greatly since the pandemic onset, with most people having no evidence of past infection.
