Predictive factors of mortality were 24 studied. Mean age was 75.3, mean oxygen (O 2 ) requirements 10.4 l/min. At baseline, all patients 25 had multiple biological abnormalities (lymphopenia, increased CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer 26 and liver enzymes). 24 patients (70.5%) recovered after TCZ therapy and 10 died (29.5%). 27 Deceased subjects differed from patients in whom treatment was effective with regard to more 28 pronounced lymphopenia (0.6 vs 1.0 G/l; p=0.037), lower platelet number (156 vs 314 G/l; 29 p=0.0001), lower fibrinogen serum level (0.6 vs 1.0 G/l; p=0.03), higher aspartate-amino-30 transferase (108 vs 57 UI/l; p=0.05) and greater O 2 requirements (11 vs 8 l/min; p= 0.003).",

On March 11 th , 2020, COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the 44 World Health Organization (1). Data from China, the cradle of the pandemic, pointed out that 45 older and frail patients may develop severe disease with respiratory distress and multi-organ 46 failure, resulting in death in about 4% of the cases (2). Acute respiratory distress syndrome 47 (ARDS) related to SARS-CoV-2 is likely due to a cytokine dysregulation, occurring during the 48 second week of the disease. This cytokine \"storm\" is characterized by a major release of pro-49 inflammatory cytokines, including interleukine-6 (IL-6), IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony- 50 stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon \u03b3 inducible protein (IP10) and tumor necrosis factor\u03b1 (2-4). 51 Blocking this excessive cytokine production might be the key of the COVID-19-ARDS treatment. 52 Elevated IL-6 levels, correlated with clinical severity, were found in patients with other cytokine 53 release syndrome (CRS) (5). Remarkable beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade therapy using a 54 humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ) were observed in patients with CRS 55 due to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (6). Many reports underlined the major interest 56 of TCZ, and other cytokine blockade, in the treatment of the COVID-19 related CRS (2, 4, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . 57 Due to increasing evidence that TCZ might reduce mortality in patients with COVID-19 related 58 CRS, a scientific committee was constituted within the Nord Franche-Comt\u00e9 (NFC) Hospital on 59 the very last days of March 2020. The committee, including infectious diseases specialists, 60 rheumatologists, pharmacists and intensivists, proposed to authorize the off-label use of TCZ in 61 patients who were developing ARDS with rapid increase of O 2 requirements (i.e. exceeding 5 62 liter / minute with high concentration mask), after failure of a treatment including 63 hydroxychloroquine and/or IV corticosteroids, still within the window of opportunity for TCZ 64 treatment (day 7 to day 17 after onset of symptoms). To be eligible for TCZ therapy each case 65 had to be discussed during a daily multidisciplinary consultation meeting (MCM) including 66 infectious diseases specialists rheumatologist, pharmacists, biologists and intensivists. Between 67 April 1 st and May 11 th , 2020, 40 severe COVID-19 patients were treated with TCZ in our hospital. 68 Contraindications for TCZ were bacterial superinfection, latent tuberculosis infection, 69 macrophage activation syndrome and hypersensitivity to tocilizumab. 70 We have recently published a retrospective case-control study on our first sample of patients 71 treated with TCZ (16). Despite a Charlson comorbidity index higher than that of patients from 72 the control group, more severe disease, higher oxygen requirement and poorer biological 73 findings, patients treated with TCZ had a better prognosis than control with a death rate of 25% 74 and 48% respectively. However the percentage of deceased patients remains rather high and 75 justifies looking for the reasons of the treatment failure in about 1 patient out of 4. 76 The aim of the present work was to identify prognostic factors of mortality in subjects treated 77 with TCZ for COVID-19 severe pneumonia, in order to better select further patients, and (i.e. amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or cefotaxime or levofloxacin), hydroxychloroquine (800 mg/day 92 at day 1, then 400 mg/day from day 2 to day 10), enoxaparin at anticoagulant dose and 93 paracetamol (1 to 3 g/d). Some of them received IV methylprednisolone at a dosing regimen of 94 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day, 1 to 5 consecutive days. 95 All patients received oxygen therapy, using high concentration mask. The oxygen flow was 96 calculated to obtain oxygen saturation between 92 and 96%. Oxygen saturation was measured 97 every 4 hours using a digital saturometer. ",

In the 149 remaining 34 patients, unsurprisingly, there was an overwhelming majority of males (24 males 150 vs 10 females). The average (SD) age was 75.3 (11.4) ranging from 52 to 93. At time of the first 151 TCZ injection, the mean oxygen requirement was 10.4 l/min ranging from 4 to 15 l/min.

It was 153 unrelated to oxygen requirement (p=0.89), lymphocytes number (p= 0.38), hemoglobin (p= 154 0.62), ferritin (p= 0.46), CRP (p= 0.29), ALT (p= 0.29), AST (p=0.33), D-dimer (p= 0.90), 155 prothrombin (p= 0.42), fibrinogen (p= 0.22) and LDH (p= 0.67).

The between group difference was not 173 significant for gender, ferritin, CRP, D-dimer and the other studied biomarkers (all p>0.05).174 Pretreatment with hydroxychloroquine (9/10 patients in the death group and 19/24 in the 175 recovery group) was unrelated to TCZ result. Patients who recovered were as frequently treated 176 with IV corticosteroids than those in whom treatment failed (10/24 vs 6/10). Moreover, there 177 was no between group difference in methylprednisolone dose (mean dose 259 mg ; range 120-178 480 mg in the Death group versus 333 mg ; range 120-840 mg in the Recovery group). Response 179 to treatment was unrelated to the extent of lung lesions on CT-scan (> or <50%) (p=0.88) and to 180 the time since onset of symptoms (p=0.54). In multivariate analysis we identified 3 independent 181 factors of mortality: lymphopenia, platelets number and AST (p=0.series of patients treated with TCZ for SARS-CoV-2 severe pneumonia is, to our knowledge, the first one specifically focusing on the predictive factors of mortality. Despite the 186 small sample size, it gives some interesting information especially on the profile of patients who 187 may or may not benefit from IL-6 blockade therapy. Patients who recovered were slightly 188 younger -about 7 years-than those in whom treatment failed, although good results have been 189 obtained in several patients older than 85. The biological inflammatory syndrome was slightly 190 more marked in the \"Recovery\" group, as demonstrated by higher fibrinogen serum levels and 191 higher platelet count. This confirms the rationale of using an IL-6 targeted therapy, well known 192 for its powerful anti-inflammatory effect. Surprisingly baseline CRP was not predictive of 193 response to therapy, conversely to what has been shown in RA (23). Patients with higher AST 194 levels and those severe lymphopenia, both predictors of mortality (20), were less likely to 195 benefit from TCZ. High ferritin levels, that have been shown to be a prognostic factor for 196 mortality in patients with COVID-19 (20), were not identified as a biomarker of poor prognostic 197in our study. Surprisingly, we did not found any relationship between response to treatment and 198 lung lesions extent. The lack of correlation between response to TCZ and time since onset of 199 symptoms can be explained by the criteria of eligibility to treatment that stipulates patients 200 must be within the \"window of opportunity\" (24). Our case series suffers from some 201 limitations. The sample size was probably too small to determine \"cut-off values\", which would 202 allow precise identification of patients to be treated with high chances of success. All patients 203 were treated within a short period of time, considered as the best \"window of opportunity\" for 204 TCZ treatment (i.e. day 7 to 17), and we do not have information on the benefit to treat earlier and/or too severe comorbidities. So we cannot draw a conclusion for the interest of TCZ",
