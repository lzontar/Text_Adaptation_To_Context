To infer M, N and P, Bayesian updating with a Binomial likelihood function was used, taking into account the actual number of cases and denominators corresponding to each age group. M, N and P were sampled from their posterior distributions by using importance sampling; 10,000 parameter sets for both were drawn from uniform distributions and then resampled with replacement at a probability for each sample weighted by the likelihood of that parameter set. To determine the range of the uniform distribution, sampling was first conducted over very broad priors, constructed from the distributions in Table S1 below. After resampling, the ranges of parameters in the resampled sets were then determined -these ranges were more likely to contain parameter sets with a high likelihood of fitting data. We hence sampled a second time from uniform distributions over these ranges to obtain our final posterior distributions. These data were then combined to estimate the risk of ICU admission in infected patients using the following formula: P(admitted to ICU | infected) = P(hospitalised | infected) x P(admitted to ICU | reported case) / P(hospitalised | reported case)",

This reporting delay means that, on any particular day, the data available on onset cases will exclude those cases which have onset but have not yet been reported. We therefore see only a portion of the true epidemic curve. It is possible to adjust for this bias by nowcasting -using the delay we have observed for already reported cases to estimate how many additional, onset-not-yet-reported cases are ongoing at any point in time. Particularly early on in the epidemic when incidence is increasing exponentially, the observed delay distribution will be biased downwards since only patients with shorter delays will already have been reported to the system. As time goes on and we observe enough of the epidemic to capture the longest reasonable delay, this bias will diminish and the delays can be estimated directly but will likely have changed from the early delays.",

Decreasing effort in maintaining the dataset also likely contributed to the tailing-off of reported cases in the FF100; whether due to delay or poor completion, some cases reported on those days will never be added to this dataset. This would bias counts of CC admissions which is one reason why the only counts up to 6 March in the FF100 were used for model fitting; however for the delay distribution we used all patients with a date of reporting for CC admission up to the last complete dataset (31 March).",
