This fact appears to be little known, in part because apart from a handful of prior studies (Mason et al. 2011; Reuschke 2016) , entrepreneurial homeworking has been largely neglected as a research topic. This neglect is surprising for several reasons. First, homeworking influences entrepreneurs' ability to serve lucrative markets and scale their businesses by hiring workers. Hence, it bears on entrepreneurial performance. Second, homeworking carries implications for understanding who participates in entrepreneurship. This is of interest to researchers concerned with the drivers of entrepreneurial selection. Third, the joint emergence of high-tech occupations and the decline of \"traditional\" employment provided by large employers make homeworking a topical alternative mode of employment. There is considerable policy interest in discovering more about the prevalence of homeworking in the new digital economy (Blount 2015; Huws et al. 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 530, "end": 549, "text": "(Mason et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 550, "end": 564, "text": "Reuschke 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1371, "text": "(Blount 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1389, "text": "Huws et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Moreover, uncovering the determinants of entrepreneurial homeworking can inform several prominent areas of entrepreneurship research. These include how entrepreneurs manage work-life balance, where they locate their ventures, and how public policy influences entry into entrepreneurship.

While much research has emphasized the importance of variations in work hours for achieving flexibility, the potential role of homeworking in this regard (whereby entrepreneurs can quickly switch between performing home and work duties) has been rather neglected.

In addition, many employees expect standard working conditions and hours, and access to standard office resources which may be lacking in somebody else's home.

In contrast, homeworking is cheap and involves little cost in setting up.

We turn next to the primary research question, which is whether homeworking is a transitory state for fledgling businesses. As noted in the \"Is homeworking a transitional state?\" section, if that is the case, one might expect numerous hybrid entrepreneurs to transition into homeworking from year to year. To check whether this notion gains empirical support, Table 4 presents the year-to-year transition matrix for hybrid and non-hybrid entrepreneurs, calculated by pooling every wave of the sample. The table shows that, among non-hybrid entrepreneurs, there are relatively high annual transition rates (11-17%) between homeworking and non-homeworking. In contrast, virtually no hybrid entrepreneurs make transitions into homeworking-or even out of hybrid status. Hence, homeworking does not seem to be a risk-minimization strategy for hybrid entrepreneurs, casting doubt on the notion that homeworking is an entry point for entrants using this strategy. As a side note, the low rate of transitions out of hybrid entrepreneurship and into fulltime entrepreneurship (1.8%) is striking, and contrast Continuing with the question of whether homeworking is a transitory haven for fledgling businesses, we next tested Hypotheses 4a and 4b. To that end, we estimated a probit model with two dependent variables-(1) nonhomeworking self-employed who are employing others, and (2) Non-homeworking self-employed with business partners. In accordance with the phrasing of Hypotheses 4a and 4b, last year's homeworking status was included as the main independent variable. Table 5 presents the results. We start with model (4), which reveals that the previous year's homeworking status is positively related to the homeworking status in the current year (p < 0.001). Thus, self-employed homeworkers are significantly more likely to remain in this state than to transition to non-homeworking status. Strikingly, model (5) indicates that the previous year's homeworking status without employing others is negatively related to current non-homeworking status while employing others (p < 0.001). Hence, we reject Hypothesis 4a, and infer that homeworking is not merely a temporary repository of businesses that subsequently hire employees and transition to non-home-based locations. Along similar lines, model (6) indicates that the previous year's homeworking status without business partners is negatively related to current nonhomeworking status with business partners (p < 0.001).

First, we tested a probit model using stabilized weights to account for possible selection bias associated with the self-employed differing from other workers based on a set of observables. To this end, we calculated inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) to control for selection on observables (Azoulay et al. 2009; Fewell et al. 2004 ). We defined self-employed individuals as the treated group and employed individuals as the control group and computed stabilized weights for the members of both groups. Finally, we re-ran the pooled probit regression model using stabilized weights. We repeated this procedure for total sample, male subsample, and female subsample. Table 6 displays the estimates of the pooled probit model using stabilized weights. Model (7) presents findings for the total sample, while models (8) and (9) present the findings for the male and female subsamples, respectively. Hypothesis 1, which predicted a negative relationship between being an employer and homeworking, continues to receive support-for all three samples (p < 0.001). Likewise, Hypothesis 2a, which predicted a negative relationship between business partnerships and homeworking, continues to receive support for male subsample (p < 0.05)-as does the weaker relationship for females (Hypothesis 2b). However, we discern no significant relationship between caregiving responsibilities of disabled family member and dependent child and propensity to choose homeworking, for all three samples. Therefore, Hypotheses 3a and 3b are not supported in our robustness checks. Also, once we control for sample selection, being a homeowner is negatively related to homeworking overall and for the female self-employed subsample. Perhaps female homeowners are wealthier than female non-homeowners and wealthier females can afford office rent for their own business, which is related to their decision to eschew homeworking. For the female subsample, the number of rooms in house is positively related to homeworking, which seems intuitive. Second, we tested whether interaction variables of different items related to caregiving responsibilities are related to the homeworking decision of entrepreneurs.

If it did, one might expect to observe numerous \"hybrid\" entrepreneurs, who work primarily in paid employment practicing selfemployment as a second job, transitioning into full-time non-homeworking self-employment. We would also expect to observe entrepreneurs who take on employees and business partners to transition away from homeworking and into non-home-based businesses.

However, to our surprise, we detected no significant relationship between providing caregiving to disabled family members and self-employed homeworking among our respondents, including for the female sample. The lack of a significant association between caregiving of disabled family members and self-employed homeworking seems to fly in the face of prior theorizing and previous empirical findings. One possibility is that self-employment provides enough flexibility in the British context to enable entrepreneurs to discharge their caregiving obligations to disabled family members, such that homeworking confers no additional advantages in this regard.

The present article has identified homeworking as a hitherto overlooked explanation for limited job creation. Homeworking can help explain the limited scale of most entrepreneurial ventures (Davidsson et al. 2009; Hurst and Pugsley 2011) and their surprisingly limited growth ambitions (Delmar and Wiklund 2008; Wiklund and Shepherd 2003) . The logistical difficulties of operating a multiperson venture from a domestic property, together with the agency costs entailed by spatially separating employees from the entrepreneur owner-manager, could account for incompatibility between entrepreneurial homeworking and job creation.

If self-employed homeworkers earn less on average than their non-homeworker counterparts, e.g., because of a positive \"compensating differential\" derived from working at home, then this might explain part of the puzzle. The idea behind the compensating differential is that a pleasant non-financial feature of a working arrangement (e.g., being based at home) can compensate for lower financial remuneration, thereby inducing some entrepreneurs to take low-income business opportunities which they might otherwise forgo. Consistent with this logic, some income calculations by the authors using the BHPS revealed a much greater pre-tax earnings penalty for homeworker self-employed than for non-homeworker self-employed. These calculations used data on pre-tax earnings, and computed averages for paid employees, homeworker selfemployed, and non-homeworker self-employed. They revealed that the average pre-tax earnings penalty of all self-employed relative to employees was \u00a3240 per month, whereas self-employed homeworkers earned on average \u00a3738 per month less than the nonhomeworker self-employed (all amounts in 2008 prices). In fact, were one to remove homeworkers from the self-employed sample, the \u00a3240 per month selfemployment penalty relative to employees would be turned into a \u00a358 per month premium.

This Budget announcement followed a pledge by Prime Minister Johnson that every home would have access to the next generation of Internet technology by 2025. This type of infrastructure investment, which is rolling out in many other countries as well, is likely to increase the ease with which techbased businesses can be operated at home, especially given continued growth in the number of Internet-based ventures (and possibly also in response to the Covid-19 pandemic).

More research is needed on this topic, in part to inform entrepreneurs and policymakers, and in part to build out scholarly understanding of entrepreneurship. Its prevalence alone makes it deserve of further attention; but one can also imagine a whole set of questions which researchers can explore anew by distinguishing between homeworker and non-homeworker entrepreneurs. For example, are borrowing constraints different for the two groups of entrepreneurs, and are the growth and survival prospects of their ventures different too? How does the growing trend of flexible \"gig economy\" working and multiple job holding (Adams et al. 2018) intersect with homeworking among the self-employed, and what are the likely directions this may take in the future? What are the regional impacts of homeworking in terms of economic development and living standards? These are all interesting questions which the homeworker distinction open up for fresh investigation, and which promise to generate further unexpected and fruitful insights.
