An aging population has led to more complex comorbidities and frailty among patients who require orthopaedic treatment. This has been recognised previously in patients sustaining hip fractures and has given rise to a drive for optimisation of these patients in the form of national guidelines and the Best Practice Tariff (BPT) for hip fractures. [1] Initiatives such as a comprehensive geriatric assessment prior to surgery and time to surgery within 36 hours have improved care and reduced mortality. [2] Over the past decade, there has been an increased recognition of poor outcomes amongst other orthopaedic trauma patient cohorts [3, 4] . In response, policymakers have gradually expanded their guidelines to include additional fracture patterns, demographic inclusions, and care recommendations (Table 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 462, "end": 465, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 618, "end": 621, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 750, "end": 753, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 754, "end": 756, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 916, "end": 925, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "However, with this ever-expanding inclusion criteria for comprehensive multi-disciplinary care, can our current healthcare resources provide this increasingly high standard of care for frail and older orthopaedic patients?

With increased demand for geriatric services, recruitment initiatives have been developed to encourage more trainees to consider the specialty. These initiatives need to tackle the perception that geriatricians take on a disproportionate burden of acute illness. [6] More geriatricians are required to provide for our aging population. [7] Despite the increasing demand for geriatricians, it is difficult to recruit to vacant consultant posts, with only a third of advertised positions being filled at interview, as there is a lack of appropriate candidates. As geriatric medicine is more developed in the UK compared to other countries, the NHS struggles to recruit individuals from elsewhere with the skills required. The British Geriatric Society has the opinion that these candidates would need extra supervision and training before they can start a higher position. [8] Time to theatre is also an issue.

[1] However, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) hip fracture guidelines [9] does not have an age-specific inclusion criterion. In contrast, the British Geriatric Society's \"Blue Book\" [10] and British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma (BOAST) guidelines [11] focus on frailty, including all fragility fractures, regardless of age. BOAST guidelines now quantify frailty in the form of a \"Clinical Frailty Scale\" as an independent inclusion criterion for those sustaining major trauma. This suggests that frailty is increasingly being recognised in trauma as an independent indicator of complex medical need, regardless of age.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 272, "end": 275, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 362, "end": 365, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 474, "end": 478, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 555, "end": 559, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Current Resources"}, {"text": "The British Geriatric Society describes frailty as a distinctive health state related to the ageing process in which multiple body systems gradually lose their in-built reserves.\" [12] Although distinct entities, there may be overlap between the management of frailty, chronic conditions and disability, and it is important to note that frailty may be the cause of disability and vice-versa.

It is predicted that approximately 10% of people aged over 65 have frailty and that in future, this number will continue to rise [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 184, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introducing Frailty"}, {"text": "Two known models of frailty exist: the phenotype and cumulative deficit model (Table 2) . Alongside his description of the cumulative deficit model, Rockwood also suggested the \"Clinical Frailty Scale\", a measurement of frailty based on his model (Figure 1 ). [14] Whilst multiple clinical frailty scales exist, some are more user-friendly and therefore more optimal for regular use in clinical practice. The CHSA Frailty Index was based upon a 70-item scale which would be difficult to use when assessing acute admission to hospital. The CFS is simpler but has been shown to have equal predictive validity. [15] The Reported Edmonton Frailty Scale also has a simple approach to assessing frailty but has limited use for patients that are not English-speaking or have visual or hearing disorders. [16] The Rockwood scale is usable, not only within an orthogeriatric setting because of the image aids next to each description of a particular frailty score, which allows for a more rapid assessment of frailty and improved compliance. It has been shown to be acceptable and practical amongst a group of junior doctors who did not receive training, with a 95% completion rate. [17] A key attribute to its success among this group was felt to be lack of increase to a busy workload. This scale is now being widely used to predict prognosis and allocate appropriate resources in various fields of medicine, most recently and significantly during the COVID-19 outbreak. [18] Frailty is increasingly ubiquitous in the National Health Service. Both the NHS Long-Term Plan and Five Year Forward View have identified the importance of comprehensive geriatric assessments for frail patients and their role within A&E and acute medical care units. [19] It recommends that all major A&E departments set up an acute frailty service to ensure those with frailty receive appropriate care quickly: \"All hospitals with a major A&E department will provide an acute frailty service for at least 70 hours a week. They will work towards achieving clinical frailty assessment within 30 minutes of arrival.\" [20] In line with this, frailty is now increasingly considered important in trauma. The 2017 Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) report recognised that comorbidity has a negative impact on outcomes for geriatric patients and suggests that other age-related factors could have further involvement. It highlighted the relevance of frailty for major trauma patients and suggested that frailty should be measured as well as recommending that the relationship between age, comorbidity and frailty needs to be explored. [21] Further research has shown that increased frailty decreases quality of life after a hip fracture and early identification of frailty will have a direct impact on prognosis, care planning and treatment. [22] Others have reported that using CFS allows predictions to be made with regards to outcomes such as \"increased mortality, length of stay, and postoperative complications\" as well as increasing patient-centred care through identifying the most vulnerable patients. [23] With the current BPT guidelines [1] remained focussed on age rather than frailty, is there a cohort of younger but frail patients losing out on optimisation, whilst an older, fit cohort currently receive unnecessary resources.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 264, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 608, "end": 612, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 797, "end": 801, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1178, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1468, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1736, "end": 1740, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2084, "end": 2088, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2607, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2810, "end": 2814, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3078, "end": 3082, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3115, "end": 3118, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 78, "end": 87, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 247, "end": 256, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Introducing Frailty"}, {"text": "It is difficult to assess whether the reduction of mortality rates for elderly hip fracture patients is due to the impact of the age-specific BPT [1] , or to the concurrent introduction of further frailty-specific guidelines and development of the orthogeriatric speciality. [24] Oakley et al. sought to determine whether the introduction of the BPT has improved outcomes with an observational cohort study. They appropriately comment that although there appears to be improved survival at 1 year for patients who fulfilled BPT criteria, the overall mortality and length of stay in both cohorts was unchanged. This may well represent that the frailest patients have a delay to theatre due to a complicating medical issue which also increased their risk of mortality. There has not been a profound \"improvement in outcomes at organisational level\" due to the introduction of the BPT. [25] The BPT's age criteria and lack of acknowledgement of frailty could be a factor in why there has not been a significant impact on overall outcomes before and after its introduction.
