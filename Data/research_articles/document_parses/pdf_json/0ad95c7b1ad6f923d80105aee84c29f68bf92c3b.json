Advances in live measurements have allowed recordings of unprecedented resolution revealing a new world of complex heterogeneous oscillations with multiple noisy non-stationary features. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating these oscillations has been lagging behind, partially due to the lack of simple tools to reliably quantify these complex non-stationary features. With this challenge in mind, we have developed pyBOAT, a Python-based fully automatic stand-alone software that integrates multiple steps of non-stationary oscillatory time series analysis into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. pyBOAT implements continuous wavelet analysis which is specically designed to reveal time-dependent features. In this work we illustrate the advantages of our tool by analyzing complex non-stationary time-series proles. Our approach integrates data-visualization, optimized sinc-lter detrending, amplitude envelope removal and a subsequent continuous-wavelet based timefrequency analysis. Finally, using analytical considerations and numerical simulations we discuss unexpected pitfalls in commonly used smoothing and detrending operations.",

To gain biological insight from these rhythms, it is often necessary to implement time-series analysis methods to detect and accurately measure key features of the oscillatory signal. Computational methods that enable analysis of periods, amplitudes and phases of rhythmic time series data have been essential to unravel function and design principles of biological clocks (Lauschke et al.

            "text": "Many time series analysis methods readily available for the practitioner rely on the assumption of stationary oscillatory features, i.e. that oscillation properties such as the period remain stable over time. A plethora of methods based on the assumption of stationarity have been proposed which can be divided into those working in the frequency domain such as Fast Fourier transforms (FFT) or Lomb-Scargle periodograms (Lomb [1976] , Ruf [1999] ) and those working in the time domain such as autocorrelations (Westermark et al. [2009] ), peak picking (Abraham et al. [2018] ) or harmonic regressions (Edwards et al. [2010] , Halberg et al. [1967] , Naitoh et al. [1985] , Straume et al. [1991] ). In low noise systems with robust and stable oscillations, these stationary methods suce to reliably characterize oscillatory signals. Recordings of biological oscillations frequently exhibit noisy and time-dependent features such as drifting period, uctuating amplitude and trend. Animal vocalization (Fitch et al. [2002] ), temporal changes in the activatory pathways of somitogenesis (Tsiairis and Aulehla [2016] ) or reversible and irreversible labilities of properties in the circadian system due to aging or environmental factors (Pittendrigh and Daan [1974] , Scheer et al. [2007] ) are typical examples where systematic, often non-linear changes in oscillation periods occur. In such cases, the assumption of stationarity is unclear and often not valid, thus the need to use nonstationary-based methods that capture time-dependent oscillatory features. Recently, the biological data analysis community has developed tools that implement powerful methods tailored to specic steps of time-series analysis such as rhythmicity detection (Hughes et al. [2010] , Thaben and Westermark [2014] ), de-noising and detrending, and the characterization of nonstationary oscillatory components (Leise [2013] , Price et al. [2008] ).",

Its working principle is the decomposition of a signal f (t) into Sines and Cosines, known as basis functions. These harmonic components have no localization in time but are sharply localized in frequency: each harmonic component carries exactly one frequency eective everywhere in time. Thus, the straighforward Fourier analysis underperforms in cases of time-dependent oscillatory features, such as when the period of the oscillation changes in time ( Figure 1C ). The goal behind wavelets is to reach an optimal compromise between time and frequency localization (Gabor [1946] ).

A wavelet power of C = 3 corresponds to the 95% condence interval in case of white noise ( Figure 2B ), which is frequency independent. For the practitioner, this should be considered the absolute minimum power, required to report 'oscillations' in a signal. It should be noted that especially for biological time series, due to correlations present also in non-oscillatory signals, white noise often is a poor choice for a null model (see also supplementary information A.3).

Also without resorting to mathematical formulas, smoothing and its eect on the time-frequency analysis can be easily grasped visually. A broad class of ltering methods falls into the category of convolutional ltering, meaning that there is some operation in a sliding window done to the data, e.g. for moving average and LOESS or Savitzky-Golay ltering (Savitzky and Golay [1964] ). Moving average lter is a widely used smoothing technique, dened simply by a box-shaped window that slides in the time domain. In Figure 2 we summarize the spurious eects that this lter can have on noisy biological signals. White noise, commonly used as descriptor for uctuations in biological systems, is a random signal with no dominant period. The lack of dominant period can be seen from a raw white noise signal ( Figure 2A ) and more clearly from the almost at landscape on the power spectrum ( Figure  2B ). Applying to raw white noise signal a moving average lter of size 5-times the signal's sampling interval (M = 5\u2206t) leads to a smoothed noise signal (Figure 2C ) that now has multiple dominant periods, as seen by the emergence of high power islands in Figure 2D . Comparing the original spectrum ( Figure 2B ) with the white noise smoothed spectrum ( Figure 2D ), it becomes evident that smoothing introduces a strong increase in Wavelet power for longer periods. In other words, smoothing perturbs the original signal by creating multiple highpower islands of long periods, also referred as spurious oscillations. To better capture the statistics behind these smoothing-induced spurious oscillations, it is best to look at the time averaged Wavelet spectrum. Figure 2E shows the mean expected power after smoothing white noise with a moving average lter. A zone of attenuated small periods become visible, the sloppy stopband for periods around 7\u2206t. These are the fast, high-frequency components which get removed from the signal. However, for larger periods 10 the Wavelet power gets amplied up to 5-fold. It is this gain, given by \u03c3 2 f /\u03c3 2 f S , which leads to spurious results in the analysis.",

For Wavelet analysis the answer is plain and clear: smoothing is simply not needed at all. A close inspection of the unaltered white noise Wavelet spectrum shown in Figure 2B , shows the same structures for higher periods as in the spectrum of the smoothed signal ( Figure 2D ). The big dierence is, that even though these random apparent oscillations get picked up by the Wavelets, their low power directly indicates their low signicance. As Wavelet analysis (see previous section) is based on convolutions, it already has power preserving smoothing built in. As illustration, we show in Figure 2F a raw noisy signal with lengthening period (noisy chirp) and the corresponding power spectrum ( Figure 2F lower panel). Without any smoothing the main periodic signal can be clearly identied in the power spectrum. Thus, Wavelet analysis does not require smoothing for the detection of oscillations in very noisy signals. For all other spectrum analysis methods which rely on explicit smoothing, characteristics of the background noise and the signal to noise ratio are crucial to avoid detecting spurious oscillations. These are usually both quantities not readily available a priori or in practice.",

Strong trends can dominate a signal by eectively carrying most of the variance and power. There are at least two broad classes of detrending techniques: parametric tting and convolution based. Both aim to estimate the trend as a function over time to be subtracted from the original signal. A parametric t always is the best choice, if the deterministic processes leading to the trend are known and well understood. An example is the so called photobleaching encountered in time-lapse uorescent imaging experiments, here an exponential trend can often be well tted to the data based on rst principle deliberations (Song et al. [1995] ). However, there are often other slow processes, like cell viability or cells drifting in and out of focus, which usually can't be readily described parametrically. For all these cases convolutional detrending with a window function w(t) is a good option and can be written as:",

In strong contrast to smoothing, there is no overall gain in power in the range of the periods, passing through the lter (called passband). There is however, in case of moving average and other time-domain lters (see also Figure S2 ), no simple passband region. Instead, there are rippling artifacts in the frequency domain, meaning some periods getting amplied to up to 150% and others attenuated by up to 25%. To showcase why this can be problematic, we constructed a synthetic chirp signal sweeping through a range of periods T 1 \u2212 T 2 , however, this time modied by a linear and an oscillatory trend ( Figure 3A ). The oscillatory component of the trend was chosen for clarity with a specic time scale given by its period T trend , which is three times the longest period found in the chirp signal. Strongly depending on the specic window size chosen for the moving average lter, there are various eects on both, the time and frequency domain (shaded area in Figure 3B ) such as the introduction of amplitude envelopes and/or incomplete trend removal ( Figure 3C ). A larger window size is better to reduce the eect of the ripples inside the passband. However, the lter decay (roll-o ) towards larger periods becomes very slow. That in turn means that trends can not be fully eliminated. Smaller window sizes perform better in detrending, but their passband can be dominated by ripples (see also supplementary Figure S3 ). In practice, sticking to lters originally designed for the time-domain without having oscillatory signals in mind, can easily lead to biased results of a time-frequency analysis. However, given the moderate gains of the detrending lter response, there is a much smaller chance to mistakenly detect spurious oscillations compared to the case of smoothing.",

The sinc function mathematically requires the signal to be of innite length. Therefore, every practical implementation implements windowed sinc lters (Smith et al.

And hence also the 'real world' version allows for a bias free time-frequency analysis. As shown in Figure 3E , the original signal can be exactly recovered via detrending. To showcase the performance of the sinc lter, we numerically compared its performance against two other common methods, the Hodrick-Prescott and moving average lter ( Figure 3F ). The stop-and passband separation of the sinc lter clearly is the best, although the Hodrick-Prescott lter with a parameterization as given by Ravn and Uhlig [2002] also gives acceptable results (see also supplementary Figure S5 ). The moving average is generally inadvisable, due to its amplication right at the start of the passband.",

However, if a lot of energy of the noise is concentrated in the slow low frequency bands, also detrending with small cut-o periods alone can yield substantial gains (see Figure S6 and Figure S7 ). Importantly, when using the Sinc lter, the background spectrum of the noise will always be uniformly scaled by a constant factor in the pass-band. There is no mixing of attenuation and amplication as for time-domain lters like moving average ( Figure 3B and C). If the spectrum of the noise can be estimated, or an empirical background spectrum is available, the theory presented in A.3 allows to directly calculate the correct condence intervals. extraction of the instantaneous period, amplitude and phase of that component is of prime interest for the practitioner.

Consequently, regions with low signal amplitudes but robust oscillations are nevertheless represented as very low power blurring them with the spectral oor ( Figure 4C ). This leads to the impractical situation, where even a noise free signal with an amplitude decay will show very low power at the end ( Figure 4E ,F and S8), defeating its statistical purpose. A practical solution in this case is to estimate an amplitude envelope and subsequently normalize the signal with this envelope ( Figure 4A and B). We specically show here non-periodic envelopes, estimated by a sliding window (see also methods). After normalization, lower amplitudes are no longer penalized and an eective power-thresholding of the ridge is possible (Figure 4D and F) .",

Here we introduced pyBOAT, a novel software package that uses a statistically rigorous method to handle non-stationary rhythmic data. pyBOAT integrates pre-and post-processing steps without making a priori assumptions about the sources of noise and periodicity of the underlying oscillations.

Here we rst analyzed the eects of data-smoothing on a rhythmic noisy signal and showed how common smoothing approaches disturb the original recordings by introducing non-linear attenuations and gains to the signal (Figures 2, S6 and S7 ). These gains easily lead to spurious oscillations that were not present in the original raw data. These artifacts have been characterized since long for the commonly used moving-average smoothing method, known as the Slutzky-Yule eect (Slutzky [1937] ). Using an analytical framework, we describe the smoothing process as a lter operation in frequency domain. This allows us to quantify and directly compare the eects of diverse smoothing methods by means of response curves. Importantly, we show here how any choice of smoothing unavoidably transforms the original signal in a non-trivial manner. One potential reason for its prevalence is that practitioners often implement a smoothing algorithm without quantitatively comparing the spectral components before versus after smoothing. pyBOAT avoids this problem by implementing a wavelet-based approach that per se evades the need to smooth the signal.",

Our analytical and numerical approaches allowed us to compare the spectral eects of dierent detrending methods in terms of their response curves (see Figure  3 ). Our results show that detrending also introduces non-trivial boosts and attenuations to the oscillatory components of the signal, strongly depending on the background noise ( Figures S6 and S7 ). In general there is no universal approach and optimally a detrending model is based on information about the sources generating the trend. In cases without prior information to formulate a parametric detrending in the time domain, we suggest that the safest method is the convolution based sinc lter , as it is an \"ideal\" (step-function) lter in the frequency domain ( Figures 3C and S3 ). Furthermore we compared the performance of the sinc lter with two other commonly applied methods to remove non-linear trends in data ( Figure 3F ), i.e. the moving average (D\u00edez-Noguera [2013] ) and Hodrick-Prescott (Myung et al.

An integrated batch processing option allows the analysis of large data sets within a few \"clicks\". For the programming interested user, pyBOAT can also be easily scripted without using the GUI, making it simple to integrate it into individual analysis pipelines. pyBOAT also distinguishes itself from other wavelet-based packages (e.g. Harang et al.

[2016] ) or RAIN (Thaben and Westermark [2014] ) are more appropriate. Its analysis reveals basic oscillatory properties such as the time-dependent (instantaneous) rhythmicity, period, amplitude and phase but is not aimed at more specic statistical tests such as, e.g., tests for dierential rhythmicity as implemented in DODR (Thaben and Westermark, 2016) . The continous-wavelet analysis underlying pyBOAT requires equidistant time series sampling with no gaps. Methods such as Lomb-Scargle periodograms or harmonic regressions are more robust or even specically designed with respect to unevenly-sampled data (Lomb [1976] , Ruf [1999] ). Being beyond the scope of this manuscript, it will be interesting in future work to integrate the ability to analyze unevenly sampled data into the pyBOAT software, either by the imputation of missing values (e.g. by linear interpolation) or the usage of wavelet functions specically designed for this purpose (Thiebaut and Roques [2005] ).",

Note the highly signicant islands of high power (P W f \u2248 15) for periods greater than around 10 sampling intervals, the largest one is in the T \u2248 20\u2206t band, marked by ( ). The ( * ) marks the end of the eective stop-band region of the lter. E) Attenuations and gain eects of smoothing with a moving average lter, (quartiles in blue). Low periods (high frequencies) are suppressed while higher periods are amplied up to 5-fold in average power. The dashed black line denotes the theoretically calculated Fourier spectrum of the moving average lter, scaled with 1/\u03c3 2 f S \u2248 5, coinciding with the numerical results (blue shaded area). The gray dotted line depicts the mean power of a white noise signal. F) Top:Noisy slowing oscillation (chirp) time-series with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1. Bottom: Corresponding wavelet power spectrum, obtained from the raw unsmoothed signal as processed by pyBOAT. In panel E, the averaged wavelet power distribution was calculated using 50 time series with 25.000 sample points each and smoothed with a window size M = 5\u2206t. Detrending: moving average vs. optimal sinc (A) Synthetic signal sweeping through the periods T 1 = 30\u2206t to T 2 = 70\u2206t within 600 sampling intervals (\u2206t). This signal has an oscillatory and a linear trend: sin(2\u03c0/T trend t) \u2212 0.0066t + 1.5, with T trend = 210\u2206t. (B) Detrending (or high-pass) response of the moving average lter with three dierent window sizes. The period range of the signal and the timescale of the trend are marked by shaded grey and violet regions respectively. (C) Time-domain eects of the moving average lters shown in B. A decreasing amplitude trend for M = 45\u2206t (top), a best compromise case M = 71\u2206t, and an incomplete trend removal for M = 141\u2206t (bottom) can be observed. (D) Detrending response of the optimal sinc lter for two dierent cut-o periods as indicated. (E) Time-domain result for the sinc lters shown in C, indicating no amplitude eects while the trend is removed. (F) Parameter-dependent performance test of three common detrending lters, namely the sinc (left), Hodrick-Prescott (middle) and moving average (right), respectively. The sinc lter provides the clearest separation between passand stop-band.

The extracted maximum power ridge (red line) reaches the lower threshold of 5 in the middle part of the signal (indicated by the light red line transition). As a reference, the (expected) analytic ridge is depicted by a black line. The cone of inuence is indicated by gray dashed lines. (D) Wavelet power spectrum of the normalized signal in panel B. The oscillations are well captured, indicated by the high power during at all times. Hence, the thresholded maximum ridge traces the whole signal.

Signals with amplitude decay have only very low powers towards the end. The amplitude normalized signals do not have a constant signal-to-noise ratio even after normalization, and therefore still have higher power on average in the beginning as compared to the signal without envelope.
