Surgical consensus guidelines are recommending caution in the use of laparoscopy for the theoretical possibility of viral transmission from aerosolization of tissue and peritoneal fluid during surgery.

While we strongly believe that it is essential to provide healthcare workers with adequate PPE in the face of any uncertainty and it is understandable that the surgical community is taken a cautious approach, it is unfortunate that patients are deprived of timely \"goal standard\" treatment in favour of conservative management or conventional open surgery. That said, unnecessary depletion of already limited worldwide stores of PPE is also not without its consequence, and anxiety surrounding occupational-related disease could be allayed with further evidence to confirm our preliminary findings.",
