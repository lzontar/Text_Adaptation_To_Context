The worldwide vaccination programs significantly reduced the number of deaths caused by infectious agents. A successful example was the eradication of smallpox in 1979 after two centuries of vaccination campaigns. Since the first variolation administrations until today, the knowledge on immunology has increased substantially. This knowledge combined with the introduction of cell culture and DNA recombinant technologies revolutionized vaccine design. This review will focus on vaccines against human viral pathogens, recent developments on vaccine design and cell substrates used for their manufacture. While the production of attenuated and inactivated vaccines requires the use of the respective permissible cell substrates, the production of recombinant antigens, viruslike particles, vectored vaccines and chimeric vaccines requires the use - and often the development -of specific cell lines. Indeed, the development of novel modern viral vaccine designs combined with, the stringent safety requirements for manufacture, and the better understanding on animal cell metabolism and physiology are increasing the awareness on the importance of cell line development and engineering areas.

Initially, live viruses were used through inoculation, i.e., subcutaneous administration of liquid taken from a pustule of a person showing mild symptoms into a healthy person to confer immune protection against the viral pathogen [3] . The term variolation refers solely to the inoculation with smallpox virus (from the Latin name of the virus \"variola\"). However, inoculation had its attendant risks: the recipients could develop the disease and spread it to others. Additionally the transmission of other diseases via bloodborne route, such as syphilis, was also a concern [2] . At the end of the 18 th century, cowpox live viruses (the variant affecting cows) were inoculated in humans to protect against smallpox, the human variant. This procedure was called vaccination, the word is derived from the Latin vacca, meaning cow. dasil \u00ae and Cervarix \u00ae are examples of marketed VLPs vaccines developed against human papillomavirus (HPV) [10, 11] . Currently, the toolbox for vaccine development is quite vast. The deeper comprehension of our immune system together with the remarkable technological innovations led to the design of a myriad of different viral vaccines (e.g. DNA vaccines, chimeric or hybrid viral particles, vectored vaccines, replication-defective viruses, antigens obtained through DNA shuffling of different viral strains) (Fig. 1) . Despite the technological progress and the promising prospects of disease control by vaccination, several challenges still stand. For many diseases there are no vaccines available and novel viruses are sure to emerge. If available, vaccines may not be 100% effective in preventing the disease, or their supply may still be insufficient, or their costs may be too high for worldwide distribution, particularly in developing countries [8] . For instance, traditional manufacturing methods for influenza vaccines are not able to rapidly respond to a pandemia. The use of eggs to propagate the virus is one of the bottlenecks, posing manufacturing problems that occasionally result in distribution delays and, in the case of a pandemia, the required number of quality fertile eggs and the capacity to process them, are unlikely to match worldwide needs [12] . Additionally, there is a growing demand for improved vaccine safety, fueled by the manufacturing requirements recommended by the regulatory entities (e.g. FDA or EMA) and by antivaccination groups [8] . Indeed some technologies are outdated and pose safety issues in already licensed vaccines [1] . For example, paralysis side effects were observed after oral vaccination against poliovirus [13] and disseminated infection after Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination [14] . Hence, some of the older vaccines, or their manufacturing processes, need to be re-examined and re-addressed. Indeed, vaccines have been continuously evolving with the technology in order to provide: safer means of immune protection to the patients and reduce possible side effects. The newer molecular technologies can play a role in this demand improving the safety profile of a vaccine both through its design and manufacturing process. For example, recombinant vaccines can be designed to minimize or eliminate virulence reversion, a potential threat of traditional attenuated vaccines. In what concerns manufacturing, the production and purification processes should also be carefully established. At this level, one particular concern is the use and choice of the cell substrate used for viral vaccines production. A thorough characterization of cell substrates is essential to establish quality control systems that allow, for example, confirming that the final product is not contaminated with adventitious agents, oncogenic proteins or DNA from the host cell. Additionally, increasing efforts are being placed in the optimization of animal cell substrates to improve the production capacity and reducing the costs, aiming at worldwide distribution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 131, "end": 134, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 135, "end": 137, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 371, "end": 374, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 716, "end": 719, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1087, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1929, "end": 1932, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2349, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2552, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2648, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2743, "end": 2747, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2823, "end": 2827, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1485, "end": 1493, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Box 1 Inoculation, variolation and vaccination procedures"}, {"text": "The triumphs of traditional viral vaccines are undeniable and inspiring.

Historically, live viruses were initially used through inoculation. Although inoculation procedures are still used in veterinary vaccination, for human use this is no longer the case. The only type of live viruses used for human vaccination are live attenuated (licensed) or vectored vaccines (under clinical development). There are several approaches to attenuate viruses. One of the most used procedures involves growing the viruses in foreign hosts, as animal cell cultures, where they replicate poorly. Several vaccines have been developed using this procedure including poliovirus, measles or rubella vaccines [8] . Today, live attenuated vaccines can be obtained through additional molecular strategies such as: reassortment (e.g. influenza and rotavirus) [16] , mutation or deletion of viral genes (e.g. dengue virus) [17] , or codon deoptimization (e.g. poliovirus) [18] . One concern related with live attenuated vaccines is the possibility of reversion into a virulent form, as seen for the first polio oral vaccine. In this context, inactivated vaccines provide safer alternatives to attenuated vaccines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 711, "end": 714, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 858, "end": 862, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 921, "end": 925, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 970, "end": 974, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Live attenuated vaccines"}, {"text": "Inactivated vaccines are generated by killing or destroying the pathogen.

Several inactivated viral vaccines are commercially available against, for example, influenza, rabies or poliovirus (Table 1 ). In addition to presenting a safer profile comparatively to attenuated viral vaccines, inactivated vaccines are also more stable. Although inactivated vaccines are quite effective for some pathogens, for others, they do not induce an effective and/or longlasting immunity since they do not give rise to cytotoxic T cells immune response, which is important to efficiently fight intracellular pathogens as viruses. Because of that, multiple doses and adjuvants are often used [19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 798, "end": 802, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 312, "end": 320, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Inactivated vaccines"}, {"text": "Subunit vaccines contain only parts of the pathogen.

Subunit viral vaccines are a further development of inactivated viral vaccines but instead of generating antibodies against all of the pathogen antigens, only one or just a few antigens are used. The real challenge in the development of subunit vaccines is to identify which antigens induce protective immunity [20] . Examples of subunit viral vaccines available are the hepatitis B vaccine (e.g. GSK's Engerix \u00ae or Merck's RecombivaxHB \u00ae ) or the recently approved influenza vaccine Flublok \u00ae (Protein Sciences). The subunit vaccines for hepatitis B are produced by recombinant technology using either yeast or CHO cells [9, 21] . The Flublok \u00ae vaccine is a recombinant trivalent hemagglutinin (rHA) vaccine produced in insect cell culture using the baculovirus expression system [22] .

The availability of sophisticated technologies also leveraged the creation of modern vaccinology approaches, as described in section 3, aiming at the development of vaccines eliciting better humoral and cellular immune responses, safer and with lower costs. These approaches often require the development and engineering of new cell lines.

Likewise, the production of complex enveloped VLPs will profit from the establishment of stable cell lines where a continuous production is enabled, facilitating bioreaction and purification processes (avoiding the need to produce plasmid DNA or baculovirus stocks and their subsequent removal from the final product).

Spontaneous immortalization is a rare event in human cells but it can be promoted by oncogenes. It was soon observed that some viruses had the ability to induce immortality. Viral genes or genomes are thus used to immortalize cells being the most classical example the HEK 293 cells, established in the early 1970s by transfor-mation of cultures of normal human embryonic kidney cells with sheared adenovirus 5 DNA [96] . Currently several immortalizing viral genes or sequences have been identified, e.g. adenovirus E1 genes, simian virus 40 large T antigen, HPV E6 and E7 genes, Epstein-Barr virus LMP, EBNA 1 and 2 genes, and human T-cell leukemia virus sequence Tax. Cellular oncogenes, and mutant p53 gene can also immortalize cells [97] . . Spontaneous immortalization is usually based on chromosomal rearrangements - not externally induced - resulting in the loss of senescence-related and/or activation of immortalizing genes; cell line development without external genetic manipulation is called simple cell line establishment. Induced immortalization can rely on chemical or physical agents (e.g. methylcholanthrene or UV) or on the integration of immortalizing genes (telomerase, SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1 genes, etc.). Depending on the immortalizing gene, the cell lines can also support the propagation of partially deleted viral vectors (such as HEK293 or PER.C6, immortalized with human adenovirus E1 gene being denominated as transcomplementing cell lines for E1-deleted adenovirus). Cell line development also encloses genetic manipulation specifically conceived to support the production of a particular virus or viral components, resulting in stable (or inducible) cells lines that constitutively (or upon induction) express the viral components [33] .

E1-only transcomplementing \"designer cell lines\" appeared then to respond to the need of safer cell lines than HEK 293 ( Table 2 ). The overall strategy was based on reducing the Ad5 E1 sequences for cell immortalization and led to the development of the PER.C6 \u00ae cell line.

In the middle of the 20 th century animal cell culture became a standard procedure to grow virus allowing the development of attenuated (AV) and inactivated (IV) vaccines. In the late 20 th century the DNA recombinant technologies allowed to develop subunit vaccines based on presenting protein antigens (P and VLPs), coding for the antigens (DNA and vectored vaccines) or both.
