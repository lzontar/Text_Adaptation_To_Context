Based on the diverse experiences of 20 ITD institutional leaders and specific case studies, this article distills key lessons learned from multiple pathways to building successful programs. The lessons reflect both the successes and failures our group has experienced, to suggest how to cultivate appropriate and effective leadership, and generate the resources necessary for leading ITD programs. We present two contrasting pathways toward ITD organizations: one is to establish a new organization and the other is to merge existing organizations. We illustrate how both benefit from a real-world focus, with multiple examples of trajectories of ITD organizations. Our diverse international experiences demonstrate ways to cultivate appropriate leadership qualities and skills, especially the ability to create and foster vision beyond the status quo; collaborative leadership and partnerships; shared culture; communications to multiple audiences; appropriate monitoring and evaluation; and perseverance. We identified five kinds of resources for success: (1) intellectual resources; (2) institutional policies; (3) financial resources; (4) physical infrastructure; and (5) governing boards. We provide illustrations based on our extensive experience in supporting success and learning from failure, and provide a framework that articulates the major facets of leadership in inter-and trans-disciplinary organizations: learning, supporting, sharing, and training.",

We assert that such lessons can benefit from diverse experience with both successes and failures of past and on-going ITD efforts. Despite progress in developing ITD research programs, young researchers are still confronted with traditional incentives that discourage ITD activities (Bark et al. 2016; Brister 2016) . To succeed, new leaders should be trained to navigate the problem-oriented nature of ITD research and to transform academic and research institutions to encourage rather than discourage ITD approaches, which is especially crucial for the solution-orientated realms of sustainability (Liu et al. 2015; McDaniels and Skogsberg 2017; Gordon et al. 2019) .",

This is not a comprehensive 'handbook' on successful ITD leadership.

The leap from interdisciplinary to transdisciplinary programs can be accelerated by focusing on the public good or the needs of external partners (Fig. 1 ). Missionoriented science requires the integration of multiple forms of knowledge and the expertise of end users. To mitigate poor air quality, for instance, requires the integrated expertise of many scientists and stakeholders to comprehend the dynamics of air quality, effects on humans and environment, and to build viable solutions, including atmospheric scientists, transportation modelers, public health officials, environmental economists, automotive engineers, and communication specialists. In the United States, federal transportation funds are tied to air quality, which incentivizes functioning ITD teams to address this as a public health and economic issue (https ://www.fhwa.dot.gov/envir onmen t/air_quali ty/). This example shows the value of a problem-oriented and solutionoriented ITD approach with stakeholders connected to specific public good outcomes (Miller et al. 2014) .",

Drawing more limited boundaries in space and time can encourage teams to tackle the inherently complex social-ecological-technical systems of sustainability challenges (Palmer et al. 2016 ) and short-term, smaller scale challenges can be equally energizing for researchers. Mitigating urban 'food deserts' is an example of a local need around which ITD researchers can band together for quick results, as food production in urban systems benefits from an ITD approach toward sustainability and social equity (Brinkley et al. 2017) . For some researchers, the tangible, local, and immediate problems may be more motivating for ITD than global grand challenges. These fine-scaled ITD problems also allow flexibility, encouraging teams to form and reorganize according to the expertise needed rather than to maintain a persistent and potentially costly organization.",

The final step of scientific integration is defined by its linkage with societal and political needs. Transdisciplinarity requires that various kinds of participants or stakeholders, here signified by communities, decision makers, and formal authorities (shown here on the horizontal axis), must be involved in posing questions, aligning methods, and assessing outcomes. The move from disciplinary science through transdisciplinary scientific-social research and intervention has been defined by the US National Science Foundation as convergence science. Some scholars use the term convergence to refer to deep integration in the scientific sphere as well (e.g., Irwin et al. 2018) Rapid response to crises is another motivation for creating ITD projects and teams. Hurricane Sandy laid bare the inadequacies of New York City's preparation for extreme weather events (Rosenzweig and Solecki 2014) . Academic institutions and local and state governments responded with an integrated resilience plan that joined expertise from research institutions, local and state agencies, community organizations, and the private sector with the explicit mission of making the metro area more resilient to major storms. The New York City Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency was created in response to the devastating hurricane, which claimed 147 lives and caused $71 billion in damages (https ://www.fema.gov/mat-resul ts-hurri canesandy ). This office works closely with academics to develop and implement science-informed resiliency efforts to better prepare the city for future impacts of climate change. The ITD approach is reflected in the many dimensions of plans that go beyond physical infrastructure to include financial instruments, social vulnerability metrics, emergency planning with community organizations, and public health readiness. Advised by the New York City Panel on Climate Change, this office includes a scientific board that works in close partnership with the Center for Climate Systems Research within Columbia University's Earth Institute.",

ITD leaders often must be more persuasive than other leaders to convince researchers to follow the unsettled and novel pathways of ITD research. Qualities that have been most transformative in our own journeys as leaders are the ability to create and foster: vision beyond status quo, collaborative leadership and partnerships, shared culture, communications to multiple audiences, appropriate monitoring and evaluation programs, and perseverance. It is important to note that these leadership qualities, skills, and attributes evolved over time.

In some circumstances, ITD leaders must act as facilitators, 'decentering' the role of academia to effectively prioritize the voices, concerns, and ideas of diverse stakeholders (Alonso-Yanez et al. 2019). Shared leadership may mirror necessities within ITD centers. Because of the multiplicity of leadership attributes, a team of more than one leader may be appropriate.

There is a tendency to want to partner with everyone who is interested, particularly in sustainability where the challenges are complex and sense of urgency is strong. However, in our experience, the most effective leaders have developed clear processes for assessing whether to partner and how to measure success of partnerships. There are transaction costs to engaging partners as every partnership is a decision to allocate time and money. If not done carefully, partnerships can drain resources, taking intellectual and financial capital from other more fruitful activities. Before engaging with partners, it is important to ask key questions: Are the partner's objectives and proposed activity aligned with our strategy and operational plans? Can we establish and commit to a clear governance structure and resourcing? Is there enthusiasm from faculty and researchers? Is the proposed engagement intellectually interesting and impactful in the field? When the answers are yes, strong leaders invest to build participation, trust, excitement, and outcomes.

Clear articulation of the possible trade-offs between the scientific ideas and participatory methods is important to establish. A transparent set of scientific tools, visualized well across research phases, and a clear integration of different ways of expressing knowledge, including the followup of the results and the feedback to the stakeholders or to the practitioners, are of central importance (Mielke et al. 2017) . Effective stakeholder engagement requires open access to data and knowledge so that key information is not restricted to the academic team members (Kondo et al. 2019) . This approach provides informed options for decision processes while also using feedback from stakeholders to advance a specific research agenda. The development of the research or solution should be co-planned with stakeholders as this facilitates a way to effectively design and to measure outcomes. Determining outcomes with stakeholders increases the chance that results will be taken seriously and be implemented, while also incentivizing communities to help with gathering data (Heinzmann et al. 2019 ). However, lack of a concrete framework or model for carrying out a transdisciplinary sustainability project can increase potential for failure or reduce effectiveness of implementation (Smetschka and Gaube 2020) .

Back-up support also needs to be available if students fail to complete a project. Ambitious goals can be valuable in motivating innovative ITD work, but appropriate expectations need to be set from the beginning and revisited frequently with internal and external stakeholders.

Buying out faculty time or borrowing individuals for part of a year for leadership or collaborative activities can relieve constrained funding.

            "text": "However, it is important to be aware that proponents of disciplines may be openly hostile to ITD programs because they see them as direct competitors for funding. Attempts to compensate by 'buying' contributions from researchers in discipline-based departments are not always successful. Short-term income generation and time pressure are often achieved at the expense of longer term relationship building. Some organizations have found endowments to be key in allowing them to function, but maintaining a funding stream through endowments can bring its own challenges, depending on investment returns and broader economic conditions. Fourth, the physical place and space of an ITD organization is vitally important. Co-location of scholars from different disciplines sparks serendipity-encouraging the hallway conversations and spontaneous brainstorming over coffee breaks-that inspires ITD work and reduces the need for formal meetings, seminars, and workshops (Lyall 2019) . Where co-location is not possible, technology to engage distant partners electronically is an important aspect of the physical place. Co-location with external stakeholders can generate easy access to policymakers and facilitate the coproduction of knowledge and solutions to real sustainability problems. One example is the Sustainable Cities Network, housed in the ASU Wrigley Institute, which brings together sustainability officers and other practitioners from municipalities and tribal governments from across the State of Arizona (https ://susta inabi lity.asu.edu/susta inabl e-citie s/). The network identifies real-world sustainability problems as opportunities for research, education, and outreach. An example of an established ongoing program that resulted from this network is Project Cities, which links courses from across Arizona State University to solve specific community solutions, with monetary and other support from the participating cities (https ://susta inabi lity.asu.edu/proje ct-citie s/). Finally, trustees, governing boards, or members of advisory bodies are important ITD resources. Supportive boards can advocate across their networks and help leaders motivate employees. However, if the Board is anchored in the past, represents legacy organizations, or is loyal to narrow disciplines, a leader must be steadfast in developing ITD strategy. Board members are often eminent leaders with large networks. However, their diversity and power require a subtle hand. They can be aloof, moderately engaged, or deeply involved depending on their defined responsibilities, individual interest, and how well the leader engages them. For example, leaders of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology & the Environment (https ://www.atree .org/) have been deeply involved with board members as advisors, sounding boards, and fundraisers. Consequently, the organization has built a healthy endowment supporting core staff and functions. This endowment, partly gifted by the board, has allowed the institution to attract reputed faculty, take risks, and be innovative.",

Continuous support from the university's president, the founding director of the school, external donors, and many committed faculty across campus gave the school the necessary time to create innovative programs not beholden to old disciplinary ways. When the degree programs opened, students flooded in, validating the school's value. The first group of graduates were nearly fully employed with many in sustainability-related careers. As sustainability programs expanded at other universities, the skepticism about the value of a sustainability college at ASU faded away. Without the perseverance of leadership, the school as a bold, transdisciplinary endeavor would not have had the chance to demonstrate its value.",

Like Columbia's Earth Institute and ASU, the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota has found communications essential to building a durable and effective interdisciplinary community. Those communications should celebrate the accomplishments of participants as a way to draw attention to the innovative ways they do their work and to increase their recognition and acclaim. Without this celebration, interdisciplinary achievements have a difficult time standing alongside more traditional approaches and standards. Further, to sustain the incentives for interdisciplinary and translational scholarship, institutes must have recurring and reliable funds, or else incentives for risk-taking and experimentation are lacking and the institute will fail to push the university in new, transformative directions.",

The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) found that shared terminology can sometimes be deceptive, tacitly connoting disparate ideas to those from different disciplines. Terms must be unpacked to reveal the disciplinary biases, different theoretical structures, and even the divergent practical motivations. BES participants found that it simply takes time to achieve this unpacking. Ultimately, the ITD project has produced shared meanings rather than a shared language. Perseverance through respectful, mutually open dialog among those who may come from different disciplines is the deep requirement. hosted a follow-up workshop on \"Tackling Complex Sustainability Issues: Lessons from Inter-and Transdisciplinary Organizations\" which led to the production of this paper.",
