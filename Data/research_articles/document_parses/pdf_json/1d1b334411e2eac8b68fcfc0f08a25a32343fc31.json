Proof. The first claim follows from Lemma 5 and Theorem 3. For the converse, let \u227a be a transitive c.e. relation on N. Define S = { n, m, k \u2208 N 3 |n \u227a k and m \u227a k}, and let (X, \u03d5, S) be the complete computable topological space for S as constructed in the proof of Lemma 5. The proof will be completed by showing that X = I(\u227a) as subsets of P(N). First we show I(\u227a) \u2286 X. Fix I \u2208 I(\u227a). It is clear that I satisfies condition (i) of the definition of X. Next, condition (ii) is satisfied because if n, m, k \u2208 S and k \u2208 I, then n, m \u227a k by the definition of S, hence {n, m} \u2286 I because I is a lower set. Finally, condition (iii) is satisfied because if {n, m} \u2286 I the directedness of I implies there is k \u2208 I with n, m \u227a k, hence n, m, k \u2208 S. Therefore, I \u2208 X.",
