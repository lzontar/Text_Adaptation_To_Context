As of April 11, 2020, totally 1.61 million COVID-19 patients were confirmed in more than 200 countries and regions with 99690 deaths. 1 While each country has taken all measures to control the spreading, wearing mask in general population is still controversial and different countries have different recommendations on mask use in community settings. 2 Some scholars strongly suggest wearing masks in general population, 3 however, WHO does not recommend wear masks in general population because of lack of evidence. 4 However, the absence of evidence of effectiveness just means no relevant investigation, but is not equal to evidence of ineffectiveness.3 So far, accumulating evidence has indicated that wearing mask in general population is useful to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.",

Masks cannot completely prevent the pathogen exposure, but can reduce the amount of exposed pathogen to below the infectious dose, a certain amount that can cause an infection. Even if failed in preventing an infection, wearing mask can still reduce the amount of exposed pathogen, which will cause a relatively mild disease. Thus, wearing masks in general population can prevent at least a considerable proportion of COVID-19. More recently, Ma et al showed that N95 mask, medical mask, and homemade mask with 4-layer kitchen paper and 1-layer cloth blocked 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of avian influenza virus in aerosols respectively, 5 which provide evidence that masks can block the transmission of viruses in publics.",
