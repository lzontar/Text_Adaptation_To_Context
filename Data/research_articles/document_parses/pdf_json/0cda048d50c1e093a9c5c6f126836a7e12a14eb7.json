(2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process-multi-site neutral)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially 'chaotic', unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M 0 ) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M 0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M 0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. For example, M 0 =5.758 (COVID-19, China, or 196=M 0 x34 in total) vs. M 0 =2.701 (COVID-19, World) vs. M 0 =9.475 (SARS, World) suggested", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "that the potentially 'stabilized' infection level of COVID-19 in China is nearly \u00bd lower than that of SARS worldwide, but twice higher than that of COVID-19 worldwide. This may indicate that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters \u03b8 and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative 2 significance of \"infection through local contagion\" vs. \"infection through migration\", both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions. Third, comparing the levels of TPL-M 0 and \u03b8 may leverage the complementary nature of TPL analysis and metapopulation modeling. For example, their difference (\u03b8-M 0 =0.6) for the COVID-19 in China confirmed the critical importance of controlling migration (mobility) in suppressing the outbreak, although migration may have been a primary driving force for the initial outbreaks in several regions of China.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The spatial and/or temporal distributions of many biological populations including microbes and humans follows Taylor's power law (TPL) (Taylor 1961 , Taylor et al. 1977 , 1983 , 1988 , and recent studies have also revealed its applicability at the community scale (Ma 2012a , Li & Ma 2019 , Taylor 2019 , Ma & Taylor 2020 . TPL has been verified by hundreds if not thousands of field observations in nature (Taylor 2019), and it has also found cross-disciplinary applications beyond its original domains of biology and ecology in disciplines such as computer science, natural disaster modeling, and experimental physics (Eisler et al. 2008 , Ma 2012b , Tippett & Cohen 2016 , Helmrich et al. 2020 . Despite that TPL was proposed more than a half century ago (Taylor 1961) and there is not yet a consensus on the underlying mechanisms generating TPL (Eisler 2008 , Stumpf & Porter 2012 , there seems to be a recent resurgence of interests in this near universal model that captures the relationship between the population mean (m) and variance (V) in the form of a simple power function (i.e., V=am b ) (e.g., Cohen & Schuster 2012 , Cohen & Xu 2015 , Giometto et al. 2015 , Kalinin et al. 2018 , Oh et al. 2016 , Reuman et al. 2017 ).

As suggested by the literature of TPL, when the TPL parameter (b) exceeds 2, the population dynamics can be rather chaotic, indicating potentially chaotic behavior of coronavirus outbreaks.

First, test the fitting of the TPL model to the datasets under evaluations (such as SARS or COVID-19 infections). The testing determines the applicability of TPL based on well-established statistics such as p-value or R (linear correlation coefficient).

Although the both are similar conceptually, it should be emphasized that they have different ecological interpretations. In particular, when m=M 0 , it means that the population spatial distribution or temporal stability (variability) is random; when m<M 0 , the distribution or stability is regular or uniform. Whether or not the population may die off is uncertain. If m happens to coincide with the threshold of Allee effects, population (infections) may indeed die off.interpreted as the rate at which new individuals are added to the metacommunity due to speciation. The UNTB assumes that the SAD (species abundance distribution) of each community sample can be described by the multinomial (MN) distribution, which is parameterized by the previously mentioned two parameters. Testing the UNTB model is then computationally equivalent to testing the goodness-of-fitting to the MN distribution. However, a fully general case of fitting multiple sites UNTB with different immigration rates is computationally extremely challenging (actually intractable) even for small number of sites. In other words, to test the UNTB in truly multi-site (multiple local communities), approximate algorithms must be used(Harris et al. 2015). It wasHarris et al. (2015) that developed an efficient Bayesian fitting framework for testing the UNTB by approximating the neutral models with the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). For this reason, we refer to the computational framework developed byHarris et al.

A lower M 0 may signal a lower threshold for the occurrence of outbreak, which may imply higher outbreak risk from a public health perspective. Previously, we have shown that COVID-19 appears to have a higher outbreak risk compared with SARS. Given that both of the coronaviruses appear to have virtually equal bvalues, then one wonders if they have any essential differences, revealed in this study, from the epidemiological or public-health perspectives. M 0 (infection critical threshold) seems to be such an effective indicator (property) for assessing outbreak threshold (risk). Our study suggested that COVID-19 possesses a lower infection critical threshold (M 0 ) than SARS does may be explained by its lower fatality rate compared with SARS. Obviously lower lethality to hosts should actually be favorable for the survival and spread of virus.Ma ZS & Taylor RAJ. (2020)  Human reproductive system microbiomes exhibited significantly different heterogeneity scaling with gut microbiome, but the intra-system scaling is invariant.
