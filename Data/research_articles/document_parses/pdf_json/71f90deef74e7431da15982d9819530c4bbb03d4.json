Current data indicates that viral RNA levels in maternal blood are low and there is no evidence of placental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Published reports to date suggest that perinatal transmission of SARSCoV-2 can occur but is rare. Among 179 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2 at birth from mothers with COVID-19, transmission was suspected in 8 cases, 5 with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 3 with SARS-CoV-2 IgM. However, these cases arise from maternal infection close to childbirth and there are no information about exposition during first or second trimester of pregnancy. Welldesigned prospective cohort studies with rigorous judgement criteria are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors for perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",

This new test allowed to establish in vitro the relationship between infectious virus and number of copies that is now estimated to be 1.8 TCID50 (approximately J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 infectious particles for 11 copies (95% confidence interval: 7.2-52.6 copies). A very recent submitted article shown that in a cohort of 50 COVID patient, but 78% male, the detection of viremia, using the WHO RT-qPCR protocol, rise significantly from 60% to 88% according to the severity of the disease.

Another study failed to demonstrate viral production following direct infection of blood monocytes with high infectious doses of SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI 10, i.e. 10 infectious particles / cells) (Wang X et al. 2020) . Conversely, the authors described a gradual decrease in the intracellular amount of RNA over time. These results should however be put into perspective if we consider the experience of Chikungunya for which there is no infection of PBMC in vitro but for which we have been able to repeatedly show the transient presence in monocytes and lymphocytes B in the blood of patients and during ex vivo infection of whole blood in humans, as well as in the macaque model. (Her et al. 2010 ) These data suggest that the frequency and titers of RNAemia in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may be lower or at most equivalent to that seen in SARS-CoV-1 infected patients. In addition, the virus does not seem capable of developing a productive infection in the circulating monocytes, or at a very low level, in line with previous observations on SARS-CoV-1 (Castilletti et al. 2005) . These results remain to be confirmed once the detection tests in plasma have been optimized.",

Alzamora et al. 2020; Yan et al. 2020) . All of the patients were infected in late pregnancy and delivered within a few days of infection (mean: 3 days, range: 0 to 25 days). PCRs were performed on amniotic fluid and on cord blood during respectively 37 and 48 of these deliveries, all of which were negative. (Table 1) Among the 179 newborns, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal samples from six of them, one at 16 hours of life, two at 36 hours of life and three at 48 hours of life. Thus, the timing of transmission cannot be determined in these cases. Transmission may have occurred after birth via the inhalation of droplets produced by contaminated parents or professionals, or via breastfeeding. The authors state that the infants were delivered by cesarean section and immediately separated from their mothers and placed in isolation, suggesting that postnatal transmission by the mother was unlikely. (Table 2 and (Malek et al. 1996) . However, whether this is evidence of in utero transmission has been disputed (Kimberlin and Stagno 2020) . The sensitivity / specificity of IgM detection would be 88.2% / 96.2% and 70.2% / 99% according to these same studies and thus much higher than that observed for other viral infections. Furthermore, none of this children had a positive RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples (H. Dong et al. 2020 ) nor in the blood (H. ). In addition, the decrease in IgM is very rapid in the Dong L study, going from 45.83 AU / mL to 2 hours of life compared to 11.75 AU / mL on the 14th day of life (for a positivity threshold of 10 AU / mL), which seems surprising in the case of a congenital infection J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Although the majority of children born to infected mothers did not seem to have any symptoms, three of them nevertheless presented with severe pneumonia linked to SARS-CoV-2(L. . In these three children the possibility of perinatal or postnatal transmission is unlikely since they were born by cesarean section and were separated from their mother from birth. In the perinatal period, maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection can have harmful consequences on obstetric outcomes and on newborns, resulting in particular in respiratory distress, biological abnormalities, premature deliveries and even fetal death in utero (Y. . The authors hypothesize that hypoxemia in the mother may be responsible for fetal hypoxia at birth and premature delivery. Finally, rare cases of very severe infection have been described in very young children (Cui et al. 2020 ), suggesting that infants may not be very susceptible to COVID-19.",

            "text": ", transmission of some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, HPV and HIV, may occur via the ascending route, from virus or infected cells in the cervicovaginal compartment. This type of transmission concerns sexually transmitted infections in particular. Only one study evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the vaginal fluid from 10 women, and all samples tested negative for the virus. (Qiu et al. 2020) Fetal and neonatal infection: direct (PCR) and indirect (serology) detection Very little data is available yet on neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2, with conflicting results. The studies published to date have very small numbers. While some teams do not find an infected newborn by testing for the virus in samples of placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and neonatal throat swabs. Other publications suggest a possible vertical transmission due to the presence of IgM in certain newborns born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2.There are 179 cases of newborns tested for SARS-CoV-2 at birth from pregnant women infected in the third trimester of pregnancy described in the literatureXiaotong Wang et al. 2020;Yu, Li, Kang, Xiong, et al. 2020; S. Wang et al. 2020; H. Zhu et al. 2020; L.   Zeng et al. 2020;Breslin et al. 2020; H. Zeng et al. 2020;Dong et al. 2020;Yang et al. 2020;",

Chen et al. 2020) Thus, transplacental transmission cannot be completely excluded in these cases, and intrapartum transmission could have occurred as well, during the passage in the genital tract via maternal secretions (H. Chen et al. 2020). Zeng et al. and Dong et al., described three cases of newborns with positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG serologies at birth from mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 (H. Zeng et al. 2020; Dong et al. 2020). While maternal IgG antibodies cross the placenta, IgM are of fetal origin, thus suggesting in utero exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus",
