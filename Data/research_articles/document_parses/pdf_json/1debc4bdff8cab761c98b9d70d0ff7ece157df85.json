In this proof-of-principle study, we assessed direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopore sequencing technology for fast whole-genome sequencing of viruses directly from clinical samples. Results of the approach were complemented with those obtained by sequencing the corresponding viral cDNA via Illumina MiSeq sequencing. DRS of total RNA extracted from three different enteroviruspositive stool samples produced long RNA fragments, covering between 59% to 99.6 % of the best reference genomes.

EVs are associated with a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from mild respiratory diseases to severe neurological infections, leading potentially to death [2] . These single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family possess a relatively small genome size ranging from 7.2 to 8.5 kb. For routine diagnostics, EV presence is generally determined by real-time, reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays, complemented by partial sequencing of the VP1-VP4 coding regions for genotyping [2, 3] . Due to the lack of proofreading mechanism in RNA replication, EV genomes are highly variable and the likely subject of within-and between-genome recombinations [4, 5] . Therefore, when diagnostic tests solely rely on PCR using conserved primer sequences, false-negative results cannot be excluded. There is thus a need to generalize the assessment of EV diversity and evolution via a whole-genome approach, rather than from the limited information gained from sequencing short sequences alone.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 199, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 357, "end": 360, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 704, "end": 707, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 708, "end": 710, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 877, "end": 879, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The main limitation towards a general adoption of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for better EV characterization and better understanding of their evolution and epidemiology, is mostly of technological nature: WGS approaches are more expensive, technically demanding and hence time consuming than standard molecular assays; as such they are generally not routinely used in diagnostic laboratories. In the case of RNA viruses, the challenge is even more exacerbated because various molecular steps (RNA purification, extraction, cDNA synthesis, and optionally amplification) add to the turnaround time and final cost of the assays. Clinical WGS applications are mostly based on Sanger sequencing and on second-generation sequencing platforms, with Illumina MiSeq/HiSeq and Ion Torrent machines leading the market, as benchtop sequencing technologies enable highthroughput sequencing at an affordable price per sample when samples are multiplexed [6] . Third-generation sequencers, i.e. SMRT technology (Pacific Biosciences) and nanopore sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT), have recently emerged as complement to or replacement of second-generation sequencers, by enabling the sequencing of single, long DNA molecules, a feature that is particularly attractive in the context of sequencing full-length viral genomes [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 943, "end": 946, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1327, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Nanopore sequencing technology has been successfully applied to genome sequencing of RNA viruses.

Additionally, nanopore sequencing has been used successfully to sequence whole EV genomes from viral cDNA extracted from cell cultures: In their proof-of-concept study [12] , the authors demonstrated that nanopore sequencing could be applied for rapid routine whole genome sequencing of EV with sufficient accuracy compared to Sanger sequencing.

This method, direct RNA sequencing (DRS), yields full-length, strand-specific RNA sequences and enables the direct detection of nucleotide modifications in native RNA molecules.

With a range of only 16-315 total reads mapping to enteroviruses for the three samples, the approach was yet close to the limit of detection. In the case of sample E590, this sensitivity issue may explain why co-infection with another enterovirus was not detected, as compared to the short-read sequencing-based approach. Low sensitivity of nanopore sequencing in a viral metagenomic approach has been reported previously in patient samples with low viral titers, even when sequencing viral genomes via SISPA-based amplification [13] . An improvement in sensitivity would be necessary before attempting to sequence samples with low viral load in general. A limiting factor of the approach was the amount of polyadenylated RNA used for library preparation, as in two of the sequencing runs the full flowcell sequencing capacity was not used and the sequencing was stopped before maximal run duration, because low amounts of RNA library were loaded on the flowcell. If sufficient amounts of patient samples were available, increasing the input concentration might have provided better coverage of the target sequences. Furthermore, DRS sequencing is expensive if only one sample is loaded per flowcell. Recent progress with barcoding for DRS [33] might however reduce this problem in the future. Additionally, results might be improved with adaptations in viral enrichment steps. We used a chloroform/bead pre-treatment in DRS samples for enrichment of viral capsid and although it might be efficient in enriching viral reads, it could also reduce the overall amount of RNA extracted. As the maximum sequencing yield of the flowcell was not always reached, perhaps milder enrichment methods might be preferable, especially if the broader diversity of pathogens is to be studied.

However, unambiguous identification relies on the capsid region and its presence is crucial in case of recombinations or co-infections. Therefore, great care must be applied during extraction and library preparation to avoid shearing or degrading extracted RNA. The known high variability of EV genome sequences makes it necessary to have suitable alternatives for genotype identification available if PCR-based approaches fail. In such cases, DRS of patient samples could be a valuable alternative, as the sequencing is primer-independent and the sequences of long, native RNA molecules are recovered. Additionally, as is the case with all nanopore sequencing, the data is available in real-time, which can provide faster identification and a sequencing-on-demand approach to molecular assays.Overall, our proof-of-concept study demonstrated to the possibilities offered by the DRS technique for genotype identification of human enteroviruses directly from clinical samples. The method requires further optimization to improve the overall sensitivity and to lower costs for future possible applications in routine diagnostics. However, with the rapid advancement of the technologies those issues will likely improve in the near future.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "14/15"}]}
