Evolutionary and psychological research has shown that touch is an important part of bond-building and emotion communication; loneliness is intimately related to these elements as well. In this paper, we ask whether physical contact reduces feelings of loneliness -which might derive from evolutionary ancient bonding mechanismsdespite a cultural context that is relatively non-tactile. Method An experimental study (40 participants, 13 males) tested for observable effects of touch on loneliness scores in a low-contact culture to analyse whether they respond positively to that stimulus despite cultural training against it. Results Participants exposed to physical contact reported significantly lower neglect scores from their close relationships in a short loneliness scale, thus suggesting that there is an underlying mechanism that persists despite enculturation. The effects were particularly strong among single people, which could mean that lower loneliness among married people might be partly explained by the regular availability of physical contact. Participants in the experimental condition also showed a faster reduction in heart rate, interpreted as a sign of physiological wellbeing. Conclusions These findings help to specify mechanisms within the evolutionary theoretical framework of loneliness that link internal feelings to environmental cues.

Evolutionary features respond to specific processes but the quality of a relationship -or the perception of the quality-is a general abstraction of a collection of events and perceptions rather than a straight-forward unitary trait. In other words, to provide adaptive fitness, loneliness needs to be connected in some way to the (social) environment and not just to a subjective evaluation (satisfaction) or perception of the social network and/or social interaction.

Previous research has studied the relationship between loneliness and several internal factors, ranging from personality traits (Beadle et al. 2012; Cheng and Furnham 2002) , genetics (Boomsma et al. 2005; Goossens 2012; McGuire and Clifford 2000) , and physiological and biochemical processes (Cacioppo et al. 2000; Eisenberger and Lieberman 2004; Hawkley and Cacioppo 2010; Nausheen et al. 2007) . Nonetheless, there are still rather few data on the environmental cues to which those internal factors respond, other than objective social isolation, which does not fully account for loneliness variance (de Jong Gierveld and van Tilburg 2016; Holt-Lunstad et al. 2015) . Under an evolutionary perspective, the link between loneliness and environment is crucial, and for that reason this investigation opens up a potentially fertile line of research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1081, "end": 1101, "text": "(Beadle et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1125, "text": "Cheng and Furnham 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1158, "text": "(Boomsma et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1173, "text": "Goossens 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1200, "text": "McGuire and Clifford 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1269, "text": "(Cacioppo et al. 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1301, "text": "Eisenberger and Lieberman 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1328, "text": "Hawkley and Cacioppo 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1350, "text": "Nausheen et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1596, "text": "(de Jong Gierveld and van Tilburg 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1622, "text": "Holt-Lunstad et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although the small sample means that these results should be treated with caution, they nonetheless suggest that it is worth exploring the effect of touch on preventing or reducing loneliness and that touch could potentially explain married people's comparatively lower loneliness scores. This is a promising research avenue in terms of strategies to diminish loneliness and its negative impact on psychological and physiological wellbeing. It is also relevant to conduct further research on this issue in the context of a global coronavirus pandemic which is enforcing \"social\" distancing (i.e. physical distance), which is likely to decrease psychological well-being in many ways, loneliness being one of them.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Notwithstanding the theoretical implications and reported findings, this research has limitations. One of them is that the physical contact participants experienced was brief and of a pragmatic nature with no explicit social content. Touch with apparent pragmatic purposes and no social content was specifically selected for this study to avoid making participants feel uncomfortable when touched by a complete stranger and to avoid disclosing up front the reason for the physical contact, which could bias participant's responses. However, it is also possible that this cautionary strategy diminished the potential effects under study. Thus, further research based on more complex experimental designs where participants receive more physical contact -perhaps in a more explicitly social condition-is required. It could be interesting to analyse the effects of different forms, intensity, and duration of social touch (e.g. socially acceptable contact on specific areas of the body, as indicated by the touch maps of Suvilehto et al. 2015 Suvilehto et al. , 2019 . It is also crucial to associate touch behaviour with social meaning (i.e., displays of affection, comforting, soothing) in future experimental designs and/or take this difference into account to have a better understanding of the real-life effects of physical contact on feelings of loneliness.

We selected a low-contact, individualistic society for methodological reasons, i.e., conducting the experiment in a cultural setting which endorses and promotes behaviours opposed to the experimental condition. Although this allowed us to separate cultural effects from experimental effects, further studies are needed before arriving at general conclusions about cross-cultural effects of physical contact on loneliness. Accounting for cultural effects -and estimating its magnitude-would require collecting data in different cultural groups. However, we were able to show that physical contact seems to reduce loneliness scores even among people who are culturally expected to be emotionally self-reliant and used to low physical contact in their daily lives. That is, the expected effects were observed in the most unlikely scenario, which indicates that it is worth exploring the issue further with a crosscultural perspective.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Future studies could also explore other aspects of this topic that might yield interesting insights. From a methodological perspective, it would be relevant to analyse whether lack of physical contact precludes loneliness or physical contact buffers loneliness, or both.

Also, more research on touch and loneliness could help expand our understanding of the evolutionary history of loneliness as an adaptive mechanism and could help us detail specific triggers for the loneliness alarm and its operational mechanisms, which currently are not clearly outlined.

Culture has often been treated as a control variable, but the evidence reviewed here highlights the importance of looking deeper into the way in which cultural practices interact with emotion in general, and loneliness in particular. Human behaviour is always a psychological phenomenon, but it is also a cultural phenomenon too. Involving both dimensions in scientific research simultaneously is not only possible but necessary if the aim is to understand human social behaviour in all its complexity. Thus, this paper brings forward the need for placing the analysis of loneliness and other subjective well-being phenomena in a richer cultural context. We know that, to a certain extent, culturallydetermined lifestyles hinder or promote mental health, and mental health is becoming a growing concern in different public policy agendas. It is important to redefine the scientific approach to the interaction between culture and phenomena like loneliness and consider the implications for public and social policy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This paper has examined the relationship between touch and loneliness within specific cultural settings, particularly individualistic and low-contact.
