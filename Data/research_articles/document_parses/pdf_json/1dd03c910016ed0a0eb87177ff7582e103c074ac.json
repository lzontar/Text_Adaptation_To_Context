The 24year-old female donor had suffered a severe traumatic brain injury following a road traffic accident. Brain stem testing was undertaken by the neurosurgical team, and she was found to be brain stem dead. Unfortunately, brain stem testing was not legally recognized in 1967. The donor was taken to theatre where life-supporting therapy was withdrawn by stopping the ventilator [15] . Hypoxic cardiac arrest ensued and death was declared 5 min following electrical asystole. A sternotomy was rapidly undertaken followed by intravenous heparinization. Right atrial and ascending aorta cannulae were inserted before placing the donor on cardiopulmonary bypass at a flow of 3.5 L/min. A left ventricular vent was placed before cooling the donor. At 26\u00b0C, the flow was dropped to 500mls/min, and an aortic cross clamp was placed distal to the aortic cannula to perfuse the isolated heart. Retrieval of the kidneys then began whilst the heart was continually perfused and cooled down to 16\u00b0C. The recipient, who suffered from end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, was prepared in an adjacent operating room and placed upon cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor heart was retrieved without cardioplegia and placed in ice cold Ringer's solution before being transferred next door. In the adjacent operating room, the donor heart was connected up to the recipient cardiopulmonary bypass machine and the donor heart perfused with 400mls/min of blood. Implantation was undertaken with continuous antegrade coronary perfusion, thus limiting further ischaemia. The heart was transplanted using a double suture line throughout, beginning with the left atrium, followed by the right atrium, the pulmonary artery and then the aorta. The heart required one internal defibrillation from ventricular fibrillation back into nodal rhythm of 120 bpm. Following rewarming, the recipient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass but unfortunately the aortic pressure began to fall and the recipient was placed back on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Two further attempts were made within minutes of each other, and on the third attempt, the heart was successfully weaned from CPB upon an infusion of isoprenaline. The recipient was taken to intensive care and was extubated on day one post-operatively. The recipient did extremely well for the first 10 days but thereafter she developed exhaustion, fever and dyspnoea. Under the impression that she was suffering from rejection, the immunosuppression regimen, consisting of heart irradiation, methylprednisolone and azathioprine, was intensified further with steroid boluses. Unfortunately, rather than rejection the recipient had developed Klebsiella pneumonia and she died on day 18 from overwhelming sepsis. This first human heart transplant revealed without doubt that DCD heart transplantation following hypoxic cardiac arrest was possible, if rapid reperfusion was utilized in combination with continuous perfusion during implantation, thus limiting further ischaemia. Following Barnard's success, there was a flurry of subsequent heart transplant activity worldwide. The second human heart transplant was performed 3 days later by Adrian Kantrowitz in the Maimonides Medical Centre in New York. The donor was an anencephalic male infant and the recipient suffered from Ebstein's malformation and right ventricular outflow obstruction. They did not wait for mechanical or electrical asystole in the donor. Instead after an irregular rhythm was observed in the donor, topical cooling of the child in ice cold water was instituted. The heart was then removed and placed in ice cold solution. Fifty-five minutes following donor asystole, the cross clamp was released in the recipient. Unfortunately, the heart was unable to support the circulation and the recipient died 6 h later [16] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 149, "end": 153, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3960, "end": 3964, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History of human DCD heart transplantation"}, {"text": "The first human heart transplant performed in the UK was by Sir Donald Ross in 1968 at the National Heart Hospital in Marylebone after his experimental work in animals at the Royal Veterinary College.
