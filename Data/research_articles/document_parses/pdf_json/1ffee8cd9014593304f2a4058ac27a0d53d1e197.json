While some parameters appear to be 72 improved, with longer sleep duration on weekdays and a decreased social jetlag (indicating a 73 less variable sleep timing), chronotype was significantly delayed. One could speculate that this 74 might be associated with changes in lifestyle associated with weaker social cues (e.g. mainly 75 work and school schedules, which became more flexible, delayed or even absent) and a lower 76 exposure to light in the morning (and/or a higher exposure in the evening hours) reflecting a drift 77 from regular entrainment. While people significantly decreased their sleep debt by about 40 78 minutes a day on weekdays, the sleep duration during free days did not shorten at all. It is 79 possible that sleep debt is smaller but not completely absent during lockdown; however, our 80 results suggest there is no direct compensation between sleep debt on weekdays and recovery 81 on free days. However, objective measures of sleep and circadian rhythms, as well as light 82 exposure, seem imperative to determine the consequences of all these simultaneous changes. 83 84 Sleep and chronotype exhibit developmental changes: sleep duration decreases, and social 85 jetlag and chronotype show a peak at the end of adolescence [5, 6]. Our results support these 86 main effects, showing that age interacts with lockdown: younger subjects experienced larger 87 changes in sleep and chronotype than older ones. The magnitude of the lockdown-induced 88 changes depended on subjects' working status: changes in the working schedule regulated how 89 much sleep and chronotype are affected during lockdown. Those subjects who started to work 90 6 from home or those who stopped working slept more and exhibited less social jetlag and later 91 chronotypes than those who continued working outside during lockdown. This result is 92 important because the COVID-19 outbreak offers the unique opportunity to evaluate how sleep 93is affected depending on working schedules, since it is likely that work and school schedules 94 will be affected chronically after the lockdown period is completed.",

This correlated with higher levels of 98 depression and anxiety, also found in China during the enforced lockdown period [8]. An 99 important strength of our work is that we evaluated not only sleep but also chronotype in the 100 same subjects under both control and lockdown conditions. Additionally, the whole country was 101 equally and globally enforced to adopt the mandatory confinement on the same date (March 102 20 th , 2020). Finally, the large size and the distribution of ages, geographical locations and 103 characteristics of work and cohabitation status of our sample also allow us to evaluate which 104 predictors modulate the impact of lockdown on the general population. Since sleep and 105 circadian entrainment affect the immune system [9, 10], healthy sleep and circadian rhythms 106 might contribute as a protective strategy against infective diseases. It is quite likely that these 107 quarantine measures will extend into the following months, and even years, making this 108 analysis necessary and timely for psychological and physical wellbeing recommendations.
