Thus, approaches to rapidly build evaluation products are important. In this paper, we present a case study that exploits fortuitously available human-curated knowledge that can be manually converted into a resource to support automatic evaluation of computational models. Although this process is still rather labor intensive, it would be valuable in the future to generalize our efforts into a reproducible methodology for rapidly building information access evaluation resources, so that the community can respond to the next crisis in a timely manner.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Xia Song, Alina Stoica, Saurabh Tiwary, and Tong Wang. 2016.
