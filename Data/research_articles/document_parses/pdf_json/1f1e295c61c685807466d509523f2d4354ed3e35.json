There are also benefits for healthcare professionals, given that their confidence to discuss end-of-life care improves when they are equipped with knowledge of patient and family wishes (Poppe et al., 2013) . Similarly, when an older person living with dementia is involved in their endof-life care discussions, carers experience less guilt and feel more prepared and confident implementing decisions at the end of life (Sellars et al., 2019) .",

Many older people including those with dementia are being encouraged to complete advance care plans (Curtis et al., 2020) ; however, for some, this may already be too late as they lack capacity. Families may now be faced with new decisions including should they still go and visit their relative during the COVID-19 outbreak? This will be particularly difficult for those who live in a care home or have dementia and may be confused as to why their relatives no longer visit them. Families will be faced with making difficult and emotive decisions on their behalf as proxy. Many of these decisions, for example, about place of care and hospitalization, will need to be made rapidly in an acute situation.",

However, other challenges remain such as family carers lacking information to make informed decisions which they fear cannot be altered once made or not trusting healthcare professionals' knowledge (Sellars et al., 2019) . Family carers may not have the time to process the information that is given to them to make informed choices or to discuss decisions with other family members such as siblings. Healthcare professionals may not have time or capacity to develop relationships with older people or family carers; most of whom they are unable to meet face to face prior to having these challenging and often difficult conversations. Professionals engaging in difficult conversations often rely on in-person and nonverbal cues to facilitate discussion of sensitive subjects; however, telephone conversations hinder this, and some people may not have access or the skills to use technologies such as video calling.",

However, for many where conversations have not occurred, they will be faced with uncertainty and trying to anticipate what they think the individual would want (Lamahewa et al., 2018) . In making decisions, families will be encouraged to consider the best interests of the individual. For many, these decisions will generate a wealth of emotional distress, anxiety, guilt, and burden (Caron et al., 2005 , Forbes et al., 2000 . The substituted interests model is an approach that may help reduce the stress on family in end-oflife decision-making (Sulmasy and Snyder, 2010) . Typically, decisions made by proxy decision makers are based on substituted judgments which require them to determine what the person lacking capacity would have chosen for themselves. However, studies have demonstrated that the preferences of proxies about end-of-life care do not always match with those of the older person (Harrison Dening et al., 2016) . The substituted interests model asks the proxy to describe the values of the person lacking capacity, such as cultural, religious, or personal preferences; important relationships; and who they would want to make decisions. The healthcare professional presents realistic information about the clinical circumstances and then draws on the values of the person to recommend a course of action that will be unique to that person (Sulmasy and Snyder, 2010) . Decision-making becomes a joint process between the proxy and the healthcare professional.",

Society as a whole has their part to play with this; supportive social networks and communities can help to desensitize these conversations and ensure conversations are discussed before acute events, better preparing everyone involved (Sawyer et al., 2019) .",

Having discussions and being involved in decision-making are important elements for helping families and carers prepare for end of life. Feeling unprepared for death is associated with higher levels of complicated grief after death (Hebert et al., 2006) . In dementia care, family carers often start grieving before death as they experience a range of relationship and personal losses. Studies show between 47% and 71% of these carers report grief while caring and 20% experience complicated grief after death (Chan et al., 2013) . Carers may experience higher grief if they feel that the dying process was traumatic or unexpected and they may live with regretting care decisions or being unable to say goodbye to their family member (Supiano et al., 2020) . These scenarios may be heightened in this time of uncertainty and where families may not be able to see or have physical contact with their relative at the end of life. Families who are able to see a relative who is dying in hospital may then have to socially isolate afterward and not be able to attend the funeral. It is important to note that staff may also suffer from significant grief and moral distress following the deaths of their patients. They may have to give distressing news over the telephone or receive calls from multiple grieving relatives. This may be particularly traumatic for care home staff and other residents who will often consider their residents to be part of their family.",

However, within this context, there are also new challenges and obstacles to overcome. Greater pressures on healthcare systems will mean access to scarce intensive care resources may not be available to all, particularly those who may be considered less likely to recover from a severe case of COVID-19. Discussions about end of life usually benefit from relationship building between healthcare professionals, patients, and families, but current circumstances may limit communication between all parties. Technology may offer alternative forms for communicating where social distancing is in place, but these options may be challenging or not possible for many frail older people and people with moderate to advanced dementia. Decision aids may offer a practical tool to help carers make difficult decisions as proxies for the family members.",
