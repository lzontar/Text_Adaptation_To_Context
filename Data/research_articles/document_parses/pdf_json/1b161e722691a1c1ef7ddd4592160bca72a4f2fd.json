Nevertheless, a 70 meta-analysis by Ni Y (2017) reported the protective factor of obesity in Acute 71 Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients [14].

Its rapid transmission and 159 considerably high case-fatality rate have called for the recognition of important risk 160 factors and high-risk population for better prevention and treatment approach. 161 Obesity has been speculated to act independently in increasing the risk and 162 worsening the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this systematic review, three 163 included studies are consistent, despite a moderate degree of variability, in showing 164 the deleterious effect of obesity in COVID-19 severity, inducing critical and advanced 165 hospital care. 166 The findings from the included studies acknowledged the increased risk of 167 COVID-19 severity in obesity. Nevertheless, those three studies reported a variable 168 degree of association between obesity and severe COVID-19, which might be related 169 to the differences in the definition of the reported outcome (invasive mechanical 170 ventilation, ICU admission, severe infection), comparator group, sample size, and to 171 a lesser extent, the use of different BMI cut off points for obesity. 172", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "its sample size was the smallest among them, this research included multivariate 191 analysis to omit the possibilities of other important comorbidities affecting the study 192 outcome. Different to other prognostic studies, this study did not differentiate the 193 mortality rate of obese and non-obese patients; hence, might not directly reflect a 194 poorer prognosis of disease severity in obese COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, a 195 paper by Yang X et al. showed higher mortality rate of patients requiring mechanical 196 ventilation [4]. Thus, choosing the necessity of mechanical ventilation in obese 197 COVID-19 might be an appropriate outcome to assess prognosis and hospital cost. 198 Possible mechanisms related to disease severity in obesity are speculated to 199 occur through higher ACE-2 concentration, chronic inflammation, and functional 200 restrictive capacity of obese lung. ACE-2 receptor has been recognised as a 201 coreceptor for 2019-nCoV entry and known to be expressed in many parts of human 202 body: gastrointestinal tract, lung, heart and kidney [20]. A recent publication has 203 reported the increased expression of ACE-2 receptor in adipose tissue [21]. This 204 means having more adipocytes is equal to be having more ACE-2 receptors to catch 205 2019-nCoV. Moreover, chronic inflammation in obesity is apparent with the 206 increased interleukin 6 (IL-6) level, adipokines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., 207 TNF-a, inferferon), inducing a chronic low-grade inflammatory state in obesity and 208 impairing immune response [12,13,19]. The total lung capacity has also been 209 reported to be reduced in obese patients, and improved by bariatric surgery [22,23]. 210 Moreover, a study by Campos et al. also emphasised the impact of obesity to reduce 211 lung function in sedentary subjects [23]. Hence, obese patients tend to be more 212 susceptible to COVID-19 infection and rapid severe disease progression due to its 213 lower baseline lung functional capacity than normoweight people. 214 On the other hand, a meta-analysis by Ni Y et al. (2017) reported the fluid or vasopressor requirement in circulatory failure [14]. This condition was 219 thought to contribute to a diminished potential of disease progression to ARDS. 220 However, Ni Y study made no attempt to explain the direct effect of obesity and 221 ARDS, in contrast to the previous explanation through molecular and lung functional 222 capacity changes in obesity. Hence, our study also shed light on the contrasting view 223 of ARDS and obesity. The severity of ARDS and overall COVID-19 clinical 224 manifestations increased in obese patients infected with COVID-19 and this 225 population even showed a higher need of invasive mechanical ventilation [19]. 226 Findings from COVID-19 which were discussed in this study were also in line with 227 previous coronaviruses studies: coronavirusHKU1[24] and MERS-CoV virus [25]. 228 These studies had previously stated the increased prevalence and risk of obese 229 people to coronavirus infection.230", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "study design: DLT; Data collection and analysis: AT, DLT; Article draft 255 writing: AT; Draft revision: DLT; Writing supervision: DLT.
