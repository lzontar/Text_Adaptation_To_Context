The rate at which the number of infected people increases with time is related to the size of the event which corresponds to infected individuals and susceptible individuals coming into close proximity with one another. The size of this event is clearly proportional to the product of the number of susceptible individuals (S) and the number of infected individuals (I). Conversely, the number of susceptible individuals falls at the same rate as they cease to be susceptible and become infected. Equation 2 .01 suggests that the number of susceptible individuals decreases with the growth rate of the disease. Since growth rate is never negative, it implies that the function S(t) is a decreasing function. Equation 2 .02 suggests that the rate of increase in infectious individuals increases with the growth rate (obviously) and decreases with more individuals getting infectious. Finally, equation 2.03 suggests the recovery (immunity) rate is directly proportional to the number of infectious individuals. This implies that R(t) is an increasing function.",

To be able to work with this data, it is crucial to pre-process them, which in itself is a significantly time-consuming task. The next step is to model the pandemic with simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using compartmental models like SIR and SIS. Various parameters will be involved in these equations. Prudent values have to be assigned to these parameters to solve the differential equations. Clues for deciding them can be obtained from the data we pre-processed. Once this is done, the evolution of all compartments with time have to be plotted to understand the nature of the pandemic and to hunt methods to 'flatten the curve'.",

For simulations involving small populations of people, an efficient method is to represent each individual in the population as a string or vector of characteristic data and simulate the epidemic using computational means. This type of model is referred to as MBI (Models Based on Individuals). It can be used to include a large number of characteristics for each individual(such as age, sex, pre-existing health conditions, external factors). This method, however, is computation heavy and uses quite a lot of memory and processing time if the population being modelled is very large. For MBI, parallel processing has been used to significantly reduce computation time for models such as SIR. Simulations can be run parallely on clusters of computers making use of data from previous outbreaks. This was, in fact, used by RTI and University of Pennsylvania to model the spreading of epidemics. They used MATLAB codes and the Parallel Computing Toolbox to make models. Again, this significantly reduced processing time.",

The effect of setting up medical facilities is studied in a later subsection. Now, these lock downs can be executed in various fashions. One model is that of continuous lock down, like the ones depicted above. But as proved above, they just delay the onset of the disease.

In a real sense, it is very much probable for a section of individuals to violate lock down due to personal reasons. To take this into account, instead of defining \u03b1 to a definite value at the time of lock down (0.14 in our previous simulations), we may define it as a periodic function oscillating between a definitive maximum and minimum values with the period referring to the time scale with which lock down is violated periodically.

But, \u03b5 should also account for the medical efficiency (accuracy of the tests). Now, taking into account the early stringent lock down measures that the Government of India has taken, the accuracy factor seems to be a far more dominant factor of the two. So, we redefine \u03b5(t) as the rate which which the accuracy in COVID-19 test is increased, thereby giving lesser false negatives with time.

We have relaxed this requirement in our model, wherein transitions can occur to the deceased (D) or disabled (R d ) compartments from any of the following compartments: Symptomatic infected (I s ), Asymptomatic Infected (I as ), Quarantined (Q), ICU (Q) and Carrier State (C).\u2022 In our model, we have accounted for the possibility of re-infection (after subsequent loss of immunity upon recovery) by incorporating a transition line from Recovered (R) compartment to the Susceptible (S) compartment.",
