IAV infection was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy slowed fusion of IAV with endosomes and reduced activation of interferon signalling. This was consistent with conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showing that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leukocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy pathways in airway epithelial 20 cells as a novel innate defence mechanism that can restrict IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.",

Given the high social and economic cost of these 5 viruses, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of how the airways defend against virus infection. Viruses entering cells by endocytosis are killed when delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Lysosome delivery is facilitated by noncanonical autophagy pathways that conjugate LC3 to endo-lysosome compartments to enhance lysosome fusion. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of 10 ATG16L1 to demonstrate that non-canonical autophagy protects mice from lethal IAV infection of the airways. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity murine-adapted IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high Introduction Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen of major global public health concern (Yamayoshi & Kawaoka, 2019). As with SARS CoV-2, animal reservoirs of IAV can contribute to zoonotic infection leading to pandemics with a high incidence of viral pneumonia, morbidity and mortality. IAV infects airway and alveolar epithelium and 5 damage results from a combination of the intrinsic pathogenicity of individual virus strains as well as the strength and timing of the host innate/inflammatory responses. Optimal cytokine levels protect from IAV replication and disease but excessive cytokine production and inflammation worsens the severity of lung injury (Davidson et al., 2014 , Herold et al., 2015 , Iwasaki & Pillai, 2014 , Ramos & Fernandez-Sesma, 2015 , Teijaro et al., 2014 . 10 Even though infection of the lower respiratory tract can result in inflammation, flooding of alveolar spaces, acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure the factors that control IAV replication at epithelial surfaces and limit lethal lung inflammation remain largely unknown.",

Measurement of cytokine expression at 2 d.p.i showed that IAV induced a transient increase in transcripts for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), ISG15 and IFIT1 (Iwasaki & Pillai, 2014) and pro-inflammatory cytokines ) in the lungs of both control and \u03b4WD mice ( Fig 3A) . This increase in cytokine 5 expression was resolved by 3 d.p.i. before a second wave of increased cytokine expression at 5 d.p.i. This second wave of cytokine expression was resolved by 7 d.p.i in control mice, but \u03b4WD mice showed sustained increases in ISG15, IFIT1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and CCL2 transcripts, co-incident with exacerbated weight loss. At 3 d.p.i lungs of \u03b4WD mice showed increased expression of neutrophil chemotaxis factor CXCL1 mRNA (Fig. 10 3A), coincident with increased neutrophil infiltration of airways and parenchyma, and extensive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as a consequence of neutrophil degeneration as shown by IH ( Fig. 3B and S1). Increased neutrophil infiltration of airways in \u03b4WD mice at 2 d.p.i. was confirmed and quantified using flow cytometric analysis of broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL; Fig. 3C ). At 5 -7 d.p.i. increased expression of CCL2 15 mRNA in \u03b4WD mice was coincident with extensive macrophage/monocyte infiltration into lung parenchyma observed by IH ( Fig. 3B and S2) which was not seen in controls. This increased macrophage/monocyte infiltration in \u03b4WD mice was confirmed and quantified using flow cytometric analysis of single cell suspensions from lung tissue (Fig. 3D ). It is known that, in severe IAV infection, a cytokine storm occurs that is amplified by 20 plasmacytoid dendritic cells pDCs (Davidson et al., 2014) . pDCs detect virus-infected cells and produce large amounts of cytokines, in particular IFN\u03b1\u03b2, that in severe infections can enhance disease. In these cases, depletion of pDCs can decrease morbidity (Davidson et al., 2014) . Depletion of pDCs in IAV-infected \u03b4WD mice using anti-PDCA-1 led to markedly decreased weight loss as compared with isotype control-treated mice and that was similar to that seen in littermate controls (Fig3E). This indicates that excessive cytokine production amplified by pDCs is responsible for the increased morbidity seen in the \u03b4WD mice. 5 Thus, mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy failed to control lung virus replication and inflammation, leading to increased cytokine production, morbidity and mortality.",

This 15 has been reported to increase resistance to IAV infection (Lu et al., 2016) , and this was also observed in mice used in our study (Fig. S3) where LysMcre-mediated loss of Atg16L1 prevented rapid weight loss and reduced virus titre. This led us to test the possibility that the \u03b4WD mutation to ATG16L1 could also increase IL-1\u03b2 secretion, and cause the increased inflammation observed during IAV infection. This was tested by 20 incubating BMDM with LPS and purine receptor agonist, BzATP (Fig S4A) , or by challenging mice with LPS ( Fig S4B) . Mice with a complete loss of ATG16L1 in myeloid cells (Atg16L1 fl/fl -lysMcre) showed three-fold increases in IL-1\u03b2 in both serum and of secretion IL-1\u03b2 from BMDM in vitro. In contrast IL-1\u03b2 secretion in \u03b4WD mice did not differ significantly from littermate controls ( Fig S4A&B) .

To test whether wild-type bone marrow-derived cells could protect susceptible \u03b4WD mice from lethal IAV infection, we generated radiation chimeras (Fig. S6 ). When challenged with IAV, \u03b4WD mice reconstituted with either wild-type or \u03b4WD bone marrow remained highly sensitive to IAV ( Fig. 4A & B) with body weight reduced by up to 25% and 20 decreased survival by 5 d.p.i. As seen for \u03b4WD mice, weight loss was associated with a 10-fold increase in lung viral titre (Fig. 4C) , fulminant pneumonia and inflammatory infiltration into the lung (Fig. 4D ). This increased susceptibility to IAV was not observed for control mice reconstituted with wild-type marrow, showing that non-canonical autophagy pathways in phagocytes and other leukocytes from control mice were not able to protect \u03b4WD mice against lethal IAV infection. In a reciprocal experiment ( delivery of viral ribonuclear proteins (RNPs) into the cytoplasm (Skehel & Wiley, 2000 , Wharton et al., 1994 . RNPs are then imported into the nucleus for genome replication (Boulo et al., 2007) . The effect of non-canonical autophagy on IAV entry was tested using a fluorescence de-quenching assay where the envelope of purified IAV was labelled with green (DiOC18) and red (R18) lipophilic dyes. MEFs incubated with IAV for increasing times were analyzed by FACs to detect the green fluorescence signal generated when the dyes are diluted following IAV fusion with the endosome membrane ( Fig. 6A -C). The percentage of cells emitting a green signal was greater in MEFs from \u03b4WD mice (60% 5 compared to 40% for controls at 30 min p.i.) and increased with time (73% versus 56% for controls; Fig. 6B ). Likewise, the median fluorescence intensity was 1.6 -1.4-fold higher in MEFs from \u03b4WD mice ( Fig 6C) . This showed that non-canonical autophagy slowed fusion of IAV with endosome membranes. The recognition of viral RNA by interferon sensors following delivery of RNPs into the cytoplasm was used as a second 10 assay for IAV entry. MEFs from \u03b4WD mice showed between 3 and 5-fold increases in expression of IFN responsive genes, ISG15 and IFIT1 ( Fig. 6D & E), and this was also observed in the lung in vivo (Fig. 3A) . Taken together the results demonstrate for the first time that the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 allow non-canonical autophagy to provide a novel innate defence mechanism against lethal IAV infection within the epithelial 15 barrier in vivo. showed profound sensitivity to infection by a low-pathogenicity murine-adapted IAV (A/X31) leading to extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, dysregulated cytokine production, fulminant pneumonia and lung inflammation leading to high mortality and death usually seen after infection with virulent strains (Belser et al., 2011) .

The fact that morbidity in \u03b4WD mice could be decreased by depleting pDCs indicates that excessive cytokine production, amplified by pDCs was 15 a major factor. This is not due to a lack of non-canonical autophagy/LAP in pDC as bonemarrow chimaeras of \u03b4WD mice with wild-type leukocytes have the same phenotype as \u03b4WD mice. IAV is recognized by endosomal TLR3 in respiratory epithelial cells and RIG-I detects virus replicating in the cytosol leading to activation of IRF3 and NFkB with subsequent induction of interferon, ISG and proinflammatory cytokine production (Iwasaki 20 & Pillai, 2014). Increased inflammation may result directly from increased virus in the lungs, but the increased fusion of IAV envelope with endosomes in \uf064WD mice may increase delivery of viral RNA to the cytoplasm resulting in the sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine signalling. A similar pro-inflammatory phenotype resulting from decreased trafficking of inflammatory cargoes is observed following disruption of non-canonical autophagy by LysMcre-mediated loss of Rubicon from macrophages or microglia (Heckmann et al., 2019 , Martinez et al., 2016 .",

Mice were weighed daily and the weights presented as a percentage of the starting weight. Panel B. Lung tissues were taken at 5 d.p.i. and virus titer determined by plaque assay. Data represent the mean value \u00b1 SEM. Analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference (* p < 0.05). Thus, Atg16L1 fl/fl -LysMcre mice that are deficient in canonical autophagy in phagocytes lose weight at the same rate as littermate controls but are more resistant to virus replication as they have lower lung virus titres. LysMcre-mediated deletion of autophagy genes from mice leads to increased inflammatory threshold characterised by raised secretion of IL-1\u03b2 from macrophages (15), and in the lung this can increase resistance to IAV infection (16). The possibility that the \u03b4WD mutation could affect IL-1\u03b2 secretion was tested by stimulating BMDM with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and BzATP (P2X7 receptor agonist) or challenging mice with LPS. Panel A. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from mice strains as indicated were incubated with 100 ng/ml of LPS for 4 h and 150 \u03bcM of BzATP for 30 min. Supernatants were assayed for IL-1\u03b2 by ELISA. (Mock group: untreated, BzATP controls only received BzATP). Representative data are shown as the means \u00b1 SD of readings from 20 wells per group and were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc analysis (**** p<0.0001). Approximately three-fold increases in IL-1\u03b2 secretion were seen for BMDM from Atg16L1 fl/fl -LysMCre mice. However, IL-1\u03b2 secretion from \u03b4WD BMDM did not differ significantly from littermate controls. Panel B. Mouse strains (as indicated) were injected with 20 mg/kg of LPS via the IP route. Serum collected 90 min post injection was assayed for IL-1\u03b2 by ELISA. In nontreated mice IL-1\u03b2 was below the detection limit in all 3 strains (not shown). Data are shown as the means \u00b1 SD of duplicate assays from 4 mice per group and were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc analysis (** p < 0.01).

In these mice, non-canonical autophagy was absent in cultured phagocytes (BMDM) but it was present in skin fibroblasts (Fig S7D). After infection with IAV, \u03b4WD phag mice showed comparable weight loss and virus titres to those seen in littermate control mice (Fig. 5A & B). Likewise, the raised IL-1\u03b2 levels (Fig. 5C) and profuse macrophage and neutrophil lung infiltration observed in \u03b4WD mice were absent (Fig. S8) and similar 10 to littermate controls. The ability of the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to protect epithelial cells against IAV infection was tested ex vivo to further exclude any contribution from recruited leukocytes. Virus titres in precision cut lung slices (Fig. 5D) from \u03b4WD mice were 10-fold greater than controls. Thus, the sensitivity of \u03b4WD mice to IAV was not due to the loss of non-canonical autophagy from myeloid cells, making it likely that 15 non-canonical autophagy mediated by the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 protects against lethal IAV infection in non-myeloid tissue. Non-canonical autophagy slows IAV fusion with endosomes and reduces interferon signalling.

Thus, protection against severe IAV-15 associated disease in the respiratory tract of the host relies heavily on non-canonical autophagy in non-leukocyte populations.Activation of non-canonical autophagy in phagocytic cells leads to LC3 associated phagocytosis (LAP) where TLR signalling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) recruit LC3 to phagosomes. A lack of involvement of LAP in protection against IAV disease in vivo 20 was surprising because the activation of LAP in phagocytic cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils by would provide a powerful means of recognising and controlling microbial infection in vivo. In vitro studies show that activation of acid sphingomyelinase by Listeria monocytogenes(Gluschko et al., 2018) and subsequent ROS production by NOX2 recruit LC3 to phagosomes. Similarly, activation of TLR2 and NOX2 by Legionella dumoffii in vitro signal ULK1-independent translocation of LC3 to single-membraned vacuoles containing Legionella(Hubber et al., 2017). In both cases LC3 promotes fusion with lysosomes. The observation that virulence factors such as the 5 GP63 metalloprotease of Leishmania major and melanin of Aspergillus fumigatus prevent recruitment of NOX2 to phagosomes to prevent LAP(Akoumianaki et al., 2016, Kyrmizi et al., 2018, Matte et al., 2016 further suggest that non-canonical autophagy in phagocytes should provide a defence against infection. One reason for the discrepancy may be that the studies cited above have focused on in vitro experiments using microbes 10 with a tropism for macrophages, rather than in vivo studies where pathogens encounter epithelial barriers.Intranasal infection of mice with IAV results in rapid infection of principally airway and pulmonary epithelial cells(Akram et al., 2018). The results of in vivo challenge of radiation chimaeras and \u03b4WD phag mice strongly suggest that non-canonical autophagy in 15 the epithelium rather than leucocytes is responsible for restricting IAV infection. This was supported by ex vivo experiments where virus titres and interferon responses were 5 -10 fold greater in precision-cut lung slices, and MEFs from \u03b4WD mice. Furthermore, loss of non-canonical autophagy increased fusion of IAV envelope with endosomes, and increased activation of interferon signalling pathways. Both assays suggest that non-20 canonical autophagy reduces IAV entry and delivery of viral RNA to the cytoplasm. This would explain reduced interferon signalling, and at the same time the delayed escape of IAV into the cytoplasm would increase the transfer of endocytosed virus to lysosomes for degradation. The precise mechanisms employed by non-canonical autophagy to reduce virus entry from endosomes are unknown. This may involve recruitment of LC3 to endosomes by TMEM59(Boada-Romero et al., 2016) to increase fusion with lysosomes, or by maintaining membrane repair during virus entry, as observed for bacteria such as S. Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes(Kreibich et al., 2015, Tan et al., 2018. A 5 p22 phox -NOX2 pathway that recruits LC3 to vacuoles containing S. Typhimuriumin epithelial cells(Huang et al., 2009)  may also be activated during IAV entry and hamper lethal infection.",

Rubicon stabilises the PHOX:NOX2 complex (Yang et al., 2009) allowing 10 reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce binding of ATG16L1 to endo-lysosome membranes(Martinez et al., 2015). Mouse models relying on loss of Rubicon show defects in the clearance of bacterial and fungal pathogens and apoptotic cells(Martinez et al., 2016, Martinez et al., 2015, but have not yet been studied in the context of viral infection. Furthermore, disruption of Rubicon leads to upregulation of IL-1\u03b2, IL6 and TNF-15 \u03b1 secretion, and the mice fail to gain weight and develop an autoimmune disease that resembles Systemic Lupus Erythematosus(Heckmann et al., 2017, Martinez et al., 2016.This exaggerated inflammation might make it difficult to predict if any altered responses to infection observed in Rubicon-/-mice, particularly lung inflammation, resulted directly from loss of non-canonical autophagy, or from upstream changes in cytokine regulation 20 caused by loss of Rubicon.",

It will be interesting to see if the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 limit infection by other microbes at epithelial barriers in vivo, particularly infection of the respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2. This may be true for picornaviruses where LC3 is recruited to enlarged 10 endosomes during entry of Foot and Mouth Disease virus(Berryman et al., 2012) andfollowing LC3 accumulation on megaphagosomes in pancreatic acinar cells during coxsackievirus B3 infection(Kemball et al., 2010). In the specific cases of IAV and SARS-Cov-2, non-canonical autophagy at epithelial barriers is likely important for innate control of new pathogenic strains, where acquired immunity from previous infection may be15    absent or less effective.

ROS induces binding of the WD domain of ATG16L1 to endo-lysosome membranes (iii) leading to recruitment of the LC3 conjugation machinery (ATG16l1:ATG5-ATG12, ATG7, ATG3) (iii) and conjugation of LC3 to PE (iv) 15 B) Left column: MEFs from littermate control express \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms of ATG16L1 at 70 kDa, convert LC3I to LC3II and generate LC3 puncta during autophagy induced by HBSS.

Staining for histone H3 was undertaken with an autostainer (Discovery XT, Ventana), using citrate buffer, dilution buffer and detection kits provided by the manufacturer. The antibody reaction was visualized with 3,3'diaminobenzidine and sections counterstained with haematoxylin. 5 Statistical analysis. Data were analysed using the Prism package (version 5.04Graphpad Software). P values were set at 95% confidence interval. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA (Bonferroni post-test) was used for time-courses of weight loss; twoway ANOVA (Bonferroni post-test) was used for other time-courses; log-rank (Mantel-10 Cox) test was used for survival curves; one-way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc) was used to compare three or more groups side-by-side; Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare two groups.
