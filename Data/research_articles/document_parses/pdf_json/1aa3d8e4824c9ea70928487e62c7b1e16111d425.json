Airway vascularity and pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, bFGF, angiogenins) are upregulated in the airways of asthmatics. We investigated whether early life pneumoviral infection leads to the development of pulmonary angiogenesis, and whether this is due to viral-induced up-regulation of proangiogenic factors in the lung. Methods Lung tissues were collected following primary or secondary infection of newborn BALB/c mice with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Viral titre and expression levels of pro-angiogenic factors in lungs were determined by qPCR. Angiogenesis was quantified by immunohistochemistry using the angiogenic markers CD31 (PCAM-1) and von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Results Angiogenesis was apparent 14 days post infection (dpi) (CD31 = 0.3 \u03ee 0.1, vWF = 0.2 \u03ee 0.2), peaked at 28 dpi (CD31 = 30.8 \u03ee 3.6, vWF = 38.4 \u03ee 5.3) and regressed by 35 dpi (CD31 = 0.3 \u03ee 0.3, vWF = 0). A secondary infection at day 82 re-activated angiogenesis by day 96 (vWF = 46.8 \u03ee 6.7). Detection of pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF, Ang1 and Tie2) in the lung correlated with the observed angiogenesis.

However, there is increasing evidence that under certain circumstances, Th1 cells are involved in the induction of asthmatic manifestations and can potentiate pathological responses. The mechanisms by which Th1 cells are involved in asthma remain unclear. We assessed the interaction between Th1 cells and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the induction of airway hyper-reactivity (AHR). Methods Antigen-specific DO11.10 Th1 or Th2 cells were generated in vitro, in the presence of OVA 323-359 peptide with IL-12/anti-IL-4 or IL-4/anti-IFNg respectively.

Some groups of animals that received Th1 cells were administered 50 ng LPS together with the last OVA 323-359 challenge. Other groups were treated with anti-IFNg, dexamethasone or cytotoxic antibody to deplete neutrophils.

Allergen-evoked airway inflammation was induced by longterm recurrent ovalbumin-exposure and the effects of SK1-deficiency on lung vasculature were investigated. Results Under inflammatory conditions, quantitative RT-PCR showed upregulated pulmonary levels of eotaxin mRNA in SK1-KO as compared to na\u00efve mice, whereas mRNA-expression of IL-4 as well as S1P-synthesizing and degrading enzymes was unaltered. BAL of chronically inflamed SK1deficient mice contained more cells in total and a larger number of CD68positive macrophages/monocytes as compared to BAL of wt lungs. Following allergen-exposure, a remarkable remodelling of intraacinar vessels and small pulmonary arteries with longitudinally orientated smooth muscle cells luminal to the internal elastic membrane was observed in SK1-KO mice as compared to wt mice. Using isolated ventilated mouse lungs perfused with the thromboxane receptor agonist U46619, vascular hyperresponsiveness was observed in allergen-exposed lungs from wt and SK1-KO mice, with higher vascular responsiveness of SK1-KO lungs.

The constant phase model (CPM) is fit to Zrs to calculate airway resistance (Raw) tissue damping (G) and tissue elastance (H). The default settings of flexiVent apply an unweighted (absolute) fitting of the CPM to the Zrs spectra. This may not be appropriate for mice with severe lung disease. Methods Adult female BALB/c mice with influenza-induced lung disease were challenged with methacholine (MCh). Data were analysed using the default \"primewave\" settings of flexiVent v5.1. These same data were then adjusted to remove the two lowest frequencies (0.25 and 0.625 Hz) and a relative (weighted) fitting of the CPM was applied. Results The default analysis produced a poor model fit and uninterpretable measurements of Raw, G and H, especially at higher MCh concentrations. Applying the weighted fitting improved the application of the CPM to Zrs spectra.

We have demonstrated that an ongoing, but not cleared, chlamydial lung infection at the time of allergen sensitization promotes a skew from a Th2 to a mixed Th1/Th2 allergen-specific T-cell response that promotes neutrophilic and suppresses eosinophilic inflammation. During this neutrophildominated allergic airways disease (AAD), goblet cell hyperplasia and AHR are reduced but still present. The resulting phenotype has features similar to neutrophilic asthma in humans. We examined whether pulmonary neutrophil influx during infection plays an important role in the ability of an ongoing infection to induce AAD with this phenotype.

Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) can contribute to the development of asthma in predisposed individuals.

The GSTM1 null genotype has been associated with asthma; however, this has not been previously examined in children with acute asthma. Aim To investigate if GSTM1 null influences asthma severity in acute asthmatic children who are exposed to household ETS. Methodology Children (n = 219), aged 2-16 years, were recruited on presentation with acute asthma and the severity of their attack assessed. Exposure to household ETS was determined via questionnaire data, and individuals were genotyped for the presence of GSTM1 using PCR.

Background ACAM currently recommend 24 indicators to measure population-level asthma health and outcomes. We examined correlations among several asthma indicators covering prevalence, morbidity and mortality to try and produce a condensed set of indicators which minimized redundancy. Methods Seven of the 24 indicators were included in this study: prevalence of ever having doctor diagnosed asthma, prevalence of current asthma, asthma-related general practice (GP) encounters, proportion of people with asthma with an asthma action plan (AAP), hospitalizations for asthma, hospital patient days for asthma, and deaths due to asthma. A correlation matrix was created for these indicators by age groups. Pearson correlation coefficients \u05460.7 or \u0545-0.7 were considered strong. Results There were strong positive correlations between prevalence of ever asthma and current asthma (r = 1.0); GP visits and AAP possession (r = 0.74), hospitalization (r = 0.91) and patient days (r = 0.95); and hospitalization and patient days (r = 0.90) and AAP possession (r = 0.73).

Having productive cough in childhood may identify high risk asthmatics who require especially rigorous management in early life. One third of women experience an improvement in asthma during pregnancy, and symptoms improve in most women in the late third trimester. We hypothesized that the exacerbation rate would be reduced and that symptoms during exacerbations would be less severe in the third trimester compared to the second trimester. Methods Pregnant women with asthma (n = 81) were prospectively followed from recruitment (14.8 weeks (3 SD) ) to delivery at clinic visits (18, 30, 36 weeks and during exacerbation), and fortnightly phone calls. The asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) was administered at each contact and exacerbations classified as severe (requiring medical intervention) or mild (selfmanaged). Lung function, medication use, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) and full blood counts were assessed. Paracetamol is commonly used in infants as an analgesic and antipyretic. It has been hypothesized that frequent paracetamol consumption may result in reduced lung capacity to cope with oxidative stress and increase risk of respiratory disease. To date, no study has examined exposure to paracetamol during infancy, when lungs are still developing, and risk of childhood asthma. Method A birth cohort of 620 infants with an atopic family history was recruited. Frequency of paracetamol exposure was prospectively documented up to 2 years of age. Interviews were conducted at 6 and 7 years to ascertain asthma in the previous 12 months. Results Paracetamol exposure in infancy was common (97% exposed by two years of age), with some infants receiving paracetamol on up to 77 days. It has been hypothesized that mucosal immune response requires a particular micro-flora milieu in the infant's gastro-intestinal tract, and that early life antibiotic exposure may disrupt this process and increase risk of allergic disease.

Reproductive factors were examined as risk factors for asthma using multiple logistic regression to adjust for all likely confounders. Results A total of 2,776 women completed the most recent postal survey. Of these 355 (12.8%) had current asthma, and of these women with current asthma 73.5% (261) developed asthma after childhood. On average these women were in their mid-twenties when they developed asthma (mean \u03ee SD age = 26.6 \u03ee 12.5 yrs).

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a risk factor for uncontrolled asthma. We conducted an update of a systematic review to assess whether treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux in subjects with asthma improved asthma outcomes. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GORD treatment in adults or children that reported asthma health outcomes and had symptomatic GORD were included and assessed in accordance with the standard Cochrane systematic review process. Subjects received pharmacological therapies compared with conservative management. Results From 261 potentially relevant studies, 19 RCTs were included in the review. When compared to placebo, morning peak expiratory flow did not significantly improve (change from baseline WMD 10.43, 95% CI: -9.55 to 30.42) with proton pump inhibitor treatment (n = 7 trials involving 739 participants). Asthma exacerbations were not significantly less in the intervention groups compared with the control groups (odds ratio 0.66; 0.41-1.08; n = 557). Conclusions While some trials reported evidence of asthma improvement with GORD therapy, overall there appears to be no statistically significant evidence of a beneficial effect. It is clear that not all persons with GORD and asthma will gain improved control over their asthma with GORD therapy; this may be due to the heterogeneous pathophysiology of asthma. Future large-scale trials would be required to demonstrate an effect on asthma exacerbations. KEL and BRD were supported by a Cochrane Airways Group Scholarship.

Port Hedland is impacted by iron-containing dust particles (PM10) that may activate lung cells when inhaled. Furthermore, the effects of Port Hedland PM10 may differ from the effects of urban PM10 impacting metropolitan areas. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Port Hedland PM10 on production and release of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, by human airway epithelial (A549) cells, and to compare these with the effects urban PM10 from metropolitan areas. Methods Human airway epithelial (A549) cells were exposed to PM10 collected at Port Hedland and at urban locations (Sydney, Perth). A549 cells were exposed to a range of PM10 concentrations (20-200 mg/ml) for 24 h. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were used as positive controls. Supernatants from cell cultures were assayed for IL-6 and IL-8 using specific ELISA kits. RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA. IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression was quantified by duplex real-time PCR using TaqMan primer/probes.

In asthma, corticosteroids can halt some, but not all, aspects of airway remodelling. Therefore, in order to aid future design of efficacious anti-remodelling agents we need a better understanding of the molecular mechanism/s underlying the development of airway remodelling and the effectiveness of corticosteroids. Hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle (ASM) is a feature of the remodelled airway in asthmatics. In this study we examined the effect of corticosteroids on a key regulator of G1 progressioncyclin D1. ASM cells from n = 8 non-asthmatics and n = 7 asthmatics were pretreated for 1 h with vehicle or dexamethasone (0.1 mM). The temporal kinetics of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein expression were measured up to 24 h after stimulation with the mitogen platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). PDGF-BB induced a significant increase in cyclin D1 mRNA expression in ASM from non-asthmatics (2.6 \u03ee 0.3-fold) and asthmatics (2.9 \u03ee 0.3-fold) after 24 h stimulation. In non-asthmatics, the corticosteroid dexamethasone significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the amount of cyclin D1 mRNA expressed (to 1.6 \u03ee 0.2-fold). In contrast, cyclin D1 expression in asthmatics was relatively resistant to inhibition by dexamethasone; the amount of PDGF-BB-induced cyclin D1 expression in the absence or presence of dexamethasone was not significantly different ( Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid found elevated in the airways of asthmatics, modulates myriad airway smooth muscle (ASM) functions that promote inflammation and remodelling in asthma. In this study, we uncover the molecular pathway/s underlying S1P-induced secretion of IL-6, and investigate if, and how, corticosteroids inhibit IL-6 secretion. Using cultured ASM cells from non-asthmatics, we found that S1P induces IL-6 secretion from ASM cells via CRE, but not AP-1, C/EBP or NF-kB, transcriptional regulation of IL-6 gene expression. CRE-dependence was supported by S1P-induced CREB phosphorylation. Although the corticosteroid dexamethasone reduced S1P-induced IL-6 secretion in a dose-dependant manner, this inhibition appeared to occur via a pathway independent of CREB/CRE, suggesting the existence of a parallel pathway. As we recently discovered that the antiinflammatory actions of corticosteroids in ASM can be mediated via the induction of the endogenous mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), we investigated whether MAPK represents the parallel pathway targeted by corticosteroids. We found that S1P can induce activation of a variety of MAPK, however, only p38 MAPK phosphorylation was inhibited by dexamethasone; importantly, the increase in MKP-1 after corticosteroid treatment appeared to mirror the decrease in S1P-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, exogenous expression of MKP-1 inhibited S1Pinduced IL-6 secretion. Taken together, these results suggest that parallel pathways exist to induce IL-6 secretion (transcriptional via CREB/CRE and possibly post-transcriptional via p38 MAPK) and serve to underscore the importance of MKP-1 upregulation as a mechanism of action of corticocosteroids in ASM. Angiogenesis is a hallmark feature of asthma. Angiogenic promoters, such as VEGF and TGFb are reported to be increased in airways of asthmatics. Tumstatin, an endogenous angiogenic inhibitor, is the non-collagenous domain-1 (NC1) of the alpha3 chain of collagen IV. Decreased levels of collagen IV have been reported in the airways of asthmatics. We investigated the presence of tumstatin in the airway of asthmatics and its potential role as an angiogenic inhibitor. We detected the six a chain NC1domains of Col IV and the 7S domain of the a3 chain using immunohistochemistry. The level of tumstatin in serum and BAL-f was measured by dot blot. Western blots were used to identify the association with the rest of the collagen IV molecule. A tube formation assay using primary pulmonary endothelial cells (PPEC) was performed to evaluate the role of tumstatin in the airway. The effect of intranasal tumstatin on airway hyperresponsiveness and angiogenesis was studied in an ovalbumin mouse model. Tumstatin was absent in the airways of asthmatics (n = 14) while the remaining six collagen IV a chains were present. The 7S domain of the a3 chain was present in the asthmatic airway (n = 6). Tumstatin was detected in both serum and BAL-f samples from asthmatic volunteers (n = 10), however the level of expression was not significantly different from that in nonasthmatics (n = 7). In asthmatic serum tumstatin was part of the whole collagen IV a3 chain. Tumstatin was able to inhibit PPEC tube formation in a dose related manner. Tumstatin inhibited angiogenesis in the mice airways and was associated with an improvement in AHR. The fact that tumstatin is absent from asthmatic airways and inhibited airway hyperresponsiveness and angiogenesis may indicate potential for therapeutic intervention in airway remodelling.

Defective alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytic function in the airway may perpetuate inflammation via secondary necrosis of uncleared apoptotic cells in COPD. We have previously reported that low-dose azithromycin improved macrophage function in vitro, although the mechanisms for this effect were not identified.

Gp130 has been associated with the progression of fibrosis especially in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Gp130 is the common subunit of the receptor complexes for the IL-6 family of cytokines including IL-11 and oncostatin M (OSM), where gp130-mediated signalling leads to activation of the ERK or STAT pathways. We have previously demonstrated exaggerated gp130-STAT signalling to be fundamental to the development of pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the IL-6 cytokine family in the development of pulmonary fibrosis by identifying which IL-6 family cytokines regulate fibrosis in bleomycin treated mice, and determine the effects of these cytokines on cell function. Bleomycin (0.05 U/mouse) or control saline was administered intranasally to wildtype mice (wt), genetically engineered mice containing point mutations to prevent gp130 ERK signalling (gp130 757F ) or gp130 STAT signalling (gp130 DSTAT ), and duel IL-6 and IL-11 a-receptor knockout mice (IL-6 -/-;IL-11aR -/-). The effect of bleomycin on collagen production was examined in lung tissue 30 days post treatment by HPLC. There was a significant increase in collagen levels in bleomycin treated wt lungs which was further increased in gp130 757F lungs. The lungs of gp130 DSTAT and IL-6 -/-;IL-11aR -/mice were protected from fibrosis suggesting that gp130-STAT signalling is important in inducing lung fibrosis which may be mediated through IL-6 and/or IL-11. Cell proliferation was examined in lung fibroblasts isolated from wt, gp130 DSTAT and gp130 757F mice. IL-6, IL-11 and OSM were significantly mitogenic for gp130 DSTAT cells but not for wt or gp130 757F cells, reflecting different responses to the different signalling pathways. Changes in cytokine profiles are currently being examined in lung tissue and serum of control and bleomycin treated mice 0-30 days after treatment. In conclusion, IL-6 and IL-11 are likely to play a role in bleomycin-induced fibrosis via the gp130-STAT-mediated pathway, however this may not be due to regulation of proliferation induced by these cytokines.

Mimicking viral infection by application of various toll-like receptor ligands has shown clinical promise in the treatment of persistent viral infections and more recently with malignant tumours. Commercially available toll-like receptor 7 ligands (TLR7L), such as those of the Imidazoquinoline family have been applied clinically for the treatment of a number of conditions including basal cell carcinoma and HPV-induced genital warts. These compounds are known to retard tumour growth indirectly by promoting activation and migration of DCs, leading to a strong Th1 cellular response, and directly via release of proinflammatory cytokines and promotion of tumour cell apoptosis. Malignant mesothelioma (MM), an aggressive tumour with a mean survival of 9 months, is highly resistant to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery and is therefore an interesting candidate for immunotherapy in the form of TLR7 ligand treatment. Whilst TLR7 is known to be selectively expressed in immune cells and its relative expression low amongst other cell and tissue types in mammals, its expression on tumour cells and the consequences of such expression on tumour growth are unknown. Here we describe the presence of TLR7 (mRNA and protein) directly in a range of different tumours, including several murine and human MM cell lines. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during the innate immune response are important agents of anti-pathogen defense but may also cause oxidative lung damage. Glutathione peroxidase-1 (gpx-1) is a detoxifying enzyme that may protect lungs from such damage. Methods Wild-type (WT) or mice deficient in glutathione peroxidase-1 (gpx-1 -/-) were placed in a perspex chamber and exposed to cigarette (cig) smoke generated from 9 cigs per day for 4 days.

The aim of this study was to determine opinions and attitudes to exercise from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects after completion of a 12-month maintenance exercise program. Methods Following completion of a 12-month exercise study, which included a supervised program (Intervention, n = 18) and control group (Control, n = 17), COPD subjects [mean age (SD): 66 (8); mean FEV1 (% predicted) = 56% (19)] were asked to complete a questionnaire. The questionnaire included closedended questions using visual analogue scales (100 mm). In COPD the 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) is known to increase with test repetition (familiarization) and in response to exercise training. It is unknown whether the magnitudes of these increases are related to the degree of disability of the individual patient. Methods 6MWD was measured twice before and once after an 8 week out-patient exercise program in 121 patients (82 males) aged 67\u03ee8.6 yrs, FEV1 37\u03ee15% predicted (mean\u03eeSD) with stable COPD.

Conclusions Before training, 6MWD increases following a familiarization test irrespective of the level of disability. The magnitude of this increase is similar in all groups when normalized for their pre-training 6MWD. Following training, the increase in 6MWD is greatest in patients with the greatest disability (lowest pre-training 6MWD). In less disabled patients, the relatively smaller increase in 6MWD following training may reflect an inability to further increase stride length, thereby reducing the responsiveness of the 6MWT in this group.

The technique of skeletal muscle microbiopsy has previously been validated [1] and shown to be minimally invasive and well tolerated in participants with stable COPD. Aim A study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and tolerability of obtaining microbiopsy muscle samples from the patient admitted for acute exacerbation of COPD patient. Methods Written informed consent was obtained to collect the muscle, blood and sputum samples for research purposes. Local anaesthetic was injected prior to the insertion of a 16 gauge Bard Max Core Disposable Biopsy Instrument through the associated guide needle. Multiple passes (up to 6) were obtained. The patient was asked to evaluate the experience by rating it on the modified Borg scale 0-10. Results To date 5 patients and 3 controls have participated in this study. The GOLD severity ranged from 2-4 and ATS exacerbation severity 2-3. The mean age 75 years (range 68-83 years), BMI mean 23.6 kg m -2 (range 17.2-27.1 kg m -2 ) and fat free mass was determined using single frequency bioimpedance. The sample mass obtained ranged from 27.2-104.1 mg, with an increasing yield occurring with increased experience of the operator. The procedure has been well tolerated, the Borg scale rating ranged from 1-2/10. All patients were ambulant post procedure; no haematoma or bruising was observed in any of the subjects. Conclusion The microbiopsy technique allows the collection of muscle tissue with minimal discomfort to the participant. Small tissue masses such as these are sufficient to obtain measures of local markers of wasting and may prove to be a useful adjunct to the collection of sputum and blood for the measure of biomarkers in COPD research.

Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, and is characterized by elevated hydrogen ions, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is formed from the conversion of superoxide anions by superoxide dismutase. Airway pH has already been shown to be decreased in EBC of patients with other respiratory conditions, but not in lung cancer. Therefore the concentration of H2O2 and hydrogen ions in the EBC of lung cancer subjects was compared with matched controls. Methods Six subjects with newly diagnosed lung cancer were recruited and matched with control subjects: non-smokers, ex-smokers and smokers. EBC was collected and H2O2 was then measured by an assay method based on oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethybenzidine by horseradish peroxidase and H2O2 while pH was measured using a pH meter. Results There was a significant difference (p = 0.033, ANOVA) in H2O2 concentration between the 4 groups with the lung cancer group having elevated mean H2O2 concentration of 23.68 mM (9.15 (SEM) compared to the controls: non-smokers, 17.59 mM (6.53 (SEM); ex-smokers, 14.35 mM (3.79 (SEM); and smokers, 5.21mM (0.69 (SEM). pH did not differ significantly (p = 0.659, Kruskal-Wallis test) between the groups.

Local markers of the pulmonary vascular endothelium rather than traditional markers of thromobophilia are thought to be involved [3] .

No difference in the BMP level was observed between patients with PE and controls. Soluble BMPR-II receptor was lower in patients with PE than in controls or patients with DVT.

This study reviewed 14 cases of clinically diagnosed artPAH (idiopathic n = 12, associated with scleroderma n = 2), who had failed Bosentan therapy and had available lung tissue. Controls (n = 6) were obtained from explanted lungs for other causes and a prior transthoracic echocardiogram excluded pulmonary hypertension. Vessel morphometry and qualitative analysis was performed with a novel technique of smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry counterstained with Verhoeff's elastin. Baseline clinical data were retrieved. We found 86% of cases had pathology confirmed PVOD. Only 14% of cases had artPAH, the original clinical diagnosis. In PVOD, significant pathology was present in all vessel types. All vessels had significant smooth muscle hypertrophy. The obstructive, collagenous, pauci-cellular intimal fibrosis of the venules (p < 0.0001) and arterioles (p < 0.0001) was considerably different to the concentric laminar proliferation of smooth muscle observed in the muscular arteries (p < 0.0001) and arterioles (p = 0.001) in artPAH. artPAH also had muscular artery smooth muscle hypertrophy (p = 0.007). The median time to Bosentan failure was shorter in PVOD than artPAH (290 vs. 657 days). In conclusion, PVOD is an under-diagnosed cause of pulmonary hypertension, is commonly clinically misdiagnosed as artPAH and may present with a poor Bosentan therapy response. Finally, PVOD is a vaso-occlusive, not a veno-occlusive disease, and is an independent type of pulmonary hypertension, not a subtype of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Cutaneous T cell Lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogenous group of lymphoproliferative disorders. They show various clinical manifestations and diverse morphological, histological and immunological characteristics of the malignant cells. They are caused by clonally derived, skin invasive T cells. Peripheral T cell Lymphomas (PTCL) are generally more aggressive and have one of the lowest overall and failure-free survival rates. Because of the rarity of these disorders, diagnosis and treatment remain challenging. This case report describes a 69-year-old woman presenting with progressive dyspnoea and cough, together with a distressing generalized pruritic rash. She was initially treated as left ventricular failure with the rash ascribed to a drug reaction as suggested by initial skin biopsies.

Despite an initial response to chemotherapy she succumbed to the disease 20 months after diagnosis. Clinical pathways to guide the investigation of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have been increasingly adopted by emergency departments (ED) worldwide. Compliance with these diagnostic algorithms is critical in ensuring good patient outcomes. This study evaluated the compliance to the clinical pathway used in our ED that combines risk assessment (Wells scoring system) with D-dimer test, VQ scan or CTPA. The main objectives of this study were to identify those factors which contributed to compliance and to assess patient outcomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Management and Comments"}, {"text": "Methods A prospective observational study of 239 consecutive patients who underwent investigation for PE in our ED. Patient demographics, pathway parameters and patient outcomes at 3-month follow-up were collected. Case We report the case of a 37 year old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with a three day history of dry cough and dyspnoea. The patient was in her third pregnancy at 30 weeks gestation. She had no fever, chest pain or coryzal symptoms. The patient had presented with a right sided spontaneous pneumothorax seven months prior to the current presentation. Her past medical history included placental abruption, complicating her previous two pregnancies. Her second pregnancy was complicated by placental abruption at 27 weeks and the foetus had not survived. Her first pregnancy was complicated by placental abruption at 36 weeks with successful delivery of the foetus. At presentation, significant findings included tachycardia, hypoxemia, tachypnoea and reduced breath sounds over the right side of the chest. Chest x-ray demonstrated a large right pneumothorax. A right intercostal catheter was inserted resulting in right lung re-expansion. The catheter was removed three days later. The patient returned to hospital twenty four hours after catheter removal with a recurrent right sided pneumothorax. The patient agreed to surgical intervention involving video-assisted thoracotomy and talc pleurodesis. The patient had no further complications with the pregnancy. She delivered a healthy baby at 38 weeks gestation. Discussion Spontaneous pneumothorax in pregnancy is rare and there is little evidence to provide guidelines for the management of recurrent pneumothorax in high risk pregnancy. Our case illustrates a successful outcome for mother and foetus with surgical intervention at 32 weeks gestation. FOLFOX is currently the standard adjuvant treatment for locally advanced (stage III) colon cancer and increases disease free survival. Its toxicity is well tolerated with common adverse effects being paraesthesia, bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal disturbance. Pulmonary toxicity has rarely been reported. Three clinical cases of acute dyspnoea following FOLFOX therapy (2005) (2006) (2007) for stage III colon cancer are reported. All had an anterior resection followed by 11-12 cycles of FOLFOX. Each developed rapidly progressive dyspnoea requiring hospital admission within one week of their last cycle. One patient required invasive ventilation in ICU. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed bilateral widespread honeycomb pattern with associated ground glass opacification consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. They had reduced lung volumes and gas transfer. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage in one patient showed an acute eosinophilic pneumonitis. Other causes of interstitial lung disease were carefully excluded. All three patients received high dose corticosteroids with one receiving additional cyclophosphamide. The first patient showed complete recovery following an eight week course of corticosteroids, with resolution of the HRCT changes and improvement in lung function. The second had symptomatic improvement of dyspnoea, but a persistent moderate reduction in gas transfer. The final patient had persisting radiographic changes and a reduced gas transfer. He remained dependant on ambulatory oxygen 6 months after his initial presentation. These patients' interstitial lung disease appears due to FOLFOX with oxaliplatin being the most likely causative agent. The use of oxaliplatin chemotherapy has increased markedly over the last 3 years and although rare, physicians should be aware of its potential for lung toxicity. Lung function testing at baseline, during and towards the end of oxaliplatin treatment should be undertaken and may allow early detection and intervention in cases of pulmonary toxicity. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) with broadband signals has been employed relatively rarely in the studies on respiratory mechanics. Recent work from our laboratory [1] indicated that the cheek support and the neck angle have minor influence on the impedance spectra around the first antiresonance (far,1), which makes the use of the broadband FOT especially attractive in young children.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2223, "end": 2229, "text": "(2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2236, "text": "(2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2237, "end": 2243, "text": "(2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4078, "end": 4081, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PRE-TEST CLINICAL PROBABILITY OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS (PE) AND THE APPROPRIATE USE OF CTPA IN A TEACHING HOSPITAL"}, {"text": "Methods We studied 7 healthy children (C; female: 4) and 8 children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; female: 3), using multiple-frequency FOT between 8 and 256 Hz superimposed on spontaneous breathing.

Children with advanced lung disease being considered for lung transplantation are likely to spend disproportionately longer periods on transplant waiting lists before appropriately sized donor organs become available. These longer waiting times reflect the lower organ donation rates seen in children; rates that are significantly lower than those reported in the adult population. We describe two children with advanced lung disease who deteriorated whilst on the waiting list for lung transplantation, and in the absence of appropriately sized donor lungs, underwent lobar lung transplantation. Methods We describe the clinical course of two children, aged 9 and 13 years old, with advanced lung disease secondary to post-mycoplasma obliterative bronchiolitis and cystic fibrosis-associated bronchiectasis, respectively. Results Both children received a \"cutdown\" bilateral lobar transplant from two oversized adult brain-dead organ donors. In both cases the transplant operation involved implantation of the right middle and upper lobes, and of the left upper lobe from the donor. Conclusion Given the low organ donation rates in children, and in the absence of appropriately sized donor lungs, novel strategies such as lobar transplantation must be considered, particularly when children continue to clinically deteriorate whilst on the lung transplant waiting list. Data from the West Australian adult outcomes of extreme preterm birth study suggest that adult survivors of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) may be left with functional and structural pulmonary abnormalities, most notably emphysema. Animal data suggest that the antenatal administration of corticosteroids may adversely affect lung development. We therefore sought to determine if maternal variables, including administration of corticosteroid, could predict emphysema severity in adulthood. Methods BPD subjects (birthweight < 1500 g and oxygen dependence at 36 weeks post-menstrual age) born prior to 1988 were identified and recruited prospectively via the statewide neonatal follow up program as previously described. Pulmonary function tests and thin selective inspiratory and expiratory computerised (CT) images were acquired and scored for emphysema severity (voxel index (%)). The obstetric history was obtained from retrospective review of case notes. Results 21 adults (12 females, aged 18-34) were studied, 2 declined CT. All subjects had abnormal CT findings. Fifteen (79%) had areas of emphysema. Emphysema score and FEV1 were not influenced by the administration of antenatal corticosteroids, indication for delivery, maternal age or presence or absence of chorioamnionitis. Conclusion Maternal factors, including the administration of antenatal corticosteroids, do not predict the long term respiratory outcome of BPD. The factors determining the severity of emphysema in this group remain unknown. The prevalence of childhood asthma is high in the Torres Strait. Children have generally more severe asthma and asthma knowledge is poor. However, there is no culturally appropriate asthma education program for these children. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial to examine the additional benefits of an education intervention by Indigenous Health Care Workers (HCW) on asthma outcomes. We describe the study's objectives, design and baseline measurements. Methods Children with wheeze were reviewed by two paediatric respiratory physicians using a standardized protocol; children with asthma were eligible. After obtaining informed consent children were randomly allocated to: (1) three additional asthma education sessions with a HCW; or (2) no additional education from a HCW. Trained HCWs carried out the education sessions using culturally appropriate tools. Primary outcome was the number of unscheduled hospital/doctor visits due to asthma exacerbation. All children were re-assessed at 12 months. Results We enrolled 113 children aged 1 to 17 years, 81% were Torres Strait Islanders and 12% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The clinical spectrum of asthma was: 51% infrequent episodic asthma, 22% frequent episodic asthma and 27% chronic asthma. Eighteen percent of the children knew what a written Asthma Action Plan was; 8.5% had one. Carers' assessment of knowledge of medications showed that 52% could not name any asthma medication used by their child, 40% could not explain dosage, and 67% could not explain how beta2 agonists worked. Conclusions Asthma knowledge and possession of asthma action plans in this cohort is poor at baseline. There is substantial room for improvement and additional asthma education by HCWs potentially has significant benefits. Impulse Oscillometry System (IOS) measures respiratory function during normal breathing by transmitting mixed frequency rectangular pressure impulses down the airways and measuring reflected pressure. Computer analysis calculates respiratory impedance and its components, airways resistance and reactance, at a range of frequencies from 0.1 Hz to 150 Hz. No previous Australian normative data exists. The IOS software generates predictive normal values for each of the parameters measured including total airway resistance (R5), the proximal airway resistance (R20) as well as peripheral capacitive reactance (X5). However, they are based on German data. Methods Cross-sectional study of 100 community dwelling adults, with 10 males and females per 10-year cohort. Inclusion criteria: age range 25-74 years, apparently good respiratory health. Exclusion criteria: smokers, asthmatics and others with acute or chronic respiratory disease. Both IOS and spirometry were conducted on all participants. Results Australian predictive normal equations have been generated and compared to the current published equations. The IOS parameters have been correlated with the spirometric data. Results have been analysed by gender, age, height and weight and compared with the predictive normal values for each parameter provided by the German manufacturer of the IOS instrument. Analysis includes calculation of mean range, and lower limit of normal. Conclusions A preliminary set of Australian predictive equations have now been produced for the IOS. These have been compared with international equations. IOS has potential application in a range of respiratory disease states and in population screening for occupational health (e.g. mining, & high dust load environments). Supported by PHC RED. Rationale Although clinical practice guidelines for both asthma and COPD recommend spirometry for diagnosis and monitoring, beneficial effects on the management of chronic respiratory diseases in general practice have not been established. We hypothesized that spirometry would improve health outcomes compared to usual care. Methods We are conducting a single masked RCT with 3 arms: Group A receive 3 monthly spirometry and followup, Group B receive spirometry before and after the trial and Group C usual care. 45 general practices were recruited though Divisions of General Practice in Melbourne. Invitations were mailed by 31 of these practices to patients who had been prescribed inhaled medications during the previous 6 months. Participants returned respiratory and generic quality of life questionnaires and an asthma score card. Groups A and B were tested on a MicroMedical turbine spirometer following ATS/ERS guidelines. Results 351 eligible patients (275 adults, 50 children aged 8-13 and 26 youths aged 14-17 years) entered the trial. 122 were randomized to Group A, 134 to Group B and 95 to Group C. The mean (SD) age of adult participants was 54.3 (12.7), children 10.3 (1.7) and youths 15 (1.1) years. There were 130 males and 221 females. The adults were highly symptomatic in the previous 12 months: 82% reporting wheeze, 50% chest tightness on waking, 74% shortness of breath on exertion, 61% nocturnal cough, 46% morning cough and 75% sputum. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis were reported by 39% of adults and a diagnosis of COPD by 19%. Asthma was reported by 84%, confirmed by a doctor in 96% and 55% had experienced an attack in the last 12 months. Only 35% had a written asthma action plan. 37% of adults had ever visited a hospital ED and 28% had been admitted. Conclusion It is possible to recruit asthma and COPD patients from general practice and to randomize them to spirometry or usual care. Whether spirometry is associated with fewer symptoms, changes in medication, uptake of action plans or improvement in lung function or quality of life requires further followup.

In this paper, we discuss the recruitment experience from a current study evaluating the impact of an educational asthma intervention on patient outcomes. Our aim is to describe the two different strategies utilized to date: (1) in-house through an academic department of GP and (2) outsourced to a private GP organization. Methods Initial interest was generated through faxes, presentations at GP Divisional meetings and newsletter advertisements. GPs who expressed interest were visited by project staff to discuss the study further. A major difference was recruiting one GP per practice in the first strategy versus multiple GPs per practice in the second strategy. To assess the strategies, we examined participant characteristics, number of GPs recruited and number retained. Results Participant characteristics: Under both strategies, 30% of recruits had trained in Asia and 54% were women. The first strategy recruited more GPs who spoke at least two languages at home (85% vs 42%) and the second strategy recruited more recently graduated GPs (58% vs 50%). Recruitment: The first strategy recruited 35 GPs over 6 months and the second recruited 34 GPs over 3 months. Retention: 19 GPs (54%) from the first strategy stayed in, compared to 29 (85%) from the second. Conclusions Whilst absolute numbers of GPs recruited were similar, retention was much higher under the second strategy. Recruitment in primary care is difficult and requires a range of approaches which need to be re-evaluated and adapted as necessary during the course of the study.

The classification of this condition is often confusing and hard to remember. The aim of this study was to classify non-CF bronchiectasis into different clinical phenotypes. Methods 178 consecutive patients with non-CF bronchiectasis confirmed on high resolution CT scanning had a detailed clinical, spirometric and laboratory assessment performed by a respiratory physician (PK/MF/PW) and were then followed up for an average of 9 \u03ee 4 years (mean and SD) for a total of over 2000 reviews.

Methods Data linkage was performed within the NSW Department of Health TB notifications database to identify cases that had more than one TB notification between 1994 and 2006. Recurrent tuberculosis was defined to include all patients with two or more culture positive episodes at least 6 months apart, where patients had received at least six months treatment for the initial episode. In cases where data contained within the notification details was not sufficient to allow us to distinguish between true cases of recurrent disease, duplication notification for the same episode or persistent disease after incomplete treatment, additional information was obtained from the Area TB coordinator.

Methods HeLa cells were infected with RV or transfected with plasmids and cellular localization of 3C analysed at various times thereafter using immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and Western blotting with specific antibodies.

The nuclear export signal is inhibited in the full length protein, via an unknown mechanism. Conclusion Our data suggest that 3C and 3CD proteins localize to the nucleus in infected cells where they may play a key role in RV pathogenesis by disrupting cellular transcription and the nuclear transport machinery. Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) is a relatively uncommon, sub-acute, locally destructive process due to Aspergillus invasion of the lung.

Human influenza virus is found to bind preferentially to SAa2,6GAL receptors found in the upper respiratory tract, while avian viruses bind to SAa2,3GAL receptors expressed in lower airways. This is thought to affect the ability of transmission to humans. Our aim was to study the ability of avian and human influenza strains to infect bronchial epithelial cells and relate this to levels of the sialic acid receptor expression. Methods Calu-3 cells were used as a proximal airway cell and A549 were used as distal airway cell. Human primary bronchial epithelial cells (pBECs) were obtained from healthy, asthmatic, and COPD volunteers by endobronchial brushing. Epithelial cells were stained with Sambucus nigra lectin that binds SAa2,6Gal receptor, and maackia amurensis lectin II that binds to SAa2,3Gal. The cells was analysed by flow cytometry.

Background Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia remains based on 'best guess' empiric algorithms because of the poor utility of current pathogen tests.

BRS was negatively related to both AHI and AI via fitted exponential functions (r 2 = 0.45 and 0.70, respectively).

To the authors' knowledge the published ECG based algorithms for detecting sleep disordered breathing are only capable of minute by minute analysis rather than detection of individual respiratory events. Methods Changes to ECG parameters were investigated during respiratory events with no distinction made between apnoea and hypopnoea events. 632 isolated respiratory events and 1264 controls of identical duration were obtained from 7 polysomnographic studies, using a randomized procedure. Features such as the R wave amplitude, T wave amplitude, QRS area and the R-R interval were extracted from the 2 lead ECG. A number of physiological predictors based on these features were generated.

Conclusion Our interim data suggest that the rate of subjective sleep complaints are not substantially different in the population with tetraplegia compared with the able-bodied. This research was supported by the Victorian Neurotrauma Initiative. It has long been assumed that the ventilation heterogeneity associated with lung disease could in itself affect the measurement of carbon monoxide transfer factor. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential estimation errors of carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (TLco) measurement that are specifically due to conductive ventilation heterogeneity. We induced conductive airway ventilation heterogeneity in 35 never-smoker normal subjects by histamine provocation, and related the resulting changes in ventilation heterogeneity (derived from the multiple breath washout test) to corresponding changes in diffusing capacity, alveolar volume and inspired vital capacity (derived from the single breath TLco method). Average conductive ventilation heterogeneity doubled (p < 0.001), while TLco decreased by 6% (p < 0.001), with no correlation between individual data (p > 0.1). When dividing diffusing capacity by alveolar volume, the resulting transfer coefficient was not significantly different pre versus post histamine (p = 0.074). These findings can be brought in agreement with recent modelling work, where specific ventilation heterogeneity resulting from different distributions of either inspired volume or end-expiratory lung volume have been shown to affect TLco estimation errors in opposite ways. The combination of these errors appears to largely cancel out in our experimental situation of induced ventilation heterogeneity comparable to that observed in lung disease. We conclude that conductive ventilation heterogeneity per se has a negligible effect on diffusing capacity measurement.

Results RV16 infection stimulated IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression, which was further elevated (2-fold) by transient upregulation of EGFR levels. Detection of viral RNA by QPCR confirmed that enhanced expression was not associated with increased viral replication. EGFR ligands (epiregulin, amphiregulin and HB-EGF) were induced by RV16 infection and inhibition of metalloproteases responsible for ligand shedding partially suppressed this response. The EGFR inhibitor AG1478, completely blocked IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression to basal levels, as did the specific Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 blocked IL-8 secretion but not ICAM-1 expression, whereas the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin was ineffective in both responses. Kinase inactive K721R EGFR which is selectively deficient in STAT signaling reversed RV16 responses associated with EGFR over-expression. Conclusions RV16 infection rapidly promotes induction of EGFR/HER ligands. EGFR activity is required for IL-8 and ICAM-1 induction and elevated EGFR levels augment this response. Erk1/2 is a major EGFR effector pathway and STAT factors coordinate gene expression associated with EGFR overexpression.

Furthermore, we hypothesized that lys-des[Arg 9 ]-BK, which is produced during inflammation play a role in mature DC (mDC) migration and that both receptors could be down-regulated and DC-migration decreased with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). We also compared the migration index of DC from healthy and asthmatic subjects. Methods DC were derived from PBMC isolated from the blood of healthy and asthmatic subjects. B1R and B2R expression was assessed by confocal microscopy and RT-PCR. Migration of Mo-DC was assessed in transwell chambers. Chemoattractant used: BK, Lys-des[Arg 9 ]-BK, RANTES and CCL19. Results Lys-des[Arg 9 ]-BK, which is produced during inflammation, acts through the B1 receptor (B1R) and play a role in mDC migration, which is decreased when DC are pre-incubated with kinin. Lovastatin reduced kininsmediated migration by~50% and chemokine-mediated migration up to~65%. Interestingly, DC isolated from asthmatics showed greater motility and increased sensitivity to inhibition by statin (up to 77%). Conclusions Kinins may play a crucial role in the regulation of DC migration in vivo. BK attract migration of iDC, whereas the increased formation of Lysdes[Arg 9 ]-BK in inflammation may decrease the migration of mDC toward certain chemoattractants and to the draining lymph nodes. Statins, which down-regulate expression of kinin and chemokine receptors and decrease DC migration, may potentially be useful as therapeutic agents in inflammatory diseases.THE ROLE OF THE HEDGEHOG PATHWAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA (MM)L GENOVESI 1 , C THOMAS 2 , SE MUTSAERS 1,2 1 Lung Institute of Western Australia, and 2 PathWest Laboratory Medicine WAMalignant Mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive tumour predominantly of the pleura with a latency period of up to 40 years and is associated with poor prognosis. Current research is focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying MM development to identify new targets for therapy, with increasing evidence pointing to the role of developmental pathways. The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is significant in a variety of tumours, with a high incidence of mutations resulting in its constitutive activation, further depicting a clear role for HH signaling. The role of HH signaling in MM and whether or not an aberration in this pathway plays a role in the molecular pathogenesis of MM remains to be determined. We hypothesize that the development of MM is determined, at least in part, upon HH signaling. To test this hypothesis, the mRNA expression levels of key HH signaling pathway proteins SHH, IHH, PTCH, SMO, GLI1 by real time PCR in 2 human primary mesothelial cell cultures and 5 human MM cell lines. All cells expressed mRNA for PTCH, SMO and GLI1. IHH was not expressed. SHH was only expressed in one human MM cell line, suggesting that in MM, HH pathway activation is likely to be predominantly paracrine driven. In addition, there was significantly higher mRNA levels of most HH-associated genes in malignant compared with normal mesothelial cells. Interestingly, the downstream molecule GLI1 was expressed at significantly high levels in human MM cell lines LO and NO. LO was the only cell line to express SHH mRNA. NO did not express SHH but produced the highest levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), a cytokine considered to be important in MM growth and the only other molecule shown to stimulate GLI expression independent of SMO. The interaction between the HH and TGF-b signalling pathways are incidently being investigated. In conclusion, the elevated mRNA levels of the HH signalling pathway components in MM cells is strong evidence of the potential role of HH signalling in MM.EFFECT OF STEROIDS ON TGF-\u00df1-INDUCED EPITHELIAL TO MESENCHYMAL CELL TRANSITION (EMT)T HARRIS, M SCHULIGA, A STEWART Department of Pharmacology, University of Melbourne,Parkville, Vic. 3010", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF38": {"text": "INCREASED INTRACELLULAR LEUCOCYTE PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE/CHEMOKINE EXPRESSION IN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA -IS CPAP THERAPY WORKING?", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF39": {"text": "HUMORAL IMMUNITY TO NONTYPEABLE HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAEP KING 1,2 , J NGUI 1 , M FARMER 2 , P HOLMES 2 , S HOLDSWORTH1  1  Monash University Department ofMedicine, and 2 Respiratory Medicine,  Monash Medical Centre/Southern Health, Clayton, VIC, 3168    Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major cause of respiratory disease, particularly chronic bronchitis. It almost never causes systemic infection and has been shown to be capable of living intracellularly. The investigators have previously described a high prevalence of seroconversion to NTHi in both controls and bronchiectasis subjects. The aim of this study was to assess whether humoral immunity to NTHi may have a role in preventing systemic infection. Methods Serum was obtained from 10 control subjects and 10 bronchiectasis patients (with chronic NTHi infection). All 20 serum samples had detectable antibody to NTHi. Ten different isolates of live NTHi were then incubated with the 10% serum for 2 hours and the effect of killing assessed by the number of colony forming units (compared with control). The effect of complement depleted serum and rabbit serum (which lacked antibody to NTHi) was assessed. The effect of serum killing of NTHi was also assessed by electron microscopy.ResultsThe results demonstrated that all 10 strains of NTHi were killed by the 20 different subject serum specimens; all 200 experiments demonstrated significant killing of NTHi (with a mean reduction of >99.9% after 2 hours compared to control). C5, 6 and 8 depleted serum did not kill NTHi but when C5 C6 and C8 was added to the depleted serum >99.9% reduction in NTHi numbers occurred suggested that killing was mediated through the terminal attack complex of complement. Electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of pores in bacterial membranes after the addition of serum confirming the role of the terminal attack complex. Rabbit serum did not have any effect on NTHi numbers. Blockage of the classical complement pathway by EGTA abolished serum killing. Conclusion NTHi is very susceptible to extracellular killing by antibody and the terminal attack complex of complement. The results may explain why NTHi rarely causes systemic infection and the potential role of intracellular survival.THE ROLE OF THE IL-6 FAMILY OF CYTOKINES IN BLEOMYCIN-INDUCED LUNG FIBROSIS AND PROLIFERATIONHL LAU 1 , R O'DONOGHUE 1 , M ERNST 2 , D KNIGHT 3 , S MUTSAERS 1,4 1 Lung Inst. of WA,2 Ludwig Inst. for Cancer Research, Victoria, 3 University of  British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada,and 4 Pathwest Laboratory Medicine WA", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF42": {"text": "Conclusions BECs from subjects with moderate to severe COPD release less IL-8 in response to RV infection and exposure to LPS and TNFa.

Sydney, NSW 2031, and 2 Department of Infectious Diseases, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, NSW 2031Influenza A or B can cause an acute respiratory illness, mainly during the winter months. In the community the diagnosis of influenza can be made using clinical criteria once an outbreak is established; whereas in hospital an accurate diagnosis is essential for infection control measures. Rapid viral diagnostic tests, e.g. immunofluorescence (IF) assays, enzyme immunoassays (EIA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests may be appropriate alternatives to the gold standard of laboratory viral cultures. Point of care RAT allows rational use of antiviral therapy both for patient treatment and prophylaxis of health care workers and family contacts. Methods During the winter months July to September 2007, subjects were recruited on the basis of fever with at least one respiratory and constitutional symptom. In addition to standard clinical evaluation and chest x-ray, an anterior nasal swap was collected. Using the QuickVue A+B test, a RAT kit using monoclonal antibodies specific for influenza A and B virus antigens, a result was available within 15 minutes. Results We recruited 125 subjects through emergency, respiratory and infectious diseases departments. Of these, 12 results returned positive, with 11 being Influenza A and 1 being Influenza B. RAT costs $30 per testing, compared with $150 for a laboratory EIA/viral culture. Conclusions Previous standard of care was for laboratory EIA with turnover time of 24-72 hours. Our rapid results allowed prompt clinical decisions and early intervention such as antiviral therapy for patient and contacts and isolation of cases. It may also prove to be cost effective.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical assessment of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). Methods 50 CTPA were reviewed. Results 31 female, 19 male. Mean age 50 yrs (range 21-87). 26 CTPA requests came from Department of Medicine, 21 from Emergency Department, 2 from surgical teams and 1 from oncology outpatients. 36 patients presented with chest pain (pleuritic in 20 cases), 25 had dyspnea, 7 presented with collapse. 4 patients had haemoptysis. Hypoxaemia was recorded in 7. None were clinically shocked and only one had a recorded tachycardia. D-dimer requested in 10 patients and was elevated in 9. Arterial blood gases performed in only 10 patients (20%). 47 patients had prior chest X-ray which was normal in 24 (48%). 8 patients had consolidation on chest X-ray, 2 pleural effusions, 2 atelectasis and 1 fractured ribs. Recorded risk factors included 4 patients with previous DVT or PE, 4 patients with malignancy and 6 patients were immediately post-operative. Only 6 CTPAs (12%) demonstrated evidence of PE.

Understanding the role of AHR in sarcoidosis, if any, may help to identify individuals who might benefit from inhaled therapies. Aims (1) To determine the prevalence of AHR in sarcoidosis. (2) To determine the correlation between responses to direct (using histamine) and indirect (using hypertonic saline) bronchial challenge. (3) To determine the clinical, physiological and radiological predictors of AHR. Methods Subjects with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis based on typical clinical presentation and compatible HRCT features and/or tissue biopsy and with a baseline FEV1>35% predicted were recruited. Subjects underwent standard hypertonic (15% fall in FEV1) and histamine (20% fall in FEV1) challenge (>1 day but <7 days apart), lung function testing and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. Results The 52 subjects (48 \u03ee 11 years, 35% female, 92% European, 35% Stage I, 25% Stage II, 40% Stage III, 0% Stage IV) had well preserved lung function overall (FEV1 = 2.8L \u03ee 0.7.87% predicted). AHR was detected in 5/47 (11%) to hypertonic saline and 19/43 (44%) to histamine challenge. On univariate analysis, response to histamine challenge was predicted by conglomerate fibrosis (p = 0.002) and reticular pattern (p = 0.05) on HRCT. The baseline % predicted FEV1 was significantly associated with AHR on univariate (p = 0.004), and multivariate analysis (p = 0.01) when adjusted by HRCT patterns. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of AHR using histamine challenge in this study of sarcoidosis subjects. AHR most strongly associates with baseline % predicted FEV1 but also conglomerate fibrosis and reticular pattern on HRCT. These findings may reflect the consequence of airway remodelling following inflammation. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Background Upper airway shunt represents a significant source of measurement artefact in the use of the forced oscillation technique (FOT), with increasing importance in young children. Changes in respiratory system admittance, Ars (or Zrs -1 ), are theoretically independent of the upper airway shunt. This study examines the possible clinical benefit of Ars in preschool children by assessing any increased ability to differentiate responses to bronchial challenges in the routine clinical setting. We hypothesized the use of Ars would provide improved sensitivity to clinically relevant obstruction, bronchodilator responsiveness (BDR) and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in young children with respiratory disease. Method Previous FOT measurements were re-analysed and Ars calculated to derive: (1) Ars reference equations in healthy young children (n = 158); (2) BDR in Ars, respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) in healthy children (n = 78), children with cystic fibrosis (n = 39), neonatal chronic lung disease (n = 49), asthma (n = 56) and wheeze (n = 66); (3) AHR to inhaled adenosine-5\u2032-monosphate (AMP) in 19 children. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess changes in diagnostic outcomes between Ars and conventional FOT outcomes (Rrs and Xrs). Results Ars was no more sensitive to bronchodilator induced changes than conventional FOT outcomes. AMP challenges resulted in equivalent responses measured by relative changes in Rrs and Ars while absolute changes in Ars were the least sensitive variable. Conclusion This study does not support a clinical advantage in using Ars in measuring responses to either inhaled bronchodilator or AMP.

This information is usually obtained from a sample of arterial blood (ABG). The procedure can be painful and distressing for patients, and is sometimes technically difficult due to obesity or contractures. Our aim was to determine the validity and feasibility of arterialized venous blood (AV) sampling as an alternative to ABGs in measuring PaCO2, pH and HCO3levels in patients with chronic HRF. Method Eighteen patients completed the study. Venous blood was arterialized by heating forearm skin to a temperature of 42-45\u00b0C with an electric heating pad. An AV sample was taken from a cannula positioned in a vein of the heated forearm simultaneously with an ABG. In addition, the reliability of AV sampling within the recommended temperature range (42-45\u00b0C) was investigated in ten healthy volunteers placed on volume cycled ventilation in order to maintain constant ventilation. AV samples were taken at 0.5\u00b0C temperature intervals from 42.5-45\u00b0C Results The table below summarizes results for validation of AV sampling: Based on the evidence that cardiovascular dynamics are altered due to obstructive sleep apnea, this study aims to identify the onset and termination of each apnea event using power spectral density (PSD) and morphological features of single lead ECG signal over 5 second period. Methods ECGs from 4 patients overnight sleep studies were examined for location of the pre-scored apnea events. Onset (n = 1995), maximum (n = 6751) and termination (n = 1996) of each apnea event and normal events (n = 11219) were annotated on 5 second windows. Features extracted were PSD, amplitudes of R and T wave of 5 second ECGs. Receiver operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to gauge the event recognition ability of all features. Weight loss causes an improvement in the severity of OSA, however substantial weight loss is very difficult for obese patients. The Very Low Caloric Diet (VLCD) has been shown to be successful in causing significant weight loss in obese patients. This is a pilot study on the use of a formal screening protocol to identify OSA patients who are potentially eligible for the supervised VLCD program offered by the Endocrinology Department at Auckland City Hospital. Method 344 consecutive patients who attended the sleep laboratory at ACH between June to December 2006 were screened using the protocol. Patients who are eligible to be considered for the VLCD program are identified as having a combination of obesity (BMI > 30), OSA (AHI > 5 on sleep study) and being residents within the Auckland District Healthboard region.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 293, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 345, "end": 348, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3699, "end": 3714, "text": "Respiratory and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3715, "end": 3774, "text": "Sleep Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, NSW 2050, and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3775, "end": 3825, "text": "2 Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, NSW 2050", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Departments of 1 Respiratory Services and 2 Radiology, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand"}, {"text": "Results 243/ 344 patients screened did not fulfil the inclusion criteria: 171 lived outside the ADHB region; 71 had BMI < 30; 7 patients did not have OSA (AHI < 5). 101 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. 54/101 patients (54%) were excluded due to medical or psychiatric contraindications to VLCD.47 patients (47%) who did not have contraindications to VLCD were contacted. 33 patients were contacted successfully. 14 patients were either unavailable to phone contacts on 3 separate days or were disconnected. 12/101 patients consented to being referred (12%). 21/101 patients declined referral (21%).
