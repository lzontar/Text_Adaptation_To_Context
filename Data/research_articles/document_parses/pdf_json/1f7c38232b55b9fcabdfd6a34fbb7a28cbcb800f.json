            "text": "It has emerged that DDX3 plays a role in antiviral innate immunity. However, the exact mechanism by which DDX3 functions in antiviral innate immunity remains to be determined. We found that the expression of the protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT) was regulated by DDX3 in human cells. PACT acts as a cellular activator of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors in the sensing of viral RNAs. DDX3 facilitated the translation of PACT mRNA that may contain a structured 5 0 UTR. Knockdown of DDX3 decreased the viral RNA detection sensitivity of the cells. PACT partially rescued defects of interferon-b1 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5/RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) induction in DDX3-knockdown HEK293 cells. Therefore, DDX3 may participate in antiviral innate immunity, at least in part, by translational control of PACT. Moreover, we show that overexpression of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein inhibited the translation of a reporter mRNA harboring the PACT 5 0 UTR. The HCV core protein was associated and colocalized with DDX3 in cytoplasmic stress granules, suggesting that the HCV core may abrogate the function of DDX3 by sequestering DDX3 in stress granules. The perturbation of DDX3 by viral proteins delineates a critical role for DDX3 in antiviral host defense.",

            "text": "RNA helicases of the DEAD-box protein family play multiple roles in almost all aspects of RNA metabolism [1, 2] . They use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to unwind RNA-duplex structures or remodel RNA-protein complexes [1, 2] . Human DDX3 is a member of the DEAD-box protein family. DDX3 and its yeast homolog Ded1 have been implicated in various RNA metabolism, including transcription [3, 4] , pre-mRNA splicing [5] [6] [7] , mRNA transport [8, 9] and translation initiation [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The role of DDX3 in translation initiation appears to be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans [21] . In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Ded1 is involved in the translational control of two B-type cyclins: Cig2 and Cdc13 [22] . Notably, Cig2 mRNA has an unusually long 5 0 UTR, whereas the 5 0 UTR of Cdc13 mRNA is predicted to contain a complex RNA secondary structure. Consistent with this notion, we found that human DDX3 is required for efficient translation of mRNAs that contain a long or structured 5 0 UTR in mammalian cells [13] [14] [15] . Given that the RNA helicase activity of DDX3 is required for its function in translational control [13] [14] [15] , we propose that DDX3 may facilitate ribosome scanning by resolving secondary structures in the 5 0 UTR of selected mRNAs during translation initiation.",

Viral infections are mainly detected by the host's pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll-like receptors and the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which recognize different classes of viral nucleic acids and metabolites at the surface of cells, within endosomes or in the cytoplasm [34] . The sensing of viral infections through PRRs leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I interferons (IFN-a/b), which are required for the elimination of viruses. The activation of PRRs triggers intracellular signaling cascades that in turn up-regulate transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB) and interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7 (IRF3/7) [35] . NF-jB controls many genes of inflammatory cytokines, whereas IRF3/7 are mainly responsible for the expression of type I IFNs.",

For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is sensed by cytoplasmic RLRs that recognize pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the viral RNA genome [36, 37] . However, most people infected with HCV eventually develop a persistent or chronic infection. HCV can circumvent the host's antiviral innate immunity via the actions of the viral NS3/4A protease [38] and the HCV core protein [30] . The HCV NS3/4A protease cleaves the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to prevent signal transduction of the RIG-I signaling pathway [38] . The HCV core protein suppresses type I IFN induction via its interactions with STAT1 [39] and DDX3 [30] . Similarly, vaccinia virus protein K7 and hepatitis B virus polymerase also inhibit IFN-b induction by targeting host DDX3 [31, 40] . The finding of DDX3 as a target of viral proteins for immune evasion highlights the importance of DDX3 in antiviral innate immunity.",

In the present study, we show that DDX3 was required for efficient translation of PACT mRNA in human cells. Knockdown of DDX3 resulted in impaired antiviral innate immune responses. PACT partially rescued defects of IFN-b and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5)/RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) induction in DDX3-knockdown cells.

Among these mRNA targets of DDX3, we found that several candidates are involved in antiviral innate immunity, including PACT. To confirm whether PACT is regulated by DDX3, we examined the expression of PACT in DDX3-knockdown cells and mock-treated cells. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the protein level of DDX3 was significantly reduced in HeLa and HEK293 cells transduced with either of DDX3-targeting shRNAs (Fig. 1A ,B, lanes 2-3) of which shDDX3-2 was more effective than shDDX3-1 in inhibiting DDX3 expression. Cyclin E1 has been identified as a translational target of DDX3 and thus serves as a positive control [15] . As observed with cyclin E1, the level of PACT protein considerably declined in DDX3-knockdown cells (Fig. 1A,B) , suggesting that DDX3 may control the expression of PACT protein. We also evaluated PACT and cyclin E1 protein levels in DDX3-overexpressing HeLa cells. Both PACT and cyclin E1 protein levels were up-regulated by DDX3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C ). PACT and cyclin E1 protein levels were increased by up to four-and five-fold in accordance with the levels of DDX3 overexpression in HeLa cells using a-tubulin as a normalization factor (Fig. 1C) . The results confirmed our notion that PACT is regulated by DDX3.",

Changes in the translation of reporter mRNAs were assessed by the relative Fluc/Rluc activity in DDX3-knockdown cells compared to mock-treated cells.

LPS-induced IFN-b1 and CCL5/RANTES expression was also impaired in DDX3-knockdown HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A , lanes 9-10). By contrast, expression of the cytokine TNF-a was not significantly affected by DDX3 knockdown in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A) . This result supported a role of DDX3 in innate immunity. Next, we evaluated whether PACT can rescue the defect of impaired IFN-b1 and CCL5/RANTES induction caused by DDX3 knockdown. Immunoblotting analysis showed that knockdown of DDX3 by shDDX3-2 down-regulated PACT expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5B, lane 3) . Transient expression of FLAG-tagged PACT restored PACT level in DDX3-knockdown HEK293 cells (Fig. 5B, lane 4) . To test whether PACT can rescue the defect of IFN-b1 and CCL5/RANTES induction in DDX3-knockdown cells, we transfected poly(I:C) or the HCV PAMP RNA into HEK293 cells to induce antiviral innate immunity. The production of IFN-b1, CCL5/ RANTES and TNF-a mRNAs was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using b-actin for normalization (Fig. 5C ). Knockdown of DDX3 showed an approximate 80% reduction in the IFN-b1 and CCL5/RANTES induction in HEK293 cells transfected with poly(I:C) or the HCV PAMP RNA, whereas PACT partially rescued their expression (Fig. 5C, lanes 3-4) . By contrast, transient expression of FLAG-tagged PACT did not rescue impaired IFN-b1 and CCL5/RANTES induction in DDX3knockdown HEK293 cells treated with bacterial LPS (Fig. 5C, lanes 3-4) . These results indicated that DDX3 participates in antiviral immune response, at least partly, through translational control of PACT protein expression. ",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the impaired IFN-b induction by the HCV core protein has not yet been fully defined. We assumed that the HCV core protein may bind to DDX3 and abrogate its function in antiviral innate immunity through translational control of PACT. To address this possibility, we examined the effects of HCV core on the translation of a reporter mRNA containing the PACT 5 0 UTR by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of GFP-tagged HCV core, a matured form of HCV core from the HCV-1b genotype [51] , reduced the relative Fluc/Rluc activity without changing the level of the reporter mRNAs (Fig. 6A) . We also demonstrated that GFP-tagged HCV core associates with endogenous DDX3 in HEK293 cells by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6B ). This suggests that the HCV core protein may inhibit the translation of PACT mRNA by binding to DDX3. According to our previous study [14] , DDX3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and recruited to cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) under stress conditions. We also observed that GFP-tagged HCV core was mostly colocalized with DDX3 in cytoplasmic SGs (Fig. 6C) , which accumulate stalled translation initiation complexes. Consistent with this notion, colocalization of GFP-tagged HCV core with SG marker proteins eIF4A and HuR was observed in cytoplasmic SGs (Fig. 6C) , suggesting that the HCV core protein may inhibit the function of DDX3 in antiviral innate immunity through a translational mechanism. In addition to cytoplasmic SGs, colocalization of GFP-tagged HCV core with nucleolin (NCL) in the nucleolus was also observed (Fig. 6C ).",

In the present study, we show, for the first time, that DDX3 regulates PACT expression by promoting the translation of PACT mRNA, which likely harbors a structured 5 0 UTR (Figs 1-4) . Our results thus provide another layer of evidence indictaing that DDX3 participates in antiviral innate immunity through regulation of PACT protein level. The accumulation of PACT mRNA in the fractions containing 40S ribosomal subunits in DDX3-knockdown cells (Fig. 3) supports the view that DDX3 participates in ribosome scanning of PACT mRNA during translation initiation.",

Our results indicate that the impairment of innate immunity observed in DDX3knockdown cells was likely a result of the downregulation of PACT. PACT can partially rescue the impaired innate immunity caused by DDX3 depletion (Fig. 5) . In agreement with a previous study [41] , we suggest that DDX3 functions in the sensing of viral infection. Many viruses have evolved various strategies for evading detection by both innate and adaptive immune responses. HCV can utilize the core protein to counteract the antiviral effects of DDX3. We provide evidence that HCV core results in a decrease in the translation of reporter mRNA containing the PACT 5 0 UTR (Fig. 6) . The interaction between HCV core and DDX3 appears to play an important role in attenuating antiviral immune responses. The redistribution Fig. 7 . A model of DDX3-mediated translational control of PACT in antiviral innate immune response to HCV infection. The HCV genomic RNA (ssRNA) contains specific PAMPs, which can be detected by RIG-I to trigger antiviral innate immunity (IFN-b induction) . The dsRNA binding protein PACT is a binding partner of RIG-I and functions as an activator of RIG-I in the sensing of HCV RNAs. Interestingly, the HCV core protein abrogates the RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response by direct binding of DDX3. Inactivation of DDX3 down-regulates the expression of PACT and thus attenuates the viral RNA detection sensitivity of the cells.",

In addition to HCV core, vaccinia virus protein K7 [31] and hepatitis B virus polymerase [40] proteins also abrogate IFN induction by targeting DDX3. It is likely that these viruses have developed a common strategy for evading or suppressing the host's antiviral innate immunity. Notably, PACT also serves as a target of a variety of viruses. It has been reported that viral proteins, including the influenza A virus NS1 protein [44] , the Ebola virus VP35 protein [43, 46] , the herpes simplex virus US11 protein [45] and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus 4a protein [47] , can abrogate RIG-I-mediated IFN induction by direct interaction with the PACT.

Activated PKR is able to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2a, thereby inhibiting translation initiation of cellular and viral mRNAs. PACT-mediated activation of PKR plays a key role in host defense against viral infections. It is obvious that DDX3 can modulate PKR activity through translational control of PACT. Moreover, PACT also functions as a binding partner of Dicer in RNA interference (RNAi) [54] , which is a gene silencing process triggered by dsRNAs [55, 56] . RNAi also plays an antiviral role in infected plants [57] , invertebrates [58] and mammals [59] . Dicer requires PACT to facilitate substrate specificity during small interfering RNA and microRNA biogenesis. The loss of PACT strongly reduces the accumulation of mature microRNA [60] .

To generate a construct expressing HCV core-GFP fusion protein, the HCV core DNA fragment was subcloned from pFS-HCVc174 [51] into NheI and XhoI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). All constructs were confirmed by direct sequencing.",

Cells were harvested for analysis at 3 days posttransduction. Cytoplasmic extracts were loaded on a linear 15-40% sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. After centrifugation, the polysome profile was plotted by A 254 values (top). Total RNA was extracted from each fraction for analysis. The purified RNA was resolved on a 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel, and rRNAs were visualized by ethidium bromide staining (bottom). The levels of mRNA were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR using specific primers for PACT, cyclin E1 and b-actin mRNAs (middle). (B) Translational efficiency of b-actin, PACT and cyclin E1 mRNAs in mock-treated (pLKO.1) and DDX3-knockdown (shDDX3-1 and shDDX3-2) HeLa cells was calculated and shown as a percentage. The bar graph shows the changes of translational efficiency as the mean AE SEM of at least three independent experiments (ns, not significant; ***P < 0.001, *P < 0.05).(Fig. 4B). The above data suggest that DDX3 participates in translational control of PACT mRNA, at least in part, via the structured PACT 5 0 UTR.PACT can partially rescue the antiviral innate immune defects caused by DDX3 knockdownBecause PACT functions in antiviral innate immunity, DDX3-depleted cells may have compromised antiviral capacity. We therefore addressed the effects of DDX3 knockdown on the type I IFN and inflammatory chemokine induction. To mimic viral infection, we first stimulated HEK293 cells with the synthetic analog of dsRNA poly(I:C), as well as the HCV PAMP RNA, a polyU/UC sequence in the 3 0 region of the HCV genome. Transfected poly(I:C) and the HCV PAMP RNA function as ligands for cytoplasmic RLRs to induce antiviral innate immune response[36]. As expected, poly(I:C) induced IFN-b1 and CCL5/RANTES expression in a dose-dependent manner, and this was impaired in DDX3-knockdown HEK293 cells(Fig. 5A, lanes 1-6). Similar results were obtained by transfection with the HCV PAMP RNA into HEK293 cells to induce IFN-b1 and CCL5/RANTES expression(Fig. 5A, lanes 7-8).",
