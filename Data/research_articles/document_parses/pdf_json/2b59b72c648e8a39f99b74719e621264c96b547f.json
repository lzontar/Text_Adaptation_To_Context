The clearance of senescent cells is expected to decrease chronic, low-grade inflammation and improve tissue repair capacity, thus attenuating the decline of physical function in aged organisms. However, selective and effective clearance of senescent cells of different cell types has proven challenging. Herein, we developed a prodrug strategy to design a new compound based on the increased activity of lysosomal \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal), a primary characteristic of senescent cells. Our prodrug SSK1 is specifically activated by \u03b2-gal and eliminates mouse and human senescent cells independently of senescence inducers and cell types. In aged mice, our compound effectively cleared senescent cells in different tissues, decreased the senescence-and age-associated gene signatures, attenuated low-grade local and systemic inflammation, and restored physical function. Our results demonstrate that lysosomal \u03b2-gal can be effectively leveraged to selectively eliminate senescent cells, providing a novel strategy to develop anti-aging interventions.",

[11] [12] [13] Reported senolytics target antiapoptotic pathways, which are up-regulated to inhibit apoptosis in senescent cells. 11, 14 These senolytics have been reported to eliminate certain types of senescent cells and have shown the potential to improve physiological function in several tissues. 7, 12, 15 However, senolytic drugs have significant limitations in killing senescent cells in terms of specificity and broad-spectrum activity because of the dynamic and highly heterogeneous nature of the senescence program, which leads to the varying sensitivity of different types of senescent cells to current senolytic drugs. 6, 16, 17 To overcome these challenges, it is highly demanded to develop a new strategy that permits selectively deleting senescent cells in a wide spectrum of cell types or tissues for anti-aging interventions.",

We chose gemcitabine because (1) it killed both mouse and human senescent cells effectively and potently ( Fig. 1a; Supplementary information, Fig. S1a -c and Table S1); (2) its 4-amino group is a well-established site for prodrug development; 24 and (3) it exhibited reduced systemic toxicity due to its short plasma circulation time. 25, 26 Therefore, we synthesized senescence-specific killing compound 1 (SSK1) (Fig. 1b) , in which the acetyl group and \u03b2-gal-responsive moiety improved the cellular permeability and specificity, respectively. 27 Gemcitabine has been reported to be transported into cells via molecular transporters for nucleosides given its hydrophilicity, 24, 25 however SSK1 was modified with acetyl group and \u03b2-gal-responsive moiety suggesting its hydrophobicity (Fig. 1b) . Nucleoside transporter inhibitor was unable to block the killing effect of SSK1 indicating that SSK1 entered the senescent cells independent of transporter (Supplementary information, Fig. S1e ). We also validated that the prodrug SSK1 was specifically cleaved to release cytotoxic gemcitabine in senescent cells but not in non-senescent cells Fig. 1 Design of SSK1 and validation of its ability to selectively kill senescent cells. a Quantification of cell viability of non-senescent and replication-induced senescent new born dermal fibroblasts (NBFs) incubated with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine for 3 days (n = 3). b Molecular structure of the prodrug SSK1. c Metabolism of SSK1 into gemcitabine in replication-induced senescent NBFs and their nonsenescent counterparts incubated with SSK1 (0.5 \u00b5M) for 3 days (n = 3). d Quantification of cell viability of senescent and non-senescent NBFs incubated with increasing concentrations of SSK1 for 3 days (n = 4). e Cell viability of GLB1 knockdown (shGLB1-1, -2 and -3) or shControl senescent cells treated with vehicle or SSK1 (0.5 \u00b5M) for 3 days (n = 4).

We found that SSK1 selectively and potently eliminated \u03b2-gal-positive senescent cells within a wide therapeutic window ( Fig. 1d ; Supplementary information, Fig. S1f -i). Since SSK1 was cleaved into 4-(hydroxymethyl)-2nitrophenol and gemcitabine in senescent cells, as a control, the hydrolyzed product of SSK1 -4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitrophenol showed no obvious toxicity to senescent and non-senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S1j ), and gemcitabine killed both cells at the similar concentration (Fig. 1a) . To address whether SSK1 cleared senescent cells through \u03b2-gal rather than the higher metabolic rates in senescent cells, we tested another gemcitabinebased prodrug (LY2334737) lacking the galactose moiety and found no obvious difference in the elimination of senescent cells and non-senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S1k ). We further used RNA interference to decrease the expression of GLB1, the gene encoding \u03b2-gal (Supplementary information, Fig. S1l ). 28 Knockdown of GLB1 reduced SA-\u03b2-gal activity (Supplementary information, Fig. S1m ) and showed little effect on other senescence markers, such as p16, p21 and Il1\u03b1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1n ). More importantly, knockdown of GLB1 impaired the ability of SSK1 to kill SA-\u03b2-gal-positive senescent cells (Fig. 1e) , suggesting that its specificity for senescent cells depended on lysosomal \u03b2-gal activity. Collectively, we leveraged lysosomal \u03b2-gal, one conserved characteristic of senescent cells to design a prodrug that specifically killed senescent cells.",

As gemcitabine has been reported to induce cell death through the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 29, 30 we examined the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK and its upstream MKK3/MKK6 in SSK1-treated senescent cells by western blot. 31, 32 After SSK1 treatment, both p38 MAPK and MKK3/MKK6 were activated by phosphorylation in senescent cells ( Fig. 1f; Supplementary information, Fig. S2a, b) , indicating that SSK1 could be processed into gemcitabine in senescent cells and activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. This was further confirmed by the treatment of p38 MAPK inhibitors Birb796, SB203580, and SB202190, which impaired SSK1's ability to specifically kill senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S2c ). Thus, SSK1 killed senescent cells through the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. We also found that SSK1 was able to induce mitochondrial DNA damage in senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S2d ), similar to the reported ganciclovir, which also belongs to the nucleoside analogs as gemcitabine. 33 Additionally, flow cytometry analysis showed that SSK1 induced senescent cells into annexin V and propidium iodide double-positive cells, and western blot result showed SSK1 could activate caspase 3, which indicated that SSK1 killed senescent cells by inducing apoptosis (Fig. 1g ; Supplementary information, Fig. S2b ). These results suggested that our prodrug SSK1 was activated by lysosomal \u03b2-gal and selectively killed senescent cells through the activation of p38 MAPK and induction of apoptosis.",

ABT263 could also specifically kill senescent HEFs induced by different stresses but in a narrow concentration range (Supplementary information, Fig. S3k ). These results demonstrated that SSK1 has higher specificity and potency to eliminate senescent cells. SSK1 decreases senescent cells in lung-injured mice Next, we examined the effect of SSK1 on senescent cells in vivo. We employed two independent in vivo models of senescence: stress-induced senescence and naturally occurring senescence. First, we induced DNA strand break and cellular senescence in mouse lungs by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. 34, 35 SA-\u03b2gal-positive senescent cells were easily induced in these mice with lung injury (Supplementary information, Fig. S4a, b) , a commonly used model to study elimination of senescent cells. [36] [37] [38] We treated these lung-injured mice with vehicle or SSK1 by intraperitoneal injection (Fig. 3a) and found that SSK1 significantly reduced the percentage of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells in lung by 3.8fold compared with that in vehicle-treated lung-injured mice (Fig. 3b) . RT-qPCR results revealed that SSK1 also decreased senescence-associated markers compared with vehicle treatment (Fig. 3c ). In consistent with this result, our RNA-seq results indicated that the expression of senescence-related genes was significantly decreased in lung tissues from SSK1-treated group (Fig. 3d) . We further confirmed that SSK1 reduced p21-positive cells by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3e) . Taken together, our results indicated that SSK1 could eliminate SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells and decrease senescence-associated markers in vivo.",

We then evaluated the change of systemic health parameters following SSK1 treatment. We found that the treatment of SSK1 was beneficial to the body weight recovery in bleomycin-induced lung-injured mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S4e ). Especially, exercise capacity and muscle strength measured by treadmill and grip strength respectively were significantly increased in SSK1-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S4f, g) . Additionally, SSK1 treatment showed a tendency to increase the survival rate (Supplementary information, Fig. S4h ).

We performed immunofluorescence analysis of F4/80-positive macrophages, and found that these cells accumulated in livers of aging mice and that SSK1 could attenuate the macrophage infiltration (Supplementary information, Fig. S6g ). This could partially account for the decreased inflammatory cytokines in aged mice. The decline of macrophage accumulation was further confirmed by our RNA-seq data of livers analyzed by xCell (Supplementary information, Fig. S6h , i). 47 Notably, these results were consistent with our findings in the lung injury model, in which a reduction of \u03b2-gal-positive macrophages was observed in lungs of the SSK1-treatd mice with a decrease of inflammatory factors (Supplementary information, Fig. S6j ). Collectively, these results showed that SSK1 efficiently alleviated SASP both locally and systemically, which were probably due to elimination of accumulated senescent cells and macrophages in aged organisms.",

To this end, we evaluated their physical performance by a series of functional assays which were all declined in aged mice ( Fig. 6a -e). Compared with vehicle treatment, SSK1 treatment for 8 weeks significantly increased the maximal rotarod time (Fig. 6a) , treadmill distance ( Fig. 6b) , grip strength (Fig. 6c) , and rearing exploration time (Fig. 6d ) as well as decreased the balance beam crossing time (Fig. 6e) in Fig. 4 SSK1 deletes senescent cells and attenuates senescence-associated signatures in aged mice. a Experimental design for SSK1 treatment of aged mice.

The foundation of our prodrug strategy was to select a highly specific senescence marker and identify an appropriate potent drug to efficiently kill senescent cells. First, the elevated enzymatic activity of \u03b2-gal, a universal senescence biomarker both in vitro and in vivo, 18, 52 was utilized to direct the prodrug to specifically target senescent cells. Second, through the screening of hundreds of FDA-approved drugs, we found gemcitabine to be one of the most potent agents in killing non-dividing senescent cells ( Fig. 1a; Supplementary information, Fig. S1b , c, and Table S1 ). In addition, gemcitabine is a widely used FDA-approved drug with proven safety and short plasma circulation time. 25, 26 Our designed prodrug SSK1 is activated to release gemcitabine selectively in senescent cells (Fig. 1c) , following which senescent cells were effectively eliminated (Fig. 1d) . Our further study showed that gemcitabine activates p38 to induce apoptosis in non-dividing senescent cell (Supplementary information, Fig. S2a, b) . As a nucleoside analog, gemcitabine could kill senescent cells through inducing mitochondrial DNA damage (Supplementary information, Fig. S2d ), similar to a reported nucleoside analog, Ganciclovir. 33 These results demonstrated that prodrug SSK1 is superior to current reported senolytics in terms of design strategy and specificity.",

Second, SSK1 could decrease the expression of SASP-associated genes in aged livers and kidneys and reduce chronic low-grade inflammation in the blood (Fig. 5a , b, e-h). Third, SSK1 ameliorated the impaired motor function, balance, exhausted exercise, muscle strength, and spontaneous exploration in aged mice (Fig. 6a-e) .

Therefore, eliminating macrophage accumulation by SSK1 might reduce chronic inflammation and benefit aged organisms. In addition, activated macrophages play crucial roles in acute inflammation and cytokine storm, 56 especially those induced by virus infection. During virusinduced acute inflammation, macrophages produce proinflammatory factors and trigger initiation of cytokine storms. 57 For instance, the depletion of macrophages could protect mice from coronavirus-induced lethal infection. 58 Accordingly, activated macrophages could be potential targets for treating acute inflammation and cytokine storms via SSK1. The future potential for SSK1 in treatment of acute inflammation, injury, and ageinduced chronic inflammation is promising.",

            "text": "An understanding of the toxicological effects of SSK1 in vivo is critical to clinical applications. Importantly, our data showed that high concentration (100 mg/kg) and high frequency SSK1 treatment had no apparent systemic toxicities (Supplementary  information, Fig. S9 ). This provides strong evidence for the in vivo safety of SSK1. This safety profile is further supported by comparison to gemcitabine, an SSK1 effector and approved clinical drug. First, our effective in vivo dosage of SSK1 was approximately 60-fold lower than the clinical dosage of gemcitabine (30 mg/kg) and implies a greatly reduced risk of in vivo toxicity of SSK1. 24 Second, gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that potently affects rapidly dividing cells and the off-target effects of gemcitabine could be shown in different proliferating cell types. 59,60 SSK1, however, targets only \u03b2-gal-positive cells. Notably, in addition to macrophages, we found that the majority of nonsenescent \u03b2-gal-positive cells are rapidly dividing epithelial cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S10a, b) . As a result, the potential types of proliferating cells with SSK1 sensitivity are greatly narrowed relative to gemcitabine. Even though small numbers of \u03b2-gal-positive epithelial cells are targeted by SSK1 treatment, these cells have robust self-renewal ability. 61 Consistent with this self-renewal property, we found that epithelial tubular cells in the kidney with elevated \u03b2-gal activity had a high percentage of Ki67positive cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S10c ). Following SSK1 treatment, we observed only a few cells of this tubular cell population undergoing apoptosis (Supplementary information, Fig. S10d ), and such low-level impairment could be easily repaired by the rapid self-renewal of tubular cells during SSK1 treatment. Moreover, the short duration of SSK1 treatment might avoid significant impairment in related tissues and further minimize its side effects. In summary, our study demonstrates the superiority and safety of this prodrug strategy by targeting \u03b2-gal to selectively remove senescent cells of multiple cell types. These findings open a new avenue for the treatment of age-associated diseases and provide a clinical opportunity for intervention into the aging process.",
