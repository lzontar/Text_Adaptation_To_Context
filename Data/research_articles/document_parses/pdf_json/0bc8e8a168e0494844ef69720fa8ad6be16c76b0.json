In response to this serious situation, the World 5 Health Organization (WHO) declares it a public health emergency of international 6 concern on 30th of January and calls for collaborative efforts of all countries to prevent 7 the rapid spread of COVID-19. It is declared as a global pandemic by WHO on 12th of 8 March [4, 5] . 9 The outbreak of coronavirus in Italy is officially confirmed to be on 31th of January, 10 when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus [6] . One week later an 11 Italian man repatriated back to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, is hospitalised and 12 confirmed as the third case in Italy [7] . A cluster of cases is later detected, starting with 13 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy [8] . As of 7th of May 2020, over three million cases of 14 COVID-19 has been reported with a death toll of over 270.000 patients [9] . Among the 15 top ranking countries, Italy is reported to be in the third position, after America and 16 Spain, with over 215.000 confirmed cases and over 26.000 deaths [9] . 17 Health authorities in Italy have made substantial efforts to control the disease 18 through various measures. On 8th of March, Prime Minister of Italy extends the 19 quarantine lockdown to cover the whole region of Lombardy and 14 other northern 20 provinces. On 10th of March, he increases the quarantine lockdown to cover all of Italy, 21 including travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings [10]. Public education is 22 considered as one of the most important measures that could help control the diseases, 23 as has been the case regarding MERS [11] or SARS [12, 13] . In fact, On 4th of March, 24 the government announces the closure of all degree of schools. 25 The main aim of our present study is to investigate the level of knowledge, attitude, 26 and practice of young subjects attending secondary schools toward COVID-19 infection. 27 This study is interesting to detect variables associated with a satisfactory level of them 28 and to explore how knowledge about the disease has affected their lifestyles or health 29 behaviors. For the purpose of this study, a questionnaire self-administered is developed especially 33 for this research in native spoken language (Italian). A small subgroup of twenty male 34 and twenty female students are asked to complete the questionnaire and then to ask 35 some questions on whether the questionnaire is easy to understand, to complete and to 36 submit. Reliability of the questionnaire in its translated form is measured by calculating 37 Cronbach's alpha for each total scale. In our case, a value of Cronbach's alpha > 0.8 is 38 considered significative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 165, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 230, "end": 233, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 255, "end": 256, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 287, "end": 290, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 291, "end": 293, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 345, "end": 346, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 428, "end": 429, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 521, "end": 522, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 607, "end": 608, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 619, "end": 621, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 624, "end": 625, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 780, "end": 783, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 804, "end": 806, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 896, "end": 898, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 936, "end": 939, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 994, "end": 996, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1031, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1087, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1158, "end": 1161, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1176, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1267, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1335, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1340, "text": "17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1424, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1504, "end": 1506, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1589, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1681, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1771, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1859, "end": 1861, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1902, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1915, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1916, "end": 1919, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1950, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2016, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2192, "end": 2194, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "After validation questionnaire, we develop the final version with 19 items, featured 40 in the form of a multiple choice answers.
