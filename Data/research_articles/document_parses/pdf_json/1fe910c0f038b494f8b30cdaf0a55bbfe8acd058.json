The purpose of this article is to share early learnings from the West Coast of the United States, where the first US case was cared for. In this article, I describe the emerging principles allowing us to respond to an unprecedented crisis: prevent, protect, and control. By the time this crisis is over, I do not doubt that we will have additional science and experience to support our frontline nurses and our nurse leaders. That said, I felt it was important to share our expertise in real time for others to benefit from. I would also point out that writing about what you are feeling is cathartic-I encourage my colleagues to join me in writing about what you are experiencing.",

ER nurses are hot stuff. They can handle anything. They thrive in chaos-the rush of the unknown is their source of energy. They are prepared to survive in chaotic, fastpaced situations. No matter the preparation, what we are faced with right now is just insane. Our world has been changed-maybe forever.",

On January 15th, the first US COVID-19 patient landed at the Seattle-Tacoma International airport. According to Johns Hopkins University, 1 as of March 22nd, 2020, since January 15th, 2020, the virus has now spread to at least 33,200 individuals in the United States, killing at least 380. (I know those numbers will have dramatically increased by the time you read this.) By mid-February, I was getting nervous about the possibility that this disease would make its way to Southern California, eating away our precious world as we knew it then. All of the following is representative of where I am in the process on March 22, 2020. I hope the messages are replaced with greater hope and positive outcomes than those presented here.",

No vendors should be allowed in the procedural areas (unless they are required for the procedure), and no students should be allowed either. Access to all isolation rooms should be restricted only to those actually caring for the patients. This restriction means no \"grand rounds\" in the room, no visitors, and again, no students.
