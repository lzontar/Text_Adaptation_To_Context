As an example, during recent years, cases of \"imported\" and \"airport\" malaria have surfaced in Europe, North America, and other regions of the world (Gratz, Steffen, & Cocksedge, 2000 ; World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 1999) . Of the 8,353 cases of imported malaria identified in the U.K. between 1987 and 1992, it was found that immigrants accounted for 11% of the cases, while the remainder were attributable to U.K. nationals who had visited friends and family members in malaria-endemic regions of the world (49% of the cases), visitors and tourists to the U.K. (35%), and expatriates (5%) (WHO, 1999) . The 2002-2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) similarly demonstrated how quickly disease could spread from country to country as a result of the increased international mobility of individuals for a variety of purposes, including tourism, global investment and trade, and permanent migration (Catto, 2003; deLisle, 2004) .",

Under Article 21 of its Constitution, the WHO has the authority to adopt regulations relating to \"sanitary and quarantine requirements and other procedures designed to prevent the international spread of disease\" (WHO Constitution, 1948) . The IHR are intended to \"ensure the maximum security against the international spread of diseases\" while minimizing the impact of these efforts on international traffic and trade. In order to achieve this objective, the IHR provides for the establishment of a global surveillance system for yellow fever, plague, and cholera; requires specified health-related capabilities at ports and airports, such as safe drinking water and a mechanism for the disposal of excrement; and sets forth provisions relating to the enumerated diseases, such as the use of isolation against an individual arriving at an airport who is suspected of carrying cholera. Under these regulations, Member States may prevent the departure of an individual or carrier and may require health certificates relating to these diseases from individuals seeking entry into a State.",

Commentators have noted that because the right to health as embodied in these documents is so broad, it essentially lacks coherent meaning and cannot be adequately monitored (Fidler, 1999) . Consequently, it is difficult to identify the minimum level of responsibility that nations have. Gostin and Lazarrini have argued that \"the state would have a responsibility, within the limits of its available resources, to intervene to prevent or reduce serious threats to the health of individuals or populations\" (1997, p. 29) . This would presumably apply to individuals within the territorial limits of each country, including immigrants. Table 14 .2 enumerates the source of governments' responsibility to protect the public health and the individual rights that may be impinged upon in this process. The government's right to infringe upon individuals' freedom of movement may provide justification for the imposition of quarantine measures and for limitations on the ability to travel. As can be seen, there exists a tension between, on the one hand, the State's sovereignty and its corollary right of self-preservation and duty to protect public health and, on the other hand, the rights of each individual.",

U.S. law provides specifically for the exclusion of all HIV-infected individuals who are not citizens or lawfully permanent residents (\"green card\" holders or \"mica\" holders), absent a waiver of this provision. Waivers, discussed in greater detail below, are potentially available to refugees and several other classes of persons, but are relatively difficult to obtain. This policy is premised both on fears of contagion and fears that HIV-infected immigrants will drain available publicly-funded health care. In a scenario that raised widespread shock and claims of racism, the U.S. government attempted to deny HIV-infected Haitian refugees entry into the U.S. and subjected them to detention in a refugee camp without the provision of adequate medical care and sanitary precautions (Haitian Centers Council v. Sale, 1993) . This move was widely criticized as a violation of international law and/or human rights because the consideration of refugees' HIV seropositivity nullified their ability to exercise their rights to the same degree as other refugees, thereby violating the principle of nondiscrimination. Additionally, it was argued, the per se exclusion of refugees due to health status could not be justified as related to public health or public expense because HIV is not a threat to either in the absence of specific individual behaviors, which were not in evidence (Goodwin-Gill, 1996) .",

Others have countered these arguments by noting that it is the right of every country to decide who may enter (Fidler, 1999; Goodwin-Gill, 1996) and the infringement of the right to privacy arises from the improper use of information relating to an individual's seropositivity, rather than the denial of admission into the country (Fidler, 1999) .",

A relatively recent analysis of international treaty provisions related to health care concluded that these protections afforded to refugees apply to only those who are lawfully resident within the territorial boundaries of a nation and not to those who may have entered illegally (Goodwin-Gill, 1996) . It has been argued that nations' refusal and failure to make these same health services available to refugees and asylum seekers who have entered their borders illegally in search of a refuge constitutes constructive refoulement and a violation of the international principle of nonrefoulement (Cholewinski, 2000) .",

            "text": "Subsequent legal reforms at both the state and federal levels have impacted even further immigrants' ability to obtain medical care due to a lack of health care coverage. As an example of state-level legal changes, the ballot initiative known as Proposition 187 was passed by California voters in 1994. If implemented, this initiative would have barred undocumented individuals from using public benefits, including Medicaid. (Palinkas & Arciniega, 1999; Ziv & Talo, 1995) , and would have required that specified health care providers report their undocumented patients to law enforcement officers. Following the passage of Proposition 187, the California Department of Health Services developed a special program in collaboration with the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to demand that foreign-born noncitizen women returning to the U.S. through California ports of entry and airports repay Medicaid for any benefits they had used. [The INS was disestablished and its functions incorporated into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). For ease of reference, this chapter will continue to refer to the agency as the INS.] The women were advised that failure to repay these sums could result in a denial of their re-entry into the country (California State Auditor, 1999; Wiles, Wright, Parks, & Clayton, 1997) . However, no such requirement for repayment existed under either Medicaid law or immigration law (Schlosberg & Wiley, 1998) . These efforts to garner payments from the women exacerbated fears among even legal immigrants that their legitimate reliance on Medicaid benefits could lead to their characterization by INS as \"public charges\" and result in their exclusion or expulsion from the U.S. (Berk, Schur, Chavez, & Frankel, 2000; Schlosberg & Wiley, 1998; Sun-Hee Park, Sarnoff, Bender, & Korenbrot, 2000) .",

PRWORA created two classes of immigrants for the purpose of determining potential eligibility for specified publicly funded benefits, including nonemergency medical services, such as prenatal care. Immigrants who obtained their legal permanent resident status prior to August 22, 1996, the date of the law's enactment, were to be known as \"qualified aliens.\" Individuals who obtained their legal permanent resident status after the date of enactment were to be classified as \"nonqualified aliens.\" Pursuant to provisions in the legislation, most such individuals would be ineligible to receive publicly funded benefits, including Medicaid-funded services, for a period of five years following their receipt of their legal status.",

Nonqualified aliens would be subject to a deeming requirement, whereby the income of the U.S. citizen or permanent resident individual(s) who sponsored them for immigration would be considered in calculating eligibility for the benefit. In addition to the restrictions that were imposed on the receipt of benefits by certain legally immigrated individuals, the federal legislation provides that states may not provide nonemergency services to nonqualified aliens, including undocumented persons, without first passing new state legislation providing for the use of state funding for this coverage.",

Asch and colleagues reported that the passage of Proposition 187 in California may have discouraged immigrants in Los Angeles County from seeking screening and/or early treatment for TB infection (Asch, Leake, Abderson, & Gelberg, 1998) . The passage of Proposition 187 was also found to be associated with a decrease in new walk-in patients at an ophthalmology clinic at a major public innercity hospital in Los Angeles County (Marx, Thach, Grayson, Lowry, Lopez, & Lee, 1996) and a decrease in patients at an STD clinic (Hu, Donovan, Ford, Courtney, Rulnick, & Richwald, 1995) . However, Loue and colleagues found no statistically significant difference in time between onset of gynecological illness and seeking of care, or length of time between seeking care and receipt of care among women of Mexican ethnicity of varying immigration statuses in San Diego County (Loue, Cooper, & Lloyd, 2005) . Another study of immigrants of various nationalities, languages, and immigration statuses in Cuyahoga County, Ohio similarly found no effect of the reform laws on immigrants' ability to access care (Loue, Faust, & Bunce, 2000) . A high proportion of respondents in this latter study, however, had entered the U.S. as refugees and, as such, were not subject to the restrictions on their receipt of publicly funded health care.",

Additionally, it has been argued, all individuals have moral claims against others to obtain needed assistance. Counterarguments have been voiced, contending that (1) any response to a need for assistance is a matter of charity, rather than duty; (2) citizenship is a prerequisite to a valid moral claim to the state's services; and (3) at least some undocumented immigrants have forfeited any moral claim because they chose to enter into or remain in the U.S. illegally (Nickel, 1986) .",
