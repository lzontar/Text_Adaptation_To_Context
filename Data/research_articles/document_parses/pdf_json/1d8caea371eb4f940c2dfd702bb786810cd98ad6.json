With improvement in diagnostic ability to identify viruses in respiratory secretions (nasopharyngeal aspirates) multiple viral agents have been identified as causative agents of acute bronchiolitis: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza viruses, Influenza virus, Adenovirus, and Coronavirus. RSV is the most common cause, accounting for 50-80% cases [3] . In Indian studies, RSV infection was diagnosed in 30-70% of children with bronchiolitis [4] [5] [6] . The proportion of disease caused by specific viruses varies depending upon the season and the year, and there is a wide variation in the reported proportions among various studies. Most of the studies implicate rhinovirus (which normally causes common cold) as the second most common cause of bronchiolitis. Molecular diagnostic techniques have also revealed a high frequency (15-25%) of mixed viral infections among children evaluated for bronchiolitis [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

In contrast to hMPV, the role of HBoV in causing respiratory illnesses is less clear. This is because HBoV is associated with high coinfection rate (50-60%), and therefore the role that HBoV alone plays in illness can be questioned. Another problem with HBoV is its lack of cultivability and hence lack of appropriate models for pathogenesis [12] .",

Most of the children with bronchiolitis have tachycardia and tachypnea. Pulse oximetry helps us in deciding about the need for supplemental oxygen. The chest may appear hyper-expanded and may be hyperresonant to percussion. Wheezes and fine crackles may be heard throughout the lungs. Severely affected patients have grunting, marked retractions. They may be cyanosed, and may have impaired perfusion. Apnea may occur in those born prematurely and in younger than two months of age (15) .

Airway resistance in terminal airways is reduced with CPAP and also there is decreased air trapping, hyperinflation and work of breathing [37] . A systematic review in 2011 on use of CPAP in acute bronchiolitis concluded that the evidence supporting the use of CPAP to reduce PCO 2 and respiratory distress in bronchiolitis was of low methodological quality, and there was no conclusive evidence that CPAP reduced the need for intubation [36] . However, a recent randomised trial comparing nasal CPAP and oxygen inhalation concluded that CPAP resulted in rapid reduction in work of breathing and improvement in the respiratory distress score at 6 hour. The improvement was proportional to the initial severity, suggesting that, early use of CPAP in severe forms of the disease may be beneficial [38] . CPAP level of 7 cm of water was associated with greatest improvement [39] . Current evidence is inconclusive regarding routine use of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis. More studies with adequate numbers and better quality are required.",

In absence of it, a trial of epinephrine inhalation may be given. Further doses of either medications may be continued only on documentation of improvement.",

In pooled analyses, no significant differences were found in hospital admission rate, length of stay, clinical score after 12 hours, or hospital readmission rate.

            "text": "Apart from ribavarin, no other antiviral is currently approved for use in bronchiolitis. Numerous other drugs are undergoing trials for use against RSV, which is the most common cause of bronchiolitis. The immunosuppressive agent leflunomide has been shown to exert potent antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity against RSV in experimental animal models [66] . Another promising group of drugs currently under investigation are the small molecule fusion inhibitors (TMC353121, CL387626, RFI-641, JNJ-2408068 etc) that inhibit viral fusion by interacting with the RSV F protein (RSV F protein mediates the fusion of viral envelope with host cell membrane) [67, 68] . Fusion inhibitors have also been shown to be effective against hMPV in experimental animals, and some researchers have suggested a possibility for use of these fusion inhibitors for early treatment in an epidemic context. However, more studies are needed to characterize the best delivery mode, dosage, and schedule of administration for these fusion inhibitors [69] .",

A meta-analysis (included three RCTs with total 79 participants) evaluated the effect of exogenous surfactant in infants and children with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation [70] . The duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU stay were significantly lower in the surfactant group compared to the control group. Use of surfactant had favourable effects on oxygenation and CO 2 elimination. No adverse effects and no complications were observed. Current evidence suggests that surfactant therapy may have potential use in acute severe bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation. However, in view of few studies including small numbers of participants, reliable estimates of the effects of surfactant cannot be made. There is a need for larger trials with adequate power and to establish beneficial role of administration of surfactant in infants with severe bronchiolitis.",
