This model is supported by global data and observations, including that gathered phenotypically, biochemically, radiologically, and at autopsy. It evolved from the early observation of hypoxic pulmonary insult occurring without reduction in pulmonary compliance and often in the absence of fever. This is not consistent with ARDS, documented in historical pulmonary septic disease states with cytokine storm complicated by hypoxia. A pulmonary vascular pathology was sought in parallel with a possible disruption of surfactant function. Thrombosis and vasoconstriction were implied, with the former supported by consistent, but not specific radiologic findings of ground glass change. Thrombosis has now been confirmed in late disease and at autopsy [11] . The commonality of an aberrant renin angiotensin system (RAS), was identified in the group at risk of severe disease, rather than the presence of underlying lung disease. The biochemical markers in early disease suggested coagulation, renal, cardiac, and respiratory pathology in evolution. With the identification of ACE2 as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, the role of and distribution of ACE2 in the human body was investigated. The hypothesis evolved, providing an explanation for pathophysiologic commonality in the at-risk group in COVID-19, a mechanism for hypoxic pulmonary pathology and the unexpected degree of lung injury consequent to ventilation as well as vascular, renal and cardiac 7 complications. It also predicts that presentation may be atypical and that long term sequelae related to endothelial, renal, pulmonary and cardiac involvement may occur.",

We propose that the disease driver is relative ACE2 deficiency related to viral destruction of ACE2 expressing tissues, with more severe disease manifesting in a cohort with abnormality in the RAS favouring the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) arm. This is supported by the observed frequency of hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes as co-morbidities in the group with severe and fatal disease [16, 17] . These disease entities have been well studied, with documentation of RAS abnormality characterised by increased ACE and angiotensin II (ATII) levels (Fig. 1) . We hypothesise that in these conditions, there is a greater dependence on ACE2 to 8 abrogate the effects of ATII and increase angiotensin (1-7) (AT (1-7) ). An upregulation of ACE2 expressing cells related to chronic ATII elevation [18] or treatment with ACEinhibitors [19] , may increase the infective potential of SARS-CoV-2 in this group as a consequence of the duality of ACE2 functioning as both a receptor for viral entry to cells and as an enzyme. With infection related cell damage and loss, enzymatic ACE2 activity would be globally compromised. Organ specific loss of ACE2 expressing cells (endothelial, alveolus in lungs, proximal tubule and glomerulus in kidneys, pericytes in heart) is likely to also contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19.",

A recent study noted serum levels of ATII were elevated in COVID-19 patients and correlated with viral load and lung injury [20] . ATII is generated by both ACE and non-ACE pathways, but is the dominant substrate for ACE2, being converted to AT(1-7) [21] , a vasodilator with antiinflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiproliferative, antifibrotic, anti-arrhythmic, and antioxidant activity [12, 22] .

PEEP <10cmH2O with prone posturing and supplemental oxygen should be considered in patients requiring respiratory support in the absence of ARDS. 15 With respect to individuals with only mild or moderate disease, we propose that future treatment study protocols consider prophylactic level anticoagulation in at-risk individuals with a low threshold for escalation to full anticoagulation and vasodilation if disease progression is supported by measures of clinical state (particularly hypoxia), and well documented pathology parameters (including D-dimer, FDPs, CRP, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet levels, TnI, and liver and renal function profiles, including albuminuria and IL-6).",

This observation would support a primary respiratory or GI point of viral infection, with the clinical impact of viral infection focussed initially in the lungs, with ongoing infection and severe disease involving the vascular, renal and cardiac systems. This might suggest that COVID-19 is a multi-organ pathology related to viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 [7-9]. A subgroup of people with severe and critical COVID-19 have demonstrated a profile of deterioration and mortality consistent with overwhelming viral sepsis with cytokine storm and ARDS. This is not a typical profile of COVID-19. This group may be considered for additional immune-targeted disease therapy and may be identified by clinical features including unabating fever, ARDS, cytopenias, and biochemicalmarkers of escalating inflammation, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin, as suggested by data gathered in Wuhan[10].",

Early thrombosis, however, is supported in the context of hypoxiaby D-dimer elevation and ground glass change on CT scans. Fat embolism has a similar radiologic appearance, supporting early thrombosis over hypoxia related vasoconstriction alone. The preservation of lung compliance, early in disease, is not consistent with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), or ARDS contributing to the hypoxic insult. Advancing microvascular thrombosis may be supported again by the observation at autopsy of marked right ventricular dilatation reflecting elevated pulmonary vascular pressure [11]. This occurred in the absence of detectable left ventricular pathology. As disease progresses, more drivers of coagulation are likely to be recruited and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may ensue. Autopsy findings of pulmonary small vessel thrombosis was reported by Fox and colleagues [11]. Tang",
