By identifying and critically synthesizing forty-two recent peer-reviewed studies 24 employing capsid-integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food 25 safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of 26 infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided 27 the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of 28 attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing 29 specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay 30 conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its 31 derivates between 10 and 200 \u00b5M; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 -25\u00baC) for 5 to 32 120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 -800 Watts) exposure for periods 33 ranging from 5 to 20 min.

Besides their operational hazards such as light 229 bulbs exploding due to long running times (a maximum of 5 min is recommended by the 230 manufacturer), both the heat and light emission in the ultraviolet and infrared spectra could 231 potentially harm the sample, thus subverting the purpose of the pretreatment altogether. consumer-grade LED light technology in general and the introduction of dedicated 233 azo dye activation light sources by companies like GenIUL, Spain, allowed for a much more 234 precise and reproducible activation of PMA, EMA, PEMAX and PMAxx. Not surprisingly, 72% 235 of the records included in this review utilized either the commercial LED Active Blue light system 236 (GenIUL, Spain) or LEDs emitting blue (around 460 nm) light (Lee et al. (2015); Fongaro et al. 237 (2016)) as depicted in Table 1. A similar trend towards uniformity in the protocol design is 238 apparent in the length of time a sample is exposed to the light source. While the operational 239 requirements of the 500-to 800-W halogen lamps severely limited the exposure time to very short 240 periods (2-5 minutes according to manufacturer's recommendations to avoid excessive heat 241 development that could lead to the light bulb exploding), the standard configuration of the 242 commercial light systems allows for 15 min of intense blue light. Two thirds of the studies 243 therefore employed 15 min as the light exposure time. 244 245 8. Additional reagents for azo dye pretreatment 246 Addition of non-ionic surfactants like Triton X-100 (Coudray-Meunier et al., 2013; Moreno et al., 247 2015) and sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (Lee et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2018) have been described as 248 beneficial for the determination of virus infectivity and were most frequently used in the studies 249 evaluated (Table 1). Inclusion of non-ionic surfactant enable the azo dye molecules to enter 250 partially or completely ruptured capsids, thus improving their binding properties in the virus 251 genome. Palladium and platinum compounds such as Platinum(IV) chloride (PtCl4) and Cis-252 dichlorodiammineplatinum (CPPD) are long known to chelate in mammalian cells by nucleic acid 253 ligands (Rosenberg et al., 1965), and have recently been adopted for the qPCR based 254 discrimination between live and dead bacteria such as E. coli and Cronobacter skazakii (Soejima 255 .", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF15": {"text": "to inactivate viruses were used in the studies included in this review.

Addition of chlorine, exposure to 265 heat, and proteolysis are known to damage the viral capsid, thus rendering the genome accessible 266 to azo dyes. Temperatures from moderate to high (45\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C) for ten to thirty minutes could 267 reproducibly demonstrate the ability of all dyes to remove virus signals (to varying degrees) from 268 molecular quantification (Fraisse et al., 2018; Jeong et al., 2017; Leifels et al., 2015; Leifels et al., 269 2019; Oristo et al., 2018). Similar effects could be shown for the addition of hypochlorite of up to 270 two milligram per milliliter (Fuster et al., 2016; McLellan et al., 2016; Prevost et al., 2016). Light 271 in the ultraviolet spectrum, on the other hand, affects the hydrogen bonds between nucleic acids, 272 resulting in the inability to reproduce inside the host cell. Capsid integrity qPCR failed to capture 273 the loss of virus infectivity in most UV studies (Karim et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2017; Leifels et al., 274 2016; Leifels et al., 2019); it could detect capsid damage caused by medium-pressure UV lamps, 275 especially at 230-245 nm wavelength (Sangsanont et al., 2014), but not nucleic acid damage caused 276 by other wavelengths in the UV range (Beck et al., 2018; Beck et al., 2014; Sirikanchana et al., 277 2008a, b).
