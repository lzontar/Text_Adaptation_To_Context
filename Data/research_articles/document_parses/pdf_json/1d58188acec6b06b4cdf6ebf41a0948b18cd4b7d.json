Empirical study is urgently needed to reliably assess the causal effects of mobility restriction. Methods Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time, after adjusting for confounders. Results The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After four weeks, population mobility declined by 54.81% (interquartile ranges, -65.50% to -43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout six weeks (i.e., 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% (95%CI 0.50% to 0.93%) reduce of cumulative cases for one week, 1.42% two weeks, 1.69% three weeks, 1.72% four weeks,1.64% five weeks and 1.52% six weeks). The impact on weekly new cases seemed greater in the first four weeks, but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. Conclusion Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. However, a change in the degree of mobility restriction may be warranted over time, particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction.

One aimed at controlling sources of infection, including treatment and isolation of confirmed cases, quarantine of exposed persons, or screening of suspicious persons who traveled from Wuhan. 3 The other was the implementation of human mobility restriction, aiming to address asymptomatic transmission or transmission before symptom onset, 4, 5 and the strategies included suspending intra-city public transport, prohibiting inter-city travels, closing entertainment venues, or banning public gatherings. 2 Among 342 Chinese cities, 40% suspended intra-city public transport and 64% closed entertainment venues. 3 The COVID-19 epidemic in China was under control three months after the outbreak. 6, 7 COVID-19 continues to spread across the world. 8 In the context of resource-limited setting (e.g., lack of virus detection kits), implementing a universal coverage to detect COVID-19 cases is unlikely. The necessary personal protective measures (e.g. face masking) are still in short. As a result, human mobility restriction has been widely used to contain COVID-19 in most countries. 9-11 However, this strategy has raised extensive criticisms. 12, 13 Emerging studies investigated its effects on containing COVID-19. 3 ,11,14-16 including spatial-temporal relation between mobility restriction and diseases transmission 14, 15, 17 and initial investigation about the impact of mobility restriction at the early stage. For instance, one study found that suspending intra-city public transport or closing entertainment venues was associated with number of cases reported during the first week of outbreaks; 3 the other suggested that travel restriction was effective at the early stage of outbreak, but may be less useful when the disease is widespread. 18 However, distinct knowledge gaps exist about the impacts of human mobility restriction on the disease spread. In particular, the real-world effects of mobility restriction policy remain less clear, as the policy implementation may differ across regions and over time. One plausible argument is that the effects of human mobility restriction may fade over time, and a decision on the level and length of mobility restriction represents a core question for policy makers, whereby disease control and economic growth have to be balanced. All these are linked to casual inferences of the effects of human mobility restrictions and thorough assessments on the magnitude of the effects by time and baseline risks. Thus, we conducted a study to bridge this important gap.

First of all, we believe that the implementation of population mobility restrictions is appropriate and strongly needed, in balancing the serious pandemic and the fatal consequences it has caused versus the economic loss and temporary loss of personal mobility. Up to March 11, 2020, a total of 30 documents were issued from national governmental authority (Table S3 ). These policy documents covered nearly all social activities across cities and rural areas, including healthcare services, education, transportation, tourism, elderly care, child welfare service, employment, work at home, and community management. Accordingly, the continual policies implementation resulted in the promptly mobility declines, and further lead to effective and rapid reduction of new cases in subsequent weeks, which would, in turn, rapidly eliminate the impact of the pandemic. Secondly, we may also infer from our findings that the effects of the mobility restriction policies would be large in the first few weeks, but attenuate over time. After five weeks, their effects became smaller. This alerts that persistent mobility restrictions are highly deserved, but flexible mobility restriction policies may be warranted particularly after several weeks of rigorous mobility restriction. Thirdly, our study suggested larger effects among bigger cities over time, which highlighted that the implementation of mobility restrictions in major metropolises is particularly important and meaningful. Fourthly, the findings strongly advised that, in resource-limited setting where healthcare resources are not readily available, non-medical interventions may be optimal strategies in containing the disease transmission. We also believe that these strategies are not just effective in the early stage of the disease outbreak, but also at the stage of wide spread, because of its sheer mechanism to block population contacts at emergencies.
