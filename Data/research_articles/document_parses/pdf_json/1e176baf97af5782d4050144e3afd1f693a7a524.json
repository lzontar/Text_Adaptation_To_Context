When the tested subjects consists of a pool with different infection dates, Equation 30A cannot be used to compute the tested positive for the test in aggregate. Instead, each \"vintage\" of infection must be used to individually calculate the tested positive for that vintage, with the total of tested positive for each vintage then summed up to get the total tested positive for the survey. Additionally, the false positives must be included for the cohort of the test that has never been infected.
