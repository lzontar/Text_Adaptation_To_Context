            "text": "Interestingly, a quite different phenotype was described for the corresponding ExoN-122 knockout mutants of two betacoronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and CoV. While ExoN inactivation decreased replication fidelity in these viruses, conferring 124 a 'mutator phenotype', the mutants were viable, both in cell culture (22, 23) and in 125 animal models (24). These findings suggested that ExoN may indeed be part of an 126 error correction mechanism. Subsequently, the ability of ExoN to excise 3'-terminal 127 mismatched nucleotides from a double-stranded (ds) RNA substrate was 128 demonstrated in vitro using recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 (25). Furthermore, this 129 activity was shown to be strongly enhanced (up to 35-fold) by the presence of nsp10, 130 a small upstream subunit of the CoV replicase (26). The two subunits were proposed 131 to operate, together with the nsp12-RdRp, in repairing mismatches that may be 132 introduced during CoV RNA synthesis (21, 27) . In cell culture, MHV and SARS-CoV 133 mutants lacking ExoN activity exhibit increased sensitivity to mutagenic agents like 5-134 fluoracil (5-FU), compounds to which the wild-type virus is relatively resistant (28, 29) . 135 Recently, ExoN activity was also implicated in CoV RNA recombination, as an MHV 136 ExoN knockout mutant exhibited altered recombination patterns, possibly reflecting its 137 involvement in other activities than error correction during CoV replication and 138 subgenomic mRNA synthesis (30). Outside the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the 139 only other RNA viruses known to employ an ExoN domain, which is part of the 140 arenavirus nucleoprotein and has been implicated in fidelity control (31) and/or immune 141 evasion, the latter by degrading viral dsRNA (32, 33) . Based on results obtained with 142 TGEV and MHV ExoN knockout mutants, also the CoV ExoN activity was suggested 143 to counteract innate responses (34, 35) . 144 In the meantime, CoV nsp14 was proven to be a bifunctional protein by the discovery 145 of an (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity in its C-terminal domain 146 (36) (Fig. 1 ). This enzymatic activity was further corroborated in vitro, using biochemical 147 assays with purified recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14. The enzyme was found capable 148 of methylating cap analogues or GTP substrates, in the presence of S-adenosyl 149 methionine (SAM) as methyl donor (36, 37) . The N7-MTase was postulated to be a 150 key factor for equipping CoV mRNAs with a functional 5'-terminal cap structure, as N7-151 methylation is essential for cap recognition by the cellular translation machinery (25). 152 Although, the characterization of the nsp14 N7-MTase active site and reaction 153 mechanism was not completed, alanine scanning mutagenesis and in vitro assays with 154 nsp14 highlighted several key residues ( Fig. 1) (36, 38, 39) . Moreover, crystal 155 structures of SARS-CoV nsp14 in complex with its nsp10 co-factor (PDB entries 5C8U 156 and 5NFY) revealed several unique structural and functional features (Ma et al., 2015;  157 Ferron et al., 2018) . These combined structural and biochemical studies confirmed that 158 the two enzymatic domains of nsp14 are functionally distinct (36) and physically 159 independent (20, 21). Still, the two activities are structurally intertwined, as it seems 160 that the N7-MTase activity depends on the integrity of the N-terminal ExoN domain, 161 whereas the flexibility of the protein is modulated by a hinge region connecting the two 162 domains (21). 163 Coronaviruses are abundantly present in mammalian reservoir species, including 164 bats, and pose a continuous zoonotic threat (40) (41) (42) (43) . To date, seven CoVs that can 165 infect humans have been identified, and among these the severe acute respiratory continues to circulate and cause serious human disease, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula (45) . Occasional spread to other countries has also occurred, including an 172 outbreak with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea in 2015 (46-48 viable, while displaying a 15-to 20-fold increased mutation rate (Eckerle, Lu et al. 2007 , 203 Eckerle, Becker et al. 2010 ). An alignment of CoV nsp14 amino acid sequences is 204 presented in Fig. 1 , including SARS-CoV-2, which emerged during the course of this 205 project. It highlights the key motifs/residues of the two enzymatic domains of nsp14, 206 as well as other structural elements, like the nsp10 binding site, the hinge region 207 connecting the ExoN and N7-MTase domains, and three previously identified zinc 208 finger domains (20, 21) . The alignment also illustrates the generally high degree of 209 nsp14 sequence conservation across different CoV (sub)genera.",

Still, 292 the E191D mutant was found to be somewhat crippled, yielding smaller plaque sizes 293 and somewhat lower progeny titers in HuH7 cells (Fig. 4 B-C), but not in Vero cells 294 (Fig. 4A ). 295 We next examined the sensitivity of E191D and wt virus to the mutagenic agent 5-296 FU, which intracellularly is converted into a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated 297 into viral RNA (61, 62). Previously, MHV and SARS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants were 298 found to exhibit increased sensitivity to 5-FU treatment, in particular in multi-cycle 299 experiments, which was attributed to a higher mutation frequency in the absence of 300 ExoN-driven error correction (28). We employed this same assay to assess the 301 phenotype of the E191D mutant in more detail, by performing plaque assays in HuH7 Previously, the ExoN activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 was found to be dramatically 366 stimulated by the addition of nsp10 as co-factor (26). Consequently, we also expressed 367 and purified MERS-CoV nsp10 and optimized the ExoN assay by testing different 368 molar ratios between nsp14 and nsp10 (Fig. 6A , left-hand side), different nsp14 369 concentrations (Fig. 6B , left-hand side), and by different incubation times (Fig. 7 , left-370 hand side). MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN activity was found to be stimulated by nsp10 in a 371 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A) , while nsp10 did not exhibit any nuclease activity by 372 itself (Fig. 6B, nsp10 lane) . The full-length substrate is more completely degraded 373 when a fourfold (or higher) excess of nsp10 over nsp14 was used compared to the 374 effect of merely increasing the nsp14 concentration in the assay (Fig. 6B ).

(Fig. 2) . 434 We also evaluated the impact of the H229C ZF1 mutation, which -despite its 435 conservative nature -yielded a crippled mutant virus (Fig. 2) and of two N7-MTase 436 mutations (discussed below). The N7-MTase mutants displayed wt nsp14-like ExoN 437 activities (Fig. 9) , suggesting that -as in SARS-CoV nsp14 -ExoN and N7-MTase 438 activities are functionally separated (36). Analyzing the substrate degradation pattern 439 of the H229C mutant (Fig. 7) , the enzyme seems to be somewhat crippled when 440 compared to wt nsp14. This suggests that this mutation alters ExoN activity in vitro, 441 potentially by affecting the structure of the ExoN domain, as ZF1 is in close proximity of the nsp10 interaction surface (20). However, a similar reduction of ExoN activity was 443 observed for the E191D mutant (Fig. 7) , which was much more viable than the H229C Recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 was found to methylate GpppA, but not m7GpppA 464 (Fig. 10A) , which yielded a signal that was similar to the background signal in assays 465 lacking nsp14 or substrate (data not shown). Methylation increased with time until 466 reaching a plateau after 120 min (Fig. 10B) .

While the R310A and D331A control mutations fully inactivated the N7- ExoN catalytic residues abolished all detectable viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 3 ) and the 484 release of viral progeny (Fig. 2) . The only exception was the conservative E191D 485 mutant, which was found to exhibit near-wild-type levels of ExoN activity ( Fig. 7 and   486 9). Based on nsp14 conservation (Fig. 1 ) and the viable phenotype of SARS-CoV and 487 MHV ExoN-knockout mutants, MERS-CoV was expected to tolerate ExoN inactivation, 488 in particular since the enzyme was proposed to improve the fidelity of CoV replication 489 without being essential for RNA synthesis per se (10, 14, 21-23, 26, 29) .

The phenotype of the E191D 547 virus mutant was comparable to that of wt virus (Fig. 4) . Biochemical assays revealed 548 that E191D-ExoN enzyme is able to hydrolyze a dsRNA substrate with an activity level 549 approaching that of the wt protein (Fig. 9) . Additionally, the E191D mutant behaved In this study, we developed an in vitro assay to evaluate MERS-CoV ExoN activity 554 using a largely double-stranded RNA substrate ( Fig. 6 and 7) .

As nsp14 and nsp16 share a common interaction 567 surface on nsp10 (21, 26, 66), we explored whether a similar co-factor exchange was 568 possible in the context of nsp14's ExoN activity, which was indeed found to be the case 569 (Fig. 8) . Structurally, nsp14 interacts with nsp10 figuratively similar to a \"hand (nsp14) 570 over fist (nsp10)\" conformation (21). In the formation of this complex, nsp10 induces 571 conformational changes in the N-terminal region of ExoN that adjusts the distance 572 between the catalytic residues in the back of the nsp14 palm and, consequently, impact 573 ExoN activity (21).

In previous ZF1 studies, a 591 mutation equivalent to H229A created solubility issues during expression of recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 (20) and resulted in a partially active ExoN in the case 593 of white bream virus, a torovirus that also belongs to the nidovirus order (79). It was 594 suggested that ZF1 contributes to the structural stability of ExoN, as it is close to the 595 surface that interacts with nsp10 (20). Here, we demonstrate that the more 596 conservative H229C replacement, which converts ZF1 from a non-classical CCCH 597 type ZF motif into a classical CCCC type (63), was tolerated during recombinant protein 598 expression and yielded an ExoN that is quite active in vitro (Fig. 7) . This likely 599 contributed to the fact that the H229C virus mutant retained a low level of viability ( Fig.   600 2), although its overall crippled phenotype and the non-viable phenotype of mutant 601 C201H clearly highlight the general importance of ZF1 for virus replication. In contrast, 602 the corresponding TGEV mutant (ZF-C) was not strongly affected and could be stably ",

In this analysis,250 a non-viable MERS-CoV mutant with an in-frame 100-aa deletion in the nsp12-RdRp 251 domain was used as a negative control (NC) for viral RNA synthesis, in order to assess 252 and correct for the detection of any residual full-length RNA transcript that might still 253 be present at this timepoint after transfection.

These 316 experiments demonstrated thatE191D and wt MERS-CoV are comparably sensitive to 317 5-FU treatment, suggesting that ExoN functionality is not strongly affected zinc finger motifs are important for viral replication 321 Studies addressing the structural biology and biochemistry of SARS-CoV nsp14 322 indicated that the two ZF motifs within the ExoN domain contribute to either its 323 structural stability (ZF1) or to catalytic activity (ZF2) (20, 21). Moreover, mutagenesis 324 studies of the MHV and TGEV ZF1 domain supported their importance for viral 325 replication in cell culture (34, 54). To study the impact of similar mutations on MERS-326 CoV replication, the nsp14 ZF1 and ZF2 domains were targeted with two mutations 327 each and their impact on virus viability was evaluated as described above. Two ZF1 328 residues (C210 and H229) were mutated from H to C or vice versa, which could 329 theoretically preserve the zinc-coordinating properties (63, 64). Two residues of the 330 non-classical ZF2 motif were also substituted (C261A and H264R) to evaluate the 331 same ZF mutations previously analyzed by Ma et al., leading to disruption of ExoN 332 activity in vitro (20).333The four ZF virus mutants were launched as described above, after which a low 334 level of replication could be observed only for the H229C ZF1 mutant, for which the 2 335 d p.t. harvest yielded very small plaques and low progeny titers(Fig. 2B). For this 336 mutant, RNA synthesis could not be detected by hybridization analysis(Fig. 3), but337 synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNA (mRNA3) was detected by RT-PCR in 338 intracellular RNA samples harvested at 2 d p.t. (data not shown). A 6 d p.t. harvest 339 was used for full genome sequencing by NGS, which confirmed the presence of the 340 engineered nsp14 mutation in addition to the appearance of some minor genetic 341 variants (point mutations representing less than 15% of the total population) in different regions of the genome, including the ORF1a domain encoding for nsp3, nsp6, nsp8, 343 and nsp9. Taken together, our observations defined the severely crippled phenotype 344 of the H229C mutant. In combination with the fact that the other ZF mutations (C210H 345 in ZF1, and C261A and H264R in ZF2) abolished all detectable MERS-CoV replication, 346 our study establishes the importance of both ExoN ZF motifs for MERS-CoV viability. 347 348 Development of a MERS-CoV ExoN activity assay using recombinant nsp14 349 In order to assess the impact of mutations on nsp14's enzymatic activities, we set out 350 to purify recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and develop an in vitro ExoN assay. Thus far, 351 such an assay had only been described for the equivalent SARS-CoV protein (19, 20, 352 26, 65). Wild-type and mutant MERS-CoV nsp14 proteins carrying an N-terminal His-353 tag were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS. Proteins were purified by 354 immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size exclusion 355 chromatography. Upon SDS-PAGE, the purified MERS-CoV nsp14 was consistently 356 detected as a doublet (with the lower band being most abundant), migrating at the 357 expected molecular mass of ~55 kDa (Fig. 5). As a positive control, we purified SARS-358 CoV nsp14 (26) and used it during optimization of the enzymatic assays for MERS-359 CoV nsp14. The substrate used for ExoN activity assays was a 5'-32 P-labeled 22-360 nucleotide (nt) long synthetic RNA, as previously used in similar assays with SARS-361 CoV nsp14 (referred to as oligonucleotide H4 in (26)). Nucleotides 5-22 of this 362 substrate are predicted to form a hairpin with a stem consisting of seven G-C base 363 pairs and a loop of 4 A's (26), while the remaining 4 nucleotides form a 5'-terminal 364 single-stranded tail.",

Contrary to these expectations, an immediate and complete block of RNA 494 synthesis was observed when MERS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants were launched by 495 transfection of full-length RNA transcripts. It is noteworthy that similar observations 496 were previously made for the corresponding ExoN knockout mutants of the alpha-497 CoVs HCoV-229E (19) and TGEV (34), the gamma-CoV avian infectious bronchitis 498 virus (IBV) (E. Bickerton, S. Keep, and P. Britton, personal communication), and -499according to a recent report that awaits peer review -also for SARS-CoV-2 (30), a 500 close relative of SARS-CoV.501None of the ExoN mutations tested had a negative effect on the in vitro activity of 502 the N7-MTase domain of nsp14, which is deemed essential for viral mRNA capping 503(Fig. 10). This is consistent with previous observations for SARS-CoV nsp14, in which 504 the ExoN and N7-MTase activities were shown to be functionally distinct, though 505 structurally interconnected by a hinge region that confers flexibility (21, 36). Given their 506 unchanged N7-MTase activity, the non-viable phenotype of MERS-CoV ExoN active 507 site mutants must be attributed to a negative effect on an additional and apparently 508 critical function of the ExoN domain, which is directly involved in primary RNA synthesis 509 rather than in (longer-term) fidelity control. At present we cannot explain, why SARS-510 CoV and MHV ExoN knockouts can apparently tolerate ExoN active site substitutions 511 that are lethal to five other CoVs (now including MERS-CoV). Within the 512 betacoronavirus group, in our experience, SARS-CoV and MHV display the most 513 robust RNA synthesis and replication in cell culture when compared to MERS-CoV and 514 SARS-CoV-2 (68-70). Possibly, the recovery of viable progeny depends on reaching 515 a minimum level of RNA synthesis, which may somehow be achieved by only the most 516 efficiently replicating CoVs. Admittedly, even bearing this possibility in mind, it remains 517 difficult to reconcile the 1-to 2-log reduction of progeny titers observed for MHV and 518 SARS-CoV ExoN-knockout mutants with the complete loss of infectious progeny 519 observed for the ExoN-knockout mutants of the other CoVs. 520 In order to eliminate technicalities that might somehow prohibit the successful 521 recovery of MERS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants and explain the phenotypic 522 differences with other CoVs, we explored various details in the transfection protocol. 523 This included the use of a DNA-launched system, similar to that used for TGEV (34), 524 and the propagation of progeny virus in both innate immune-competent 525 and -incompetent cells (Huh7 and Vero cells, respectively). However, this did not 526 change the negative outcome of our transfection experiments, which were repeated 527 more than 10 times for several mutants, always using wt and E191D MERS-CoV as 528 positive controls that proved to be consistently viable. Our extensive set of MERS-CoV 529 ExoN mutants tested, and the results obtained with various other CoVs (see above), 530 strengthen our conclusion that -in addition to its proposed role as a proofreading 531 enzyme -ExoN must have another function in CoV RNA synthesis (57). 532 As reported for MHV and SARS-CoV ExoN mutants (23, 71), possible (late) 533 reversion was observed for a few of our MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants, 534 specifically mutants E191A, D273E, and in particular D90E, which had reverted at 6 d 535 p.t. in three out of six experiments. This suggests that these mutants exhibit a low 536 residual level of RNA synthesis that is the basis for these low-frequency events. In 537 follow-up studies with the crippled H229C ZF1 mutant, a possible pseudo-revertant 538 carrying a second-site mutation (Q19R) in nsp8 was identified in three independently 539 obtained progeny samples, providing genetic support for an interaction between nsp8 540and nsp14, which may be relevant in the context of the association of nsp14 with the 541 tripartite RdRp complex consisting of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12(21, 27,(72)(73)(74).

For TGEV, this suggestion was based on the reduced accumulation 611 of dsRNA by the ZF-C mutant, which however remains to be characterized in more 612 detail. In the absence of a TGEV ExoN activity assay, and in view of our data for the 613 equivalent MERS-CoV ZF1 mutant, it seems premature to assume that the reduced 614 levels of dsRNA in infected cells are caused by increased exonuclease activity of the 615 ZF-C ExoN mutant (34).616In general, the properties of viable CoV ExoN mutants warrant further analysis. In 617 future studies, the repertoire of residues probed by site-directed mutagenesis should 618 be extended beyond active site and ZF motifs, which may help in particular to establish 619 how directly reduced ExoN activity, primary viral RNA synthesis and enhanced innate 620 responses are connected. Regardless of its possible interactions with host cell 621 pathways, nsp14 clearly is a key subunit of the multi-enzyme complex that drives CoV 622 genome replication, subgenomic RNA synthesis, and RNA recombination.623 Understanding the structure-function interplay between ExoN and other (viral and/or 624 host) components will be key to elucidating its role in CoV RNA synthesis and evolution 625 (83, 84).

For transfections, cells were maintained in 638 Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza) with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS; 639 Bodinco) supplemented with 100 IU/ml of penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml of streptomycin Sigmathe MERS-CoV nsp14-coding region were engineered in a bacterial 645 artificial chromosome (BAC) vector (51, 52) containing the full-length cDNA copy of 646 MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 (44, 53), by two-step en passant recombineering in E. 647 coli (86). When designing the primers, a translationally silent marker mutation was 648 introduced near the site of mutagenesis in order to differentiate between the 649 occurrence of reversion and (possible) contamination with parental virus.

Cells 663 were incubated at 37\u2070C up to a maximum of 6 days post transfection (d.p.t.). 664 Supernatants were collected when full cytopathic effect was observed or at the end of the experiment.

After hybridization, 688 RNA bands were visualised (using exposure times of up to 28 days) and quantified by phosphorimaging using a Typhoon-9410 variable mode scanner (GE Healthcare) and 690 ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). 691 PCR primers and Taqman probes targeting ORF1a (junction of nsp2-nsp3 coding 692 region), the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene, or the leader-body TRS junction of 693 subgenomic mRNA3 were designed and analyzed for multiplex quality using Beacon 694 Designer TM Software (Premier Biosoft). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed 695 using RevertedAid H minus reverse transcriptase (ThermoFischer Scientific) and a mix 696 of specific reverse primers targeting ORF1a, ORF8, or subgenomic RNA 3 (primer 697 sequences used available upon request).

The drug was then removed and cells 717 were infected at an MOI of 0.1 during 1 h at 37\u2070C.

            "text": "). Like SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV2 and MHV, MERS-CoV is classified as a member of the 174 betacoronavirus genus, although it belongs to a different lineage (subgenus) of that cluster (49, 50). The current lack of approved therapeutics and vaccines to prevent or treat CoV infections, as well as the general threat posed by emerging CoVs, necessitates the further in-depth characterization of CoV replication and replicative 178 enzymes. In this context, the quite different phenotypes described for ExoN knockout mutants of other CoVs (see above) prompted us to study the importance of this enzyme 180 for MERS-CoV replication. To this end, using both reverse genetics and biochemical 181 assays with recombinant nsp14, we engaged in an extensive site-directed 182 mutagenesis study, targeting all active site residues of the MERS-CoV ExoN domain. Strikingly, in contrast to what was observed for other betacoronaviruses, our studies 184 revealed that ExoN inactivation renders MERS-CoV RNA synthesis undetectable and results in failure to recover viable virus progeny. Our biochemical evaluation of nsp14 mutants suggests that this is not caused by inadvertent side-effects of ExoN inactivation on N7-MTase activity. Our combined data suggest that MERS-CoV ExoN 188and/or nsp14 play a more direct and fundamental role in CoV RNA synthesis than merely safeguarding the long-term fidelity of replication, and can be considered a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs.ExoN inactivation is lethal for MERS-CoVPrevious studies into CoV ExoN function involved its biochemical characterization 196 (based almost exclusively on the SARS-CoV version of the enzyme) and the phenotypic analysis of (predicted) ExoN knockout virus mutants, generated using 198 reverse genetics approaches. The latter studies yielded replication-incompetent ExoN knockout mutants for the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E (19) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (34). However, the equivalent mutants of the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MHV-A59 were somewhat crippled but clearly",
