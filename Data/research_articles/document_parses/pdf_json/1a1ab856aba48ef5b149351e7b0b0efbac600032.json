Apart from overall obesity, body fat distribution is an important risk factor for cardiometabolic outcome [1, 2] . Visceral adipose tissue is often associated with metabolic syndrome, conferring an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus with subsequent higher morbidity [1, 2] .

The odds ratio, as derived from the model adjusted for age and sex, was 1.37 (95% CI 1.07 -1.89) regarding ICU treatment. This means that patients were 1.37 times more likely to require ICU treatment than patients with 10 cm 2 less VFA. Similarly, those patients were also 1.32 (95% CI 1.04 -1.91) times more likely to require mechanical ventilation compared to patients with 10 cm 2 less VFA. In 2016, the World Health Organization estimated that 1.9 billion adults were overweight and of these, over 650 million were obese [9] . Overall obesity is a state of low-grade systemic inflammation, which contributes to the development of metabolic diseases, such as dyslipidemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and may modify immune responses, making the immune system more susceptible to infection [10] . This could also play an important role in the pathogenesis of respiratory disorders [11] . In the context of influenza virus infection, obesity has been suggested to impair memory CD8+ T cell responses to infection, resulting in more severe lung pathology and higher mortality [12] . Particularly central obesity with intra-abdominal deposition of visceral fat tissue has been closely linked to cardiometabolic disorders [13] . Visceral adipose tissue, known to be more metabolically active than subcutaneous adipose tissue, has unique endocrine functions and secretes a variety of adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and leptin [12, 14] . Apart from insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, elevated IL-6 levels are known to be related to chronic inflammatory airways disease, and recent studies report higher levels of IL-6 in COVID-19 non-survivors [15, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 16] . Early findings from Italy suggest that IL-6 receptor inhibition by administration of the monoclonal antibody tocilizumab might improve respiratory function in COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome [17] . In addition, leptin was previously found to be related to airway reactivity, and initial findings suggests that leptin levels are elevated in COVID-19 patients with more severe pulmonary inflammation [18, 19] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1217, "end": 1220, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1488, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1575, "end": 1579, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1772, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1916, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2184, "end": 2188, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2192, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2413, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2445, "end": 2451, "text": "12 16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2670, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2873, "end": 2877, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2878, "end": 2881, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 434, "end": 441, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Association between fat area measurements and COVID-19 severity"}, {"text": "With the shift of COVID-19 epicenters to Europe and now especially North and South America, the impact of obesity on COVID-19 may gain in importance, as these two continents have some of the highest prevalence of obesity worldwide, with obesity taking on epidemic proportions [20] ). While previous investigators already identified overall obesity as a risk factor for severe courses of COVID-19, they only used BMI to measure obesity [21] [22] [23] [24] . Compared to recent COVID-19 studies from New York and Lille [24, 25] , which used BMI as a measure of obesity, our ICU patients were of similar age (65.6 \u00b1 13.1 years) as the patients from New York (median 67, ICR 56 -77 years), while patients from Lille were younger (median 60, ICR 51 -70 years) [26] . Regarding median BMI, the Lille center found that COVID-19 patients with a BMI \u2265 35 kg/m 2 required mechanical ventilation significantly more often than COVID-19 patients with a BMI below 25 kg/m 2 [24] ).

Here, several studies suggest that, for the same BMI, the amount of body fat is heavily influenced by age and sex, as women tend to have more fat than men with the same BMI, while older persons tend to have more body fat than younger persons with the same BMI [31, 32] .

In addition, it was reported that visceral fat areas obtained from a single slice and waist circumference obtained at the level of the umbilicus (approximately L4 or L5) were highly correlated to the total visceral fat volume [37, 38] .

This might explain why BMI was not a significant To our knowledge, this is the first study that specifically identifies visceral fat and CT-derived upper abdominal circumference as potential risk factors for severe courses of COVID-19. These indicators can be determined without the need for further imaging simply by performing an automated postprocessing analysis of a standard chest CT scan, provided that it was acquired during routine diagnostic workup. However, it should be noted that a CT-based measurement is obviously not less costly than an anthropomorphic measurement of waist circumference. But other than conventional anthropomorphic measurements, CT-based measurements also allow for an assessment of the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. In addition, even simple measurements, such as measurements of the waist circumference, can be more difficult to obtain in critically ill patients.

Besides, CT-based fat measurements were performed at the level of the first lumbar vertebra instead of the fourth or fifth vertebra and we used the upper abdominal circumference instead of the abdominal circumference. This may have the single-center cross-sectional design. Retrospective epidemiological studies in larger populations as well as autopsy studies and clinical trials with the aim to identify individuals most at risk of becoming infected or of developing complications will be needed for a better selection of individual safety measures. Also, it will be important to determine if it is possible to employ prophylactic and therapeutic measures (e.g., treatment modulating the complement system or IL-6 secretion), and if there are long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on the health of patients with overweight and increased amounts of adipose tissue. Finally, the pathophysiological link between obesity, overweight, visceral adipose tissue and respiratory disease will have to be further investigated. Conclusions Going beyond the recently established association between BMI-based obesity and severe courses of COVID-19, our results suggest that body fat distribution is also important, with visceral adipose tissue and CT-derived upper abdominal circumference significantly increasing the likelihood of severe courses of COVID-19. Hence, CT-based quantification of visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference might be a simple tool for risk assessment in COVID-19 patients.
