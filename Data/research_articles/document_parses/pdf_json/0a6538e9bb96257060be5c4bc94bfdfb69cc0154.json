The absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties of the synthesized molecules were investigated. The results obtained in silico demonstrated that these molecules can be considered as orally active drug candidates due to their physicochemical properties. Also, docking studies demon-strated that all derivatives exhibit a good theoretical affinity with MolDock Score in between 124-138 against the main protease of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19 M pr\u00b0) that caused worldwide epidemics. We believe that newly synthesized norcantharimide derivatives can guide many future studies in organic synthesis, medicine and pharmaceutical applications.",

[1] [2] [3] However, since it is a natural toxin, it is not used in chemotherapeutic studies today. [4] Norcantharidin and norcantharimide, which are derivatives of cantharidin, have gained a great interest due to their less toxic effect. [5] Norcantharidin (2) is the demethylated form of cantharidin. Demethylation reduces not only liver toxicity of cantharidine, but also the biological activity of the obtained norcantharidin. Cantharidin and its analogs are potent inhibitor of serine / threonine protein phosphatase 1 and 2 A (PP1 and PP2 A). [6] [7] [8] [9] It is found that compounds containing norcantharidin ring inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and showed anticancer activity against various cancer cells. Also, current research results show that norcantharimides or isoindole-1,3dion derivatives have a much higher anti-cancer activity on many other types of cancer. For example, Kose et al. synthesized new norcantharimide derivatives and investigated the cytotoxic activities of these compounds. They reported that the new norcantharimide derivatives show high anticancer activity in lung and breast cancer. [10] In recent years, many researchs have been carried out about the anti-cancer and anti-viral effects of cantharidine derivatives. In one of these studies, Cantharidin was used in chemical treatment of viral infection of Molluscum contagiosum (MC) in the skin. [11] Meanwhile, in another study, it was proposed to use Norcantharidin to inhibit HIV in vitro. [12] Yet in the literature, no study can be found on the anti-viral activity of Norcantharimide derivatives. Also, there is no study on the effect of these compounds on COVID-19 M pr\u00b0h as been conducted so far.",
