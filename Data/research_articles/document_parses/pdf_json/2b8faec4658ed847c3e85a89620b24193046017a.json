Larsen, A. Almeldin, T. Tong, et al., Cytochrome P4501B1 in bone marrow is co-expressed with key markers of mesenchymal stem cells. BMS2 cell line models PAH disruption of bone marrow niche development functions, Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology (2020), https://doi.Abstract Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous pollutants that are metabolized to carcinogenic dihydrodiol epoxides (PAHDE) by cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1). This metabolism occurs in bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which sustain hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). In BM, CYP1B1-mediated metabolism of 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) suppresses HSPC colony formation within 6h, whereas benzo(a)pyrene (BP) generates protective cytokines. MSC, enriched from adherent BM cells, yielded the bone marrow stromal, BMS2, cell line. These cells express elevated basal CYP1B1 that scarcely responds to Ah receptor (AhR) inducers. BMS2 cells exhibit extensive transcriptome overlap with leptin receptor positive mesenchymal stem cells (Lepr+ MSC) that control the hematopoietic niche. The overlap includes CYP1B1 and the expression of HSPC regulatory factors (Ebf3, Cxcl12, Kitl, Csf1 and Gas6). MSC are large, adherent fibroblasts that sequester small HSPC and macrophage in the BM niche (Graphic abstract). High basal CYP1B1 expression in BMS2 cells derives from interactions between the Ah-receptor enhancer and proximal promoter SP1 complexes, boosted by autocrine signaling. PAH effects on BMS2 cells model Lepr+MSC niche activity. CYP1B1 metabolizes DMBA to PAHDE, producing p53mediated mRNA increases, long after the in vivo HSPC suppression. Faster, direct p53 effects, favored by stem cells, remain possible PAHDE targets. However, HSPC regulatory factors remained unresponsive. BP is less toxic in BMS2 cells, but, in BM, CYP1A1 metabolism stimulates macrophage cytokines (Il1b>Tnfa> Ifng) within 6h. Although absent from BMS2 and Lepr+MSC, their receptors are highly expressed. The impact of this cytokine signaling in MSC remains to be determined. Graphic Abstract: HSPC, in vivo, are controlled in the BM vascular niche by Lepr+MSC. The mouse BMS2 line J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof models Lepr+MSC regulation, with parallel CYP1B1, HSPC support factors (Cxcl12, Kitl, Ebf3) and cytokine receptor expression. PAHs can produce opposing effects. Rapid suppression of HSPC, effected by CYP1B1-mediated PAH metabolism to PAHDE in MSC (blue), is marked in BMS2 cells by p53-mediated gene activations (DMBA>>BP). Protection arises from in vivo BP metabolism by CYP1A1 that stimulates cytokines from local macrophage (Il1b, Tnf, Ifng), each with corresponding Lepr+MSC receptors. PAH quinones are the probable CYP1A1-mediated protectants.

Constitutive CYP1B1 is also activated by AhR in absence of an exogenous ligand, via disruption of cell adhesion (Cho, et al. 2004; Ziegler, et al. 2016) and by endogenous ligands formed from tryptophan (Seok, et al. 2018; Villa, et al. 2017) . This work shows that CYP1B1 expression in MSC is highly susceptible to autocrine regulation. CYP1B1 metabolizes DMBA and BP to PAHDE, which generate DNA adducts and DSB that activate ATM kinase to phosphorylate p53 (Ganesan, et al. 2013; Gao, et al. 2008) . p53 activation plays an essential role in both HSPC suppression (Page, et al. 2003; Teague, et al. 2010 ) and stabilization of the MSC-HSPC niche (Phinney and Prockop 2007) . We show, here, that the BMS2 transcriptome exhibits expression asymmetry in the pairing of receptor and their respective activators. We identify several strongly expressed pairs that could potentially affect autocrine regulation, notably Pdgfa and Pdgfrb.

BP is appreciably less active and all activities are lost in CYP1B1-ko mice ( Figure 1A ) (N'Jai A, et al. 2011) . Intraperitoneal (IP) (WT, Figure 1A ) and oral administration (all WT, Figure 1B ) of DMBA yielded similar 6h results, but analysis of serum PAH shows that elimination is complete within 24h after oral administration (N'Jai A, et al. 2010) , such that substantial restoration of preB and GM CFU occurs within 48h ( Figure 1B) , with near complete reversal after 168h (Larsen, et al. 2016) . This recovery is noteworthy because we find that DMBA-induced changes in transcription, mediated by CYP1B1 metabolism, are too slow to account for the acute CFU suppression, but closely parallels the recovery process (Table 1A) . These changes in CFU are paralleled in the T lymphocytes in the thymus, which also derive from BM progenitors, but with a delay of about 40h (Larsen, et al. 2016) . Flow cytometry analyses show parallel effects in HSPC progenitor populations (Larsen, et al. 2016) , which follow the CFU changes, preceding the mature BM populations. CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 convert PAHs, like DMBA and BP, to epoxides and phenols by monooxygenation reactions (Li, et al. 2017; Moorthy, et al. 2015) . Epoxides are unstable but are rapidly converted by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (Ephx1) to trans-dihydrodiols or spontaneously rearrange to phenols (Christou, et al. 1990; Gehly, et al. 1979; Pottenger and Jefcoate 1990) . In MSC, like BMS2 or C3H10T1/2, Ephx1 is present at about the same levels as CYP1B1 (Christou, et al. 1990; Savas, et al. 1994; Savas, et al. 1993) .

Gene selectivity for individual PAHDE is structure dependent (Chakravarti, et al. 2008; Dreij, et al. 2005) . The 8h delay almost certainly arises from the time to generate the PAHDE (Keller, et al. 1987) , since the same genes are maximally activated by gamma-radiation in 8h (Fei and El-Deiry 2003; Mirzayans, et al. 2013) .

Evidently, more direct effects of DMBA metabolites produce faster, non-transcriptional steps (Pietrocola, et al. 2013) . For example, apoptosis initiated through Bcl2 in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Vaseva and Moll 2009 ) is a favored p53 intervention in stem cells (TeSlaa, et al. 2016) . The observed 48h recovery from DMBA toxicity (Figure 1 ) may, however, derive from this p53-mediated transcription. Most of the BMS2 genes that respond to DMBA (Tables 1A-C, S1 and S2) are insufficiently expressed to be detectable in MSC at 3 percent of the adherent BM cells. Only three increases (Ccng1, Sulf2 and Phlda3) parallel activations seen in BMS2 cells (Figure 6, Tables 1B and C) . Ccng1 is a potential marker for p53 activation in BM MSC (Reinke and Lozano 1997) . Ccng1 is highly selective to DMBA in both BMS2 cells (Figure 3, Table 1C ) and adherent BM (N'Jai A, et al. The novel, high constitutive CYP1B1 expression in BMS2 cells (Figure 1) is predominantly controlled by a strong coupling between the three AhR/ARNT complexes on the DRE of the AhER and the dual SP1 repeats close to the transcription start site (Figures 4 and 8) . In the basal state, an autocrine boost by growth factor signaling to SP1 is sufficient to avoid external AhR activation. This cooperation may be enhanced by release of \uf062\uf02dcatenin from cell junction sites (Cho, et al. 2005; Ziegler, et al. 2016) . Cell-cell adhesion may suppress CYP1B1 expression by withdrawing \uf062\uf02dcatenin from the nucleus to the junction sites. SP1 is an important regulator of MSC, including for CXCL12, which parallels CYP1B1 in the cell density stimulation ( Figure 5) . SP1 is commonly activated by Erk phosphorylation, including through activation by Pdgfa (Gong, et al. 2017; Schajnovitz, et al. 2011) . This Pdgfa/Pdgfrb pairing is highly expressed, but Hgf/Met and Fgf7/Fgfr2 pairing also activate Erk (Figure 8) . Cxcl12, Tgfb3 and Wnt2 provide additional pairings.

Two Reaction Paths for PAHs lead to opposing effects on HSPC in the BM vascular niche. Metabolites produced by CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 direct these effects.Path A, typified by DMBA, HSPC suppression. CYP1B1 and EPHX1 (microsomal epoxide hydrolase) provide a concerted three step metabolism to generate 3,4-dihydrodiol-1,2-epoxide isomers (PAHDE), marked by DNA adducts in MSC and adjacent pre-B cells(Heidel, et al.   2000). These DNA reactions cause DNA DSB, recognized by rapid activation of ATM kinase and p53 phosphorylation. Hypothesis: p53 activation in MSC and attached HSPC in the vascular niche directly effects apoptosis lineage suppression. PAH dihydrodiols are also J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f converted to PAH ortho-quinones via AKR dehydrogenase that also cause DSB. Evidence for their participation in MSC remains to be shown. Environmental PAH share, with synthetic DMBA, structurally restrained, but more reactive PAHDE, including dibenzo(a,l)pyrene (Fjord ring configuration).Path B, Typified by BP, HSPC protection. CYP1A1, which is induced rapidly to high levels in liver, generates 10 percent of a mix of BP quinones that are highly active in redox cycling to ROS. BP, in combination with AhR induction, generates very high levels of Il1b and other macrophage inflammatory cytokines (Tnf) that activate their specific MSC receptors. The activation is marked by parallel responses induced by Il1b in MSC (Cxcl1, Il6). Il1b stimulates MSC proliferation responses that protect these cells from stress damage. Hypothesis: Il1b mediates early changes that diminish apoptosis in HSPC. Many PAH undergo 1e oxidation at CYP1A1; for example, benz(a)anthracene, but have low AhR inducing activity. Mice have two types of AhR. Inducible b-type (C57Bl6 mice) and resistant d-type (DBA and 129 strains) in which liver CYP1A1 is very low. BP then functions like DMBA with exclusive CYP1B1-mediated suppression (N'Jai A, et al. 2011).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "DMBA and BP effects mediated by direct AhR activation in BMS2 cells.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Gene </td><td>TCDD (8h) </td><td>BP (8h) </td><td>BP (24h) </td><td>DMBA (8h) </td><td>DMBA (24h) </td></tr><tr><td>Stimulation </td><td>FC </td><td>FC </td><td>FC </td><td>FC </td><td>FC </td></tr><tr><td>Cyp1a1 92.2 </td><td>70.6 </td><td>66.8 </td><td>45.7 </td><td>141.4* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Ahrr 4.7 </td><td>4.6 </td><td>7.9* </td><td>3.8 </td><td>7.8* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Aldh3a1 4.6 </td><td>2.9 </td><td>1.4ns </td><td>3.5 </td><td>4.5* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Tiparp 6.6 </td><td>4.6 </td><td>4.0 </td><td>3.1 </td><td>3.5 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Nqo1 2.9 </td><td>2.6 </td><td>2.5 </td><td>1.9 </td><td>2.5* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Adh7 2.2 </td><td>2.1 </td><td>2.3 </td><td>1.7 </td><td>2.4* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Ptx3 2.8 </td><td>2.2 </td><td>2.7 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>3.2* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Inhbb 2.7 </td><td>2.4 </td><td>3.0 </td><td>1.9 </td><td>2.7* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Arl6ip5 2.7 </td><td>2.1 </td><td>1.7 </td><td>1.8 </td><td>1.7 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Ccno 2.0 </td><td>2.1 </td><td>2.4 </td><td>1.8 </td><td>2.5* </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Gchfr 2.1 </td><td>2.0 </td><td>1.8 </td><td>1.4 </td><td>1.9* </td></tr><tr><td>oTable 1B.
