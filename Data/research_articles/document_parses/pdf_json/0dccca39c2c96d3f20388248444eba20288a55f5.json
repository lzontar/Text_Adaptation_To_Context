We complement this important information by presenting a survey conducted among German patients with IBD regarding their personal evaluation of their work-related risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. In Europe-as in many other regions of the world-people are now facing contact restrictions because of the COVID-19-pandemic. Thus, returning to work becomes an increasingly important issue-also from a socioeconomic point of view. Considering the viewpoint of patients with IBD is very important for the patients' health care management in the next phase of the pandemic.",

Of the participants, 60.2% feared a SARS-CoV-2 infection and 57.6% were worried about going to work because of a potentially increased infection risk. Half of the participants (49.4%) believed that IBD predisposed them to a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 compared with their colleagues who did not have IBD. Consequently, 18.8% of the survey participants received a \"preventive\" sick certificate for a duration of more than 7 days from their general practitioner even if they did not show any symptoms of an infection. Of the participants being treated using azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, 27.1% reported using this strategy, as did 26.5% of those treated using antitumor necrosis factor \u03b1 treatment, 25% of those treated using prednisolone, 20.7% of those treated using ustekinumab, 19.1% of those treated using budesonide, and 10.8% of those treated using vedolizumab.",

            "text": "Liberally issuing preventive sick certificates may be an exceptional strategy used for individual patients experiencing stressful life circumstances. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey participants have used this coping strategy frequently. They also reported that they have delayed the decision on whether it is safe to go to work because of divergent or ambiguous opinions of their physicians as well as expert opinions from other sources (internet sources, media). Clearly, the ability to work is very important to most patients with IBD. Still, returning to work is often hampered by uncertainties because of the pandemic. Therefore, straightforward recommendations stating clearly who is at risk and who should avoid which type of work are very important for managing the daily life of our patients. In addition, public financial support for patients who cannot go to work must be considered.
