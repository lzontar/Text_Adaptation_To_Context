We find a positive relationship between the testing rate per 1,000 people and the implied true detection rate of COVID-19, and a negative relationship between the proportion who test positive and the implied true detection rate.

Quantifying the true infection rate is an urgent health priority because, as late as the middle of March 2020, it was observed, and widely cited, that the data collected until that time were unreliable as a means to estimate the true infection rate 1 .

Sero-surveys provide an estimate of the number of people in the sample who have antibodies to the virus at a given point in time. To provide an estimate of the level and trend of the true infection rate, such testing needs to be repeated regularly and for an appropriately stratified random sample of the population. A challenge with sero-surveys is that the tests are subject to both false positives and false negatives and, in the case of serological testing for COVID-19, tests have been made available without the oversight required to ensure sufficient quality and accuracy 13 . Consequently, some tests are performing inadequately 14 . Another difficulty with serological tests is that, if the true rate of infection is relatively low (say 1% or less), then the number of false positives or false negatives may render sero-surveys unreliable as means to estimate the true infection rate.
