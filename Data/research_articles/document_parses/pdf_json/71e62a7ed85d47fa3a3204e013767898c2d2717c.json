As of this writing, there are nearly 450,000 confirmed cases and over 14,000 deaths in the U.S., with confirmed cases surpassing 1.5 million worldwide. 1 But other diseases, like firearm injuries, continue unabated. At best, interpersonal violence is taking place at baseline rates; at worst, violence is escalating. And it feels that way to all of us working in urban trauma centers. Recent data supports this observation. In Philadelphia, there were 141 shootings in March, making it Philadelphia\"s worst March for gun violence in 5 years. During the first 10 days alone of Philadelphia\"s \"Stay At Home\" order, there were 52 shooting victims in the city ( Figure) . 2 The basis for this uptick is unclear. It is hard to say at this point whether the phenomenon we have seen represents a significant increase or random variationonly time will tellbut orders to stay at home are certainly not reducing gun violence. As we have seen from early data, COVID-19 affects racial and socioeconomic groups differently, likely due in part to the fact that many cannot afford to stay home. 3, 4 The inability of society\"s most disadvantaged Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Rapid testing is used prior to transfer to the intensive care unitif clinically appropriateto triage patients to negative pressure rooms and COVID-19 dedicated units in an attempt to reduce exposures. N95 masks are now standard for all trauma resuscitations and aero-digestive procedures. While presently we are fortunate enough to have adequate PPE at a time when shortages have become a national issue, conservation of equipment is imperative. We reuse items when appropriate, carefully plan procedures so as to limit entrances and exits from a patient\"s room, and limit the number of providers participating in procedures to the minimum possible. An increase in the volume of violence also increases the need for PPE use. Now is the time for national guidelines and best practices for trauma systems around the country in the context of a pandemic.

We applaud this change and urge others to do the same. As this pandemic progresses, it may force us into the uncomfortable position of weighing maximum public health benefit against individual patient benefit.

While many people are consumed by the fear of virus transmission, for some, this risk pales in comparison to the baseline risk of community violence and is superseded by the need to carry on with everyday activities for survival.
