Compared with traditional small-molecular drugs, antibody therapies are relatively easy to develop and as specific as vaccines in targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and thus attract much attention in the past few months. This work reviews seven existing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with three-dimensional (3D) structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Five antibody structures associated with SARS-CoV are evaluated for their potential in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. The interactions of these antibodies with the S protein receptorbinding domain (RBD) are compared with those of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and RBD complexes. Due to the orders of magnitude in the discrepancies of experimental binding affinities, we introduce topological data analysis (TDA), a variety of network models, and deep learning to analyze the binding strength and therapeutic potential of the aforementioned fourteen antibody-antigen complexes.

By June 17, 2020, more than 8.2 million individuals were infected and 443,000 fatalities had been reported. Currently, there are neither specific drugs nor effective vaccines available [7] . Traditional drug discovery involves a long and costly process, requiring more than 10 years to put an average drug on the market. Vaccine development typically takes more than one year. In contrast, developing potent SARS-CoV-2 specified antibodies that are produced from blood B cells in response to and counteracting SARS-CoV-2 antigens is a less time-consuming and more efficient strategy for combating the ongoing pandemic [7, 29, 34, 47, 54, 62, 70, 71, 78, 82, 85] . Antibody (Ab), also called immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large, Y-shaped protein that typically consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. A heavy chain can be separated into two regions, the constant region and the variable region. Moreover, each light chain has two successive domains, the constant domain and the variable domain. The two heavy and two light chains of an antibody are connected through disulfide bonds within the constant region [50] . An antibody binds the antigenic determinant (also called epitope) through the variable regions in the tips of the heavy and light chains. Each of these chains contains three complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which located in the tips of each variable domain. Most of the diversities between antibodies are generated within the CDRs, which determine the specificity of individuals of antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 330, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 760, "end": 763, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 764, "end": 767, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 772, "end": 775, "text": "47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 776, "end": 779, "text": "54,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 780, "end": 783, "text": "62,", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 784, "end": 787, "text": "70,", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 788, "end": 791, "text": "71,", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 792, "end": 795, "text": "78,", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 796, "end": 799, "text": "82,", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 800, "end": 803, "text": "85]", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1282, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Benefit from the broad specificity of antibodies; antibody therapies have been proven to be a promising way to fight against cancer, autoimmune disease, neurological disorders, and infectious viruses such as HIV, Ebola, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) [10, 56, 73] .

However, plasma-based therapeutics cannot be produced on a large scale. Therefore, seeking potent industrial-scale antibody therapies becomes one of the most feasible strategies to fight against SARS-CoV-2.

Many researchers have reported the binding affinities of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in complex with antibody candidates and ACE2. However, these reported values may vary by two orders of magnitude for a given antibody due to different experimental methods, conditions, calibrations, and human errors, which hinders the development of antibody therapies for SARS-CoV-2.

As molecular structures are able to reveal the molecular mechanism of antibody-antigen interactions, we only focus on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibodies that have three-dimensional (3D) structures released on the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Since antibodies may directly compete with ACE2 for binding to the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), the structure and binding affinity of ACE2 and S protein complexes are studied to understand the efficiency of antibodies. Moreover, since the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 80% amino acid sequence identity [67] , SARS-CoV S protein antibodies potential candidates for COVID-19. Therefore, we review five existing SARS-CoV S protein antibodies and analyze their binding affinities with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Furthermore, we employ topological data analysis (TDA), artificial intelligence (AI), and a variety of network models to address literature controversy and provide a unified paradigm for ranking the potency of all antibodies. Finally, we review the clinical trials of COVID-19 antibody candidates. An antibody can be divided into different parts according to its functions. Specifically, the \"arms\" of the Y-shaped protein contain sites that can recognize and bind to specific antigens. This region of the antibody is called a Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region and composed of one constant domain and one variable domain from each heavy (VL) and light chain (VH) of the antibody [50] . Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the antibody. The variable domain (Fv region) is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, on light and heavy chains, complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) composed of three variable loops of \u03b2-strands are responsible for binding to a specific antigen. The CDRs are incredibly variable, allowing a large number of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen so that the enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens [41] . This antibody paratope diversity is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene to create further diversity [14, 40] . It has been estimated that humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies [22] . The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is named an Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region and is composed of two heavy chains. The Fc region ensures each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of Fc receptors or other immune molecules. This process activates different physiological effects, including recognition of opsonized particles, lysis of cells, and degranulation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils [31, 77] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 668, "end": 672, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1557, "end": 1561, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2252, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2509, "end": 2513, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2517, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2605, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3123, "end": 3127, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3128, "end": 3131, "text": "77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1564, "end": 1572, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids also produce heavy-chain-only antibodies (HCAbs).

This single variable domain typically can acquire affinity and specificity for antigens comparable to conventional antibodies. VHHs can easily be constructed into multivalent formats and have higher thermal stability and chemostability than most antibodies do [12, 15, 25, 38, 55, 65] .

Antibodies have two physical forms, a membrane-bound form called the B-cell receptor (BCR), which is found to attach to the surface of B cells, and a soluble form that moves freely in the blood plasma. The BCR facilitates the activation and subsequent differentiation of B cells into either plasma or memory B cells. The activation of B cells has two mechanisms: T cell-dependent (TD) activation and T cell-independent (TI) activation [42] . In the TD activation, once a BCR binds a TD antigen, the antigen is taken up into the B cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, degraded, and presented to T helper (TH) cells as peptide pieces in complex with major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II) molecules on the cell membrane [1] . TH cells recognize and bind these MHC-II-peptide complexes through their T cell receptor (TCR). Following TCR-MHC-II-peptide binding, T cells express the surface protein CD40L as well as cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-21. These signals promote B cell proliferation, immunoglobulin class switching, somatic hypermutation, and guide differentiation. Once receiving these signals, B cells are activated [11] . In the TI activation, T cells are absent and B cells receive signals from recognition and binding of a common microbial constituent to toll-like receptors (TLRs) or extensive crosslinking of BCRs to repeated epitopes on a bacterial cell [42] . The TI activation is rapid, but antibodies generated from it tend to have a lower affinity and are also less functionally versatile than those from TD activation [42] . After activated, B cells can be differentiated into plasma cells or memory B cells to generate and secrete antibodies. Memory B cells can even survive in a human body for years to remember the same antigen and trigger a fast response upon future exposure [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 577, "end": 581, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1282, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1526, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1691, "end": 1695, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1956, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Antibodies protect our health in four ways: first, their Fab regions can bind to pathogens, so that prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells; second, they trigger the removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; third, they stimulate the destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway [51] ; at last, antibodies can also lead to vasoactive amine degranulation against certain types of antigens such as helminths and allergens [31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 373, "end": 377, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 514, "end": 518, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The antibody mechanism enlightens the development of vaccines and antibody therapies.

Rather than extracted from convalescent patient plasma, mAbs are made from identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell so that they can have a monovalent affinity to the same epitope. As a result, the most significant advantage of mAbs over conventional small-molecular drugs is their high specificity, which facilitates precise action [30] . The second advantage is their long half-lives, which allows infrequent dosing [39] . Third, molecular engineering technologies have enabled the structure of mAbs to be fine-tuned for specific therapeutic actions and to minimize immunogenicity [26, 44, 49, 66] , thus enhancing their safety. This is reflected in mAbs having an approval rate of around 20% compared with 5% for new small-molecular entities [52, 53] . Finally, mAbs can be developed in a short time period, such as 5-6 months [35] . Currently, mAbs have already established their therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against cancer, autoimmune disease, neurological disorders, and infectious viruses such as HIV, Ebola, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) [10, 56, 73] .

Consistent with the 3D alignment, except for S309, CR3022, and VHH-72, all the other antibodies have their epitopes overlapping with the ACE2 binding site, especially the residues from 486 to 505 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (corresponding to the residues 472 to 491 of the SARS-CoV RBD). Although the VHH-72 epitope residues do not overlap with the ACE2 binding site, VHH72 occupies parts of the space of the ACE2 binding site, which will disrupt the ACE2 binding with RBD. Therefore, VHH-72 also has a competitive binding ability against ACE2. Figure 5 also reveals that these epitope residues have many mutations from SARS-CoV-2 RBD to SARS-CoV RBD, which could explain why most of the antibodies lack cross-reaction to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

Next, the GBT is an ensemble method that builds a powerful module for regression and classification problems as weak learners. The method sums the weak learners to eliminate the overall error based on the assumption that each learner is likely to make different mistakes. According to the current prediction error on the training dataset, the ensemble method is built upon a decision tree structure.

Therefore, a more efficient strategy in fighting against COVID-19 is to look for antibody therapies, which is a relatively easier technique compared to the development of small-molecular drugs or vaccines. Seeking possible antibody drugs has attracted increasing attention in recent months. Moreover, complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which located in the tip of the antibody, determine the specificity of antibodies and make the antibody therapies a promising way to fight against COVID-19.

Using computational topology, machine learning, and wide class network models, we put all of the complexes in an equal footing to evaluate binding and interactions.
