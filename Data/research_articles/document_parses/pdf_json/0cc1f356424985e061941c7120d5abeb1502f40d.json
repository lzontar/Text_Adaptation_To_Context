Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is divided into 18 serovars, and the cross protection efficacy of epitopes is debatable, which has resulted in the slow development of a vaccine. Consequently, epitope-based vaccines conferring Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae cross protection have rarely been reported. In this study, B cell epitopes in the head domain of trimeric autotransporter adhesin were predicted, and 6 epitopes were selected. Then, the predicted epitopes (Ba1, Bb5, C1, PH1 and PH2) were connected by linkers to construct a recombinant tandem antigen (rta) gene. The RTA protein encoded by the recombinant rta gene was expressed, and finally the ICR mice were immunized with the RTA protein with or without inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (serovars 1 and 5b) and challenged with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae to evaluate the protective effect of the epitope-based vaccine and combined vaccine. The mice in the RTA-immunized group and RTA plus inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae vaccine group had a significant improvement in clinical symptoms and a higher level of antibody in the serum than those in the control group. The RTA immune group had a 40% survival rate after Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection, whereas the combination of RTA and inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae produced very strong cross immune protection in mice, at least 50% (RTA IB1 + C5) and at most 100% (RTA IB5 + C1), whereas no cross immunoprotection was found in the solo Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae immune group. Overall, the combination of the RTA protein and inactivated bacteria significantly enhanced the cross protection effects. This implies that RTA protein in combination with a suitable inactivated Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strain could be a candidate vaccine for porcine contagious pleuropneumonia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Porcine contagious pleuropneumonia caused by A. pleuropneumoniae is a serious respiratory infectious disease in pigs. It often causes acute outbreaks and is characterized by a high mortality rate, which causes very large economic losses in the global pig industry (Jeffrey et al. 2012 ). There are 18 serovars of A. pleuropneumoniae (Bosse et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018) , and the lack of cross immunoprotection among the major serovars has slowed the development of a vaccine. At present, research on an A. pleuropneumoniae vaccine has focused on the pilus protein (Sadilkova et al. 2012) , lipopolysaccharide , outer membrane protein (Xie et al. 2016) , adhesion (Zhou et al. 2013 ) and A. pleuropneumoniae toxin (Apx) exotoxin (Wu et al. 2018) , which are involved in colonization, maintenance, lesion induction and host defense escape (Chiers et al. 2010) . Apx toxins can be divided into four types, Apx I-IV; Apx IV exists in all serovars of A. pleuropneumoniae strains (Schaller et al. 1999 ) and is necessary for virulence (Liu et al. 2009 ).

Due to the large number of A. pleuropneumoniae serovars, heterogeneous serovars cannot provide effective immune protection (Bosse et al. 2002) . In the process of vaccine production, certain external factors may also reduce the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Different virulence factors are present in different serotypes, for example, APXI, is present in serovars 1, 5, 9, 10, 11, resulting in different immunization efficacies of inactivated whole-bacterium vaccines (Ramjeet et al. 2008; Seah et al. 2002) . Therefore, commercially available inactivated vaccines do not provide complete protection against all serovars. Epitope-based vaccines are a new type of vaccine that has been developed in recent years. The characteristics that make these vaccines good candidates for their development are as follows: (i) Good safety and stability are conducive to convenient transportation and storage. (ii) Epitope-based vaccines can be produced in large quantities by genetic engineering. (iii) Specific antibodies produced against a small epitope can bind to the whole antigen with high specificity. (iv) Epitope-based vaccines can effectively stimulate the production of an effective immune response and avoid the side effects associated with targeting the nonepitope parts of the antigen, for example, hydrophobic amino acid sequences (Yin et al. 2016) .

However, due to the complex subunit structure, there are few effective antigenic epitopes exposed on the surface of the protein that could cause a cross immune-protection response. Therefore, the epitopes of ADH were predicted by software and connected in series with the Ba1, C1, Bb5, PH1, and PH2 epitopes found by our group through a flexible linker (GSG) to form an epitope antigen. Then, the RTA protein was expressed, purified, and used to immunize mice that were subsequently challenged with A. pleuropneumoniae.

In this study, the RTA protein produced a 40% protection rate in APP-infected mice. This result may be due to the high proportion of ADH epitopes in the RTA protein, whose protective effect was not as good as that of other polypeptide epitopes. The reason may also be that the selected linker is not optimal and causes changes to the RTA protein spatial structure due to intermolecular forces, thus blocking some of the key epitopes in the middle of the protein. In addition, the epitopes in the RTA protein are linked together, which limits the activity of each epitope and prevents specific immune responses to each epitope, thus reducing the protective effect of the RTA protein. This problem can be effectively overcome by immunizing mice with the combination of the RTA protein and inactivated bacteria, especially coimmunization of RTA with inactivated APP5b, which produced a 100% survival rate in mice challenged with APP1.
