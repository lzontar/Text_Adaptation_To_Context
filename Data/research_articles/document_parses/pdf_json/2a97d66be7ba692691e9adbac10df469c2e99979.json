This paper summarizes the results of an infectious disease surveillance program, initially designed to monitor the infectious agents associated with clinically normal and clinically ill cheetahs in captivity, but subsequently supplemented with data from free-living cheetahs. The focus was on two viral infections, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and feline rhinotracheitis virus. Results indicated that between 1989 and 1991, there was an increase in the seroprevalence (number antibody-positive animals) of cheetahs to feline coronavirus from 41% to 64% in captivity. During this same time period, there were only two documented cases of FIP in cheetahs in the United States.

During the course of this study there were only two cases of FIP reported in the cheetah population, which may indicate one of several things. This low level of FIP mortality may be indicative of the control efforts that have been used in various cheetah collections (based upon serologic-directed quarantine); the changing virulence of the feline-cheetah coronavirus in nature; the lowered number of coronavirus-naive cheetahs in captivity; or a combination of the above.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 282, "text": "[Evermann et al., 1988", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 283, "end": 307, "text": "[Evermann et al., , 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 308, "end": 337, "text": "Evermann and McKeirnan, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 338, "end": 357, "text": "Junge et al., 19911", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 623, "end": 640, "text": "[Pedersen, 19911.", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The earlier findings of feline herpesvirus infection being associated with clinically ill as well as clinically normal cheetahs is compatible with our knowledge of the pathogenesis of this virus in domestic cat populations [Povey, 19861 . The isolation of feline herpesvirus from a clinically normal cheetah confirms that asymptomatic shedding can occur and may account for the infection of susceptible animals, especially cubs [Evermann and McKeirnan, 19911. The serologic profile of the 39 free-living cheetahs points to several interesting observations. First, it exemplifies the use of serologic testing for surveillance purposes to assess the degree of infection within a given population of animals [Hancock, 1988; Heeney et al., 1990; Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979; Munson, 19911 . Second, the high seroprevalence of feline coronavirus antibodies (61.5%) indicates that a coronavirus of cheetahs is endemic in at least one cheetah population living in East Africa. This observation supports the earlier reports of coronavirus seropositive cheetahs in the wild [Evermann et al., 1988; Horzinek and Osterhaus, 19791 . The fact that certain populations of cheetahs, either in captivity or in the wild, have remained seronegative to feline coronavirus may be reflective of the lack of exposure to a cheetah coronavirus or to the other coronaviruses known to cross-react with the feline coronaviruses, i.e., porcine coronavirus and canine coronavirus [Spencer, 19911. The third observation indicates a high seroprevalence of free-living cheetahs to feline herpesvirus (43.6%), previously considered to be predominantly an infection and disease of captive cheetahs. The occurrence of seroreactive cheetahs in the wild raises many questions in regards to the ecology of these viruses and the practicality of trying to maintain colonies of cheetahs that are free of infection.

Pathogenesis refers to the potential for the virus to cause disease at the host animal level, which invariably involves target organs and preferential cells for virus replication. Epidemiology is the study of the ecology of an infectious agent in order to understand the pathogenesis, and ultimately control it.

According to Pedersen [ 199 11 , there are many factors which influence the outcome of infections. These include: the host response; the environment in which the host lives; and microbial agents to which the host is exposed. Of particular interest with regard to the cheetah are those factors of the host response, primarily those pertaining to developmental and heritable anomalies of the immune system. O'Brien and Evermann [1988] reviewed reports on the genetic homogeneity of the cheetah and postulated that this homozygosity may reflect lack of immunologic diversity to infectious agents. In a series of experiments, the immune response of the cheetah has been reported as being suboptimal, based on the lack of rejection of skin grafts and the lack of demonstrable neutralizing antibodies to FIP virus [McKeirnan and Evermann, unpublished data; O'Brien et al., 19851. Pedersen [1987] cautions against the use of skin testing for measuring the effectiveness of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in domestic cats. Although cats do not respond well to some antigens, they have been shown to develop measurable levels of delayed hypersensitivity to certain chemicals. Nonetheless, there appears to be some differences in the cell-mediated immune response of domestic cats as measured by decreased lymphocyte reactivity to T-cell mitogens, and this observation may apply to cheetahs as well. Recent evidence now supports the altered T-cell function of the cheetah [Miller-Edge and Worley, 19921 . In that study, there was a decrease in T-cell responsiveness of cheetah peripheral blood mononuclear cells, when compared with domestic cats, when the cells were cultured with inactivated feline herpesvirus. These experiments, as well as those of other investigators, suggest that the susceptibility of the cheetah to viral infections and the severity of disease are the result of an immune-compromised host [Miller-Edge and Worley, 19911 . This understanding will allow for us to pursue strategies for augmenting the cheetah's immune response, which should include genetics as well as managing cheetahs to reduce the risk of high exposure to potentially fatal pathogens, and the development of effective and safe vaccines to aid in the control of such diseases [Hohdatsu et al., 1991; Lin, 19921 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 314, "end": 331, "text": "Pedersen [ 199 11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 718, "end": 733, "text": "Evermann [1988]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1151, "text": "[McKeirnan and Evermann, unpublished data;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1190, "text": "O'Brien et al., 19851.
