Thus, health authorities should consider deviations from the 54 current standard of care until definitive therapy can be delivered. 6 It is worth noting that 55 we relied this overview on current available recommendations from international and 56 national societies of gastroenterology/hepatology.

We aimed to overview the recommendations 7 provided by national and international gastroenterology/hepatology societies for the 8 management of patients with chronic liver diseases or liver transplantation during the 9 COVID-19 pandemic.10 We searched websites of 125 national and international societies of 11 gastroenterology/hepatology from 7 international associations and 83 countries to 12 extract data on the recommendations for management of patients with chronic liver 13 disease, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver 14 transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample included 15 recommendations for patients with chronic liver disease from 20 national or 16 international societies, seven specifically concerning patients with AIH, seven for those 17 with HCC and nine on liver transplantation (Supplementary Material). Six societies 18 stated to follow recommendations from other societies. Therefore, we analyzed the 19 recommendations from 14 societies (Table 1). Briefly, all societies recommended the 20 use of telemedicine (100%) and 12 societies (86%) temporarily postponing non-urgent 21 appointments. Questionnaire of symptoms (29%) and/or patient's body temperature 22 measurement (29%), limiting the number of consultations/day and restricting number of 23 family/companions (57%) were recommended in case of face-to-face consultation. Few 24 societies recommended checking influenza/Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination 25 (29%), delaying HCC surveillance (29%) and/or postponing all elective/non-urgent 26 liver biopsy or elastography (29%). A majority of the societies recommended 27 temporarily postponing all elective/non-urgent endoscopy exams (86%) and to continue 28 immunosuppressive therapy (93%). On the other hand, few societies recommended 29 testing for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with hepatic decompensation. 30 Concerning patients with AIH, HCC or liver transplantation, telemedicine was 31 extensively recommended for patients with AIH or liver transplanted (86%), but in 32 lower rates for patients with HCC (57%) (Supplementary Material). The maintenance of 33 the same dosage of immunosuppressive agents was highly recommended for patients 34 with AIH (86%) or liver transplantation (100%). The majority of societies (67%) 35 recommended performing SARS-CoV-2 testing for liver transplantation recipients and 36 donors. All seven societies with recommendations for patients with HCC recommended 37 continuation of HCC therapy and four (57%) of them continuing to perform regular 38 exams during the pandemic. Most societies recommended to perform liver 39 transplantation only for life-threatening situations, such as HCC or acute liver failure. 40The impact of COVID-19 in patients with liver diseases or liver transplantation 41 remains unclear. Preliminary results of combined data from registries that have been 42 collecting outcomes of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 in patients with liver diseases 43 showed high mortality rates in patients with cirrhosis. 2 However, there are no published 44",

Furthermore, while we wait for effective vaccines, the 61 knowledge of the extent of immunity in each country will later guide health authorities 62 to elaborate strategies when facing a potential second wave of COVID-19. Patients with 63 cirrhosis and those under immunosuppressive medicines should be prioritized for 64 testing until further evidenced-based data become available. In summary, worldwide 65 gastroenterology and hepatology societies support the use of telehealth for managing 66 patients with liver disease or liver transplantation. Hepatology and liver transplantation 67 providers should follow the current recommendations to protect their patients during the 68 COVID-19 pandemic. However, future studies addressing the impact of COVID-19 in 69 patients with chronic liver diseases or liver transplantation are urgently needed.",
