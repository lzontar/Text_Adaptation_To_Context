Sequences from several different countries have been found in the same clusters while sequences from the same countries have not been found in the same cluster. No separated clade is evident, but all the sequences are part of the same clade. The mutation on the amino acid position 3691 does not appear to be associated within the same cluster with sequences with a leucine on the residue position 9659. Moreover 3 sequences have been found to have a mutation on both the 3691 and the 9659 amino acidic positions. Sequences with a histidine on the position 9659 have been found to belong to distinct clusters. At any rate, clustering of sequence presenting amino acidic mutations did not indicate geographical/epidemiological link with the patients from whom SARS-CoV-2 was isolated ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . No reliable homology model could be built using SwissModel and HHpred servers. For this reason, the three-dimensional model of NSP6 has been downloaded from I-Tasser website. ( https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/C-I-TASSER/ 2019-nCov/QHD43415 _ 6.pdb.gz ). The structural analysis performed using TMHMM and Protter servers have shown that NSP6 protein has 7 putative trans-membrane helices like in other coronaviruses. 19 The MEME analysis has shown evidence for episodic synonymous mutations mostly concerning the 3rd codon and not impacting on the overall proteomic asset of the virus. Regarding the FEL analysis, the presence of potential sites under positive selective pressure have been found on 2 sites, on the amino acidic positions 3691 and 9659. These mutations fall on NSP6 and on a region near the Open Reading Frame 10 (ORF 10), respectively. The amino acidic change stability (ACS) analysis has shown that both mutations lead to a lower stability of the protein structures. Namely, at amino acid position 3691 (corresponding to NSP6 position 37), most of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences have a leucine residue while some more recent sequences from Asia, America, Oceania and Europe isolates show phenylalanine ( Table 1 ) . Both amino acids are non-polar, but phenylalanine has a benzoic ring in the side chain which may stiffen the secondary structure by means of aromaticaromatic, hydrophobic or stacking interactions. The ACS analysis has shown that this mutation lead to a lower stability of the protein structure ( Fig. 1 ) . The mutant position is predicted to be at the C-terminal side of the first transmembrane helix corresponding to the first outer membrane site, close to a sequence region rich of phenylalanine residues (from NSP6 residue position 32 to 40: SLFFFFYENA) of SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 1 b) . According to the structural model, the mutant position is part of a constellation of aromatic residues which includes, in addition to the sequentially contiguous residues, Trp31, Phe42 and Phe45 ( Fig. 2 ) . Jpred attributes a helical conformation also to the cytosolic portion of the segment connecting the first to the second transmembrane helix which may facilitate hydrophobic interactions among these aromatic residues.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 912, "end": 933, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2164, "text": "( Table 1 )", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2461, "end": 2471, "text": "( Fig. 1 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2741, "end": 2750, "text": "Fig. 1 b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2948, "end": 2958, "text": "( Fig. 2 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "At have a histidine residue.

Almost all countries have been affected and some of them are now experiencing a rampant rise of disease cases with severe consequences on the stability of health systems. Since disease probable emergence in a wet market of Wuhan, city in the Hubei region of China and recognition of its causative agent, a number of studies on SARS-CoV-2 genome have been published and showed its close similarities (and differences) with the genomes of other coronaviruses isolated from bat, snake, pangolin and SARS CoV. 20 -22 Now the attention of most investigators is focused on the potential capability of the viral genome to evolve through mutation, recombination and gene gain and losses, as verified in other human coronaviruses. 23 Despite contrary expectations, the selective pressure analysis reported here points out that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 has so far undergone very few mutations, which mostly affect the 3rd codon, and are synonymous, meaning are not going to influence the general molecular structure of this new virus. In addition, it remains difficult to prove the biological relevance of these mutations by pure bioinformatic approach, in the absence of experimental correlates.

We posit that some of these mutations can provide the virus with useful adaptations in its fight to persist and multiply within humans. We have particularly assessed two SARS-CoV-2 mutations of non-structural viral proteins, NSP6 and an aminoacidic region near ORF 10, with particular interest into the former protein. NSP6, a common component of both \u03b1 and \u03b2-coronaviruses, locates to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and generates autophagosomes. 24 We notice that the presence of multiple phenylalanine residues in the outer membrane region of NSP6 should favor the affinity between this region and the ER membrane inducing a more stable binding of the protein to ER. It has been shown that this binding may favor coronavirus infection by compromising the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation. 25 Thus, its role would be to limit autophagosome expansion, directly or indirectly by starvation or chemical inhibition of mTOR signaling. 26 Nonetheless, the role of autophagy in viral infection is a double-edge sword and we don't have direct evidence that NSP6 mutation does in fact favor viral replication and evasion from cellular immunity or the opposite. In this context, it should be noted that mutational protein analysis speaks for a lower stability of NSP6 upon changing phenylalanine from leucine, but it should be considered that ACS analysis doesn't consider trans-membrane position and other protein interactions. Regarding the aminoacidic region near the ORF 10, previous studies performed on the SARS-CoV reported a 29 nucleotides deletion segment disrupting ORF 9 and, simultaneously, eliminating ORFs 10 and 11. The clinical significance of this deletion is unclear also because it has been found to co-exist with the non-deleted variant in the same host and same clinical specimen (25) .
