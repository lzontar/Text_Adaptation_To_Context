            "text": "In this paper, we develop a first principles model that connects respiratory droplet physics with the evolution of a pandemic such as the ongoing Covid-19. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time, accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer, and finally, crystallization of the dissolved salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. The droplet evaporation/desiccation time is, indeed, dependent on ambient temperature and is also a strong function of relative humidity. The multi-scale model thus developed and the firm theoretical underpinning that connects the two scales-macro-scale pandemic dynamics and micro-scale droplet physics-thus could emerge as a powerful tool in elucidating the role of environmental factors on infection spread through respiratory droplets.",

            "text": "It has been well established that the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic transmits via respiratory droplets that are exhaled during talking, coughing, or sneezing. 1 Each act of expiration corresponds to different droplet sizes and myriad trajectories for the droplets embedded in the corresponding jets. Wells 2, 3 was the first to investigate the role of respiratory droplets in respiratory disease transmission. Expelled respiratory droplets from an average human being contain dissolved salt with a mass fraction of about 0.01 as well as various proteins and pathogens in varying concentrations. 4, 5 In this paper, to model the outbreaks, we extensively use the evaporation and settling dynamics of NaClwater droplets as a surrogate model of the infectious droplets. Stilianakis and Drossinos 6, 7 included respiratory droplets in their epidemiological models. However, they neglected the droplet evaporation dynamics and assumed that characteristic post-evaporation droplet diameters are half of the pre-evaporation droplet diameters based on Nicas et al. 8 In the context of the present Covid-19 pandemic, while the role of droplet nuclei and corresponding \"aerosol transmission\" route are not clear, 1 it is widely accepted that respiratory droplets are definitely a dominant vector in transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This merits a detailed investigation of the evaporation dynamics of respiratory droplets and development of a pandemic model that is explicitly dependent on the respiratory droplet characteristics. As such, the evaporation mechanism of respiratory droplets are laced with complexities stemming from droplet aerodynamics, initial droplet cooling, heat transfer, mass transfer of the solvent and solute, respectively, and finally, crystallization of the solute-a phenomenon known as efflorescence. All these Physics of Fluids ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/phf are strongly affected by ambient conditions in which the droplet evaporates. These urgently necessitate a model based on first principles, which connects the detailed evaporation dynamics of respiratory droplets with the pandemic evolution equations. In this paper, a model for the infection rate constant based on collision theory incorporates the evaporation physics of respiratory droplets, ab initio. The droplet evaporation model thus developed is first validated with new experimental results obtained from droplets observed to evaporate in an acoustic levitator. While very interesting insights can be obtained from sessile droplet evaporation, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] after an expiratory event, the floating droplet evaporates in the absence of surface contact. Thus, the levitated droplets are similar to the droplets in atmosphere [14] [15] [16] compared to their sessile counterpart. Furthermore, the desiccation dynamics necessitates a contact-less environment for the droplet. Alongside a droplet evaporation model, a chemical kinetics based reaction mechanism model is developed with final rate equations similar to that yielded by the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model. 17 In general, the resemblance of the equations modeling kinetics to those of population dynamics is well known. However, the rigorous framework (analytical as well as computational) of chemical reaction mechanisms that can at present handle few thousands of species and tens of thousands of elementary reactions seems particularly attractive. 18 This could be utilized toward adding further granularity in the pandemic model, if required large mechanisms can be reduced systematically with mechanism reduction techniques. 19 Furthermore, it can be integrated into advectiondiffusion-reaction equations, and their moments could be solved using appropriate moment-closure methods. 20, 21 However, for any reaction mechanism, the key inputs are the parameters for the reaction rate constant. In our case, one rate constant is shown to be a strong function of the droplet lifetime. Therefore, next, the droplet lifetime is evaluated over a wide range of conditions relevant to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and the growth rate exponents (eigenvalues) are presented. The results do not suggest that factors not considered in this paper play a secondary role in determining the outbreak spread. Rather, this paper aims to establish the mathematical connection between the pandemic and the respiratory droplet dynamics using a well defined framework rooted in physical sciences. This paper is arranged as follows: first, we provide details of the experiments used to obtain the evaporation characteristics of the water and salt solution droplets. This is followed by the reaction mechanism model that yields the equations for the growth rate and the infection rate constant of the outbreaks. This infection rate constant provides the connection and motivation for modeling the droplet evaporation time scales. Next, to evaluate the rate constant, detailed modeling of the droplet evaporation is presented. This is followed by results and discussions. Finally, we summarize the approach and findings in Sec. VII.",

A range of initial droplet diameters varying from 300 \u03bcm to 1000 \u03bcm were investigated in experiments.",

In reality, during coughing, talking, or sneezing, the droplets are exhaled in a turbulent jet/puff. 16 However, as shown in Eqs. (10) and (11), the puff rapidly decelerates due to entrainment and lack of sustained momentum source, rendering the average VD,P to be less than 1% of the initial velocity. Furthermore, since the Prandtl number, defined as ratio of kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity, is approximately unity (Pr = \u03bd/\u03b1 \u2248 0.71) for air, we can safely assume that the temperature and relative humidity that the droplets in the puff experience are on average very close to that of the ambient. At the initial stages, the puff will indeed be slightly affected by buoyancy, which will influence droplet cooling and evaporation dynamics. Quantifying these effects accurately, merit separate studies, see for e.g., Ref. 32 for buoyant clouds. In a higher dimensional model, these could be incorporated. Nonetheless, the evaporation rate of the droplet is driven by the transport of water vapor from the droplet surface to the ambient far field.

This limit is such that the droplet surface temperature will be lower than the ambient, implying a positive temperature gradient or heat input. The heat subsequently transferred from the ambient to the droplet surface after attaining the wet-bulb limit is used completely for evaporating the drop without any change in sensible enthalpy.

The transient analysis, thus, becomes critically important in determining the evolution of the droplet surface temperature and instantaneous droplet size. During evaporation, the mole-fraction of the solute increases and attains a critical super-saturation limit, which triggers precipitation. The precipitation and accompanied crystallization dynamics, essentially, reduce the solute mass dissolved the in liquid phase, leading to a momentary decrease in its mole-fraction. This, in turn, increases the evaporation rate as mandated by Raoult's law, which subsequently increases the solute concentration. These competing mechanisms control evaporation at the latter stages of the droplet lifetime. At a certain point, due to continuous evaporation, the liquid mass completely depletes and evaporation stops. The droplet after complete desiccation consists only of salt crystals, probably encapsulating the viruses and rendering them inactive. If the SARS-CoV-2 virus would remain active within the salt crystal, also known as droplet nucleus or aerosol, Covid-19 could spread by aerosol transmission in addition to that by droplets.

Particularly, the droplets with (1% w/w) NaCl solution vaporized to shrink to 30% of its initial diameter during the first stage of evaporation, as shown in Fig. 3 . Hereafter, a plateaulike stage is approached due to increased solute accumulation near the droplet's surface, which inhibits the diameter from shrinking rapidly. However, as shown in Fig. 3 , shrinkage does occur (until Ds/Ds ,0 \u2248 0.2) as the droplet undergoes a sol-gel transformation. The final shape of the precipitate is better observed from the micrographs presented in Fig. 3 . Figure 3 shows the final precipitate morphology for the desiccated droplets. The precipitates display a cuboid shaped crystalline formation, which is consistent with the structure of the NaCl crystal. The size and crystallite structure does show some variation, which could be linked with the initial size of the droplet. Only precipitates from larger droplets could be collected since smaller sized precipitates tend to de-stabilize and fly-off the levitator post-desiccation. While the precipitate from larger sized droplets tend to yield larger and less number of crystals, smaller droplets seem to degenerate into even smaller crystallites. However, this work does not investigate the dynamics of morphological changes of crystallization in levitated droplets. Figure 3 also displays the comparison between results obtained from experiments and modeling. Experiments were performed with both pure water droplets as well as with droplets of 1% salt solutions. Experiments have been described in Sec. II. For the pure water cases shown in the left panel, simulation results follow the experiments rather closely. In the pure water case, classical D 2 law behavior could be observed. For the salt water droplets, a deviation from the D 2 law behavior occurs, and droplet evaporation is slowed. This is governed by Raoult's law where the reduced vapor pressure Pvap(Ts, \u03c7 1,s ) on the droplet surface results from the increasing salt concentration with time. The evaporation rate approaches zero at about Ds/Ds ,0 for 0.3 (experiments) and 0.25 (simulations), respectively. However, the salt concentration attained at this stage exceeds the supersaturation S \u2265 1 required for onset of crystallization. Thus, the salt crystallizes, reducing its concentration and increasing Pvap(Ts, \u03c7 1,s ) such that evaporation and water mass loss can proceed until nearly all the water has evaporated and only a piece of solid crystal as shown in Fig. 3 is left. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that in all cases, the final evaporation time is predicted within 15% of the experimental values. This suggests that despite the model being devoid of complexities (associated with inhomogeneities of temperature and solute mass fraction within the droplet and simple one step reaction to model the crystallization kinetics), it demonstrates reasonably good predictive capability. It is prudent to mention again that although we have done the analysis for the single isolated droplet, in reality, coughing or sneezing involves a whole gamut of droplet sizes in the form of a cloud.",

            "text": "Clearly, for any condition, while tevap monotonically increases with Ds ,0 , t settle monotonically decreases with Ds ,0 . In view of this, it is necessary to estimate the maximum time an exhaled droplet can remain within the collection volume without being evaporated or settled. Such a time can be estimated by defining a characteristic droplet lifetime \u03c4, where \u03c4 = min{ tevap | tevap \u2265 t settle \u2200D s,0 }. (25) \u03c4 is essentially the time where the two curves tevap, tevap as a function of Ds ,0 intersect and represents the maximum time a liquid droplet of any size can exist before it is removed either by evaporation or gravity. For a given ambience specified by the ordered pair (T\u221e, RH\u221e), Ds ,0 corresponding to \u03c4 can be defined as Dcrit. Droplets with Ds ,0 > Dcrit settle due to gravity, while Ds ,0 \u2264 Dcrit evaporate, earlier than the droplets with Ds ,0 = Dcrit. While droplets with Ds ,0 \u2260 Dcrit can certainly transmit the disease, those with Dcrit establishes the boundaries in terms of the lifetime, cloud diameter, and maximum distance traversed. Dcrit is dependent on ambient conditions, i.e., temperature and relative humidity. The distribution of Dcrit over a wide range of relevant ambient conditions is shown in Fig. 4(a) . Interestingly, at high T\u221e and low RH\u221e, where the evaporation rate is very fast, even a large droplet rapidly shrinks before it can settle. By the same argument at low T\u221e and high RH\u221e, a relatively smaller droplet cannot evaporate quickly; therefore, tevap = t settle is attained for smaller droplet sizes. This explains why we observe large Dcrit at high T\u221e, low RH\u221e, and small Dcrit at low T\u221e and high RH\u221e. The evaporation time of the droplet of diameter Dcrit, which has been established as the characteristic lifetime \u03c4 of the droplet set, is shown in Fig. 4(b) . Despite the different initial sizes, we find that \u03c4 is minimum at high T\u221e and low RH\u221e conditions, whereas it is maximum at low T\u221e and high RH\u221e. At the same time, longer lifetime, i.e., large \u03c4, allows the droplet cloud to travel a longer distance axially (Xp) and disperse radially (\u03c3D). Thus, XP and \u03c3D are 4(d) . This also shows how the minimum required \"social distance\" represented by Xp is not constant but depends on ambient conditions. Combining these results, it can be concluded that the size, lifetime, distance traveled, and the radial dispersion of the longest surviving droplet is not constant and is a strong function of ambient conditions. In particular, low temperature and high RH enhance the droplet lifetime significantly. Relative humidity strongly affects the droplet lifetime compared to temperature. An increase in droplet lifetime also implies that such droplets stay in the ambient for longer periods and hence travel longer distances as reflected by Xp. This implies that such droplets can lead to higher infection propensities. The critical size, droplet lifetime, distance traveled, or size of the droplet cloud for any practical condition are readily obtainable from Figs. 4(a)-4(d), respectively. In Fig. 5 , we look into the evolution of the normalized mass and temperature of the droplets for two cases named as case A and case B, also identified with black dots in Fig. 4 . For case A, (T\u221e, RH\u221e) = (8, 55), while for case B, (T\u221e, RH\u221e) = (28, 77). The unit of T\u221e is \u25cb C and that of RH is %. These conditions have been specifically chosen to loosely represent the spring weather in North America and South East Asia, respectively, for the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic at both these locations. Figure 5 clearly explains why \u03c4A > \u03c4B. Indeed, higher RH at case B implies that the temporary hiatus in evaporation due to reduced vapor pressure is reached at a higher water mass load of the droplet than at the case A condition. In both cases, this occurs at about 3 s. However, the higher temperature in B results in faster crystallization kinetics due to the Arrhenius nature of the equation given by Eq. (19) , which causes an eventual faster crystallization rate than at A. Figure 5 clearly shows that although the knee in the solvent depletion profiles are attained at the same time, it is the crystallization and simultaneous desiccation dynamics that governs the eventual difference in lifetime of the droplets at two conditions. It remains to be seen whether this result holds for a detailed crystallization reaction mechanism. The temperature evolution plots shown in the right panel of Fig. 5 also reveals how the droplet initially exhaled at 30 \u25cb C rapidly cools to the corresponding wet-bulb temperature to subsequently allow heat transfer into the droplet leading to evaporation. However, as the salt concentration reduces due to crystallization, the temperature rises subsequently above the corresponding wet-bulb limits.",

            "text": "With the droplet lifetime available over a wide range of conditions, the corresponding infection rate constant and eigenvalues given by Eqs. (5) and (6) could be evaluated. Just to recapitulate, \u03c4 determines the infection rate constant k 1 by Eq. (14) . In turn, k 1 affects the exponents of the time dependent infection equation [Eq. (7)], the growth parameters-eigenvalues \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 through Eq. (8) . The contours of \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , and k 1 as a function of T\u221e and RH\u221e are shown in Figs. 6(a)-6(c), respectively. The direct correspondence between \u03c4 and k 1 is immediately apparent upon comparing the respective Figs. 4(b) and 6(c). The infection rate constant is highest at low T\u221e and high RH\u221e where the droplet evaporation is slowed due to the slow mass loss rate and enhanced crystallization time. On the other hand, faster droplet evaporation leads to small infection rate constant values at high T\u221e and low RH\u221e. The temperature and relative humidity dependency of the eigenvalues \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), respectively. The direct correspondence of Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) with Fig. 6 (c) and Fig. 4 are established through \u03bb 1,2 = \u22120.54 \u00b1 \u221a 0.22 + k 1 given by Eq. (8) . It should, however, be noted that due to the inherent negative sign of \u03bb 2 , its influence on determining the growth rate of the infected population is rather limited. It is \u03bb 1 that primarily drives the growth of the infected population as apparent from Eq. (7). From Fig. 6 (a), we observe that for a fixed T\u221e, \u03bb 1 increases with RH\u221e, while for a fixed RH\u221e, \u03bb 1 decreases with T\u221e. Furthermore, we observe that the iso-\u03bb 1 contour lines bend and converge at RH\u221e > 75%. This means that for RH\u221e > 75%, large \u03bb 1 > 0.4 is expected over a wider range of temperatures between 5 \u25cb C < T\u221e < 20 \u25cb C. This is a manifestation of the greatly reduced evaporation potential-the difference between water vapor concentration on the droplet surface and in the ambient at high RH\u221e conditions. This is further reflected in the dramatic difference in the rate ratio-the ratio of the cumulative number of positive cases on a particular day to the cumulative number of positive cases seven days before: NP/NP ,0 in Fig. 6(d) . This figure has been arrived at by assuming the local population density to be 10 000 km \u22122 . Furthermore, we calculate tc in Eq. (14) as tc = 3600 \u00d7 24/Nexp. Nexp is the number of infecting expiratory events per person per day and is assumed to be 3 based on the coughing frequency of 0-16 in normal subjects. 37 We find that purely based on ambient conditions, implying all other factors have been held constant, the rate ratio can be different by an order of magnitude between (T\u221e, RH\u221e) = (5, 75) vs (35, 20) . Practically, such a contrast might be less apparent in real data in which other important factors such as population density, social enforcement, travel patterns, and susceptible supply 38 exert significant influence.",

The model and its inter-dependencies on the different physical principles/sub-models are summarized in Fig. 7 . To our knowledge, this is the first model that utilizes the structure of a chemical reaction mechanism to connect the pandemic evolution equations with respiratory droplet lifetime by first principles modeling of the reaction rate constant. However, it must be recognized that the model assumes conditions where transmission occurs solely due to inhalation of infected respiratory droplets alongside many other simplifying assumptions. The evolution of the droplets is characterized by a complex interaction of aerodynamics, evaporation thermodynamics, and crystallization kinetics. As such, after being ejected, smaller droplets attain the wet-bulb temperature corresponding to the local ambience and begin to evaporate. However, due to the presence of dissolved salt, the evaporation stops when the size of the droplet reaches about 20%-30% of the initial diameter, but now, the droplet salt concentration has increased to levels that trigger onset of crystallization. Of course, these processes compete with settling-the process by which larger droplets fall away before they can evaporate. The smaller of the two, complete evaporation time and settling time, thus dictates the droplet lifetime \u03c4. The infection rate constant derived using collision theory of reaction rates is shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime (\u03c4), where \u03c4 is sensitive to ambient conditions. While the infection rate constant in reality is dependent on numerous parameters, the present approach allows us to compute its exclusive dependence on ambient conditions through respiratory droplet modeling. We find that the respiratory droplets exclusively contribute to the infection growth parameters and infection growth rate, which decrease with ambient temperature and increase with relative humidity. As such, the model could be used for providing fundamental insights into the role of respiratory droplets in Covid-19 type viral disease spread. Furthermore, the model could be used, with extreme caution and in cognizance of its limitations, toward estimating the risk potential of infection spread by droplet transmission for specific ambient conditions of interest from purely physics based calculations.",
