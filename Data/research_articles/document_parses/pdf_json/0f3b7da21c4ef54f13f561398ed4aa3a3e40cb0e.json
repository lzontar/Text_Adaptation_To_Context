While rapid, these methods are also dependent on the quality of fluorescence reagents and the expertise of the person interpreting the results of the tests and have inherently low sensitivity. Enzyme immunoassays in a micro-plate format are not widely used for human influenza diagnostics but the immuno-assay principle has been adapted for rapid antigen detection (rapid diagnostic tests) by flow-through or lateral flow devices. Sensitivity and specificity of antigenic tests depend not only on the test technique, but also on factors like type of specimen analysed, quality of specimen and timing of specimen collection (related to viral shedding). 10 Based on published data, sensitivities for detection of human influenza H1N1 or H3N2 in rapid diagnostic tests are approximately 70-75% while specificities are approximately 90-99%. It should be noted that sensitivity of such methods for direct detection of H5N1 has been disappointing so far. The analytical sensitivity of currently available antigen http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/guidelines/case_definition2006_08_29/en/index.html detection test kits for influenza A remains too low for reliable use as POC tests for direct detection of H5N1 virus in clinical specimens. But if the sensitivity of such methods can be enhanced, they may become useful for H5N1 rapid testing. 11 Detection of viral RNA The use of molecular techniques to identify specific gene sequences provides a sensitive method for diagnosis. Furthermore, their use can potentially reveal the genetic sequence of the virus which is useful for molecular epidemiology and provides other important characteristics of the virus, including antiviral resistance status, occurrence of genetic reassortment or presence of key virulence mutations. While some of this information can be obtained by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified viral cDNA, more detailed molecular analysis typically requires prior virus amplification by culture. PCR is used widely now, with thermocyclers and other requisite equipment available in many national laboratories throughout affected regions although maintenance of the assays requires regular update of generic information. The multiple test steps (extraction, amplification, detection) and reagent preparation are highly sensitive to minor changes and requires experienced personal working within good quality systems. In particular, the amplification reaction of viral nucleic acids makes it susceptible to cross-contamination, unless stringent measures to avoid such contamination are in place. 12 'Chip technology', which includes miniaturized approaches to genetic sequence detection may also allow simple, automated, rapid and economical PCR testing on a large scale, but automated systems are still expensive, and availability of a POC chip platform is at least 4 years away.
