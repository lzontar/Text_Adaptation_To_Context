            "text": "Our understanding of the dynamics of complex networked systems has increased significantly in the last two decades. However, most of our knowledge is built upon assuming pairwise relations among the system's components. This is often an oversimplification, for instance, in social interactions that occur frequently within groups. To overcome this limitation, here we study the dynamics of social contagion on hypergraphs. We develop an analytical framework and provide numerical results for arbitrary hypergraphs, which we also support with Monte Carlo simulations. Our analyses show that the model has a vast parameter space, with first-and secondorder transitions, bistability, and hysteresis. Phenomenologically, we also extend the concept of latent heat to social contexts, which might help understanding oscillatory social behaviors. Our work unfolds the research line of higher-order models and the analytical treatment of hypergraphs, posing new questions and paving the way for modeling dynamical processes on higher-order structures.",

In particular, new and relevant phenomena arise when investigating social and biological contagion processes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . For instance, while homogeneous spreading models predict finite critical points [2, 6, 7] , heterogeneous networks often present vanishing transitions [1, 2, [6] [7] [8] , supporting the predictions in real-world networks [9] [10] [11] [12] . Contagion models cover many aspects, from different types to richer substrates underlying the process itself. A relevant development is the extension of contagion processes to multilayer networks, leading the way to combinatorial higher-order models. Indeed, multilayers' structural [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , spreading [7, 14] , and diffusion properties [13, 18] have new and richer phenomenology. Nevertheless, as recently argued in Ref. [19] , real data are revealing that pairwise relationships-the fundamental interaction units of networks-do not capture complex dependencies.",

In other words, modern information spreading is often a one-to-many process. Additionally, biological and team collaborations are also inherently group structured, similarly to some types of molecular interactions [20] . Complementary, there is evidence from social and biological studies indicating that higher-order structures have crucial dynamical effects [21] [22] [23] [24] . Therefore, higher-order interactions are ubiquitous, and understanding their properties and impacts is of paramount importance. Notably, the sizes of such groups can span orders of magnitude.

Hypergraphs relax the structural restrictions required by simplicial complexes as they impose virtually no limitation on the type, size, and mutual inclusion of interactions, thus, representing more faithfully and naturally real systems. From the dynamical viewpoint, we incorporate explicit critical-mass dynamics (each hyperedge is an independent critical-mass process), generalizing the one modeled in Ref. [22] . The resulting model displays a rich complex phenomenology, remaining very flexible and able to cover a wide range of systems. We uncover the presence of discontinuous transitions and bistability led by higher-order interactions and critical-mass dynamics. Notably, these critical properties contrast with contagion models on graphs-models, which instead usually display continuous transitions, e.g., SIS or SIR disease spreading, regardless of the structural configuration. Therefore, assuming a graph projection of a hypergraph might lead to wrong results. Here we report analytical and numerical analyses of the theoretical framework that we introduce as well as results for several limiting cases and hypergraph structures. We round ",

On the other hand, if for each hyperedge with |e j | > 2 its subsets are also contained in E, we recover a simplicial complex (for more on the hypergraph structure, see the Supplemental Material [28] , Sec. I). Figure 1 shows an example of a hypergraph. In an arbitrary hypergraph, we associate with each individual v i a Bernoulli random variable Y i (complementary X i ).

[28] for more details. Figure 2 shows the general phenomenology of the system obtained from the analytical solution, i.e., the first-order approximation, of the equations describing the contagion dynamics for the hyperblob. As can be seen in Fig. 2(a) , there are two possible solutions, \u03c1 Lower and \u03c1 Upper . The solution depends on the initial conditions and the threshold, * , which, together with the structure, defines a value \u03c1 c where the dynamics exhibit a discontinuity. If \u03c1(t = 0) \u03c1 c , the solution is given by \u03c1 = \u03c1 Upper (forward phase diagram). On the other hand, if \u03c1(t = 0) < \u03c1 c and \u03c1(t = 0) = 0, then \u03c1 = \u03c1 Lower (backward phase diagram). The arrows show these solutions as the size of the jump (i.e., the magnitude of the latent heat). Note that the lower solution can exhibit a secondorder phase transition. Next, in Fig. 2(b) we instead represent the corresponding parameter space, which is composed of five distinct regions, as explained in the figure caption. We assumed the most general case, where the lower solution has a transition from the absorbing state to an active state, here at \u03bb c . We remark that, for some structures, the lower solution might have a vanishing critical point (e.g., the hyperstar), i.e., \u03bb c \u2192 0, thus slightly changing this picture. Finally, we have compared both analytic and numeric estimates of the latent heat for this hypergraph structure. The results show that the absolute error between analytical and numerical simulations is of order 10 \u22122 -10 \u22123 in hypergraphs with N = 10 4 (see Ref. [28] , Sec. VI.E and Table I ), indicating that the first-order approximation is accurate.",

Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show that the order parameter and the susceptibility follow the patterns expected for a first-order transition, i.e., both are discontinuous. Moreover, the order parameter is bistable, implying the presence of a hysteresis loop. This phenomenon is opposed to an SIS on a graph. The SIS has a second-order phase transition, characterized by a continuous behavior of the order parameter and a diverging susceptibility in the thermodynamic limit. Complementarily, Fig. 3(c) shows the distribution of active nodes in the upper and lower branches. In the former, we have a bell-shaped distribution, similar to the supercritical regime of an SIS process [7, 30] . In the latter, we have a distribution peaked at one, similar to the subcritical regime (absorbing state) of an SIS process [7, 30] . We emphasize that Fig. 3(c) displays the distribution of active nodes for the upper (left panel) and lower (right panel) branches and that the complete distribution for a given \u03bb in a region where both solutions exist is bimodal. Intuitively, one expects that lower cardinality hyperedges are responsible for the lower branch as they are easier to activate than the higher cardinality ones. Note that, in regular cases, such as the hyperblob (see Ref. [28] , Secs. III and IV), the giant pairwise component has N nodes. However, for the exponentially distributed cardinality scenario, this is not the case. Although P (|e| = 2) P (|e| = k), k = 3, 4 . . . , N (exponential distribution), the largest connected component, is very small, six nodes in the simulated hypergraph. Therefore, in this scenario, the lower branch is determined by hyperedges with cardinality lower but greater than two. The generality of the reported phenomenological behavior suggests that the observed dynamics are a consequence of group-group interactions. Additional experiments (reported in Ref. [28] ) for a hypergraph with a power-law distribution of cardinality further corroborated these results. In all systems, we found similar qualitative behavior for finite networks.",

These works reported critical mass levels needed to change an established equilibrium of 10% in some experiments and 30%-40% in others, in apparent contradiction. The formalism here developed naturally brings forth plausible hypotheses for these observations and show that both ranges are possible. On the one hand, studies based on a single group suggest a threshold between 30%-40%, a situation that can be modeled as a single hyperedge in our formalism. On the other hand, a critical mass of 10% would correspond to a population that is composed of groups of diverse sizes, each one with a (larger) activation threshold. In other words, it is possible to have individual groups exhibiting a threshold * between 30%-40%, and at the same time, a global critical mass, \u03c1 c , for the whole population of about 10% due to group intersections. A second reason that could explain the experimental findings is even more straightforward: admittedly, the fact that our model shows bistability also enables, for a given \u03bb, two possible solutions for \u03c1 corresponding to the lower and the upper branches. That is, the system might be operating in the region where both solutions are larger than zero and stable.",

            "text": "In summary, in this paper, we have developed a framework that allows extending the study of social contagion models when group interactions are relevant. This is achieved by considering hypergraphs as the substrates that capture such many-to-many interactions. First, our work opens the path to deal with new dynamical processes on top of higher-order models and specifically on hypergraphs. Second, we showed that simple dynamical processes could exhibit very rich dynamics, with different transitions, bistability, and hysteresis. Hypergraphs are ubiquitous, and our theory suggests that such a structure allows for the phase diagram reported here. Several findings support the relevance of this methodology. We remark that, depending on the structure, traditional graphprojected models may lead to wrong results. Ultimately, the uncovered phenomenology allows explaining seemingly contradictory experimental findings in which group interactions play a major role. We also mention that many interesting questions arise from our work. For instance, if one assumes that energy is proportional to \u03c1, our model might display phenomena reminiscent of a Carnot cycle for social contexts, which might help to understand abrupt changes and oscillatory patterns in social behaviors.",

The transition from the lower to the upper solution (upper to lower) occurs at the intersection of the lower (upper) solution with a value of \u03c1 c in which the upper solution became stable (unstable). The discontinuity is characterized by the latent heat, Q l (\u03bb L c ) or Q l (\u03bb U c ). At \u03bb c = 0.2, the lower solution shows a second-order phase transition. (b) Schematic of the parameter space: Region I: the absorbing state for both the lower and upper solution; Region II: only the lower solution is stable (the global critical mass is not reached, \u03c1 < \u03c1 c ); Region III: \u03c1 Upper is stable and \u03c1 Lower = 0 (below the critical point); Region IV: \u03c1 Upper > \u03c1 Lower > 0 and both are stable (bistable); Region V: only the upper solution is stable (the global critical mass was reached, \u03c1 \u03c1 c ).",
