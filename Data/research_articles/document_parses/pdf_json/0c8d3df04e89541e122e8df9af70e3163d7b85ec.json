Unprecedentedly, COVID-19 place huge burden on every part of healthcare system directly and indirectly.

Moreover, we cannot evaluate whether some AMI patients did not seek any care at all or they may have died before any medical contact.COVID-19 outbreak may cause treatment delay in MI and potentially lead to worse clinical outcome.
