Recently, reliable universal culture media have been developed to screen for CR. 5 Here, we studied the impact of non-absorbed oral colistin on the emergence of CR in the gut microbiota of patients from the RGNOSIS-WP3 randomized controlled trial. 6 Thirty-nine subjects colonized with MDR-E were randomized to receive oral colistin sulfate 2 MIU 4 times a day + neomycin sulfate 500 mg bid for 5 days followed by a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from healthy donors, or no intervention. Stool samples were collected on visit V0 (screening sample), V2 (after 5 days of oral decontamination and before FMT for the intervention group), V3, V4 and V5, respectively 5-10 days, 30-40 days and 150-210 days later. 6 Stool samples from donors and 15 subjects from the intervention group and 15 from the control group were available for this work and plated on Drigalski plates (control) and SuperPolymyxin R plates. 5 Colony forming units (CFU) counts of all Gram-negative rods were determined. Isolates growing on Superpolymyxin R plates were identified by MALDI-TOF; CR was confirmed by the culture-based Rapid Polymyxin NP test and MIC determined by the microdilution method. The limit of detection was 10 2 CFU/g of stool. CR-E. coli were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq technology. To determine whether CR isolates were present before the intervention, a specific mcr-1 PCR was performed on patients stool prior to intervention (V0) and on the donor's stool. 7 Electroporation of plasmids was performed to localize the gene conferring resistance to colistin and neomycin and molecular typing of the electroporants was performed using PCR based replicon typing (PBRT). \u2729 Universit\u00e9 de Paris, IAME, INSERM, UMR-1137 No patient or donor included in the trial carried CR isolates on V0. Among the 15 patients in the intervention group two (13.3%, [IC90 \u22121; 3], p = 0.24) carried CR isolates at least at one visit after the intervention ( Fig. 1 ) . No CR-Enterobacterales was detected in the stools of subjects from the control group. Among both subjects with CR-Enterobacterales, one carried 10 Log CFU/g of Hafnia paralvei , a species which is intrinsically resistant to colistin (MIC = 8 mg/L), also resistant to neomycin (MIC = 32 mg/L) on visit 4 and the other carried 1 Log CFU/g and 3 Log CFU/g CR-E. coli at visits 4 and 5, respectively, with a colistin MIC at 8 mg/L. Relative abundance of CR-E. coli increased between V4 and V5 from 0.01% to 1% of the total Enterobacterales population. The CR-E. coli recovered at V4 and V5 both belonged to phylogroup C ST23 group and carried the serotype O176:H9. A plasmid-borne mcr-1.1 gene encoding for CR as well as a aph(3 )-Ia gene conferring resistance to neomycin were identified, both being co-located on the same IncHI2 plasmid. In addition, resistance genes conferring resistance to hygromycin B ( aph(4)-Ia ), sulfonamides ( sul2 ), tetracyclines ( tet(A) ) and phenicols ( floR and catA1 ), all antibiotics used in veterinary medicine, were evidenced. For both subjects, CR strains could not be retrieved in the initial stool of the subject or in the donor's stool. PCR experiments performed with specific primers to detect mcr-1 gene directly on the pre-therapeutic stool were also negative.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 312, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 537, "end": 538, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 710, "end": 715, "text": "3 , 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 987, "end": 988, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1155, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1618, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1819, "text": "5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2369, "end": 2370, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2615, "end": 2623, "text": "UMR-1137", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2842, "end": 2852, "text": "( Fig. 1 )", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "To our knowledge, this is the first report of the in-vivo selection of CR-Enterobacterales in the gut microbiota of patients after oral decontamination by colistin. The selection of CR strains (a naturally-resistant H. paralvei and a mcr-1 producing E. coli ), both resistant to colistin and neomycin, may be the result either of the enrichment process by SOD of preexisting CR strains that had not been initially detected because of very low abundances, or of an exogenous acquisition, either from other individuals or through FMT. 8 Indeed the transmission from FMT of MDR strains from positive donors is a potential risk. 8 Despite our efforts to decrease the limit of detection of MCR producers by using a PCR technique directly on the pre-therapeutic stool sample and the donors' stools, we failed to detect the parental strain, either because CR strains were in intestinal niches, the limit of detection remained too high, or the strain was acquired exogenously. However, the mcr-1 -positive E. coli is likely of animal origin according to its genetic features and its co-resistance profile. 9 Indeed, phylogroup ST23 is frequently encountered among avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) and co-resistances to many antibiotics used specifically in veterinary medicine is striking. 10 Furthermore, the aph(3 )-Ia gene confers resistance to neomycin and paromomycin, the latter commonly used in cattle and pigs. The selection of the MCR-1 producer is an illustration of the \"One Health\" problem of resistance: a strain likely to have been selected by veterinary antibiotics among animals ended up in a patient's gut, later enriched by the use of colistin and neomycin as decontaminant. Although the small number of subjects is a clear limitation, this observation is a \"proof-of-concept\" of the risk of selection of CR-Enterobacterales after oral colistin treatment and FMT, at a time when colistin is one of the last resort antibiotics to treat MDR-Enterobacterales infections. The selection of commensal CR-E. coli is especially worrying, given the pathogenic potential of E. coli and its ability to widely colonize animals and humans. Given the controversial results of oral decontamination by colistin, we believe it should only be used with precautions and with thorough monitoring of CR. We read with interest a recent paper in this Journal by Luzatti and colleagues, 1 who explored the significance of the presence of Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA in lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens for the diagnosis of HSV pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. The authors underlined the difficulty in gauging the clinical relevance of such a laboratory finding in the absence of histopathological data, as HSV shedding in the LRT may occur in the absence of disease. The interpretation of real-time PCR results for diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJ) pneumonia (PJP) faces an analogous challenge, since the presence of PJ DNA in LRT may reflect colonization (carriage) rather than infection. 2 There is limited information on the clinical value of PJ real-time PCR in diagnosing PJP in patients with hematological diseases; 3-6 this is exceedingly challenging as the sensitivity of direct examination procedures is suboptimal due to low fungal burdens. 3 Here, we report on our experience on this matter. A total of 219 episodes of pneumonia occurring in 192 consecutive patients with hematological disorders in which PJP was considered in the differential etiological diagnosis were included. Of these, 127 episodes developed in patients undergoing either allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-allo-HSCT-( n = 86) or autologous-HSCT ( n = 19), and 92 in non-transplant patients (acute leukemia, n = 61; lymphoma, n = 16; chronic leukemia, n = 8; others, n = 2). The patients were attended at the Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario-HCU-( n = 100) or at the Hospital Universitario Polit\u00e9cnico \"La Fe\" -HLF-( n = 92) between June 2014 and August 2019.

Specimens were examined for presence of ascus or trophic forms of PJ by microscopy following blue toluidine, calcofluor white or Grocott's methenamine silver staining. Cytospin preparations were prepared from BAL specimens for direct examination. Sputa and TA samples were mixed v/v with Sputasol (Oxoid, UK) and vortexed for 5 min.

Its causative agent is PRV, which is classified into the genus Varicellovirus of subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae , family Herpesviridae . PRV is almost always fatal in newborn piglets, is frequently accompanied by neurological symptoms, and may cause abortions and/or stillbirths in pregnant sows. PRV primarily infects members of the Suidae family and can also infect other domestic and wild mammals, including horses, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, etc. Currently, vaccination is the most effective strategy for PR prevention and control in pigs worldwide.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dear Editor,"}, {"text": "In China, PRV infections in pigs were first recorded in 1947. In the 1970s, an inactivated vaccine consisting of the Bartha-K61 vaccine strain was imported into China. Since then, this vaccine has been widely used in pig vaccination for PR prevention and control. Before 2011, no large PR outbreaks were reported in pigs in China. However, after late 2011, novel PRV wild-type variants emerged in nearly all regions of China and affected a number of swine herds vaccinated regularly with the Bartha-K61 vaccine, resulting in significant economic losses. 4 Subsequent animal experiments indicated that the Bartha-K61 vaccine could not provide complete protection for pigs against a challenge with novel PRV wild-type variants in China. For control and eradication of PR, the disease was listed in the \"Mid-and Long-term Animal Disease Prevention and Control Program in China (2012-2020)\" by the Chinese government, with the aim of eliminating PR in China by 2020 ( http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2012-05/25/content _ 2145581.htm ). However, vaccination for PRV is still voluntary and not required in China. A nationwide epidemiological investigation in 2014 demonstrated a high prevalence of 23.26% of PRV among swine herds in China. 5 Humans were previously regarded as refractory for PRV infection, although serological PRV antibody positivity was found in three cases. In 2018, the first human PRV infection case with direct molecular evidence was reported in China (Case 1, Table 1 ). 6 In this case, the eyes of a 46-year-old woman were directly exposed to sewage on a hog farm. In the following two weeks, symptoms of fever, headache, coma, and endophthalmitis were observed in the patient. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) indicated that PRV DNA was detected in her vitreous humor samples but not in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). After surgery, the patient was discharged, but her vision remained impaired. In a subsequent study, Zhao et al. Table 1 Clinical characteristics and other information on the twelve human PRV infection cases in China. analyzed CSF samples from four patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology using NGS (Cases 2-5, Table 1 ) and found molecular evidence of PRV infection. 7 In addition, retinitis and blindness was observed in two cases (Cases 2, 5, Table 1 ), and the patient in Case 3 died. The occupation of the four patients was all associated with pork production/sale/cooking. In 2019, six other human PRV infection cases involving encephalitis were reported in China, and all patients were pork/pig handlers or veterinarians. [8] [9] [10] It was noted that all patients still suffered from various sequelae after discharge, except for in one case where the patient died. Increasing reports on human PRV infection cases in China have recently indicated that PRV poses a significant threat to public health in China, especially in people in close contact with sick pigs and/or related pork products/contaminants.

Recently, Sophia David and colleagues 2 reported the epidemic of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in Europe, which raised concern that mobile carbapenemase resistance determinants were widely spread in European hospital settings, and inter-hospital spread is far more frequent within, rather than between, countries. However, limited information regarding the co-occurrence of carbapenemases and mcr genes in the Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) isolates have been provided. Plasmid-mediated resistance genes mcr as well as tet (X3/X4) have been widespread in bacterial species of animal, human, and environment origin as well as human and animal gut microbiomes worldwide, where is a huge ARG reservoir with a high horizontal gene transfer possibility. 1 , 3 -5 Several studies 6 -8 illustrated that the newly described mcr-9 has spread beyond the United States into Europe and Asia, and into other Enterobacteriaceae species. Of clinical concern is the inevitable spread of a plasmid harboring the mcr-9 gene into a CRKP isolate, which has been listed by the World Health Organization as a critical priority antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen for which new antibiotics are urgently needed. 9 In response to this potential clinical problem, we download > 1717 K. pneumoniae genomes isolated from 244 hospitals in 32 European countries 2 and the 14,764 complete bacterial genome sequence (accessed 26 July 2019), and explored the distribution of plasmid-mediated resistance genes mcr and tet (X3/X4).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 234, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1724, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Detection of mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-9 in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains of human origin in Europe"}, {"text": "We are surprised to find that the complete mcr-9 gene (nucleotide = 100%) was present in 28 K. pneumoniae isolates of 1717 K. pneumoniae strains from Belgium ( n = 2), Denmark ( n = 1), Montenegro ( n = 13), Poland ( n = 1), Romania ( n = 2), Serbia ( n = 1), Slovenia ( n = 1), and Spain ( n = 7) (Table S1 ).

These results suggest that mcr-9 gene might have been presented in Europe for a long time and already spread to the CRKP isolates, which is a major cause of both hospital-and community-acquired infections. 2 To further analyze these mcr-9 -positive K. pneumoniae isolates, the resistome of the draft genome was analyzed using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database. 10 Interestingly, the mcr-9 gene was co-existed with various carbapenemase-encoding genes: in eleven isolates with NDM-1, eight with VIM-1, and two with OXA-48 ( Fig. 1 (A) ).

We decided to collect data (initially from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020) in several typical regions of China, including the center of the outbreak (i.e. Wuhan City and Hubei Province), other four most affected provinces (i.e., Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan) and top-4 major cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen). During data analysis on Feb 13, 2020, the number of new confirmed cases on Feb 12 in Hubei Province and Wuhan City suddenly increased by 14,840 and 13,436, respectively, of which 13,332 and 12,364 are those confirmed by clinical features (note: all the number of confirmed cases released by Feb 12 were counted according to the result of viral nucleic acid detection rather than by referring to clinical features). We thus arbitrarily distributed these suddenly added cases to the reported cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14 for Hubei Province by a fixed factor (refer to Table S1 ), assuming that they were linearly accumulative in those days.

Assuming the relative uncertainty follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%, the potential total number and key dates were estimated at 95% CI. For detail, refer to the Methods section and Figs. 1 C, D, S2 and S3.b Key date is determined when the number of daily new confirmed cases is less than 0.1% of the potential total number. tendency to miss-report some positive cases such that the reported numbers represent a lower limit. One typical example indicating this uncertainty is the sudden increase of more than 14 0 0 0 new confirmed cases in Hubei Province on Feb 12 after clinical features were officially accepted as a standard for infection confirmation.Another uncertainty might result from insufficient kits for viral nucleic acid detection at the early stage of the outbreak. We thus examined the effects of such uncertainty using a Monte Carlo method (for detail, refer to the Methods section in SI file). For simplicity, we assumed that the relative uncertainty of the reported data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%. Under the above conditions, the potential total numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 for different regions were estimated ( Figs. 1 C, D, S2 and S3 ) and summarized in Table 1 16 ,092), respectively, indicating that overall the outbreak may not be so bad as previously estimated. 9 Such uncertainty analysis also allowed us to estimate the key dates at 95% CI. As summarized in Table 1 , the key dates for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces would fall in (2/28, 3/10), (2/27, 3/10), (2/28, 3/10) and (2/27, 3/13), respectively.Finally, the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has undoubtedly caused us the memories of the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003. We thus collected the data from the WHO officiate website for analysis, and found that the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV both in China and worldwide were fitted well with the Boltzmann function, with R 2 being 0.999 and 0.998, respectively ( Figs. 1 E and F) .In summary, we found that all data sets, including both the on-going outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China and the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic in China and worldwide, were well fitted to the Boltzmann function ( Fig. 1 and S1 ). These results strongly suggest that the Boltzmann function is suitable for analyzing the epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. One advantage of this model is that it only needs the cumulative number of confirmed cases, somehow as simple as the recently proposed model. 10 In addition, the estimated potential total numbers of confirmed cases and key dates may provide valuable guidance for Chinese central and local governments to deal with this emerging threat at current critical stage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1396, "end": 1398, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1501, "text": "9", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2681, "end": 2683, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1388, "end": 1395, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1605, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2155, "end": 2173, "text": "( Figs. 1 E and F)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2389, "text": "Fig. 1 and S1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "None.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Declaration of Competing Interest"}, {"text": "Supplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi: 10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.019 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Supplementary materials"}, {"text": "We appreciate the work Tang et al. have report emergence of a novel coronavirus in China. 1 The 2019-nCoV broke out in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, and has attracted worldwide attention. [2] [3] [4] Although the Chinese government has taken active measures to control this epidemic, the virus is very infectious. According to the real-time data of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China up until February 5, 2020, within a short period of half a month, the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths were 24,443 and 493, respectively. The epidemic is progressing rapidly. 2019-nCoV poses new public health challenges in China. 5 In Wuhan, China, the number of local medical staff is insufficient for the demand resulting from the explosive increase in the number of infected patients. Therefore, many medical personnel are needed to devote themselves to the front line of combating the virus.Medical personnel throughout the country are led under the unified leadership of the Chinese government. Although the epidemic in Wuhan is serious, a large number of medical staff rushed to Wuhan to supplement the shortage of manpower in Wuhan hospitals. This is a battle without smoke, the heroes of which are our medical staff. According to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, as of January 30, 2020, Hubei Province opened 11,0 0 0 isolated patient beds, and about 170,0 0 0 healthcare professionals from all kinds of medical institutions are working on the front lines and providing care for patients with fevers, and for suspected or confirmed patients.
