The first death from COVID-19 in the state of Indiana was reported on March 16; 65 deaths and 2,565 cases were confirmed by March 31 (2) . Severe COVID-19 is characterized by acute respiratory failure often culminating in the need for mechanical ventilation (3) (4) (5) (6) . Studies have associated increased acute phase reactants and inflammatory markers with severe COVID-19 (3) (4) (5) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Abnormal coagulation parameters have additionally been associated with severe or fatal COVID-19 (11) (12) (13) . These reports describe a biochemical profile suspicious for a prothrombotic and hypercoagulable state characterized by significant elevations in fibrinogen and a rapid unexpected ascent of serum d-dimer. This degree of profound systemic inflammation has a well-known association to a hypercoagulable state (14) . These findings, and anecdotal clinical experience, have generated the hypothesis that a prothrombotic state may play a dominant pathophysiologic role in severe or fatal COVID-19.

The association between elevated d-dimer and VTE development is likely representative of both the degree of systemic inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients and inappropriate activation of the coagulation cascade; however, the degree to which each of these components contribute to VTE development was not possible to determine in this study. The frequency of VTE in severe COVID-19, its risk factors, and outcomes warrant ongoing worldwide investigation, as COVID-19 will likely continue to contribute to worldwide morbidity and mortality for some years. Given the documented hypercoagulability and frequency of VTE in this population, consideration should be given to an escalated dose of chemical VTE prophylaxis using either weight-based or anti-factor-Xa guided dosing in COVID-19 patients with d-dimer greater than 728 ng/mL at presentation. In addition to this increased dosing of chemical VTE prophylaxis, critically ill patients with a d-dimer greater than 2,600 ng/mL (or > 10 times the upper limit of laboratory normal) should be evaluated with four-extremity duplex ultrasound; empiric anticoagulation in the setting of elevated d-dimer and presumptive diagnosis of VTE should be made on a case-by-case basis. Early detection of VTE and prevention of PE in patients with severe COVID-19 is paramount given the mounting clinical and autopsy evidence of lung microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis (12, 13, 19, 29) , which plausibly may be contributing to the progressive and fatal hypoxemic respiratory failure in these patients without prompt initiation of adequate anticoagulation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 393, "text": "(14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 394, "end": 397, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 398, "end": 401, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 402, "end": 405, "text": "27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1829, "end": 1833, "text": "(12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1834, "end": 1837, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1841, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1845, "text": "29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In this series of 12 patients with severe COVID-19 undergoing thromboelastography analysis, 58% met objective criteria for hypercoagulability and 83% of patients had at least one hypercoagulable thromboelastography parameter.

This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated systemic inflammation, in the most severe cases, results in activation of the coagulation cascade. Three of seven patients with a hypercoagulable thromboelastography went on to develop VTE; thus, larger volume, prospective studies may be warranted to evaluate this association further and define the utility of thromboelastography in COVID-19.

Our study corroborates a recently published study that reported hypercoagulable thromboelastography in COVID-19 patients (30) . Thromboelastography represents an objective metric (thromboelastography) to describe the hypercoagulability encountered in COVID-19 and provides a more complete picture of the coagulation cascade compared with traditional laboratory values. Large, prospective studies evaluating thromboelastography could provide detailed insight into the abnormal coagulation in COVID-19. Further, the potential role of platelet activation and aggregation in VTE development can be evaluated with thromboelastography, providing an additional target for improved VTE prophylaxis with antiplatelet therapy.
