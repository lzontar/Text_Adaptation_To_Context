In that study, CFD modeling demonstrated a close relationship between concentration of virus-laden aerosols and the risk of acquiring infection in various ward locations. We studied this outbreak using similar approach, and our findings provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that, under suitable clinical and environmental conditions, aerosol transmission of influenza virus can occur [2, 3] . In this outbreak, we postulate that infectious aerosols were generated continuously through the use of noninvasive ventilation for the index patient (which projected for at least 1 m sagittally to bed end) [29] [30] [31] for 16 h and these aerosols were blown toward the adjacent bay by an imbalanced indoor airflow created by an air purifier's outflow jet, which was located at patient's bed end. We believe that droplets and contact routes of transmission cannot entirely explain the outbreak because (1) the epidemic curve suggested a point-source mode of infection, instead of successive propagation (especially for the aggregation of symptom onset on 2 and 3 April); (2) the index patient and most other inpatients were immobile during their illnesses and, therefore, direct contacts should have been minimal; (3) patients 12 m away were affected; and (4) locations of affected patients coincided with dispersal pattern of aerosols and the directional airflow. In this outbreak, patients in the \"adjacent\" and \"same\" bay were similarly affected, but the \"distant\" bay was spared. A more random distribution of infected cases would be expected if HCWs had acted as vectors, because they were responsible for the care of patients in all bays (duties were assigned on the basis of function and not location) [15] . Similarly, close patient-patient contact, visits to a contaminated common area, and transmission through a wandering, sick visitor are unlikely explanations in our setting [15] .

However, accumulating evidences suggest that the aerosol route may have a contributing role [3, 13, 18, 19] . In animal models, influenza virus (eg, H3N2 or H1N1) has been shown to transmit efficiently through air, whereas fomite or contact spread is relatively inefficient [13, 18, 19, [32] [33] [34] . In clinical studies, virus-laden particles less than 5-6 mm (ie, within the respirable aerosol fraction) have been detected in exhaled breaths of patients with influenza and in the air sampled from an acute healthcare setting during seasonal peak [19, 35, 36] . In contrast to natural coughing or sneezing, artificially generated respiratory particles are often much smaller in size ( less than 5-6 mm), can penetrate more readily into the lower respiratory tract, and can cause infection with a smaller dose [3, 13, 18, 19] . It has been shown that certain clinical procedures (eg, endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, noninvasive ventilation, and receipt of high-flow oxygen) can generate a large amount of respiratory aerosols [8, 9, 13, 16, 18, [29] [30] [31] , and transmission of respiratory infection related to some of these procedures-despite implementation of droplet precautions-has been reported [37] [38] [39] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 109, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 110, "end": 112, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 113, "end": 115, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 116, "end": 119, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 214, "end": 217, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 218, "end": 221, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 222, "end": 225, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 226, "end": 229, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 396, "end": 400, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 409, "end": 413, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 414, "end": 418, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 419, "end": 423, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 673, "end": 677, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 678, "end": 681, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 935, "end": 938, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 939, "end": 942, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 943, "end": 946, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 947, "end": 950, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1178, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1181, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1182, "end": 1185, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1189, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1193, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1198, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1203, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1357, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1362, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1367, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Since the outbreak, we have used a hierarchy of control measures to prevent influenza transmission in our hospital, such as administrative and source controls, engineering controls, and use of personal protective equipment [8, 9] .
