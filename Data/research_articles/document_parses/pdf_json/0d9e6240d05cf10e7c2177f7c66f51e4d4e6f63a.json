In this case, the physician may choose confirmation through biopsies of the transplanted kidney or directly by reduction of immunosuppressive therapy. 47 Some studies have suggested that periodic monitoring directly in the blood may be useful. 50 Recent research has demonstrated the protective role of quinolones in the development of BK virus nephropathy. 51 Although conflicting experiences have been published, recent studies suggest a favourable prognosis for patients who receive a new renal transplant after failure of the previous kidney due to BK polyomavirus nephropathy, especially if viraemia is eliminated before the new transplantation. 52 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 655, "end": 657, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 748, "end": 750, "text": "50", "ref_id":
