It has been reported in cases with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus pneumonia. 2 Although the exact mechanism is unknown, increased alveolar pressure and diffuse alveolar injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia is common which may make the alveoli more prone to rupturing, especially as patients often have pronounced cough. To date, there have been few reports on spontaneous pneumomediastinum from COVID-19 in the setting of non-mechanical ventilation, although some cases have been complicated by pneumothorax. 3 The development of pnemomediastinum in COVID-19 infection is considered a possible indicator of worsening disease, but our patient fortunately survived.",
