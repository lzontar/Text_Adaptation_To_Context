Indeed, combination therapies are preferred to monotherapies as they prevent the development of resistant parasites.

Alternately, the attachment of an organometallic complex to an organic scaffold was already attempted 20 years ago. [3] The idea was to use the organic scaffold of the drug for its primary properties (that is, permeability, uptake, transport, binding to a target) and the organometallic moiety to alter its unwanted properties (that is, resistance) and/or to optimize its initial effects. [4] Ferrocene (Fc) with its sandwich structure was rapidly identified as the metallocene of choice. Indeed, Fc is a small, rigid, lipophilic molecule which can penetrate cellular membranes. Fc is stable in aqueous, aerobic media, and allows the accessibility to a large variety of derivatives. In addition, the electrochemical behavior of Fc makes it very attractive for biological applications and especially for drug design. [5] Among the numerous ferrocene bioconjugates reported, [5] one of the famous examples is the structural variation of the anticancer drug tamoxifen to give ferrocifen. [6, 7] Another one is ferrocerone, which was developed to treat iron deficiency anemias, and used to be marketed in Russia. [8] This minireview focuses mainly on the discovery of ferroquine (FQ, SR97193, Figure 1 ), a new antimalarial, including efforts to understand its mechanism(s) of action and resistance (Table 1 ). Figure 2 ) is a 4-aminoquinoline drug long used in the treatment or prevention of malaria. Although its mechanism of action is only partially understood, its therapeutic effectiveness has been attributed to its ability to preferentially concentrate in the food vacuole of the parasite and to inhibit the formation of malarial pigment (or hemozoin). [9] [10] [11] [12] Resistance to CQ was first reported from Columbia and Thailand in the early 1960s, and is now worldwide. CQ-resistant parasites expel CQ much more rapidly from red blood cells than CQ-sensitive parasites, and many observations indicated that a P. falciparum transmembrane protein (PfCRT) was involved in this efflux.

R is an alkyl or a ferrocenylmethyl group, n varying from 2 to 6. CQ, they offered (relatively) disappointing activities compared to FQ. Compounds such as 6 showed an activity which decreased rapidly with the level of CQ-resistance among the P. falciparum clones tested. Clearly, a cross resistance could be postulated to emerge very quickly. There is no significant correlation between either the liphophilic character or the in vitro inhibition of hemozoin formation and the IC 50 values among CQ analogues 6. [26] Bis-ferrocenyl conjugates (compounds such as 6 with R = Fem) led to erratic activities and it was impossible to measure precise IC 50 values, because of both stability and solubility problems in the culture medium. [26] A decrease of the efficacy was observed between the linear and branched propylamino chain derivatives 8. Introduction of methyl groups in the side chain was not favorable to the antimalarial activity. [26] To the contrary, the presence of the ferrocene moiety within the lateral chain (FQ analogues, 9) is the main condition to retain a strong antimalarial activity on CQresistant P. falciparum. All FQ analogues exhibited an antimalarial activity much stronger than CQ itself on CQ-resistant strains, except when a second ferrocenyl group was introduced on the terminal nitrogen atom. Here again the efficacy of compounds was markedly attenuated. [26] As 1,2-unsymmetrically substituted ferrocenes are chiral molecules, an effort was made to design achiral version of these derivatives. The easiest solution was to move the second substituent to the other cyclopentadienyl cycle. These achiral 1,1'substituted ferrocene analogues 10-11 exhibited lower activity against CQ resistant strains than against the CQ sensitive strains. [27] Nervertheless, no in vivo data were available for the comparison of the substitution patterns: 1,2 versus 1,1'. A similar trend was also observed for the bis-quinoline derivatives 12. [28] Ferrocene conjugates with other antimalarials Artemisinin Ferrocene-derived artemesinins 15-20 did not show better antimalarial activity than that of the parent compound(s). The analogues 15 (obtained as two separable (a and b) C9 stereoisomers) and 16 (racemate) were prepared from artemisitene 14 ( Figure 3 ). [29] These derivatives exhibited IC 50 values on P. falciparum tenfold lower than artemisitene, but similar to that of artemisinin.

As concerns P. falciparum, the products appeared as active on both CQ sensitive and resistant strains, but remained 5-12-fold less active than atovaquone itself on the same strains. [32] Miscellaneous Ferrocenyl sugars were synthesized starting from ellagitanin which has no antimalarial properties per se. [33] Some of the derivatives showed antimalarial activities with IC 50 values in the micromolar, and, rarely, submicromolar range. Another attempt to inhibit P. falciparum hexose transporter (PfHT) expressed in a heterologous system (xenope oocyte) with 3-O-ferrocenyl-dglucose derivatives was performed, but the products failed to show an inhibitory effect upon the transporter. [34] Ferrocenyl chalcones were synthesized and, among them, some compounds had an antimalarial activity in the micromolar range. [35] Interestingly, the incorporation of the ferrocene moiety in the chalcone template was found to enhance its role in processes that involved free radicals. [36] The authors suggested therefore that ferrrocene may participate in redox reaction(s) in relation to their antimalarial activity. [36] More recently, an attempt to improve the reversal properties of strychnobrasiline led to the synthesis of a ferrocene-strychnobrasiline conjugate which showed in vitro a synergy with CQ on a resistant clone, but failed to show the same activity in vivo when tested in association with CQ on the P. yoelii N67 clone in a suppressive four-day test.

Indeed, molecules in the amorphous state generally exhibit greater chemical instability, enhanced dissolution rates, altered mechanical properties, and greater hygroscopicity. Neutral FQ was selected for drug development, as FQ will become (di)protonated when entering the acidic environment of the stomach. Basic FQ crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2 1 /n. [38] In the solid state, FQ is stabilized by a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond between the anilino nitrogen atom and the tertiary nitrogen atom of the side chain ( Figure 1 ). Nevertheless, this H-bond is absent in polar solvents (such as water) or when protonated. This flip/ flop H-bond may help transport of FQ through the hydrophobic membranes. Cationic FQ forms stable dimer structures not only in the solid state but also in solution. [39] This self-association process in water is singularly driven by + -p/ + -p nonbonding interactions.

Over the years, the mechanism of CQ has been the subject of a lot of discussions and arguments. Nevertheless there is strong evidence that the action of CQ is correlated with its localization in the food vacuole of the parasite and with its association with hemozoin. [53] FQ formed a complex with hematin with a stoichiometry of 1 to 1. [54] The free energy of association was estimated to be \u00c07 kcal mol \u00c01 , leading to the conclusion that this noncovalent interaction is weak but favorable. It was also noted that these values are similar to those previously reported for CQ. Moreover, in the presence of FQ, hematin is no longer converted into b-hematin and a dose-dependent inhibition of b-hematin formation was obtained. The IC 50 of FQ was 0.8 equivalents relative to hematin, whereas the IC 50 of CQ was 1.9. This clearly shows that FQ is a strong inhibitor of b-hematin formation, and even more potent than CQ. [54] The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces have been computed at the DFT-B3LYP level of theory for diprotonated FQ and CQ. FQ and CQ show considerable similarity in the quinoline area. As this part of the molecule is thought to interact with hematin by a stacking interaction, a similar mode of interaction between these active drugs (FQ or CQ) and hematin was suggested. [54] To get a better understanding of the contribution of the ferrocene moiety to the antimalarial activity of FQ, we have also estimated some of its physicochemical properties. The apparent partition coefficients (log D) of CQ and FQ were measured at vacuolar (5.2) and cytosolic (7.4) pHs. At cytosolic pH, FQ was more than 100-fold more lipophilic than CQ, whereas the difference in lipophilicity is only slight at vacuolar pH. The pK a values of both drugs allow us to speculate that FQ accumulates at a lower concentration than CQ.
