The main goal of this study was to determine whether the local cell-mediated Gr pathway is activated during severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in children. Tracheal aspirates (TA) from 23 children with RSV-LRTI and 12 controls without pulmonary disease were analyzed for Gr A and B. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from seven children with RSV-LRTI were analyzed for cellular expression of GrB. Levels of GrA and GrB in TA were significantly increased in RSV patients compared with controls and both Grs showed preserved activity. Gr levels correlated with the total leukocyte counts and IL-8 levels in the airways at several time points. However, no correlation between Gr levels and release of caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 was found. There was evidence for marked expression of GrB by both CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells and natural killer cells in the respiratory tract.

The highest GrB expression by NK cells occurred on the first day of admission, before the peak of GrB expression by T cells. Similarly, in RSV infected mice the cytotoxic activity of NK cells is highest before CTLs are recruited to the lungs (16) .

Devadas et al. have shown that T H 2 cells express GrB which induces their own cell death (37) . Furthermore, they reported that GrB deficient mice have augmented T H 2 cytokine responses and lung cellular infiltrations in a model of allergic inflammation. Grossman et al. have shown that the Gr pathway is exploited by natural T-regulatory cells (CD4 \u03e9 CD25 \u03e9 ) against autologous activated CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells (38) . These findings suggest that Grs function to control immune responses, in addition to their role in direct virus-infected cell killing. In contrast, another line of research proposes that Grs actively participate in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses. For example, studies in vitro have shown that proteolytic active GrA induces the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts (13) . In the present study, Gr levels significantly correlated with IL-8 levels in the airways during severe RSV-LRTI and with total WBC counts after the acute phase of respiratory failure.
