            "text": "We have previously used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. 7 In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days indicate an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reported 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of Feb 29, 2020. 2 Since initial submission of this letter, aggressive case finding efforts combined with ongoing epidemic growth have resulted in a dramatic increase in reported cases in Italy, which as of March 12, 2020, stand at 15 113. 8 ART and DF report grants from Canadian Institutes for Health Research.

We used the methods of Fraser and collegues 3 to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travellers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) 4 and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3\u00b74 days), 5 and assumed the Italian epidemic began 1 month preceding Feb 29, 2020. 6 We also did sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-19, and excluded cases in bordering countries or which were ",
