The use of serum pancreatic enzyme elevations to delineate the presence or degree of pancreatic injury is not validated or recommended, for example, in asymptomatic patients for monitoring of checkpoint inhibitor induced pancreatic toxicity 3 or for determining the degree of pancreatic injury in trauma patients 4 .",

Therefore, any potential clinical merits of this study lie primarily in those five patients (cases 1, 4, 5, 8 and 9) with elevated lipase levels. However, lipase can be elevated without obvious major clinical sequelae for a variety of reasons not related to direct cytotoxic effects of SARS-CoV-2 including ICU critical illness (case 4), diabetes (cases 1 and 5), and opioid use (not detailed) [5] [6] [7] . Of the five cases of mildly elevated lipase, only two (cases 8 and 9) do not have obvious alternative explanations as delineated above, and the lipases in those cases are 85 and 77 U/L [upper limit of normal (ULN) was 70 U/L], respectively. This could be within the margin of error for the laboratory assay. Our own laboratory, for example, has a serum lipase ULN of 63 U/L with a 10% margin of error (personal communication); therefore, the application of this margin of error to case 9 would bring their lipase into the normal range. We would also point out that seven of the nine patients received corticosteroids (cases 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) which has been associated with elevated lipase levels 8 .",
