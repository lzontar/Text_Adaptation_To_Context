Herein, we report that the clinical approved auranofin could perfectly inhibit the activity of 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Gold cluster could significantly inhibit 3CLpro of SARS-COV-2. Phenyl isothiocyanate and Vitamin K3 could well suppress the activity of 3CLpro. For Mpro inhibition, IC50 of auranofin, Vitamin K3, phenyl isothiocyanate, gold cluster are about 0.51\u00b5M, 7.96\u00b5M, 10.13\u00b5M, 1.61\u00b5M, respectively. These compounds may be with potentials for treatment SARS-CoV-2 virus replication. Especially for FDA approved auranofin, it is an anti-inflammation drug in clinic, thus it may with strong potential to inhibit virus replication and suppress the inflammation damage in COVID-19 patients. Gold cluster is with better safety index and well anti-inflammation in vitro/vivo, therefore it is with potential to inhibit virus replication and suppress the inflammation damage caused by COVID-19 virus. As Au(I) ion is active metabolism specie derived from gold compounds or gold clusters in vivo, further computational studies revealed Au ion could tightly bind thiol group of Cys145 residue of 3CLpro thus inhibit enzyme activity. Also, phenyl isothiocyanate and Vitamin K3 may interact with thiol group of Cys145 via Michael addition reaction, molecular dynamic (MD) theory studied are applied to confirmed these small molecules are stable in the pocket and inhibit Mpro activity.",

The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro, also called Mpro) enzyme controls this COVID-19 virus replication and is essential for its life cycle. Therefore, 3CLpro is drug target in the case of SARS-CoV-2. Our biochemistry studied revealed that the gold compounds such as auranofin, Isothiocyanate compounds such as phenyl isothiocyanate, vitamin K such as vitamin K3, and gold cluster such as glutathione coated gold cluster could well inhibit the activity of 3CLpro. Further DFT and MD computational studies also verified these small molecules could interact Cys145 and amino acid residues of Mpro, thus suppress the activity of Mpro. These compounds could serve as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 lead molecules for further drug studies to combat COVID-19.",

Molecules picked from gold compounds library, gold cluster library (gold atoms stack together to form cluster and the cluster is stabled by organic molecule with thiol group, where thiol groups interact with gold cluster via Au-S bond), Isothiocyanate library, and vitamin K library were used. When the different compounds were added into the enzymatic reaction solution, the change of initial rates was calculated to evaluate their inhibitory effect. The molecule inhibit Mpro activity reaction mixture included 0.5 \u03bcM protein, 20 \u03bcM substrate (EDNAS-Glu)-Ser-Ala-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Ala-(Lys-DABCYL)-Ser) and molecules from afore mentioned compound library. The compounds of interest were defined as those with a percentage of inhibition over 50% compared with the reaction in the absence of inhibitor. IC50 values of four compounds were measured using 0.5 \u03bcM protein, 20 \u03bcM substrate and 9 different inhibitor concentrations of compounds.

This is a very strong suppressor for Mpro. This result is a strong proof to well understand why auranofin could well inhibit virus replication(3). The auranofin was approved by FDA in clinical treatment Rheumatoid Arthritis treatments via suppress the immune cytokine activity(4). As COVID-19 virus could cause immune cytokine storm in patients, recent reports revealed drugs inhibit immune cytokine activity could well recover severe patients(5).

(a) Binding pocket consisting of amino acids Cys-145 and His-41. (b) The stable interaction configuration between Au+ and the amino acids. Hydrogen atoms in b are not shown for clarity. The interaction between gold atom with the binding pocket of proteins SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6Y2E) was studied by DFT calculations. The binding pocket consisted mainly of a cysteine and the thiol sulfur atom of Cys145 and the imidazole nitrogen atom of His41. The Au atom had a valence of +1 because of the formation of the Au-S bond. The histidine N atom donated its electron lone pair to the vacant orbital of Au, which did not change the valance of Au. The binding energy was as high as 90.5 kcal mol\u22121. This suggested that Au+ ion firmly locked the cysteine and histidine groups together, which might hinder the bioactivity of the protein. For molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, the systems were constructed by SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6Y2E) complex with phenyl isothiocyanate or Vitamin K3. The stability of the system was obtained by MD simulation using Nanoscale MD (NAMD)software(18). These input files were generated by CHARMM-GUI(19). All the systems were solvated using the TIP3 water model and neutralized with NaCl to an ionic concentration of 0.15 M. The following simulation protocols were applied for each system: 10 ps minimization by steepest descent method; 5 ns equilibration in standard number of particle, volume and temperature (NVT) ensemble; followed by unrestrained 50 ns production MD simulations in standard number of particle, pressure and temperature (NPT) ensemble, at time step and collection interval of2 fs and 1 ps, respectively. The stability of the systems was examined by computing the backbone root mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of the entire trajectories. Once the phenyl isothiocyanate interact with thiol group of Cys145 in the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6Y2E), this small molecule may further interact with close amino acid residues. MD result, Figure 6, showed the binding pocket consisted mainly of His-41, His-164, and Met-165. Phenyl isothiocyanate forms hydrogen bond interaction with His-41 and His-164, as hydrogen atom donor. In addition, the structure of phenyl isothiocyanate was very consistent with the structure of the Mpro pocket.",
