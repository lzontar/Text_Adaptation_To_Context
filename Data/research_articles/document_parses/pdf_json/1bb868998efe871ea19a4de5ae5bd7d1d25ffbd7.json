Since then, a large number of human COVID-19 cases have been reported around the world, becoming a global pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Experimental data has confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can use angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor (2) . Furthermore, animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have shown that ferrets and cats are susceptible to infection (5) , implying that companion animals might be infected after contact with individuals carrying COVID-19. In this study, we collected swab and blood samples from pet cats and dogs in Wuhan whose owners were confirmed to have COVID-19. Our results provide serological evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection in pets.",

Serological data suggests that three pets (two cats, one dog) had been exposed to the virus, although viral RNA detection was negative. Prior to our study, a preprint of a research article posted online at bioRxiv indicated that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in cats in Wuhan at the time of the COVID-19 epidemic (7) . In addition, pet dogs and cats in Hong Kong (8), whose owners had been diagnosed with COVID-19, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Collectively, these results indicate the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to companion animals, possible through contact with owners carrying COVID-19. However, we were not able to determine whether, under natural conditions, pet cats and dogs can be readily infected with or transmit SARS-CoV-2. Further studies will be needed to establish the role of pets in the current COVID-19 epidemic.",

The mean ages of enrolled cats and dogs were 1.83 years (range: 0.4 to 4.6 years, median 1.7 years) and 3.07 years (range: 0.9 to 7.4 years, median 2.3 years), respectively. All cats and dogs were physically normal when sampled. Swab samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), with primers and probes targeting the nucleocapsid protein (N) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes of SARS-CoV-2. All pet samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for both N andRdRp genes. The internal reference gene GADPH was amplified in all samples (data not shown). Titres of SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG in plasma were determined with double antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described previously(6). Two cats (cat 8 and 18) and one dog (dog 4) were strongly positive and showed high ELISA optical density (OD) ratios for IgG (Figure 1A). Positive plasma samples were further analysed with neutralising titres using the plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) for SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with IgG titres, cat 8, cat 18, and dog 4 showed neutralising titres of 1:240, 1:240 and 1:120, respectively (Figure 1B). Several other pet plasma samples were tested in parallel and showed titres of less than 1:20 (data not shown). The serological data indicates that some of the pets had been infected with SARS-CoV-2.",
