To stop the spread, rapid testing is required at community clinics and hospitals. These rapid tests should be comparable with the standard PCR technology. Isothermal amplification technology provides an excellent alternative that is highly amenable to resource limited settings, where expertise and infrastructure to support PCR are not available. In this review, we provide a brief description of isothermal amplification technology, its potential and the gaps that need to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Among this emerging technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Nicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR) technologies have been identified as potential platforms that could be implemented at community level, without samples referral to a centralized laboratory and prolonged turnaround time associated with the standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test. LAMP, for example, has recently been shown to be comparable with PCR and could be performed in less than 30 min by non-laboratory staff, without RNA extractions commonly associated with PCR. Interestingly, NEAR (ID NOW\u2122 COVID-19 (Abbott, IL, USA) was able to detect the virus in 5 min. More so, isothermal platforms are cost effective and could easily be scaled up to resource limited settings.

This means that frontline workers like nurses and medical doctors can perform COVID-19 test when needed at point of care. The IAT technologies offer high sensitivity and specificity when compared with PCR [29] [30] [31] , mainly due to the strand displacement enzymes that are commonly used in these technologies. For example, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) and NEAR, uses Bacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase, while DNA polymerase from Bacillus subtilis is used by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). Their polymerase activity was noted for improved sensitivity and efficiency. Additionally, the use of IAT is less expensive or comparable with PCR-based test.

Schematic representation of loop-mediated amplification reaction and its principle. Unlike PCR primer design, LAMP is characterized with four different primers, specifically designed to recognize six distinct regions of the target DNA. Forward inner primer (FIP) consists of a F2 region at the 3'-end and an F1c region at the 5'-end.

The Backward Inner primer (BIP) is made up of a B2 region at the 3'-end and a B1c region at the 5'-end. B3 primer (backward outer primer) consists of a B3 region which is complementary to the B3c region of the template sequence. In regards to LAMP reaction, amplification begins when F2 region of FIP anneals to F2c region of the target DNA and initiates complementary strand synthesis, and F3 primer anneals to the F3c region of the target and extends, displacing the FIP linked complementary strand. This displaced strand forms a loop at the 5'-end, which provides the template for BIP, and B2 anneals to B2c region of the template. DNA synthesis is initiated, which results in the formation of a complementary strand and opening of the 5'-end loop. Subsequently, B3 anneals to B3c region of the target DNA and extends, displacing the BIP linked complementary strand, which forms a dumbbellshaped DNA. The nucleotides are added to the 3'-end of F1 by Bst DNA polymerase, which extends and opens up the loop at the 5'-end.

Schematic representation of loop-mediated amplification reaction and its principle.

B3 primer (backward outer primer) consists of a B3 region which is complementary to the B3c region of the template sequence. In regards to LAMP reaction, amplification begins when F2 region of FIP anneals to F2c region of the target DNA and initiates complementary strand synthesis, and F3 primer anneals to the F3c region of the target and extends, displacing the FIP linked complementary strand. This displaced strand forms a loop at the 5'-end, which provides the template for BIP, and B2 anneals to B2c region of the template. DNA synthesis is initiated, which results in the formation of a complementary strand and opening of the 5'-end loop. Subsequently, B3 anneals to B3c region of the target DNA and extends, displacing the BIP linked complementary strand, which forms a dumbbellshaped DNA. The nucleotides are added to the 3'-end of F1 by Bst DNA polymerase, which extends and opens up the loop at the 5'-end.
