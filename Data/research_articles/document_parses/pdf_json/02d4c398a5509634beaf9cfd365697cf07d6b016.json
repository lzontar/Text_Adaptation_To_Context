            "text": "A 58-year woman living on Wangji Street, Xinzhou District, Wuhan City (China) had a history of close contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19. Since 25 January 2020, she had experienced a fever (38\u00b0C), a cough with production of thick white sputum and chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, and a poor appetite; however, she had no dyspnea, hemoptysis, or vomiting. On 31 January, she underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) scan at the Xinzhou People's Hospital (Wuhan, China), which showed bilateral patchy lung shadows (Fig. 1) . Additionally, a nucleic acid test performed on a throat swab specimen showed a positive result (the throat swab specimen was sent to Wuhan Huada Medical Laboratory (Wuhan, China) for testing in a biosafety transport box; sampling code 20S6721844). She was diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to our hospital (Xinzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital) on 1 February 2020. Upon admission, laboratory examination showed a platelet count of 402 \u00d7 10 9 /L (reference range, 100-300 \u00d7 10 9 /L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 34 mm/h (0-15 mm/h), uric acid concentration of 414.50 \u00b5mol/L (142-339 \u00b5mol/L), procalcitonin concentration of <0.02 (0.00-0.05 ng/mL), alanine aminotransferase concentration of 15 U/L (0-38 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase concentration of 18.2 U/L (0-38 U/L), total protein concentration of 57.9 g/L (62-85 g/L), and globulin concentration of 21.2 g/L (25-45 g/L). The patient's husband had died of COVID-19 on 26 January 2020. Her daughter had developed COVID-19 while caring for her and her husband but subsequently recovered. The patient lived together with her son, daughter-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter; none of them had symptoms such as cough or fever, and their nucleic acid tests showed negative results. She had undergone thyroid cancer resection in February 2018 and had since taken levothyroxine tablets intermittently. After admission to our hospital, the patient was treated with integrative traditional Chinese and Western medicine for the first 5 days; she was mainly treated with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) thereafter. Based on her symptoms, including fever, cough, white sticky sputum, chest pain, fatigue, dry and bitter mouth with the desire for hot drinks, and dark red tongue with a thin, yellow, and greasy coating (her pulse was not evaluated because of the need to wear multiple layers of gloves), she was diagnosed with deficiency of qi and yin and dampness and phlegm obstructed in the middle. Thus, she was prescribed: Dang Shen (Codonopsis pilosula (Franch.) Nannf.) 15 g, Xing Ren (Prunus armeniaca L. var ansu Maxim.) 9 g, Su Zi (Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt.) 9 g, Yu Zhu (Polygonatum odoratum (Mill.) Druce) 9 g, Tian Hua Fen (Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim.) 9 g, Bai He (Lilium lancifolium Thunb.) 15 g, Chen Pi (Citrus reticulata Blanco) 9 g, Qing Ban Xia (Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Breit.) 9 g, Huang Lian (Coptis chinensis Franch.) 3 g, Huang Qin Chen) 6 g, and Wu Wei Zi (Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill.) 9 g. These ingredients were boiled in water to 400 mL and taken after a meal each morning and evening throughout the whole hospitalization. Additionally, she took Lianhua Qingwen capsules (two capsules three times a day after meals for 4 days), Bailing capsules (four capsules three times a day after meals throughout the whole hospitalization), and oseltamivir phosphate tablets (75 mg twice daily for 5 days).",

On 11 and 13 February, she underwent two nucleic acid tests by throat swabs and obtained negative results for both. A blood analysis on 13 February showed a white blood cell count of 5.58 \u00d7 10 9 /L, red blood cell count of 3.88 \u00d7 10 12 /L, hemoglobin concentration of 117.00 g/L, lymphocyte absolute count of 1.67 \u00d7 10 9 /L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10 mm/h. Having reached the discharge standards set by the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 (Trial version 5), 5 the patient was discharged from our hospital on 15 February and was required to be quarantined at home for 2 weeks, separated with her son, who was also at home.

Therefore, throughout the entire respiratory tract with the exception of the lungs, coronavirus accumulates primarily in the throat; this is why many patients with COVID-19 in clinical practice have been found to have coughs caused by throat itching. However, a simple chest radiograph or throat swab nucleic acid test is not enough to determine whether the virus has been completely removed. The throat swab test results cannot truly reflect the amount of virus present in the throat and the lungs. During treatment, the virus may be controlled and significantly reduced or removed from the upper respiratory tract; however, this does not mean that the virus in the lower respiratory tract has also been completely removed, but only that it cannot be detected through throat swab tests. Similarly, the coronavirus may affect the heart, liver, spleen, and kidney. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] If underlying diseases affecting any of these five viscera are present, virus removal will be more difficult.",

The virus might have been controlled at a low level, making it difficult to collect from the throat. Before the protective antibodies were produced, the discontinuation of treatment may have contributed to a comeback of the virus. The positive result of the nucleic acid test on the throat swab on 8 March basically ruled out the false-positive result, as assisted by the results of two nucleic acid tests from throat swabs on 17 and 20 March and viral antibody tests on 17 March ( Table 1) . Instead of resurgence, the virus was in fact still present. According to the explanation of positive test results in recovered patients with COVID-19 by academician Lanjuan Li in an interview, a small amount of residual virus remained in the deep regions of the lung, suggesting that TCM care such as Chinese herbal decoction, acupuncture and moxibustion, and Chinese Tuina massage during the rehabilitation period is also important. Our patient was first discharged from the hospital according to the discharge standards at that time; these standards were based on consecutive negative nucleic acid test results together with remarkable alleviation of respiratory symptoms, a decrease in body temperature, and improvement of chest CT results. The throat swab test is convenient and therefore very common. However, an anal test and virus antibody test should be considered in future because such tests may help to rule out positive cases among discharged patients. In particular, if IgM is negative and IgG is positive in a discharged patient with COVID-19, then protective antibodies have been produced and centralized isolation is not needed; this may greatly reduce medical costs.",
