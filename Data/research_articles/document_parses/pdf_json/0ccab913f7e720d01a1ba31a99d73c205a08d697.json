Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Ben Taub General Hospital (BTGH), Houston, Texas, and King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH), Mumbai, India. Patients: Women admitted during pregnancy or 6 weeks postpartum between 1992 and 2001. Measurements and results: Patients from BTGH (n=174) and KEMH (n=754) had comparable age, number of organs affected, incidence of medical disorders (30%), liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. Fewer KEMH patients received prenatal care (27 vs 86%) and came to hospital within 24 h of onset of symptoms (60 vs 90%). They had higher APACHE II scores (median 16 vs 10), greater incidence of neurological (63 vs 36%), renal (50 vs 37%), and cardiovascular dysfunction (39 vs 29%). Severe malaria, viral hepatitis, cerebral venous thrombosis, and poisoning were common medical disorders. The BTGH group had higher incidence of respiratory dys-function (59 vs 46%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (40 vs 23%), placental anomalies, HELLP syndrome, chorioamnionitis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, puerperal sepsis, urinary infection, bacteremia, substance abuse, and asthma. More BTGH patients required mechanical ventilation and blood component therapy, whereas more KEMH patients needed dialysis. Of BTGH patients, 78.2% were delivered by cesarean section (vs 15.4%). Maternal (2.3 vs 25%) and fetal (13 vs 51%) mortality were lower in BTGH patients. Conclusions: There were marked differences in medical diseases, organ failure, and intensive care needs.

Severe sepsis due to complicated urinary infection occurred in 10.3% of American patients. Urinary tract infections are more common and also more severe in pregnancy because of vesicoureteric reflux due to pressure on the urinary bladder by the gravid uterus and dilatation of the ureters secondary to the effect of progesterone [18] ; however, complicated urinary tract infection was rare in Indian patients (0.3%). Sexual inter- course has been shown to increase risk of urinary infection five to tenfold and is implicated as the most important factor in the pathogenesis of urinary infection in young women [19] . Indian women traditionally stay with their mothers during the latter half of pregnancy, away from their husbands. The resulting abstinence from sexual intercourse could explain the lower incidence of urosepsis in the Indian patients. This can also explain why 12.6% of BTGH patients had sepsis due to chorioamnionitis compared with 0.9% of KEMH patients. Sexual intercourse is also an important cause of bacterial vaginosis and premature rupture of membranes, both of which are risk factors for chorioamnionitis [20] . Severe malaria accounted for nearly 10% of all admissions in the Indian ICU. In women residing in areas where falciparum malaria is endemic, the normal change of the immune response to a predominant TH 2 type during pregnancy results in loss of acquired immunity against Plasmodium falciparum [21] ; hence, malaria tends to be more severe in pregnant women and mortality may be as high as 25% [22] . Acute viral hepatitis, especially due to water-borne hepatitis A and E viruses, is common in India [23, 24] . Hepatitis A is responsible for 1.5% of viral hepatitis in pregnant patients, whereas hepatitis E infection accounts for 60-75% of cases [23, 24, 25] . Pregnant women are more susceptible to hepatitis E virus infection and are also more likely to develop fulminant hepatic failure as compared with non-pregnant women [23, 24] .

Only 27% of Indian women (vs 86% of American women) had attended prenatal clinics; mortality in patients who received regular prenatal care was significantly lower than patients who had not. While non-availability of health care services may be an important issue in rural India, this is definitely not the case in Mumbai. Free prenatal services are available at state-funded centers, but long queues and wait times limit their use. Private health care is expensive and cost of regular prenatal visits is prohibitive [4, 31] . Some patients do not seek medical attention during pregnancy because of social misconceptions and up to 40% of deliveries in rural India take place at home, unsupervised by medical personnel [31] . The high number of Indian women with pre-eclampsia manifesting with seizures is a clear reflection of their non-utilization of prenatal care services, as is the interval between onset of acute illness and hospital admission.

In many obstetric disorders including severe pre-eclampsia, prolonged intra-uterine fetal death and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, early delivery can be lifesaving by preventing complications such as seizures, DIC, hepatic encephalopathy, and renal failure [32, 33] . Removing the fetus from the compromised uterine environment also improves fetal outcome [32, 33] . Neonatology services are restricted to only a handful of centers in India, even in large cities. Given the likelihood of poor fetal survival if delivered prematurely, pregnant women and their families decline early elective delivery at a stage when the illness can be managed in primary or secondary care centers. It is therefore not surprising that induction of labor was performed in only 26.7% of Indian women (vs 38% in BTGH patients) and cesarean section in 16% (vs 78% in BTGH patients). This aggressive obstetric approach and better neonatology facilities may have accounted for the low maternal and fetal mortality in the BTGH patients; however, surgical intervention in patients with shock, severe organ dysfunction, and coagulopathy increase the risk of complications, especially hemorrhage and postoperative abdominal and pelvic sepsis [34] . This explains the greater need for transfusion of packed red cells and blood products and higher incidence of puerperal sepsis in BTGH patients.

Attention to many of these issues is needed to reduce maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity in developing countries such as India.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Critical illness in pregnancy: analysis of 20 patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Collop", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Sahn", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1993, "venue": "Chest", "volume": "103", "issn": "", "pages": "1545--1552", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Critical care management of the obstetric patient", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Lapinsky", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Kruczynski", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Seaward", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Farne", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Grossman", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1997, "venue": "Can J Anaesth", "volume": "44", "issn": "", "pages": "325--329", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, organ failure and outcome in critically ill obstetric patients treated in an ICU", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Afessa", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Green", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Delke", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Koch", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2001, "venue": "Chest", "volume": "120", "issn": "", "pages": "1271--1277", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Maternal mortality: global similarities and differences", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Maine", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Chavkin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "J Am Med Womens Assoc", "volume": "57", "issn": "", "pages": "127--130", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Intensive care unit morbidity and mortality from eclampsia: an evaluation of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and the Glasgow Coma Scale score", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Bhagwanjee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Paruk", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Moodley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Djj", "middle": [], "last": "Muckart", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "Crit Care Med", "volume": "28", "issn": "", "pages": "120--124", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Intensive care for critically ill obstetric patients", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Tripathi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Rathore", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Saran", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "Int J Gynecol Obstet", "volume": "68", "issn": "", "pages": "257--258", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Transfer of obstetric patients to an intensive care unit: an eighty-two case report in Burkina Faso", "authors": [{"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Dao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Rouamba", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Ouedraogo", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Kambou", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Bazie", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Gynecol Obstet Fertil", "volume": "31", "issn": "", "pages": "123--126", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Near-miss maternal mortality in developing countries", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["P"], "last": "Dias De Souza", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Duarte", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Basile-Filho", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol", "volume": "104", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "The world health report 2002.
