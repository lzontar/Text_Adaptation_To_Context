Through studying the literature, interpreting official documents, analyzing medical and social management data, we summarized and compared some powerful measures taken by the Chinese government, such as declaring emergency state, blocking down the epidemic center, prohibiting crowd gathering activities, forcing residents to wear masks, and mobilizing medical staff and products. We found that these unconventional measures, on the one hand, controlled the spread of the epidemic in China, and on the other hand, exposed some of China's shortcomings in biosafety, food safety, public health input, and emergency system construction. This paper also recommends that other countries should take strict isolation measures as early as possible when fighting COVID-19 epidemics, and also mobilize citizens to strengthen self-protection.",

The earliest case was on December 8, 2019. 1 Later, some research institutions predicted that the pneumonia perhaps caused by a new virus. 2 During this period, due to the Spring Festival holiday and other factors, there had been a large-scale and nationwide population flow, there were also a large number of commercial and cultural activities in China, and the spread of the virus was amazing. On January 20, 2020, Chinese National Health Commission organized a high-level expert panel to visit Wuhan. The panel confirmed that it was a serious respiratory infectious disease, with the patient size and infectious power no less than that of SARS. 3 World Health Organization also issued warning. 4 So far, the COVID-19 pneumonia was fully exposed. Then, the epidemic had spread to all provinces in Mainland China and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, at least 84,385 Chinese people had been diagnosed and 4643 had died, and it was difficult to estimate the number of asymptomatic patients accurately. 5 Relying on the government's coercive disease control and the cooperation of residents, China's epidemic had been quickly alleviated. In this paper, we would describe and evaluate these emergency measures, and discuss how one can promote these measures upgrading to optimization measures that should be more in line with the requirements of the rule of law and the public health.",

Until January 9, 2020, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced for the first time that the pathogen was preliminarily determined as a new type of coronavirus. 10 The Second Factor Has Underestimated the Infection Risk of COVID-19 Pneumonia Wuhan Municipal Government was not failing to take control measures, but the selected measures were not thorough. The government only decided to close the seafood market where patients were first identified, but they did not keep isolation measures to close contacts. Wuhan Health Department ordered infectious disease specialist hospitals to treat such patients, but the number of ward and equipment of these special hospitals was not enough. The government recommended that citizens with symptoms of cough and fever wear masks when going out, but there was no restriction on their movement, nor the ability to conduct a comprehensive virus detection on them. 11 With the passage of time, the risk of out-of-control conditions had increased significantly from January to March, 2020 ( Figure 1 ).",

It should be admitted that with the support of these measures and the tenacious efforts of medical staff, China had rapidly treated more than 80,000 patients. The number of new cases per day in China had begun to decline steadily, the number of cure cases were growing, the virus did not break out in other big cities in China outside Wuhan (Figures 2 and 3) .

The design principles of isolation mechanism were: first of all, assuming that Wuhan was the only focus of the epidemic, cut off the flow of people in Wuhan could prevent the virus from being brought to other places and abroad. Secondly, the existing population in Wuhan might be divided into healthy people, suspected infected people and infected people. For healthy people, if they did not go out and took protective measures at home, they will not have access to the infected people and can avoid infection. For those suspected of infection, the general incubation period is 3-15 days. They should be isolated and observed at home. If they got sick, they should go to the hospital. If they did not get sick, they would be out of the risk of infection. For the infected people, local government would try to get them all treated. Although this kind of largescale isolation measure was very chaotic at the beginning, the Chinese government still insisted on carrying out it and achieved the desired effect.",

They consciously put on masks and reduced going out. On the other hand, the Chinese government used policemen, civil servants and community managers to inspect public places, monitor traffic, and force work stoppages. People had no place to go, so they can only reduce social activities according to government requirements. Ancient Roman author Phaedrus once wrote \"If you draw the bowsrting too tight, your bow will soon break\". During the COVID-19 epidemic, China also had paid great cost for these unconventional measures. Industry, commerce and transportation had been suspended for up to 3 months. It was expected that a number of SME enterprises would bankrupt and many people would lose their jobs, direct economic losses and long-term impacts were difficult to estimate. Some hospitals were forced to stop due to epidemic, making residents with ordinary diseases very passive. More than 3000 medical staff were infected at work, and at least 14 medical staff died. 30 Due to insufficient detection capacity at the beginning of the outbreak, and the diagnosis criteria established by the Chinese National Health Commission did not consider patients with positive nucleic acid tests but no fever, so the number of asymptomatic infections in China were still difficult to estimate.",

In recent years, China had revised \"Food Safety Law\", which provided for more severe penalties, but there was a gap between legislation and real life. First, China had a large population base, increasing consumer demand, and the Chinese government strictly controlled the price of food. In order to reduce costs, some animal and plant breeders tried to increase the breeding density, shorten the breeding time, and even abuse the growth hormones and antibiotics, make food unsafe. Secondly, according to Article 34 of the \"Food Safety Law\", any meat product that failed to be quarantined or failed to pass the quarantine inspection or failed to pass the inspection shall be banned from sale, but this did not cover completely. Law enforcement agencies mainly inspected shopping malls and supermarkets, while a large number of food in the retail market and wholesale market, unpacked food and non-standard food were difficult to supervise, the COVID-19 outbreak happened just in the traditional market. Thirdly, the COVID-19 pneumonia was highly suspected to be related to the wild animals. As for edible wild animals, China had some bad traditions, which were even regarded as a kind of pride by some affluent social classes. For this reason, a huge illegal animal sales chain had been formed and hard to get rid of it. Fourth, the food safety regulatory force was weak in the face of the crisis. Before 2018, China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) was also responsible for the supervision of food and drugs. After 2018, CFDA was changed into the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), which gave the authority of food supervision to the State Administration for Market Regulation, that may cause a regulatory gap. Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs was in charge of protecting and supervising wild animals, but they mainly focused on the capture, breeding and other links, less focusing market trading activities. According to the \"Food Safety Law\", the Chinese government had set up the National Food Safety Committee, but this Committee still needed more powerful measures when implementing cross-sector issues involving various links of the food industry chain, such as food safety risk assessment and food source traceability system.",

Wuhan was an urban area with more people and less land, with a population density of 1284.42 people/km 2 . The COVID-19 pneumonia broke out in Jianghan District, the old urban area of Wuhan, with a population density of 13,892 people/km 2 . In 2019, Wuhan's gross domestic product (GNP) reached 160 million yuan, accounting for more than one-third of Hubei Province. 31 As a super city, Wuhan had great pressure on air quality, urban water use, pollution discharge, epidemic prevention, etc., especially in the old urban areas, it was also faced with problems such as land use progress, living space relief, public facilities supporting renewal, etc. In the early stage, the Chinese government proposed to control the scale of large cities, and improving the level of public health services in cities, however the realization of these ideas also required more precise planning and sufficient investment.",

People still liked to go to large hospitals and find high-level doctors-even very small common diseases. There were two tendencies in large hospitals. One was that the investment in cardiovascular, tumor and other departments were very large, which was related to the rapid rise in the incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and tumor after China's rapid prosperity. The equipment of these departments were very advanced, while the development of respiratory and infectious diseases departments was slow, because the per capita medical cost of such patients was not high. Another trend was that doctors in hospitals need to undertake not only diagnosing and treating, but also scientific research work. A large number of doctors spent a lot of energy on research and statistics cases and publish medical papers for income and promotion. As commented by foreign organizations, the Chinese medical community were impatient with the continuous research on the virus. After the SARS in 2003, the research on the virus had no longer be carried out. Some Chinese doctors' papers published in international academic journals had also been largely withdrawn due to the problem of academic integrity.",

After 2003, in order to solve the problem of the weak and low level of infectious diseases departments in hospitals, the Chinese government decided to expand disease control and prevention center, to manage the infectious diseases in a unified way, and required that the confirmation, information release, diagnosis and treatment specifications, scientific research of all infectious diseases should be undertaken by the center. In the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and some Provinces' Branch Centers, the research teams and research capabilities were very strong, but the medical strength was relatively weak in the cites and counties branch centers, they had not enough doctors and wards to treat patients, usually, they mainly focused on vaccine distribution, infectious disease quantity report, etc. This kind of system cannot achieve onestop reception and treatment, which would definitely affect the efficiency of the rapid epidemic. The second problem came from hospitals management system. With the development of China's health reform, some hospitals had been transformed into affiliated hospitals of universities, which were managed by universities instead of local health departments. This caused two predicament: Firstly, when patients increased, alternative options were to vacate wards or even changed the whole hospital into an isolation center, but this needed to be negotiated by the three parties of university, hospital and health department. Secondly, in the allocation of medical materials urgently needed for the infectious diseases, the health departments of local governments would first consider the needs of hospitals under their direct management, and then other types of hospitals. After the outbreak of the epidemic, some hospitals cannot apply for medical materials from their superiors in time, so they can only choose social and enterprise assistance. As a result, the public opinion criticized the emergency materials reserve of the government.",

However, if the foundation of the public health system was not strong enough, this set of unconventional measures cannot be used for a long time. The optimal choice was that when similar epidemic came, instead of hasty decision-making, a clear legal framework should be established, more mature legal rules such as law on prevention of infectious diseases, law on food and drug safety, law on emergency state and law on promotion of public health should be established to solve the problem, transparency and technological level should be increased, too.",
