The smart concept devices including electric automobiles, smart homes and cities, and the Internet of Things (IoT) promise further integration but as the hardware, software, and network infrastructure becomes more integrated they also become more susceptible to cyber attacks or exploitation. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)'s Big Data Platform (BDP), deep analytics, and unsupervised machine learning (ML) have the potential to address resource management, cybersecurity, and energy network situation awareness. In this paper, we demonstrate their potential using the Pecan Street data. We also show an unsupervised ML such as lexical link analysis (LLA) as a causal learning tool to discover the causes for anomalous behavior related to energy use and cybersecurity.",

            "text": "1. Threats typical to smart grids and IoT devices are that they are not only vulnerable to physical faults and attacks but to cyber attacks as in the Internet, since the rise of the Internet and the integration via the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI) allows an integration of standards throughout the different types of networks and devices Threats and vulnerabilities therefore are similar. The energy assets would naturally be susceptible to cyber attacks such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS), worms, viruses and similar cyber exploits which might be the reasons for the Ukrainian power grid problems [16] and the Massachusetts gas explosions [18] . An attacker could take control of the company's \"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\" (SCADA) distribution management system [16] . The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) notes that the rise of electric vehicles and smart devices has as one obstacle which is the cybersecurity [17] . Correlations between different categories of sensor big data could potentially act as \"red flags\" or early-warning signs of the cyber breach and vulnerability. 2. Distribution automation (DA) is a concept of smart grid which focuses on the operation and system reliability at the distribution level. The conventional centralized control management strategy is less effective for the smart grid due to the unidirectional power flow and requirement of control of a distributed grid. It is imperative to predict hotspots and areas of greatest concern which will lead to a reduction in waste and inefficiency or expose security vulnerabilities. This also calls for big data and deep analytics to be operated in a distributed fashion. 3. Risks include unanticipated operational conditions, for example, for a gridconnected microgrid, severe weather conditions or grid blackouts may trigger an unintentional islanding accident [2] , which threats the safety operation and causes technical challenges.",

BDP uses a catalogue or taxonomy shared by multiple users in the same domain. For example, in a typical cybersecurity environment, people often use similar network monitoring tools to collect data and monitor activities, therefore, the data fields are similar and can be shared across multiple locations. The characteristic applies to the energy grid as well. This is an unique advantage of using BDP. Figure 4 shows the average electricity usage each hour over one month for the Pecan Street data set. It is interesting to note that the spikes in use are not regular. Figure 5 shows a dashboard of graphs and metrics representing electricity usage over 24 h for different areas of the data set.

Human analysts need to validate and understand if the associations make sense and what are the real causes and effects. In a real-life application, one often wants to predict causes based on the data of effects, i.e., computing and validating the probability (P) of a potential cause (C) given an effect (E), i.e., P (C|E). Effects are often observable data, e.g., grid mt 1.8 in the Pecan Street data set. Causes, e.g., specific users and time points need to be discovered from the observable data. P (C|E) is difficult to discover because causes are often hidden, anomalous, and capricious. In machine learning practices, the associations, correlations or probabilistic rules are typically cross-validated using separate or new data sets. Causal learning requires the intervention and counterfactual reasoning. An intervention reasoning tries to answer the question: What will happen if one takes an action? For example, instead of examining P (C|E), if E is actionable or P (C|do(E)) [23] can be examined. The intervention more than just mining the existing data.",

We also demonstrated unsupervised learning algorithms to discover the usage patterns and anomalies. We also defined an anomaly index and showed its values for the clusters and time points. We showed LLA as an innovative approach to discover causal associations. The information can help business users to see the patterns and detect abnormal activities for the management and cybersecurity of an energy grid.",
