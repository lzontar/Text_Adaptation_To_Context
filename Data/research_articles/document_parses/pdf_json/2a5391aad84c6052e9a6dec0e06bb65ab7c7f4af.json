Correlations between both fundamentally change the robustness of a network, yet they are disregarded in standard analytic methods as local tree or heterogeneous mean field approximations, since order statistics are difficult to capture analytically because of their combinatorial nature. We show how they become tractable in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size. This enables the analytic description of node attacks that are characterized by threshold allocations based on node degree. Using two examples, we discuss possible implications of irregular phase transitions and different speeds of cascade evolution for the control of cascades.",

A node fails (s i = 1) whenever its load exceeds its threshold, \u03b8 i \u03bb i (t ). The load \u03bb i (t ) can change over time, is measured in discrete time steps, t = 0, . . . , T , and is dependent on the interaction between nodes. Usually, an interaction is defined by a form of load distribution. A failing node sends load to nodes it is connected with (i.e., its network neighbors). The number of these neighbors is called the degree of the node. The load distribution can cause further node failures and kick off a failure cascade that spans a considerable share of the whole network. A robust network is considered to be less prone to large cascades that start from a few initial failures.",

Such correlations are empirically grounded, e.g., well connected banks have the tendency of lower equity than less connected banks [10, 18] , even though the opposite is expected to lead to more robust systems [19, 20] . Some models already assume that a threshold depends explicitly on the node degree [17, 21, 22] or on degree-related centrality measures. Also the study of random or targeted attacks on networks can be described by our approach, as the allocation of a threshold that is smaller than the initial load \u03b8 \u03bb 0 implies the initial failure of the node with this threshold and can also be interpreted as an attack of this node. In this well studied context, it is important to note that, dependent on the specific network, attack strategies based on centrality measures can be more effective than attacks based on node degrees [23] .",

Thus, the main node variables of interest are node degrees and thresholds. The study of these ensembles has the advantage that ensemble averages of interesting quantities can be derived by analytic iterative approaches, so called local tree approximations (LTAs) or heterogeneous mean field approximations (HMFs). They become exact in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size N \u2192 \u221e (where N is the number of nodes in the network). These approximations have been extended to capture degree-degree correlations. Yet, surprisingly, the equally fundamental correlations between degrees and thresholds have not been studied analytically. Only one specific case, i.e., the removal of nodes with higher degrees, has been studied for percolation [26, 27] . Other investigations of deterministic attacks so far rely on simulations [19, 22] . Imposing correlations includes the ranking of nodes and this leads to order statistics that are difficult to capture analytically. In this work, we show that for infinitely large networks the ranks simplify significantly and we can identify them by a transformation of the respective cumulative distribution function (cdf).",

Correspondingly, N thresholds are drawn independently from an arbitrary threshold distribution with cdf (\u03b8 ) and ordered \u03b8 1/N \u03b8 2/N \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03b8 N/N . Each node in the network receives exactly one degree and one threshold. A specific allocation or attack strategy a defines this assignment. It thus decides which nodes are prone to failure because of a small threshold. Formally, a is a bijective (Borel-measurable) function a : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] that assigns each degree rank i/N a threshold rank a(i/N ). Thus, a node has degree k i/N and threshold \u03b8 a(i/N ) . While a can be nonlinear in general, the two most common heuristics correspond to linear a. In the case of the identity a(x) = x, thresholds and degrees are perfectly positively correlated. Nodes with a higher degree receive higher thresholds and are less prone to failure, while peripheral nodes with a small degree are conjectured to fail. We call this threshold allocation the peripheral failures (pf) scheme. The choice a(x) = 1 \u2212 x, on the other hand, means that degrees and thresholds are perfectly anticorrelated. Nodes with higher degrees receive lower thresholds and therefore are more prone to fail. Hence, this threshold allocation is focused on hubs and we refer to it as the central failures (cf) scheme.",

Figure 4 provides an overview for all considered cases. Introducing correlations between threshold and degrees, we can confirm this finding for negative correlations, i.e., for the central failures scheme (the higher the degree the lower the threshold). However, if we choose positive correlations between threshold and degrees (peripheral failures), the ED model on average leads to smaller cascades than the DD model. Hence, positive correlations can significantly improve the robustness of the ED network.",

We observe a similar phenomenon for ED cascades, interestingly for both topologies, not only for scale free networks. Even more, correlations can lead to larger cascades than in case of uncorrelated threshold allocations. But this conclusion does not apply to DD models, i.e., it strongly depends on the dynamics of the cascade. Further, it is also sensitive to the parameters \u03bc and \u03c3 characterizing the threshold distribution. In some cases, even the combination DD and cf that is usually most robust can lead to the largest cascades. Still, the combination DD and cf is able to reduce the largest average cascades for both topologies. Hence, it can be considered as the most promising strategy for increasing cascades. This is the goal in the spreading of rumor, for instance.",

Usually, increasing the threshold heterogeneity \u03c3 leads to a sudden increase of \u03c1 followed by a slow continuous decrease. Yet, for ED and pf, \u03c1 can jump several times for small changes of \u03c3 . The presence of positive correlations between thresholds and degrees (pf) changes even the qualitative nature of the ED phase diagram. Our simulations confirm that these observations cannot be attributed to (hypothetical) numerical instabilities when calculating our approximations. Second, neither of the two studied variants, ED and pf and DD and cf, outperforms the other for all threshold parameters, as depicted in Fig. 5(b) . While ED and pf leads to the smallest average cascades for most threshold parameters, DD and cf reduces the severity of cascades in the region of big cascades.",
