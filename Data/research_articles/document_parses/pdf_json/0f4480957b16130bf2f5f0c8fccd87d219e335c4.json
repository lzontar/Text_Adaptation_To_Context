Its conceptual simplicity has made it the most widely used technique in molecular biology and it can, in theory, detect as little as a single fragment of DNA. Hence, it is widely used as a diagnostic test for a huge range of bacterial, fungal, viral and parasite pathogens. However, the genome of coronaviruses consists of ribonucleic acid (RNA) rather than DNA. Whilst RNA is similar to DNA, it is sufficiently different that Taq polymerase, the standard enzyme used for DNA amplification, replicates it only very inefficiently. Consequently, RNA is detected by a variant of the PCR test, termed reverse transcription (RT)-PCR [2].This encompasses a two-step method, typically comprising two enzymes; the first step uses a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, also known as a reverse transcriptase, to copy RNA into DNA (cDNA), the second step then switches to the use of Taq polymerase, which amplifies the cDNA as in a standard PCR test (Figure 1 ).

Given that on 9th January 2020 SARS-CoV-2 was definitively identified by the Chinese CDC as the causative agent for COVID-19 pneumonia and that its genomic sequence (GenBank accession number MN908947) was made available on 10th January, it is extraordinary that by the time the earliest documented transmission within the UK appeared on 28th February, no definitive action plan, stockpile of assays and required consumables, RNA extraction robots or high throughput qPCR instruments had been assembled to allow immediate and widespread RT-qPCR testing.

The quantification cycle (Cq) is at the heart of accurate and reproducible quantification using RT-qPCR. Fluorescence values are recorded during every cycle and represent the amount of product amplified up to that point in the amplification reaction. The more template present at the beginning of the reaction, the fewer cycles it takes to reach a point at which the fluorescent signal is first recorded as statistically significant above background. This point is defined as the Cq and will always occur during the exponential phase of amplification. Therefore, quantification is not affected by any reaction components becoming limited in the plateau phase [2] . However, it is important not to rely solely on the Cq when reporting results, as Cq values are subject to inherent inter-run variation [6] and should not be used without appropriate calibration standards [5] . One obvious way to achieve reliable quantification is to include an RNA molecule of known copy number as a spike with the RNA following extraction. This would allow both a measure of quality control, as any deviation from the expected Cq would suggest some inhibition of the reaction, as well as determination of viral copy number relative to that spike.

It is delays in the bureaucratic validation and approval process and lack of involvement of the wider research and commercial service provider community by public health laboratories that are at the heart of the testing conundrum. An immediate solution would be to centralise RNA extraction procedures in containment level 3 facilities, but devolve testing of non-infectious RNA to nation-wide laboratories, where each country has a large pool of experienced staff willing to carry out the actual testing. For future pandemics, there is an obvious need for public health organisations such as the US CDC and UK PHE to learn some significant lessons and establish protocols for emergency testing systems that can be rapidly adopted in emergency situations. For now, the Coronavirus standards working group (https://jimb.stanford.edu/covid-19-standards), led by the Joint Initiative for Metrology in Biology, is developing a set of guidelines to ensure the availability of common, appropriate standards, controls, validation tests and protocols that are essential for the accuracy of test results. They also aim to develop an annotated inventory of resources, identify gaps, and conduct international collaborative experiments to evaluate and establish comparability of the diverse control materials and test methods available. The group will institute an open information repository of validation methods and data. This should lead to collaboratively produced reference materials and samples as well as reference measurement methods to secure an enduring and reliable COVID testing enterprise.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conflicts of Interest:"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Specific Enzymatic Amplification of DNA In Vitro: The Polymerase Chain Reaction", "authors": [{"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mullis", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Faloona", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Saiki", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Horn", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Erlich", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Scharf", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1986, "venue": "Cold Spring Harb.
