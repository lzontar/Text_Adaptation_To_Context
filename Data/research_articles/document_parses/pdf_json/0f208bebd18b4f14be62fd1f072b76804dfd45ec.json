Unfortunately, despite several previous research efforts, expert recommendation still remains problematic for various reasons. Firstly, question-answering (QA) communities are inherently time-evolving [21] , with new users (both askers and answerers) joining daily and the existing users changing their interests and behavior (such as, e.g., long-term inactive users, who turn into active participants). Hitherto, expert recommendation has been studied, mostly by ignoring the temporal information of posts. Accordingly, the devised approaches are suitable neither to deal with the natural drift of users' interests over time, nor to promote short-term answerers (i.e., users with a limited recent answering history). This is a severe limitation, that lowers the effectiveness of expert recommendation, since the recommended experts may no more reply to questions matching initially-relevant and already-outdated interests. In addition, short-term answerers would likely not be recommended at all, being their expertise gained in a far too short time period for such users to build a solid reputation as actual experts. Secondly, there is no common agreement on the choice of the discriminative content features to capture answerers' expertise. In most studies, the latter is inferred from the raw text of their answers, suitably weighted by the respective votes from the QA community. Tags are mainly ignored or, alternatively, incorporated into post contents as in [20] . However, tags are more insightful, concise and explicit user-generated explanations of both post meaning and topical expertise, with respect to the general topics inferrable from the textual post contents [19] . Thirdly, supplementing content features with further auxiliary data (e.g., networks of user interactions) for more effective expert recommendation involves devising a plausible joint processing of such information. Hitherto, both sources of information have been combined mainly through simplistic schemes such as, e.g., linear interpolation [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 22, "end": 26, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 119, "end": 123, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 327, "end": 331, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1597, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1805, "end": 1809, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2158, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this paper, we propose a new collaborative approach to recommending question-specific experts in QA communities. The expertise of answerers is determined from the tags, votes and temporal information of their answers as well as the asking-answering relationships in the targeted QA community. More precisely, answer tags are employed to capture and represent the topical expertise of answerers. Votes indicate the degree to which answerers are publicly acknowledged within the QA community as experts under the tags of the respective answers. Posting time allows for discounting [8] earlier answers of responders, so that to account for the natural drift of their interests over time, without penalizing short-term answerers. Besides, asking-answering interactions inform the identification of experts, since repliers to expert askers are likely to be expert as well. Essentially, for each posted question, the intuition behind the presented approach consists in recommending answerers, who are credited the highest degree of expertise under the tags of the particular question at routing time. In particular, the expertise of answerers under already replied tags is intuitively determined by means of the votes and temporal information of their answers to the questions labelled with such tags. Instead, the unknown expertise of answerers under not yet replied tags is predicted through a latent-factor generative model of temporally-discounted user expertise and asking-answering behavior. Under such a model, Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization [15] and the statistical formalization of asking-answering are seamlessly integrated. This allows for explaining both the expertise of users and their behavioral patterns as the result of a generative process, that is governed by a certain number of latent factors. These are estimated via a MCMC algorithm, that implements the derived mathematical details of Gibbs sampling inference under the devised model.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 582, "end": 585, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1563, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Extensive tests over real-world CQA data show that our approach overcomes several state-of-the-art competitors in recommendation effectiveness. This paper proceeds as follows. Notation and preliminaries are introduced in Sect. 2. The devised model is developed in Sect. 3. Expertise prediction for recommendation and posterior inference are covered in Sect. 4. The experimental evaluation of our approach is presented in Sect. 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sect. 6, where future research is also previewed. The generic user u \u2208 U can ask questions and/or provide answers. In order to capture the expertise of u, we focus on her answering history a u = {a u,1 , . . . , a u,Nu }. a u is the time sequence of N u replies from u to as many questions posted by other users of D. The arbitrary answer a u,h \u2208 a u (with h = 1, . . . , N u ) is associated with a respective timestamp ts u,h , an explicative set of tags t u,h \u2286 T and a vote score s u,h . ts u,h indicates when a u,h was posted. For any two answers a u,hi , a u,hj \u2208 a u , h i < h j iff ts u,hi < ts u,hj . Timestamps are useful for reasonably dealing with the drift of the interests and skills of u, across the respective answering history a u , by means of gradual forgetting [8] . The latter consists in estimating the expertise of u from the whole answering history a u , so that the earlier answers are realistically considered to be outdated and, thus, less informative of her current interests and skills. The tags in t u,h are an insightful description of the actual themes covered by a u,h 1 . In principle, t u,h is a more accurate representation of the both the intended meaning of a u,h and the topical expertise of u, in comparison with the more general topics inferrable from the textual content of a u,h [19] . For this reason, the wording of a u,h is disregarded and, consequently, the computational burden of processing very large amounts of raw text is avoided. s u,h indicates the acknowledged degree of expertise gained by u with regard to the question answered through a u,h and, by extension, under each tag within t u,h .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1244, "end": 1247, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1789, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "At the current timestamp now , the expertise of all users in U under the tags of T is summarized by matrix E (now ) .
