To this end, we applied the Regularized Laplacian (RL) (9), a widely-used technique for semi-supervised learning (\"Methods\").

These drugs interfere with different aspects of the viral life cycle, including fusion with the cell membrane, proteolysis, translation, and RNA replication (4). Since a virus must necessarily co-opt host cellular processes in order to replicate, an alternative attractive approach is to develop or repurpose drugs that target human proteins that the virus requires. To this end, a global, whole-genome view of host-pathogen interactions is likely to be valuable (5) , especially in the case of SARS-CoV-2, given the size of its genome and the complexity of the observed clinical and epidemiological manifestations of COVID-19 (6) . In this work, we present a strategy based on network-based functional label prediction to prioritize human proteins as drug targets and to highlight existing, approved drugs as anti-COVID-19 agents (Figure 1 ). We base our computational approach on the hypothesis that human proteins belonging to complexes or signaling pathways that are proximal to human interactors of viral proteins are potentially good targets for inhibition. Accordingly, we take advantage of a recently published dataset of human proteins that physically interact with SARS-CoV-2 (7) . These SARS-CoV-2 interactors are entry points to host cellular processes that may be hijacked by viral infection.",

Therefore, to prioritize additional human proteins, we formulate identification of downstream interactors of SARS-CoV-2 as a network labeling problem capable of tolerating uncertainty in its inputs. Specifically, given the known human protein interactors of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and a whole-genome protein interaction network, we use network propagation algorithms to predict other potential SARS-CoV-2 interactors. We first demonstrate with that this approach predicts known SARS-CoV-2 interactors with high accuracy. We further analyze highly-ranking proteins computed by these methods to identify statistically-enriched biological cellular processes and pathways that may be impacted by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we integrate drugprotein interactions into this framework to propose drugs that may be repositioned to treat COVID-19. We present several case studies that illustrate how drugs that target highly-ranked proteins may inhibit the virus in different stages of its life cycle. Some of these drugs are already in clinical trials for COVID- 19 . We emphasize that the drugs discussed in this work are in silico predictions that require further experimental and clinical validation before they can be used as treatments for COVID-19. Ellipses highlight manually selected biclusters. Each bicluster includes a set of SARS-CoV-2 interactors that contribute high scores to a set of top-ranking proteins.

Many of the proteins annotated to this term are translocases of the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondrion. These proteins comprise complexes that transport proteins across the mitochondrial membranes. \"NADH dehydrogenase complex assembly\" is a related GO biological process (Figure 4(d) ), which has a p-value of 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u221212 for RL in contrast to a p-value of 0.035 in SARS-CoV-2 interactors.

Due to oxygen deprivation, cells switch from respiration to glycolysis. We note that a recent genome-wide CRISPR screen for human genes that regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection (23) identified several members of the respiratory chain as \"anti-viral\", i.e., the knockout of the gene sensitizes the host cell to virus-induced cell death. Thus, the GO terms enriched in our results may suggest mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates cellular respiration in the host to promote infection.",

The GO biological process \"protein demannosylation\", the removal of a mannose group from a protein, is enriched in top-ranking RL proteins (pvalue 4.48 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) but not in SARS-CoV-2 interactors (p-value 0.08). Key top-ranking proteins in this network ( Figure 4 (e)) include MAN1B1 and UGGT1, which are localized to the ER. Enveloped viruses have been shown to hijack the host cell's ER for survival and replication, thereby causing ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (24) . MAN1B1 plays a role in protein quality control as well as in their degradation (25) . The utilization of UGGT1 by enteroviruses leads to increased viral replication and higher pathogenicity (26) . Viral protein Orf8 interacts with human OS9 (an ER degradation protein), which in turn interacts with top-ranking protein EDEM1 (ER degradation-enhancing alphamannosidase-like protein 1). EDEM1 controls the degradation of mis-folded glycoproteins and is a key player in ERAD (27) When EDEM1 is cleared from the ER, it is transported out of the organelle in nanoscale vesicles that are called EDEMosmomes. Coronavirusess such as the mouse hepatitis virus subsequently hijack these organelles and remodel them to form double membrane vesicles (DMVs) (28) . DMVs are widely used by viruses, including coronaviruses, to promote viral replication (29) .",

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to lead to ER stress and the up-regulation of HSPA5 (35, 36) . The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 can induce transcriptional activation of HSPA5 (36) . This protein can serve as a point of attachment for both MERS-COV and bat coronavirus (bCOV HKU9) (37) . Both Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus use HSPA5 to prevent apoptosis and to help in viral replication (38) . A recent molecular docking study has predicted HSPA5 as a potential receptor for the SARS-CoV S protein (39) . Based on its observed expression in vitro in airway epithelial cells, it has been suggested that HSPA5 may serve as an additional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in these cells (40) . Based on our network-based analysis and support in the literature, we hypothesize that HSPA5 may serve as a co-receptor, a point of viral attachment, or aid in viral entry of SARS-CoV-2.",

Relevant to SARS-CoV-2, microtubules are the primary structural component of cilia, which line epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and are responsible for the transport of mucus out of cells (50) . The ACE2 receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter cells appears to be expressed primarily on the cilia of respiratory tract epithelial cells (51, 52) , further implicating microtubules in viral infection. The combination of high expression levels of ACE2 and the presence of cilia may also explain the detection of the virus in multiple organs (53) and the deleterious effect of COVID-19 on the renal, gastroinstestinal, and olfactory systems (54) .",

This problem is well-known with several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate it either by grouping similar terms and selecting a small subset of dissimilar terms (74, 75) or by directly computing a set of non-redundant GO terms (76, 77) . As far as we can tell, these methods have been developed to consider the enriched GO terms for one set of terms. When we apply them independently to different sets of proteins (e.g., predictions from RL and predictions from SVM), they may select one term for one set of proteins but a similar but not identical term for another set, making the distinctions in enrichment hard to discern. Therefore, taking inspiration from previously developed methods (cited above), we developed a simple heuristic based on the weighted set cover algorithm that simultaneously simplifies multiple sets of enriched terms or pathways. For every term that is enriched in at least one protein set, we defined its composite odds ratio to be the product of the odds ratios for that term across the protein sets. We iteratively selected the term with the largest composite odds ratio, deleted the proteins annotated to this term from the annotations of all other enriched term, adjusted the odds ratio for every term, and recomputed the composite odds ratios. We stopped when the maximum composite odds ratio of the remaining terms became less than one. We demonstrate how this algorithm was successful in reducing the redundancy among enriched GO terms in Section S2.4.",

To understand the diversity of the predictions across the prediction methods, between each pair of algorithms, we computed the Spearman's correlation of all scores. We also compared the top-ranking predictions between algorithms using the Jaccard index. RL had a high correlation with Local (0.75), which was surprising given the poor performance of Local. However, the Jaccard index for the two methods was around 0.1 ( Figure S3 ",

To tune the methods, we varied the parameter \u03b1 for RL, the weight of the edges \u03bb connecting each node to the artificial sink for SS, and the parameter C controlling the inverse of the regularization strength for SVM and LR.

We show the results for the ratios 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 in Figure S4 and observed the results were fairly consistent across ratios.

We generated this figure using MORPHEUS https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus. Figure S6 shows a number of biclusters that represent groups of experimentally iden-tified viral interactors (columns) that contribute substantially to diffusion scores of predicted high-ranking proteins in the network as described in \"Methods\". High diffusion biclusters can naturally emerge either in long signaling chains or in dense subnetworks such as complexes. We hypothesize that these biclusters may arise from densely-connected subnetworks that are exploited by the virus to perturb host processes to promote viral infection.",

In the case of HSPA5, we find that despite it having well-documented connections to CANX and CALR, it does not appear alongside them in bicluster 7 and instead is included in bicluster 8. This behavior could arise from the many additional functions HSPA5 has on the cell surface in addition to its role in blood coagulation along with CANX and CALR as discussed in \"Results\". Despite not being included in bicluster 7, the HSPA5 score contributions that are attributed to the viral interactors of bicluster 7 are indicative of relatively high diffusion similar to that of the other rows in bicluster 7. Although HSPA5, CANX, and CALR are not directly adjacent in Figure S6 , further observation reveals that there is notable overlap in the viral interactors that significantly contribute to their respective diffusion scores. We illustrate this point in Figure S6 in the form of the additional row shown in the breakout for bicluster 7.",

TBCA is the gene that codes for the tubulin-specific chaperone A protein which is involved in beta-tubulin binding to facilitate tubulin complex assembly (78, 79) . Within the first 25 highest ranked contributors in each plot, we observe another sharp decrease to near zero relative contribution from the remaining seed nodes. We view this steep drop-off as an indication that seed nodes could be clustered such that diffusion from one group of seed nodes to a given protein far outweighs that of another set of seed nodes. These lower contribution seed nodes could be configured in either a distant cluster or such that many individual nodes are distributed widely. Further analysis using diffusion mapping techniques could assist in distinguishing between these two proposed configurations.",

We started with the human functional interaction network in the STRING database (version 11) (71), comprising of 18,886 nodes and 977,789 edges after applying a \"medium\" score cutoff of 400. We used the interaction reliabilities provided by STRING as edge weights; we divided each value in STRING by 1, 000 to scale them between 0 and 1. An edge in this network may bederived from experimental data or computational analysis. Thus, an edge may represent either direct physical binding or indirect functional interaction. Of the 332 viral interactors, 328 were present in this network; REEP6 (Q96HR9), PPIL3 (Q9H2H8), RAB18 (Q9NP72), and FKBP7 (Q9Y680) were missing. Negative Examples. To evaluate the precision of our predictions, we needed negative examples. Since datasets of human proteins that are certain not to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are not available, we took the simple expedient of sampling them uniformly at random from the STRING network. We considered three different numbers of negative examples: as many as, five times, and ten times the number of positive examples. When we applied the methods to the full set of positive examples, we averaged the results over 100 random samples, with a positive:negative ratio of 1:5. Drug-protein interactions. We downloaded interactions among drugs and proteins from the DrugBank database (version 5.1.6) (72).

Limiting the targets to those in the STRING network reduced the number of drugs and targets to 5the prediction algorithms using 100 runs of five-fold cross validation. In each run we ensured that all algorithms saw identical partitions of the examples into folds.
