Patients with FMF have an intense biological inflammatory syndrome during attacks and a chronic subclinical inflammatory syndrome between the attacks characterized by cytokine activation and a TH1 polarization. Moreover, asymptomatic heterozygote carriers of even low penetrance MEFV mutations (like E148Q) have been reported to have increased levels of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid-A protein and the mRNAs for the cytokines TNF, IL1, IL6 and IL18 as well as a TH1 polarization of the inflammation process. This asymptomatic inflammatory syndrome has been considered as probably responsible for manifestations of amyloidosis in asymptomatic FMF carriers. On the other hand, this inflammatory syndrome perhaps was a protective factor against frequent and lethal infectious diseases before the antibiotic era, explaining the high prevalence of MEFV mutations \uf05b2\uf05d.",

This putative advantage was probably operative against diseases that are now welltreated or have disappeared from the areas of interest like tuberculosis, smallpox, cholera, plague, typhus and malaria \uf05b2\uf05d.",
