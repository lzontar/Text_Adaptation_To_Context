Defining the overlap coefficient \u03b1 as the Jaccard index, we prove that \u03b1 is very close to 0 when A and B are random and independently generated. We derive an upper bound \u03b1 M for the maximum overlap coefficient permitted in terms of p A (k), p B (k), and N . Then we present an algorithm based on cross rewiring of links to obtain a two-layer network with any prescribed \u03b1 inside the range (0,\u03b1 M ). A refined version of the algorithm allows us to minimize the cross-layer correlations that unavoidably appear for values of \u03b1 beyond a critical overlap \u03b1 c < \u03b1 M . Finally, we present a very simple example of a susceptible-infectious-recovered epidemic model with information dissemination and use the algorithms to determine the impact of the overlap on the final outbreak size predicted by the model.",

In the second case, the description of the spread uses the concept of multilayer or multiplex network, namely, a set of nodes (individuals, computers, etc.) connected by qualitatively different types of links corresponding to possible relationships among them (acquaintanceship, friendship, physical contact, social networks, etc.), each layer defined by a type of connection. Competitive viruses spreading simultaneously through different routes of transmission over the same host population, or the spread of a pathogen and awareness during an epidemic episode are examples of processes that are better described by means of multilayer networks [1] .",

In fact \u03b1 is the Jaccard index, a statistic used for comparing the similarity of two sample sets, as defined in [11] . Just to illustrate that this simple statistical parameter can play a critical role in the qualitative response of a two-layer network model, in Sec. VIII we present a mean-field model for the spread of an infectious agent on one layer (contact layer). The model implicitly assumes an information dissemination on a second layer (notification layer) about the infection status of the nodes which causes an increase in awareness and the adoption of preventive behaviors. As an interesting feature, the overlap coefficient \u03b1 between the networks embedding the respective routes of transmission is a parameter of the model. This allows us to derive a simple relationship between \u03b1 and the epidemic threshold. Provided that one wants to perform simulations to validate this (or any) model, a systematic procedure to generate couples of networks of given size and degree distributions with a prescribed value of \u03b1 would be a useful tool. We stress that this is the main focus of the paper, and that the model in Sec. VIII is just a simple example to illustrate the convenience of having such tools.",

III and IV we estimate the minimum and maximum values (call them \u03b1 m and \u03b1 M ) for the overlap coefficient between two networks of size N and degree distributions p A (k) and p B (k). In particular, we show that \u03b1 m \u2248 0. The study of the maximum \u03b1 M is based on the computation of the potential overlap O pot (D A ,D B ) between two fixed degree sequences D A ,D B following p A (k), p B (k). In Sec. V we present the CR algorithm, that takes as input any two degree sequences D A ,D B and a desired overlap \u03b1 \u2208 (0,O pot (D A ,D B )) and generates a couple of networks with degree sequences D A ,D B and overlap coefficient close to \u03b1. When D A ,D B are randomly sampled from p A (k),p B (k), the potential overlap O pot (D A ,D B ) is called critical overlap. In Sec. VI we show that the CR algorithm starting with two random sequences succeeds in constructing pairs of networks having any overlap below the critical one and exhibiting some desirable statistical properties, specifically lack of in-and cross-layer degree-degree correlations. Of course the critical overlap belongs to the interval (\u03b1 m ,\u03b1 M ), and is higher than expected from intuition. In Sec. VII we show that for values between the critical overlap and \u03b1 M there is an unavoidable direct relationship between overlap and cross-layer degreedegree correlation, and propose a refined version of the crossrewiring (CR) algorithm that tries to reach values beyond the critical overlap while maintaining the cross-layer degreedegree correlation as small as possible.",

Take a vector X of length 2L := k i containing k 1 times the integer 1 in the first k 1 entries, k 2 times the integer 2 in the following k 2 entries, etc. Each entry v of X represents a single stub (or semilink) attached at the node labeled as v. Then, take a random permutation of the entries of X to get a new array Y . Finally, read the contents of Y in order, interpreting each pair of consecutive entries v,w as a link between the nodes v and w. For an example, take N = 6 and consider the degree distribution p(k) defined by p(1) = p(3) = 1/6, p(2) = 4/6, and p(k) = 0 for k = 1,2,3. The corresponding degree set is {1,2,2,2,2,3}. Take, for instance, (1,2,2,2,2,3) as degree sequence. Then, X = (1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6). Now we permute X at random, obtaining Y = (3,4,5,1,6,3,6,2,4,5,2,6). Observe that the link {6,2} appears twice. In general, the configuration model algorithm gives multigraphs rather than graphs. It is well known, however, that the fraction of self-loops and multilinks over the total number of links goes to 0 as N \u2192 \u221e when the variance of the degree distribution is bounded [18] .

In all cases, the input degree sequences D,D are random arrangements of the degree sets associated to the respective distributions. The obtained overlap is relatively close to the upper bound, suggesting that indeed the CR algorithm is able to sweep the entire range of permitted overlaps between 0 and O pot (D,D ).",

A closer look at the physical transmission of an infection reveals that a suitable description of populations must take into account the network layer A of physical contacts among individuals, with nodes representing individuals and links corresponding to physical contacts along which disease can propagate. On the other hand, if one assumes that the probability of getting infected through an infectious contact S-I depends on the awareness state of the susceptible individual, then a second network layer B over which information about the infection status of individuals circulates can be considered. In the context of management and control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), an example of this second network layer is given by the partner notification program. This service helps to reach sexual contacts of patients of STDs and inform them that they may be at risk, and hence the need of seeking medical care [24, 25] . So, in our approach, if a pair of individuals, one susceptible and the other infectious, are connected to each other in both network layers, we assume that the transmission rate \u03b2 c (here c stands for common) will be smaller than the normal transmission rate \u03b2 because the susceptible partner adopts preventive measures to diminish the risk of contagion.",

So, the model will take into account the network layer A of physical contacts in terms of its degree distribution p A (k) = N k /N where N k is the number of individuals having degree k. Analogously, the information or notification network (network layer B) is described by its degree distribution p B (k). For the sake of brevity, a pair of nodes connected to each other in both networks is said to share a common link, although the natures of the connections are dissimilar.

For instance, a particular run of the LS-CR algorithm with prescribed overlap \u03b1 = 0.5 over two exponential networks of 5000 nodes and mean degrees 45 and 30 leads to a mean local overlap equal to 0.5439 and a standard deviation of 0.1790.

So, the value of p B|A does not depend on the degree of a node in layer A and, hence, the overlap between layers is uniformly distributed (i.e., there are no parts of the network more overlapped than others). Assumption (i) is guaranteed by the algorithms. However, assumption (ii) is not feasible when the architectures of both layers are very different from each other. Then, our simulations have been performed on networks with two different architectures reflecting two extreme cases. First, we have considered two-layer networks where each layer is in turn a regular random network. This guarantees that both hypotheses are satisfied and, moreover, a good accuracy of the mean-field approach for this type of network if the degree of each layer is high enough. Second, we have considered networks with both layers having exponential degree distributions which have a high variance. In both cases, the mean degrees are 45 (layer A) and 30 (layer B), both high enough to minimize the impact of stochastic fluctuations around infected nodes.",

This derivation of the final epidemic size is presented for the sake of completeness because, indeed, it follows from the one given in Ref. [26] , Appendix E, in a more general setting. Figures 2 and 3 show the histograms of final outbreak sizes obtained from the stochastic simulations on regular random networks (RNNs) and on networks with exponential degree distributions, respectively, for three values of \u03b1. These figures also show the mean final epidemic size given by Eq. (18) after numerically solving Eq. (19) using the generated degree sequence in layer A. When the CR algorithm is applied and the distribution of major outbreaks is clearly distinguished from the one of minor outbreaks (otherwise to talk about the final size of an epidemic makes no sense), the predicted final size on RNNs is almost the same as the mean final size of the major outbreaks (4853 vs 4850, 4816 vs 4818, and 4776 vs 4775 for \u03b1 = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and rounded values). For the exponential networks, the predicted final epidemic size differs less than 5% from the mean final size of major outbreaks for most of the networks generated with the configuration model with different degree distributions (not shown here). In Fig. 3 , this disagreement is indeed less than 2%. Therefore, in these cases the proposed mean-field model qualitatively captures the impact of the overlap on the expected final size of an epidemic.",

We call this upper bound potential overlap between D and D and we denote it by O pot (D,D ).

Second, we introduce what we call the critical overlap \u03b1 m < \u03b1 c < \u03b1 M , defined as O pot (D rand ,D rand ) where D rand ,D rand are random sequences sampled from p(k),p (k). Against an initial intuition, \u03b1 c is closer to \u03b1 M than expected. We show that the CR algorithm with D rand ,D rand as input suffices to construct a pair of networks having any overlap below \u03b1 c and exhibiting some desirable statistical properties, specifically lack of in-and cross-layer degree-degree correlations.
