Reports from New York City described an alarming rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive pregnant patients (13.7-14.5%) [6, 7] . Although Washington State was among the first to confirm community transmission [8] , our regional epidemic appears to be slowing with early public health response and widespread testing availability [9] . On March 2, 2020, University of Washington (UW) Department of Laboratory Medicine obtained Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 test. Initial testing at UW Medicine focused on symptomatic persons under investigation (PUI), transitioning to universal testing of labor and delivery (L&D) and",

While we routinely retest known COVID-19 patients on admission and prior to procedures to inform infection prevention practice, the clinical significance of persistently positive PCR in the setting of clinical improvement including among L&D patients in unknown [10]. Our institutional practice is to maintain COVID-precautions using a testbased strategy, and counsel patients per CDC guidance that that the risk of transmission is substantially reduced after 10 days of symptom onset and >72 hours after symptom resolution [11]. Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of pregnant and postpartum patients occurred in conjunction with all pre-surgical patients, to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from intubation for general anesthesia, an aerosol-generating procedure. The pre-surgical universal SARS-CoV-2 screening policy was extended to L&D patients with the rationale that many require cesarean delivery or other surgical procedures and may potentially require urgent general anesthesia. Our cesarean delivery rates of 26-46% illustrate the frequency of surgery during a delivery hospitalization. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently strengthened their recommendations regarding testing on L&D units [12]. Our current institution-wide screening approach continues to evolve in response to local epidemiology and testing availability, and now includes universal screening of all hospital admissions. Our most recent estimates suggest <1% of asymptomatic patients have tested positive since initiating universal screening. Early adoption of universal screening (starting with surgical and L&D patients) allowed data-driven decisions to be made informing PPE use to ensure protection of patients and health care workers, including L&D-related units (i.e. newborn nursery and neonatal intensive care unit). Further, this information aided in counseling regarding risks and",
