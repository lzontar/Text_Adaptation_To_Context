One drawback of natural peptide drugs, however, is their proteolytic instability; peptidomimetics can help to overcome this caveat. In this review, we summarize peptide and peptidebased therapeutics that target one main entry pathway of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which involves the host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and viral spike (S) protein interaction. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages of peptidomimetics and other potential targets that have been studied using peptide-based therapeutics for COVID-19.",

            "text": "Multiple zoonotic events since the turn of the millennium have resulted in disease outbreaks in the human population, including influenza A, H1N1, H5N1, H7N9, Zika virus and Ebola virus. Outbreaks due to members of the coronavirus family have been especially prominent in terms of transmission and mortality, beginning with the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 [1, 2] , followed by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [3] and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) in late 2019 [4] . Key to the pathogenicity and infectivity of the coronavirus family in humans is the spike (S) protein, a large trimeric crown-like complex forming the namesake 'corona' as observed on electron microscopy ( Figure 1) . Gain of function studies on circulating strains of coronavirus in bats have evidenced the deterministic role of the S protein in selecting host species and tissue tropism [5] . The outbreak-associated coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share the commonality of binding host peptidases as their entry receptors; alternatively, other coronaviruses can recognize post-translational modifications such as glycans or adhesion molecules. Whereas MERS-CoV utilizes mainly dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) [6] , SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can enter human cells using angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) (Figures 2 & 3) [7, 8] as the primary receptor [9, 10] . Aside from recognition and entry through the primary receptor, secondary mechanisms exist for S protein mediated internalization, including through C-type lectins recognizing high-mannose glycans on the S protein [11] . Viral entry is also proposed to be possible through an endocytosis mechanism, with viral membrane fusion occurring in endosomes (reviewed in [9] ).",

Amino acid (aa) residues within the C-terminal domain of the S1 subunit form the receptor-binding domain (RBD) The S protein is composed of the two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 domain contains the NTD, the CTD, and is responsible for recognition and binding to the host cell receptor. responsible for receptor specificity ( Figure 3 ) [15, 16] . The RBD of the virus has been characterized in the sequence from the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS-CoV and it resided in amino acids 318-510 of the S protein [17] . The minimal-binding domain was determined to be on a short loop on the receptor-binding domain consisting of 14 amino acid residues (424-494) of the S protein in these previous studies. The RBD sequence has been compared by the same group in SARS-CoV-2 and it resides in aa residues 331-524, furthermore, this report details sequence variation and conserved residues between SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. The sequence similarity in the S2 domain is more conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, making this region a better potential drug target for pan-SARS-CoV therapeutics [14, 18] . Studies have determined that after host receptor binding (ACE2), the viral S protein is processed by host cell proteases, including TMPRSS2 or likely other proteases [9, 19] . Cleavage at the S1/S2 boundary releases the strain exerted on the S2 subunit by the S1 subunit, leading to a dramatic conformational change. The S2 subunit possesses fusion peptide (FP) domains, which help to mediate membrane binding between host and virus. The second protease cleavage site S2 ( Figure 3 ) exposes the FP permitting the formation of a six-helix bundle (composed of three alpha helixes each from the heptad repeat 1 and 2 regions [HR1 and HR2]), which mediates host/virus membrane fusion events, resulting in the delivery of the viral genetic material into the host cell. The tissue-specific distribution of proteases capable of processing the S protein further narrows the tropism of particular coronaviruses beyond the cell and organ-specific location of the primary receptor, ACE2 (reviewed in [19] ).",

The advantages of peptides as drugs are rapid discovery, their specificity and affinity to desired targets, and low toxicity due to the limited possibility for accumulation in the body. Early on, peptides were considered poor drug candidates due to the inefficient and expensive synthesis processes, low bioavailability and limited stability against proteolysis by peptidases in the gastrointestinal tract and serum (t 1/2 of natural and synthetic peptides are usually on the order of a few minutes). Thanks to technological advances, two chemical methodologies: solution-phase synthesis in 1953 [26] and solid-phase peptide synthesis in 1963 [27] dramatically dropped the cost of peptide manufacturing.

Following receptor binding, subsequent conformational changes in S2 creates a hydrophobic \u03b1-helical interface (six-helix bundle) as a result of binding between HR1 and HR2 regions [32] . The membrane fusion event is initiated when hydrophobic residues of the FP, insert in the host cell membrane.

In studies examining SARS-CoV (2003) membrane fusion, exogenously-administered HR2 peptides blocked endogenous HR2 peptide binding with endogenous HR1 domains. The membrane fusion reaction was therefore inhibited, and pore formation was prevented. HR2-based antagonist peptides were also speculated to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by the more highly conserved S2 subunits between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with 92.6 and 100% overall identity in HR1 and HR2 domains, respectively. In early 2020, Xia et al. reported their studies with the derivatives of SARS-CoV-2 HR2 peptides [33] . The group designed HR1-and HR2-derived peptides, termed 2019-nCoV-HR1P (aa924-965) and 2019-nCoV-HR2P (aa1168-1203), respectively (Table 1) , and together with known pan-CoV fusion inhibitor (EK1 peptide) [34] , explored their biological characteristics. Peptide-based inhibitors usually have a short half-life in vivo, which can critically limit their therapeutic effects. Emerging studies demonstrate that lipid-conjugated peptides exhibit dramatically increased antiviral potency and improved pharmacokinetics. To improve the inhibitory activity, Xia et al. applied conjugation chemistry to EK1, their work was published on 30th March in Cell Research [35] . Xia's group generated a series of lipopeptides by linking cholesterol (Chol) through an amino acid linker (GSG) and/or polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer to the C-terminus of EK1. Structure-activity relationship analysis suggested that 'GSGSG-PEG4' linker was optimal to bridge both parts of the conjugates and identified that EK1C4 exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. EK1C4 was 241-and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC 50 's of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, respectively, as compared with EK1. EK1C4 has also been shown to be very effective against infection by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs. In vivo, intranasally applied EK1C4 showed strong protection of mice against HCoV-OC43 infection. Results of preinfection and postinfection treatment suggested that EK1C4 could be used to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Thus, disrupting initial SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 is another strategy to inhibit the virus from entering human cells. Peptide-based entry inhibitors are attractive candidates to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction and may serve as an effective antiviral drugs. Recently, Zhang et al. [37] demonstrated that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) \u03b11 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD by using molecular dynamics simulations on the cocrystal structure of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD [31] . The team chemically synthesized a natural 23-mer peptide (aa 21-43) from the human ACE2 (hACE2) \u03b11 helix, termed SBP1. Kinetic binding assays using bio-layer interferometry was used to characterize the in vitro peptide-protein binding affinity. The results revealed that SBP1 strongly bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a disassociation constant (K D ) of 47 nM, which was comparable with that of the full-length hACE2 [46] . SBP1 is a first-in-class peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, which may effectively disrupt the SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interaction and block virus entry into human cells. However, the peptide needs to be tested in human cells and in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Han et al. [38] recently published a study in the journal ACS Nano that described how to use computer modeling to design compounds that mimic the spike protein's natural target, ACE2. Using a recently solved X-ray crystal structure of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 when it is bound to ACE2, researchers identified 15 amino acids from ACE2 that interact directly with the viral S protein. Then, four peptides (listed as inhibitors 1-4 in Table 1 .) containing this domain, or parts thereof, were designed and encompassed two sequential \u03b1-helices extracted from the PD of ACE2. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the double \u03b1-helical peptides (such as inhibitors 2-4) were structurally stable and conformationally fitted to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Proposed in the report, at least one peptide inhibitor was able to specifically bind to the spike protein and prevent SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interactions. Barh et al. [47] and Huang et al. [48] also shared their initial computational findings in preprints posted on preprints and BioRxiv, respectively. Using bioinformatics strategies, Barh et al. screened and designed several potential anti-S protein peptides that may limit viral attachment and entry. Binding to SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD with the peptides was determined by the HPEPDOCK protein-peptide docking server. Ten peptides were predicted as attractive therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Huang's group designed thousands of peptide binders that showed binding activity to SARS-CoV-2 in computational experiments. To enhance peptides' binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, researchers redesigned the peptide sequence by applying structural bioinformatics and sequence logo analyses. The top designed peptide binders were selected to run further experimental validations. Thus, computational approaches may lead us to find potential inhibitory peptides against SARS-CoV-2, but in vitro, and in vivo experiments are still required to evaluate and ensure their potential therapeutic efficacy.",

They help the SARS-CoV virus attach to the ACE2 receptor; this process leads to membrane fusion of the virus and the host cell. Xu et al. [39] studied the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV S protein fusion core and identified HR2-18 peptide, which comprises residues 1161-1187, derived from the HR2 region and binds to the relatively deep grooves on the surface of the central coiled coil. In another study, Yuan et al. [40] designed and identified 25 synthetic peptides; two of these peptides corresponded to the HR regions, HR1-1 and HR2-18, were identified as inhibitors, with EC 50 values of 0.14 and 1.1 \u03bcM, respectively. The potency of these peptides was studied by wild-type SARS-CoV assay, and only one peptide, HR2-18, was found to inhibit the entry of the SARS-CoV with low activity. As expected, varying the amino acid sequences, addition or deletion of amino acid units found to be detrimental for the inhibition activity. On the other side, Han et al. [41] performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis to identify then design peptides that resembled residues critical for entry mediated by the ACE2 receptor. They tested the activity of six synthetic peptides analogous to significant segments in ACE2. P6, which is a peptide comprised two discontinuous fragments, aa 22-44 and 351-357 connected by glycine (Table 1) . This peptide potently inhibited SARS pseudovirus infection with an IC 50 of approximately 0.1 \u03bcM. However, this peptide has not been studied in an animal model yet. Sainz et al. [42] studied and identified novel peptides just outside the HR sequences between the N-and the C-helical HR domains. Two peptides labeled SARSWW-III and SARSWW-IV were recognized within the S2 subunit corresponding to the aa residues 1028-1049 and 1075-1093, respectively. Based on the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS), both peptides show potent inhibition for the viral infectivity with 5.7 and 7.1 points, respectively. The authors reason the inhibition effect to conformational changes required by the S2 protein during the fusion event. This group demonstrated that SARSWW-III and SARSWW-IV inhibited viral plaque formation on Vero E6 cells by 90 and 83%, respectively, at peptide concentrations of \u223c30 \u03bcM. Such findings establish solid foundations for the development of new fusion peptide inhibitors related to the HR-adjacent regions. These studies spotlight the HR region as a critical target for the viral entry. These initial investigations have laid the groundwork for current research in targeting membrane fusion related sequences in the S2 region that could be potent viral entry inhibitors or significant functional probes.",

[43] recognized the focal point of the viral protein that is necessary for the binding to the human cells. They identified RDB-11b (Table 1) , a hexapeptide (438YKYRYL443) in the RBD of the S protein of SARS-CoV that binds to the human cell with recognizable affinity and specificity. RDB-11b found to reduce the viral infection of the epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract by a factor of 600. In a comprehensive screening for viral entry inhibitor peptides of the SARS-CoV BJ01, Hu et al. [44] recognized S 471-503 , a peptide that overlaps the RBD of SARS-CoV. This peptide inhibits the viral entry by blocking the binding between the S protein RBD and the ACE2 receptor with high specificity. S 471-503 could inhibit the SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells in vitro with an IC 50 of 4.0 \u03bcM (with an EC 50 value of 41.6 \u03bcM). After a few months, Ho et al. [45] reported another inhibitory peptide derived from S protein, named SP-10 (aa residues 668-679). Using a biotinylated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, SP-10 was found to significantly inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV S protein to ACE2, with an IC 50 value of 1.88 \u00b1 0.52 nM. Further analysis by immunofluorescence assays and S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus infectivity indicated that SP-10 can block both interactions of S protein and the infectivity of S protein-pseudotyped retrovirus with Vero E6 cells. These peptide-based inhibitors provided the theoretical basis for the work done on SARS-CoV-2 and have the potential to lead to potent cell fusion inhibitors against coronaviruses.",
