If, as is suggested by FERY and NILSSON (1993) this chromosomal arrangement is a synapomorphy, then it suggests a close relationship between those species having it. The karyotype of I. wasastjernae may represent an intermediate arrangement between that found in Agabus and that found in the other Ilybius species. This would be consistent with the basal position of the I. opacus species group (which includes I. wasastjernae ) within the Ilybius clade in the mitochondrial DNA analysis reported by RIBERA et al. (2004) . Information on the karyotypes of other species of the I. opacus group (which includes I. wasastjernae) would be interesting in this context. The Ilybius species with karyotypes having 34 autosomes show some interspecific differences in the relative lengths of the chromosomes, as well as in centromere position, but these are not great. The inversion polymorphism shown by autosome 15 of I. chalconatus is noteworthy, and it would be helpful to find material heterozygous for this character. The karyotype of I. montanus sometimes conforms to the same pattern as the other species, but shows an exceptional variation in chromosome number. This variation is caused by fusion between chromosomes and is continuous in that all chromosome events show all possible variations, homozygous unfused, heterozygous and homozygous fused. There is thus no evidence that the differences in chromosome number are leading to speciation. This is supported by the morphology of the beetle, which does not show any signs of variation suggestive of speciation. Analysis of meiotic cells shows an apparently normal sequence of events, and testes of individuals heterozygous for fusions show normal spermatogenesis with no trace of degenerating cells, which might follow from failed meiosis. Thus the beetles do not show any evidence of reduced fertility, despite the chromosomal variation. Heterozygosity for chromosomal fusions and the consequent formation of trivalents at first division of meiosis, might have been expected to disrupt meiosis or to result in the production of aneuploid cells. However, we have been unable to find any evidence of this. The most likely explanation for this is that in the trivalents the positions of the chiasmata are such that separation during first anaphase, each chromosome always has one centromere: there are no acentrics or dicentrics. Thus chiasmata must be either in the longer of the chromosomes involved in the fusions, or distal to the centromere of the short chromosome when aligned for pairing \u00c1/ i.e. in its short arm.
