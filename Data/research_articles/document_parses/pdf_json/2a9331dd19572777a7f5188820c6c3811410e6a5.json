Dose reduction is required in patients receiving concurrent continuous venovenous hemofiltration and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [26]. Dose-adjusted oseltamivir is efficacious and safe in patients with end-stage renal failure receiving renal replacement therapy [27]. & Intravenous (IV) oseltamivir was shown to have a favourable safety and pharmacokinetic profile in phase I clinical studies [28] but further development has been stopped. & The suspension formulation (or dispersed capsules) of oseltamivir can be administered via nasogastric tube in mechanically ventilated patients who have reliable gastric absorption [29]. Zanamivir & Zanamivir has very low oral bioavailability [13] and is therefore administered via oral inhalation of a dry powder or IV. The approved route of administration is oral inhalation, using a purpose-manufactured device. The standard treatment dose of 10 mg 12-hourly is administered as two 5 mg inhalations, for 5 days. Renal dose adjustment is not required in patients receiving inhalational therapy [30]. & Administration of zanamivir in a lactose powder solution via endotracheal nebulisation (of the commercial powder containing lactose) has been reported in intubated patients with severe influenza. This route of administration has resulted in ventilator malfunction, which likely contributed to mortality [31, 32]. The commercial lactose powder formulation of zanamivir should only be used for oral inhalation [33]. & IV zanamivir is in clinical development and has shown promising results in a phase II study [34]; renal dose adjustment is required [34, 35]. IV formulations can be accessed under clinical trial or Emergency Investigational New Drug access schemes in some countries. Peramivir & Peramivir is administered IV. One dose is sufficient in outpatients as the drug exhibits prolonged anti-influenza activity [36]. A dose of 600 mg IV daily is recommended in high-risk adult patients [37]. The optimal duration of therapy in complicated disease remains unclear. Dose adjustment is required in renal impairment [38]. & Peramivir was associated with favourable outcomes in patients with severe pandemic influenza treated under an Emergency Investigational New Drug access scheme [38]. However, in a subsequent publication, peramivir was associated with increased risk of influenza-related complications, and death in patients with severe influenza [39]. These findings may have been influenced by disease severity.
