We explicitly formulate the derivation of inertial force as the emergent gravitational attraction from the Entanglement First Law. This entropic mechanism leads to a rigorous formulation of Entropic Gravity theories to generic situations, reproducing the Newton's Second Law in Rindler space and the gravitational force (together with derivation of the Einstein equation) beyond the near-horizon region. It also corresponds to a new holographic interpretation, which can be adapted into the AdS/CFT framework. Besides, the understanding of the gravitational attraction from this mechanism also suggests a simple function S ext = m rad T H = 8\u03c0G(M \u2212 m rad )m rad for Page Curve of evaporating asymptotic flat black holes. Our theory from entanglement now overcomes several major criticisms towards Verlinde's original entropic force proposal, and can co-exist with Susskind's Complexity Tendency.",

The major difference is that the momentum stays the same dp d\u03bb = 0 (4. 16) during the quasi-static process (or more accurate, the average momentum value stays the same). What's more, in the end of last section, we argue that our entropic mechanism can also work in AdS/CFT, even for gravitational force in pure AdS. To explain the gravitational force in pure AdS, one may use \u2206 K A since there is no temperature and the states in entire AdS are pure. Even more, through virtual quasi-static processes, we may be able to finally connect those two descriptions. The possible treatment may rely on chaining one more quasi-static process to give back the extracted gravity part dW g into momentum part dW p following fixed-frequency process in a time dt necessary to moving dr, with no net effect in total dW g + dW p = 0 (4.17) d\u2206S = 0 (4. 18) In this way, the entropic gradient transforms into complexity (operator growth) while gravitational potential energy transforms into momentum through virtual intermedia states in the entropic mechanism.",

They include: Jan de Boer, Janet Ling-Yan Hung, Bartek Czech, Yu-Sen An, Shan-Ming Ruan, Zhenbin Yang, Ellis Ye Yuan, Huajia Wang, Gui Pimentel, Shira Chapman, Ben Freivogel, Adolfo Toloza, Bo Feng, Erik Verlinde for useful discussion and feedbacks. And we do encourage people around world to cooperate together against Coronavirus without prejudice, as people doing now in science.YA is at a stage requiring for potential visiting cooperation and future position offers to promote relevant research. Welcome to contact us even just for exchanging ideas.",
