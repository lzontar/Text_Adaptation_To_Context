We constructed mixed-effects logistic regression models to study the association between environmental factors and bat hunting activity at the household level. To build models, we first framed a causal diagram to identify associations between variables of interest and to identify confounders (Greenland et al., 1999) . We constructed mixed-effects models consisting of a single independent variable controlling for village clustering as a random effect. The presence of bat hunting at the household level was used as the dependent variable and the presence of bat roosts on the landowner's property, the presence of bats within the household complex and courtyards, the total number of fruit trees on the property, the dominance of trees which were highly attractive to fruit bats around the household, the number of Pteropus bats per square kilometre and population in the village, and two measures of household wealth were all identified as independent variables. To create a variable representing the attractiveness of fruit tress surrounding a household to fruit bats, we used tree counts and the report of bat visits to specific tree varieties provided by household heads. We designated fruit tree varieties with 90% or more of tree owners reporting bat visits as highly attractive to fruit bats and we designated households dominated by these trees at two levels (making up 50% and 80% of all trees planted on the property) in the analysis. These cut-offs were selected as they represented an increasing gradient and had large enough populations in each group to allow for analysis. As proxies for household wealth (Kumar, 1989) , we used two non-colinear measures of household per capita wealth: the total number of fruit trees and the total number of livestock (which included cattle, buffalo, sheep, pigs, goats and horses) per number of people living in the compound.

Because fruit trees provide food for both animals and people, villagers may take steps to protect their fruit trees against frugivorous bats. Despite these trends suggesting increased hunting when large-bodied bats roost in close proximity to villagers or threaten fruit and livestock resources, none of these variables were strong predictors of hunting activity. Bat hunting did not increase with greater bat density per square kilometre, suggesting bat hunters are also seeking out and actively targeting the animals, even in areas where bats may be less abundant.

In addition, bat hunting is much more common in Western regions of Bangladesh, even when controlling for bat population densities. This may suggest that the propensity to hunt bats in Bangladesh has social influences that vary across the country and cluster geographically. Our analysis does have limitations. While our study does suggest bat hunting is widespread, we interviewed relatively few bat hunting households. Because of this, there are limitations to our statistical inference. For example, we may be underappreciating trends, such as increased hunting with livestock ownership and with increasing ownership of mango and guava trees. Additionally, the data used in this analysis were not collected primarily for the purpose of studying bat hunting. A dedicated survey focused on bat hunting and exposures utilizing open-ended questions would provide a more thorough explication of bat-human interactions. The number of bats killed and other reasons for killing bats besides consumption and medicinal uses are missing from our data set. Questions regarding the frequency of bats hunted and killed for sport or for pest control are also notably missing from our survey. While we know that bat hunting is widespread, we do not know how many individuals participate in hunting. Nor do we have an understanding of the financial rewards of hunting or extent of markets where hunted bats might be sold.
