This is widely criticised as a hastily taken step with political inclination and minimal evidence backing. In the current scenario, where there is mass fear against COVID-19, this recommendation has made the people to believe that it will kill the viruses.",

A study among hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Marseille, France showed significant reduction/disappearance in viral load with HCQ and azithromycin treatment. 13 However, these results are widely debated due to some methodological issues primarily related to smaller sample size, unmeasured viral load in a majority of the control cohort and non-randomized nature of the trial which might end up cherry picking patients, potentially biasing the results. A randomized trial of HCQ in 30 COVID confirmed patients in China yielded no better clinical benefit compared to the control arm which received standard treatment. 14 Another prospective single-arm study of 11 hospitalized patients in France treated with HCQ and azithromycin (same dosing regimen reported by Gautret et al. 13 ) showed no evidence of viral clearance or clinical benefit with one death and two transferred to the Intensive Care Unit. In another patient, treatment regimen was discontinued after 4 days due to QT prolongation. 15 On the other hand, a preliminary result from a trial from 10 hospitals in China involving 100 patients demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in preventing the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course. 16 Thus, although the intention was to protect the high-risk groups from getting infected, the delivery of the message and implementation could have been better. Rather than discouraging this move by the ICMR, I think all health care workers taking this drug should volunteer themselves to be part of a trial or an observational study to generate evidence related to its safety and efficacy and guide future recommendations. This could have been planned as a multicentric trial or a large observational study with an online recruitment platform where health staff could register and fill their sociodemographic and clinical details, details regarding drug intake and its side effects, COVID exposure and infection. The other risk group which includes asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients are under active surveillance by",

A recent meta-analysis by Phulen et al. showed no difference in virological cure, death, clinical worsening of disease and safety when compared to the control/conventional treatment arm, although more robust data is needed to reach a definite conclusion. 19 Accepted Article rheumatoid arthritis). Anecdotal findings and media reports suggest that there is in fact acute shortage of the drug in several parts of the country probably due to artificial scarcity created by drug traders as a result of hoarding and panic buying by customers. However, the government was quick to react and placed the drug under the Schedule H category in order to restrict the sale and distribution of the drug. Although the ICMR warned against any false sense of protection as a result of intake of the drug, this is inevitable and runs the risk of downplaying public health measures such as social distancing, use of masks and sanitizers etc. There are also concerns regarding the dosage of the drug to be given, its side effects and the evidence behind it. The dosage schedule recommended by the ICMR also has no support from the literature. Even though some trials are underway on the post-and pre-exposure chloroquine prophylaxis for health care workers and asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, the dosages being tested in the trials are different from those recommended by the ICMR (Clinical Trial Registry Number: NCT04331834, NCT04308668 and NCT04318444 registered with ClinicalTrials.gov). Hospitals and state governments around the country have been implementing ICMR's recommendations in different ways. For example, healthcare workers in several states were given the drug without screening for risk factors. Many individual doctors orother healthcare workers are also popping the drug on their own. In contrast, a government medical college in Kerala evaluated all individuals taking the drug for risks including an ECG to look for heart-related abnormalities.",
