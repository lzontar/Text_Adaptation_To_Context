In order to elucidate the presence of this association, this paper analyzed six specific cohort studies within China to synthesize the relevant evidence. The rationale for papers only chosen within China is due to COVID-19 originating in China. China in turn, has an extensive amount of research completed on COVID-19 in comparison to any other countries worldwide. The analysis was carried out to identify whether gender differences in smoking have an effect on the severity of the symptoms on the current coronavirus strain, COVID-19, by gathering data and calculating the odds ratios for the selected cohorts. The analysis of the data extracted from these studies indicated that patients with a smoking history were approximately 2 times (OR=1.92; 95% CI= 1.036-1.883) as likely to suffer from severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19 compared to patients without a smoking history. However, there was a lack of evidence available on the differences in gender and their smoking rates. From the six cohorts in China, the smoking data for a total of 1343 males and 1000 females was analyzed. A higher proportion of males suffer from more severe symptoms of COVID-19 within China, as observed in the six cohorts where 158 more males suffered from severe cases (25%) in comparison to severe female cases (18.7%). Simultaneously, it was observed that males had a higher prevalence of smoking in comparison to females both within China (54% male smokers and 2.6% female smokers) (23) . This observation supports our hypothesis that a higher proportion of men suffer from severe manifestations, as compared to females, due to the higher prevalence of smoking amongst men in China. Similarly, other countries badly affected by COVID-19, such as Italy have found that males (22.8%) are more likely to smoke in comparison to females (14.9%) (24).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1604, "end": 1608, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Furthermore, it was observed that within the Italian population, 58% of the COVID-19 cases were male cases (25) .

As observed in Italy, a cohort study could demonstrate a negative association between smoking and severity of Covid-19 (26) . This indicates that further research is necessary before any association is determined in Ireland. However, while there are no studies to support the evidence, data published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, states that although males account for only 46% of confirmed cases, they account for 71% of deaths, which is a severe outcome (29) . This observation has an essential public health implication, as it could be used as the driving force for an amendment in the existing Irish Smoking Ban. In 2004, Ireland imposed a blanket ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces as well as workplaces. But this ban did not extend to open public spaces, such as parks, beaches, playgrounds, and campuses, or include the use of electronic cigarettes (30) . In order to reduce the smoking associated gender specific disease burden, amending the current smoking ban to restrict smoking in open public places and ban the use of ecigarettes might be necessary to reduce the incidence of severe cases of COVID-19 in the Irish population, thus decreasing the burden on the healthcare services.
