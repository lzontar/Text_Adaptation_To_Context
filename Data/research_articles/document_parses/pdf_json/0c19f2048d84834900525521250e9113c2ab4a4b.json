Despite the cat's obvious weakness and muscle atrophy, its appreciation of tactile stimuli and proprioceptive information appeared unimpaired, suggesting that motor axons were affected more than sensory afferents. About 20 per cent of humans with chronic relapsing polyneuropathy are affected in this manner. Perhaps this sparing of muscle spindle afferents provides an explanation for the only discordant feature of the case, the persistence of the patellar reflex despite severe motor axon dysfunction. Unfortunately sensory conduction studies, which may have provided information to support this contention were not performed.
