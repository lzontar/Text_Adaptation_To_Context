Baracchini et al. [5] observed a reduction of 26% in IVT and 30% in MT, as well as onset-to-door and door-to-treatment times for major strokes. They also note a 50% reduction in minor strokes, transient ischaemic attacks and transfers from primary stroke units. The authors do not provide further details for these findings and the number of stroke unit admissions and study periods are not specified. In the editorial of Morelli et al. [6] the authors note a marked reduction in emergency admissions with symptoms of acute strokeonly six admissions between 21 February and 25 March 2020, compared to a monthly average of 51 cases in previous years. Several factors could potentially explain this phenomenon. First, some patients with milder neurological symptoms might delay or avoid medical consultation due to fear of contamination. This could potentially account for a reduction in stroke alerts but less so in IVT or MT, as patients in this group generally do not have mild deficits. Secondly, care systems, and in particular pre-hospital and hospital emergency services, are undergoing significant pressures due to the volume of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, protocols are burdened by personal protection measures across all phases of patient care. This might induce supplemental delays or errors during patient triage and transport, thus reducing the proportion of patients eligible for acute treatments. In our region, stroke care and interventional treatments remained available around the clock; the effects of the outbreak could potentially become even more significant if stroke pathways are affected or even interrupted by illness amongst the medical personnel or redistribution to other departments. Albeit not statistically significant, in our study longer in-hospital delays were observed for patients who underwent IVT or MT. This is probably explained by additional anamnesis and clinical examination needed in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection, as well as by the additional personal protection measures taken to avoid contamination of medical personnel.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 77, "end": 80, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 496, "end": 499, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Thirdly, epidemic response measures might also represent a contributing factor.
