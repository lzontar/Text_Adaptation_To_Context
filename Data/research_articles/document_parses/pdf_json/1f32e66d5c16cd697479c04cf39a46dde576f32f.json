They can help assess and develop preparedness, gather evidence and experience, advise and support leadership, remind everyone that there is no patient safety without staff safety, leverage organizational learning, and connect with experts and patient partners. These activities will help enable compassion, safety and respect to emerge from the midst of the turbulence. In the coming months, QI and PS resourcefulness will also be invaluable to help manage the impact on other patients whose treatment is delayed, interrupted or cancelled, in terms of both the immediate disruption and the ensuing process of further organizational change to repair our damaged health services and the many affected patients and families, both with and without COVID-19.",
