The wide adoption of IoT devices, sensors and actuators in manufacturing environments has fostered an increasing research interest on real-time data analytics. However, these approaches face several challenges in real-life scenarios: (i) They require a large amount of sensor data that already have experienced events (e.g. failures of -ideally-all possible causes); (ii) They require an enormous computational capacity that cannot be supported by existing computational infrastructure of factories; (iii) In most cases, the sensor data involve only a few components of a production line, or a small number of parameters related to each component (e.g. temperature, pressure, vibration), making impossible to capture the whole picture of the factory shop floor and the possible correlations among all the machines; (iv) The cold-start problem is rarely investigated. On the other hand, there is a huge treasure of legacy, enterprise and operational systems data remaining untouched.

Intelligent and automated data analysis which aims to discover useful insights from data has become a best practice for modern factories. It is supported today by many software tools and data warehouses, and it is known by the name \"descriptive analytics\". A step further, however, is to use the same data to feed models that can make predictions with similar or better accuracy than a human expert. In the framework of smart manufacturing, prognostics related to machines' health status is a critical research domain that often leverages machine learning methods and data mining tools. In most of the cases, this is related to the analysis of streaming sensor data mainly for health monitoring [7] [8] [9] , but also for failure prediction [10] [11] [12] as part of a predictive maintenance strategy. However, in all of these approaches, the prediction is produced only minutes or even seconds before the actual failure, which, is not often a realistic and practical solution for a real industrial case. The factory managers need to have this information hours or days before the event, so that there is enough time for them to act proactively and prevent it. One way to achieve this is to perform data mining on maintenance and operational data that capture the daily life-cycle of the shop floor in order to make more high-level predictions [13] [14] [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 707, "end": 710, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 711, "end": 714, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 715, "end": 718, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 758, "end": 762, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1360, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1365, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1370, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Predictive Analytics for Smart Manufacturing"}, {"text": "Existing Challenges.

This type of data usually contains daily characteristics that derive from the production line operations and are typically collected as part of a world-wide best practice for monitoring, evaluation and improvement of the effectiveness of the production process. The basic measurement of this process is an industry standard known as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and is computed as: OEE(%) = Availability(%) \u00c2 Performance(%) \u00c2 Quality (%). Availability is the ratio of actual operational time versus the planned operational time, Performance is the ratio of actual throughput of products versus the maximum potential throughput, and the Quality is the ratio of the not-rejected items produced vs the total production.

Cold rolling is a process of reduction of the cross-sectional area through the deformation caused by a pair of rotating in opposite directions metal rolls in order to produce rolling products with the closest possible thickness tolerances and an excellent surface finish. In the milling station, there is one pair of back up rolls and one pair of work rolls. The deformation takes place through force of the rolls supported by adjustable strip tension in both coilers and de-coilers.

J. Maillis S.A. factory for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The datasets included a total of 21 features and some of the most useful were the real operational time, the time of interruptions and the duration of the breakdown events. A multivariate time series model was designed, as several input features were used in order to predict one output feature. To this direction, the first time series analysis performed in order to predict when the next interruption will occur ('When do we expect the next interruption?'). A new feature named 'Days from next breakdown event' was created, and the model was trained. The input features selected for this prediction were: Availability, Performance, Minutes of Breakdown, Minutes of Interruptions, Real Gross Production and the date. After preprocessing the data, the appropriate sequences were extracted that would allow for several timesteps to be selected and tested for the analysis. In our case, timestep represented the last \"n\" days that the model will use. The LSTM model was then created by testing several layers, optimizers, neurons, batch sizes and epochs until the best performing model was designed. The final result ended being a sequential model with a first LSTM layer of 32 neurons, a second LSTM layer of 16 neurons, a dropout layer with rate 0.1, and finally a dense layer. The model was then trained using data from 2017, 2018 and six months of 2019; with an rmsprop optimizer, a batch size of 1, a timestep of 1, an epochs value of 300, and an early stopping that reached the best performance around 100 epochs. Predictions deal with the last six months of 2019, and the result can be seen inFig. 4. The blue line represents the actual values and the orange line represents the predicted values. The RMSE came to be 1.26, meaning that there is an average of 1.26 days uncertainty in every result predicted.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "LSTM result -prediction of when the next interruption will occur.
