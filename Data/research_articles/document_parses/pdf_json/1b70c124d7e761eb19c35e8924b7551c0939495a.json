From available data, children appeared to be slightly affected by SARS-CoV-2, a feature resembling that of SARS-CoV emerged 17 years ago. 18 However, the relatively low attack rate of COVID-19 in children could be explained by the stringent implementation of home confinement and prolonged school closure during the outbreak as required by the Chinese governments. Whether it is also the case during school year is hard to tell. One distinct feature of pediatric cases is that the majority of them are infected through household contact with adult patients. 10,19e23 As with all new diseases, many characteristics of COVID-19 still remain unknown. There is a paucity of data to support the notion that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection or virus transmission is less effective among them. Viral RNA has been constantly detected in stool samples and anal swabs collected from confirmed cases of COVID-19. 6,12,24e27 In one study, fecal specimens from 9 (53%) of 17 patients were positive for nucleic acid testing, although viral loads of the stool were less than those of respiratory samples. 26 Presence of SARS-CoV-2 was even detected in environmental samples taken from the surface of toilet bowl and sink in infection isolation rooms. 28 Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in stools of infected patients as demonstrated by some case reports. 16 Evidence so far indicates the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted through contaminated fomites.
