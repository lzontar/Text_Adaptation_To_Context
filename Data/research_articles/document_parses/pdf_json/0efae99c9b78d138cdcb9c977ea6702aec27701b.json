            "text": "successful vaccines for major targets such as malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have yet to be established, [1] and the recent Zika virus outbreak highlights the need for ongoing vaccine development. [2] Related to this, there is a global rise in antimicrobial resistance, and so relying on medication alone to treat a disease once contracted is not a guaranteed option. [3] Thus, continued vaccine development is still an important area of both basic and applied research. [4] Traditional vaccines, based on the administration of killed or attenuated organisms or their purified components, have proven to be among the most effective methods for disease prevention. [5] However, a number of safety issues relating to the production and administration of these vaccines limit their universal application, including the risk of reversion to a virulent organism; decreased or altered immune response after inactivation; the possibility of causing disease in immune compromised individuals; and the requirement to maintain the cold chain. [6] Recent advances in the identification of single components (antigens) capable of generating protective immunity have driven the development of subunit vaccines, where instead of using whole pathogens, specific portions are delivered using a scaffold. [7] Furthermore, improved genetic methods and expression systems have resulted in cheaper and large-scale production of recombinant microbial antigens without the need to culture highly pathogenic infectious agents. [8] Despite these advantages, recombinant subunit vaccines are often less immunogenic than their traditional whole-organism counterparts. To overcome decreased immunogenicity, subunit vaccines require the addition of immunostimulatory agents, i.e., adjuvants, [9] or optimization of delivery systems that specifically target immune cells and tailor immune responses. [10] Another key strategy for subunit vaccine design is to create a multivalent platform enabling the expression of multiple antigens in a repetitive array. [11] Having a delivery system with several copies of T and B-cell antigens from different strains of the pathogen could generate cross-protective immunity and increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine. If required, these platforms could be adapted to display both antigens and immunopotentiators, such as Toll-like receptor agonists, [12] thus enhancing the activity, uptake, and presentation of antigens to the immune",

Nonetheless, system. Adopting strategies that direct antigen delivery and release may stimulate more potent immune responses using lower doses of weak immunogens. Reducing the need for the prime and boost strategies often required in conventional vaccination regimens would lead to dose-sparing, beneficial for reducing development cost and improving immunization efficiency schedules in the event of vaccine shortages. [13] Subunit vaccine delivery systems typically include the use of liposomes, [14] virus-like particles, [15] or peptide nanoparticles. [16] The rationale is that these mimic the size and shape of viruses to simulate an immune response similar to a live attenuated vaccine, while maintaining the selectivity of a subunit vaccine. Protein engineering and design approaches, in particular, provide increased synthetic access and control of components, [17] with one example being the self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) platform. [18] SAPNs comprise trimeric and pentameric \u03b1-helical coiled-coil motifs linked in a single peptide. These polypeptides assemble into particles \u224820 nm in diameter. They have been optimized to act as vaccine carriers, and their biodistribution in vivo has been monitored. [19] They can serve as repetitive antigen displays capable of inducing a variety of immune responses, and include particles modified with epitopes derived from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, [20] malaria, [21] HIV, [22] and influenza virus. [12b] Other peptide-based self-assembling systems with potential as functionalized structures take on the form of nanofibers, or tubes, rather than resembling viral capsid architecture. [23] These assemblies exploit the thermal stability [24] and environmental responsiveness [25] of synthetic peptide systems, along with dose control [26] and the incorporation of whole-protein antigens. [27] Such examples demonstrate the potential of synthetic peptide and protein-based vaccine delivery platforms.",

            "text": "The work described herein explores the potential of selfassembling peptide cages (SAGEs) to act as modular scaffolds in a synthetic biology approach for antigen delivery. SAGEs are made from de novo \u03b1-helical coiled-coil peptides. Specifically, a set of homotrimeric (CC-Tri3) and heterodimeric (CC-Di-A and CC-Di-B) peptides is linked via a disulfide bond to form two complementary hubs. [28] Mixing of these hubs in aqueous solution leads to co-assembly into hexagonal lattices, [29] ultimately folding into spherical particles \u2248100 nm in diameter (Figure 1a) . The working hypothesis of SAGE architecture is that each CC-Tri3 unit is oriented within the peptide lattice such that its N terminus faces the exterior of the particle and its C terminus faces the interior, while CC-Di-A and CC-Di-B have greater freedom of rotation around the disulfide bond. [28, 30] Subsequently, functionality can be incorporated via CC-Tri3 to allow for bespoke dose delivery as the antigen dose is controlled via peptide synthesis and conjugation rather than passive encapsulation. [31] The fully synthetic SAGE appears to withstand relatively robust functionalization, [31a] can be predictably modified to alter cellular uptake, [31b] and the modularity of the system allows for fine control of modification. [29] SAGEs are potentially an alternative platform for developing subunit vaccines with the following advantages. Their modularity means that by mixing different ratios of the hub building blocks we can incorporate multiple antigens, thus tailoring the immune response. Furthermore, the nature of the SAGE structure provides a multivalent platform that can potentially be used to deliver multiple antigens from different strains, thereby increasing antigen immunogenicity. Another important consideration is component stability. The hub building blocks can be lyophilized and stored as powder long-term, which could also be a benefit to such a platform by avoiding problems associated Figure 1 . SAGE assembly and design of functionalized hubs. a) Schematic representation of parent SAGE assembly. Linking the heterodimer to the homotrimer forms complementary hubs that, when mixed, self-assemble into a lattice and close to form particles \u2248100 nm in diameter (as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM); scale bar = 1 \u00b5m). b) Cartoons representing incorporation of different model antigenic peptides into hubs. Model antigenic peptides (gray ovals) can be incorporated either N-or C-terminal to the trimer, or at both termini.",

            "text": "The source of this proliferation was further probed by assaying the SAGE components, both the building blocks (HubA and HubB) and their constituent peptide components (CC-Tri3, CC-Di-A, and CC-Di-B). Their ability to stimulate proliferation of PBMCs was assayed ( Figure 3c ) along with an immunological memory response in human and mouse sera (Figure 3d ,e). The proliferative response to SAGEs was not found to be due to any particular peptide component. We posit that SAGEs may induce this response due to their shape, size, and local concentration. From these results, it is proposed that the ability of SAGEs to prompt low-level immune responses would be beneficial for their development as a vaccine delivery platform, potentially in a similar manner to that employed by conjugate vaccines. [36] SAGE toxicity in vivo was also assayed by immunizing mice with extreme doses of parent SAGE. BALB/c mice were immunized with four doses (350 \u00b5g) of parent SAGE, each dose at an interval of 3 weeks (2 weeks for the final immunization). Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, used to evaluate liver function, were comparable between SAGE-immunized (five mice) and control (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) only, three mice) animals (Figure 3f ), and immunization did not lead to an alteration in percentage lymphocyte and monocyte population numbers in peripheral blood ( Figure S10 , Supporting Information). Immunized mice did not develop any injection site reactions or adverse systemic effects, and in combination with the lack of histopathological changes (Table S6 , Supporting Information) these data suggest SAGEs are not toxic in vivo.",

After establishing that parent SAGEs are nontoxic but potentially immunogenic/mitogenic, we explored whether immune phagocytes internalize and are primed by SAGE particles. Human PBMCs were purified and differentiated into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and macrophages (MDMs). To monitor the cellular uptake of particles, 5% of the hub building blocks were replaced with fluorescently labeled counterparts to assemble FITC SAGE (Tables S1-S3, Supporting Information). Cellular uptake was quantified by flow cytometry, isolating internalized fluorescence by quenching external fluorescence with trypan blue (Figure 4) . Both MDDCs and MDMs took up SAGEs with similar kinetics, with the greatest rate of uptake in the first 60 min. However, MDMs had a greater overall uptake of SAGEs compared to MDDCs. Although MDDCs and MDMs are both known to be phagocytic cells, the uptake of nanoparticles can be influenced by particle size and aggregation state and, additionally, the maturation state of the cells, [37] which may explain the differences in SAGE uptake observed. Next, we investigated whether phagocytes were activated after SAGE uptake as determined by the increased secretion of a range of cytokines and the increased surface expression of co-stimulatory and antigen presenting molecules. MDDCs and MDMs were cultured with SAGEs, followed by the analysis of cell-surface markers and cytokines in the cell-culture supernatants. Cytokine secretion by MDDCs and MDMs was not induced by SAGEs, while treatment of the cells with the positive control of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased the amounts of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IL-1\u03b1 secreted ( Figure S11a , Supporting Information). While phagocytic cells were shown to upregulate the co-stimulatory molecule CD80, and MHC class I and II expression was observed, these effects were moderate in comparison to the effects of LPS ( Figure S11b , Supporting Information).",

FITC SAGE-TT were taken up as effectively as parent SAGEs after 120 min, while TT-FITC SAGE and TT-FITC-SAGE-TT were taken up significantly less well by this timepoint (Figure 5a ). By the final timepoint, constructs with TT functionality at the N-terminus of CC-Tri3 were internalized by MDDCs less rapidly than those functionalized at the C-terminus.

PBMC proliferation is indicative of a T cell response and, in this case, considered to be a CD4 + T cell response against the TT peptide, a model CD4 + T cell epitope. [38] Experimental controls of parent SAGE, free TT peptide, and parent SAGE mixed with free TT peptide elicited low levels of cellular proliferation. TT-SAGE and SAGE-TT have an equivalent amount of TT as both parent SAGE + TT and free TT peptide in the controls. The amount of SAGE peptide is equivalent for all constructs and controls, and so TT-SAGE-TT has double the amount of TT relative to its singly functionalized counterparts. Two of the constructs, TT-SAGE-TT and SAGE-TT, induced a significantly greater proliferative response than free TT peptide. The doubly functionalized TT-SAGE-TT induced higher proliferative responses than those singly functionalized, though this difference was not significant. Here, the N-terminal functionality in TT-SAGE-TT is suspected of affecting its internalization. Despite delivering the same dosage, there was a significant difference in the response to TT-SAGE and SAGE-TT. We conclude that the less effective uptake of TT-SAGE impacts the downstream antigen-specific proliferative response.",

Following the promising results observed with TT-SAGE-TT, two copies of the OVA epitope were conjugated to CC-Tri3 to increase the delivered dose. BALB/c mice were primed on d0 and boosted on d21 with a 160 \u00b5g dose of OVA, either in the form of OVA-functionalized SAGE or free OVA peptide. The free peptide was delivered both with and without Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), in addition to a further control group immunized with parent SAGE. Splenocyte proliferation was monitored as a measure of T cell proliferation, [39] in this case that of CD4 + T cells in response to the OVA antigen. Splenocytes from mice given SAGE in any form were able to generate an anti-SAGE proliferative response when restimulated with SAGE ex vivo ( Figure 6c ) and produced anti-SAGE antibodies (Figure 6d) . A low-level anti-SAGE antibody response was also observed in mice immunized with OVA + CFA, despite not receiving SAGE in any form. We believe this was due to the use of the adjuvant, resulting in an overall higher concentration of antibodies in the sera, and in turn a low level of nonspecific binding. In parallel, splenocytes were also restimulated ex vivo with OVA peptide (Figure 6e ). Mice given free OVA peptide with CFA mounted the strongest anti-OVA proliferative response, which is expected from the use of the adjuvant. However, the response against free OVA peptide without CFA was enhanced by immunizing with an equivalent dose in the form of OVA-functionalized SAGE particles. Mice given OVA-functionalized SAGE also produced OVA-specific antibodies (Figure 6f ). While the positive control of free OVA peptide with CFA generated the greatest antibody titers, OVAfunctionalized SAGE gave a significantly greater response than the free OVA peptide. This result demonstrates the potential of the SAGE system as a delivery platform capable of enhancing an immune response when compared to equivalent amounts of the free immunogenic peptide.",

[40] SAGEs were functionalized with a single copy of HA at just the C terminus of CC-Tri3, as MHC class I processing is more specific than the MHC class II so far tested and positioning of the epitope has more of an effect on processing. [35] To this end, we utilized transgenic clone 4 (CL4) CD8 + T cells, which express a high-affinity T cell receptor (TcR) for the HA epitope. Accordingly, magnetic-activated cell sorting-purified na\u00efve CL4 CD8 + T cells were labeled with the proliferation marker CellTrace Violet (CTV). As the CTV-labeled (CTV-CL4) cells divide after priming, daughter cells will contain less of the label and so will become distinguishable from undivided, fully labeled unprimed CTV-CL4 cells. Na\u00efve BALB/c mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with purified CTV-CL4 cells. Mice were simultaneously immunized subcutaneously (s.c.) with either the HA peptide alone or SAGE-HA at 200 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m or 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m (delivering 19 or 188 ng of HA per mouse, respectively) to establish an appropriate dose. The use of transgenic T cells allowed for greatly reduced doses compared to previous experiments, as these cells are primed to respond to this particular epitope. After 3 d, the CTV-labeled CL4 cells (CTV-CL4) were isolated from the spleens of these mice, and the extent of proliferation was determined by flow cytometric analyses of CTV expression. The data show that in mice immunized with HA peptide alone, CL4 T cells proliferated in response to both concentrations of the peptide. This is evidenced by a shift of CTV-labeled cells to the left of the panel as a result of the loss of CTV (Figure 7a) . However, in mice immunized with SAGE-HA there was even greater CL4 T cell proliferation, at both concentrations, compared with mice immunized with HA peptide alone. This is evidenced by the appearance of a discrete population of highly divided cells (Figure 7a ; left of the dashed line). Indeed, further analyses with either the HA peptide or with SAGE-HA (both at 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m) showed that there was a significant increase in the percentage of these highly divided cells in mice immunized with SAGE-HA compared with immunization of HA alone (Figure 7b) .",

To build on the observed antigen-specific CD4 + T cell and B cell responses, we incorporated a CD8 + T cell epitope from the influenza virus hemagglutinin into the SAGE architecture via an extended peptide to enhance epitope delivery (HA). By adoptive transfer we assayed the proliferative response of transgenic T cells primed to recognize this epitope. We are encouraged by the increased response relative to free HA peptide and believe that the added ability to enhance a CD8 + T cell response gives the system potential as a vaccine scaffold. With further optimization, we anticipate exploiting the modularity of the system to target multiple branches of the immune system to protect against a challenge. This might take the form of particles comprising hubs with multiple antigenic functionalities, or the use of whole protein functionality to increase the immunogenic response. Lyophilization of particles functionalized with whole proteins must then be investigated, as the work described herein has used antigenic peptides, demonstrated to withstand this process.",

Based on the stricter processing of MHC class I antigens reflected in the work by de Haan et al., [35] the HA epitope was only incorporated C-terminally in SAGEs. However, SAGES were functionalized with TT and OVA both N and C-terminally to allow for comparison of the effects of antigen positioning on downstream immune responses. The in vitro experiments with TT-functionalized SAGEs suggested that N-terminal functionalization decreased the uptake of SAGE, leading to a diminished ability to stimulate CD4 + T cell proliferation. By contrast, SAGEs functionalized N-terminally with OVA stimulated a stronger CD4 + T cell proliferative response, but weaker antibody response compared to SAGEs functionalized C-terminally with OVA. While OVAfunctionalized SAGE uptake by APCs has not been explored in as much detail as with TT functionality, these results suggest that N-terminal OVA does not affect uptake levels in the same way that N-terminal TT does, as measured by downstream immune responses. We know from biophysical characterization that OVA functionality leads to the formation of larger particles and has a potentially destabilizing effect on component trimerization, and so it would be of interest to further probe the mechanism of internalization. Whether functionalization affects particle recognition and cellular uptake due to surface charge, differences in particle size, or aggregation remains to be identified.",

The modularity of SAGEs means there is future potential for optimization in terms of charge, shape, and size to drive the ideal antigen-specific response. In addition, the display of antigenic components can take the form of peptides or proteins, [31a] whether linear, conformational, or conjugated, to best promote the uptake, delivery, and presentation of viral or bacterial antigens to the immune system. To date we have demonstrated that SAGE particles can act as successful scaffolds for the presentation of immunogenic peptide components, while maintaining their ability to self-assemble. We now seek to explore whether SAGEs can be used as a novel delivery system to drive further antigen-specific responses, and whether functionalizing with whole proteins helps to strengthen these responses. Finally, whether with continued peptide functionality or with whole proteins, the next important step will be to use SAGEs as a scaffold to effectively protect against an infection challenge.",
