For nine patients we analyzed EGFR and Proteinuria before and after switch with a follow-up more than 12 months: 7 showed stabilization or improvement of EGFR. Treatment was stopped in two patients because proteinuria closes to nephrotic rate. For the other 11 patients : seven needed to stop treatment due to secondary effects. Conclusions: mTor inhibitor treatment seems to be associated with a GFR stabilization. Nevertheless, these results must be confi rmed and validated by prospective studies in bigger cohorts. One patient (ID 1) was switched one year post transplantation to sirolimus, prednisone and low dose of Tinmun because of secondary effects of tacrolimus (severe tremor). Initial doses of T-Inmun were 0.15 mg/kg/d, and were adjusted to maintain trough plasma levels between 10-15 ng/mL in the fi rst year after transplantation and 5-10 ng/mL thereafter. To date, no rejection episodes have been observed and all patients have a stable renal function. Two have controlled arterial hypertension. None has developed proteinuria, hyperglicemia or hyperkalemia. Conclusions: T-Inmun has been a safe and effi cient immunosuppressive drug in this little group of children with renal transplant.",

            "text": "Objectives: Anatomical malformations of the kidney and urinary tract (UT) account for 17% of pediatric renal transplantations (Tx). HSPs activates innate immunity through toll-like receptor (TLR)4. HSPA1B A(1267)G polymorphism leads to lower HSP72 mRNA and is associated with kidney diseases in adults and children. TLR4 A(896)G polymorphism is associated with a higher risk of infections. Methods: HSPA1A G(190)C, HSPA1B A(1267)G and TLR4 A(896)G polymorphisms were analyzed in 41 pediatric Tx recipients, 103 children with recurrent UT infections and 235 healthy controls (CON) . Clinical data were also evaluated. Results: HSPA1B (1267)GG genotype and (1267)G allele were more frequent in Tx (p=0.014; p=0.011) and in UTI (p=0.0001) vs. CON. HSPA1B (1267)GG and (1267)G allele were associated with higher risk of renal scarring after UTI (p=0.012 and 0.049). VUR was associated with a higher incidence of HSPA1B (1267)GG genotype in Tx (p=0.007). TLR4 (896)AG genotype and (896)G allele were more frequent in UTI vs. CON (p=0.031; 0,041), while there was no difference in Tx. TLR4 (896)G was more often in UTI without VUR vs. UTI with VUR (p=0.03). Conclusions: HSPA1B (1267)G allele might be a risk for UTI, VUR and infl uences the development of renal scarring and ESRD leading to Tx.TLR4 (896)G allele might be associated with UTI independently of other renal abnormalities. These fi ndings raise further questions about the clinical relevance of these polymorphisms in pediatric nephrology. Supported by OTKA, ETT,TAMOP.",

Bitzan. 1 1 Pediatrics, McGill Univ, Montreal, QC, Canada; 2 Mashhad Univ of Med Sciences, Mashhad, Islamic Republic of Iran; 3 Urology, McGill Univ, Montreal, QC, Canada. Objectives: To review indications, complications, urine output (UO) & laboratory changes pre/post-Nx in a pediatric KT recipient cohort. Methods: From our database (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) ), we identifi ed all patients (pts) with uni-(U) or bilateral (B) native pre-KT Nx and extracted pertinent data (mean, SD, paired t-test). Results: 82 kidneys were removed from 52 pts, age 8.5 yrs, 77% male (22 U, 30 B Nx; 75% retroperitoneoscopically). Main indications: polyuria (PU;13), proteinuria (PrU;13), PU&PrU (7), frequent UTI (9), hypertension (HTN;2), Denys Drash syndrome (2) . 8/22 UNx were performed at KT, one 4 mo post KT. 12/30 with BNx had a 2-stage procedure. Complications were rare: peritoneal laceration requiring temporary PD to HD switch (1), subcutaneous emphysema (1), fl uid overload/HTN (5) , hyperkalemia (2) . UTI decreased in 7/9. Objectives: Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR) of renal transplant is now a defi ned nosologic entity. Some success has been described with the use of IVIg and Rituximab, but there is no established treatment protocol for this condition. Methods: Herein we describe our experience with 12 young patients (18+5.6yrs) with CAMR treated with IVIg and Rituximab, associated to Plasmapheresis in two cases. The median follow up post-transplantation at diagnosis of CAMR was 14 months (10-27). All patients but one presented a GFR reduction. Transplant glomerulopathy and C4d positivity were present in all biopsies. Donor specifi c antibodies were positive in 6/12 patients. Results: After the treatment only one patient improved GFR; in this patient the diagnosis of CAMR was performed after a protocol biopsy and without laboratory tests suggestive for GFR impairment. One patient had a progressive graft dysfunction, 5 needed dialysis treatment after 18 months and the last 5 maintained a stable renal function. At the end of follow up a mean GFR reduction of 8.4+9.2 ml/min was observed. Conclusions: CAMR is confi rmed to be a clinical condition with a severe outcome. The currently available treatments are not always able to reverse the CAMR. A better outcome is obtained when the treatment is well-timed and in patients with mild tubular and interstitial damages. Objectives: Childhood end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with an increased risk for early adulthood cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Increased left ventricular mass (LVM) is an early indicator of this high risk. Previous studies suggested that in children LVM decreases after renal transplantation however, trends have been inconsistent. Our objective was to evaluate the longitudinal effect of transplantation on LVM, in children with ESRD. Methods: In our centre, children routinely undergo echocardiograms prior to transplant and yearly thereafter. LVMI values from these measurements, starting pre-transplant and annually post-transplant, were averaged among included patients. Results: Twenty seven children were followed for a median period of 5 years.",

Methods: We evaluated three children who received live related kidney transplant and were on steroid free (SF) protocol. All of them received 2 doses of IL2RA as induction. They were given IV Methylprednisolone in an initial dose 500 mg followed by oral prednisolone which was stopped on day 5. All of them received Tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg) and MMF (1100 mg/m2) as maintenance immunosuppression. We compared these 3 children with three other children who received steroid based protocol during the same time period. The outcome measures that were evaluated were number of acute rejections, graft loss, PTDM, antihypertensive medications, S. Cholestrol, eGFR, height velocity and height SDS.",

The potential inhibitory growth effects of SRL may be offset by avoidance of CNI nephrotoxicity and better graft function. PATIENT Conclusions: More potent immunosuppressive agents have improved graft outcomes but led to an increase in infections in the paediatric renal transplant population. Our 5 patients failed to respond to conventional antibiotic therapy for recurrent or persistent respiratory infections that required extensive investigation, prolonged antimicrobial treatment, and MMF withdrawal. Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; 2 Pathology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan. Objectives: The therapeutic benefi ts of Cyclosporine A (CsA) are often limited by the chronic nephrotoxicity of its long-term use.Chronic nephrotoxicity is manifested by renal function impairment and progressive histopathological kidney lesions characterized by tubular vacuolization, tubular necrosis, interstitial fi brosis, and afferent arteriolopathy. This study tested the hypothesis that the concurrent administration of Mizoribine (MZR) may improve chronic CsA nephrotoxicity. Methods: Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided into the following four groups: group 1, control (n = 6); group 2, treated with CsA alone (n = 5); group 3, treated with CsA and MZR (n = 4); and group 4, treated with MZR alone (n = 6). The anti-infl ammatory and antifi brotic effects of MZR were studied by evaluating the concentrations of the infl ammatory mediator, osteopontin, renal function, and histopathology. The interstitial fi brosis was stained blue with Elastica-Massontrichrome and the sections were quantifi ed. Results: The CsA-treated rats showed decreased renal function and increased histologic parameters in comparison with the control rats and also showed signifi cantly increased interstitial fi brosis area and macrophage in comparison with the control rats. The CsA MZR treatment signifi cantly improved the interstitial fi brosis area and macrophage in comparison with the CsA-treated rats. Conclusions: On the basis of these fi ndings, we suggest MZR effectively attenuates renal macrophage accumulation and the progression of interstitial fi brosis. Objectives: Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is the most common genetic cause of ESRD in children and adolescents. The most frequently affected gene is NPHP1 encoding for the ciliary protein nephrocystin-1. Mutations of the NPHP4 gene encoding for nephrocystin-4 account for a smaller proportion of NPHP cases, yet the clinical presentation of patients with NPHP1 or NPHP4 mutations is quite similar. The cellular function and regulation of the proteins nephrocystin-1 and nephrocystin-4 remain poorly understood. We have recently shown that nephrocystin-1 interacts with the focal adhesion kinase Pyk2. Here we show that Pyk2 induces phosphorylation of nephrocystin-1 at three defi ned tyrosine residues and that this phosphorylation regulates binding of nephrocystin-1 to the trans-golgi sorting protein PACS-1. Interestingly, fullength nephrocystin-4, but not different patient mutations, abolishes the Pyk2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of nephrocystin-1. Knockdown of nephrocystin-4 leads to changes of the subcellular localisation of nephrocystin-1 in ciliated epithelial cells.",

The dysfunction leads to low plasma and high urine concentration of dibasic amino acids. Hyperammonaemia is caused by functional impairment of the urea cycle. Clinical symptoms are variable and non specifi c leading often to misdiagnosis. Methods: We report the case of a 13 year old boy, seen in paediatric nephrology consultation after one episode of macroscopic haematuria with mild proteinuria. Results: He had no positive family history and was born after an uneventful pregnancy. Because of cataract, hepatosplenomegaly and hyperferritinemia, he had had lots of explorations for suspicion of galactosemia, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, spherocytosis and haemochromatosis. Urinary amino acid chromatography revealed increased excretion of lysine, arginine, ornithine and citrulline, subsequently plasma analysis has shown low concentration of them and urinary organic acid chromatography elevated acid orotic. Elevated levels of ferritin, liver transminases and mild leucopenia with anemia were also present. Detailed dietary history revealed aversion to protein diet.

We report the follow up of 10 children treated by long term PT. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 6 months (0.5 to 51 months). 8 patients have factor H (CFH) mutations: homozygous in 3 (quantitative defi ciency), heterozygous in 4 (type 1 -quantitative-in 1; type 2 -functional-in 3), compound (type 1 and 2) in 1. One patient has a heterozygous factor B mutation and 1 patient a heterozygous factor I (CFI) mutation (type 2), combined to an unknown risk factor. All patients received PT (fresh frozen plasma infusions in 6, plasma exchanges in 4) within the fi rst month after onset and were maintained on long term prophylactic PT. Median follow up is 31 months (5 to 67 months). All patients except 2 have had relapses during infections or PT tapering, rescued by treatment intensifi cation. All patients have a normal glomerular fi ltration rate at last follow up, except 1 with hybrid CFH (type 2) mutation. Another patient (CFI mutation) had persistent anemia after 1 year on PT, and has been switched to eculizumab therapy. Conclusions: Prophylactic PT appeared to be effi cient to prevent ESRD in 8/10 patients.

Although associated renal involvement is common it is usually mild and of favorable outcome. The tetraspan molecule CD81 is widely expressed on immune cells, but also on most stromal and epithelial cells. In B-cells it is required for signaling upon antigen recognition. Its functions on other cells are still unclear. Methods: We herein report the case of a 7-year-old girl who presents an association of severe and uncontrollable IGA glomerulonephritis, profound hypogammaglobulinemia, immunopathology and a CD81 mutation. Results: The patient is the fi rst child of consanguineous parents. At the age of 3.5 years she developed HSP. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse mesangial proliferation, crescent formation and strong deposition of IgA and C3.She also presented recurrent episodes of thrombocytopenia associated with anti-platelet antibodies and seric levels of IgG were persistently low.She was treated with repeated full course immunosuppressive therapy but progressed to end stage renal failure. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of blood showed no expression of CD19 on the patient's B-cells. Additional studies showed that all cells lacked CD81 expression. Sequencing of the CD81 gene showed a homozygous G>A substitution. Conclusions: We present the fi rst case of immunodefi ciency syndrome, due to a CD81 mutation.

Objectives: We aimed at investigating Treg/TH-17 producing cells balance in IgAN and the correlation with TLRs expression, as marker of innate immunity. Methods: Circulating mononuclear cells were isolated from 28 IgAN patients, 82% males, e-GFR 92.6\u00b146.5 ml/min, median protein/creatinine 0.2, and10 healthy controls (HC). mRNA expression of Foxp3, TH17-related factors (IL-17 and retinoid orphan nuclear receptor (RORc), TFG-beta1 and TLR 2, 4 and 7 were assessed by Taqman and normalized to Abelson gene (Abl). Results: Transcriptional levels of Foxp3 were signifi cantly lower in IgAN vs HC (0.82\u00b10.30 vs 1.05\u00b10.37, p= 0.041), while those of IL-17 and of its regulatory factor RORc were slightly, but not signifi cantly increased (IL-17 1.17\u00b11.07 vs 1.05\u00b10.41 in HC, RORc 1.25\u00b10.85 vs 1.14\u00b10.71 in HC). A signifi cant correlation was found between IL-17 and RORc mRNAs (p<0.0001). Transcriptional levels of TGF\u03b21 were similar to HC in IgAN patients and directly correlated with RORc (p=0.0015) and IL-17 (p=0.031) mRNAs. Patients with urinary protein/creatinine >1 (median 1.62) had Foxp3 levels lower than those with protein/creatinine <1, (median 0.18), p=0.06. ROR-c levels had a trend inverse correlation with e-GFR (p=0.06). Of interest, a signifi cant inverse correlation was found between Foxp3 and TLR4 expression (p= 0.022). Conclusions: These results indicate in IgAN a functional defect in Tregs, which correlated with signs of hyperactive innate immunity. TGF\u03b21 seems to favour the expansion of TH17 cells.

Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada. Objectives: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) occurs in approximately 5% of all hospitalized patients and leads to signifi cant morbidity, mortality and fi nancial costs. Infl ammation marked by recruitment of circulating leukocytes particularly neutrophils into the injured kidney is a key component of AKI caused by ischemiareperfusion injury (IRI). Recruited neutrophils exacerbate injury by releasing infl ammatory mediators. The neuronal guidance cue, Slit2 and its transmembrane receptor roundabout (Robo) prevent axonal migration during development of central nervous system. Recently, we showed that Slit2 also inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis towards diverse chemoattractants. The objectives of this study were to determine whether Slit2 affects neutrophil adhesion in an in vitro model of IRI. Methods: Human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) grown to confl uence were exposed to 1% oxygen (hypoxia), followed by variable periods of reperfusion. HUVEC were then incubated with fl uorescent labelled human neutrophil in presence or absence of Slit2. Nonadherent neutrophils were removed by washing and adherent neutrophils were counted using a fl uorescent plate reader. Results: Slit2 reduced neutrophil adhesion in a cell culture model of IRI ranging from 30 minutes to 3 hrs of re-perfusion (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our fi ndings suggest that in IRI, Slit2 inhibits neutrophil adhesion. Thus Slit2 may have a potential role in prevention and treatment of AKI.",

Aims of this study were to assess IL7 and BAFF serum levels in children with SLE and to compare with adults. Methods: IL-17 and BAFF were measured by ELISA in a prospective crosssectional cohort of 20 children (3 boys, mean\u00b1SD for age 14.7\u00b11.9 years) and 52 adults with SLE, 12 children (3 boys, 14.2\u00b13.3 years) and 38 adult controls. 13/20 children presented lupus nephritis (active in 6). Statistic Objectives: The present study was designed to estimate serum (sIL2R) levels and MDR-1 gene expression on lymphocytes in NS to elucidate relationship between there level and clinical relevance to corticosteroids therapy. Methods: We examined 40 patients with NS group A; they were 15 cases with recent onset NS and 25 known cases of NS and 20 healthy children as a control group B. We examined every patient twice 1 st with activity and 2 nd within one week of remission. Results: we found a signifi cant increase in sIL-2R level and MDR1 gene expression in patients group in comparison to control group whether in activity or remission and also they were signifi cantly higher in activity than in remission as sIL-2R was (1197.2183.3) Iu\\L in group A in activity, (791192.6) Iu\\L in remission and (44927.3) Iu\\L in control group B and MDR1 gene was (8.70.86) % in group A in activity, (6.31.4) % in remission and (2.80 .87) % in control group and p value was <0.05 in comparing groups. Levels of sIL-2R and MDR1 gene expression in different subgroups are higher in old cases than new ones both in activity and remission and relatively higher levels in steroid resistant NS than steroid sensitive ones. Conclusions: We propose using sIL2R and /or MDR1gene expression levels as early predictors of steroid resistance in NS to promote early control of disease, and as this is the fi rst report providing new insight into use of sIL2R as a predictor of steroid resistance a wide scale study is needed to determine a cut off level of sIL2R above it cytotoxic drugs are introduced.",

Vitamin D(VD) defi ciency is prevalent in CKD. We studied the effect of VDRA in a mouse model of CKD. Methods: 8-wk old c57BL/6J mice underwent 5/6 nephrectomy(N) or sham operation(S). N mice received either vehicle or paracalcitol(PC)(N-PC) (0.15 mg/ kg ip 3X per week). S mice received vehicle. N mice were fed ad lib, the other 2 groups of mice were pair-fed for 2 weeks. Results: Serum creatinine was higher in N and N-PC than in S mice(p<0.01). Serum 25-VD3 and 1,25-VD3 were lower in N mice than in S mice(p<0.01). S & N-PC mice gained more weight than N mice (p<0.01) with equal food intake. Basal metabolic rate was higher in N than S and N-PC mice(p<0.01). Effi ciency of food consumption was lower in N mice than S and N-PC mice. N mice lost both lean body mass and fat mass whereas S and N-PC mice gained lean body mass and fat mass. mRNAs of uncoupling proteins(UCP)-1 and 2, which control energy expenditure, were upregulated in both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in N compared with S and normalized in N-PC mice. mRNAs of myogenic pathway genes, IGF-I, MyoD and PAX3, were all downregulated in the skeletal muscles in N compared with S and normalized in N-PC mice. IL-6 mRNAs in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was upregulated in N compared with S and normalized in N-PC mice. Conclusions: VDRA ameliorated cachexia and reversed cytokine over-expression in a mouse model of CKD. VD defi ciency may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of infl ammation and cachexia in CKD.",

Methods: Cases included 80 children with CKD III-IV of >2 yr duration while 42 age and sex matched healthy children served as controls. All children underwent CIMT and brachial artery FMD determination using high resolution ultrasonography. Total cholesterol (Tc), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (Tg) were estimated. Results: The mean age of cases was 9.5\u00b13.4 yr. 45% were malnourished and 87% had hypertension. 35% cases had at least one abnormal lipid parameter. The mean maximum CIMT was signifi cantly higher and brachial artery FMD was signifi cantly lower in cases than in controls. Tc, Tg, LDL, VLDL were signifi cantly higher in cases than controls. Substances identifi ed as renal toxins a priori and those associated with \u226550% incidence of AKI were compared to other substances in the database. A chisquared analysis identifi ed agents associated with AKI. Results: 5332 pediatric exposures were coded with a related renal effect. The case fatality rate was >500 times greater in pediatric exposures with related renal effects than those without. There were 2711 single-substance exposures, with AKI occurring in 26% (males 56%; females 43%). The highest incidence of AKI was in 13-19 year olds (42%). The vast majority (94%) of exposures in \u226412 year olds were unintentional while for 13-19 year olds the most common reason was intentional/suspected suicide (41%). Of single-substance medication exposures with related renal effects, the highest rates of AKI occurred with acetaminophen (84%), lithium (52%), non-steroidal anti-infl ammatories (74%), and salicylates (81%). Conclusions: Substances in the database associated with high rates of AKI among children are known nephrotoxins. This is the fi rst large database study associating AKI with acetaminophen. This data will direct future areas of research aimed at prevention and early intervention of kidney injury resulting from pediatric toxic exposures. We did not fi nd any improvement in renal function nor side effects.",

Methods: Retrospective chart review of children on PD between 2004 -2008. Episodes of peritonitis, laboratory data reviewed. Number of Peritonitis Episodes per Patient Months of PD recorded for each year. Peritonitis was diagnosed >100 WBC x 10^6/litre, >50% polymorphs \u00b1 organisms on Gram stain, supported by history and examination. Results: 23 patients included in study. All on cycler dialysis. Age 8.8 \u00b1 5.7 years. Mean Time on PD 18 \u00b1 13 months, range 1 -54 months. All received intravenous antibiotics at time of Double cuff Tenckhoff catheter insertion. Over 5 year period mean number of Peritonitis Episodes was 1 per 73 Patient Months of PD, range 1 per 14.3 to 1 per 95.5 months.10 episodes of peritonitis over 5 years. Mean number of peritonitis episodes per patient was 1.3 (range 1-3). Median time to onset of peritonitis post insertion of catheter was 1 month (range 2 days to 29 months).Median number of WCC was 1,050 (range 160-100,000). In 5 no organism was cultured. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 4 ( 1 was relapse) and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 2 episode, 1 by Pantoea spp.2 Tenckhoff catheters removed because of Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis. Mean duration of treatment with intraperitoneal antibiotics 12 days (range 3-21). Vancomycin and ciprofl oxacin are antibiotics used. Conclusions: Low rate of peritonitis due to intense training of parents by dedicated trained nursing staff. No case of gram negative peritonitis and only 2 catheters lost over 5 years. Objectives: Diabetic (DM) nephropathy leads to end-stage renal failure. Its pathophisiology is unclear, but the role of the RAAS is presumptive. Previously we found elevated expression and translocation of the renal Na/K ATPase (NKA) in a DM rat model, which worsens renal function. Heat-shock protein (HSP) 72 provides a stable, membrane associated NKA. Methods: We induced DM in male Wistar rats with iv. streptozotocin (60 mg/ kg). After 5 weeks of DM we daily treated them with ACE inhibitor enalapril (40 mg/kg/day), renin inhibitor aliskiren (30 mg/kg/day) and aldosteron antagonist spironolactone (50 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks p.o. Untreated DM, and treated non-DM animals served as controls (n=6/group). To evaluate protein levels and intrarenal localization of NKA and HSP72 we used Western blot, and immunofl uorescent staining. Results: DM rats had higher NKA and HSP72 protein expressions than the controls. Aliskiren, and spironolactone reduced the elevated NKA and HSP72 protein levels in DM rats (p<0.05 vs. DM). NKA moved from the basolateral membrane to the cytoplasm in tubular cells in DM group vs controls, which was prevented only by aliskiren treatment. Conclusions: Higher glucose levels might be the reason for altered protein expression and distribution in DM nephropathy. Various RAAS inhibitors infl uence the expression and distribution of NKA, which could explain their various clinical effi cacies in moderating DM nephropathy.",

The pediatric adaptation (pRIFLE) defi nes risk (R) as a decrease in estimated Schwartz-GFR by 25%, incipient (I) by 50% and failure (F) by 75%. This corresponds to a rise in creatinine (Crea) by 1.33, 2 and 4 x baseline concentration. Aim: To develop a corresponding defi nition for cystatin C (Cys), an alternative marker of GFR, using a pharmacokinetic model. Methods: Simulation of Cys and Crea concentrations during AKI using a onecompartment model with zero-order input. Baseline GFR entered as 100 ml/ min/1.73m 2 , volume of distribution as total body water (Crea) or extracellular fl uid (Cys), production rate as 20 mg/kg/day and 0.117 mg/min/1.73m 2 , respectively. Clearance taken linear with GFR. In a second analysis, extrarenal elimination of Cys (i.e. 22.7 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) taken into account. The corresponding relative rise in Cys concentrations calculated using Cys-based GFR-estimation equations by Grubb and by Filler for comparison. Results: Following an acute decrease in GFR, Cys concentrations reach a new steady state after 4 (R), 6 (I) and 13 (F) vs. 13, 19 and 39 hours (Crea). Taking only renal elimination into account, the relative rise (RR) of Cys is 1.33 (R), 2 (I) and 4 (F) x baseline concentration. If extra-renal elimination is included, RR is only 1.28, 1.79 and 2.97. The latter corresponds better with in vivo data (Grubb 1.19, 1.51, 2.28; Filler 1.29, 1.85, 3.44) .",

The strategy against TLS had been hyperhydration, urine alkalinization, and allopurinol to protect the kidney. Recently, rasburicase was added to the armament against this life-threatening condition. In Korea, rasburicase is used as a rescue therapy for cases with allopurinol-resistant hyperuricemia due to the restriction by the National Health Insurance. We reviewed our experiences throughout the last decades to re-assess the risk factors of childhood TLS and the effi cacy of rasburicase in our country. Methods: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 396 children who were diagnosed as acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) at our center between 2000 and 2009. The risk factors for TLS were analyzed statistically, and those before and after the availability of rasburicase were compared. Results: Sixty eight patients (17.2%) had TLS with no mortality. Multivariate analysis showed that pre-chemotherapy hypophosphatemia was a signifi cant independent risk factor for TLS, in addition to the known risk factors of hyperuricemia and high LD concentration. The availability of rasburicase as a rescue therapy did not negate the importance of uric acid as a risk factor of TLS. Conclusions: Rasburicase as a second line treatment for intractable hyperuricemia was not effective in reducing the incidence of TLS. Since prechemotherapy hypophosphatemia was a signifi cant independent risk factor for TLS in addition to the traditional risk factors, hypophosphatemia may be a warning sign for emergency dialysis.",

Results: Whole blood from a child with EHEC-associated HUS showed surface-bound C3 on 27% of platelet-monocyte complexes compared to 3% of platelet-monocyte complexes from a healthy volunteer. Plasma samples from 10 patients with EHEC-induced HUS were analyzed for the presence of microparticles derived from platelets, monocytes and neutrophils. Acute phase samples exhibited high levels of platelet microparticles and, to a lesser extent, monocyte microparticles, both bearing C3 and C9. Levels decreased signifi cantly at recovery. Stx or O157LPS incubated with whole blood from healthy donors increased the population of platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil complexes with surface-bound C3 and C9. Simultaneous incubation with Stx and O157LPS enhanced C3 and C9 deposition on complexes. Both Stx and O157LPS induced the release of microparticles, mostly from platelets and monocytes, which had C3 and C9 deposited on their surfaces. Conclusions: Complement deposition on leukocytes and platelets would promote their activation, and the presence of complement on platelet-leukocyte complexes, and microparticles-derived from these cells, suggests a role in the infl ammatory and thrombogenic events occurring during HUS.",

Objectives: Typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a self-limited disorder, but atypical disease, not associated with diarrhea, has signifi cant acute morbidity and high rates of recurrence and progression to end-stage renal disease. Multiple complement pathway mutations are thought to predispose to atypical HUS. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and the effi cacy of anti complement factor H (CFH) antibody related atypical HUS. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed CFH and anti CFH antibody in 13 children with atypical HUS from 2005 to 2008. Age ranged from 2-11(mean age of 5.3), 5 boys and 8 girls. They were divided two groups; anti CFH antibody positive group and anti CFH antibody negative group. We compared two groups. These character were positive group (2 boys and 1 girl) and negative group (3 boys and 7girls). Results: Three children have high titer of anti CFH antibody (positive group), case 1 has 2094.6ug/ml, case 2 has 1403.4ug/ml, case 3 has 427.6ug/ml. Negative group(other ten children) have low titer of anti CFH antibody mean 96.4ug/ml. Positive group was performed plasma pheresis or hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Now they were administered immunosuprresive therapy and low anti CFH antibody and normal complement, renal function was almost normal. Familial hypocomplementaemia was not found in two groups.",

Methods: Between 2002 Between -2008 patients (< 19 yrs old) with CRF (gfr <75 ml/ min/1,73 m\u00b2) were entered in the database. Results: Comparison of Nicaraguan vs Italian (ItalKid) data shows a lower incidence and prevalence of CRF in Nicaragua: 9.3 vs 12.1 new cases/yr/million age-related population (marp) and 42.9 vs 74.7 marp. These data are repectively due to the under-diagnosis of kidney diseases in particular of VUR (0,8 vs 25,8 % of causes of CRF) and to the higher mortality rate (39,1 vs 1,4%). The high grade of CRF at fi rst diagnosis (IV-V NKF-CKD in 56% of pts) and the high rate of unknown causes of CRF (30.8 vs 3,3%) indicate late referral. A higher percentage of neurogenic bladder (15 vs 3.7%), lupus nephritis (4,2 vs 1,1%) and glomerulopathies (19,2vs 5.8%) suggests different etiology of CRF due to geographic/genetic reasons and the need of improving primary and secondary care over the territory. Conclusions: The database played an important role to gather epidemiological information and allocate project resources over the territory for a bettere diagnosis and prevention of CRF.",

Results: 80 patients developed AKI by pRIFLE criteria,28(35%)patients reached pRIFLEmax for risk,29(36.2%) for injury and 23(28.7%) for failure. AKI occurred early in the course of PICU stay (First day 62 cases, second day 12 and third day 6 cases).Common admitting diagnoses were encephalitis(23%) septicemia(20%)and congestive heart failure(19%).Mean PRISM III score was 11.01\u00b18.30with a maximum of 18.35\u00b16.93 in failure group.61.2% patients with AKI required mechanical ventilation.Mean duration of ventilation was 4.02\u00b11.88 days.91.2%AKI patients were on vasopressors.Mean number of medications was 2.55\u00b177. Serum creatinine showed stronger association than urine output alone.5(6.2%) AKI patients required renal replacement therapy and all belonged to failure group.Mean PICU length of stay and hospital stay in AKI group were5.92\u00b12.64 days and 7.72\u00b14.66 days respectively.A signifi cant mortality of 61.25% was observed in AKI patients.AKI was independent risk factor irrespective of admitting diagnosis.

Objectives: Renal replacement therapy for infants began in 1980s.Before this, nephrologists believed treatment was unjustifi ed because of ethical dilemmas and uncertain outcome.Data on long-term outcome of these young children is emerging, but there little is known about psychosocial aspects.We have previously reported the outcome of 101 infants who presented with CKD stage 4/5 after1986 (Mekahli et al. CJASN2010; 5:10-7) .We now describe the psychosocial outcome of those who are now young adults. Methods: Forty patients now aged >16 years were sent a 71-item questionnaire:36 from the Rand-36 Health survey and 35 about environment and social life.Patient scores were compared according to gender,duration of dialysis and/or transplant, number and treatment modality changes and compared with general UK population. Results are given as median(range). Results: All 40 patients(12 females) completed the questionnaire at age 19. 2(16.3-23.4) years.Five were on dialysis and 35 were transplanted.Ages at diagnosis of CKD and start of RRT were 0.1(0.0-1.4) and 4.5(0.0-15.6) years and cumulative times on dialysis or transplant were 1.4(0.0-7.7) and 12.8(1.0-21.3) years respectively.Numbers of changes of modality were 2(1-7).Compared with the general UK population our cohort fared worse in physical and social functioning and general health.Patients who had more than one transplantation and/or period of dialysis had a worse health score(p<0.05). 28(70%) were still living at home and 16(40%) of the patients' parents were separated or divorced. Conclusions: Long term outcome of infant with CKD is continuously improving, however,we need to pay more attention to their social and emotional well-being and encourage parents to stimulate social contacts and autonomy.

Thomas Objectives: Renal dysfunction is a major complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). We hypothesized that subjects with SCD will have increased urinary excretion of Transforming Growth Factor \u03b2-1 (TGF\u03b21) and Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) as compared to healthy controls (CTR). Methods: 51 Patients (42 with hemoglobin SS, 8 with hemoglobin SC/SD) and 21 controls (CTR) had spot urine samples collected. ELISA was used to detect urinary TGF\u03b21/NGAL. Exclusion criteria: subjects who received blood transfusion in the last 90 days, estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) of <60ml/min/1.73m\u00b2, or presence of any other glomerular disease. Results: Mean age, gender, and race were not statistically different between SCD and CTR. Urinary excretion of TGF\u03b21was 26.4 pg/mg Cr +/-1.5 in SCD vs 14.9 pg/mg Cr +/-2.4 in CTR, (p<0.00001). TGF\u03b21was higher in both SS and SC subjects (SS vs CTR, p=0.001, and SC vs CTR, p=0.01), but there was no statistical difference between SS and SC TGF\u03b21 levels. SCD patients with hemoglobin less than 9gm/dl had higher urinary TGF\u03b21 than SCD patients with milder anemia, (p=0.002). There was no difference in urinary NGAL between the SCD subjects vs CTR. There were no correlation between urinary TGF\u03b21 and levels of urinary microalbumin (p=0.15) or estimated glomerular function. Conclusions: Urinary TGF\u03b21, a biomarker of renal injury, may serve as a better guide than microalbuminuria to monitor progression of renal disease. This proposition needs to be tested prospectively.",

Motoyoshi Objectives: A ten year old boy with high risk AML received cord-blood transplantation using CY 120mg/kg + kidney uncovered TBI 12Gy as conditioning regimen on July 2008. Leukemic relapse was developed on March 2009 and he received second transplantation with allogenic unrelated HLA DRB1 mismatched bone marrow. After 2nd BMT, serum creatinine and cystatin C had elevated to 0.40 mg/dl and 2.11 mg/l, respectively, and although there was no hematuria observed, his urinary protein increased to 1g/day. Results: By the symptoms of GVHD appeared in September 2009, the dose of FK506 was increased although his serum Cre level was 2.97 mg/dl. FK506 improved GVHD paralleled with serum Cre level to 2.0 mg/dl. Interestingly, tapering of FK506 was accompanied with relapse of renal dysfunction. Kidney biopsy on November 2009 showed diffuse interstitial fi brosis and edema, tubular atrophy, remarkable glomerular mesangiolysis and features of TMA those of which seemed responsible for renal dysfunction. Immunofl uorescence study was negative for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C4 and C1q. Presence of TMA was confi rmed by electron microscopy. Conclusions: Clinical profi les and kidney pathology suggested that both interstitial fi brosis and TMA by radiation nephropathy as well as GVHD might be the base of kidney dysfunction of the patient. Re-elevation of serum Cre after reduction of FK506 administration is likely explained by remedy of renal circulation including attenuation of interstitial edema and improvement of TMA changes via modulation of systemic GVHD. Results: The incidence of paediatric chronic kidney disease native to Hanoi City was estimated to be 5.1 per million-child population (pmcp). Median age was 11.29 years; 60.5% were boys and 39.5% were girls; 65% of patients were in endstage renal disease. Cause of chronic kidney disease included glomerulonephritis (66.4%) and congenital/hereditary anomalies (13%). In 19.8% of children, the aetiology was unavailable. During hospitalization, 5 patients died and 76 patients (50%) refused the treatment although benefi ciary of health insurance. Thirty patients (19.74%) received peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, 7 patients received renal transplantation with a familial living donor. Conclusions: Late referral and limited facilities for renal replacement therapy explain the poor outcome in this study. We need a program to delineate the burden of chronic kidney disease and improve primary health care for health promotion and prevention of paediatric chronic kidney disease.",

Methods: Clinicolaboratory data of hAKI patients were retrospectively analysed. The AKI Network Workgroup's serum creatinine (Scr) crteria were used. hAKI was staged both at onset and peak (highest recorded Scr) of AKI. Results: Annual hAKI incidence and prevalence rates were 0.17% (or 3.7 per million children population [pmcp] /year) and 0.84% (or 18.3 pmcp), respectively. Male (20): female (8) ratio was 2.5: 1. Median age was 5 (0.063-15.0) years. At hAKI onset there were 14 (50.0%), 5 (18.0%) and 9 (32.0%) patients in AKI stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At peak of injury there were 4 (14.3%), 7 (25.0%), and 17 (60.7%), respectively in AKI-1, -2 and -3. None progressed to permanent kidney function loss. AKI-3 was most anuric with high dialysis requirement (p=0.0329). Nephrotoxics (42.87%): frusemide, cytotoxics, captopril and lisinopril caused hAKI most. All deaths were in AKI-2 and -3. 75% of deaths were in the fi rst 28 hAKI days. Median survival time was 23.5 admission (11-52) days. Maximum Scr means for survivors (486.0 \u00b1 382.0 \u00b5mol/L or 5.5 \u00b1 4.3 mg/ dL) and non-survivors (353.0 \u00b1 160.0 \u00b5mol/L or 4.0 \u00b1 1.8 mg/dL) were similar (p>0.20). The 60-day cumulative mortality was 36.7%. Conclusions: Progression from one AKI stage to the next severe stage occurred commonly. Scr level was not a reliable mortality determinant. Maximal mortality in the fi rst 28 hAKI days and high mortality rate called for high level of clinical vigilance and informed therapeutic interventions to limit AKI progression during this period.",

Methods: Prospective followup of all consecutive admissions to a level II NICU with serial serum creatinine and urine output monitoring till discharge and at 3 months of age. Neonates were classifi ed for AKI as per AKIN criteria as well as using a serum Creatinine cutoff of >1.5 mg/dl as per previously published studies. Results: 125 neonates were recruited (28-42 wks;median 36 wks) over 18 months. Comorbidities: MAS (9.6%), sepsis (35.2%), asphyxia (23.2%), RDS (8.8%), shock (2.4%), neonatal jaundice (40%) and antibiotics in 79 (63.2%) babies -aminoglycosides 34.4%; vancomycin 12%. 67(53.6%) neonates showed a difference of >=0.3 mg/dl between peak and baseline creatinine values with a median time gap of 120 hours. Peak creatinine values ranged from 0.3to 4.2 mg/dl; baseline values ranged from 0.2 to 2.3 mg/dl. Oliguria of >= 6 hours was observed in 16 (12.8%) cases; 11 in fi rst 24 hours of life; 10 had serum creatinine rise of at least 0.3 mg/dl (range 0.3-1.4 mg/dl).

Using AKIN criteria, 10/125 (8%) cases met the serum creatinine criteria and 05 (4%) cases met urinary output criteria leading to AKI prevalence of 12% (stage I -10; II-3; III-2). Mortality was 2.4%; progression to CKD was observed in 04 cases (3.2%) ; all had oliguria and serum creatinine > 0.9 mg/dl at end of 02 weeks.

Objectives: To determine causes of acute renal failure in children and to compare outcomes between periods: 1998-2003 and 2004-2008. Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records data of all children treated for acute renal failure (ARF) in Kaunas Medical University Hospital between 1998-2008 years was made. Causes of ARF, sex and age at the onset of the disease, the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), duration and methods of RRT were evaluated. Comparison between periods (1998-2003 and 2004-2008) was made. Results: 179 children were included in the study. The age range of patients was 1 month to 18 years. 75 were treated in year 1998-2003 (I group) and 104 in 2004 -2008 . 124 (69.3%) children were treated in PICU. Basic characteristics (according to child sex and age) between the groups didn't differ. Causes of ARF between the groups did't differ (p>0.05): primary kidney disease 22 (29.3%) in the I group vs 27 (26.0%) in the II group, sepsis 11 (14.7%) vs 28 (26.9%), HUS 7 (9.3%) vs 8 (7.7%) and other causes. Multi organ failure (MOF) was diagnosed in 33 (44.0%) vs 40 (38.5%) patients (p<0.05). 55 (30.7%) childred needed RRT: 29 .3% in the I group and 30.8% in the II group. RRT procedures performed: HD 37 (67.3%), PD 13 (23.6%) and CRRT 5 (9.1%). 28 (37.3%) children with ARF died in the period of 1998-2003 and 15 (14.4%) -in 2004-2008 (p<0.05) . The most common cause of the death was sepsis with MOF: 78.8% in the I group and 37.5% in the II group (p<0.001). Objectives: Cardiovascular events are important causes of morbidity in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed at determining factors present during CKD stages 2-5 that may affect cardiovascular status at the time of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Pearson's correlation and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed. Results: 54.3% of patients had at least one echocardiographic abnormality at onset of ESRD. Severe LVMI (>51g/m 2 ) was present in 21.7%. There was signifi cant correlation between SBPi and LVMI (r=0.33, p=0.027), DBPi and both FS (r=-0.40, p=0.006) and EF (r=-0.42, p=0.004), and uric acid and LVMI (r=0.46, p=0.001). Only time-averaged uric acid (p=0.002) was a signifi cant predictor of LVMI on multivariate linear regression. Conclusions: Time-averaged serum uric acid independent of elevated blood pressures, appeared to be an important predictor of LVMI at onset of ESRD.

Objectives: The objective was to apply the classifi cations criteria proposed by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) and the criteria pRIFLE in ctitically ill children and to determine the clinical characteristics, laboratory features and outcomes of AKI. Methods: We retrospectively studied children with sepsis and AKI admitted to Pediatric Care Intensive Unit (PICU) (Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu,UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista) in a tertiary hospital. Results: Seventy seven patients (47 male; 30 female) were enrolled. Median age at the time of AKI was 4 months (range 1 to 132 months). Twenty six patients (33,8%) received invasive mechanical ventilation and 76 received vasoactive medications. Mean PICU lenght of stay was 7,33\u00b10,16days and 66 patients (85,7%) had the diagnosis od AKI at the fi rst day of hospitalization in the PICU.Twenty patients (25,9%) presented oligo-anuria and peritoneal dialysis was perfomed in 33 (42,8%). Patients ' AKI classifi cation according to the AKIN criteria was: 11(14,3%) stage 1; 23(29,9%) stage 2 and 43 (55,8%) stage3.

Hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, thrombocitopenia, PICU length of stay, invasive mechanical ventilation, dialysis need and stage 2 and stage 3 patients' AKI were independent risk factors of mortality. Admission creatinine and urea were 7.1 +/-3.41 and 121.8 +/-47 mg/dl, respectively. Proteinuria and hematuria were universally found. Urine cultures were positive in 6, negative in 10 and not done in 7. Admission Hb was 5.8 +/-1.6 gm/dl; platelets 188000 +/-126 /mm3. Fragmented RBCS were seen in all but 2 cases. Treatment included antihypertensives in 14, steroids in 3, blood transfusion in 18, plasma transfusion in 15, plasmapheresis in 3, acute PD in 15 and HD in 8. Four recovered, 5 died and 14 ended up with CKD. Conclusions: HUS is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries.

Animals were sacrifi ced when the uremic rats exhibited catch-up growth after food restriction (Kidney Int 2006; 70,1955-61) . Results: Consistent quantitative differences were not found in any of the analyzed peptides, although protein expressions of BMP2 and VEGF showed a tendency towards repression by GH treatment. The immunohistochemical distribution pattern of IGF-I, IGFBP5, TGF\u03b2, PTHrP and caspase 3 was patched in the widened hypertrophic zones of uremic rats with GH instead of being uniform as in the other groups.",

Goyal Objectives: There is paucity of data on incidence, epidemiology and risk factors for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children post cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery. The objective was to investigate the incidence, implicating factors and outcome of AKI (AKIN criteria) after cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: Design: Retrospective review study. Patients: One hundred and twenty fi ve children (less than 18 years of age) admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit following cardiopulmonary bypass between January 2007 and December 2009. Methods: Age, sex, diagnosis, Jenkins score, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, ischemia time, Baseline and post surgery: biochemical investigations, urea (mg/dl), creatinine (mg/dl), urine output (ml/kg/hr), frusemide dose, inotrope requirement, and systemic dysfunctions (cardiac, renal, hepatic and neurological) were recorded. Results: Results: Seven (5%) children developed AKI I, 5 (4%) developed AKI II and 2 developed AKI stage III (2%). The patients with AKI stage II and III had a longer ICU stay and increased mortality. Two children required dialysis and none developed chronic renal impairment. All patients with AKI III died during the ICU stay. Using stepwise regression, younger age (< 1 year), low cardiac output, sepsis and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass were the signifi cant risk factors identifi ed for developing AKI. Conclusions: Conclusions: AKI is common and occurred in 11% of children following cardiac surgery, but AKI requiring renal replacement therapy is uncommon.",

Two recent controlled studies that followed children with D+ HUS after an E coli O157:H7 outbreak, with controls selected from the population exposed in the outbreak, have confl icting results. To clarify this apparent difference in renal outcome, we evaluated renal sequelae after sporadic D+HUS with unexposed case matched controls. Methods: Thirty children after sporadic D+ HUS were compared in long-term follow-up with 30 children unexposed to E coli O157:H7 that were age and gender matched. Both groups had measurements of albuminuria, blood pressure (BP) and estimated GFR (Cystatin C). For children, BP measurements were converted to z scores and percentiles. Results: In the follow-up (median 6.2 years, range 3.3-20.1), 40% of the HUS patients showed albuminuria, and one-third of albuminuric subjects had macroalbuminuria. In contrast, microalbuminuria was present in only 3% of the matched controls, and none had macroalbuminuria. The proportion of children with hypertension and prehypertension was three times higher and eGFR was 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 lower in the HUS group versus the controls. Conclusions: Unlike the interpretation in two controlled studies on D+HUS with controls exposed in the outbreaks, children with sporadic D+ HUS compared to unexposed controls had a higher prevalence of chronic renal sequelae.Future studies with unexposed controls can expand on this issue.",

Methods: A 3-year-old boy with chronic renal failure secondary to bilateral hypoplastic kidneys became ill tempered. He had been on peritoneal dialysis (PD) since 10-month-old of age. Two days later, his parents noticed his visual impairment and he was hospitalized the next day. It was found he had received a vaccination of H1N1 fl u ten days before the admission. Results: On examination, his general condition was good; however, his pupil was dilated and didn't respond to light stimulation in both eye. On fundus examination bilateral papilledema was observed. He had no other abnormal neurological fi ndings including ocular movement. A brain magnetic resonance imaging and an electroencephalogram were normal. We made a diagnosis of optic neuritis and employed methylprednisolone pulse (MP) therapy three times and supplementation of oral vitamins with continuing PD. However, he was left with severe visual impairment one month later. He had transient hyponatremia during the MP therapy.

Baracho Objectives: This study aimed to characterize functional changes produced by progressive nephrectomy in rats. Methods: Male Wistar rats were anesthetized and submitted to progressive degrees of nephrectomy. According to surgical procedure, animals were allocated into experimental groups and placed in individual metabolic cages for two weeks: control(sham operated animals, n=10), unilateral nephrectomy(n=10), 3/4 nephrectomy(n=10) and 5/6 nephrectomy(n=10). Daily measurements of urinary output, water and food intake were performed. At the end of experiment, blood and 24-hour urine samples were collected to determine serum and urinary concentrations of creatinine, urea, Na, K and microalbuminuria. Results: Unilateral nephrectomy did not change water intake and urinary output, but increased serum creatinine and urea and reduced creatinine clearance(p<0.05). 3/4 nephrectomy also did not change water and food intake. However, this procedure increased urinary output, microalbuminuria and serum levels of urea, creatinine, Na and K(p< 0.05). 5/6 nephrectomy did not change food intake, but increased water intake and urinary output and produced the highest serum levels of urea, creatinine, Na, K and microalbuminuria and the lowest creatinine clearance(p< 0.05).

Conclusions: Histological analysis suggested that the acute renal failure may have been secondary to acute renal ischemic event, but features of chronic renal injury, FSGS and interstitial fi brosis may have been caused by continuous mitochondrial dysfunction. Most of ATN cases with normal renal function prior to ischemic event recover suffi cient renal function, but our case rapidly developed to ESRF.

This fact raises a question about expendiency of lumbar pubcture and possibility of revising a fever workup guidlines in this group of patients. The most common causative organism was E.Coli in both groups. 5) On the sonographic fi ndings, the most lesions were seen on the upper lobe of the kidney, more frequent on the left side. The lesions of 29 cases showed globular or wedge shaped increased echogenecity compared with the adjacent normal renal cortex. 6) 99mTc-DMSA scan could detect earlier lesion of AFBN which was not seen on ultrasonography at initial diagnosis. It showed the complete coincidence of the location, size and shape in all cases compared to the fi ndings of renal sonography. 6) 14 of 18 cases who had radiologic follow up showed improvement by antibiotics therapy alone. Conclusions: Ultrasonography is excellent as an initial detection tool in diagnosing AFBN. Since the degree of infection in AFBN is more severe than other UTIs and evolution into a renal abscess is possible, early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotics therapy is essential.",

We noticed, that the maximum indicators of activity of lysosomal enzymes of urine among children are elderly till 6 years, and also among children above 6 years are registered in patients with chronic OPN with 2-nd and 3-rd degree of activity of infl ammatory process in kidneys in comparison with patients with acute and chronic NPN. Conclusions: So, we registered the dependence of changes in levels of activity of lysosomal enzymuria on the degree of activity of infl ammatory process in kidneys and on the age of PNH children. Objectives: Probiotics, benefi cial living microorganisms, were deemed to be an alternative to antibiotics for prophylaxis but the preventive effect against UTI is inconclusive. To compare the effect of probiotic prophylaxis with antibiotic prophylaxis, a prospective randomized controlled study was done in infants with primary VUR. Methods: Methods: 132 infants (age 5.2+4.5 months), who were diagnosed to have primary VUR after their fi rst UTI, were randomly allocated into a probiotic (Antibio300 R Lactobacillus acidophilus 10 8 CFU/g 1g twice daily, n=64) or an antibiotic (Septrin R trimethoprim/sulfi methoxazole (TMP-SMX) 2/10 mg/kg once at night, n=64) prophylaxis groups and were followed for one year. Four infants were dropped out and 128 infants were analyzed. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, including 739 school children aged 6 to 12 years from 3 public schools, being 239 from school 1 (socioeconomic class C), located in Belo Horizonte, and two social class D schools; school 2 with 267 students and school 3 located in the metropolitan area of high social risk, with 233 children. We carried out an interview in the school environment, with questions about the voiding during the night. NE was considered when the child had at least 1 episode of bedwetting per month. Children with NE received an educational booklet on the function of the lower urinary tract and also a referral for medical evaluation. Results: NE was detected in 110 (14.8%) children and classifi ed as monosymptomatic enuresis (MNE) in 63 (57.2%), being more prevalent in boys; nonmonosymptomatic enuresis (NMEN) were detected in 47 (42.7%) children, with higher prevalence in girls (34).

Methods: We analyzed the fi les of 62 girls (5 to 12 years) with at least one episode of UTI and high suspicion of overactive bladder (OBA Patients were already on antibiotic prophylaxis before 46% of the UTI episodes. Ultrasound, DMSA scan and VSUG were found abnormal in 39%, 42% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Overall, 64% of the patients had an underlying predisposing factor for UTI (voiding dysfunction in 38%, anomaly in 32%). When we divided the patients according to the age of the fi rst UTI episode due to ESBL producing bacteria; 34 (19 boys) were <12 (Group 1), 23 (7 boys) were in between 12-60 (Group 2) and 37 (2 boys) were >60 months of age (Group 3). Acute pyelonephritis occured in 68%, 52% and 27% of groups 1,2 and 3 respectively. 78% of the patients in group 3 had voiding dysfunction.

Recent studies show the important role of extracellular Zn-containing proteases in renal damage. In order to reveal the possible role of MMP-2,-9 and TIMP-1 in renal scarring formation 25 children (aged 1-12 years) with PN were examined. 8 of them with acute presentation of PN were examined twice (at onset and after 10-14 days of antibacterial treatment). Seven of 25 patients had a remission of PN. Methods: ELISA-measured MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 in urine standardized to urinary creatinine (uCr) concentrations were evaluated. Results: All children with acute PN demonstrated signifi cant increase of MMP-2, -9 and TIMP-1 in the urine. After treatment MMP-2 level decreased in 2 times, MMP-9 level-in 10 times. Only TIMP-1 was still elevated (p<0,05). Out of 7 children with remission of PN, four had higher urinary level of MMP-2, -9 and TIMP-1 than others (p<0,001), close to patients with acute infl ammation. Theremore TIMP-1 urinary level was higher than MMP-9. These children presented with severe onset and had VUR. Conclusions: High level of TIMP-1 in children with acute PN after treatment may be a result of progressing macrophages infi ltration of renal tissue, leading to fi brosis. Signifi cant disturbances in extracellular proteases system in patients with abnormal urodynamics may be considered as a risk factor of developing refl ux nephropathy.",

Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of circumcision on the frequencies UTIs and renal parenchymal damage as well as growth and nutrition of infants with antenatal hydronephrosis. Methods: Infants with a fetal pelvis diameter of \u22655mm identifi ed with antenatal US were followed-up. All patients were evaluated in terms of UTI frequency, pelvic diameter, scarring on DMSA and differential function on DTPA. Growth(heightSDS) and nutrition(relative weight) parameters were recorded as well. These parameters were assessed after circumcision. Statistical evaluation was made by using khi-square test. Results: The study included 178 patients. Of these, 29 were diagnosed by VUR, 87 by obstructive uropathy and 54 by non-obstructive uropathy. Of 133 males, 111 infants were circumcised. The pre-circumcision UTI frequency[(2.97\u00b11.14/ year(y)] was signifi cantly higher than post-circumcision period(0.25\u00b10.67/y).

In obstructive uropathy patients, the rate of renal damage was increased in uncircumcised patients(28.5%vs35.7%) whereas no change was observed in circumcised patients(11.2%vs12.5%). Overall, growth and nutrition parameters gradually improved after circumcision. Conclusions: The close follow-up and early circumcision of infants with AH will prevent UTIs and renal parenchymal damage, enabling normal growth and nutrition.",

The resistance rates were 83.1% for TMP-SMX, 18.2% for nitrofurantoin, 47.3% for quinolones, 39.9% for aminoglycosides in ESBL (+) group, whereas 62.2% for TMP-SMX, 4.6% for nitrofurantoin, 9.7% for quinolones, 9.7% for aminoglycosides in ESBL (-) group. Being younger than one year old, high annual reccurence rate of UTI, longer duration of antibiotic prophylaxis, using cephalosporins for prophylaxis, previous hospitalization in last 3 months, having vesicoureteral refl ux, using clean intermittent catheterization were found to be more frequent in ESBL (+) UTI group (p<0.05). According to logistic regression analysis age younger than one year old and high annual reccurence rate of UTI were identifi ed as independent risk factors; the risk increased by 1,74 fold and 2,25 fold respectively. Conclusions: Recognition of the risk factors for ESBL (+) bacteria may be helpful to determine new policies in management of UTI. Objectives: Clinically signifi cant markers of urinary tract infection (UTI) and vescioureteral refl ux (VUR) can improve their diagnosis and help determine the risk for renal damage. We hypothesized that hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules on the ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy can predict the renal risks in patients with UTI. Methods: The clinical and radiological fi ndings of 387 children with a proven evidence of UTI were retrospectively reviewed. The study sample included 19 pediatric patients with UTI combined with hepatic and/or pulmonary nodular lesions diagnosed by the imaging tests performed for the UTI. Results: Hepatic nodules were detected in fi ve patients, pulmonary nodules in 12, and both hepatic and pulmonary nodules in two patients. The mean age of the children was 24.5 months. VUR was detected in nine out of 17 patients (52.9%), and high grade VUR in 55.6% children with VUR. Acute pyelonephritis was identifi ed in nine out of 18 patients and renal scarring in 57.1% patients with pyelonephritis. On follow-up, the hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules regressed in Tuesday, August 31 all but one case, where the nodule was reduced in size. About 85.7% of patients experienced a recurrence of UTI within 1 year. Conclusions: Our data shows that children with UTI and hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules had a high risk for renal damage, VUR, and recurrent infections. The hepatic and/or pulmonary nodules on the ultrasound and dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy may offer a valuable sign for the proper management of the patients with UTI.",

Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Objectives: Monitoring of renal function is crucial in children treated for malignancy. Muscle wasting is common among these patients and hampers the use of serum creatinine. Cystatin C has emerged as an alternative because its metabolism is independent of muscle mass, but data on its use in pediatric oncology are sparse. Hypothesis: estimation of glomerular fi ltration rate using cystatin C is more accurate than creatinine in children treated for malignancy. Methods: Inulin clearance (Cin), estimated GFR using serum cystatin according to Filler (eGFRcys) and creatinine according to Schwartz (eGFRcrea) were measured in 68 patients with active malignancy and compared with 150 controls. Creatinine was measured using a kinetic Jaff\u00e9 method, cystatin C by particleenhanced immunonephelometry. We analyzed the difference between measured and estimated GFRs and the performance of both eGFRs for the detection of mild renal insuffi ciency. Results: Multiple linear regression analysis showed an overestimation of GFR by eGFRcrea both in females (b=-8.65, p=0.001) and in patients with malignancy (b=-6.05, p=0.069). eGFRcys overestimated GFR in females (b=-7.33, p=0.016) but was independent of malignancy (b=3.90, p=0.335). Agreement between the eGFRs and Cin was comparable in the control group (k-value eGFRcrea 0.367 vs. eGFRcys 0.396), while eGFRcrea performed poorly (k -0.114) in the malignancy group. ROC analysis (cut-off of 90 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) showed that the diagnostic accuracy of eGFRcys was higher than eGFRcrea (AUC 0.823 vs. 0.599) in the malignancy group. Both performed comparably in the control group. Conclusions: Cystatin C is superior to creatinine as a marker of renal function in children with active malignancy. DISCLOSURE: B\u00f6kenkamp, A.: Other, The immunonephelometric assays were a kind gift from Siemens Healthcare, Marburg, Germany. Objectives: Progressive interstitial fi brosis is the most dramatic result of obstructive nephropathy (ON). The aim of this study is to show and compare the actions of simvastatin (Simv) and erythropoietin (Epo) in nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF \u03b2), basic fi broblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF B), fi bronectin expression and development of interstitital fi brosis in rats with experimentally induced unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Methods: Sprague Dawley rats, arranged in four groups as sham, Epo, Simv and control, were used. All rats except group sham underwent UUO. Epo, Simv and control groups were given Epo (1000IU/kg/every other day, intraperitoneal), Simv (2mg/kg/day) and vehicle by gavage respectively, for 14 days. For TGF-\u03b2, PDGF B, bFGF, NFkB and fi bronectin expressions, immunohistochemical methods were used. Results: TGF-\u03b2 and fi bronectin expressions were higher in control group compared to Epo and Simv groups. In addition, fi bronectin expression in Simv group was higher than Epo group. Different than the Simv group, NfkB and bFGF expressions in control group were higher than Epo group. Conclusions: As a result it was seen that Epo and Simv prevented fi brosis in ON. Epo was superior to Simv in this effect by suppressing the expressions of profi brotic factors NFkB, bFGF and fi bronectin. Based on this fi ndings, it was thought that Epo might be a better agent than Simv in the prevention of fi brosis in ON. Objectives: The currently used chronic kidney disease (CKD) classifi cation system characterizes the severity of kidney disease by 5 stages, based on the calculation of an estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR). Recently, the Schwartz formula was found to routinely overestimate the eGFR, the difference based on a change in the methodology of serum creatinine determination from Jaffe to enzymatic. A new estimating equation has been generated by the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study, which more accurately estimates GFR. We recently developed a program at our institution which automatically calculates the eGFR by the CKiD formula based on the patient's serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and height recorded after hospital admission. Methods: Collection of eGFR and demographic data from hospitalized children between 1-22 years over a 1 month period of observation. Results: eGFR values were recorded from 262 patients. Mean age: 8.63 years, mean serum creatinine: 0.33 mg/dl and mean eGFR: 102.27ml/min/1.73m2. Prevalence of low eGFR by CKD stage was: stage 4: 0.4%, stage 3:6.4% and stage 2:25.4%. The mean age of patients with low eGFR was 8.6 year. Greater than 50% of patients with low eGFR were male. The subspecialties with the highest prevalence of eGFR<90 were general pediatrics 41.3%, endocrinology 35%, cardiology 50%, critical care 56.2%, nephrology 80%, neurology 60%, surgery 33%, and ENT 50%. Conclusions: Based on this pilot study, the prevalence of impaired kidney function as determined by an accurate assessment of eGFR appears to effect more than one-quarter of hospitalized patients, potentially carrying the risk of previously undetected impaired kidney function in children.",

Department of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Children's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Objectives: Melamine is the key factor of the outbreaks of urinary stones in China, 2008 . 105 children were diagnosed as urinary system stones of screening 8335 children in our hospital. Continuous attention on their long-term prognosis should be stressed. Methods: Urolithiasis children were followed up after six and eighteen months respectively. We rechecked the patients' urinalysis, urinary system ultrasonography, urinary Ca/Cr, ALB/Cr, IgG/Cr and NAG/Cr. Results: 91.4% and 76.2% children engaged in the fi rst (six months later) and second follow-up (eighteen months later), respectively. Ultrasonography showed 68.9% patients had disappeared stones in the fi rst follow-up, as well as 86.1% patients did in the second, difference was signifi cant (P=0.012). Similar results was found in 61 patients who participated in both follow-ups (54.1%, 86.9%; P<0.001). 74.3% and 76.2% patients were tested urinary ALB/Cr, IgG/Cr and NAG/Cr in both follow-ups. The glomerular injury detection rate in the second one (8.9%) was obviously less than that in the fi rst one (32.1%, P<0.001), but it was no signifi cant difference in the renal tubular injury rate (17.9%, 16.1%; P>0.05). Moreover, all quantitative analysis of IgG/Cr, ALB/Cr and NAG/Cr had statistically signifi cance between them (P IgG/Cr =0.038, P ALBU/Cr <0.001 and P NAG/ Cr =0.026). Similar results were obtained from 58 patients who participated in both follow-ups (P IgG/Cr =0.015, P ALBU/Cr <0.001 and P NAG/Cr =0.029). Conclusions: Most Melamine-related urolithiasis children can excrete calculus spontaneously. Renal injury resulted by urolithiasis is reversible in most of them. The renal tubular injury should be paid more attention at further follow-up.",

Adverse events (AEs) were defi ned as any symptom during the study-period. Objectives: A total of 25 Chinese patients aged 6 to 36 months hospitalised at Beijing Children's Hospital due to melamine-induced kidney stones complicated by acute obstructive renal failure in 2008 were included in a study in order to diagnose and treat these special cases more effectively. Methods: Feeding history, clinical presentation, ultrasound fi ndings, treatments and effects were summarised. Twelve to seventeen months follow-up was reported also. Results: Ultrasound examination showed that calculi were located at the kidney and ureters. Stones were composed of both uric acid and melamine in a molar ratio of 1.2:1 to 2.1:1. Treatments providing liquid plus alkalisation of urine proved to be effective in helping the patients pass the stones. Surgical intervention was needed in severe cases. Renal function returned to normal in all 25 patients after various durations of therapy. Sixty-eight percent of the patients expelled all of the calculi within 3 months, 90% in 6 months and 95% in 9 months, without sequelae till the end of the follow-up. Conclusions: Melamine-contaminated milk formula can cause kidney stones in infants, which should be diagnosed by feeding history, clinical symptoms and ultrasound examination. Composition of the stones was not only of melamine but also uric acid. Providing liquid orally or intravenously plus alkalisation of urine proved to promote the removal of the stones. Follow-up of 12 to 17 months after discharge showed no sequelae. In adults with CKD, protein-energy wasting (PEW), characterized by a panoply of biochemical and nutritional indicators, has been implicated as a risk factor for death and cardiovascular disease. The clinical relevance of these markers in pediatric CKD populations is unknown. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children study (CKiD), a defi nition of PEW was developed using markers identifi ed from adult CKD populations. We assessed the prevalence of 7 indicators of PEW (anemia, poor weight growth, poor height growth, acidosis, low LDL, low dietary intake and hypoalbuminemia) and investigated the association of GFR and PEW using ordinal logistic regression. The relationship between severe PEW (\u2265 4 indicators) and blood pressure was also examined. Using data from 473 children we found 39 children with severe PEW (\u2265 4 indicators) accounting for 8% of the cohort. The most common PEW indicator was anemia, occurring in 38% of the cohort and 92% of those with severe PEW. Acidosis and hypoalbuminemia were present in the cohort population at 18% and 6%, respectively, and they were 4 and 9 times as likely to be found in those with severe PEW (P<0.001). PEW and GFR were also associated (for every 10 ml/min decrease in GFR the odds ratio for being in a higher category of PEW was 1.43 [1.30, 1.57]). Severe PEW was associated with a 10 point higher systolic blood pressure percentile for age, sex and height (P<0.05). Indicators of PEW were highly prevalent in the CKiD cohort of children with CKD, and PEW severity was associated with lower kidney function and higher blood pressure.",

Results: Of all analysed patients, urine protein to creatinine ratio was tested by primary care providers in 31.2% of cases. Overall, glomerular disease was identifi ed in 8.5% of all referred patients and 4% went on to have a renal biopsy done. 31.3% of patients on their initial visit to nephrologist were found not to have any suffi cient reason to be followed in renal clinic based on clinical and laboratory investigation. Among patients with protein to creatinine ratio done by their primary care providers, only 10.0% were not recommended to have followup with nephrology, and for those who had not had this study done, 40.9% were cleared after their initial visit (p<0.05). Glomerular pathology was found more often in patients referred with a urine protein to creatinine ratio already having been performed (18.1% vs 4.5%).

Objectives: Few literatures reported the incidence of ocular abnormalities in chronic renal failure (CRF).The aim of this paper is to determine the incidence of ocular abnormalities in childhood CRF. Methods: From January 1993 to July 2007, 80 patients with a diagnosis of chronic renal failure (CRF) were observed at the University Hospital in Al Kadhimiyia. They were examined to determine the presence of ocular abnormalities. Fifty one patients were males (63.75%) and 29 (36.25%) were females. The male-female ratio was 1.75, and the age at referral ranged from 2 months to 18 years (mean 9 years). Results: Corneal cystine crystals were the most common ocular abnormalities associated with childhood CRF occurring in 7.5% of the patients in association with Nephropathic cystinosis. Congenital cataract & glaucoma were observed in 3.75% of the patients in association with Oculo-cerebro-renal syndrome (OCRS). Objectives: The aim of this paper is to describe a new model for the management of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the developing world and its potential future role in the industrial countries when advancement in stem cell researches makes the need for long-term dialysis obsolete. Methods: During the period from January 1993 to July 2007, 80 patients with a diagnosis of chronic renal failure (CRF) were observed at the University Hospital in Al Kadhimiyia. Fifty one patients were males (63.75%) and 29 (36.25%) were females. The male-female ratio was 1.75, and the age at referral ranged from 2 months to 18 years (mean 9 years). Fourteen (16.5%) patients were treated a new therapeutic approach consisting of acacia gum supplementation plus the traditional conservative measures was used. Results: Amelioration of the uremic symptoms and lowering of blood urea levels delaying the need for dialysis was associated with this new therapy. In this sample of 80 patients the longest survival of 6 years was achieved in 2 patients, both treated initially with IPD. One of them was transplanted and the other was treated with the new therapeutic approach. Conclusions: It's a fact that with appropriate dietary and pharmacologic management, patients with non-terminal CRF can be maintained surprisingly well and the transition from non-terminal CRF to ESRD represents a small decrement of renal function resulting in a large physiologic hurdle for the patient. The addition to these effective traditional measures, an agent enhance fecal nitrogen excretion can possibly bridge this gap resulting from this small decrement of renal function obviating the need for dialysis for some period of time.",

Recent studies show the potential harm in using hypotonic solutions in children especially in diseased states like pneumonia. The choice of parenteral fl uids is usually dictated by the serum sodium and urine sodium. The objective is to determine the random serum sodium and urine sodium levels among children with pneumonia. Methods: Serum sodium, BUN and creatinine concentrations were obtained upon the patients' admission and blood sampling took place before starting any intravenous fl uid. Urine samples were also sent within 24 hours upon admission to the Philippine General Hospital laboratory for random urine sodium and creatinine levels. Fractional excrtetion of sodium will be computed. Results: Infants were found to be more affected with pneumonia with males predominating(73%). 60% of the subjects presented with normal serum sodium. The mean serum sodium was 142 mmol/L (SD 5.29 mmol/L) For the urine sodium, 70% had normal values. Mean urine sodium was 90.77 mmol/L (SD 69.51 mmol/L). 57% had low FeNa. Using the Fisher's exact test, the risk for abnormal serum sodium and urine sodium was higher in children than infants. Conclusions: Children with pneumonia have normal serum and urine sodium.

This therapy delays organ damage but may cause gastrointestinal side effects by hypersecretion of gastric acid. In laboratory rats it was found ulcerogenic. Methods: We report two severe gastrointestinal complications in a transplanted cystinosis patient treated with cysteamine. Results: A now 14-year-old girl with cystinosis received cysteamine since the age of 4 years. Doses ranged from 1.0 to 1.3 mg/m 2 /day; cystine concentrations in leucocytes were below 0.6 nmol/mg protein. Nevertheless she developed ESRD and was transplanted at the age of 9 years. Immunosuppression included prednisolone, tacrolimus, and 1 year MMF. At the age of 14, she was diagnosed with acute severe ulcerative colitis, necessitating subtotal colectomy despite intravenous steroids. Histopathology showed ulcerative lesions without cystine crystals. Cysteamine concentrations were normal. After an episode of acute tubular necrosis she developed duodenal ulcers with massive hematemesis. These were treated with blood transfusions and intervention duodenoscopy. Cysteamine therapy was then interrupted to promote healing of the duodenal ulcers. She was discharged after 2 months with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for the renal graft consisting of low dose steroids and tacrolimus, and with a half dose of cysteamine and omeprazole. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the fi rst report of duodenal ulcers in a cystinosis patient with cysteamine therapy (and the second on IBD). Although physical stress, steroids and uremia could all have contributed to the formation of duodenal ulcers, a possible role of cysteamine can-not be excluded.",

            "text": "The Objectives: Knowledge of number, location and size of renal stones is very important in predicting underlying causes and management of urolithiasis. The information about these issues in pediatric fi eld is scarce; therefore, we performed this study to evaluate these parameters in children with urolithiasis. Methods: 153 patients (82 boys and 71 girls) ranging in age from 2 months to 18 years (mean age =4.84 years \u00b14.81) with documented renal stones were enrolled in this prospective cross-sectional study. The number, location and size of the stones were determined by ultrasonography in at least 2 sessions. Results: 62 patients (40.5%) had one, 65 (42.5%) had two and 26 (17%) had three stones or more.The stones were bilateral in 56 patients (36.6%). Out of 244 stones, 127 were located on the right side and 117 on the left side. Of total stones, 241 (98.8%) were located in the kidneys; 103 (42.7%) of these stones were in the middle parts, 97 (40.2%) in lower poles and 41 (17%) in the upper poles of the kidneys. 3 ureteral stones were found while no pelvis or bladder stone was detected. Considering the greatest diameter of the stones, 107 patients (69.9%) had stones less than 5 mm, 7 (4.6%) had stones less than 5 mm and also stones measuring 5-10 mm, 35(22.9%) only had stones measuring 5-10 mm and 4 (2.6%) had stones greater than 10 mm. Conclusions: Compared with the previous reports, large stones are less frequent in this study and bilateral stones, the usual indicators of underlying metabolic disorders, are relatively more common; furthermore, the renal stones are less commonly located in upper poles of the kidneys and the ureters. evaluations of blood and urine were done for all of the patients. Results: 139 patients (90.8%) had at least one related metabolic abnormality. The frequencies of these abnormalities in decreasing order were as following: hypomagnesuria (n=93, 60.8%), hypocitraturia (n=81, 52.9%), hypercalciuria (n=72, 47.1%), hyperuricosuria( n=57, 37.3%), hypernatriuria ( n=52, 34.4%), hyperoxaluria( n=26, 17%), renal tubular acidosis( n=10, 6.5%), hyperuricemia(n=7, 4.6%) and cystinuria (n=3, 2 %). Anatomical abnormalities were detected in 6 patients; of these patients, 5 had associated metabolic abnormalities. Conclusions: In contrast to previous reports, higher proportion of our patients have underlying metabolic abnormalities, even in those with anatomical abnormalities. Furthermore, in other reports, hypercalciuria is the most frequent abnormality associated with urolithiasis; however, in our study, hypomagnesuria and hypocitraturia are more common.",

The aim of the study was to describe renal outcome and to highlight long term prognostic factors for D+HUS patients and \u226510 years follow-up. Methods: Initial data as well as renal function tests at 6 months and at 1 year were collected for 219 patients admitted for D+HUS between 1972 and 1998. Renal function were assessed in these patients between 2007 and 2009 and they were classifi ed in 3 groups according to the level of GFR: CKD0 (no chronic kidney disease), CKD1 (proteinuria/ microalbuminuria/ hypertension, normal GFR); CKD2-5 (GFR 80-0 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2). Results: Data from 140 of 210 surviving patients were available with a median follow up of 18.7 years after HUS. Among them, 62 patients (45%) belonged to CKD0, 46 (33%) to CKD1, and 32 (22%) to CKD2-5. Median follow-up was respectively 17.3, 18.2, and 22.7 years*. Multivariate analysis showed that anuria \u22658 days*, need of dialysis*, serum creatinine >60\u00b5mol/L 1 month after HUS* were factors of poor long term renal outcome *(p<0,01). In contrast complete recovery of renal function by 1 year after D+HUS was not a reliable marker of favourable outcome. Conclusions: By 20 years of follow up, 55% of patients with a history of D+HUS present CKD. The signifi cant difference in the duration of follow-up between groups suggest that the rate of CKD worsen with time and that some patients currently in CKD1 are at risk to develop CKD2-5 in the next decade. We suggest that all D+HUS patients should benefi t of a life long follow-up even in case of complete recovery of renal function in the year following HUS.",

Hyponatremia is multifactorial and frequent in patients treated with large hypotonic IV fl uids. Acute leukemia diagnosis, vincristine and diuretic administration, and initial low serum sodium should be considered as risk factors. Objectives: A consensus has emerged that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) exert renoprotective effects through anti-hypertensive and anti-proteinuric properties in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is not clear, however, whether CKD with a lower rate of urinary protein excretion like congenital kidney malformations benefi t from the RAS blockers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the renoprotective effects of the RAS blockers to slow renal deterioration in children with hypodysplastic nephropathies. Methods: We studied 8 patients with stage 2 to 4 CKD for bilateral hypodysplastic nephropathies, who ranged from 6.1 to 16.0 years old at the start of the treatment. Hypertension was present in 3 patients, 2 suffered moderate proteinuria and 5 had only mild proteinuria before the treatment. Four patients received ACEI and the rest were treated with ARB. Results: After the mean follow-up of 35 months, all the patients are on treatment. 3 patients with hypertension have shown enough decrements in blood pressure to be within normal range and mild proteinuria decreased in 3 of the 5 patients. The slope of the reciprocal serum creatinine (1/ Cr) curve fi t showed slowed deterioration in 3 patients. None developed adverse events such as hyperkalaemia.",

Large scale investigation is needed to further clarify the disease. Methods: Prospective case control research on children less than 36 months old screened for urolithiasis was performed in 6 centers in China. Children with urolithiasis, without congenital abnormality of urinary tract and history of renal diseases were included as cases. Controls were randomly sampled according to the case: control ratio of 1:1. The risk factors, stone status and manifestations were reassessed. Results: There were 1329 cases and 1317 controls with a mean age of 18.4 months. For melamine associated urolithiasis, we confi rmed that the factors of high melamine formula and preterm were risk factors, symptoms were lacking and most of urinalysis was normal. We also found children more than 1 year old were 0.538 times unlikely to have stones than younger; children fed together with breast milk have around one half chance to have stones than children fed only with formula. Children with symptom of vomiting or diarrhea were more likely to have stones. Most of stones were small and located at kidney. Children fed with high melamine formula were nearly twice more likely to have large stones. Conclusions: High melamine formula and preterm infant were confi rmed to be risk factors for stones. New identifi ed infl uencing factors were age, breast milk, and vomiting or diarrhea. Children less than 1 year old were at high risk to have stones and were recommended to be fed with breast milk. Objectives: Hemolytic and Uremic Syndrome related to Pneumococcal infection (HUS-P) is a rare condition.

Methods: A prospective study of 223 pediatric pts to examine renal manifestations of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (HSP). The pts' condition was monitored with 5 outpatient visits and urine dipstick tests at home. Of the pts 111 did not receive any medication, 89 were treated with prednisone prophylaxis and 24 either with Cyclosporine-A or MP-pulses due to severe HSN. Results: HSN occurred in 102/223(46%) of the pts consisting of isolated hematuria in 14%, proteinuria in 9%, both hematuria and proteinuria in 56%, nephrotic-range proteinuria in 20% and nephrotic-nephritic syndrome in one case. Nephritis occurred mean 14 days after HSP diagnosis and in 87% within one month. The incidence after 1 and 2 months was 14% and 2%, respectively. The occurrence of HSN increased with age, p<0.001 for linear trend. In multivariate analysis the risk factors for nephritis were age > 8yrs (OR 2.7, p=0.002, Cl 1.4-5.1), abdominal pain (OR 2.1, p=0.017, Cl 1.1-3.7) and HSP recurrences (OR 3.1, p=0.002, Cl 1.5-6.3). Pts with 2 or 3 risk factors developed nephritis in 63% and 87% of cases. Laboratory tests or blood pressure at onset did not predict HSN. Early prednisone treatment did not affect the frequency or timing of nephritis. Conclusions: Weekly urine dipstick tests are indicated for 2 months after the HSP diagnosis. Patients > 8yrs, with abdominal pain or HSP recurrences have higher risk for HSN. However, early renal dysfunction may be overlooked using that method.",

Only if one of the two specimens appeared too small, we try to obtain a third one. We obtained two specimens in 23 cases (60,3%), and three specimens in 35 cases (39,7%). Pathologic evaluation was based chiefl y on the combination of the light microscopic observation with immunofl uorescence microscopy data. In 35 cases electron microscopy was performed too. Results: Mean number of glomeruli per specimen was 25,3 \u00b1 14,5 [6-65]. Pathological fi ndings included 5 minimal change diseases (8,6%), 7 FSGS (12,1%), 18 IgA-nephropathy (31,0%), 2 membranous glomerulonephritis (3.4%), 8 crescentic glomerulonephritis (13.8%), 4 Alport syndrome (6,9%), 6 thin basement membrane disease (10,4%), 2 trombotic microangiopathy (3,4%) and 6 other lesions (10.4%). Minor complications (gross hematuria and/or perinephric hematoma resolving without the need for transfusion or intervention) occurred in 16 patients (27.6%). No major complications were noted. Conclusions: A renal biopsy in pediatric patients is a safe, reliable and minimally invasive procedure. The results supplemented our knowledge of renal diseases in children in the Orenburg region.",

Though pathogenesis of susceptibility to bacterial infection remains unknown, multiple predisposing factors including defective opsonisation, altered T cell function, altered IgG concentrations have been proposed. Albumin is worthy of note because it plays an important role in the host immunity as one of the important antioxidants. This study was condcted to investigate whether hypoalbuminemia contributes to declined immunity in INS. Methods: Thirty fi ve heparinised blood samples were obtained from 4 patients with INS aged 10-15 years at the time of relapse or remission. Serum levels of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) and biological antioxidant potentials (BAP) were measured by spectrophotometry using a novel analyzer, FRAS4 (Diacron Int., Italy). Serum albumin level (HSA) was measured by colorimetric assay. Relationships between HSA and ROM, BAP, and ROM/BAP ratio were studied. Results: HSA varied from 0.8 to 4.4 g/dL, and correlated with ROM and BAP (p<0.01). Correlation coeffi cient between HSA and BAP (r s = 0.74) was higher than that between HSA and ROM (r s = 0.43). In addition, HSA correlated inversely with ROM/BAP ratio (r s = 0.31, p<0.05).",

Objectives: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of renal failure in the world and is becoming more prevalent in the young. It has previously been considered a hyperglycaemic complication directed against the renal microvasculature.

Results: These animals develop signifi cant albuminuria with increased matrix production, mesangial expansion, loss of podocyte cytoskeletal architecture, thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and glomerulosclerosis. Thus, elimination of insulin signaling in podocytes alone is suffi cient to recapitulate the major features of DN despite normoglycaemia. Our studies suggest that the mechanism of this effect involves dynamic control of actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the podocyte by insulin receptor signaling. Conclusions: Collectively this shows the critical contribution of altered insulin signaling in the podocyte in the pathogenesis of DN. Thus, therapies that improve the insulin sensitivity of this cell could have great potential in treating this major global health problem. Objectives: CD2AP is a multifunctional adaptor molecule, and plays a crucial role in the kidney where it is essential for ultrafi ltration functions of the slit-diaphragm complex. Knockout of CD2AP in mice leads to nephrotic syndrome. The role of CD2AP in podocytes is not known.

Nephrin, CD2AP, Podocin and WT1 were expressed at comparable level in both cell lines. Mesenchymal markers (fi bronectin and \u03b1-SMA) were signifi cantly overexpressed in mutant podocytes, while in WT they were expressed at low but detectable levels. PAX-2 was expressed in CD2AP mutant cells and not in WT podocytes. Mechanistically, WTIP was shown to translocate to the nucleus in mutant cells. Conclusions: Fibroblast like morphology of the mutant cells, disturbance of the cell sheets and overexpression of EMT markers and re-expression of PAX2 indicate that the CD2AP mutation may have led to podocyte dedifferentiation. We showed that normally CD2AP recruits WTIP to the cell membrane, whereas a mutant involved in human disease shuttles it to the nucleus where it suppresses WT1-dependent gene expression to permit simplifi cation of podocyte phenotype. This is a novel role for CD2AP, with implications for its role in development and progression of glomerular disease. Objectives: TGF-\u03b2 plays a central role in renal fi brogenesis. We previously showed in vitro that PI3K and TGF-\u03b2 stimulated Smad3 activity lead to collagen I expression, and now aimed to extend these fi ndings to an in-vivo model. Results: Balb/c mice treated with ADR (0.15 mg, iv) showed massive albuminuria and advanced global glomerulosclerosis, as described by others. We found increased renal mRNA for TGF-\u03b21, type I collagen, fi bronectin and smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (\u03b1SMA). Immunoblotting showed phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream marker for PI3K activity. A PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (25mg/kg, i.p, 2x/week), prevented ADR-induced histological changes, albuminuria, and upregulation of fi brosis markers.

Smad3 phosphorylation, and nuclear localization shown by immunostaining, implicated TGF-\u03b2. A TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, soluble human TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor (sT\u03b2RII.Fc), protected 129/sj mice from ADR-induced histological changes and diminished collagen I and \u03b1SMA mRNA expression, but did not prevent proteinuria.

During presumed viral infections,patients in Gr.I were advised to take the same dose of prednisolone every day for 7 consecutive days; patients in Gr. C continued to receive ad prednisolone. Relapse (3+ proteinuria for 3 consecutive days) was considered infection-associated if it occurred within 2-wks of onset of viral illness. Patients were followed up for 12-mo. Results: For 100 patients included, Gr. I (n=50) showed signifi cantly lower relapse rates (mean difference 0.9 episodes/pt/yr; 95% CI 0.4-1.4) at 12-mo.The number of infection-associated relapses was signifi cantly lower in Gr. I (mean difference 0.7; 95% CI 0.3-1.1).The increase in relapses with the number of infections was more apparent in Gr.C. An adjustment for occurrence of infections, showed that daily administration of prednisolone during viral infections independently resulted in 59% reduction in rate of relapses (rate ratio 0.41; 95% CI 0.3-0.6). The intervention is likely to reduce the number of relapses to < 3 in 12 months, for one out of six children treated. Conclusions: Daily administration of maintenance doses of prednisolone, during viral infections, signifi cantly reduces relapse rates and the proportion of children with FRNS. Objectives: Elucidation of the role of the p38 MAPK/MK-2 signaling pathway in mediating nephrotic syndrome-related podocyte injury induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). Methods: PAN-induced injury of cultured podocytes was monitored by measuring cell viability and integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Podocytes were treated with specifi c inhibitors, SB203580 and C23, to block the activity of p38 MAPK and MK-2, respectively. Electrophoretic analyses were used to verify the effects of these drugs in podocytes. Results: PAN-induced loss of podocyte viability was signifi cantly prevented by inhibition of p38 MAPK or MK-2. In addition, inhibition of p38 MAPK or MK-2 almost completely prevented PAN-induced disruption of podocyte actin fi laments. At the molecular level, both inhibitors markedly reduced basal phosphorylation of the MK-2 substrate Hsp25, suggesting that prevention of PAN-induced injury indeed was due to inhibition of this signaling cascade. In addition, we found that exposure of podocytes to serum albumin strongly activated p38 MAPK/ MK-2 signaling which suggests that this pathway may contribute to cell damage resulting from protein overload. Conclusions: Collectively, these data suggest a direct role of p38 MAPK/MK-2 signaling in mediating podocyte injury resulting from treatment with PAN or serum albumin. Consequently, specifi c pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK or MK-2 offers a potentially novel therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat podocyte injury in nephrotic syndrome. (25%)]. Ultrasonography showed increased echogencity in 9(20%) and increased kidney size in 9(23%).

Objectives: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis is a welldescribed model of human idiopathic nephrotic syndrome because PAN injection into rats results in increased glomerular permeability with the characteristic ultrastructural changes in glomerular epithelial cells (GEpC; podocytes) similar to human nephrosis. We investigated the role of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and oxidative stress on PANinduced podocyte phenotypical changes and hyperpermeability in vitro. Methods: Rat GEpCs were incubated in media containing various concentrations of PAN. The phenotypical changes of ZO-1were analyzed by confocal imaging, Western blotting, and PCR. We also examined in vitro permeability and oxidative stress level. Results: Morphological assessment revealed that in vitro PAN not only induced the ultrastructural changes of GEpC, such as shortening and fusion of microvilli, but also separated the intercellular gaps and linear ZO-1 resulting in increased intercellular permeability. Oxidative stress level after PAN treatment was markedly higher than that of basal level. PAN induced the inner cytoplasmic translocation of ZO-1 protein and also reduced ZO-1 protein amount and mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. These phenotypical changes of podocyte caused by PAN were augmented by the antioxidative effect of vitamin C.",

Methods: We report the case of a 4 year old boy, diagnosed with atypical HUS due to an hybrid factor H. Results: He progressed to end-stage renal disease despite plasmatherapy and underwent bilateral nephrectomy because of uncontrolled hypertension. Three days after, he had complex seizures with normal blood pressure, normal blood count and normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which recurred 1 month later. 8 months later, he had a third episode of seizures, with hemoglobin of 10g/ dl without schizocyte, low haptoglobin of 0.2g/l, and moderate thrombocytopenia (platelets 98.10 9 /L). He remained deeply confused during 2 days. The third MRI showed bilateral symmetrical hyperintensities of the cerebral pedonculae, caudate nuclei, putamens, thalami, hippocampi and insulae suggesting thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to a relapse of HUS rather than RPLS, usually occipital and asymmetrical. He was treated with daily plasma exchanges (PE) that led to a complete neurological recovery within 2 days although hypertension had remained uncontrolled. After 10 sessions, PE were replaced by weekly plasma infusions. The fourth MRI 10 weeks after was normal and clinical examination remained normal, except for high blood pressure. Objectives: Epidemiological data show a signifi cantly better renal prognosis for women with chronic glomerular diseases compared to men. Regarding the critical role of podocytes for pathogenesis, we studied the infl uences of estrogens on podocyte function.

Cultured murine podocytes were treated with Puromycin (PAN) to induce apoptosis, Estradiol (E2) alone or both combined. Apoptotic cells were quantifi ed by FACS analysis and Hoechst nuclear staining. Results: ER\u03b1 mRNA and protein were detected in podocytes. In vitro, E2 reduced PAN-induced apoptosis by 27% (p=0.01, FACS). Hoechst staining showed similar results (57% reduction of apoptosis, p=0.01). In human biopsies, low ER expression in podocytes was found in 45-55% of controls and MCGN patients (gender-independent).

Conclusions: RGC-32 protein located in cytoplasm of proximal tubular and distal renal tubular in renal tissues fi rstly. The expression of RGC-32 was positive correlation with the degree of renal lesions and tubulointerstitial injury in children with IgAN, and it is concordance to the expression of \u03b1-SMA and TGF-\u03b21. Thus it was hinted that RGC-32 may participate in the course of TGF-induced EMT of renal tubular cells. Objectives: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is an effective agent for frequently relapsing steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (FR-SDNS), but its use can also be complicated by renal toxicity. Because no biochemical markers from urine or blood samples have yet been established for detecting CsA-induced renal injury to date, repeated renal biopsies are therefore required for all patients with long-term CsA treatment. The purpose of the present study was therefore to detect early change of CsA nephropathy (CsAN) using blood samples. Methods: Several biochemical markers were analyzed in an attempt to examine the renal function in 24 patients with FR-SDNS who had been treated with CsA. Those included serum cystatin C and indoxyl sulfate, as well as creatinine and b2-microglobulin. of MYH9 mutation and hematologic evaluation were performed. A renal biopsy was performed on the elder brother. Immunofl uorescence microscopy (IF) added anti-alpha1 to 6 antibody of collagen type 4, monoclonal antibody against nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMMHC-IIA) and antibody of nehrin and podocin. Results: In blood, electron microscopy (EM) of leukocyte inclusion bodies revealed parallel fi laments. IF showed NMMHC-IIA antibodies in 1 leukocyte inclusion bodies. These fi ndings consistent with MHA and they were identifi ed to express the MYH9 mutation, D1424H. In the elder boy, the histology revealed mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with granular deposits of IgG and C1q. EM showed the dense deposits located in subendothelial cells, mesangial cells and Bowman's capsule. NMMHC-IIA antibodies were localized in podocyte and endothelial cells. The expression of nephrin and podocin was normal. His condition had a temporary effect for steroid therapy, but became refractory proteinuria later. Conclusions: About immune complex-related nephropathy, we concluded that an infl ammatory mechanism occur separately from MHA. (3 cm) in the left, and multiple metastases in the lungs.

Serum Alb decreased to 2.1 g/dl as the proteinuria increased to 30 in Pr/Cr (mg/mg) ratio. He underwent right nephrectomy after two monthlong chemotherapy. The proteinuria gradually decreased, and the serum Alb increased to 3.6 g/dl by 2 months after surgery. His renal function was stable. His hypertension was controlled by ARB and Ca blocker, and nephrectomy seemed also effective. Genetic analysis of the tumor revealed a homizygous mutation of R390X in WT1 gene. Results: FGS was noted in 3 out of 50 glomeruli. Accumulation of podocytes around the collapsing tuft, and hyaline droplets in podocytes were observed,suggesting the podocyte injury. EM revealed foot process effacement in some capillary walls.",

Objectives: The purpose of our study was to work out a method of quantitative assessment of IHC staining in kidney glomeruli taking only cell volume into account. Methods: 31 needle renal biopsy specimens from children with nephrotic syndrome were studied. Histologically minimal change disease, mesangioproliferative nephropathy, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were diagnosed. IHC staining of specimens for podocalyxin was performed. Images of 5 glomeruli in the section were taken at a x400 magnifi cation and further analyzed using WCIF ImageJ 1.42q software. The glomerular area (GA) was calculated by drawing a region of interest around the glomerulus. Capillary lumen area (CLA) of glomerulus was calculated using color based thresholding. Cellular area (CA) was determined as a difference between GA and CLA. The number of positive pixels was calculated using color based thresholding with a spectrum specifi c for the diaminobenzidine staining. Staining density was stated as a number of positive pixels per square micrometer of CA. Results: Podocalyxin immunostaining was found in glomeruli along the membranes of podocytes and endotheliocytes. Staining density was calculated for each specimen and the mean was 29.68\u00b117.78 pixels per square micrometer. Mean staining density calculated per GA was 20.09\u00b112.74. This data shows that staining density per CA is more variable than per GA. This may have infl uence on the results of investigation of IHC markers expression in glomeruli.",

The ability to noninvasively screen for either AR or BK nephritis provides ease and fl exibility for ongoing pediatric transplant monitoring, identifying patients in need of attention and possible intervention by a transplant nephrologist. Objectives: Kidney transplant in patients with aHUS is associated with a poor outcome because of recurrent disease, especially in patients known to have a factor H mutation. Long-term prophylactic plasma exchange (PE) and combined liver-kidney transplant have prevented graft loss caused by recurrence. However, the mortality associated with liver transplant is not negligible, and prophylactic PE requires permanent vascular access and regular hospitalization and exposes the patient to allergic reactions to plasma. Eculizumab is a high-affi nity humanized monoclonal anti-C5 antibody that prevents C5a and MAC formation. We report the use of eculizumab instead of PE to prevent aHUS recurrence after transplantation in a patient with highly plasma-dependent aHUS related with a CFH mutation. Methods: A 17 years old girl with aHUS associated with CFH mutation and ESRF since the age of 3 y presenting with multiple cerebral vascular stenosis, PE dependency and severe allergic reactions to plasma after a third kidney transplantation received 900 mg of eculizumab intravenously 2 h after the last PE.The same dose of eculizumab was given weekly for 4 weeks. Thereafter, 1,200 mg was given every 2 weeks indefi nitely. Anti-meningococcus vaccination was performed prior to eculizumab. Results: Twelve months after the start of eculizumab and PE discontinuation, no relapse had occurred and plasma creatinine level is stable at 128 micromol/L. Methods: Early (G1,n=9) and late (G4,n=5) generation male Terc KO kidneys were transplanted into female WT recipients and sacrifi ced after 6 wks. Results: G4 transplants showed signifi cantly more interstitial fi brosis (IF) and a tendency to more glomerulosclerosis. Telomere-dependent senescence markers were signifi cantly higher in G4: more H2AX pos. tubular cells (fi g.1A), higher p21 expression (fi g.1B). p16 refl ecting telomere-independent senescence, even though higher in G4 prior to tx, was not different after tx (fi g.1C).",

This was more pronounced leading to increased IF in G4 mice that refl ect the situation of an old donor. But p16 increases in G1 suggest that senescence can be triggered even in ideal donors. As this tx model enables us to mimic the human situation, it should be used to explore factors that reduce regeneration even in optimal transplants. Results: LVMi at HD onset was 101\u00b15.7 g/m 2 . After one year on HD there was a signifi cant decrease (89 4.5 g/m 2 ) and stabilization until renal transplantation (86.3\u00b14.7 g/m 2 ). Six months post transplant a dramatic re-increase was noticed (104\u00b19.0 g/m 2 ) followed by a decrease until two year post RT (83.5 g/m 2 ). After the second year post transplant LVM developed very heterogeneously (99\u00b110.0 g/ m 2 ), and a subset of patients had moderate to severe LVH. In the HD period LVM was positively correlated with mean, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (MBP, SBP, and DBP), but not with Hb levels. However, in the post RT period only correlation with SBP was identifi ed, but surprisingly not with DBP, MBP, or renal function. There was no difference in patients with CyA or FK based immunosuppression. The risk to have a LVH one year post RT was partially predictable by LVM at the beginning of the HD period (p<0.01). Conclusions: LVH decreases during HD and re-appears after the second year post transplant in about 50% of patients in particular those with severe LVH at the beginning of the HD period. ESA use was documented in 9 patients all of whom were treated with MMF (9/31 -29%). Conclusions: Early post transplant anaemia is common in paediatric renal allograft recipients.

Methods: To report the successful outcome of pre-emptive living related renal transplantation in a 6.5 year old boy with CKD due to renal dysplasia who developed anti-erythropoietin antibodies (anti-epo Abs) resulting in transfusiondependent PRCA. Results: He was on subcutaneous erythropoietin beta for two years but two months prior to transplantation, his haemoglobin was 4.6g/dl with reticulocytes of 0.1% requiring his fi rst blood transfusion. His bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy one month before renal transplantation confi rmed PRCA (other causes excluded). His erythropoietin beta was discontinued and he had high titres of anti-epo Abs. He received his second blood transfusion before his renal transplant. He underwent a living related renal transplantation from his maternal uncle (mismatch 011) using triple immunosuppression. His anti-epo Abs reduced further two weeks post-transplantation but required his third blood transfusion. He is six months post-transplant with haemoglobin of 11.6g/dl, ferritin of 363mcg/l, negative anti-epo Abs and good renal allograft function (eGFR of 74mls/min/1.73m 2 ).

We analysed 2 groups of pediatric kidney recipients (R): one including patients treated with Basiliximab and corticosteroids, the other recipients receiving exclusively corticosteroid pulse induction. Immunosuppression in both groups was based on CsA or FK506 \u00b1 MMF \u00b1 corticosteroids. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 130 paediatric kidney recipients: 78 (60%) treated with Basiliximab (R/D age 12\u00b17/15\u00b18 yrs, HLA mismatches 3.6\u00b10.9) and 52 (40%) with only corticosteroid pulses (R/D age 15\u00b15/13\u00b110 yrs, HLA mismatches 3.1\u00b11.06). Results: Patients who received IL-2 receptor-antagonist induction had lower incidence of acute clinical rejections (p=0.0049). Steroid withdrawal at 12 and 24 months post-transplant was possible in a larger number of patients receiving Basiliximab then corticosteroid pulses (p=0.0015 and p=0.0001). No differences in terms of organ survival, creatinine clearance, acute/chronic subclinical lesions at protocol biopsies, mean corticosteroids dosage, CsA/FK506 blood through levels, and growth at 6, 12 and 24 months post-transplant. Conclusions: Our results highlight that the use of IL-2-receptor antagonists allows an early corticosteroid withdrawal and confi rm an higher effi cacy of Basiliximab in preventing clinical acute rejections. We found no differences regarding the prevalence of post-transplant short or long term acute and chronic histological lesions. Objectives: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most frequent acquired disease resulting in ESRD in children. The risk of recurrence in the allograft is reported to be \u223c30%. Podocine gene mutations are well-known to be a protective factor for FSGS recurrence.

Pediatric Nephrology, H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France. Objectives: Vascular thrombosis is responsible for at least 10% of early graft failures. Factors that increase the risk include a thrombophylic state, a recipient less than 5 years or less than 15 kgBW, a donor aged less than 5 years, several arteries, history of prior transplantation or vascular rejection. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the benefi ts and risks of systematic anticoagulation in renal transplant recipients. Methods: From March 2001 to January 2007, 116 renal transplants were performed in 112 patients aged 1.2 to 21.5 years (mean 10.3). Two patients with early graft loss were excluded as well as 4 pts who did not receive anticoagulants. Exaparine was started between 12 and 24 hours after surgery and continued during 3 weeks in 110 children. Results: One graft was lost from artery thrombosis in a 18 year old patient following a cadaveric transplantation (0.89%). The graft had two arteries. No other risk factor was present and antiX a activity was 0.41. Ten patients had bleeding complications (perirenal or intra renal hematoma, wound hematoma, digestive bleeding) necessitating blood transfusion ( Objectives: The number of acute rejections and infections after pediatric kidney transplantation could not be reduced in the last years. In order to improve these parameters, we investigated a new immunosuppressive protocol in a prospective, controlled trial. Methods: Twenty children were treated with Basilximab, CsA (trough-level=C0 200-250 ng/ml) and Prednisolone at the time of Tx. After 2 weeks, CsA dose was reduced to 50% (C0 50-100 ng/ml, after 6 months: 50-75 ng/ml) and Everolimus (1.6 mg/m\u00b2/d) was started (C0 3-6 ng/ml). Six months after Tx, Prednisolone was stopped. Results: All 20 protocol biopsies showed no acute rejection or borderline fi ndings. had ATN was found in 4 of 8 indication biopsies, two had borderline fi ndings, one 5% interstitial fi brosis, one was normal. Mean GFR 1 year after Tx was 71 \u00b1 25 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2. The number of serious adverse events, infections and gastrointestinal problems was signifi cantly lower as compared to a historic age matched cohort that was treated with normal-dose CsA, MMF and steroids. Without CMV-prophylaxis, only 2 primary CMV infections were seen despite a donor-CMV+, recipient-CMV-constellation in 10/20 children. Conclusions: In pediatric kidney transplantation primary immunosuppression with low dose CsA, Everolimus and steroid withdrawal after 6 months leads an absence of acute rejections and a reduction in infections, especially CMV.",

Objectives: Transplant ureteric stents (TUS) reduce the incidence of urological complications post-operatively. However, there can be complications with TUS (UTI, migration, haematuria and pain) which may be related to how long the TUS remains in situ. We assessed two techniques for TUS removal in an aim to determine optimal timing for TUS removal. Objectives: BK Virus associated nephropathy (BKVAN) causes allograft dysfunction and graft loss.Treatment of BKVAN is not well defi ned.We report our experience with kidney transplant recipients, who developed BKVAN, the diagnosis, study and treatment. Methods: Retrospective case report. Results: Two female, aged 8, 11 and 9 yr respectively developed BKVAN at 24, 12 and 3 months after kidney transplant.All received, polyclonal antibody therapy, MMF, tacrolimus and prednisone. Both female have insidious rise of creatinine, at 12 and 24 months.The male had an abrupt rise in creatinine at the third month. All treated initially with intravenous methylprednisolone.BK viral DNA measure from plasma by quantitative PCR assay and allograft biopsy consistent with polyoma virus infection.Imunosuppression reduction and IVIg was administered. The fi rst patient also received ciprofl oxacin 4 weeks, but had progressive deterioration of renal function and BK PCR failed to decrease. Second patient received 6 course of cidofovir (0.25-0.50 mg/kg/dose), every 2 wk, and plasma viral load decreased to undetectable levels. Serum creatinine remained on average close to 2 mg/dl. Tthird patient BK viremia cleared with the immunnosuppression reduction and IVIg administration, but a month after had a rise in plasma BK viral DNA, initiating cidofovir.The plasma BK PCR began to decrease. Conclusions: BKVAN should be suspected in patients with graft dysfunction, especially those who receive aggressive induction. Cidofovir is effective in reducing BK viral load.

Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the effi cacy and safety of SRL in 8 pediatric renal transplant recipients (6 girls/ 2 boys),who were 10.90 \u00b1 4.01 years at time of transplantation and received a CNI as the core immunosuppression. Results: The patients were converted to SRL at 3.8 \u00b1 2.5 years posttransplantation. The indication for SRL therapy was chronic allograft nephropathy, in 3 of them due to calcineurin toxicity (37.5 %). Sirolimus was initiated at 1 to 2 mg/m 2 given orally once daily. Mean follow-up after the switch to SRL was 1 year. Patients and graft survival was 100%. No children experienced acute rejection episodes. The mean serum creatinin (Cr) at the time of switch to sirolimus was 179.6\u00b163 umol/l and decreased slowly during receiving SRL to 147.6 \u00b153.3 umol/l after 12 months of treatment (n.s.). We observed slight improvement in glomerular fi ltration rate assessed using the Schwartz formula at 1 month (42.4 \u00b112.6 v.s. 54.9 \u00b123.8 ml/ml/1.73m2), which was sustained thereafter. No serious adverse events were observed. Proteinuria increased signifi cantly (p<0.05), however, no signifi cant changes in serum cholesterol and trombocytes have been found. Although the prevalence of hypertensive patients decreased during follow-up, it was not signifi cant. Conclusions: Sirolimus as a concomitant immunosuppressant is effective in chronic allograft nephropathy. Further data are needed in pediatric transplantation recipients to best assess the role of TOR inhibition in corticosteroid and/or calcineurin inhibitor-sparing regimens. Objectives: The Cylex Immunoknow\u00ae Assay (IK) measures cell mediated immunity in transplant recipients by determining ATP generation in PHA stimulated CD4 cells. We report a single center study of the utility of IK to predict rejection or viral infection and to identify predictors of IK levels. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 67 renal transplant patients (pt) ages 1-20 from 11/06 to 12/09. Results: 494 IK were performed on 67 pt ( average 5\u00b13.6 tests/pt). The mean IK level was 362\u00b1151 ng/ml comparable to the adult normal range of 226-525 ng/ ml. In pt < 12 years IK was 350\u00b1149 and in pt >12 years was 369\u00b1152 (p>0.5). African American (AA) pt had lower IK compared to all other races (p=0.004).

Results: A 7 years old boy underwent a transperitoneal deceased donor renal transplant (DDRT) with venous anastomosis to portal vein. CA was diagnosed 2 months later on paracentesis. Feeds were changed to Medium Chain Triglyceride (MCT) formula. Ascites re-accumulated so feeds were held & total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was provided with some benefi t. CA recurred after introduction of low fat diet & paracentesis was done 4 times over 3 months. At 5 months post-DDRT a peritoneo-venous shunt (Denver) was placed. Shunt malfunction led to revision at 3 months & replacement after 4 months. To prevent malfunction, shunt was pumped frequently. A right sided chylothorax was managed symptomatically. At his last follow up at 16 months post-DDRT, CA was still present; otherwise he was doing well. Objectives: Renal transplantation in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) associated with factor H mutation is characterized by a high rate of disease recurrence and subsequent graft loss. Here we present a case of prophylactic use of the humanized monoclonal anti C5 antibody Eculizumab in renal transplantation. Methods: Eculizumab monitoring was performed with the measurement of the terminal complement complex (TCC, C5b-9) in serum, plasma and after zymosan activation (ELISA). Results: In November 2008 a ten year old boy with aHUS associated with a heterozygous factor H mutation received a deceased donor kidney. Immunosuppression included prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. Before and after transplantation daily plasma exchange was performed until Eculizumab was available on day 10 after renal transplantation. 600mg i.v. was administered every second or every third week until present. Eculizumab managed to normalize platelets and complement immediately. For the treatment period of 16 months an excellent renal function, no recurrence and no need for plasma therapy can be reported. Objectives: MPA acts as a specifi c inhibitor of human lymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting IMPDH. Outcome after renal transplantation (RTx) has been shown to depend on pretransplant IMPDH activity in adults. We investigated a potential developmental regulation of IMPDH during childhood. Methods: We analyzed IMPDH activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by HPLC (normalized to the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) content of the cells) in 27 healthy infants (2-5.9 yrs), 31 school-age children (6-11.9 yrs), 22 adolescents (12-17.9 yrs) and 106 adults. Pretransplant IMPDH activity was obtained from 31 children and 81 adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 12 hours PK/PD profi les of MPA and IMPDH after RTx were obtained in 17 children and 21 adults under MPA therapy. Results: IMPDH activity displayed high interindividual variability (coeffi cient of variation 40.5%). Median IMPDH did not differ signifi cantly in healthy infants (80.5 micro-mol/s/mol AMP), school-age children (60.6), adolescents (82.7) and adults (83.1). Pretransplant IMPDH was comparable in children (median 83.8) and adults with ESRD (92.0). IMPDH activity was inversely correlated with MPA plasma concentration in both children and adults. Conclusions: There is no pronounced developmental regulation of IMPDH activity in PBMCs in children. MPA inhibits IMPDH in children and adults to a comparable extent. The analysis of IMPDH activity prior to RTx may optimize MPA therapy.",

Pediatric Department, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France. Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between Corticosteroid (CS) and renal function and growth in pediatric renal transplant recipients. Methods: Data were extracted from the French pediatric database for renal transplantation (DIVAT). Children with a functional graft one year after a fi rst transplantation from Jan 1995 to Oct 2007 were included. CS was calculated as a Mean CS Dose per day (MCSD), and was divided into 3 classes: low (<0.1mg/ kg/d), intermediate ([0.1-0.2[mg/kg/d) and high (>0.2mg/kg/d). A decrease >30% of the initial eGFR was considered as a signifi cant degradation of renal function. A cox model with time-dependent variables was used to identify signifi cant factors associated with renal survival and dysfunction. Linear mixed model was used to study the growth evolution with time. Results: 535 children had a functional graft at 1 year. Only eGFR (>50ml/min) at 1 year (HR=3.7, p<0.05) and intermediate MCSD (HR= 2.6, p=0 .005) were signifi cantly associated with a better graft survival. A low MCSD was associated with a higher risk of renal function degradation. Growth was signifi cantly improved with a low MCSD and eGFR >50ml/min. Interestingly, growth was improved during the fi rst 3 years after renal transplantation for recipients younger than 6 years or older than 12 years, regardless of the MCSD. After this period, growth was improved only for low MCSD.",

We report our experience with sensitized children. Pretransplant patients in waiting list for cadaveric transplantation received desensitization with IVIG and living donors received PP until negative crossmatch was achieved. After transplantation they received prophylactic PP and donor specifi c alloantibody (DSA) monitoring. Methods: Between May 1992 and February 2010, 126 patients underwent kidney transplantation. 9 had PRA> 40%. Median age 12.4 years, 3 females. 8 received graft from diceased donor and one from living donor; median cold ischemic time was16 hrs. Patients missmatch (MM) varied from 1 through 4MM. Patients pretransplant PRA ranges from 0-85%. Results: 2/9 had desensitization with IGEV; 5/9 treated with prophylactic PP after transplantation. All had induction therapy with antithymocite globulin and maintained on prednisone, MMF or azatioprine, and tacrolimus. In 3 an acute humoral rejection (AHR) was diagnosed. Two with graft dysfunction, 3 had DSA and 2 biopsyes showed positive C4D. They were treated with IVIG, PP and AntiCD20 ab. Patients have a mean follow up of 18 months. 100% of graft survival and mean creatinine of 0.94 mg/dl. Conclusions: New protocols with IVIG, PP and antiCD-20 antibodies have become sucessfull in lower anti HLA antibodies allowing renal transplantation. The same therapies can be used after transplantation for AHR. HLA sensitized patients should be monitored for increase risk of antibody mediated rejection.",

High doses of acyclovir and immediate reduction of immunosuppression, may improve the prognosis of severe forms, but multiorgan failure and death may occur despite early antiviral treatment. Methods: Here, we report four cases of VZV infection in children receiving steroid therapy and immunosuppressive drugs for renal allograft, idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, and systemic lupus. Results: The only clinical manifestation in three patients was general malaise, fever, and disseminated vesicular rash, whereas one patient also showed severe and diffuse visceral involvement with multiorgan failure.

Objectives: Renal transplant is the treatment of choice in ESRD patients. Unfortunately complications are common due to previous metabolic disorders and side effects of immunosuppressive therapies.A great portion of these complications can be prevented if diagnosed at early stages.In the present study we try to evaluate the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in kidney recipients. Methods: This study was conducted on 20 ESRD children receiving successful renal transplant.Serum Calcium, Phosphor,Alkaline phosphates,and Parathyroid hormone were assessed before and after transplantation,one and six months later. Results: Calcium levels were not signifi cantly different but PTH, Phosphor,Creatinine and ALP levels were signifi cantly different before and one month after transplantion :(p=0.005),(p=0.000),(p=0.000)and(p=0.001) respectively. Sera levels of Calcium, PTH, Phosphor,Creatinine and ALP were also signifi cantly different between the fi rst and sixth mo nth after operation with P values as followed: (p=0.014),(p=0.005), (p=0.000)and (p=0.005). Conclusions: These results showed screening sera of calcium, phosphor, PTH and ALP is helpful in hyperparathyroidism diagnosis. Data analysis showed the longerthe history of dialysis before transplant the higher prevalence of persistent hyperparathyroidism (p=0.0265). Renal transplant should be considered as soon as possible in ESRD patients to reduce the risk of persistent hyperthyroidism. Objectives: Decreased bone density is one of the most common complications in renal failure cases who underwent renal transplantation.Early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and osteopenia may prevent these complication. Methods: Bone densitometry was done by DEXA method for 20 ESRD children and who had underwent renal transplantation. Bone densitometry was performed before, 6 and 12 month after renal transplantation. Z-score in children were used to compare the changes in bone density early after transplantation.",

Conclusions: According to the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia during the fi rst six months after renal transplantation we suggest prophylactic and curative interventions before and early transplantation. Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of early (<3months) and late (>3 months) episodes of corticosteroid resistant rejection (CRR) treated with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in pediatric renal allograft recipients. Methods: Single centre retrospective study of 15 children (10 male), mean age 13.2 years (SD 5.16 y) who received 7-14 days of ATG for treatment of biopsy proven graft rejection which was unresponsive to methylprednisolone from 1994 to 2009. Results: Seven children received ATG for ER (median 26 days post transplantation, range 6-86 days) and 8 for LR (median 763, days, range 390-4223). All the children who developed ER were on a ciclosporin based immunosuppression (IS) at the time of the rejection episode. Following ATG, there was a signifi cant improvement in the 3 month (76umol/l, SD 21, p 0.03) and 6 month serum creatinine (74umol/l, SD 19, p 0.03) when compared with the value prior to ATG treatment (295umol/l, SD 224) in the ER group. In the LR group there was no signifi cant improvement in the creatinine at 3 (147umol/l, SD 45, p 0.17) or 6 months (158umol/l, SD 74, p 0.64) when compared to value prior to ATG (164umol/l, SD 59). At the latest review, the eGFR in the ER group was 72.3 ml/min/1.73m 2 (SD 33) (mean follow up 10.4 y, range 3-15y) compared to 37.7ml/min/1.73m 2 (SD 17.9) in the LR group (mean follow up of 1.2y, range 0.52-3.2y). During ATG therapy, three children developed septic shock like illness. There was one graft loss in the LR group. Conclusions: ATG therapy in CRR is associated with reversal of rejection and excellent graft outcome in children with ER while the benefi ts remain uncertain in those with LR. Objectives: The aim of this report was to show the development of Bartter-like syndrome in a renal transplanted boy treated with tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone. Methods: CFC, male, 10 years old, previously diagnosed as endoextracapilar glomerulonephritis, was submitted to renal transplant in December 2009 from a deceased donor. Few days after transplant, serum creatinine normalized. Imunossupression included tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone. At the second month after transplant, the patient presented vomits and dehydration accompanied by hypocalemia (1.3 mEq/L), hiponatremia (125 mEq/L), hypochloremia (84 mmol/L) and hypophosphatemia (1.8 mg/dL). He was hospitalized to investigate the etiology of these disturbances. Results: During hospitalization, the patient evolved with polyuria, polydipsia and hydroelectrolyte disorders that needed chronic replacement therapy with potassium salts (8mEq/Kg/day) and sodium chloride (3g/day). Laboratorial evaluation revealed elevation of urinary potassium excretion (excreted fraction, EF=36-86%), hyperphosphaturia (EF=23-36%), hypercalciuria (10-12mg/Kg/ day), metabolic alcalosis, hyperfi ltration (500ml/min/1.73m 2 ) and proteinuria (1.5g/day). Due to tubular function alterations, tacrolimus dose was reduced, determining a better metabolic profi le. However, the patient developed graft rejection (Banff IIb) that needed pulsotherapy and elevation of tacrolimus dose. Despite the recovery of renal function, metabolic disorders worsened. Conclusions: This is the fi rst report of Bartter-like syndrome due to tacrolimus.",

Results: Forty fi ve children (78%) male, aged 15-71 (median 37) months received a renal transplant with a median weight and height of 15 (9-25) kg and 87 (74.5-112) cm respectively. 53% had a kidney from a deceased donor. 92% were adult donors. 91% of the transplants were intra-peritoneal with 100% primary wound closure rate. Median hospital stay was 14.5 (7-60) days. 56% were admitted to PICU for a median duration of 24 (3-504) hours, for ventilation. 28% had a post-operative complication and 38% had an episode of acute rejection. Primary function was seen in 91% of the children, 7% had delayed graft function and 2% had primary non-function.

The natural history of anti CFH has not been well described as most reported cases had been pre-exposed to plasma. Methods: We report a girl presenting aged 9 in established renal failure with aHUS. She was not treated with plasma as biopsy showed end stage histology. No mutations were identifi ed in complement regulator genes. Stored serum samples from 4 years after presentation were assayed for anti CFH. Results: Anti CFH were elevated 4 years after presentation and declined to borderline at 6 years. Living related transplant was successful aged 18 after pre-transplant plasma exchange and.rituximab. Immunosuppression regime was basiliximab induction then tacrolimus, steroids and azathioprine. Post transplant plasma exchange was discontinued after 3 cycles as anti CFH became undetectable and remains so at follow up 10 months later. Conclusions: Anti CFH can naturally decline but may take many years. In this patient without other identifi ed complement regulator gene mutations, successful transplantation was possible. Results: In center A, 24 kidney biopsies were performed during the six months after transplantation. 16 protocol biopsies were performed at three months post Tx, 12 were normal and the other four showed 2 borderline rejection and 2 Banff II. 8 biopsies were motivated by increase of serum creatinine, four were normal and four reveled signs of acute rejection (2 borderline and 2 Banff II). 12 protocol biopsies were performed after 12 months; all were normal. In center B, 12 protocol transplant biopsies were performed at three months post Tx. None showed signs of rejection. All patients underwent a new protocol biopsy at 12 months post Tx and one borderline rejection was detected. No biopsy was performed for increase of serum creatinine in center B.

According to ICMH, studies carried out on nursing mothers have revealed that when they were given extra amounts of body building foods, they produced a large amount of breast milk for their infants. At the same time their health also showed improvement. Inspiring from it, on the same line, a study was undertaken to record the nutritional plants intervention from Sundarbans given to lactating mother immediately after delivery for 42 days and why? Puerperium period is considered to be of 42 days. This paper is presented from a project which is on going to prepare a database on the diet of lactating mothers, nutritional intervention, and special care given to her among different communities of Barguna district, Bangladesh during puerperium. Methods: All the ladies who experienced at least one pregnancy were amongst the sample, or the elderly ladies of the family. The interview schedule was prepared, tested on a small sample, and then data collection was done. All plants were identifi ed and vouchers were stored at the Bangladesh National Herbarium. Objectives: Visceral adiposity has emerged as a better predictor of cardiovascular risk in obese patients. Accurate evaluation of childhood obesity must delineate visceral from subcutaneous adiposity in order to identify patients at high risk for future metabolic consequences. Waist circumference (WC) is a more accurate measure of truncal obesity than body mass index (BMI), but WC is a combined measure of subcutaneous and visceral fat masses. Abdominal volumetric estimate (AVE) may be a novel anthropometric marker of visceral adiposity. Methods: Given the cylindrical morphology of the abdominal cavity, abdominal volume (cm 3 )= (height)(length)(width)= (2)(abdominal length)(WC). Abdominal length will be measured as the distance from xiphoid process to pubic symphysis and WC will be measured at the superior aspect of the iliac crest. The AVE will be corrected for musculoskeletal mass and will be correlated with MRI-derived visceral fat measurements. Results: MRI-derived visceral fat measurements will be correlated with anthropometric indices (BMI, WC, waist-height ratio, skin fold thickness) and with each corrected AVE formula. The best predictive model will be selected using multiple regression analysis.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of overnutrition during neonatal periods on the development of renal pathophysiological changes. Methods: Rat pups were adjusted to either 3 or 10 pups per mother (overnurition and control, respectively) from day 1 to days 21 of life. We measured the effects of early postnatal nutrition excess on potential renal changes related to obesity by 28 days. Results: Smaller litter male pups weighed heavier than controls on days 4 and between days 10 and 28 after birth (P < 0.05). By 28 days of age, overnutrition had no signifi cant effects on renal cell proliferation, apoptosis, numbers of macrophages and glomerulosclerosis. In immunoblots and immnnohistochemistry, renin and angiotensin II type (AT) 2 receptor protein expressions signifi cantly increased in overnutrition rats (P < 0.05). In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 protein expressions decreased in the overnutrition group (P < 0.05). AT 1 receptor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tissue inhibitor of MMP-1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, osteopontin and adiponectin expressions were not different between the two groups. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that postnatal overfeeding leads to unexpected and deleterious renal alterations. Increased renin and AT2 may decrease renal PAI-1 and MMP-9, suggesting an inhibitory effect on accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins or the impairment of matrix turnover in neonatally overfed male rats.",

Conclusions: we concluded that patients with ESKD has a low level of L-arginine specially in those with malnutrition and that leads to increase in platelet aggregation and this may increase the possibility of thrombus formation, and we suggest the use of nutritional supplementation of L-arginine to suppress this process of atherothrombosis.

Objectives: To evaluate the impact of potassium citrate and/or thiazides on bone mass density (BMD) and growth parameters of children and adolescents with primary hypercalciuria (PH). Methods: Historical cohort of 84 patients with PH. Median follow-up of 12years. All patients were submitted to bone mass densitometry with DEXA-Lunar DPX-IQ. Lumbar-spine BMD (L1-L4), Z-score before (BMD1 and ZS1) and after (BMD2 and ZS2) treatment with potassium citrate and/or thiazides (at least 24m) were performed. Patients were classifi ed in 2 groups: G1 those who followed the prescription and G2 who did not. Height, body weight and respective percentiles according to NCHS were obtained. Height percentiles were categorized (<P5 as 1, P5 as 2, P5-P10 as 3 and so on) and compared before and after treatment. Tests: T-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Forty-six (56%) boys and 38 (45%) girls were regularly followed for 154\u00b140 months. Mean initial height percentile score (MIHPS) was 7.2\u00b12.7 (P25-P50) compared to 7.8\u00b12.6 (P25-P50)p<0.0001. Mean interval between BMD was 27.14\u00b117m. Sixty-four (76%) patients were classifi ed as G1. MIHPS in G1 increased from 7.21\u00b12.7(P25-50) to 8.12\u00b12.69 (P50-75) (p<0.001). No difference was observed in G2. BMD changes signifi cantly from 0.745\u00b10.175 to 0.858\u00b10.184g/cm\u00b3(p<0.001).",

Renal biopsy in four affected individuals showed foci of interstitial infi ltrates and focal global glomerulosclerosis. GWLA and fi ne mapping yielded a multipoint parametric LOD score of 2.9 on chromosome 16p. Positional cloning of the genes within the locus yielded a novel in-frame insertion deletion mutation 278_289delins TCTGCCCCGAAG>CCGCCTCCT in exon 3 of uromodulin. The in-frame change leads to loss of a highly conserved cysteine residue in position 94. The mutation segregates in affected individuals in the family. Conclusions: Phenotype previously associated with uromodulin defects include chronic interstitial nephritis, JFHS and glomerulocystic disease. This fi nding in combination with the recent GWAS reveal that uromodulin is a common disease locus in subjects with CKD and suggests that defective uromodulin may have wider deleterious effects in the kidney. In conclusion, a novel insertion-deletion mutation in uromodulin in a large family with CKD and proteinuria expands the clinical spectrum of disease associated with defective uromodulin. Objectives: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited kidney disorder. ADPKD is caused by mutations either in PKD1 or PKD2 genes. Recent studies have shown that some mutations classifi ed as missense and synonymous can induce pre-mRNA splicing defects. Our goal is to determine the functional consequences of this kind of PKD1 and PKD2 mutations in pre-RNA splicing. Methods: PKD1 and PKD2 minigenes were constructed with exons 2-3, 11, 23, 24-25-26 or 37-38-39, and with exons 4, 5 or 13, respectively. Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Minigenes were transfected into HEK293T cells and mRNA was analysed by RT-PCR. Results: Five missense and two synonymous PKD1 mutations and six PKD2 missense mutations were analysed. G109G creates a donor splice site, leading to an aberrant mRNA lacking the 3' end of exon 3. R3753R activates a cryptic donor splice site and generates an altered mRNA missing the 3\u00b4 end of exon 39. Analysis of PKD2 missense mutations R306Q, R322W, R325Q and A356P showed increased incorporation of exon 4 in the mRNA. The rest of mutations showed no effect in pre-mRNA splicing. Conclusions: PKD1 synonymous variants G109G and R3753R act as splicing mutations. These represent the fi rst PKD1 synonymous mutations that affect pre-mRNA splicing. PKD2 missense mutations seem to alter the regulation of the mRNA splicing process. Our results emphasize the importance of performing mRNA analysis when evaluating the effect of exonic mutations. Objectives: Primary vesicoureteral refl ux (pVUR) is a major cause of pediatric ESRD. We localized a gene for pVUR on chr. 12p11-q13 under a recessive model. Evidence for linkage was strongest among the Hasidic Jewish, which has a founder effect. To narrow down the linkage interval we performed a case control association study in our Hasidic Jewish cohort. Methods: Cases were ascertained with a positive VCUG. Controls were of the same ethnicity and did not have a family history of any urologic/kidney disease. We genotyped 18 familial Jewish cases and 437 controls with the Illumina 660W arrays. 3,489 SNPs in the LOD-1 interval (29.5 Mb) were used for the association study. Standard QC fi lters were performed. Results: Our analysis with PLINK revealed a genomic infl ation factor \u03bb =1.03, indicating almost no population stratifi cation. Within the LOD-1 interval on chr. 12 we found 9 suggestive SNPs (p-value<10 -4 ). The most promising signal was an intronic SNP in a gene highly expressed in the metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric bud of the developing kidney (p-value=2.62x10 -5 , OR= 3.9). This association is signifi cant after Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: pVUR is a complex disorder with a recessive gene on chr. 12p11-q13. Initial association results in familial Jewish cases and controls indicate several potential candidate genes for pVUR in this interval. We are now performing a replication study in Jewish and non-Jewish cohorts to identify the gene underlying our locus. Objectives: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious illness that causes severe and irreversible reduction in kidney function. One consequence of CKD is an elevated cancer risk. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. There is no genomic data which has been demonstrated by some cytogenetic markers in children with CKD. Methods: In this study, DNA/oxidative damage in lymphocytes from 17 children in pre-dialysis stage (PreD), 15 children on regular hemodialysis (HD), and 17 renal transplanted (TX) children has been compared to 20 healthy children by the strand breaks and endonuclease III (Endo III), formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG) sensitive sites in Comet Assay.

Methods: Review of clinical features and analysis of AVPR2 and AQP2 genes of four patients with NDI and molecularly proven diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis, Bartter syndrome, nephronophthisis and apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME), respectively. Results: All patients excreted hypotonic urine during hypernatremic dehydration and had no further increase in urine osmolality after DDAVP, consistent with NDI, yet no mutation in AVPR2 and AQP2 genes could be identifi ed. In two patients the diagnosis of NDI was missed, leading to repeated hypernatremia. In the other 2 patients, NDI was mistakenly assumed to be the primary diagnosis, delaying identifi cation of the underlying disorder. In one patient, NDI was reversible with treatment of her AME.",

Results: Forty nine children (58.3 %) were initial steroid responder and thirty fi ve (41.7 %) were steroid resistant.

Methods: Three siblings (2 girls 3 yrs and 2 yrs, and a boy 4 mo) presented with severe polyuria and polydipsia. DDAVP challenge test confi rmed the diagnosis of NDI. Their mother was asymptomatic and all had different fathers (also asymptomatic) thus making the diagnosis of autosomal recessive or dominant form of NDI due to aquaporin 2 (AQP2) gene mutations unlikely. Results: Genetic testing was initially performed on the eldest sibling. There were no mutations in the AQP2 gene. However, she was heterozygous positive for a complex allele in the AVPR2 gene with three mutations (R64Q, A147V, and A163P). Of these mutations, A163P has been associated with X-NDI. Genetic testing of mother and other two siblings revealed the presence of identical mutations. The only other male family members (maternal grandfather and maternal cousin) were asymptomatic and genetic testing in both of them was negative for mutations in the AVPR2 gene.

The reason for decrease in severity in the two sisters is thus unclear. Objectives: Neurotrophins (NTs) and their receptors (NTRs) are known to be important for pathogenesis of various infl ammatory diseases that occur in not only neuronal but also non-neuronal tissues, including kidney. Thus, we performed genetic association study between childhood IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and NTs and NTRs. Methods: We genotyped and analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding NTs (nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) and NTRs (nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1-3 (NTRK1-3)) in 197 IgAN patients and 289 healthy controls. Results: The genotyping data of IgAN patients and healthy control subjects revealed signifi cant association between NGF SNP rs11102930 and presence of IgAN.

Objectives: This study evaluates the neuroimaging findings of a subset of ADPKD children presenting with headaches and/or family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in fi rst-degree relatives. Methods: We follow 63 children (age 1 -20 years; 25% < 1 year) with ADPKD. Twenty (31.7%), age 3-20 years, who presented with headaches or a family history of SAH had central nervous system (CNS) investigation. Results: Twenty ADPKD children who were imaged with CAT (n = 3) or MRI angiography (n = 17) had no cerebral vascular aneurysms. Five (25%) children (age 16-18 years) showed CNS abnormalities including areas of white matter demyelination (n = 2); cerebral/cerebellar atrophy and partial atrophy of posterior corpus callosum (n = 1); a 3 mm periventricular cyst (n = 1); and CNS lesions typical of known spina bifi da with VP shunt placement (n=1). Conclusions: This database documents neuroimaging anomalies before adulthood in 4 children (exclusive of expected fi ndings of VP shunted child), 2 of which had demyelinative changes, compared to an incidence of approximately 3% in non-ADPKD children with headaches. These fi ndings are likely developmental and are not located in a vascular pattern. There is a need for longer studies and an understanding of the relevance of these to the patients' complaints. ADPKD during early development has abnormal cilary function and primary cilia are critical to neural stem cell development as demonstrated by mice with Kif3A or Smo protein anomalies, which demonstrate failure of radial astrocytes responsible for adult neurogenesis. CNS neuroimaging fi ndings may predict a cohort of ADPKD children at higher risk of developing cerebral aneurysms.",

Objectives: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a complement dysregulation disorder with a major impact of genetic background. C3 gene mutations have been proposed as a novel susceptibility factor. We screened a large population of children with aHUS from Europe for mutations in the C3 gene. Methods: An unselected cohort of 67 children with aHUS was examined for C3 gene mutations. To investigate the pathogenic relevance of the identifi ed mutations, complement deposition on endothelial cell (EC) surfaces after incubation with sera of patient and their parents was studied. Results: Sequencing revealed 3 novel heterozygous mutations (4%) in 3 unrelated patients and one uncommon C3 polymorphism. The mutations were not found in 100 healthy donors. One mutation is located within the Factor H (SCR3) binding site of C3b. EC exposed to serum containing this mutant deposited increased amounts of C3 compared to normal, at a level similar to Factor H depleted serum. The second mutation did not caused increased C3 deposition in any of the tested conditions. The third one is located in proximity to the Factor B binding site. Carriers of this mutation present with low C3 levels, precluding the use of their sera in EC assays. Conclusions: We identifi ed 3 novel mutations in the C3 gene in our aHUS cohort. One mutation leads to markedly increased C3 deposition on EC surfaces. Another mutation possibly results in a hyperfunctional C3 convertase, leading to C3 consumption. Functional tests with recombinant C3 are in progress.",

We concluded both mutations are playing a crucial role in the etiology of CNS. Objectives: Studies on murine models demonstrated that Sprouty1 protein, encoded by Spry1 gene, modulates Gdnf/Ret signal, which activates a crucial gene network in urinary tract development. Spry1-knockout mice develop supernumerary ureteric buds, which result in multiple ureters and kidneys. In the literature, there is only one report about mutational analysis of human SPRY1 gene, the homologue of murine Spry1, even if the gene is known to be expressed in human fetal renal tissue. Methods: We carried out mutational analysis of SPRY1 gene in patients with duplex ureter: 23 isolated and 4 familial cases. On each DNA sample, the coding region and 5'UTR were analysed by SSCP and all PCR products were directly sequenced (ABI PRISM 3100 Applied Biosystem). DNA from 6 subjects without kidney and urinary tract anomalies was used as control. Results: We detected 5 polymorphisms (SNPs), previously reported in databases, and 1 nucleotide substitution, which has never been reported.

Kidney biopsy showed FSGS. 6 years later low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis grade II were found. Second patient is a 12 years old boy referred for nocturnal enuresis at the age of 6 years. Low-molecular-weight proteinuria and hypercalciuria with normal renal function were found. US showed nephrocalcinosis grade II. Kidney biopsy showed total sclerosis of 9% of investigated glomeruli and calcifi cations in interstitium and medular tubule. Results: DNA analysis of CLCN5 gene in fi rst patient revealed the 637delT mutation in exon 4 leading to a frame-shift mutation introducing a premature stop codon in position 137 of the protein chain (C116VfsX137). CLCN5 gene analysis in second patient showed a complex allele (IVS2-17T>G; H731P) constituted of nucleotide substitution in intron 2 and exon 12 leading to a missense mutation changing histidin with prolin in protein chain.

A heterozygous mutation (K323E) was found in FB, located on chr. 6, in the family members with low C3 values, including the aHUS patients. This change has been identifi ed as a gain of function mutation resulting in a C3bBb complex that is more resistant to decay by DAF and CFH. No genetic changes were found in the other screened genes and no \u03b1FH were identifi ed. Conclusions: A pathogenic mutation (K323E) was found in FB in three aHUS patients and three family members.

Objectives: Children with nephrotic syndrome the relapses are frequently triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infections, possibly mediated by cytokine release. Montelukast sodium has been successfully used to reduce the exacerbations of bronchial asthma due to viral infections in children. The hypothesis that montelukast sodium would reduce the incidence of viral infections thereby reduce the risk of relapse was tested by this study. Methods: Sequential patients receiving low dose (<0.6mg/kg) prednisolone on alternate day with or without adjuvant therapy as maintenance were recruited. Montelukast sodium was prescribed for a period of one year at a dose of 4mg for children below 5 years and 8mg for above 5 years. The number of relapse episodes was compared for the twelve months before and after commencing on montelukast therapy. A freshly voided urine sample was tested each morning and the presence of 3 + proteinuria 3+ proteinuria for three consecutive days was diagnostic of relapse. Results: 118 patients were recruited and 112 completed the study. 79 male ; 33 female. Age at entry ranged from 2.5 to 13.2 (median 6.2) years.

Objectives: Autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is an inherited progressive disease leading to ESRD. Almost all patients develop liver fi brosis that may require liver-kidney-transplantation. Early detection and quantifi cation of fi brosis can provide useful information for management of patients with ARPKD. Methods: We report the use of a new sonography based method (transient elastography, Fibroscan\u00ae) for early and noninvasive detection of liver fi brosis in patients suffering from ARPKD. This method is already well established in adult patients with hepatic disease, measuring ultrasound wave spreading as an indicator for tissue stiffness. Results: ARPKD patients (n=7, mean age 9.5 years) showed a signifi cantly increased liver stiffness compared to matched healthy controls (11.2 vs. 4.1 kPa; p=0.018). All patients had results above the upper reference value (7.5 kPa), while healthy controls and three patients with renal cysts of other reasons and no liver fi brosis were within normal reference values. Conventional sonography in ARPKD patients gave evidence for hepatic fi brosis in 4 patients, while 3 had still normal liver ultrasound.",

Methods: 111 children (age 2-17 yr) with GFR between 60-90 ml/min/1.73m 2 were studied. Serum cystatin C (CysC) and creatinine (Cr) were determined by immunonephelometry using DAKO PET kit and kinetic Jaffe method respectively. Creatinine derived GFR was estimated using 2 equations: (1) Schwartz (0.55 x height/Cr), (2) our creatinine formula (0.43 x height/Cr). GFR was derived from cystatin using 3 equations: (1) Larsson (99.43 x CysC -1.5837 ), Objectives: Effacement of podocyte foot processes occurs in many proteinuric nephropathies and is accompanied with rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study the intracellular pathways of EGF in podocytes, which induced abnormality of cytoskeletal architecture and dysfunction of podocytes, was investigated. Methods: EGF expression was detected both in nephrotic rat model and podocyte injury induced by puromycin. F-actin distribution, nephrin expression, and RhoA activation as well, were detected in mouse podocytes after EGF treatment. Results: Both in nephrotic rat model and podocyte injury induced by puromycin, an increased EGF expression was revealed. In addition, redistribution of F-actin fi bers and down-regulation of nephrin expression in mouse podocytes were also detected with the treatment of EGF. Meanwhile the increased RhoA activity was revealed in podocytes exposed to EGF. The rearrangement of F-actin as well as the decreased nephrin expression could be rescued by the addition of Y27632, a reagent to inhibit Rho kinase-dependent stress fi ber formation.",

Methods: 107 obese children and adolescents and 50 controls were evaluated. Blood and urinary samples were collected to evaluate markers of renal function, serum and urinary NO and urinary isoprostanes. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed in all. Obesity and insulin resistance (IR) degree were expressed by SDS-BMI and HOMA-IR. Results: CysC and e-GFR did not signifi cant differ between the 2 groups. AER was increased in obese children. CysC and GFR were related to HOMA-IR, AER was related to SDS-BMI and HOMA-IR. Signifi cantly reduced NO levels and increased urinary isoprostanes and BP measurement were observed in obese children. All were signifi cantly related to adiposity and IR indexes. Conclusions: Difference seen in AER supported a role of obesity and IR in the genesis of glomerular leaking of albumin; we also observed differences in NO and urinary isoprostanes, but they were probably related to adiposity and IR rather than represent a clear risk factor for renal disease. Renal involvement is not an early manifestation of obesity in childhood, since no relevant differences can be detected when comparing renal function indexes of obese and non-obese children. A longer exposure to obesity and IR is probably needed.

Patient satisfaction was not signifi cantly associated with subjective ratings of disease severity or friendliness of nurses or doctors, but showed a signifi cant correlation with trust in doctors (p<0.0001). There was no apparent correlation of patient satisfaction with compliance. Conclusions: Measurement of patient satisfaction by the ZUF-8 score is a promising tool for evaluating quality of care in pediatric populations. Objectives: Background: Age related functional decline has been associated with macro-autophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy. This association has been characterized in many organs. Since the kidney suffers a functional deterioration with age and the molecular mechanisms responsible are not fully identifi ed, we have studied the expression of autophagy related molecules in kidneys of aging mice. Methods: Methods: Immunoblot of mouse renal tissue from three different age groups (young, middle aged and old) was performed for essential proteins of the two major autophagic pathways in mammalian cells: macro-autophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy. Functional studies were carried out using lysosomes isolated from kidneys of the same mice groups. Results: Results: 1) Levels of both effector and regulator proteins of macroautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy increase considerably with age in mice.",

Objectives: The study attempts to determine the effect that the condition has on enuretic children and their parents as well as their opinion of it. Methods: 104 enuretic children (7 -14 years) and their parents were surveyed on the effects of enuresis on their lives. Both groups were asked the following questions: Do you consider enuresis a normal condition? Do you consider enuresis to be a disease? Do you feel indifferent, angry, or embarrassed about enuresis?

Conclusions: Renal failure and not fanconi syndrome seems to be an indicating factor for thyroid deterioration. A renal transplant does not protect. Indeed, early starting with an adequate dose of cysteamine prevents or delays thyroid failure. Objectives: The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) may be helpful in establishing the cause of acute renal failure. This study was performed to determine the infl uence of the glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR), sodium intake and tubular function on FeNa in children without renal failure. Methods: Reliable 24h-urine collections from patients (4-18years of age, GFR >60 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) were used to determine sodium excretion, GFR and FeNa. The infl uence of tubular function was studied in 5 patients with generalized tubular dysfunction. Results: Based on data from 761 patients, a multiple regression formula was designed based on GFR and sodium excretion that predicted over 80% of the variation in FeNa (R square=0.824, p<0.001). Using this formula, the predicted FeNa was signifi cantly lower than the measured FeNa in the children with tubular dysfunction. Conclusions: FeNa depends on GFR, sodium intake, and tubular function, and interpretation is impossible without knowledge on all factors.",

Swallowing studies, electromyography, abdominal ultrasonograpy, respiratory function test and ophthalmic examination were performed. Results: Mean age of diagnosis was 36.7 months (range 1month-14 years). Most of the patients were suffering from polyuria, polydipsia and growth retardation at the time of diagnosis. At mean age 10.6 year, 40% of patients progressed to renal failure. Five patients (20%) had renal transplantation. 84% of patients had cystine crystals in cornea and 42% had photophobia at time of diagnosis. One patient had elevated creatin kinase levels and electromyography revealed myopathy. 31% of patients were found to have gastroesophageal refl ux, and 21 % of them had remnants in esophagus while swallowing. Two out of 4 patients had restrictive pattern of respiratory functions. While 72% of patients had hepatomegaly, 38% of them had fi ne granular echo pattern and two had minimal heterogeneity of liver at ultrasonography, 55% also had increased minimum and maximum velocities of blood fl ow in portal vein. Conclusions: Renal complications are early manifestations of cystinosis, some of patients need renal replacement at fi rst decade even under cysteamine therapy, but many could survive until adulthood without great loss of renal functions. Thus extra renal complications are more common in adults, cystinotic children also have the risk of developing many extrarenal complications and deserve close follow-up and management.",

These domains can be rather disparate and require KB across professional boundaries. We examined patterns of KB amongst the MPT to identify the barriers and facilitators to brokering clinical and psychosocial knowledge. Methods: A mixed methods research design was undertaken over 3 yrs with 2 rounds of social network analysis and interviews with all involved complimented by quarterly observations at team meetings and ward rounds. Results: KB is facilitated through development of social capital (SC). Organisational structures and human resources practices link knowledge domains and members laterally; i.e. structural dimension to SC. Co-location of team members and frequent interaction builds high trust relationships and are a prerequisite for effective KB at a healthcare system level; i.e. relational dimension of SC. Effective knowledge brokers in healthcare possess expertise related to the knowledge domains between which they are brokering; i.e. cognitive dimension to SC. Conclusions: Clinical managers can help build necessary social capital for effective knowledge exchange through the ways in which staff are socialised into a new way of working that integrates clinical and psychosocial knowledge for patient benefi t; eg ensuring the provision of psychosocial as well as clinical expertise; recruiting staff already exposed to the new way of working (eg underwent their training in the department); ensuring that situated learning across clinical and psychosocial domains ensues in meetings or ward rounds.",

It was shown that Filler and and the classical Schwartz equation overestimated GFR by a mean of 21 and 15.5 ml/min/1.73m 2 , respectively, in comparison to the iohexol method, and the S2 and the S3 formula underestimated GFR by 15.1 and 17.6 ml/min/1.73m 2 , respectively. GFR according to DUC had the lowest precision and an unpredictable error. The same tendency was noted in children with BSA < 1m 2 and BSA> 1 m 2 . Conclusions: Estimating GFR by means of a single formula might be imprecise, especially at high GFR. The three markers Schwartz formula yields the lowest error in comparison with the reference iohexol method. Objectives: It is known that excessive intake of sodium leading to hypernatriuria (> 3 mEq/kg/day) is associated with hypercalciuria (> 4 mg/kg/day) and/or hyperuricosuria (10 -15 mg/kg/day). The objective was to evaluate this association in children and adolescents referred to an university clinic because of hematuria. Methods: Observational and retrospective study of medical records of 177 children and adolescents presenting complaint and/or laboratory evidence of macro (76,3%) or microscopic (23,7%) hematuria, treated at the Pediatric Nefrology Clinic from May 1999 to January 2009. Of the patients studied, 117 (66.1%) were male and the mean age at initial consultation was 8.0 years (9 months to 15 years). Thrity patients were excluded from the analysis for having hematuria of glomerular origin, and 31 who did not complete the metabolic investigation. The investigation was carried out from the interview data and laboratory tests. Results: Of 109 patients studied, the etiology was not detected in 19 (17%); 27 had nephrolithiasis and 63 had metabolic disorders. Of the patients with nephrolithiasis, in 7 was the cause not found and among the remaining 20 with metabolic disorders, 17 (85%) had hypernatriurua and in 6 of them (30%) it was the only fi nding. Among patients with metabolic disorders, 39 (62%) had hypernatriuria, which was isolated in 8 (13%). Conclusions: Among the causes of non-glomerular hematuria in childhood there was a predominance of metabolic disorders in agreement with the description in literature, and the presence of hypernatriuria, probably due to high sodium ingest, was quite high. Therefore the prescription of low sodium diet for these patients should always be recommended.",

Most children evaluated the approach as very important for the prevention of diseases that affect the kidney (98%), and the initiative of the researchers (94%). Conclusions: Health education and prevention for kidney disease in children is feasible and have great epidemiological signifi cance. The children are overweight, with a high sodium intake, low fl uid intake, and most are unaware of behaviors that harm kidney function. There is a defi ciency in advising children in establishing rules and habits, as well as warning about the importance the family history has for risk factors. Objectives: Radionuclide has offered an alternative method of estimating GFR that avoids some of the practical disadvantages of inulin clearance. But radioisotopic method has the disadvantage of precautions being required in handling and disposal of radioactive materials. To avoid the practical diffi culties of formal measurement of clearance, several prediction formulas have been published. The most commonly used in children is the Schwartz formula. The aim of this study is to identify an adequate measurement of GFR in pediatric clinical practice. Methods: 99m Tc-DTPA clearance (mGFR) was measured as GFR marker in 170 patients with different chronic kidney diseases. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated via Schwartz formula. The agreement between eGFRs and mGFRs was evaluated by Kappa statistics. The precision was evaluated by R 2 from linear regression and the accuracy was measured by the percentage of GFR estimates within 30% of the mGFR (P 30 ).",

Methods: The children were selected by stratifi ed, cluster and random sampling. If the fi rst urinalysis was abnormal, a second screening would be performed to confi rm the result. The guardians of the children were asked to fi ll out the uniform questionnaire. Results: Approximate 12,105 children (from 4 urban districts and 4 rural districts) have been studied. The analysis of the questionnaire showed that 27.1% of the guardians knew nothing about the impairment caused by kidney diseases (urban, 20.4% vs rural, 33.3%; P<0.05). In the fi rst screening, the prevalence of abnormal urinalysis was 12.2% (urban, 11.1% vs rural, 13.2%; P<0.05). During the second screening, abnormal urinalysis was identifi ed in 10.0% of the subjects (urban, 14.2% vs rural, 7.0%; P<0.05). The overall prevalence of confi rmed Renal Replacement Therapy Objectives: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a risk factor and intermediate endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity. We aimed to assess the prevalence, incidence and predictors of LVH in pediatric PD patients. Methods: LVH was defi ned by the 95 th percentile of the Khoury LVMI percentiles, using height age to account for growth retardation. Results: 507 children followed in 25 countries were analyzed. 39% of the patients had offi ce hypertension. The overall LVH prevalence was 48.1% (30.8 concentric and 17.4% eccentric); 21.3% had concentric remodeling. Longitudinal analysis of 128 pts revealed 33 % incidence of de novo LVH and a 45 % incidence of LVH regression per year on dialysis. Transformation to and reversion from concentric geometry were equally common (37%). By logistic regression analysis, hypertension, obesity, the use of the CAPD, renal disease other than hypodysplasia, and hyperparathyroidism were risk factors for the presence of LVH. The use of RAS antagonists and a high total fl uid output were protective from concentricity. The risk of LVH (persistent/de novo) at one year was increased by systolic BP SDS and reduced in children with renal hypodysplasia. Conclusions: LVH was highly prevalent among pediatric PD patients. Dynamic changes were observed during follow up in favour of LVH regression with better BP control. Hypodysplasia appears to be protective against LVH, likely due to lower BP and polyuria even on dialysis. Obesity, hyperparathyroidism and fl uid overload are additional, potentially modifi able determinants of LVH. The use of APD modalities and RAS antagonists may be associated with better CV outcomes. Objectives: Maintaining RRF is known to reduce the cardiovascular complications and mortality in patients on dialysis. However, only a few studies on RRF have been performed in children. Thus we investigated the risk factors of deterioration of RRF in children on PD. Methods: Fifty-fi ve children (M:F 36:19, median age 13 years) with RRF and on chronic PD were retrospectively studied. RRF deterioration rates in 136 interval periods were measured by dividing \u2206 renal Kt/V, \u2206 renal Ccr and \u2206 urine volume per body surface area (UV/BSA) by the length of the period. Clinical and biochemical parameters of the periods were analyzed to determine the risk factors of losing RRF. Results: Presence of hypertension by the defi nition of NHBPEP correlated with more rapid decline of renal Kt/V (P=0.017), renal Ccr (P=0.010) and UV/ BSA (P=0.007); high systolic BP correlated with all the three indices while high diastolic BP correlated only with UV/BSA. Low hemoglobin level was associated with loss of renal Kt/V (P=0.023) and Ccr (P=0.002), but not with UV/BSA. However, gender, age, underlying disease, baseline RRF, BMI standard deviation score, PD modalities and duration, PD solutions, peritoneal permeability, and echocardiographic indices were not associated with the decline rate of RRF. Conclusions: Hypertension and anemia are associated with more rapid loss of RRF in children on PD. Prospective studies are necessary to prove the causal relationship between these factors and RRF loss. Objectives: To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a nocturnal hemodialysis regimen in children and adolescents. Methods: A hospital-based NHD program was started as a regular treatment option for maintenance HD patients in 2006. Over a period of 48 months, 15 patients (12 to 17 years old) were prospectively enrolled in this program. NHD was performed for 8 hours, 3 nights per week and treatment was supervised at all times by a pediatric nephrologist and dialysis nurses. Central venous lines or fi stulae were used for blood access. Uremia-associated parameters, medication dosage as well as dietary parameters were regularly monitored. The SF36 test was used to evaluate the quality of life. Results were compared to data from agematched patients treated with conventional HD (3x4 hours/week). Results: Compared with controls, NHD patients had a signifi cant decrease in predialytic mean arterial blood pressure, as well as in phosphate levels, calciumphosphate product and parathyroid hormone levels. Objectives: The pathophysiologic mechanism of nephrotic syndrome is not yet known clearly. At least in some cases, certain 'circulating factors' are thought to increase the glomerular protein permeability, which may have systemic effect on peritoneal membrane. We evaluated the loss of protein through peritoneal membrane in patients on peritoneal dialysis due to the end stage renal disease (ESRD) caused by steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS).",

Mean interval between HD onsetand a fi rst bacterial infection was 1.9 months (8 days -2 months) PCT serum levels during bacterial infections were higher (101.5 ng/ml; 1.18-976.4) than those detected during seven non-bacterial (presumably viral) infections with negative blood culture and absence of infectious focus (35; 5.27-510 ng/ml; p<0.0002). Serum PCT and CRP levels were highly correlated (p<0.001).",

            "text": "PCT has a small molecular weight and is eliminated partially by glomerular fi ltration. Conclusions: Reduction of renal PCT clearance in children on HD is probably the reason for increased PCT levels even in presumably viral infections. A smaller stimulation of PCT synthesis during viral infections produces a dramatic increase of PCT serum levels. Therefore, PCT levels have to be interpreted with caution in ESRD children. Results: Mean age of these 11 children commencing Haemodialysis (HD) was 23.9 months (range 5-64months). Mean duration on HD was 23.7months (range 5-50months). Mean weight was 9.8 kg at the start of HD (range 7.5-14.2 kg). 7 patients had renal dysplasia, 2 bilateral wilm's tumor, 1 congenital anapheric, 1 infantile oxalosis. 8 patients were switched from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to HD. Central Venous Catheters (CVL) used were10 Kimal and1Quinton permcath, placed in right internal jugular in all. 6 CVLs were changed, 3 due to breakages, 1 pulled by patient, 2 revised due to malposition. 3 CVLs had confi rmed thrombus and were salvaged with Tinzaparin subcutaneous therapy daily for 4 weeks. One episode of CVL infection due to strep was successfully treated. Poor growth remains a major challenge for this particular cohort, 10 patients are/were on Nasogastric or Peg feeds. 1 had renal osteodystrophy and required osteotomies. 2 patients had hypertension and required oral medications. 7 patients have been transplanted, 1 switched backed to PD after 50 months on HD. Conclusions: Haemodialysis is an erroneous but suitable option for children less than 15 kg. CVL breakages were the main reason for changing lines in our patients. Very low CVL infection in our unit is a result of strict adherence to our CVL access protocol. CVL thrombus can be safely and adequately resolved with Tinzaparin in renal failure children receiving HD.",

Assessing the effects of IMT upon P on HD to favor the expression of inner contents; enhancing non traumatic, pleasant treatment aspects, provoking and activating the unhazardous creative skill by means of the music experiment unpredictability of improvisation and composition as opposed to the predictability of a chronic disease while favoring empowerment toward stress confrontation. Methods: 7 P (3-20 y) undergo IMT 1 h/week in which MT and P interact on music experiences with employed music instruments built by the P according to their abilities with the MT collaboration. The work was designed at fi rst as a group activity, but is also individually performed as well as in pairs depending on the willingness and conditions presented by P. MT creativity and fl exibility are fundamental to understand P as the therapy core and to accept different age brackets lead into diverse musical preferences and choices. During music improvisations P, parents, nurses and MT interact. Results: 4 P have individually composed lyrics and tunes and 2 more did the same collaboratively. The 3y P continuously improvises on the contents of a video referring to the existence of miracles. Through tune and lyrics content analysis the importance of expressing feelings turned toward future, strength, adversity facing, and transplant is observed. Music has favored interaction among staff, parents and P. Conclusions: Duly-adapted, fl exible music therapy can be employed during HD and can be another supporting aid to dialysis children.",

Methods: 52 children who received CRRT over the last 5 yrs were retrospectively analyzed using: sex, age, body weight, primary diagnosis, indication for CRRT, number of failed organs.Severity scores (PRISM III and PELOD) were calculated at admission, on the day CRRT was started and 24h later. Outcome of CRRT and signifi cance of severity scores were analyzed. Results: 52 pts (29 m, 23 f) were treated (17 neonates,10 infants). Mean age was 48 mos (0-216) and weight 17.9 kg (1.7-85).Primary diagnoses were: sepsis-16 children (31%), renal disease-11 (21%), and metabolic disturbances or intoxications-11 (21%), whilst 14 (27%) had other diseases. The most common indicationwas sepsis with MOD, with or without fl uid overload in 13 (25%) and 10 (19%) pts, respectively. Mean number of failed organs was 3.2 (1-7). Mean PRISM III scores at the beginning of CRRT and after 24h of treatment was 8.8 and 7.7, respectively (p<0,01). Mean PELOD score at the beginning of the CRRT was 15.8, with consecutive mean mortality risk of 33.1%. The overall survival was 35/52 (67%). 21/22 pts with < 3 organs failed survived (95%), contrary to 14/30 (46%) pts with 3 and more organs affected. There is signifi cant difference between PRISM III score at the beginning of the CRRT among survivors and non survivors (p<0,01). Objectives: Our study was conducted to evaluate longitudinal changes in dialysate cancer antigen 125 (dCA125) levels over time and to analyze relationship between dCA125 and peritoneal glucose exposure (PGE) in children treated with long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods: Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed in 11 patients (7 boys) with a mean age of 13\u00b15.1 years and a mean PD duration of 84.0\u00b11.1 months. Peritoneal transport parameters were calculated, and dCA125 levels were measured after 4-hour dwells of PETs. Peritoneal appearance rates (AR) of dCA125, the velocity of the decrease in ARCA125 values and annual PGE levels were calculated. Results: Final investigations were performed in 11 children at a mean of 63.3\u00b13.5 (range 59.0-66.8) months after the initial ones. Both dCA125 and ARCA125 levels had shown statistically signifi cant decreaments during the follow up period (p=0.003) and the velocity of decrease in ARCA125 was found to be 52.6\u00b119.4%. No signifi cant difference was found regarding peritoneal transport parameters. PGE values were signifi cantly higher in the last year as compared to the fi rst year (p=0,014).

            "text": "We can speculate that after 5 years of PD treatment, mesothelial cell mass reduction is likely to occur. However, mesothelial cells are not likely to play a direct role in peritoneal transport during PD treatment. Furthermore, PGE may not have any infl uence on peritoneal transport parameters of patients with longer PD duration. Objectives: Hemodialysis (HD) in children and infants with ESRD is performed mainly via central venous catheters (CVC). CVC-related infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this group of patients. We aimed to determine HD-CVC infection rates and survival times in a our Pediatric Dialysis Unit. Methods: We analyzed the data of all children with ESRD who received HD therapy in our Unit between 2001 and 2009. Our strict care of HD-CVC makes no use of prophylactic (topical or systemic) antibiotic therapy. Results: Twenty nine children with ESRD (mean age 8.3 yrs) received HD via a CVC for a total of 22892 days during the study period. Eleven (38%) were infants (<1yr of age) who received HD for cumulative 3779 days (16% of total). Fifty nine CVCs were inserted, of which 13 (22%) were in infants. There were 12 episodes of CVC infections-a ratio of 0.52/1000 CVC days. Four (33%) episodes occurred in infants-a ratio of 1.06/1000 CVC days. Only 3 (5%) CVCs were removed due to infection and additional 28 (47.5%) were removed due to obstruction/clot/tear. The remaining 28 (47.5%) CVCs were either removed while properly functioning (17) or still in place (11). Mean CVC survival time for all children was 388 days and for infants-291 days. Conclusions: Very low CVC infection rates-one infection per 5 catheter years -and prolonged CVC survival times-more than one year -, are achievable in infants and children with ESRD receiving HD therapy by strictly adhering to practices designed to prevent infections.

Results: Comparing the results with European adult and UK NICE guidelines 65% of dialysis and 54% of transplant patients were anaemic. In dialysis patients predictors of anaemia were younger age, female gender, haemodialysis (HD), and a primary diagnosis (PRD) of pyelonephritis or Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome. Factors signifi cantly associated with being over the target range were older age and peritoneal dialysis (PD). In transplant patients predictors of anaemia were younger age, female gender and a PRD of glomerulonephritis, while being older, male and having a PRD of pyelonephritis were associated with a Hb level over the target. In both dialysis and transplantation groups, patients from Eastern Europe had the highest, and Western and Southern Europe had the lowest Hb levels, with a difference between these regions after adjustment of 1.5 mg/dl. Conclusions: Anaemia is a common and signifi cant problem in European children with ERF. Children on HD are more prone to anaemia than those on PD and those who have been transplanted. Younger children are most at risk. European guidelines are needed to help optimise the management of anaemia in children with ERF.

Hemorrhagic event, visual aspect of the Wednesday, September 1 ECC, nurses satisfaction and anti-Xa activity (U/mL) were recorded. Results: 172 HD sessions were evaluated in 7 patients aged from 2,3 to 17,4 (median: 13,1). 2 patients did not require any adjustment in tinzaparin dose while 5 needed increments of 20 to 62 % from the initial dose. Effective median tinzaparin dose was 73 UI/kg (range: 57-110). Clotting was observed in the air chamber traps in 46/172 sessions but only one was interrupted for massive clotting of ECC. Visual aspect scale of ECC showed signifi cant clotting and coagulated fi lter in 16 and 2 /172 sessions. No hemorrhagic event was reported. Nurses preferred tinzaparin over UFH for ease of administration and lack of monitoring. AntiXa activity with effective dose of tinzaparin ranged between 0.26 to 0.68 at mid-time, <0.1 to 0.24 at the end of the session.

There were more boys (54%) and higher incidence among the older age groups. The commonest cause of ESRD was glomerulonephritis (29%), renal dysplasia (15%) and neurogenic bladder (11%). 78% of patients were started on renal replacement therapy; 22% of patients was treated conservatively. The commonest cause for conservative treatment (18 children) was because of young age < 5 years old (10 children) and severe co-morbid conditions (5 children). PD was the fi rst treatment modality 86% compared to HD 14%. The commonest reasons for clinical encounters were fl uid overload (19% )and hypertension (19% ). At 1 year follow-up; 12% (8 children) on dialysis had died. The main causes of death were fl uid overload (3) and lack of dialysis access (2) . Conclusions: Paediatric renal replacement therapy in Malaysia is quite established by now but more need to be done for children < 5 years old. Fluid overload was the main cause of morbitiy and mortality among the cohort on renal replacement therapy. Results: Over a 20 year period 177 patients <19 years received PD in our unit. 23 are still on PD therapy. The median age of commencement was 9.25 years (interquartile range of 2.3 to 13.2 years). 23% were below the age of 2 years at PD start. The median duration of PD was 12.6 months in those who had ceased therapy (range 0.07 to 92.7 months) compared to a median of 11.6 months in those still on PD (range 2.8 to 35.5 months). 4 patients developed EPS. 1 was diagnosed at transplantation but was asymptomatic. She had been on PD for 19.9 months. The other 3 were male and were all symptomatic. Their durations of PD were 57.5, 70.5 and 92.7 months. 2 have died from the EPS. 1 has required peritonectomy. All 4 had lost peritoneal membrane function. 2 only recieved non biocompatible fl uids, 2 were treated with both. Whilst 3 had a number of episodes of peritonitis the child who required peritonectomy had none. Conclusions: In this cohort 2% of patients were known to have developed EPS but 27% of those treated >48 months developed it. All showed signs of membrane failure, 3 had recurrent peritonitis. PD is the mainstay of paediatric dialysis therapy. Patients who lose allografts may well return to PD. Carers need to know the risk of EPS increases with duration of PD. The length of PD in childhood needs to be recorded and passed onto adult clinics at transfer. Objectives: To study the type and incidence of complications of vascular access in children and adolescent who started hemodialysis (HD) treatment over 11 years period. Methods: A retrospective cohort study tha evaluate the type of initial vascular access and the incidence of complications of vascular access in children and adolescents aged 0 to younger than 18 years who started HD in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil from 1997 to 2007. Results: A total of 249 vascular accesses in 61 pts (33M, 28 F, median age 13.5 range 2.9-17.8 years), 97 permanent (94 arteriovenous fi stula -AVF and 3 grafts) and 152 temporary accesses (uncuffed CVC) were studied. CVC was the fi rst access in 51% of patients in the study. Patient weight did not infl uence the choice of CVC over AVF: 7 pts under 20 kg started HD using CVC and 7 AVF. However, for pts under 15 kg we detected a ratio of 3 CVC for 1 AVF. The main cause of CVC removal was infection in 35%, followed by the use of AVF in 37.8%. The median survival of the uncuffed CVC was 40 days. Primary failure of AVF was detected in 37.8% fi stulas. The median survival time of AVF was 54 months; main cause of AVF failure was thrombosis (84%). No AVF was lost due to infection. Conclusions: Infection was the major cause of uncuffed CVC removal and the risk of infection was 34 times higher in patients using uncuffed CVC vs AVF. Our results suggest that uncuffed CVC must be avoided for ESRD children on HD and replaced by AVF or cuffed CVC.",

The risk of AVF loss was 3.8 times higher in pts who started HD using a CVC compared to pts who have a patent AVF since the beginning of HD (p = 0.025), whose AVF survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years was 73%, 46% and 27% respectively; pts who started HD using a CVC had a AVF survival rate at 1, 3 and 5 years of 40%, 20% and 10 % respectively. Pts with uropathy had 3.2 greater risk of AVF loss compared with other pathologies (p = 0.012). The maturation time less than 90 days was also predictive of loss of AVF: the risk was 4.4 (p = 0.011). Conclusions: Our study identifi ed three independent predictive factors for AVF loss. Pts with uropathy have a higher risk of AVF loss and therefore, placement and use of vascular access in this group of patients should receive special care. Our results also suggest avoid AVF cannulation before 90 days after placement and avoiding the use of CVC as a vascular access for chronic pts.

The main clinical adverse effects were hypotension, chills, nausea and vomiting. Conclusions: LDL apheresis, is a well tolerated, safe, effective and a simple way of treating Homozygous FH pediatric patients. Combined with lipid-lowering drugs, LDL apheresis provides a safe and effective lowering of the mean LDL-C levels in pediatric homozygous FH. This technique is more simple than hemodialysis and pediatric nephrologists should be more involved in realizing this procedure in the future. Results: 4 different diameters of catheters were used: 11F (20 CVCs), 8F (53 CVCs), 7 F (5 CVCs) and 6 F (4 CVCs). The most common site of cannulation was right or left subclavian vein (66 CVCs, 80.5%). There were no complications seen in 57 CVCs (69.5%).

Objectives: To evaluate the peritonitis epidemiology in children in South Africa and to identify risk factors for peritonitis. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed. All children enrolled in the peritoneal dialysis program between 2000 and 2008 were analyzed. Baseline characteristics and potential risk factors were recorded, including: housing, socioeconomic circumstances, distance to PD centre, type of PD, mode of catheter placement, weight and height. Outcome indices for peritonitis were peritonitis rate, time to fi rst peritonitis and peritonitis free patients. All peritonitis episodes were analyzed concerning causative organism, severity of peritonitis (fungal or gram negative), catheter policy, occurrence of technique failure and survival. Results: 67 patients on PD for a total of 544 months were included. Total peritonitis episodes was 129. Median peritonitis rate was 0.23/patient month (range 0-1.76). Median time to fi rst infection was 2.03 months (range 0-21.5 months). 28.4% of patients remained peritonitis free. Patients with good housing and good socio-economic circumstances had a signifi cantly lower peritonitis rate and a longer time to fi rst peritonitis episode. No other risk factors were associated with peritonitis outcome. Conclusions: Peritonitis rate is high in this cohort compared tothe developed world. The characteristics of causative organisms are comparable. Most important risk factors for development of peritonitis are poor housing and poor socioeconomic circumstances. Objectives: To assess the feasibility and effi cacy of CAPD in children from families living under socioeconomic constraints. Methods: Retrospective study of children started on CAPD in the last 5 years at our hospital. Data was collected for the clinical profi le, details of CAPD, fi nancial status and living conditions of the families, complications and outcome. Results: 13 children mean age 6.9 years (range 2-11) were on CAPD. Straight 2 cuffed Tenckhoff catheter was surgically placed in all. Mean break in period was 8.7 days. Manual CPD with 4 cycles/day and fi ll volume of 1200ml/m2 was given. Due to fi nancial constraints and non availability of 1 litre bags all used 2 litre bags with 2 cycles from each bag making the CPD ambulatory for 2 cycles only.

Objectives: Due to numerous risks, neonatal CRRT is the most challenging aspect of this procedure. We present our 5-years experience with CRRT in neonates. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 17 neonates treated with CRRT over the last 5 yaars, including their sex, age, body weight, primary diagnosis, indications for the CRRT, number of failed organs and severity scores. Results: 11 male and 6 female neonates were treated, with mean age of 7.9 days (0-28) and weight 3,1kg (1.8-4.6). Mean PRISM III scores were 6.5, 7.2 and 5.5 on admission, at the beginning of CRRT, and after 24h of treatment, respectively. The difference of later two was signifi cant (p<0.05). The mean number of failed organs was 2.5 (1-6). Primary diagnosis was congenital metabolic disturbances in 5 (hyperammoniemia 3, MSUD 2), isolated renal failure in 4, MOD with renal failure in 8.Ten pts received CVVHDF, 6 CVVHD, and 1 CVVH. The mean duration of CRRT was 5.7 days, mean circuit life span 2.6 days and ultrafi ltrate rate 32.9 ml/kg/h. Overall survival rate was 70.5%; 100% in patient with 1-2 failed organs and 44.4% in patients with MOD (3 and more failed organs). Six patients had fl uid overload (>10% BW), 4 of them having ARF without MOD survived, and both patients with fl uid overload and MOD died. Conclusions: CRRT is a safe and effi cient procedure in the treatment of congenital metabolic disturbances and isolated renal failure in neonates.

Pavesi, G. Ardissino, A. Edefonti. Pediatric Nephrology and Radiology, Fondazione IRCCS Osp. Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy. Objectives: Sclerosing peritonitis is a rare but life-threatening complication of PD, characterized by peritoneal membrane (PM) proliferation, thickening and calcifi cation. The role of ultrasound (US) evaluation in this condition is not well established: we propose US screening to assess PM thickening in pts on PD. Methods: Between April and September 2009 we prospectively performed US peritoneal evaluation in 21 pts (16M) on PD, median age 6.4yrs (0.6-27); median PD duration was 27.6mo. (0.1-108). We studied the PM with high frequency probe at 3 different ventral windows, at a distance of at least 10cm from the peritoneal catheter insertion. Results: 12 pts (57%) showed a PM thickness \u22641mm (reference normal upper limit), 5 pts (24%) between 1 and 1.5mm and 4 pts (19%) >1.5mm. 2 out of 4 pts in the last group also showed small bowel loops fi xed and tethered posteriorly as well as symptoms of subocclusion. The regression lines between PM thickness and PD duration and the number of peritonitis, showed a statistically signifi cant correlation (r:0,85, p<0,0001 and r:0,56, p<0,001, respectively). Conclusions: CT is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of sclerosing peritonitis, however it encompasses high radiation dose and is not suitable for repeated examinations. Our data suggest that US examination represents a safe tool to monitor PM changes during PD, allowing good peritoneal visualisation and dynamic evidence of small bowel distribution that can correlate with clinical symptoms even when they are still mild. We suggest to address all PD patients to US peritoneal screening once every 6 mo. . Both CVC types were tunnelled through subcutaneous tissue, the tip was positioned at the atrial-cava junction or just inside the right atrium. Indications for CVC placement were cardiac congenital malformations, low body weight (BW) or inadequacy of venous outfl ow, which contraindicated AV fi stula creation. Results: Survival of Perm-cath and Ash-split CVC at 100 days was 18% and 40% respectively. The access was lost because of bacteremia (1 case in each CVC group), malfunction (5 and 2) and dislodgement (4 and 2) . Complications of CVC insertion were bleeding from the jugular vein which required surgical correction in 1 pts after Perm-cath placement and hemothorax due to subclavian artery puncture during Ash-split placement in 1 pts. Mean dialytic URR in pts with the Ash-split CVC and BW <20 kg was 77.1\u00b18.5%, higher than that of pts with Ash-split CVC and BW >20 kg (53.1\u00b17.0%, p<0.005) and not different from that achieved with Perm-cath (79.2\u00b17.3%).",

Methods: Twice a year representatives from all 9 centres convene to discuss patient data from all centres. Data on treatment and outcomes are registered centrally and monitored according to GCP standards. A questionnaire about ESRD patient management policies was sent to all centers at baseline.

Indications to start RRT included clinical condition in all centers; additionally, some centers mentioned low GFR, uremia or hyperphosphatemia. The preferred treatment modality in all centers was renal transplantation, below the age of 3 years peritoneal dialysis. Contrary to the offi cial local policy, in children older than 3 years with no residual diuresis hemodialysis was applied most frequently.

Results: Peritoneal transport kinetics of \u03b22-microglobulin and cystatin C was linear for both solutions, but slightly higher with Ico than Glu suggesting a better effi ciency for low-molecular weight molecules. There was a linear correlation between total protein removal during Ico and Glu dialysis in the same patient, suggesting that removal is a function of peritoneal membrane characteristics. The ratio between proteins removed by Ico and by Glu solutions was higher at low removal rate. Image gel analysis revealed a complex protein composition of PE (1064 and 774 spots respectively in Ico and Glu solutions, 524 of which were common to both conditions); 314 spots were higher in Ico compared to Glu PE.

Objectives: To assess the state of renal replacement therapy for children in Poland, where unrestricted treatment became available following political transformation in 1989. Methods: A National RRT Registry set up in 2000 accumulated individual patient data of all children receiving dialysis or Tx at 13 pediatric dialysis centers. Data of 779 children aged 0-18 years was analyzed. Incidence rates, causes of CKD and choice of initial therapy were calculated for the different 5 year age groups. Results: The standardized annual incidence of CKD5 was 6.4 per million age related population (pmarp) and was highest for the 0-4 age group (7.1 pmarp). CAKUT and genetic diseases accounted for 58% of all causes of CKD5. CAKUT was the predominant diagnostic category in all 5 year age groups (1.6-3.4 pmarp), followed by genetic diseases (2.0 and 1.2 pmarp) in 0-4 and 5-9 year olds and glomerular diseases (1.4 and 1.8 pmarp) in 10-14 and 15-18 year age groups. The preferred initial mode of therapy was PD (62%), followed by HD (32%) and PET (6%). HD was the most frequent choice (49%) only in the 14-18 age groups. Conclusions: 1. There is unrestricted access to RRT for all pediatric age groups in Poland with a similar incidence rate to that of West European countries. 2. There is a free choice of both PD and HD modes of treatment with a disproportionately low choice of PET. 3. Slowing progression is the major procedure for decreasing the incidence of CKD5 as nearly 60% of its causes in east european children are congenital and/or genetic.

Given that hepcidin may be signifi cantly cleared by hemodialysis (HD) we sought to compare serum hepcidin levels between pediatric peritoneal (PD) and HD patients (pts). Methods: Serum hepcidin levels were measured in 26 PD and 30 HD pts by competitive ELISA and compared to indicators of anemia, infl ammation and iron status. In addition, hepcidin clearance was determined by measuring serum hepcidin before, during and after HD in 8 pts.",

Conclusions: Elevated AF in CKD indicate for the accumulation of tissue AGEs. A signifi cant association between AF and investigated markers supports a role for AGEs as a contributor to vascular damage and shows that AF may be a good, easily applicable tool for assessing the risk of atherosclerosis development and cardiovascular events in CKD children.

Arterial stiffening advances with age and is accelerated in specifi c disease conditions. In childhood aPWV has not been investigated in larger cohorts.

Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess pulse pressure (PP) and ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) in children with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DMT1) compared to non-diabetic normotensive children. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) records in 84 children (43 boys) with DMT1. Based on offi ce BP and ABPM, patients with DMT1 were divided into 3 groups [true hypertension (DM HTN) 24/84, normotension (DM NT) 33/84, white coat hypertension (DM WCH) 27/84] and compared with 27 normotensive controls (NT). PP and AASI (regression analysis of diastolic on systolic BP values corrected by the regression coeffi cient) were obtained from ABPM. Results: DM NT, DM WCH and DM HTN did not differ in metabolic control, but DM HTN had signifi cantly longer duration of DMT1 and signifi cantly higher 24h, day and night BP on ABPM than DM NT, DM WCH and NT controls (p< 0.0001).

Objectives: Primary aldosteronism(PA) is a frequent cause of secondary hypertension in adults and is suspected with an aldosterone-renin ratio(ARR)>25. In children its prevalence and normal ARR are unknown.We characterised serum aldosterone(SA), Plasma Renin Activity(PRA) and ARR in pediatric normotensive healthy population. Methods: Prospective study, 211 healthy normotensive subjects (4-16 years) . SA, PRA, ARR and DNA were obtained. They were divided in 2 groups: normotensive children with hipertensive parents(NH) and normotensive children with normotensive parents(NN). ARR cut off was established using the 97 th percentile(P 97 ) and mean plus two standard deviation(X+2SD). Results: In total group, SA was 7.5\u00b15.9 ng/dL, PRA 2.7\u00b11.8 ng/mL/h and ARR 3.8\u00b1 6.2, subgroups values were similar. Systolic blood pressure was higher in NH than NN group.1 subject in the NH group had a chimeric CYP11B1/ CYP11B2 gene. The P 97 and X+2SD values for ARR in NH group was 15 and 20.1 and in the NN group was 13.5 and 9.8 respectively. SA and PRA were negatively correlated with age and body fat percentage. ARR was not correlated with age or body fat in the 3 groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the normal ARR in pediatric healthy normotensive population without hypertensive parents is surprisingly lower than those communicated for adult population. We propose a new cut off point for ARR that should be >10 to be used as screening in the diagnosis of PA in pediatric population Supported by Chilean Grant Fondecyt 1100356 2 Pediatric Nephrology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

Methods: Plasma levels of uric acid, IL-18, IL-1\u03b2, ICAM-1, MCP-1, adiponectin, TBARS and 8-Isoprostanes and CIMT were measured in newly diagnosed, untreated obese (BMI>95th perc.) and nonobese children with primary HTN and compared with normotensive obese and nonobese children. Results: 29 children (age14\u00b12 yrs) were enrolled: 10 hypertensive (7 obese; 3 nonobese), 19 controls (9 obese, 10 nonobese). Plasma infl ammatory and oxidative stress markers did not differ signifi cantly between children with or without HTN; CIMT tended to be increased in hypertensive children compared to controls (p=0.26). Obese children with or without HTN had higher uric acid and increased CIMT compared to nonobese children. Objectives: Obesity is likely one of the major causes of the increased prevalence of hypertension in children.The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of obesity and its association with hypertension in Iranian children.",

Objectives: Familial hyperaldosteronism type I(FH-1) or glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a chimeric gene(CG) CYP11B1/CYP11B2. Its prevalence and clinical presentation in pediatric population is not well defi ned. Our aim is to report the prevalence of FH-1 in hypertensive children and to describe their clinical and biochemical characteristics. Methods: We studied 120 untreated hypertensive children aged 4 to 15 years. Plasma potassium(K), Plasma Renin activity(PRA) and serum aldosterone(SA) were measured. If aldosterone-renin ratio(ARR)>25,detection of CG was performed using long-extension PCR. Results: In 4/120(3.3%) children ARR was>25. Genetic study confi rmed a CG in all of them. They belonged to unrelated families, 21 fi rst relatives were studied(9 affected), making a total of 13 patients. Severe hypertension 9/13, pre-hypertension 3/13 and normotension 1/13. PRA was suppressed 6/13, hypokalemia in 3/13, high SA level 10/13 (range 8. Objectives: In the last years the detection of pediatric hypertension (HYT) has increased considerably.

There were no differences between patients with THTN and WCH in amplitudes/acrophases, LVM SDS and AASI. No signifi cant correlation was found between BPR and TOD (LVM SDS, albuminuria); however, 24h and 12h amplitudes inversely correlated with the AASI (r\u00b2=-0.39, p<0.01 and r\u00b2=-0.29, p=0.01, respectively). Conclusions: Children with primary and white coat hypertension had similar blood pressure rhythmicity, which was not correlated to target organ damage. However, decreased blood pressure amplitude was associated with increased arterial stiffness. This fi nding suggests that abnormal blood pressure rhythmicity may lead to early vascular dysfunction in children with hypertension.",

            "text": "Not Ready for Prime Time: Aliskiren for Treatment of Hypertension or Proteinuria in Children J.T. Flynn. Nephrology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, United States. Objectives: Aliskiren, the fi rst orally active direct renin inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in treatment of hypertension (HTN) in adults and may also reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To date, no controlled studies of aliskiren have been conducted in children, but off-label use may be considered by some practitioners. Methods: An e-mail survey of the PEDHTN and PEDNEPH listservs was conducted to solicit information on off-label use of aliskiren in children. Results: Information on 9 patients was supplied from 5 centers. Mean age was 11.6y (range, 4-17y) . Underlying diagnoses included renal disease (7), primary HTN (1)and unspecifi ed (1). Indications for use of aliskiren included HTN (5) and proteinuria (6) (2 patients were treated for both HTN and proteinuria). Doses used ranged from 37.5-300 mg/day; no information was provided on dosing by body weight or surface area. All children were receiving at least 1 other antihypertensive medication at the time aliskiren was started; most were receiving multiple medications (range, [2] [3] [4] [5] . Aliskiren treatment was considered successful in 3 patients, partially successful in 2 patients, unsuccessful in one patient and not specifi ed in 3 patients. Adverse effects reported included hypotension, angioedema and hyperkalemia (1 patient with each). Aliskiren was either withdrawn or the dose was reduced in 4 patients because of adverse effects or lack of clinical benefi t. Results: Fourteen children were diagnosed with renovascular hypertension. Four (28%) were found to have HHS, all presented with polyuria and polydipsia, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic alkalosis, variable tubular dysfunction and nephrotic range proteinuria along with hypertension. In one patient, glomerular and tubular abnormalities preceded the development of hypertension. Symptoms resolved after resolution of ischemia following percutaneous angioplasty. Conclusions: HHS is probably more common than previously thought and is reversible after correction of underlying renal artery stenosis. Objectives: In contrast to the general population, total adiponectin is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite increased cardiovascular disease (CVD). Adiponectin circulates as trimer, low-molecular-weight (LMW) and highmolecular-weight (HMW) complexes. The distribution and role of each subfraction in CKD is unknown. We hypothesized that imbalances in the subfractions rather then total adiponectin is associated with increased CV risk in children with CKD. Methods: Total adiponectin and subfractions were measured cross-sectionally in a sub-cohort (n=105) of patients from the CKiD study. Uni-and multi-variate log-linear regression was used to quantify the relationships between adiponectin fractions and CV risk factors. Objectives: Pediatric obesity is reaching epidemic fi gures. It has been argued that insulin resistance (IR) is the fi siopathological link between obesity and hypertension. Several molecules produced by the adipose tissue (adipokines) have been implicated in the pathology of both processes, indicating the existence of a low grade infl ammatory state in the base of atherosclerosis.We aimed to analyse the association between blood pressure (BP), insulin resistance and adipokines in obese children and adolescents.

These patients present an interval of 10-12 hours between the last CIC performed before bedtime and the fi rst CIC in the morning. After adjusting the CIC and after an 8-hour sleep if the case awakes dry and the urine volume at fi rst ICI is considered the nocturnal bladder capacity. After such an evaluation in 6 cases, a midnight CIC is suggested. Generally, CIC only during daytime is not found adequate. Objectives: Meningomyelocele (MMC) is a common neural development disorder. The objective of this study was to evaluate the infl uence of ambulatory status of children with MMC on clinical fi ndings and renal outcome. Methods: The records of 95 children with MMC followed up at least a year from 2005 to 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Ambulatory status was classifi ed as independent walkers (walks without assistive appliances), assisted walkers (requires walking aid), and non-ambulatory (wheelchair bound). Demographic, clinical and radiological characteristics of the patients were evaluated according to the ambulatory status. Results: Ninety-fi ve patients (53 boys and 42 girls) were enrolled to the study. The median follow-up of was 55 months ( 12 to199 months). Forty-six patients (49.5 %) were operated during the fi rst three days of life. Ninety-two (97.9%) had lomber, 3 had (3.3%) thoracal defects. The technetium dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan showed unilateral renal parenchymal scarring (RPS) in fourteen (21.5%) patients and bilateral RPS in 6 (9.2%) patients. Eighteen patients (26.9%) had vesicoureteral refl ux (VUR). Seventy-three children (76.8%) were non-ambulatory, 14 of the children (14.7%) were assisted walkers and 8 of them (8.4%) were independent walkers. Patients whose follow-ups started at an early age showed less hydronephrosis at USG and deformed bladder at VCUG. Ambulatory status was not found to have infl uence on operation time, frequent UTI, hydronephrosis, VUR, renal parenchimal scarring of the patients. Conclusions: Our data shows that ambulatory status of children with MMC does not affect the clinical fi ndings and renal outcome. (3), enuresis (2) . Surgical procedures employed: valve ablation alone 29 (60.4%), vesicostomy alone 12 (25.0%), cutaneous ureterostomies in combination with other surgeries 7 (14.5%) patients. Median time from confi rmation to primary surgery was 8.5 days (IQR 6-15days). At end of follow-up, GFR could be estimated for 37 patients, 20 (54.1%) of which were in stage 1 CKD. Only 1 (2.7%) had reached ESRF over 5.25 years; he has undergone successful renal transplant with functioning graft after 4 years 2 months (serum creatinine 48 \u00b5mol/l). No death recorded but signifi cant numbers (29%) lost to follow up. Prognostic factors identifi ed were serum creatinine at presentation and at 1 year of age, nadir serum creatinine 1-year post surgery. Conclusions: PUV could be successfully managed in Africa to decrease disease progression to ESRF.

Objectives: The term inherited hypokalemic disorder involves a set of renal-tubular diseases that present with normal blood pressure, hyperreninemia and hypokalemia. The management has improved over the last years and the issue of pregnancy has become important for the patients. Therefore, we extensively review reported information on pregnancies and neonatal-postneonatal outcome in children born to affected females. Furthermore we report our experience. Methods: There were 93 pregnancies (literature, N=88; our experience, N=5) in 45 women with Gitelman syndrome (N=25), antenatal Bartter syndrome (N=1) or an unclassifi ed hypokalemic disorder (N=19). Results: There were 12 spontaneous abortions and 6 terminations. Pregnancy was associated with a decline in potassium level. Drug management included supplementation with potassium in all, with magnesium in at least 19, and with potassium-sparing diuretics in 11 pregnancies. A term or near term birth was noted in the 75 pregnancies. Babies exposed in utero to potassium sparing diuretics were also found to be normal. Somatic growth and neuropsychological development are currently normal in 5 subjects aged between 1 and 18, median 10 years born to 4 patients with the biochemical and molecular diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome, who are on follow up at our institutions. Conclusions: Females affected by inherited hypokalemic disorders can become pregnant and the disorder may be managed without outward effect on the fetus and with an excellent long-term outcome. Objectives: CNS is classifi ed in two types: Finnish type and other,including diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS).WT1 gene mutations have been demonstrating in some pts with DMS.Monozygous twins with CNS and early onset of ESRD and their genetic analysis are presented. Methods: Female twins from fi rst pregnancy without polyhydramnion and normal placenta were born at 32 g.w. with 46 XX karyotype, normal female phenotype. On admission at the age of 2 months edema, ascites, oliguria/ anuria, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, low IgG, low ATIII, proteinuria (12g/L in a girl with oliguria) were presented. USG showed a small kidney enlargement,parenchymal hyperechogenicity and poor corticomedullary differentiation. Girls reached ESRD within a few weeks. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) was started with a shift to CVVH/CVVHD in one of them. This one died at the age of 23 weeks.Preliminary light microscopy showed DMS. Results: After excluding the most common CNS mutations (NPHS1,2), direct sequencing of a WT1 gene (exon 8 and 9) revealed the presence of an identical heterozygous mutation R417R in boths girls. Objectives: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most -common inherited cystic kidney diseases and can lead to chronic renal failure. In this study, we utilized siRNA technology to knock down the polycystin 1 protein expression in immortalized renal tubular cell line to investigate the future study. Methods: Stable knockdown of PC1 in M-1 mouse CCD cells were achieved by lipo-polymeric formulation with a specifi c small interfering RNA for Pkd1. After transfection, stable clone of miRNA PKD1 cell lines were sorted by FACS and selected by blasticidin. For immunodetection, cells were lysed and detected by rabbit anti-PC1 polyclonal antibody. Proliferation assay was performed and tubulogenesis and cysts formation were investigated in an ice-cold matrigel solution. Results: Polycystin 1 knock-down cell miRNA 6820 exhibited signifi cant effects on cell proliferation at 24h later to 120h cell cultures. According to the GFP fl uorescence intensity, miRNA 6820 cells could be sorted by high and low fl uorescence. Down regulation of polycystin 1 protein in transcriptional level were confi rmed by RT-PCR and real time PCR and these were parallel to the intensity of GFP. Cysts formation presented in 3-D matrigel system and low expression of polycystin 1 cell line would produce larger cysts. Conclusions: Polycystin 1 knock-down cell lines were set up successful and their cellular biologic behaviors would present as human ADPKD. These cell lines will provide as a good in vitro cellular model to investigate further cellular mechanical signal pathway of cyst formation in future.",

Methods: USc of urinary tract (UT) was performed on an unselected population of 2471 healthy infants (1276 boys and 1195 girls). All of them had normal result of prenatal USc of UT. Out of a total number of postnataly screened infants, 1749 of them were followed up for 5-60 months regarding the presence of UTI or urinary tract anomalies (UTA). Results: In the examined group, 58 infants (2.3%) had UTA, while 33 (1.3%) infants with UTA had DCS. UTI was found in 16 (48.5%) infants with DCS, and in 146 (8.5%) out of 1716 followed infants without DCS. Other CUTA were found in 6 (18.1%) infants with DCS. Pyelocaliceal dilation (PCD) was found in 13 infants with DCS. In that group UTI was found in 10 (77%) infants, while in the rest of 20 infants with DCS, UTI was found in 5 (25%) of them. Conclusions: Postnatal USc of UT in children is an useful and valuable method for detecting DCS. Our results indicate that DCS in infants increases the risk for UTI approximately 5.7 times and for other CUTA 7.9 times, compared to an unselected population. Moreover, children with DCS associated with PCD have a triple greater risk for UTI than those with DCS only. Early diagnosis of DCS warns about the increase of UTI and CUTA possibility, so we recommend the postnatal USc of UT in all children during the fi rst months of life in order to prevent kidney damage.",

Hoppe. 1 1 Pediatric Nephrology, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany; 2 Pediatric Radiology, University Hospital, Cologne, Germany. Objectives: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is always accompanied by congenital hepatic fi brosis (CHF), characterized by hyperplastic bile ducts and portal fi brosis. We here describe diagnostic criteria and the clinical course of liver involvement in 18 patients now aged 0.3-21 years. Methods: Duration of clinical observation varied between 0.3 to 17.9 years. Type and degree of liver involvement was determined by laboratory tests and (Duplex) sonography, in some by MR-cholangiography, oesophago-gastroscopy or liver biopsy. Results: In all patients with liver biopsy (9/9), CHF was histologically confi rmed, however, clinical follow up was heterogenous. Caroli syndrome was identifi ed with ultrasound and confi rmed by MR-cholangiography in 5 patients. A portal hypertensive form was found in 4 children. Patients with Caroli syndrome demonstrated at younger age a hepatic manifestation with portal hypertension in two patients expressed as gastro-esophageal varicosis. Also, prominent accompanying complications were found in the other patients with portal hypertension. Duplex sonography showed re-canalized umbilical as well as periportal veins in 2 patients. Endoscopically, esophageal varices were found in 6 of 11 patients. Reasons for liver or liver-kidney transplantation were either severe esophageal hemorrhage requiring sclerotherapy, or recurrent cholangitis and esophageal hemorrhage, or cholangitis and renal failure. Conclusions: Hence, specifi c attention has to be paid to liver involvement in patients with ARPKD, as it adds signifi cant long term problems and morbidity. Objectives: Reduction of parenchymal thickness (PT) detected by ultrasound examination is one of the criteria for surgery in obstructive uropathy. In a solitary kidney (SK) with obstruction, determination of severe reduction of the parenchyma is diffi cult. This is due to the fact that as the SK develops, hypertrophy of the parenchyma occurs. As a result, the reduction may be misrepresented. Moreover, there is no comparison with a healthy kidney. Therefore, a study was performed to determine normal PT in children with a healthy functionally SK. Methods: The prospective multicenter study comprised 163 children, aged 11 days to 18.96 years (mean age 6.46 years; 64% males). The function of the SK was confi rmed by a DMSA scan. All the children had normal glomerular fi ltration rates. In addition to other parameters, the thickness of the renal parenchyma was measured during an ultrasound examination of the SK. The study assessed the dependence of PT on the children's age, height and weight (non-parametric Spearman's correlation analysis).",

Linear dependence was only revealed between the thickness of the renal parenchyma and body height. The correlation coeffi cient for height was 0.837. The linear regression equation was y=0.087x+5.902. The coeffi cient of determination was R 2 =0.665. Conclusions: Parenchymal thickness in a functionally SK is well correlated with the body height. The 5th and 95th percentiles were estimated for PT in a SK depending on the body height. Objectives: We report a 3 years old female who was born from unconsanguineous Turkish parents. Results: On the physical examination; head circumference, weight and length were under the 3 rd percentiles and high blood presure. Her psychomotor and mental development was severely delayed. She's malformations include long face, frontal bossing, bitemporal depression,asymmetric ears, radial deviation of both wrists, clinodactyly, rudimentation and ulnar deviation of fi rst fi nger of left hand, aplasia of fi rst fi nger of right hand, bilateral radial hypoplasia, sacral agenesis, developmental hip dsyplasia and bilateral equinovarus. On the laboratory fi ndings echocardiography demonstrated a secundum ASD, abdominal US showed bilateral pelvicaliectasy, MCUG showed bilateral grade 5 VUR.

Conclusions: In our knowledge vena cava inferior agenesis association with skeletal anomalies and mental motor retardation has not been reported in lecture so far. We offer stillborn or infants with limb anomalies would better evaluated for especially urinary tract anomalies. Because early diagnosis is crucial in such cases as potential targeted therapy (either surgical or conservative) might prevent irreversible damage of renal parenchyma. Objectives: The simple renal pyelectasis (SRP) is defi ned as a moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis in the absence of vesicoureteral refl ux or urinary tract obstruction. Recently, we described that might indicate a genetic predisposition to suffer from urolithiasis in adulthood. We have studied the longitudinal renal function in a group of children with SRP. Methods: We included 44 children (34M, 10F). The age at initial study (S1) was 104.8 \u00b1 93.1 days (range: 4-330 days). The age at the fi nal study (S2) was 3.6 \u00b1 2.5 years (range: 1.02-10.5 years). We determined the maximum urine osmolality (Uosm) after stimulation with desmopressin and urinary albumin/creatinine (Alb/ cr) and N-acetilglucosaminidasa/creatinine (NAG/cr). Results: In S2, Uosm values were signifi cantly higher than in S1 (938.3 \u00b1 138.4 vs. 574.3 \u00b1 135.3, p<0.001). Similarly, in S2 values of MAU/cr (1.4 \u00b1 1.7 vs. 5.6 \u00b1 4.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5mol, p<0.001) and NAG/cr (4.2 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 18.9 \u00b1 19.6 U/g, p = 0.001) were signifi cantly lower than in S1. In S1, 18/44 infants (40.9%) showed renal concentrating defect and S2 only 8/44 children (18.2%). In S1, 11/35 (31.4%) had the ratio Alb/cr high and S2 only 4/36 (10%). In 26/44 (59.1%) of families, family history of urolithiasis were in fi rst and/or second generations. Conclusions: The SRP is a benign process. It is unknown why some patients have impared renal function initially although a progressive improvement of the same one exists.",

The target is to show a case born in our service with all his clinical characteristics and his renal biopsy. Methods: we check his clinical chart and his renal biopsy. Results: This was a 35-week, 1,995-g infant of a 35-year-old pregnant woman who had been treated with lisinopril throughout her pregnancy for hypertension. Spontaneous rupture of membranes and fetal distress led to the premature delivery of the infant who was noted to have severe oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, hypocalvaria, profound hypotension, and renal failure with a renal ultrasound that showed big-sized kidneys.[/bold] Renal biopsy at 8 weeks, which showed tubular focal dilation and absent differentiation of proximal convoluted tubules. These fi nding are known like disgenesia tubular renal typical from the defi cit of angiotensina during the fetal period. Conclusions: We conclude that ACE inhibitor induced renal tubular dysgenesis is an unusual but important cause of acute renal failure neonatal. ACE inhibitors have been shown to cause fetal toxicity, including profound fetal hypotension, anuria, oliguria, and growth restriction. The best strategy to prevent ACE fetopathy is to aggressively educate physicians and the public that these drugs should not be used during the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Objectives: Congenital nephritic syndrome (CNS) is often complicated with thrombosis. We had a patient with CNS complicated with brain infarction developed during fetal period. Since complication of congenital brain infarction with CNS has not been reported before, the possibility of prenatal onset and the time point of brain infarction is discussed. Methods: A 10-month-old boy without family history was born at 38 weeks of gestation and weighed 2510g. Giant placenta was noted at birth. No abnormalities were noted in his growth and development. He was transferred at 2 months of age to our hospital suspected of nephritic syndrome. A high level of proteinuria was noted, and extensive brain infarction was identifi ed by diagnostic imaging. Genetic analysis revealed no mutations. Renal biopsy established the diagnosis of CNS of the Finnish type. Results: Although MRI/MRA identifi ed old brain infarction in the left middle cerebral artery region, no neurological abnormalities were observed before hospitalization. Since formation of a secondary cerebral sulcus was observed at the infarction site, onset of infarction was estimated to be 32 weeks of gestation or later. The fractional excreation of total protein (FETP) was 0.5, and the prenatal FETP was estimated to be 0.05, assuming a prenatal GFR of 10 ml/min. This suggested a theoretical possibility that hyperproteinuria and hypoproteinemia might have developed during fetal life to trigger prenatal brain infarction. Conclusions: We had a patient with CNS of the Finnish type complicated with brain infarction occurred during fetal period.",

There was no signifi cant relation in between the degree of the hydronephrosis of the kidneys with or without VUR. Conclusions: Predicting postnatal genitourinary pathologies in patients with antenatal hydronephrosis by means of renal USG is very important for the clinician. Even if the fi rst postnatal USG is normal, USG should be repeated in 4 weeks. Mild and modarate hydronephrosis should be followed with USG. For mild, moderate an even severe hydronephrosis, we recommend to delay performing a VCU as much as possible, considering the electromagnetic radiation exposure. Objectives: Primary vesicoureteral refl ux (VUR), especially low grade, resolves in time spontaneously in most cases. We aimed to evaluate if the rate of anthropometric development of children affects the closure of VUR. Methods: Children with primary low grade (I to III) VUR were grouped as those with spontaneous closure (Group 1) and those without spontaneous closure (Group 2). All children were evaluated retrospectively for height SDS, weight SDS and BMI at the time of diagnosis and yearly thereafter until the last voiding cystography. In addition, the rate of increase in height and weight for each year was evaluated for all children. Both groups were compared with respect to these parameters. Results: Group 1 (n=32) and Group 2 (n=10) were similar for sex, age at diagnosis and follow up period. With regard to anthropometric development, only height SDS was different between the Group 1 and Group 2 at the time of diagnosis (-0.10\u00b11.18 vs 0.93\u00b11.20, p=0,022). At the end of follow up period, none of the parameters were different between these groups. In addition, no difference was determined for the evaluated parameters within each group at the time of diagnosis and at the last cystography. Conclusions: Although VUR resolves in time, we could not demonstrate that the rate of anthropometric development affect the closure of low grade VUR.",

Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical Universtiy, Chongqing, China; Centre for Lipid Research, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the characteristics of urinary system diseases and the role of the ultrasound screening and urinalysis screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in asymptomatic children in China. Methods: Between September 2008 and November 2008, 14 256 children excluding those with obvious symptoms and signs were enrolled in our study. All the subjects accepted ultrasound and urinary screening. A case-control study was performed to evaluate the relative risk of having stones in those children exposed to melamine formula. Results: Of the enrolled children, 6.10% (869 of 14 256) showed abnormalities, of which 409 (2.87%) were established by ultrasound, 572 (4.01%) by urinalysis and 112(0.79%) by both ultrasound screening and urinalysis. The abnormalities included congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract, urinary stones and/ or hydronephrosis, leucocyturia and haematuria and/or proteinuria. Children exposed to melamine formula were 5.17 times as likely to have kidney stones as children exposed to no-melamine formula (95% confi dence interval, 3.28-8.14; P < 0.001); the probability of kidney stones in melamine-fed infants were 6.28 times as likely as those no melamine-fed (95% confi dence interval, 3.71-10.65; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Ultrasonography and urinalysis could complement each other and play important roles in the early diagnosis of anomalies of the urinary system, but urinalysis is a more cost-effective screening tool for CKD in children in China. Exposure to melamine-contaminated formula associated with urinary stones, especially in infants, was signifi cantly higher than the control group. Objectives: Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are widely used drugs for hypertension and heart failure. Recent reports show that the maternal use of them may induce ACEI/ARB fetopathy, characterized by the symptoms such as oligohydramios, neonatal pulmonary hypoplasia, renal insuffi ciency, limb contracture, fetal hypotension, and so on. To date, there are few reports on ARB fetopathy. We report a case with NDI followed by neonatal renal failure due to fetal ARB exposure. Results: Case: a 2-year-old boy His 28-year-old mother had treated hypertension with valsartan throughout pregnancy. He was born at a gestational age of 34 weeks with 2308g body weight, 47cm length, APGAR score 7/8. He was transferred to our NICU, where transient tachypnea due to mild pulmonary hypoplasia, renal dysfunction and hypocalvaria was managed with oxygen supply and intravenous fl uid support for several days. These outcomes were favorable and he was discharged on day 35. At the age of 2 years, he developed polydipsia and polyuria and admitted to our hospital to evaluate his renal function. His plasma / urinary osmolality were 281 / 189 mOsm respectively, which suggested diabetes insipidus. Water deprivation test revealed maximum urine osmolality of 167mOsm/kg with no response to the injection of arginin vasopressin. As a result, we could diagnose him as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Conclusions: Among a few reports of ARB fetopathy, cases with NDI are rare. More attentions should be paied for the occurrence of late-onset complications on the cases with ACEI/ARB fetopathy. Results: 100 children with PUJo were reviewed. This constituted 133 renal units with PUJo. The male: female ratio was 4:1; the left kidney was most commonly affected in 40%. 70% of those with hydronephrosis confi rmed to be secondary to PUJo regressed spontaneously at 6 months of follow up while the rest progressed at variable interval over the 12 months of review of each case. Mostly all the children (99%) with the disease were antenatally diagnosed. 19 (14.3%) had surgery in the form of pyeloplasty, 31% of this number had surgery in the fi rst 6 months of life. 11 children had confi rmed UTI and the commonest organism isolated was Klebsiella pneumoniae followed by E coli. Outcome of surgical management showed that there was overall improvement in function (MAG3) renogram and decrease of AP pelvis diameter at 12 months of follow up. Conclusions: Pelviureteric junction obstruction is an important and common cause of prenatal hydronephrosis. Signifi cant proportion of children had spontaneous regression of hydronephrosis, however a few had surgical intervention with appreciable improvement of renal function.",

Objectives: Congenital abnormality of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) accounts for 20% of all anomalies diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound(US). As Cystatin C (Cys C) is a sensible marker for renal function in neonates, we compared Cys C at birth in neonates with prenatal diagnosed of CAKUT with Cys C in normal neonates. Methods: In the control group, 100 neonates with normal prenatal US were recruited and Cys C was measured at birth to obtain reference interval. In the same period, Cys C was measured in 19 neonates, with CAKUT, diagnosed on prenatal US (13 dilated kidneys(K) >10mm \u00b1dilated ureters; 3 dysplastic K, 2 multicystic K disease, 1 megabladder). Among these, 11 had one kidney anomaly the 8 others have two kidneys involved. Results: The 19 patients(pts) with CAKUT were comparable in gestational age, weight and size to the control group. In the control group, Cys C reference interval was [1.55-2.66 mg/l] with a mean (M) value of Cys C of 2.04 \u00b1 0.27SD. In the 19 pts with CAKUT, M Cys C was 2.18 \u00b1 0.44SD and the difference between the 2 groups was not signifi cant (P=0.069). However the M Cys C (2.43 \u00b1 0.38SD) was signifi cantly higher in pts with bilateral kidney anomalies compared to pts with only one kidney involved (M Cys C of 1.9 \u00b1 0.4SD) (p=0.03), and to the pts from the control group (P=0.00037). Conclusions: Cys C is a sensible marker of renal function in neonates with CAKUT. Preliminary results showed signifi cant increased of Cys C in neonates with both kidney involved compared to one or to the control group.",

Pediatric Nephrology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Objectives: The aim and objective of the study was to see the correlation of hypertension with renal function and renal function with obstructive uropathy. Methods: In this study 41 different types of obstructive uropathy patients with age range from 4 months to 14 years (Mean age: 5.7 \u00b1 2.3 years) were enrolled. Patients were diagnosed by detailed history, physical examination and relevant imaging studies like ultrasound of the kidney, ureter, bladder region with post voidal residue, micturating cystourethrogram, DMSA and DTPA renogram with total and split renal function. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stagings were done by Schwarts formula. Results: Important observation of this study were out of 41 patients 11 (26.88%) had hypertension 30(73.17%) were normotensive. Among the hypertensive patients 5 (45.45%) were in stage V (mean Ccr 10.7 \u00b1 2.57 ml/1.73 m 2 /min) and 2 (18.18%) were in stage IV (mean Ccr 22.4 \u00b1 7.58 ml/1.73 m 2 /min) CKD, which is statistically signifi cant (P<0.001). When normotensive patients were considered 13(40.62%), 5(15.62%) and 4(13.33%) were in stage III, IV and V CKD respectively. On the other hand, when CKD status were correlated with types of obstructive uropathy posterior urethral valve 25 (61%) were present in the majority cases and all (100%) of the patients had different grades of CKD. Conclusions: It was observed from this study, patients with CKD due to obstructive uropathy may be normotensive ever in stage V CKD, and posterior urethral valve was the commonest cases of obstructive uropathy in children. Objectives: Antenatal echogenic kidneys suggest differential diagnoses of polycystic (PKD), cystic dysplastic (CDK) or multicystic dysplastic (MCDK) kidneys. Postnatal prognosis is guided by the liquor volume, any other system anomalies and presence of parental renal cysts. We aim to study the postnatal outcome in children with antenatally diagnosed echogenic kidneys. Methods: A retrospective case note review was undertaken. The spectrum of postnatal investigations (renal function, ultrasonography of kidneys) and clinical course (blood pressure, need for medication, or renal replacement) over a fi ve year follow up period is presented here. Results: In the 4 year recruitment phase, 47 foetuses with echogenic kidneys were seen in the Foetal Medicine Unit (19 with macrocysts). Twenty (10F, current age 5-9 years) of the 29 live births (7 with macrocysts) were included in this study (data unavailable in 9). Six died in infancy (3 PKD, 2 bilateral MCDK, 1 congenital nephrotic syndrome). Survivors were followed up for at least 5 years. Eight remained normotensive with normal renal function, 5 had renal impairment (3 ARPKD, 2 CDK) -two were also hypertensive. Three of the 4 with ADPKD had family history of PKD. Conclusions: The postnatal outcome of antenatally diagnosed echogenic kidneys is variable. The morbidity in survivors beyond the neonatal period is signifi cant, with high incidence of hypertension and/ or severe renal impairment on 5 years' follow up. Long term studies with larger numbers are required to further delineate the prognosis.",

Objectives: In the last 48 months, the Coast Provincial General Hospital (CPGH) in Mombasa admitted about 18,000 patients in the department of paediatrics. Some of these admissions were congenital disorders. Prune Belly syndrome is a congenital disorder defi ned by a characteristic clinical triad; urinary tract abnormalities, abdominal muscle deficiency and bilateral cryptorchidism. Prognosis is quite favourable for the less severe types, best management is to do nothing surgically. Prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated for the urinary stasis. Methods: Retrospective audit of the last two years (48 months) looking for patients that fi t the clinical criteria of prune belly syndrome and describe their clinical characteristics. Results: Five patients fi tting the criteria of prune belly syndrome were identifi ed. Age at presentation ranged from one day to 60 months. Three of the patients were identifi ed at the neonatal unit having been admitted after birth for abdominal wall defects. The remaining two were admitted to the general Paediatric ward, one with sepsis and the other severe malnutrition. One of the patients had other anomalies; a patent urachus and skeletal anomalies. Echocardiography was not done in any of the patients, as all patients were haemodynamically stable and also because of fi nancial constraints Average creatinine at presentation was 139ummol/l (range 40\u00b5mol/l -420\u00b5mol/l) Two of the patients are lost to follow up. Two have been referred to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) for surgically intervention because of gradually deteriorating renal function and one to the surgical team locally. Conclusions: Prune belly syndrome appears to be a fairy common abnormality locally compared to international statistics of 1 in 35,000 to 1 in 50,000.",

Medina, 1 A.M. 3 Objectives: To determine the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of 13 colombian families with Bartter and Gitelman's syndrome. Methods: 13 colombian families were phenotypically characterized. 2 SNPs were typed in 6 genes (KCNJ1, SLC12A1, SLC12A3, BSDN, CASR, CLCNKB) previously associated with the syndrome. Association, linkage and haplotype analyses were applied. Results: 17 patients were analyzed. 47% with Gitelman's, 47% with neonatal Bartter's and 6% with classical Bartter. 38% of the children were consanguineous. Average age at diagnosis was: Neonatal Bartter 18.4 mo, classical Bartter 9.6 y and Gitelman 15.5 y. Main clinical symptoms were: polyhydramnios, preterm delivery, polyurea and hydroelectrolytic disturbances. All of the patients presented with hypokalemia and required treatment. Nephrocalcinosis was found in 33% of the patients with classical Bartter, 66% with neonatal Bartter. It was found association to two SNPs in KCNJ1 (p=0.0186). Haplotype analysis did increase the signifi cance of association (p=0.007). This gene has been previously reported as associated with type II Bartter. In addition two sibs with Gitelman's presented clear inheritance implicating the SLC12A3. Conclusions: This is the fi rst study in Colombia looking for a genetic component of Bartter and Gitelman's syndrome. It is remarkable that only association to KCNJ1 was found. It may correspond to phenotypic variability. Sequence analysis of both KCNJ1 and SLC12A3 genes is underway.",

Silveira, 2 L.R. Moura, 1 F.F. Santos, 1 J.M. Oliveira, 1 F.F. Carvalho, 1 M.M. Teixeira, 2 A.C. Simoes e Silva, 1 E.A. Oliveira. 1 1 Pediatrics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil; 2 Biochemistry and Immunology, Federal University of Minas, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Objectives: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify noninvasive biomarkers of clinically significant uropathies in patients with antenatal hydronephrosis. Methods: We have evaluated spot-urine levels of interleukin-6(IL-6), transforming growth factor-\u03b21(TGF-\u03b21) and tumoral necrosis factor-\u03b1(TNF-\u03b1) of 100 patients with intra-uterine hydronephrosis. Patients were divided into three groups: idiopathic renal pelvic dilatation (n=47), uropathies (n=35), and dysplastic kidneys (n=18). Results: The most frequent uropathies were ureteropelvic junction obstruction (n=13) and vesicoureteral refl ux (n=11). Dysplastic kidneys included multicystic dysplasia (n=14) and hypodysplasia (n=4). No signifi cant differences of urinary TGF-\u03b21, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were found in the comparison between the groups. Of 100 patients, 29 presented a reduction in DMSA uptake at the fi rst renal scintigraphy. Both absolute urinary concentration of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b21 levels standardized to urinary creatinine presented signifi cant elevation in patients with reduced DMSA uptake in comparison to those with normal DMSA (p<0.05). Urinary concentrations of IL6 and TNF-\u03b1 did not differ in the comparison between these groups. Conclusions: Although urinary cytokine measurements seemed not to be useful as screening test for clinically signifi cant uropathies, increased concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 pointed out to renal damage. Objectives: Current consensus is that unilateral MCDK is a benign condition with few patients suffering complications of urinary tract infection, proteinuria, hypertension or malignant transformation. Long-term follow-up has shown the persistence of the MCDK in some patients. We studied whether this was related to initial size of the MCDK. We also examined whether patients could be discharged if involution had occurred by 5 yrs. Methods: Data were retrieved from a prospective regional registry of patients with MCDK between 1985 and 2009. Children were followed using a common protocol of investigation with follow up clinical assessments and ultrasound scans (USS) at 2, 5 and 10 years. Results: Of 323 initial patients 249 had USS at 2 years, 180 at 5, 94 at 10 and 17 at 15 years follow up. Survival analysis of MCDK kidneys >5cm at birth showed persistence on USS at 10 years in 85% compared to 40% in those where the initial kidney size was <5cm (p < 0.0001).Of 180 patients followed to 5 yrs, 126 demonstrated compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney and 59 of the 126 were associated with complete involution of the MCDK. 20 of the 59 had been followed for 10 yrs with a mean eGFR of 88ml/min/1.73m 2 (range 46-108). None of the patients have had hypertension, signifi cant proteinuria or developed malignancy. Conclusions: MCDK kidneys are less likely to involute if they are large at birth. However the clinical progress appears to be benign and conservative management is justifi ed. The data would suggest that up to 1/3 of patients could be discharged at 5 yrs with compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney in association with involution of the MCDK and benign clinical status. Objectives: To describe prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and epidemiology of multicystic kidney dysplasia (MCKD) in Europe. Methods: Data from a large European database for surveillance of congenital malformations (EUROCAT). The registries are based on multiple sources of information including live births, fetal deaths, terminations of pregnancy, prenatal diagnosis and gestational age at diagnosis. Included were all cases form 20 registries with MCKD born in 1997-2004. Results: There were 1206 cases with MCKD, giving an overall prevalence of 3,78 per 10.000 births, with an increasing trend over the period. Among all cases there were 698 male (58 %) and 471 female (39%). Similar sex distribution were seen when cases were divided into uni-and bilateral MCKD. The majority of cases were unilateral (76%) and of these most were live born (84 %) and had isolated renal malformation (79%). Of the bilateral MCKD the majority of the pregnancies were terminated (61%) and only half had isolated renal malformation (52%). Time of diagnosis were prenatal for 1087 cases (87%) and the prenatal detection rate for all registries together were high (81-93%) with no trend seen over the years. There were a large regional difference in both prevalence (0,2 -9,5 per 10.000) and in prenatal diagnosis. Conclusions: Cases with unilateral MCKD were mainly live births, while pregnancies with bilateral cases often were terminated. There were large regional differences in prevalence in Europe. There seems to be an increasing prevalence of MCKD in Europe that cannot be explained by increasing prenatal detection rates.",

Methods: The study consisted of prospective data of 136 infants (27F, 109M) with antenatal hydronephrosis. Hydronephrosis was graded in accordance with the Society of Fetal Urology (SFU). Results: The mean follow up period was 18 months (min 6 month, max 3 years). Antenatal hydronephrosis was detected with the ultrasonographies performed in the second and third trimester in 80% and 20% of the patients, respectively. Only 10% of the patients had a family history of urinary tract disease. Grade 2 and 3 hydronephrosis were seen in 56% and 43% of the patients, respectively. Half of the patients (50%) had unilateral hydronephrosis. Vesicoureteral refl ux was detected in 14% of the patients. During the follow up antimicrobial prophylaxis was given to 36% of the study group. Urinary tract infection occured in 22% of the patients and renal scarring was observed in 8%. Surgical correction was performed in 10% of the patients. Conclusions: Antenatal hydronephrosis, which was more frequently seen in boys, has a low incidence of urinary tract infection. However, surgical correction although rarely, might be indicated. Non-invasive longterm postnatal follow up should be justifi ed in the majority of the patients.",

Objectives: Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) is a disease affecting many organ systems. Severe form of genetically confi rmed SIOD with unique features is presented. Methods: 3 year old girl with severe form of SIOD presented initially with growth failure, solitary kidney, nephrotic syndrome, T-cell immunodeffi ciency and characteristic physical features. Subsequently she developed hematologic abnormalities-rituximab resistant idiopatic trombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and central nervous system symptoms-reccurent transient ischemic attacks. To our current knowledge it is the fi rst described association of SIOD, unilateral renal agensis and rituximab resistant ITP. Results: Finally we analysed DNA and confi rmed mutations in SMARCAL 1 gene. The patient is compound heterozygous for mutations c.2542G>T (p. Glu848X) in exon 17 and c,1439>T (p.Pro480Leu) in exon 8. According to mutation type-nonsense, missense, the patient was expected to have milder form of SIOD. Genotype-fonotype variability in SIOD is apparent. Conclusions: SIOD affects many organ systems. Severe forms lead to death of patient in early childhood. Therapy of SIOD is only symptomatic. Our efforts to infl uence the course of SIOD associated ITP by rituximab and neurologic manifestations of this disease was unsuccessful. Molecular genetic testing can be done. Mutations our found in 50-60% of cases. Prenatal diagnosis is possible in these families. Objectives: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease in adulthood. Postnatal overnutrition following IUGR may be of pathogenic importance for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to identify the possible pathogenesis of kidney disease in IUGR and the effect of postnatal overnutrition by comparative proteomic approach. Methods: IUGR was induced in rats by isocaloric protein restriction in pregnant dams. IUGR pups were divided into two groups, fed either standard-protein diet (IUGR group) or high-protein diet (HP group). At the age of 12 weeks, kidney proteins were obtained from each group. 2-DE, staining, mass spectrometry and database searching were used. Results: The differential proteomic expression analysis between IUGR and control group found 12 proteins had signifi cantly differential expressions, which were transcription regulators including prohibitin and ribonuclease UK114, structural molecules including capping protein, enzymes and so on. Subsequently, the differential proteomic expression analysis between IUGR and HP group found 16 proteins had signifi cantly differential expressions, which were transcription regulators including ribonuclease UK114 and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, structural molecules including ezrin and gamma-actin, enzymes and so on. Conclusions: Data from this study may provide, at least partly, valuable experimental evidence of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of kidney disease in IUGR and the effect of postnatal overnutrition.

Objectives: AKI is a strong predictor of mortality in VLBW infants. Novel urine biomarkers of AKI predict mortality in other populations. We evaluate the utility of 6 biomakers to predict mortality in VLBW infants. Methods: Urine samples were collected on postnatal days 1 through 6 for 105 VLBW infants in whom 13 died at (age 26 +/-6 days). The maximum concentration for each biomarker was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), interleukin 18 (IL-18) and osteopontin (OPN) levels were higher in non-survivors vs. survivors, while cystatin C and B2 Microglobulin (B2 Mgb) were not statistically different. Objectives: AKI is a strong predictor of mortality in VLBW infants (birthweight 500-1500g) Novel urine biomarkers predict AKI in others. We evaluate the utility of 6 urine biomarkers to predict AKI in VLBW infants. Methods: Urine samples were collected on postnatal days 1 through 6 in 78 VLBW infants. Maximum concentration for each biomarker was determined. AKI is defi ned as a rise in serum creatinine (SCr) by 0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours or SCr rise by > 50% at any time.",

Methods: Rat kidneys were collected at birthP0,4,7,14, 21 for mRNA expression of AQP1-9,11,and12 using PCR. Gender differences were determined at P14,P21. Results: Compared to P0, AQP1, 4, and 5 were robustly expressed at birth and increased with advancing age from 24fold, 52fold, and 19fold at P4, respectively, to 300fold at P21 for AQP1 and 5. AQP4 peaked at P14, declined at P21. At P14, AQP1 expression was 30% less in males, but by P21, no differences were seen. AQP2 was expressed at birth but progressively increased until P14, then declined at P21. AQP3 was consistently elevated from birth to P21, but highest expression was P7. AQP6 was expressed at birth and P4, but was not seen at P7 to 21. AQP7, 9, and 12 mRNA expression was present at birth, did not change with age. AQP8 was not present at birth and P4, mildly expressed at P7 to 21. AQP11 was not detected. Conclusions: AQP1,2,4, and 5 mRNA are expressed at birth but gene expression dramatically increases during suckling in rats, crucial for water homeostasis during kidney development. Data emphasize importance of lactation for kidney development and function.

Pediatrics, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. Objectives: Due to successful neonatal care, survival of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates continues to increase. Recent data showed that very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates are at high risk of acute renal failure, however data on renal function of ELBWgroup is scare. Furthermore, serum creatinine (Scr) remains a widely used clinical tool to estimate GFR, however normal values in this population are not yet defi ned. We aim to assess Scr of this group and defi ne predictors of renal impairment. Methods: Retrospective chart review of ELBWneonates assessed in a single centre between 2000-2005. Neonates with congenital renal abnormalities and/ or death \u22647 days were excluded. Neonatal Scr (mg/dl) was analysed according to prenatal, peripartal and postnatal variables. Results are described as median (range). Results: In 151 ELBW (66 females), gestational age(GA) at birth was 27 (23-33)w, birthweight(BW) was 810 (330-1000)g with 34% SGA. Peak Scr level was reached on day 3:1.3 (0. 4-2.5) . We defi ned severe renal impairment as peak Scr on day 3>75 th percentile. Thirty seven (24.5%) neonates had severe renal impairment. Their Scr remains higher on day 14 and 28 (p<0.001).They had lower BW, lower GA, more ibuprofen and steroid exposure and longer ventilation period. Multivariate analysis confi rmed that GA and ventilation period (p<0.0001) were signifi cant risks factors, while SGA was not (p=0.17). Conclusions: ELBW neonates are at risk for severe renal impairment in the neonatal period with similar risks factors as the VLBW peers. Our data showed that peak Scr on day 3 was a good predictor for renal impairment in this weight category. Prospective studies for long term renal function of this group are needed.",

Therefore, pathogenic antibodies (i.e. directed against angiotensine II receptor type 1) (AT1R-AA) could have an impact in neonates. It has been reported that blood in neonates less than 1350g of birth weight and 29 SG and born from preeclamptic mothers, blood pressure was signifi cantly higher than in controls (neonates born from normotensive mothers). We conducted a retrospective study in premature newborn -older than 29SG and with a weight higher than 1350g -in order to compare blood pressure levels whether their mother presented with preeclampsia or not. Methods: Blood pressure levels of 24 premature newborns from preeclamptic mothers and their matched controls were retrospectively studied and compared during their fi rst three days of life. Results: Mean gestational age (31.1 vs. 31.2 SG) and birth weight (1774 vs. 1865g) were not different between the two groups. The only difference was the delivery mode with more caesarian section in the preeclampsia group. Diastolic blood pressure was signifi cantly higher in the preeclampsia group of newborn than in the control group (mean difference: + 3.13 mmHg, p<0.05). No difference was present between the two groups considering systolic or mean blood pressure. Conclusions: Even if not clinically relevant, these data seem to confi rm that newborns from preeclamptic mothers are susceptible to have higher blood pressures than newborns from normotensive mothers. This difference could be explained by the transplacental transfer of AT1R-AA to fetuses. Objectives: There is limited data on anatomic & functional renal development in growth restricted neonates.We compared glomerular function on day 3 in appropriate for date (AFD) & small for date (SFD) neonates.Glomerular,tubular functions & renal volumes were also assessed in fi rst 6-wks. Methods: After consents, 103 neonates (32-41 wk gestation) delivered at this center included. Serum creatinine, cystatin, Schwartz GFR, urine osmolality & fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), potassium (FEK) measured starting from 12-24 hr of life until 6 wk. Renal volume assessed by ultrasonography at 2-4 wk after birth. Results: No signifi cant difference in serum creatinine (mg/dl) observed in preterm AFD, term SFD& term AFD at day 3 (0.85\u00b10.3, 0.80\u00b1 0.3 & 0.82\u00b10.2 respectively, P=0.9). In each group, GFR correlated positively to postnatal age (P<0.01).Levels of cystatin did not change (P=0.8) while urine osmolality rose with postnatal age (P<0.001).On multivariate analysis, smaller kidney volume correlated signifi cantly with prematurity and low weight for gestational age. Conclusions: Renal function and volume in preterm AFD and term SFD babies is compromised. Follow up studies are required to determine implications on long term renal outcome.",

Methods: Patients with antenatal hydronephrosis were evaluated by serial postnatal USG (2 nd week, 3-6-12-24 months) and, if needed, dynamic renal scintigraphy and/or voiding cystourethrography. Each renal unit (RU) was classifi ed as normal, non-obstructive dilatation, obstructive uropathy or VUR. The predictive powers of antenatal and postnatal 2nd week USG for obstructive uropathy \u00b1 VUR were determined according to these data. Results: Evaluations were performed on 92 patients (184 RU) having both antenatal USG (hydronephrosis in 120 RU) and postnatal USG (hydronephrosis in 113 RU). The diagnoses of RU with vs without hydronephrosis in antenatal USG were normal (1 vs 48), non-obstructive dilatation (70 vs 12), obstructive uropathy (33 vs 2) and VUR (16 vs 2), respectively (p<0.001) (OR 10, sensitivity 93%, specifi city 46%, PPV 41%, NPV 94% for obstructive uropathy \u00b1 VUR). The diagnoses of RU with vs without hydronephrosis in postnatal USG were normal (8 vs 41), non-obstructive dilatation (59 vs 23), obstructive uropathy (33 vs 2) and VUR (13 vs 5), respectively (p<0.001) (OR 6, sensitivity 87%, specifi city 49%, PPV 41%, NPV 90% for obstructive uropathy \u00b1 VUR). Conclusions: Antenatal and postnatal 2 nd week USG were sensitive but not specifi c for the prediction of signifi cant hydronephrosis. Furthermore, presence of hydronephrosis in antenatal or postnatal USG did not differ with regard to the prediction of fi nal diagnosis.",

Kemper. 1,2 1 Pediatric Nephrology, Universitiy Children's Hospital, Hamburg, Germany; 2 Pediatric Nephrology, University Children's Hospital, Zuerich, Switzerland. Objectives: Prognosis of ROH has been regarded as unfavorable, although clinical data are scarce. Due to progress in neonatal intensive care and the treatment of infants with chronic kidney disease, the overall prognosis of these children has improved considerably. The aim of this study was the evaluation of complications and longterm follow-up in patients with ROH. Methods: Data on 39 fetuses (26 male, 13 female) with ROH from 1990 to 2010 were evaluated. Results: Primary diseases included urinary tract malformations (n=26), ARPKD and ADPKD (n=9) and other (n=4). Of 9 non-survivors (23%), 6 died within the neonatal period. 27 patients required mechanical ventilation (16 with associated pneumothorax). The surviving 30 children have a current median age of 5.6 (0,1-16) years. All developed CKD, which could be managed conservatively in 14 patients (median GFR 50.1 (range 19.9-130) ml/min/1.73m\u00b2). 16 patients reached ESRD at a median age of 3 months (range 2 days to 8.2 years); two received a preemptive kidney transplantation (KT), and 14 started peritoneal dialysis. 11 of these patients underwent successful KT at a median age of 3.1 (range 1.1-12) years. Two of them had a combined hepatorenal transplantation due to ARPKD. Cognitive and motor development was normal in 25 of 30 patients (83%) and showed a delay in 5 children. Conclusions: In ROH long-term prognosis is encouraging and range from CKD stage 1 to combined hepatorenal transplantation. The rate of perinatal problems and complications is high and may increase, since more severely affected fetuses are actively treated.",

Pediatric Nephrology, Erciyes University Medical Faculty, Kayseri, Turkey. Objectives: We aimed to determine the etiological reasons and frequency of prenatal determined hydronephrosis, and to evaluate the association between some parameters and renal functions during study. Methods: Forty-eigth patients born between April 2006-October 2007 with prenatal hydronephrosis were followed prospectively. The urinary ultrasound scan and renal functioning tests were performed on day 3-7 of life and repeated on week 4-6, months 3, 6 and 12. Results: In 29.3% of all 76 renal units with prenatal hydronephrosis, transient hydronephrosis was diagnosed. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction was the most common cause of prenatal hydronephrosis. Thirty-two patients (66.6%) had urinary tract infection during study. Eshericia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infection. There were negative correlations between GFR of at the end of study and fractione K + excretion at the 3 th month and 1 st year. There were negative correlations between GFR of at the end of study and fractione Mg ++ excretion at the 3 th and 6 th months. There were positive correlation between GFR of at the end of study and tubular reabsorbtion of phosphate 1 st year and negative correlation between GFR of at the end of study and serum BUN and creatinine levels 1 st year. Only one patient had stage 2 chronic renal disease at the end of study. Conclusions: Transient hydronephrosis is one of the most important reasons of prenatal hydronephrosis. Tubular functioning tests may be impaired early stages. The patients with prenatal hydronephrosis must be followed-up closely and the episodic evaluation of tubular functions may predict renal damage before renal failure development. Objectives: Various nanoparticles are produced with development of nanotechnology. The safety is not confi rmed precisely at present. We have already reported that some nanoparticles exposure to pregnancy animal exert severe damages on nervous and respiratory systems of offspring. In this study, the infl uence of exposure to ultrafi ne carbon black (UfCB) in fetal period on renal system of offspring was examined morphologically. Methods: Pregnant ICR mice were exposed to a total of 100 \u00b5g of UfCB (particle size; 14nm) by intranasal instillation on gestational days 5 and 9 for exposure group (CB group); comparative control animals were treated with vehicle. After delivered their pups, kidney tissues were collected from 12-week-old male pups, and examined with light and electron microscope. All experimental animals were handled in accordance with institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Results: In renal cortex of CB group, collagen fi bers were diffusely observed surroundings of renal corpuscle and tubule, and signifi cantly larger than in control group. In addition, specifi c and interesting renal failure, that is similar to characteristic fi ndings in a part of genetics diseases, were found in tubular epithelial cell of renal cortex of CB group. Conclusions: These observations indicate that perinatally-exposed ultrafi ne carbon black caused renal failure in offspring. Our fi ndings indicate existence of a severe health hazard to infants borne from mothers exposed nanomaterials during pregnancy. It is possible that these inborn damages carry a severe disorder, which is recognized as a genetic disorder. Objectives: The study was done to fi nd out any relationship between maternal BMI with kidney length and volume of term neonate. Methods: Fifty eight (58) healthy, term, appropriate for gestational age (37 to 41 wks) newborn were examined prospectively by sonography within 72 hours of birth by a single sonologist. In 30 boys and 28 girls, body weight(BW), supine length(SL) and occipitofrontal circumference(OFC) were collected from delivery room records. Maternal BMI was calculated by the formula BMI=wt in kg.ht 2 in meter.Scanning was performed with 6.5 MHZ transducer. Maximum length of each kidney was determined. Volume of the kidneys were determined by in built formula of software. Kidney length and kidney volume were then correlated with maternal BMI. This two were also correlated with different parameters of newborn. Results: There were no signifi cant differences in mean kidney length and volume between right (38.41mm, 9.67cc) and left (38.43mm, 9.79cc) kidney. The length of kidneys between boys and girls showed no difference, but volume of right kidney between boys and girls showed signifi cant difference (<0.01). Kidney length (KL) was correlated better with infant BMI (<0.01), infant body weight (<0.01) than infant body surface area (BSA) (<0.05).Kidney volume was also correlated with BMI (<0.05).body weight (<0.05) and BSA (<0.05). But kidney length and volume showed no signifi cant correlation with maternal BMI. Conclusions: Despite expectation that maternal BMI might have some correlation with neonatal kidney size but our study showed no signifi cant correlation with maternal BMI.",

Conclusions: The present ongoing study provides an important baseline data in preterm babies for kidney dimension in Bangladeshi neonate as well as neonate of Indian subcontinent. BW, BMI, BSA all are correlated with kidney length and volume. So other two along with BW can also be selected as the independent variable for preparation of normogram for kidney length and Volume in premature infant. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of total parenteral nutrition on renal functions of prematrue infants by comparing the serum cystatin C (cysC) levels and urinary N-acetyl-\u03b2-D glucosaminidase (NAG), \u03b2 2 microglobulin (\u03b22M), gluthatione S transferase (GST) \u03c0 levels in premature infants receiving total parenteral nutrition or enteral feding. Methods: Premature infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care unit of Inonu University between January 2007 and July 2008, with a gestational age of 28 and 34 weeks were included in the study. Exclusion criteria consisted of presence of congenital malformations, parental refusal, onset of TPN or death prior to 72 hours. Prenatal, natal and postnatal characteristics of infants including the presence of respiratory distress syndrome, early neonatal sepsis, late-onset neonatal sepsis and the use of aminoglycosides were recorded. on the 3 rd and 30 th day of life, blood samples of all patients were obtained for evaluating biochemical parameters and cysC, and urine samples for the evaluation of NAG, GST \u03c0, \u03b22M, sodium, creatinin levels, density and pH of the urine. Results: Serum cysS, urinary \u03b22M, NAG and GST \u03c0 excretion were signifi cantly higher in samples of patients receiving TPN both on 3 rd and 30 th days (p<0.05 for each parameter on each day). Conclusions: This study have shown for the 1 st time in premature infants that, TPN together with the presence of sepsis and use of aminoglycosides can have adverse effects on glomerular and tubular functions of the kidney which can be manifested with cysC, \u03b22M, NAG and GST \u03c0.",

Objectives: Inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene that encodes the thiazidesensitive co-transporter cause Gitelman syndrome whose features include normal-low blood pressure, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, and hyperreninemia. These patients are at low risk for preterm birth and the condition is usually diagnosed in childhood or in adult life. We report on 4 patients, 2 pairs of prematurely born twins, in whom hypokalemia was demonstrated early in life. Methods: We evaluated 2 pairs of twins born after 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. In the 4 children, hypokalemia was noted during the third week of life, associated with normal blood pressure, normal total plasma magnesium level, hypochloremia and hyperreninemia. A marginal tendency towards hypomagnesemia (0.70 mmol/L) was observed after 2 years of life. Results: In both pairs of twins we demonstrated compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC12A3 gene: a frame shift mutation in exon 10 (c.1196_1202dup7bp), leading to the truncated protein p.Ser402X, and a missense mutation in exon 11, p.Ser475Cys (c.1424C>G) were disclosed in the fi rst pair and two missense mutations, p.Thr392Ile (c.1175C>T) in exon 9 and p.Ser615Leu in exon 15 (c.1844C>T), in the second pair. Conclusions: Gitelman syndrome may be considered as an additional cause of hypokalemia in the neonatal period. Objectives: We examined ontogeny of renal arachidonic acid(AA) metabolites and gene expression of CYPs during renal maturation in newborn,suckling and weanling periods in neonatal rats. We determined gender differences in CYP enzymes. Methods: Kidneys from rat pups were examined at birth P0,P4,P7,P14,P21 for levels of PGE2,PGF2,6-ketoPGF1,thromboxane(Tx) B2,8-isoPGF2,leukotriene (LKT) B4, and (15-HETE) using ELISA, and the gene expression of CYPs using PCR. Results: All AA metabolites were high at birth(PGE2:412611;PGF2:44298;6-ketoPGF1: 47196;TxB2:350548;8-isoPGF2:1181725;LKTB4:59983114;and 15-HETE: 41026109. During low Na suckling, metabolites exhibited different maturation. All decreased by(%)90,40,95,100,98,100; p<0.01,respectively,except TxB2 3390609, which declined at P7(46145) and P14(12248) compared to P0. At high Na weaning, metabolites increased with vasoconstrictors,TxB2(1364.09),8-isoPGF2(126545859), and 15-HETE(3063165) being highest. Ontogenic patterns of CYP enzymes paralleled metabolites. The main renal isoform of CYP3A regulates BP and R-A system, downregulated during suckling, and upregulated during weaning, 5-fold higher in females than males. Conclusions: Renal AA metabolites favor vasoconstrictors at weaning and may be important for drug disposition/Na excretion. Higher expression of CYP3A5 in females has early gender-specifi c difference.",

Stimulation of RhoA activity that in turn reduced NHE1 expression was demonstrated in 14 day Losartan UUO kidney.Interaction between NHE1 and pERK was determined by coimmunoprecipitation showing that membrane downregulation of NHE1 was associated with pERK overexpression. Absence of increased AT2 protein expression after Losartan on day 14 of obstruction was shown. PD-123319 had no protective effect on the renal response to complete 14 day UUO. Conclusions: Our fi ndings suggest a role of RhoA on the negative regulation of NHE1 inducing phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 as events involved in tubular cell apoptosis regulation after AT1 receptor inhibition in neonatal UUO. Objectives: Hypertension and chronic kidney disease in the adulthood are related to prenatal insults that usually result in low birth weight and reduced nephron number. In animals, maternal nutrient restriction produces offspring with fewer nephrons. We studied whether the reduced nephron number is due to the inhibition of ureteric branching and developmentally regulated signaling pathways. Methods: The offspring of dams given food ad libitum (CON) and those subjected to 50% food restriction throughout pregnancy (NR) were examined. Embryonic day 13 (E13) to day 15 (E15) metanephroi were stained with Dolichos bifl ous lectin. Lysates of E15 metanephroi were analyzed by immunoblot. Results: At E13, there was no difference between NR and CON in either body weight or kidney surface area. Ureteric buds branched once in both NR and CON. At E14 and E15, body weight and kidney surface area were signifi cantly reduced in NR compared with CON. Ureteric bud tip numbers per kidney were signifi cantly reduced in NR (11.2\u00b11.3 vs 21.3\u00b11.0 at E14 and 31.0\u00b11.7 vs 59.6\u00b13.5 at E15). Activated forms of ERK, p38, PI3-kinase, and Akt and protein expression of \u03b2 catenin were decreased 0.6-, 0.8-, 0.7-, 0.5-, and 0.7-fold, respectively, in NR. The expression of PCNA, a marker of proliferation, was not different between NR and CON, whereas that of cleaved caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis, was markedly decreased (0.4-fold of CON). Conclusions: Ureteric branching and metanephros growth were inhibited by maternal nutrient restriction after E13. Downregulation of developmentally regulated signaling pathways may play a role in abnormal kidney development in this pathophysiological setting.",

We reported hypomagnesaemia in children with HNF1B mutations and found that, in vitro, HNF1B transactivated FXYD2 encoding a distal convoluted tubule (DCT) Na + K + ATPase subunit itself mutated in another inherited hypomagnesaemia. However, whether HNF1B protein exists in DCT is unknown and we accordingly investigated expression of this and fxyd2 in mouse kidneys. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and western blotting in adult mouse kidneys and an established DCT cell line. Results: In tissue sections, hnf1b transcription factor was immunodetected in nuclei of kidney epithelia, being most prominent in collecting ducts and distal tubules, the latter characterised by expression of the transporter slc12a3. Hnf1b was weakly expressed in proximal tubules but glomerular epithelia, interstitial and vascular cells were negative. Fxyd2 itself had an overlapping distribution with hnf1b, being expressed in the distal tubule and collecting ducts. The DCT cell line expressed hnf1b as assessed by western blotting. Conclusions: Hnf1b and fxyd2 co-expression in distal tubules support the hypothesis that HNF1B mutations cause magnesium wasting by altering DCT physiology. Interestingly, expression of hnf1b in proximal tubules is consistent with a role in uric acid handling, as hyperuricaemia can be part of the syndrome.",

FAK, ILK, paxillin and Hic-5 are major proteins to contribute these signaling events. We investigated the expression of these proteins in developing kidneys. Methods: We performed western blotting and immunohistochemistry in rat developing kidneys which removed from embryos on day 14 to 18 of gestation, and on 1 to 42 days after birth. Results: Western blotting revealed that the expression of FAK (p-FAK 397 ), paxillin (p-paxillin 118 ) and Hic-5 were high in embryonic kidneys. Meanwhile, ILK expression retain from embryonic to matured kidney. Immunohistochemistry revealed that FAK and paxillin were strongly expressed in mesenchymal cells and ureteric bud, following detected in elongating tubular epithelial cells, collecting duct, immature glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells. Compared with distribution of PCNA positive cells, FAK and paxillin might be involved in renal growth and morphogenesis. Hic-5 was dominantly expressed in mesenchymal and immature glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells, similar to \u03b1-SMA positive cells, suggesting that Hic-5 might be related to mesenchymal cell behavior. In mature kidneys, FAK and paxillin were limited in tubules and Hic-5 was limited in vascular smooth muscle cells. Although ILK expression similar to FAK in developing stages, it strongly expressed at matured podocytes and tubules. It suggests that ILK plays a role in epithelial cell differentiation as well as kidney growth and morphogenesis. Conclusions: Temporo-spatially regulated expression of FAs might play a role in kidney morphogenesis and differentiation.",

It is important for the study on pathogenesis of podocyte injury as well as mechanism of proteinuria. This study aimed to establish a stable technique to test TRPC6 not only the expression level but also the electrophysiology in podocytes. Methods: The protein expression of over-expression TRPC6 was evaluated with western blot. The intracellular Ca 2+ in podocyte was measured by laser scanning confocal microscope. The current recording was utilized in the whole-cell mode to detect the channel function of over-expression TRPC6. Results: Exposure of the podocyte to carbachol (CCh) and/or 1-oleoyl-acetyl-snglycerol (OAG) after initiating whole-cell dialysis via the patch pipette, caused a time-dependent activation of membrane current. The current density increased dramatically in over-expression group than in control by using CCh and OAG (P<0.05). After inhibiting the TRPC6 ion channel by treated with U73122, the current density was decreased in both over-expression TRPC6 group and control group (P>0.05). Conclusions: Functional changes of TRPC6 were detected for the fi rst time in podocytes of MPC5. It was found that TRPC6 ion channel could be activated excessively with increasing of Ca 2+ concentration via over-expression of TRPC6 in cultured podocytes, which might provide a cell model for further study on TRPC6 ion channel in podocytes.",

Baylis. 2 1 1st Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; 2 Department of Physiology and Functional Genomics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States. Objectives: In pregnancy, systemic vasodilation results in renal Na and water retention and consequent PVE. Previously we showed that increased renal phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) activity inhibits the natriuretic response, contributing to the PVE in pregnancy. Methods: To test the \"underfi ll hypothesis\" of pregnancy, we produced chronic vasodilation by 14 days po. nifedipine (NIF, 10 mg/kg/day) or sodium nitrite (NaNO2, 70 mg/kg/day) to female Sprague Dawley rats vs those on control diet (CON). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was monitored by telemetry, PV was determined by the Evans-blue method, hematocrit (Hct), osmolarity (Posm), Na (PNa), and total protein (CA) concentrations were also measured. mRNA expression and protein abundance of PDE5A and its isoforms were determined in kidney and aorta. Results: MAP was reduced in NIF by 6.7%, in NaNO2 rats by 7.6% vs. baseline and CON (p<0.05). NIF and NaNO2 lowered Hct and increased PV. Posm and PNa both fell, as did CA (*p<0.05 vs. CON).Renal medullary PDE5A and PDE5A1 mRNA expression increased both in NIF and NaNO2 group vs CON (p<0.05), while PDE5A2 isoform was the same in all groups. PDE5A protein level increased both in NIF and NaNO2 vs CON (p<0.05), however, neither renal cortical nor aortic PDE5 level was changed by vasodilator treatment. Conclusions: A primary vasodilation produced by NIF or NaNO2 drives increased medullary PDE5 expression, renal Na retention causing volume expansion and partial \"refi lling\" of the vasculature. These responses closely resemble the changes in normal pregnancy with hemodilution due to marked PVE. DISCLOSURE: Baylis, C.: Other, Forrest Pharma. Objectives: We investigated whether glomerular can express ANGPTL3 and whether ANGPTL3 can directly or indirectly bind to integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 in podocytes. Methods: We studied normal and MCD kidneys from humans and rats to evaluate the location and sub cellular features of ANGPTL3 in the podocytes. Using ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR, we evaluated ANGPTL3 produced by cultured podocytes. And we evaluated the bind model of ANGPTL3 and integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 in podocytes by confocal microscopy and immuno-precipitation. Results: Our results showed that ANGPTL3 were specially localized to the podocyte foot processes in glomerular. Quantitative analysis revealed a signifi cantly higher concentration of colloid-gold particles in the nephrotic podocytes compared to normal podocytes (P<0.05). Results of ELISA and real-time PCR suggested that the ability of cultured podocytes to synthesize ANGPTL3, which was greatly enhanced after ADR treatment. ANGPTL3 could directly bind to integrin \u03b23. The active integrin \u03b23 expression was signifi cantly up-regulated in podocytes over-expressing ANGPLT3 compared with control cells (P<0.01). Compared with an un-knockdown ANGPTL3 podocyte, ANGPTL3 knockdown cell did not show signifi cant the active integrin \u03b23 upregulation after ADR-stimulation, suggesting that ANGPTL3 could regulate integrin \u03b23 expression under certain pathological conditions. Conclusions: It is fi rst report to demonstrate that ANGPTL3 is found mainly within the foot processes of podocyte. And ANGPTL3 is a new key ligand that induces integrin \u03b23 activation in podocytes.",

Department of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Objectives: Chinese medicine Extractum trametes robiniophila murr is a kind of fungus. Recent study has suggested that it could be capable to effi ciently improve the effacement of foot process in Adriamycin (ADR) induced rats. The aim of this study was to identify whether Extractum trametes robiniophila murr modulates actin rearrangement of podocytes and signaling molecules such as ACTN4, nephrin and podocin. Methods: The podocytes were divided into four groups as follows: Extractum trametes robiniophila murr group (Extractum trametes robiniophila murr 10mg/ ml + ADR 0.5umol/L); DXM group (DXM 0.1umol/L + ADR 0.5umol/L); ADR group (ADR 0.5umol/L) and control group. F-actin of podocytes in each group were stained by fl uorescent phallotoxins of invitrogen and observed by confocal microscope. The expression levels of ACTN4, nephrin and podocin in each group were tested by real-time PCR and western blot. Results: ADR group had signifi cant actin rearrangement. However, in Extractum trametes robiniophila murr group, podocytes showed a more powerful resistance to actin rearrangement of ADR induction than DXM group. In ADR group, the expression levels of ACTN4, nephrin and podocin were signifi cantly higher than those in control group. The expression level of ACTN4 in Extractum trametes robiniophila murr group was almost same as that in control group, while in DXM group, the expression level of ACTN4 was higher than that in control group. Extractum trametes robiniophila murr could not regulate the altering expression of nephrin and podocin after ADR treatment. Conclusions: Extractum trametes robiniophila murr is a powerfully potential modulator to actin rearrangement of podocytes. Objectives: To investigate effects of PHB on cell growth and ECM expression induced by TGF-\u03b21 in renal interstitial fi broblasts, and ascertain whether PHB can suppress TGF-\u03b21-mediated Smad signaling passway. Methods: Cell growth curves were detected. PHB, ECM proteins fi bronectin (Fn) and collagen type III (Col III), and matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP-1) protein and mRNA expression were detected. Phosphorylation and activation of Smad3 by TGF-\u03b21 and Smad7 expression were detected, and phosphorylation of Smad3 and its association with Smad4 in cells after TGF-\u03b21 stimulation were further investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. Results: Stimulation of cells with 1ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 induced a remarkable cells growth. Transfected with PHB plasmid suppressed cells growth, and the cell growth was 27%, 48% and 35% inhibited after transfection for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. TGF-\u03b21 induced Col III and Fn proteins and mRNA expression and the effects were dose-dependent. Over-expression of PHB substantially attenuated the up-regulation of Col III and Fn, although it had almost no effect on the up-regulation of MMP1 induced by TGF-\u03b21. Smad3 was phosphorylated after TGF-\u03b21 treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that p-Smad3 was physically associated with Smad4. However, Over-expression of PHB did not signifi cantly affect Smad3 phosphorylation and its association with Smad4. Conclusions: Extraneous PHB suppresses renal interstitial fi broblasts proliferation and ECM expression induced by TGF-\u03b21, and suppresses profi brotic cytokine TGF-\u03b21 by intercepting Smad3 nuclear translocation. Objectives: This study was to investigate molecular mechanism of RGC-32 gene regulation in TGF-beta-induced EMT. Methods: (1) Plasmid Construction;(2) RNA interference;(3) Transfection and luciferase activity assay;(4) EMSAs. Results: (1) TGF-beta1 can active RGC-32 gene expression driven by pLuc-1500, pLuc-2107, or pLuc+844, but not by pLuc-85, pLuc-228, pLuc-600, or pLuc-1021 (P<0.001) after treated by TGF-beta1. It is indicated binding site which involved TGF-beta1 has located at RGC-32 promoter region from -1021 to -1500. SBE (GTCTGGAC) is located at the site from -1344 to -1337 of RGC-32 promoter, as well as a PEA3 binding site (AGGAAG) align at 35bp upstream of SBE from -1379 to -1374. Mutation of Smad site signifi cantly inhibited RGC-32 promoter activity (P<0.01), double mutations of Smad and PEA3 sites completely abolished promoter activity. (2) Smad2, Smad4 and PEA3 proteins are contribute to regulation of TGF-beta-induced RGC-32 expression: Smad2 and Smad4 antibody shown the same degree of supershift, Smad2, Smad4 and PEA3 proteins are contribute to regulation of TGF-beta-induced RGC-32 promoter activity. Smad2 was essential for TGF-beta induction of RGC-32 promoter, knockdown of PEA3 alone did not signifi cantly inhibit RGC-32 promoter, but knockdown of both Smad2 and PEA3 completely blocked TGF-beta function. Conclusions: SBE and PEA3 binding site were found at the upstream of RGC-32 promoter. Smad2 and PEA3 synergistically regulate TGF-beta induction of RGC-32 transcription during EMT.",

We previously showed that unfolded protein response (UPR) caused by lack of ATP in the endoplasmic reticulum might underlie the pathomechanism of MCN. The purpose of this study was to further investigate whether ATP consuming signaling cascade, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), precedes UPR in MCN. Methods: Rat MCN was induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). Isolated glomeruli and kidney tissue from rats treated with or without mTOR inhibitor everolimus were subjected to immunohistochemistry, dual-immunofl uorescence and confocal microscopy, and Western blot analysis for mTORC1 and UPR phosphorylation. Immortalized mouse podocytes were treated with PAN in a time dependent manner, and subjected to Western blot analysis for mTORC1 and UPR phosphorylation. Results: Rats developed signifi cant proteinuria from day 2 after injection of PAN. Activation of both UPR and mTORC1 in glomerular podocytes was reveled at day 1 whereas expression of nephrin and podocin was reduced from day 2. Interestingly, mTORC1 activation was revealed to precede UPR when cultured podocytes were treated with PAN. Pre-treatment of everolimus at day 1 before PAN injection interfered with proteinuria compared with placebo-treated rats. The activation of both mTORC1 and UPR in the glomerular podocytes of rats treated with everolimus was decreased compared with placebo-rats. Conclusions: mTORC1 may be a potential signaling cascade that initiates UPR through dysregulation of energy system. Investigation of precise regulatory mechanism of ATP in podocytes may contribute to develop new therapeutic reagents for MCN. Objectives: Patients having the nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD) exhibit hyponatremia and inappropriate elevated urinary osmolality associated to low plasma vasopressin levels. All patients reported to date present either the R137C or R137L V2 mutated receptor. While the clinical features have been characterized, the molecular mechanisms of functioning of these two mutants remain elusive. In the present study, we compare the pharmacological properties of R137C and R137L mutants with the wild-type and the V2 D136A receptor, the latter being reported as a highly constitutively active receptor. Methods: We have performed binding studies, second messenger measurements and BRET experiments in order to evaluate the affi nities of V2 receptor ligands, their agonist and antagonist properties and the ability of the mutated receptors to recruit \u03b2-arrestins, respectively. Results: The R137C and R137L V2 receptors exhibit small constitutive activities regarding the G s protein activation. In addition, these two mutants induce a constitutive \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Of interest, they also exhibit weak sensitivities to V2 -agonist and to V2 -inverse agonist in term of G s protein coupling and \u03b2-arrestin recruitment.",

Objectives: Mizoribine (MZR) is an inhibitor of purine synthesis for an immunosuppressive agent. We empirically noted that the clinical effi cacy of MZR is relatively lower in pediatric patients compared with adults, but there have been few pediatric pharmacokinetic studies on MZR reported. Methods: One hundred and fi ve pediatric patients in our institutions were enrolled. The most frequent disease was idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in 74 patients, followed by secondary glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy. The single dose of MZR was 1-14 mg/kg. Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis was performed based on the blood MZR levels in the patients. Results: The mean absorption lag time and absorption rate constant estimated to be 0.501 h and 0.761 h -1 , respectively, showing that MZR slowly appeared in the circulation and blood level elevation was also slow compared to those in adults. Using the calculated PPK parameters, the AUC \u221e and C max were compared based on Bayes' theorem among individual patients. A signifi cant correlation was noted between the age and AUC \u221e (P<0.0001), and the C max was also signifi cantly different among the age groups (P<0.05). Based on these fi ndings, the required MZR dose per body weight increased as the age decreased. Conclusions: The regular dose of MZR (2-3 mg/kg/day) is insuffi cient for pediatric patients. To obtain the expected clinical effect, high-dose treatment should be applied using the MZR-PPK model established in this study.",

Objectives: To describe a child with hyponatremic seizures and apparent syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIADH), with a mutation in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene. Methods: A 13 month old previously healthy boy presented with a generalized tonic clonic seizure. On exam, the patient was post-ictal, euvolemic and normotensive. His only laboratory abnormality was a serum sodium of 122 mEq/L. Initially, he was treated with a normal saline infusion for 24 hours and serum sodium improved to 128 mEq/L. His intravenous fl uids were then held and he maintained hydration with oral fl uids. Twelve hours later, his serum sodium was 118 mEq/L. Concurrently, all other serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were normal. His fractional excretion of sodium was 1.2%, plasma and urine osmolalities were 252 and 392 mOsm/L respectively, anti-diuretic hormone level was 1.8 pg/ml (range:1-13.3), serum aldosterone was 13 ng/dl (range:2-37) and serum renin was <0.1 ng/ml/hr. Subsequently, he was successfully treated with mild fl uid restriction and table salt supplements approximating 10 meq/kg/day of sodium chloride, to maintain serum sodium >130 mEq/L. Results: AVPR2 gene sequencing revealed a p.Arg137Cys mutation. This gene mutation, located on the long arm of the X chromosome, causes a gain of function of the arginine vasopressin receptor that induces constitutive receptor activation in the absence of arginine vasopressin. Over the subsequent 6 months, the patient's table salt supplements were decreased gradually, maintaining serum sodium in the low normal range. Conclusions: AVPR2 mutations should be considered in infants and children presenting with symptomatic hyponatremia without laboratory evidence of SIADH. Objectives: Autosomal-recessive Steroid-resistant nephritic syndrome is a common cause of ESRD in children. Mutations in the TRPC6 gene are a major cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, whether the mutations of TRPC6 are also responsible for Chinese children with SRNS? And what's the differentiation of the TRPC6 expression between SRNS children and SSNS children? It's still unknown. Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of 37 SRNS patients, 22 steroid sensitive (SSNS) patients and 16 normal children, and we used PCR-amplifi ed each of 13 exons of TRPC6 gene sequence analysis. Immunohistochemistry method was used to detect the variance of TRPC6 expression between SRNS and SSNS children who had renal biopsy. Results: One novel synonymous mutation G42G (1151C>A) was identifi ed in three SRNS patients, which had not been found in the other two groups. Three biallelic SNPs were also found, including P15S (40C>T, rs3802829), -254C>G (rs3824934), and 237G>A. P15S and -254C>G were identifi ed in the promoter region, maybe they could take part in the regulation of this gene, and it's need further study. Immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of TRPC6 in nephric tubule were signifi cantly higher in SRNS patients than in SSNS children (P<0.01). Conclusions: As far, we had not found causative mutation in TRPC6 gene in Chinese children with SRNS. Maybe TRPC6 mutations were not a major cause of SRNS children in China, though the cohort was small. But, the expression of TRPC6 was higher in SRNS children than in SSNS children. And the two SNPs might act like a regulator of the promoter region of this gene. extracted from cultured cells, and RT-PCR detection of CD133 and CD146 mRNAs was performed. CD133-CD146+ cells were sorted by FACS and cultured to determine their ability to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic cells on media specifi cally suitable for differentiation into each cell type. Results: Cells could be cultured very effectively from the urine of patients with hematuria and/or proteinuria. RT-PCR showed expression of CD133 and CD146 mRNAs irrespective of whether the patients had nephropathy. Histochemical staining showed that the cells could differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts on the appropriate culture media. Conclusions: Renal mesenchymal stem cells can be cultured from the urine of pediatric patients with nephropathy. Urine may be a useful tool for regenerative medicine for kidney disease. 4 hours after IVP, slow increase thereafter, low physiologic level at night and achievement of an average level before 24 hours after IVP. Urine output was higher than previous days since patients were advised to keep suffi cient hydration. Conclusions: We suppose, that the decrease of FENa after IVP may result from renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation in response to hypotension and renal hypoperfusion following CM injection. That may also support a hypothesis of predominant role of prerenal mechanism possibly responsible for a precipitation of CIN.",

Objectives: NHE8 is the predominate sodium hydrogen exchanger in neonates and there is an isoform change at weaning to NHE3. The serum bicarbonate in neonates is lower than adults largely due to a lower rate of proximal tubule acidifi cation. It is unclear if the neonatal proximal tubule is functioning at maximal capacity or if it can respond to metabolic acidosis as in adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of metabolic acidosis in neonatal proximal tubules. Methods: Mice were gavaged orally with 1 mMol/100grams of body weight starting at 5 days of age with either NH 4 Cl or NaCl twice daily for 7 doses. The kidneys were harvested for brush border membrane (BBM) vesicle isolation, RNA for cDNA synthesis, or for proximal tubule isolation for in vitro microperfusion. Results: Acid gavaged neonates decreased their serum bicarbonate from 19.5 + 1.0 to 8.9 + 0.6 mEq/l (p<0.001). Proximal convoluted tubule Na + /H + exchanger activity (dpH/dt) was 1.68 + 0.19 pH units/min in control tubules and 2.49 + 0.60 pH units/min in acidemic neonatal mice (p<0.05) indicating an increase in Na + / H + exchanger activity. There was an increase in both NHE3 (vehicle 0.35 \u00b1 0.07 vs acid 0.73 \u00b1 0.07; p<0.01) and NHE8 BBM protein abundance (vehicle 0.41 \u00b1 0.05 vs acid 0.73 \u00b1 0.06; p<0.001) in acidemic neonates compared to controls, but no signifi cant difference in mRNA levels in either exchanger. Conclusions: Neonatal mice can adapt to metabolic acidosis by increasing the BBM expression of both NHE3 and NHE8 as well as increasing proximal tubule acidifi cation with an increase in proximal tubule Na + /H + exchange activity. This study shows that in neonates, NHE8 can play an adaptive role in response to acidosis.",

Uroguanylin (UGN), a peptide produced in the intestine, functions in the kidney as \"intestinal natriuretic hormone\". We investigated whether UGN exerts its effect on electrolyte homeostasis partly by modulating pendrin activity. Methods: qRT-PCR, immunofl uorescence, transfection experiments. Results: qRT-PCR analysis of HEK293 cells exposed to UGN showed a decrease in endogenous pendrin mRNA. Mice received UGN intravenously. Kidneys were harvested for pendrin mRNA quantifi cation and pendrin protein visualization. UGN-injected animals displayed a decrease in pendrin mRNA and protein expression. Luciferase reporter plasmids containing different length fragments of human PDS (hPDS) promoter were transfected into HEK293 cells. Exposure of cells to UGN decreased hPDS promoter activity compared to activity in control cells. Furthermore, the fi ndings provided evidence for the presence of a hypothetical UGN response element within the 96bp region between -1140bp and -1044bp on the hPDS promoter. This region overlaps with the previously demonstrated hypothetical pH response element. Conclusions: UGN inhibits pendrin expression at the transcriptional level in vitro and in vivo. Characterization of the UGN response element on the PDS promoter and its possible role in extracellular fl uid homeostasis and blood-pressure regulation awaits future studies.",

To investigate the main cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and the ratio of kidney transplantation. Methods: Methods Medical documentation of 77 children initiating HD therapy from January 2001 to February 2010 was analysed. The cause of ESRD, concomitance of hypertension, serum concentration of creatinine (Cr), serum level of BUN, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and hemoglobin were assessed. Fifty-two patients were followed up on March 2010. Results: Results Seventy-seven children (41 males, 36 females) aged from 30 months to 15.0 years were analysed. The causes of ESRD were: chronic glomerulonephritis (22.08%), refl ux nephropathy (16.88%), congenital renal disorder(16.88%), nephrotic syndrome (12.99%) and unknown origin (19.48%).",

Medical records were reviewed and data collected on the method and timing of TUS removal; TUS related and ureteric complications. Results: Of 180 RTR, 157 (64 [41%] female, 79 [50%] living donor transplants) were included. Cystoscopic TUS removal was performed in 151 patients at 8-90 (median 42) days with 30(20%) TUS complications: 16 UTI, 9 macroscopic haematuria, 4 migration, 1 blocked stent. These resulted in early TUS removal in 18 (64%) patients. Ureteric complications were found in 7(5 %) patients in this group (2 leak and 5 stenosis). Six patients had the TUS sutured to catheter, with stent removal on day 5 (4), day 10 (1) or day 21(1 stent attached to SPC). No patients in this group developed stent or ureteric complications. Conclusions: 20% of RTR had TUS complications, often resulting in the need for early removal. Suturing the TUS to the catheter to facilitate early removal appeared to be safe and may reduce the incidence of stent complications.

Pediatrics,  National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.    Objectives: NPHS2 mutations have been reported in familial and sporadic nephrotic syndrome (NS). We investigated the prevalence of NPHS2 mutations among Singaporean Chinese children and their association with clinical outcomes. Methods: Genomic DNA from 80 patients with primary sporadic NS (mean age at onset 5.4\u00b14.0 years, range 0.58-12.0 years) and 76 cord blood controls was screened using direct sequencing. Results: Eight NPHS2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identifi ed -four were located in the 5' promoter region (-670 C/T, -213G/A, -116 C/T and -51 G/T); with four in exons 2,5, and 8 (285 C/T, 685 C/A, 954 T/C and 1038 A/G). The genotypic frequencies were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. There was no signifi cant difference in allele frequencies between patients and controls. Using binary logistic regression analysis, homozygotes for -670 C were signifi cantly associated with the fi nding of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on biopsy (p=0.019, OR=5.9, 95%CI:1.34-25.9) and with poor response to prednisolone and cyclosporine alone, necessitating the use of mycophenolate (p=0.047, OR=3.73, 95%CI:1.02-13.7). Furthermore, this group was associated with eventual inability to wean off all medications with sustained (fi ve year) remission (p=0.027, OR=10.8, 95%CI:1.32-89.9). The presence of at least one copy of T at promoter position -51 was also associated with poor response to steroid therapy alone (p=0.024, OR=4.0, 95%CI:1.21-13.73). Conclusions: NPHS2 promoter polymorphisms may infl uence clinical outcomes in childhood NS. This effect may be mediated by regulation of NPHS2 transcription.Abstract# 609Frequency and Functional Relevance of C3 Gene Mutations in Children with Atypical HUS M. Malina, L. Roumenina, C.P.

Pediatric Nephrology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen,  Netherlands.    Objectives: Cystinosis is caused by intralysosomal accumulation of cystine and characterized by renal failure as well as deterioration of other organs. One of the known complications is thyroid failure. We analyzed risk factors for hypothyroidism. Methods: Medical histories of 36 cystinosis patients were analyzed. Data were collected on last known measurement in non hypothyroidism group (TSH<4.5 mU/L, n=23) and on time of diagnose of hypothyroidism in hypothyroidism group (TSH>4.5 mU/L, n=13). Mean age was not signifi cantly different (median 21.4 yrs (range 4.2-28.7) vs 13.9 (3.3-41.7), p=0.62). Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were used to analyze the data. Results: TSH was higher in hypothyroidism group(5.5 mU/L (2.8-36.7) vs 1.7 (0.4-4.2), p<0.01), while fT4 was similar in both groups (12.0 pmol/L (9.0-19.3) vs 12.6 (7.8-20.9), p=0.74).

Thereby more patients with hypothyroidism received a renal transplant (10/13 vs 9/23, p<0.05), of whom 8 developed hypothyroidism only after transplantation. Age at starting Cysteamine therapy was higher in hypothyroidism(2.8 yrs  (0.6-25.3) vs 1.3 (0.3-16.3), p<0.05).

Many children require general anaesthesia to avoid distress. Prone positioning under GA has higher risks requiring paralysis, endotracheal intubation, ventilation and protection of face. Lateral position is safer for GA. We compared the effi cacy and safety of USS guided renal biopsies between the two positions. Methods: In our department physician preference dictates positioning. We audited retrospective case notes and biopsy quality of consecutive biopsies in the two groups. Results: 44 lateral and 47 prone position biopsies were reviewed. Patient characteristics were similar in both groups for age, sex and indication for biopsy. Endotracheal intubation was carried out in all prone and 18% lateral patients. Diagnostic yield and complications were similar in both groups. No patients changed positions due to failed sampling. Conclusions: Lateral positioning result in no worse outcome for children requiring GA for renal biopsy. This position is recommended to reduce anaesthetic risk without compromising diagnostic yield.",

Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the differences the published pediatric eGFR based on cystatin C concentration (sCys) formulas results in calculations and the proposal for a new equation.Methods:The iohexol elimination technique was used as reference method in the study group of 93 patients.sCys was measured by nephelometric method. The results of the following equations were analysed: 1. Filler's equation (GFR F = C -1,123 x 91,622); 2. Grubb's pediatric (GFR G = 84,69 x C -1,68 x 1,384); 3.Schwartz's et al. 2009 (GFR s = 66,22  x C -0,777 ). All values were in ml/min/1,73m 2 . Results: The detailed mathematical comparison was performed and the statistically signifi cant differences among the results from equations (1), (2), (3) and the reference method were observed.The concordance of the results was noted only in lower values of eGFR. The sCys data allowed to create a new equation : eGFR = -7.28+82.29 x C -1 . The high correlation was proven between eGFR ac.to the new formula and to the reference method (r=0,952; p<0,00001) as corroborated by Bland-Altman fi gure. Conclusions: Filler's, Grubb's andSchwartz's et al. (2009)  formulas provide signifi cant differences in eGFR calculations in comparison to the iohexol method. The newly proposed by us formula: eGFR = -7.28+82.29 x C -1 seems to be more accurate for this purpose.Abstract# 704Hypernatriuria as a Cause of Hematuria in Children M.B. Zanolli, L.M.S.

Ozkurkcugil. 2 1 Pediatric Nephrology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey; 2 Urology, Kocaeli University School of Medicine, Kocaeli, Turkey. : Cranberry capsules(CC)  have been used as a prophylactic agent for urinary tract infection (UTI) but the effi cacy in neurogenic bladder(NB) is questionable. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the effi cacy of CC for prevention of recurrent UTI in children with NB. Methods: To be eligible for this study, patients had to have been followed up for a minimum of 6 months and urodynamic evaluation have been done. Patients with overactive detrusor (OAD) and hypocompliant bladder (HB) were elected for the evaluation of risk of infection rate according to bladder pathology. CC were prescribed as 1 capsule/day for the prevention of UTI. Any other prophylactic agents have not been used during follow up. Infection rate for each patient was calculated before and after CC usage. The medical and radiologic records of children(age \u2264 2 years), presenting with febrile UTI between January 2000 and December 2009, were retrospectively reviewed. In all cases, acute DMSA renal scan and micturating cystourethrography (MCU) had been performed. Results: A total of 370 children (233 boys and 137 girls) were included, of which 263 (71.1%) had abnormal DMSA result and 126 (34.1%) were identifi ed as VUR on MCU. Among children with VUR, the number of high-grade (III\u223cV grade) was 103 (81.7%). The sensitivity of DMSA for detecting high grade VUR was 99.0%. The negative predictive value was 99.1% and negative likelihood ratio was 0.03, respectively. In high-grade VUR group, the rate of abnormal DMSA result was signifi cantly higher than those in non-VUR group and low-grade VUR group (P<0.001).Conclusions: High-grade VUR remains an important risk factor for renal damage for young children with febrile UTI in China. The possibility to detect highgrade VUR on MCU is rather low when the result of DSMA is negative. DMSA should be the fi rst strategy to investigate the fi rst febrile UTI children at acute phase, which would predict the majority of children with high-grade VUR while presenting renal lesions.Objectives: Prompt but high-quality diagnosis of UTI is important as well as identifi cation of RS is also pertinent to keep children from future complications. We aimed to investigate the predictive ability of PCT for both APN and RS, in children with UTI. Methods: A meta-analysis of individual patient data. PCT may predict reasonably well APN then RS. LL-37 binds to curli fi mbrie and to their subunit CsgA. The structure and levels of CsgA monomers remain stable in the presence of LL-37. Cathelicidin inhibits polymerization of curli fi mbrie and formation of E. coli biofi lm. This effect is specifi c for LL-37 and was not observed if a scrambled peptide or a control peptide (VIP) was tested instead of cathelicidin. Conclusions: Here we describe a new mode of action of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Even at concentrations lower than bactericidal concentration, LL-37 inhibits the formation of E. coli biofi lm. This might be an important mechanism in the protection against recurrent urinary tract infections as well as a target of new treatment strategies.Renal Doppler Ultrasound in the Diagnosis of Acute PyelonephritisF. Cavagnaro, 1 L. Schonhaut, 1 B. Morales, 2 A. Espinoza. 2 1 Pediatrics, Cl\u00ednica Alemana de Santiago-Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile; 2 Radiology, Cl\u00ednica Alemana deSantiago, Santiago,  Chile. This propective study comprised 54 elegible children, aged 10 days to 12 years, admitted during 2009 to our pediatric unit with the fi rst febrile UTI. In all of them a DMSA renal scintigraphy and a RDU were done during the fi rst 72 hours into the hospital. Both studies were evaluated independently each other by pediatric radiologists, and the fi ndings were compared. Also all children were evaluated with blood tests looking at elevations of acute-phase reactants and white blood cells. The renal scintigraphy was considered the gold standard for diagnosing APN. Results: There were 42 children (77,8%) with abnormal renal scan, who also had signifi cantly altered the blood tests when compared with those with normal scintigraphy. RDU showed matching fi ndings with scintigraphy in 78%. The sensitivity and specifi city of RDU for the detection of APN were 78,6% and 75%, and the positive and negative predictive value were 91,7% and 50%, respectively. Conclusions: In clinically suspected APN, an abnormal RDU should avoid the use of DMSA renal scintigraphy. However, due to the low negative predictive value of RDU, we suggest to complete the study with a renal scintigraphy when the RDU is normal, mainly if they have altered blood tests.Objectives: Despite recent advances in molecular epidemiology and pathogenecity analyses of extraintestinal E. coli infections, detailed analyses identifying virulence factors of E. coli isolates from pediatric urosepsis patients have not been reported. This study was conducted to explore and differentiate bacterial virulence factors associated with urosepsis and two other severe parenchymal infections, acute pyelonephritis (APN) and acute lobar nephronia (ALN). Initial US was abnormal in 32 patients and initial R was abnormal in 28 patients. At follow-up prophylactic antibiotics (AB) was prescribed to 20 patients, 20 patients were diagnosed with urological anomalies, 10 of these with vesicoureteral refl ux (VUR). Surgery was performed in 9 patients, 6 of these for VUR.Based on NICE-guidelines, 5 patients operated on for VUR would not initially have been identifi ed, 9 would not have received AB and 5 would still be ignorant to another urological diagnosis. This is unsatisfying considering the possibility of endoscopic therapy and the increasing problems with bacteria resistant to AB.Conclusions:We do not recommend the NICE-guidelines, especially not for children 0.6 to 3 years of age, but recommend initially US and R at fi rst episode of pyelonephritis.Urinary Tract Infection in Children withChronic Liver Disease Waiting for Liver Transplantation S.M.

A statistically signifi cant but weak correlation was found between urinary calcium excretion and body weight, height and age. No association could be found between IH and the recurrence of UTI, presence of vesicoureteral refl ux, scar formation and prognosis. Conclusions: Since urinary tract infections and their complications are signifi cant causes of morbidity and mortality, hypercalciuria should be kept in mind while investigating risk factors for UTI, especially in patients with hematuria, recurrent UTI and family history of IH though its effect on renal scarring and recurrence of UTI could not be shown in this study.",

Conclusions: high rate of renal scarring in the elder age group may be related to delay in recognition and referral of children with UTI. Renal scarring may occurs even after a single UTI. General practitioners in developing countries should be aware of the serious complications of UTI and the need for earlier recognition and management.Objectives:To determine the best protocol of study of the urinary tract (UT) after fi rst episode of pyelonephritis (PN) to diagnose renal scar and uropathy, improve management and reduce radiation dosage without risk of renal damage. Methods: Transversal analysis of 365 patients at follow-up after PN through 10 years. First protocol, patients under 5 years undergo sonography (US); 7 days intravenous treatment (IV), prophylactic treatment (PT), voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and renal scan (RS) after 9 months. 2\u00ba reduced IV to 3 days. Third protocol the age was reduced to 2 years old or bladder sphincter control. Fourth protocol, with the same age than previous, include only a RS and US, if US anormal they received PT and VCU was performed, if US normal no PT neither VCU. Results: First protocol included 25; second 24, third 177 and fourth 139 patients. We didn't fi nd difference in renal scars between 3 Vs 7 days IV; patients with VUR or not; recurrent pyelonephritis or not. We found VUR in 16%; 19%; 26% and 14%; renal scars in 25%; 18%; 18% and 28%. Only 6% of patients without VCU present new PN and when VCU was performed low degree vesicoureteral refl ux (VUR) were diagnosed, so management would be the same. Conclusions: There is not important to diagnose low degree VUR because it is not clear if it is useful PT or surgical treatment so VCU may be avoided. If the objective of the UT it is to prevent and diagnose renal scar, we think it is possible to reduce the number of VCU because it is not the main factor in renal scar genesis. This prospective study included patients aged <19 y/o diagnosed with UTI. They were divided into 2 groups: single and recurrent UTI. Data were collected regarding gender, age, clinical manifestations and family history of urolithiasis. Serum calcium, urinalysis, urine calcium & creatinine (UCa/Cr) or 24-hr urine calcium excretion were determined once UTI has resolved. Data was expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Descriptive analyses was performed for the calculation of frequencies. The group included sixty three children(24 boys and 39 girls)aged between 1 and 97 months years old(mean 20)with primary VUR receiving 0.5 ml/ Kg ivumir per day.Medium follow-up:24 months.Fifty seven patients underwent voiding cystourethrogram after initial episode of UTI,six in consequence of fetal diagnosis of pyelectasia.In these children 90 refl uxing ureteres were involved(grade I:3,II:31,III:39,IV:16,V:1).10 patients had other associated urogenital malformations. We conclude that administration of standard concentrated cranberry juice is free from side effects and effective in preventing UTI in pediatric patients with VUR including high grade VUR and urinary tract malformations associated. Larger prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to confi rm our preliminary results.Urine Collection in Non Toilet-Trained Children: Is Catheter AlwaysMore Painful Than Bag? J.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that TLR4, a key element of innate defense, is associated with susceptibility to UTI in children. Methods: We determined TLR4 A(896)G polymorphism by means of PCR in 113 children with upper UTI. Of them, 63 aged <2 years (34 F, 29 M) and 50 were >2 years (43 F, 7 M). Genotypes were compared with that of 230 controls. Clinical data were statistically evaluated. Our fi ndings show that carrier status of TLR4 (896)G is associated with altered ability of girls >2 years to respond to urinary pathogens. It is suggested, that this polymorphism acts in concert with other innate and acquired factors to infl uence the physiological defense against UTI.Objectives: There is only limited knowledge of Acute Focal Bacterial Nephritis (AFBN) in children.

Comparison of the Effi cacy of Renal Ultrasonography, 99mtechnetium DMSA Renal Scan in Children with Urinary Tract Infection with Vesicourethral Refl ux in Korea I.S. Lim, S. Kim. Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine,Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea.    Recently, questions have been risen over the effi cacy of renal ultrasonography in patients who have been previously diagnosed with UTI, and there has been controversy over the use of various imaging methods in the diagnosis of UTI. So therefore, we studied the effi cacy of renal ultrasonography and 99mTc-DMSA renal scan in the diagnosis of UTI with VUR in Korea.Methods for Reliability of Urine Culture from Bag Specimens in Urinary Tract Infection in InfantsI.S. Lim. Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine,Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea.    : Since infants with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs) cannot control urination, urine cultures for diagnosis are usually performed via urine bags. This method is noninvasive but has a high contamination rate. We studied the contamination rate of bag urine culture in diagnosing UTIs in infants under one year and the factors responsible for contamination in Korea, in order to achieve additional reliability of this method. Methods: We examined patients under one year in whom urine culture through the urine bag method yielded over 10 5 colonies of a single pathogen. We defi ned UTIs by referring to the guidelines of 2009 report of the committee on infectious diseases. We examined the factors responsible for contamination according to sex, duration of urine collection, and whether diarrhea took place with contamination rate. Results: We examined 537 patients (372 males and 162 females). The contamination rate of one bag urine culture was 31.3%. Gender was not related to the contamination rate, but duration of urine collection showed an association with it (P<0.05). When duration of urine collection was divided into three groups: fi rst group, <2 hours; second group, 2-4 hours; and third group, \u22654 hours, the contamination rates was 27.5%, 41.2%, and 44.1%, respectively (P=0.001). And diarrhea at admission had no impact on the contamination rate. Conclusions: In infants with a suspected UTIs, urine collection for culture by bag method should be fi nished within 2 hours. If it takes over 2 hours, the urine bag must be removed and a new bag should be reattached to the infant for reliable results.Prevalence of Monosynptomatic and NonmonosymptomaticEnuresis in 739 School Children G.T.B.

In one third of affected children VUR maturated spontaneously, second third was successfully treated with Defl ux application. Only 9 children required classic surgical approach. Refl ux nephropathy was diagnosed only in 3 children.Conclusions:Our results show that diagnostic procedures in children after the fi rst UTI have been performed in 28.8% of these children and VUR diagnosed in 8.0% of them, mainly with VUS. They speak in favor of the new management algorithm of these children.Objectives: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are frequent in children and often recur. Antibiotic treatment may produce side-effects and microbial resistance. Since Cranberry is effective in reducing the number of UTI in adults we performed a study in children with recurrent UTI. Profi laxys with IVUMIR reduces the rate of UTI. It is diffi cult to predict which child will benefi t of this treatment.The study was performed on 88 patients suspected to haveUTI.Blood sample was drawn forCBC,diff,CRP,ESR & serum PCT level ( in the fi rst 6 hours).Urinalysis & urine culture was checked.DMSA scan was done for all. IsotopicVCUG was performed after obtaining negative urine culture.PCT levels were measured by immunoluminometric method.Levels above0.5 ng/ml were considered as elevated. Results: 58 cases had known to have UTI.On the basis of parenchymal involvement on DMSA scan,patients were devided in groupA with PN(30 Objectives: Background:This study is evaluate the diagnostic value of MRVCUG as a non-invasive and non-radiating alternative method to standard VCUG for diagnosis, managing and follow up of patient with VUR.

Mollik. Objectives: Plants are widely used world wide to address a variety of health problems. Because of living conditions in rural areas of Bangladesh, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Traditional health practitioners (THPs) provide primary healthcare to most of the rural population of Bangladesh and they use plants for this purpose. The THPs rely on decoctions made from plants or plant parts to treat UTIs, which decoctions can vary widely between THPs in the various districts of the country. The present ethnopharmacological survey was carried out in Lakshmipur district of Bangladesh. Methods: An open-ended semi-structured questionnaire was used in collecting fi eld information. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the ethnopharmacological data collected. Factor of informant consensus was used to analyze the ethnopharmacological importance of the plants. The THPs described the signs, symptoms, and causes of UTIs. Details of the preparation and use of plants for management of UTIs were recorded. All plant samples were later identifi ed at the Bangladesh National Herbarium. Results: A total of 53 plant species representing 48 genera and 38 families employed in the traditional indigenous therapeutic applications of the people in Lakshmipur district of Bangladesh; are recorded from 321 homes. It was noted in this ethnopharmacological survey that the patients were quite satisfi ed with treatment by the THPs.",

She had no dysuria, frequency, urgency, incontinence, history of trauma or bleeding disorder. Physical and genitourinary tract examinations were normal. Urinanalysis showed gross haematuria. Urine culture, renal and bladder ultrasound and urography were normal. Cystoscopy showed cystic changes and haemorrhagic erosions of the trigonal part of the bladder and urethra. Biopsy of lesions was performed and pathologic evaluation demonstrated nonkeratinizing squamous metaplastic cells. Urethral cultures revealed Ureaplasma urealitycum infection that was treated with appropriate antibiotics. Results: After two cycles of antibiotics she had no haematuria and urethral smear culture was sterile. Control cystoscopy showed a mild regression of cystic changes and erosions of bladder mucosa. Conclusions: Nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia is a sign of chronic infection, in this case with Ureaplasma urealyticum. It can be present as gross haematuria.

Cubero, N.J. Sebire, S.D. Marks. Department of Paediatric  Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust,  London, England, United Kingdom.   :  We report a case of vasculitis secondary to mephedrone (amphetaminelike drug) which fulfi ls the classifi cation criteria of HSP without IgA deposition on skin or renal biopsy. Methods: A 15-year old man presented with a vasculitic rash two hours after taking mephedrone. He developed macroscopic haematuria and lethargy without abdominal pain or joint swelling. He was pale and hypertensive at 144/100mmHg with peripheral and periorbital oedema and purpura on his legs, feet and back. He had no arthritis or joint effusions. Results: He had 3+ proteinuria and 3+ haematuria with urine albumin : creatinine ratio of 237.1mg/mmol. He had haemoglobin of 8.8g/dl with elevated ESR and CRP of 30mm/hour and 68mg/l. His plasma creatinine was 65umol/l (eGFR of 86mls/min/1.73m 2 ) with albumin of 20g/l. He had elevated complement C3 of 2.27g/l with elevated IgA of 3.52g/l which normalised within a month. He had normal C4, IgG and IgM with negative ASOT, ANA, ANCA and autoimmune profi le. He had bilateral enlarged echogenic kidneys on renal ultrasound. His skin biopsy showed a leucocytoclastic vasculitis with perivascular deposition of C1q without IgA deposition. His percutaneous renal biopsy showed 61% glomeruli with necrotising segmental lesions and 26% fi brocellular crescents without IgA deposition. Conclusions: He was treated with corticosteroids, enalapril and furosemide, and 3 months later, he has clinically improved with less albuminuria (59.2mg/ mmol), normal serum albumin with normal renal function. Although fulfi lling the classifi cation criteria for HSP, we present the fi rst case of mephedrone-induced vasculitis.Immunosuppressive Treatment Responses in Steroid ResistantNephrotic Syndrome with Podocine Gene Mutation Positive and Negative Turkish Children S. Mir, F. Mutlubas, A. Berdeli, O.D. Kara. Pediatric Nephrology, Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey. : First line immunosuppressive treatment in steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) in children is still open to discussion. The detection of an NPHS2 mutation affects treatment plan with SRNS. The aim was to compare treatment responses of podocine mutation positive and negative SRNS patients. Methods: 63 SRNS children were included. Mutation analysis was performed in 8exons of NPHS2 gene with direct DNA sequencing. There were 26 children with NPHS2mutations and 37 children with no mutation. Immunosuprresives were various such as cyclosporinA(CsA), cyclophosphamide(CyC), Mendoza protocole(MP), Plasmaphresis(PP), mycophenolate-mophetil(MMF). Responses were as complete(CR), partial remission(PR) and no response(NR).Results: The most prefered drug was CyC and the most long-lasting used drug was CsA. PPand MMF were used (n=2)with NR. The remission rate(RR) of MP was found to be similar in groups (40%-37%) with steroid side effects. While RR with CyC in groups were similar, CsA RR was signifi cantly high in patients with no mutation(75%). The duration ofCsA was longer in group with no mutation. No side-effect detected with both CsA-CyC. The patients,showed CR withCsA, in mutation group were carrying single allele mutation. Conclusions: This study highlights CsA is stil an important drug in children with no mutation in long-lasting usage without side effects. MP may be used as last choice. The effi cacy and safety of CyC treatment is not higher thanCsA. The patients who were carrying single allele mutation and no mutation are worth to treat to achieve remission or prolongation of process going to ESRD.Pediatric Lupus Nephritis: 12 Year Experience from a Single CentreA.

Pecoraro. 1 1 NephroUrology, Santobono Hospital, Naples, Italy; 2 University Federico II, Naples, Italy. : To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MMF for inducing and maintaining remission of childhood LN. Methods: 27 children with LN, mean age: 3.3 yrs; M/F: 6:1; Symptoms: proteinuria (89%), hematuria (100%), Nephrotic Syndrome (48%), ARF (22%), Hypertension (33%). Renal Biopsies, before MMF, showed the following classes (Weening): IV in 14 cases, III in 3, II in 8, V in 1, VI in 1. Treatment: i.v. Metilprednisolone pulse for three consecutive days and then MMF (plus oral Prednisone (P)) at mean dose: 29\u00b17.7 mg/Kg/day. Results: At a mean follow up 4.5 yrs (0.9-7.7) proteinuria was absent in 7 pts,< 0.5 gr/day in 9, < 1g/day in 6, < 2g/day in 3, > 2g/day in 2. Renal funcion normalized in 5/6 pts with ARF and worsened in the remaining one. SLEDAI score decreased signifi cantly (p<0.01), plasma C3 levels normalized in 66%. In 10 pts a second renal biopsy, after 2 years MMF treatment, was performed: histopathological activity indices reduced signifi cantly (8.76\u00b1 2.55 vs 5.3\u00b161.97), chronicity index did not change. P was tapered and, after 5.6\u00b12.5 months, stopped in 15 pts; 12 pts were receiving P at a mean dose 0.3 mg/Kg. 5 pts showed proteinuric fl ares effectively treated with the increase of oral P. Clinical signs of hypercorticysm dramatically improved. No haematological side effects, in 3 pts gastrointestinal symptoms occurred; just one patient had Herpes Zoster infection. Conclusions: MMF represents a good alternative to traditional therapy of childhood LN allowing, as monotherapy too, a clinical and histopathological control of disease activity without signifi cant side effects.

Pediatric Nephrology, Ege University Faculty of  Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.   :  Mutations in podocin(NPHS2) cause OR steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome SRNS). Different populations have different types of NPHS2 mutations and clinical progress. There are also various behavior of the same mutation in different populations. The aim was to display types of NPHS2gene mutation with clinical behaviour in Turkish children. Methods: Steroid resistance was accepted as no achievement with prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d 4 weeks)in primary nephrotic syndrome patients. 63children (38boys and 25girls) with SRNS were included. Mutation analysis was performed in all 8 exons of NPHS2 gene with direct DNAsequencing method. Results: Podocin mutations were present in 41.3% (26/63) of patients and 17//26 were in 2 alleles.Nonsense, frameshift, deletion and missense mutations were in ratios of, 11.5, 11.5, 7.7 and 69.3%, respectively. Nonsense and frameshift mutations were related with early-onset(1,2 years). Patients with R138Q mutations displayed early and late-onset SRNS,developed ESRD. R168H was found to be related early-onset and rapidly ESRD. R229Q mutation were found in 8/26patients and 2 of them reached to ESRD with late-onset. V180M was detected in early-onset SRNS and found to be related remission after CsA. Conclusions: Nonsense and frameshift mutations cause early-onset SRNSand ESRD. Missense mutations such as R138Q and R168H in homozygous associate with early-onset or infantil NS with progressing to ESRD. R229Q seems to be related with late-onset NS and ESRD. Contraversy to literature,V180M may results with early-onset FSGS. These different behaviour of the mutations may originate from additional factors that can modify the phenotype in years.Nonischemic Nephrotic Syndrome Associated with PrimaryAntiphospholipid Syndrome H.J.

Department of Paediatrics, KK Women's & Children's Hopsital, Singapore, Singapore.Objectives: Bartonella quintana historically caused Trench Fever. We report an unusual paediatric case with post infectious GN who presented with severe AKI due to Bartonellosis. Methods: M is a 11 years old Malay boy who presented with bilateral massive cervical lymphadenopathy, poor feeding and oliguria. Investigations showed severe AKI: serum creatinine 627umol/L, urea 65.3*, potassium 5.1*, phosphate 3.8* (*mmol/L). Haemodialyis (CVVHD) was commenced for the next 4 days. Serology test for Barotonella quintana was positive (Ig M titre \u2265 20). M subsequently developed atypical nephrotic syndrome: hypoalbuminemia, anasarca, hyperlipidemia, nephrotic range proteinuria, hypertension and haematuria. Complement 3 (C3) level was low (C4 normal). Ig A, dsDNA, ANCA, anti GBM and ASOT were negative. Renal biopsy showed diffuse proliferative GN with 38% cellular crescents on LM and isolated subepithelial hump-like electron dense deposits on EM consistent with acute post infectious GN. M was managed conservatively with fl uid restriction and antihypertensives with subsequent diuresis, resolution of hypertension and proteinuria. He was discharged well on Day 28 of illness with normalization of C3 and renal function. Results: Conclusions: Bartonella quintana is recognized as an emerging pathogen among the homeless and immunocompromised populations but remains rare as a cause of post infectious GN in healthy paediatric patients. The clinical course for most patients with post infectious GN is excellent with full spontaneous recovery. We report a fi rst such case in a healthy 11 year old child who represented with severe AKI with full recovery of renal function.Cyclophosphamide Treatment for Diffuse Proliferative Lupus Glomerulonephritis: The Role of Reversal of Renal Histiology D.Nguyen thi Ngoc, L. Huynh Thoai. Nephrology, Children's Hospital 1, Ho Chi Minh, Viet Nam. : In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), renal biopsy not only guides to therapy but also predicts to response and relapse. Methods: Prospective study Results: We described 51 patients with SLE, admitted to the Children Hospital 1 in the period from 1/2003 to 1/2008, whose initial biopsy (Bx1) showed proliferative lupus nephritis class III, IV by ISN/RPS (International Society of Nephrology/ Renal Pathology Society) and who received 6 monthly doses of intravenously administered cyclophosphamide. Repeat renal biopsy (Bx2) was done at sixth dose. Bx2 showed histological improvement by ISN/RPS classifi cation in 35 children (17 complete remission; 15 partial remission, 3 non response), 14 patients were unchanged (6 complete remission; 7 partial remission, 1 non response), and 2 patients were worse (both were partial remission). Activity index (AI) decreased 100% of patients in complete remission group, 62.5% of patients in partial remission (p=0.03). 11 (23.4%) patients relapsed after CYC induction, mean relapse time was 13.7 months. Non-improved AI occurred in 36% of relapse patients and 13.8 % of non relapse patients. Conclusions: There were no correlation between the clinical response and histological improvement after 6 months CYC IV. Improved AI at Bx2 showed response to treatment, those who did not improve are at risk for fl ares.Treatment Strategy and Outcome for Henoch-Schonlein Purpura Nephritis T. Ninchoji, 1 Y.

Objective: to evaluate the response to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in children with SRNS. Methods: We recruited 42 children (26 girls, 16 boys with SRNS), age 3.2 +/-4.4 years. All patients received at least one course of 8-12 weeks of therapy with oral prednisone; renal biopsy was performed in 37/42 cases prior to the administration of MMF. The dose of MMF was 600 mgs/m2/ day for 6-18 months and prednisone was reduced stepwise. Patients were evaluated clinically periodically, and proteinuria and serum creatinine, among others, were checked every 3 months. Results: 27 patients had complete remission, 9 partial remission and 6 no response. Mean follow up was 9.2 +/-4.8 months. Of the responders 85% had either minimal change disease or mesangioproliferative nephritis (MGN) (22 cases), 2 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FGS); all but one of the partially responders had MGN and the no responders corresponded to 4 FGS, 1 membranous nephropathy and 1 MGN.

Pediatric Nephrology, Research Institute of Pediatrics & Children Surgery, Moscow, Russian Federation. :The study was conducted to evaluate the effi cacy and safety of tacrolimus (TAC) in children with idiopathic SRNS. Methods: Seven children (6 girls/1 boy) median age 12.5 (range: 9.5-13.0) years with initial SRNS were treated with a 12 months course of TAC. The hystological assessment revealed FSGS (n=4), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) (n=2) and MPGN (n=1). Initial TAC dose was 0.1 mg/kg/24h (target through level 5.0-10.0 ng/mL) in combination with alternate-day prednisolone dose 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/24h for 3 months. The median time from the diagnosis to TAC initiation was 28.0 (range: 6.0-96.0) months. Four patients had failed Cyclosporin A, MMF or cyclophosphamide therapy prior to the treatment with TAC. None of the patients had mutations of the NPHS2 or NPHS1 genes. Tacrolimus can be considered as effective immunosuppressive therapy for SRNS in children allowing for 57.1% rate of combined complete and partial remission. Further randomized control trials are required to determine potential therapeutic value of tacrolimus in the management of SRNS in children.IgA Nephropathy and Paracoccidioidomycosis brasiliensisS.Z.P Rigatto, V.M.S.

State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. : To present the fi rst description, based on the literature, the association of IgA Nephropathy and Paracoccidioidomycosis brasiliensis.Methods: Girl 6 years old had abdominal pain for 1 year, worsening in last 6 months with vomits and painful nodules in the neck. In last month, daily high fever, weight loss (4 kg), and progressive pallor for 15 days, urine color of cola. From the urban area of metropolitan city, had no family history relevant. Physical examination: pallor, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Results: Urinalysis :> 100 red blood cells / fi eld with cod\u00f3citos and acanthocytes, hyaline casts, granular, hemoglobin and leukocyte and 24-hour proteinuria of 420mg. Creatinine clearance of 28 ml/min/1, 73m2. Serum complement: C3 and C4 normal. Ac anti-DNA and ANA negative Lymph node biopsy: Presence of sporulation compatible with Paracoccidioides brasilienisis Renal biopsy: renal tubular atrophy, interstitial fi brosis and increase in mesangial cellularity. Immune complexes of IgA paramesangial There was resolution of renal disease after 5 months of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. She is now 4 years without medication with normal urinalysis and renal function, no proteinuria.Conclusions:The temporal association between the IgA nephropathy and paracoccidioidomycosis suggests a direct relation for the etiology. the mechanism could be similar than the related with Tuberculosis and IgA nephropathy. Both are antigens presented precociously in the respiratory mucosal, stimulating cellular and humoral immunity for prolonged time. This report reinforces the possibility of different etiological mechanisms of and immunopathogenicity in N. IgA and therefore different prognosis.Is Cyclophosphamide Effective in Patients withIgM Positive Minimal Change Disease? A. Roushdi, P. Geier, J. Vethamuthu, J. Feber. Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON, Canada. Objectives: The aim of the study was: 1) To assess the effi cacy of cyclophosphamide (CYC) in patients with steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) and minimal change disease (MCD). 2) To compare the response to CYC between IgM positive and IgM negative patients with MCD. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all children who received CYC for SDNS/MCD on kidney biopsies from 1998 to 2009. Patients were divided into two groups based on IgM positivity on biopsy. Time to the fi rst relapse post CYC was calculated and used for relapse-free survival analysis. Results: Out of 17 children included in the study, 11 were MCD/IgM positive and 6 were MCD/IgM negative. The mean\u00b1SD cumulative CYC dose was 173\u00b133 mg/kg. The percentages of patients without relapse post CYC were: 82% at 12 months, 69% at 24 months, 60% at 36 months and 40% at 48 months. There was no statistical difference in relapse free survival time between MCD/IgM negative and MCD/IgM positive patients; hazard ratio = 1.77 (95% CI = 0.4 to 8.4), p=0.47. Conclusions: Almost 70% of patients with SDNS/MCD remained relapse-free for two years post CYC therapy without exceeding the recommended cumulative dose. CYC can therefore be recommended as a fi rst line steroid sparing agent for patients with SDNS and MCD regardless of IgM positivity on kidney biopsy. Development of a Global Registry of Children with Complicated Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome N. Rutjes, A. Bouts, J.-C. Davin.Objectives: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) in childhood is a rare disease. As a result, randomized controlled trials evaluating medical therapies are scarce and often of poor quality. Consequently there is no consensus regarding treatment of patients with INS, which leads to discrepancies in the management of INS. A global web-based registry (www.nsregistry.org) was developed to study children with complicated INS, and provide a framework for the organization of clinical trials. The registry is free for clinical use. Methods: Consensus was reached among pediatric nephrologists from The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and France regarding the sets of data to be registered about patients with INS complicated by steroid resistance / dependence or frequent relapses. These data sets were synchronized with various other nephrotic syndrome registries to allow for future comparison/ assimilation of data. Results: A web-based registry was developed with domains for pediatric nephrologists / patients. Disease specifi c data can be entered regarding all aspects of disease e.g. fi rst manifestation of disease, therapy, genetic analysis and outcome. In addition overviews and various statistics can be generated.Conclusions:The use of this multi-purpose disease registry could enhance our knowledge about demographics, treatment and prognosis of complicated INS and aid in the development of treatment guidelines for these patients. Its use could facilitate the management of patients with complicated INS. In addition international multi-center randomized controlled trials can be implemented within the framework of this registry. (Presented on behalf of the EURO-WINS working group)Development of a Global Registry of Children with ComplicatedIdiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome: Patient Domain for Parents N. Rutjes, 1 M. van Meel, 2 J.-C.Davin. 1 1 Pediatric Nephrology, Emma  Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 2 NephcEurope,  Bodegraven, Netherlands.    : Parents of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), organized in NephcEurope, have expressed their desire for the development of a system that allows them to register data regarding their child's disease. For this purpose, we now have developed a dedicated patient domain as part of the web-based Nephrotic Syndrome Registry (NSR, www.nsregistry.org). Methods: In close collaboration with the European patient organization NephcEurope, data sets were defi ned to meet the needs and situation of parents of children with INS complicated by steroid resistance / dependence or frequent relapses. In addition data forms were designed to complement the registry data collected by their pediatric nephrologist. Results: As part of the web-based NSR registry a patient domain was developed. After registration of a patient by their pediatric nephrologist in the registry, parents can access the patient domain and enter data regarding demographics, patient surveys, relapses, urine dipstick measurements, hospital visits, medication, dialysis, transplantation and receive reminders of upcoming hospital visits by email or SMS. Statistics can be easily generated to provide insight in the child's past medical / treatment history. Conclusions: A dedicated patient domain was developed within the web-based idiopathic nephrotic syndrome registry, allowing parents to register data regarding their child's disease. This registry could help parents manage their child's disease, complement registration by their nephrologist and further improve the care of children with complicated INS.Study of the Factor Which Affects to the Concentration of Mizoribine with Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome PatientsA.

Pediatric Nephrology, Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. : Evaluation of clinical and laboratory response of children with steroidresistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), as well as its effi cacy and safety. MMF is a selective reversible inhibitor of the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, responsible for the inhibition of the de novo synthesis of purines. Preliminary studies suggest benefi cial effects of MMF as adjunctive therapy in the nephrotic syndrome (NS). However, there are limited data on the effi cacy of MMF in pediatric patients with SRNS.Methods: Retrospective evaluation of clinical and laboratory data of 13 pediatric patients with SRNS, previously treated with an 8-week course of prednisone 2 mg/kg/day, followed by a 3-month course of cyclophosphamide and one year of cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/day for 6 months and 2,5 mg/kg/day for more 6 months), with no response. These patients were submited to 250 to 500 mg/m2 of body surface per day of MMF. After a period of one year, data was acessed for laboratory results, clinical response to treatment and adverse side effects. Results: 10 patients showed no edema and remained asymptomatic. Two patients presented clinical descompensation, but only one experienced adverse events (nausea and vomiting) and had the medication discontinued. However, all patients remained proteinuric (average 44 mg/kg/day). Conclusions: Effective clinical response was observed with the use of MMF in children with SRNS. Poor or none laboratory response was observed. Additional studies are necessary to confi rm MMF effectiveness and evaluate alternative treatments to SRNS in children.Cyclosporine Use in Children with Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome J.R.

Pathology, State Medical University, Yerevan, Armenia; 3 Inst. of Surgical Pathology, Univ. Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland; 4 University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.Objectives: Differentiation may be diffi cult in cases of endocapillary proliferative GN with subepithelial deposits (humps, typical for APGN) and concurrent subendothelial deposits (typical for MPGN-I). We studied 7 patients (Yerevan 4, Zurich 3) with overlapping histology. Methods: Biopsies of native kidneys were performed during 2001-2009 in 265 pediatric patients (Yerevan 130, Zurich 135). Additional evaluation of Armenian patients was done in Zurich by LM, EM and immunohistochemistry (for patients in Zurich immunofl uorescence). Results: Patients (5 m, 2 f; 7-17 y/o) had biopsies 2-6 months after initial presentation. All seven showed both humps and subendothelial deposits. Based on the main distinguishing fi nding (diffuse double contours of the GBM with subendothelial deposits, diagnostic for MPGN-I) defi nitive diagnosis was made in 4 (2 APGN, 2 MPGN-I), but diagnosis remained presumptive in 2 APGN and 1 MPGN-I. Repeat biopsy in one of them considered to have APGN now showed unequivocal MPGN-I. Therapy consisted of ACE-inhibitors (7) and prednisone (6). After 1/2 to 4 years four had proteinuria and 1 each ESRF, haematuria and remission. Conclusions: Histological differentiation between APGN and MPGN-I may be diffi cult in biopsies showing endocapillary proliferative GN. Finding of diffuse double contours of the GBM with subendothelial deposits, suggesting MPGN-I, is helpful. Rarely a second biopsy may be required.",

Thai Pediatric Lupus Study Group, Bangkok, Thailand.Objectives: To determine the correlation of health related quality of life (HRQOL) and disease activity as well as damage in Thai children with SLE and Lupus nephritis. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in eleven hospitals in all parts of Thailand.The data of 264 patients with SLE, age at diagnosis less than 15 years, diagnosed during 1 January 2002 to 31 May 2009 were reviewed. Severity and complication of the disease were assessed using European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement index ( ECLAM ) and SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI) respectively. PedsQL TM 4.0 Generic Core Scale (Thai version) was used to assess HRQOL of the patients. Results: There were 41 (15.5%) male and 223 (84.5%) female patients, the mean age was 11.09 + 2.5 years.The patients had SLE mean duration of 1.98 + 1.7 ( range 0-7) years. Among 203 patients who underwent kidney biopsy 152 patients (74.8 %) had Lupus nephritis class III -V. The mean ECLAM index was 1.07 + 1.7. Mean SDI was 0.3 + 0.5. The mean HRQOL of the total summary score was 22.6 + 13.6. The means score for physical health, emotion, social and school function were 22.2 + 16, 23.5 + 19.1, 15.6 + 16.7 and 29.4 + 16.9  respectively.

Tikhomirov, 2 L. Leonova, 3  T.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of NPHS2 mutations in Russian pediatric patients with biopsy proven steroid-resistant FSGS/MCD. Methods: During the years 2003-2009 sixty nine children were diagnosed with steroid resistant NS in the reference pediatric centre with the wide geographic representativeness across Russia. Afterwards Cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment with or without methylprednisolone pulses and oral prednisolone was introduced. If no response was seen after 8-10 months, patients were investigated for NPHS2 by direct sequencing. Results: Finally, 24 patients were classifi ed as having CsA resistance. After direct sequencing, in eight of them mutations of NPHS2 were determined. So, the total prevalence of podocin mutations in steroid-resistant FSGS/MCD is 11,6% where as in CsA-resistant it was 33,3%. Children with a confi rmed mutations had early (1,6\u00b10,34 years old) onset without any clinical differences from non-genetic forms of the disease. Half of these patients had an early hypertension, two had normochromic anemia. Two children were from the same family carrying same mutation. The most often mutations were R139Q (3 children), R229Q and G87A (2 children each). Conclusions: We conclude, that podocin mutations may be the cause of steroidresistant FSGS/MCD in at least 11,6% of cases. All patients, especially with early onset of the disease need direct sequencing before aggressive treatment.Method of Quantitative Assessment of IHC Staining inKidney Glomeruli I.V. Sakharau, 1 N.I.

Department of  Nephrology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Okura,  Setayaga-ku, Japan.   :  The prognosis of childhood steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is poor. Approximately 40% of patients progress to end-stage renal failure (ESRD).Since there have been few reports of SRNS in Japan,we examined its prognosis. Methods: Forty fi ve children (29 males, 16 females) with SRNS, who were treated in our institute between 1989 and 2008, were retrospectively studied. Median follow-up period was 93.3 months (15-250 months). Congenital and secondary nephrotic syndrome were excluded. Results: The mean onset age was 6.2 years. Primary steroid non-responders were 29 of the 45 patients and 16 were late. Renal biopsies showed minimal change disease in 26 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 14 and diffuse mesangial proliferation in 5. Nine patients never remitted, among whom 6 progressed to ESRD and 3 still presented proteinuria. Thirty-six patients became steroidsensitive nephrotic syndrome through cyclosporine (CsA), and only one of these 36 progressed to ESRD. Primary non-responders had more risk of ESRD than late non-responders(odds ratio, 3.61). Seven become free from medication, but 20 suffered steroid-dependent or frequent-relapsing nephrotic syndrome (SDNS/ FRNS). Owing to severe side effects of steroid and/or CsA,16 of the 20 SDNS/ FRNS patients were unavoidably treated with off-label rituximab. Conclusions: This prognosis seems better than those in previous reports. However, long-term and complete remission were rare, and approximately 40% of SRNS patients suffered SDNS/FRNS. For such refractory patients, rituximab is a hopeful option for achieving long-term remission.Demographic, Clinical Features, Initial Management and 12 Months Follow up of Children with Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome in aTeaching Hospital at Dhaka, Bangladesh G.M.

However, the underlying diseases are mostly unknown and diagnostic or therapeutic options poorly defi ned. The aim of the study was to evaluate the nature of glomerular diseases by analyzing clinical and laboratory data and including renal biopsy. Methods: Renal function, blood pressure, proteinuria and hematuria were assessed in 100 children and adults (mean age 15.4\u00b111.2 yrs, range 1.8 -52 yrs) admitted with edema and proteinuria at the hospital of the Medical Research Laboratories in Fajara / The Gambia. Percutaneous renal biopsy was performed locally after informed consent. Results: The main diagnosis were post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN, n=42, age 8.3\u00b16.7 yrs), FSGS (n=27, age 22\u00b111.8 yrs), MCNS (n=15, age 19.1\u00b110.5 yrs) and membranous nephritis (n=7, age 18.9\u00b19.9 yrs). Hypertension and hematuria were more prevalent in cases with PIGN whereas serum albumin was higher (34.1\u00b110.2 g/l) compared to patients with FSGS (19.8\u00b17.1 g/l), MCNS (17.3\u00b18.5 g/l) or membranous nephropathy (21.7\u00b16.7 g/l). Prednisolone treatment resulted in remission in all 9 treated patients with MCNS while 10 out of 11 treated patients with FSGS were steroid-resistant. Conclusions: The spectrum and age distribution of glomerular diseases in The Gambia is quite different from that reported in the northern hemisphere. Our data may serve to guide diagnosis and treatment for glomerular diseases in West-Africa.High Incidence of Hemolytic Uremic Sndrome in Switzerland IsAssociated with Indicators of Livestock Farming Intensity M.

Rudin, 5 R.O. von Vigier. 6 1 Children's Hospital, Lucerne, Switzerland;Objectives: Survey of age-specifi c incidence rate of childhood hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and association of Shiga-toxin associated HUS (Stx-HUS) with indicators of livestock farming intensity. Methods: Epidemiological-ecological analysis based on nationwide data through theSwiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit (1997-2003 and the national census (Swiss Federal Statistical Offi ce). Results: One hundred-fourteen cases were registered, 88% were \u22645 years old. The annual incidence rate was 1.42 (0.60-1.91) and 4.23 (1.76-6.19) per 10 5 children \u226416 and \u22645 years, respectively (P<.01). Stx-HUS was more frequent compared to non-Stx-HUS and more frequent in younger (\u22645 years) patients (P<.01). The present incidence rate in Switzerland is higher compared to data from most other national studies. Strong association was found between incidence rate of Stx-HUS and indicators of rural density (livestock breeding/ population, cattle/cultivated area), P<.05 and P<.01 in children \u226416 and \u22645 years, respectively. Conclusions: HUS is frequent in young Swiss children and is mostly associated with Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The incidence rate signifi cantly correlates with livestock farming intensity, supporting the impact of contact with animals or fecal contaminants in transmission of STEC to humans.DISCLOSURE: Neuhaus, T.J.: Stockholder, Spouse has stocks from Novartis. von Vigier, R.O.: Stockholder, Myself; stocks from GSK, Novartis & Roche. Long Term Follow up of Severe IgA Nephropathy Treated with Prednisone and Azathioprine A. Wilhelm-Bals, P. Parvex, E. Girardin.Pediatric Nephrology, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland. : IgA nepropathy (IgAN) is the most common nephritis in children. It was fi rst considered a benign condition. It is now clear that a large number progress to renal failure. The appropriate treatment is still a matter of controversy. We report 8 cases of severe IgAN treated with prednisone and azathioprine.Conclusions:The combination of AZA-prednisone showed good effi cacy in inducing remission (6/7 at 1y) and regression of histologic lesion. At last follow up, 4pts are still in remission, 3 have mild PU and 1 has CRD.Congenital Nephrotic Syndrome in New ZealandChildren, Prolonged Renal Survival without Renal Replacement Therapy W. Wong, M.C. Morris, T. Kara. Nephrology, Starship Children's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF) leads to an inexorable progression to end stage renal failure within the fi rst decade of life. Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) infants in New Zealand appear to have a different course to those with the typical Finnish mutation. The demography, clinical features and outcome of all with CNS children born in New Zealand is reviewed. Methods: All cases of CNS diagnosed between 1975 and 2009 were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical features, treatment and outcome were extracted from clinical records and contact with nephrologists. Mutation analysis was undertaken in patients born after 1995. Results: Thirty one patients with CNS were identifi ed, 21 children of Maori descent, 10 Caucasians. Age at follow up ranged from 2.5 months to 29 years. Twelve had died (6/10 Caucasians, 6/21 Maori) at 4 days to 7 months. None of the 21 Maori children received bilateral nephrectomies. Maori children with CNS had displayed a highly variable and protracted timeline to end stage renal failure with some patients developing end stage renal failure as early as 3yrs of age while other not developing chronic renal failure until their third decade of life. Mutation analysis of NPHS1 showed mutations different to classical Fin Major or Minor. Conclusions: Congenital nephrotic syndrome in New Zealand Maori children exhibit a different clinical course to Caucasian children and have mutations which are unique to this racial group. Conservative medical therapy is often successful in controlling nephrotic symptoms and promoting acceptable growth in Maori children with CNS.

Perihilar;CELLand COLL were appeared to be primary steroid resistent. COLL FSGS had the highest rate of ESRD. Conclusions: FSGS is defi ned as a clinical-pathologic syndrome. Corticoresistant nephrotic syndrome is the main manifestation. Collapsing glomerulopathy is the most aggressive variant of fsgs. GTL variant may be the best types.

IgA Nephropathy in Chinese Children, Severe or Not? Y.-H. Zhai, Q. Cao, J. Chen, X.-Y. Fang, Q. Shen, H. Xu. Department of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Objectives: To analyse the pathology of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with various clinical features in 158 Chinese children retrospectively. Methods: Children with primary IgAN were divided clinically into two groups, asymptomatic (aIgAN) and symptomatic IgAN (sIgAN). Prognosis was graded by urine protein excretion and renal function. Results: The 125 children in sIgAN were younger than that in aIgAN (8.9\u00b10.3 yr. vs. 10.5 \u00b1 0.6 yr, P<0.05). Most children (50%) clinically presented macroscopic hematuria. The urine protein excretion of children in sIgAN was more than that in aIgAN (1.8\u00b10.2. vs. 0.4\u00b10.1g/d) and the average course before renal biopsy was longer than that of sIgAN (466\u00b1115 .vs. 159\u00b140d)( P<0.01). More children in aIgAN had minor histologic lesions than those in sIgAN, manifested by lower mesangial score and less presentation of other pathologic variables (P<0.05), however, histologically severe cases in 2 groups were similar (\u223c10%). By logistic analysis, hypertension was related to the severity of histological lesions (OR:9.77, 95%CI:1.78\u223c53.62, P <0.01). Most children in both groups had good clinical outcome at >1yr of follow up and complete clinical data from 68 cases indicated hypertension related to short-term prognosis (OR:15.27, 95%CI:1.08\u223c21.84, P <0.05). Conclusions: Most in aIgAN have minor histologically lesions, but a few of them may have severe lesions. The short-term prognosis is good and hypertension is related to the severity of histologic lesions and prognosis. So monitoring blood pressure, and developing appropriate indication of renal biopsy in children with suspected IgAN may have potent signifi cance in retarding disease progress. Invasive Test for Renal Transplant Rejection in Children J. Jackson, J. Rossio, L Kean, A.Kirk. Emory, Atl, GA, United States; Life  Tech., MKE, WI, United States.   :  Noninvasive testing for renal dysfunction is critical for pediatric transplant recipients, who have a long-term need for transplant monitoring, and for whom invasive testing is problematic. We have investigated a urine-based assay for CXCL9, CXCL10, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), proteins associated with T cell based infl ammatory processes. Methods: Urine collected from pediatric healthy, non-transplanted controls and transplant patients (n=27) was analyzed. Each sample was verifi ed to be representative of a single condition: healthy control (HC, n=7), stable transplant with normal renal function (ST, n=8), acute rejection (AR, n=7), or BK nephritis (BKN, n=5).",

Zimmerhackl. Pediatrics, Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.Objectives: Transplantation in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is characterized by a high rate of disease recurrence and subsequent graft loss. Methods: Since 2001 the European Paediatric Research Group for HUS and related disorders (HUSnet) (www.hus-online.at) has been collecting data and performing complement analysis in patients with atypical STEC negative HUS. In 25 out of 135 patients of the registry 47 renal transplantations (n=1-4) were performed, including 5 patients with heterozygous factor H (fH), 1 homozygous MCP, 2 heterozygous factor I (fI), 1 combined mutation including fH and fI and 1 patient with fH antibodies and CFHR1 deletion. Results: Graft loss occurred in 33/46 transplants (72%), in median after 7 months (1 day -11.4 years). The main reasons for graft loss were HUS recurrence in 76% (25/33), followed by rejection in 5 cases (15%). Loss of function was reported in 8 of 28 grafts (29%) in the fi rst month after transplantation, in 6 cases due to disease recurrence. 16 of 28 (57%) grafts were lost within the fi rst year after renal transplantation. The follow-up time of the 13 grafts with preserved renal function is about 15 months in median (6 days -8 years).Conclusions:The data of our registry shows that graft failure due to disease recurrence occured in more than 50% in the fi rst year of transplantation.

Chronic Respiratory Symptoms and Bronchiectasis in Paediatric Renal Transplant Recipients on Mycophenolate Mofetil N.M. Dolan, R. Suri, C. Owens, S.D. Marks. Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom. : Evaluate incidence of respiratory complications,in particular bronchiectasis, in paediatric renal transplant recipients(RTR) receiving mycophenolate mofetil(MMF).Methods: Review of renal transplant database and RTR with history of chronic cough and chest signs were identifi ed.Immunosuppression used,interval from transplantation to symptom onset and associations between therapy and onset of symptoms were documented. Results: Of 143 transplant recipients,93(65%) received MMF as part of immunosuppression.11(12%) of these patients developed chronic respiratory symptoms,compared to none(0/50) on other immunosuppression(p<0.05).50 %(5/10) symptomatic patients who underwent CT scanning had radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis.Time to onset of symptoms in patients receiving MMF ranged from 9-96(mean 31;median 24)months.In asymptomatic patients,duration of therapy ranged from 1-98(mean 32;median 29) months(p>0.05).Duration of immunosuppression among patients who received non-MMF regimens ranged from 10 -170(mean 55;median 49.5)months(p<0.001).Mean 12-hour trough MPA levels in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 6.85 and 3.78 mcg/ml respectively(p<0.001).Conclusions: High incidence(12%) of signifi cant chronic respiratory symptoms related to the use of MMF.Signifi cant association between high trough MPA levels and development of symptoms.No association between duration of MMFbased,or other immunotherapy and onset of respiratory symptoms.Bronchiectasis should be considered in all patients who develop chronic respiratory symptoms post renal transplantation. Allograft Survival in Patients with Henoch-Schonlein Purpura: Analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) Database J.P. Samuel, 1 C.S. Bell, 1 D.A. Molony, 2 M.C. Braun. 1 1 Division of Pediatric Nephrology and Hypertension, UTHSC-H, Houston, TX, United States; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, UTHSC-H, Houston, TX, UnitedStates. : Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) is the most common form of renal vasculitis in childhood, however there is little data on outcomes of renal transplantation in patients with HSP. This study was designed to examine the impact of HSP on allograft survival in a well-defi ned transplant population. Methods: The UNOS database(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005) was analyzed to determine the outcomes of primary renal transplants in patients with HSP; each case was matched 1:3 with non-HSP patients and controlled for age, gender, donor source, ethnicity, and year of transplantation. Results: Of the 189,217 primary renal allografts in the UNOS database, 339 (0.18%) were in individuals with a diagnosis of HSP. Compared to the remainder of the database, the HSP group was younger (mean age at transplantation of 28.1 +/-14.9 years vs. 44.2 +/-15.4 years), had a higher proportion of females (47% female vs. 40%), live donors (50% vs. 35%), and Caucasians (77% vs. 60%). Only 97 HSP patients (28.6%) were <18 years of age at the time of transplant. Graft survival for patients with HSP was 77.0% at 5 yrs and 55.4% at 10 yrs compared to 74.6% and 47.9% in the control population (p> 0.05). Graft failure from recurrent disease was reported in 13.5% of patients with HSP, compared to 5.2% in the database as a whole.Conclusions: This study represents the largest cohort to date evaluating the outcomes of renal transplantation in HSP. While there was an increased risk of graft failure from recurrent disease, overall graft survival in patients with HSP was comparable to matched controls.

Methods: Patients who received a 1 st transplant at <21 years of age, whose data were recorded in the USRDS were included. Mortality rates were calculated for each 1-year interval after the 1 st transplant for patients observed in each of the following statuses: 1 st transplant functioning, dialysis, 2 nd transplant functioning. Patients changed status upon return to dialysis or retransplant. Age-, sex-, and race-standardized mortality ratios (SMR) relative to the general American population were calculated for each 1-year interval. Results: Of 18,911 patients with median 10.8 y follow-up, 2713 died. Mortality rates were highest in the 1st post-transplant year and after return to dialysis. SMR were quite stable after the 1st year.Conclusions: The relative risk of mortality does not increase substantially with increasing accumulated time since 1st transplant.

Pape. 1 1 Hanover Medical School, Pediatric Nephrology, Hannover, Germany; 2 Hanover Medical School, Pathology, Hannover, Germany. : Protocol biopsies (PB) are seldom performed in pediatric kidney transplantation. It is not known what factors infl uence the results.Methods: We performed PBs in 79 children 6 months after kidney transplantation (mean age at renal transplantation 10 \u00b1 5 years). PBs were evaluated using BANFF 2007-criteria by two local pathologists. The infl uence of different factors on the results was tested by co-variance analysis. Results: PB results were infl uenced by the immunosuppressive regimen in covariance analysis (p=0.045): children treated with mTOR-Inhibitor and low dose cyclosporine A (CsA) showed less borderline fi ndings (18% vs. 29%, p=0.000 ANOVA) and no subclinical rejection (0% vs. 19%) compared to patients treated with regular-dose CsA and mycofenolat mofetile. There was a tendency for less interstitial fi brosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) in younger children (8 \u00b1 5 years vs. 11 \u00b1 5, covariance analysis: p= 0.095, ANOVA: p=0.072). There was no infl uence of other factors on PBs(table 1).Conclusions:Immunosuppression with mTOR-inhibitor and low dose CsA leads to a decreased number of borderline fi ndings and subclincal rejection. In younger recipients the amount of IF/TA is slightly decreased. The infl uence on long term outcome has to be evaluated.",

The aim of this study was to assess vitamin D status in children issued from the INU23 study. Methods: Biomarkers of phosphate/calcium metabolism, among them 25 OH and 1-25 OH2 vitamins D, were measured in a prospective cohort of 227 children (119 boys, age 11\u00b14 yrs) undergoing GFR assessment (inulin clearance).",

The best approach uses spiral computed tomography scans. Ultrasound can detect translucent uric acid stones and obstruction in the urinary tract. Results: Most kidney stones pass out of the body as fl uids are increased. Twenty seven children had kidney stones and eleven had hypercalciuria. Twelve kids patients had no hematuria among the presenting symptoms, more than one third had normal urinalysis at our fi rst examination, one half had microcalculi. Conclusions: Treatment options that may be recommended if an increase in fl uid doesn't work include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, tunnel surgery, or major surgery. The lack of hematuria is not predictive of absence of urolithiasis. Investigations ruled out Williams Beurren syndrome, cystosteatonecrosis and vitamin D intoxication. Pamidronate acid did not correct hypercalcemia. Follow-up showed a serum calcium decrease (SCa : 1.45 to 1.55) associated with a dramatic decrease in UCa (U Ca/Creat 0.15 to 0.3) at D 120.Her mother also had asymptomatic hypercalcemia (SCa ++ 1.51 mmol/l) and a low urinary calcium excretion (U Ca/Creat:0;07) whereas father's dosages were normal. Molecular genetic analysis of CASR identifi ed a heterezygotous mutation (c1868G>A) for the girl and her mother. This mutation has been previously reported in FFH.High serum neonatal calcium levels can be explained by really high fetal levels, higher than mother's level,leading to neonatal hypercalciuria in spite of CASR mutation. Conclusions: In neonatal period, hypercalciuria must not exclude the hypothesis of a putative CASR mutation: molecular genetic analysis offers a valuable supplement to the clinical diagnosis of FFH in hypercalcemic neonate.Objectives: To evaluate the effects and prophylactic role of Calcium and Vitamin D on bone health in children with new onset Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) on short term high dose corticosteroid therapy. In growing children, BMC more accurately refl ects changes in the skeleton than BMD. Short term high dose steroid therapy decreases BMC of lumbar spine by 9% in children with new onset NS. Vitamin D and Calcium co-administration not only prevents the decrease in BMC but also enhances BMC of lumbar spine.Bone Mineral Disorders in Pediatric Renal TransplantionA. Derakhshan, A.

Conclusions: Longitudinal studies with large size samples are needed to clarify the contributing factors with intima -media thickness in ESRD children.Objectives: Williams syndrome (WS) is a complex developmental disorder characterized by congenital cardiovascular disease, dysmorphic facies, mental retardation and infantile hypercalcemia. WS is due to microdeletion of chromosome 7q11.23 involving elastin gene and 25 others. Cardiac involvement is well known and often requires intervention in childhood. High blood pressure (HBP) is seen in 50% of patients, even in the absence of cardiac malformations, and goes often underdiagnosed. Methods: We have evaluated a total cohort of 47 WS patients. In order to study their cardiovascular system, we have performed 41 ambulatory blood presssure monitoring (ABPM), 44 echocardiogram, 27 systemic vascular doppler ultrasound and 15 angioTC of the abnormal vascular lesions detected by ultrasound. Results: We have found 29/41 abnormal ABPM. It has been diagnostic of HBP in 18 patients and has detected a loss of the nocturnal dip in 25 patients. The echocardiogram study has detected a total of 31/44 abnormalities, being the most frequent fi nding the supravalvar aortic stenosis (19) and defi ning surgery in 4 patients. Doppler ultrasound detected abnormalities (14/27) including infradiaphragmatic aortic narrowing and accelerated arterial fl ows in carotid, renal and abdominal branches. The angioTC performed confi rmed the lesions showing midaortic diffuse narrowing and stenosis of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteria. Conclusions: We described new vascular lessions in WS as cause of HBP that consist of the narrowing of the infradiaphragmatic aorta and some visceral branches.The Correlation between Atherosclerosis Risk Factors and CarotidIntima Media Thickness in Children with Nephrotic Syndrome N.

Methods: Thirty one children(22M,mean age 9yr) with history of nephrotic syndrome were enrolled into the study between 2008 and 2009. The inclusion criteria were: Idiopathic NS with normal serum complement, being at least one year on therapy,GFR>90ml/min/1.73m 2 ,Age>2 year at the time of study. Consent was taken from parents or patient. Fasting blood sample was drawn and 24 hour urine was collected. Carotid intima -media thickness (cIMT), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were studied in all children.P<0.05 was considered signifi cant. Results: Nine out of 31 patients was steroid responsive. The mean cIMT (mm) was 0.45(\u00b1 0.16) compared to 0.43(\u00b10.1) in control group (P >0.0.05). There was no correlation between cIMT and serum homocystein, vitamin B12, and folic acid level neither in frequent nor infrequent relapses(P>0.05). Patients who received cyclosporine had signifi cantly higher cIMT (0.5 vs 0.42 mm) (P=0.042), LVMI(42 vs 47 gr/m 2/ /ht 2.7 ), and lower vitamin B12 level (341vs 535 pg/ml) (P=0.02).

W\u00fchl, 3 B. Schmidt, 2 A.Melk. 1    Objectives: Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is an estimate of aortic stiffnes. This study compares aPWV values of young individuals measured by applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor) and with a new oscillometric device (Vicorder). Methods: aPWV in 131 healthy children (age 6-18 years) was measured 1. by sequential tonometry and 2. by oscillometry in a synchronic manner. SphygmoCor aPWV was calculated with distance 1 (dist.1) [=(Suprasternal notch(SSN) to Umbilicus(Umb))+(Umb to A.fem.)-(SSN to A.car.)]. For Vicorder 3 additional distances were used: dist.2 [=(SSN to Umb)+(Umb to A.fem.)]; dist.3 [=SSN to A.fem.]; dist.4 [=(SSN to A.fem.)-(SSN to A.car.)]. Results: Mean SphygmoCor aPWV was 4.9\u00b10.6 m/s. Vicorder aPWV were 4.6\u00b10.6 m/s (dist.1; r=.46 for correlation with Sphygmocor; p<.0001); 5.3\u00b10.7 m/s (dist.2; r=.44; p<.0001); 5.2\u00b10.7 m/s (dist.3; r=.45; p<.0001); 4.6\u00b10.6 m/s (dist.4; r=.46; p<.0001). Using dist.1, the lowest deviation was seen (11.3\u00b18.1%).Conclusions:The variability between both methods is well acceptable using dist.1. Since the Vicorder is easier to handle, needs less operator training and measurements are done more quickly, it seems the appropriate device for larger cohort studies.Low-Molecular Weight Adiponectin Is Associated with LeftVentricular Mass Index M. Lo, 1 S. Furth, 2 B. Warady, 3 M. Mitsnefes. 1 1 Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, United States; 2 CKiD Investigator, Philadelphia, PA, United States; 3 CKiD Investigator, Kansas City, MS, United States. : The mechanisms of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in children with CKD are not fully understood. The known risk factors account for only 15-44% of variability in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in pediatric studies.We investigated the associations of LVMI with adiponectin, an adipokine known to be cardioprotective. Methods: We determined total adiponectin and its sub-fractions (high-molecular weight (HMW), low-molecular weight (LMW), and trimer) cross-sectionally in a sub-cohort of patients from the CKiD study (n=82). Echocardiograms were obtained using a standardized protocol at local sites and read centrally. Uni-and multi-variate linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationships between LVMI and adiponectin and other risk factors of interest including BP.Results: Mean age 12.3\u00b13.5 years; 56% male; mean iGFR (iohexol) 45.3\u00b117.4 mL/min/1.73m 2 . Mean total adiponectin level was 17.2\u00b16.4mcg/mL. Mean adiponectin sub-fractions were HMW 43.2\u00b113.1%, LMW 34.9\u00b17.9%, trimer 21.8\u00b110.3%. Conclusions: This study is the fi rst characterization of adiponectin sub-fractions on intermediate cardiovascular outcome (LVMI) in CKD. Despite a higher total adiponectin level, decreased LMW fraction predicts a higher LVMI in the CKiD population. This effect was independent after adjustment for BMI, age, and casual BP.

In contrast, LMW was associated with iGFR (0.12, 0.03 to 0.20, p=0.004) and was higher for pubertal vs pre-pubertal children (4.24, 1.34 to 7.14, p=0.005).Conclusions:The increase in total adiponectin levels with progressive CKD is associated with decreasing percentages of the LMW fraction after adjusting for all other signifi cant predictors. This imbalance in subfractions may be important for increased CV risk despite higher levels of total adiponectin in children with CKD.Blood Pressure Association with Insulin Resistance and Adipokines in Obese Children and AdolescentsS.

Pediatrics, Maimonides Infants and  Children's Hospital, Brooklyn, NY, United  States.:  To determine whether systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability affects left ventricular mass in children with hypertension (HT), prehypertension(preHT)   and white coat hypertension (wcHT).Methods: BP variability was assessed by mean 24 hour SBP standard deviation (SD), daytime SBP SD and night time SBP SD. Left ventricular mass assessed by echocardiogram was used to calculate left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Differences in age and BMI z-scores were assessed by one way ANOVA. Correlation between LVMI and each SBP SD was assessed by linear regression analysis. Results: Eighty-seven untreated children (6-19 years) underwent ambulatory BP monitoring. There were no differences in mean age(14.6+3, 14.2+3.8 and  13.5+3.3, p=0.41)  or BMI z-scores (1.55+0.91, 1.77+0.76 and 1.74+0.76, p=0.62) among HT, preHT and wcHT groups.In HT group, LVMI had a signifi cant (p=0.007) positive correlation (r=0.58) with night SBP SD, but no signifi cant correlation with day or 24 hr SBP SD. In preHT and wcHT groups, there were no signifi cant correlations. Conclusions: In HT children, higher night SBP variability is associated with increased left ventricular mass.Renal Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) Is Unlikely To Be Familial andIs Not Caused by Smooth Muscle Alpha Actin (ACTA2) Mutations S.D. Marks, A.M. Gullett, K. Tullus, R. Kleta, A.S. Woolf. Department of Paediatric Nephrology, UCL Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, England, United Kingdom. : ACTA2 mutations have recently been reported in muscular malformations of extra-renal arteries.We investigated blood pressures (BP) of fi rstdegree relatives of a cohort of non-syndromic FMD index cases and sought ACTA2 mutations by sequencing all exons. Methods: Leucocyte DNA was obtained from index cases and ACTA2 sequenced. BP of fi rst degree relatives were measured using standard devices and, when indicated, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed. Results: Thirteen unrelated index cases (62% female, 85% Caucasian) aged 2 -32 (median 15) years were recruited. There were 40 fi rst-degree relatives comprising 22 (55% mothers) parents aged 28 -58 (median 44) years and 18 (55% male) siblings aged 3 -30 (median 13) years, including two consanguineous families. Hypertension was evident in 27% of parents from different families (fi ve [80% male] were on anti-hypertensive medications, with one mother discovered to be hypertensive by BP measurement and subsequent ABPM). All eight adult siblings were normotensive. Of the ten screened siblings aged <18 years, one female teenager was pre-hypertensive (90-95 th centile), and the remainder were normotensive. No ACTA2 mutations were found in index cases. Conclusions: Hypertension occurs in 25% of the general adult population, so the incidence of hypertension in parents of index cases was unremarkable. Familial cases of FMD are rare although none of the hypertensive parents have had renal angiography. ACTA2 mutations were not responsible for FMD in our cohort.Decrease of Visceral Fat Determines Regression of Target Organ Damage in Boys with Primary HypertensionA. Niemirska, 1 R. Janas, 1 E. Jurkiewicz, 1 J. Feber, 2 M. Litwin. 1 1 The Children's Memorial Health Institute, Warsaw, Poland; 2 University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada. : The main intermediate phenotype of primary hypertension(PH)  in adolescents is obesity and metabolic abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that lowering of blood pressure (BP) and target organ damage (TOD) regression correlates with the decrease of visceral fat (VAT) in hypertensive boys. Methods: 24h ambulatory BP and TOD were evaluated in 50 boys (13.6 \u00b12.5 yrs) with PH before and after 12 months of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. TOD was assessed by left ventricular mass index (LVMi) and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT). Fat distribution was determined as waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and by magnetic resonance as subcutaneous fat, VAT, intraperitoneal VAT, and deep subcutaneous fat. Results: Pts in whom BP lowered (n = 28) and pts with no change of BP differed only in intraperitoneal VAT decrease (-480 \u00b1766 vs -93 \u00b1478 mm 2 ; p = 0.04). In pts in whom cIMT decreased (n=32) serum leptin also decreased (-16.2 \u00b121.6 vs -3.0 \u00b11.6 ng/ml; p = 0.01) and groups did not differ regarding changes in BP, anthropometrical and biochemical variables. In 30 pts in whom LVMi decreased WC and WHR also decreased. 24h mean arterial BP decrease was predicted by the decrease of BMI (b = 0.458), WC (b = 0.653) and increase in adiponectin (b = -0.330; R 2 = 0.9; p = 0.0001). LVMi regression was predicted by the decrease of WHR (b = 0.709; p = 0.04; R 2 = 0.42).Conclusions:In hypertensive boys the decrease of BP and regression of TOD are predicted by the decrease of visceral obesity.DISCLOSURE: Niemirska, A.: Grant/Research Support, Clinical Study.

Paripovic, M. Kostic, B. Spasojevic, D. Kruscic, A. Peco-Antic. Nephrology Department, University Children's Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia. : Our aim was to access the ability of offi ce blood pressure (OBP) to predict hypertension in pediatric kidney transplants. Methods: Study population consisted of 39 kidney transplant recipients (24 males) with stable functioning renal graft aged 6-20 years. Median age after transplantation was 14.5 years. OBP was performed at three different occasions and average value was used for further analysis. Offi ce hypertension was defi ned when indexed offi ce systolic and/or diastolic BP was \u2265 1. Ambulatory hypertension was defi ned as mean systolic or diastolic BP index at day-time \u2265 1 or BP load \u2265 25% and with appropriate values (mean 24h systolic BP \u2265 135 mmHg and mean 24h diastolic BP \u2265 85 mmHg) for those over 18 years. Kappa coeffi cient and receiver operator curve (ROC) were used to compare diagnostic effi cacy of OBP and ABPM. Results: Hypertension was detected in 44% of patients with CBP and in 62% with ABPM. Kappa coeffi cient (0.352) revealed a mild agreement between OBP and ABPM. The sensitivity and specifi city of the OBP to predict hypertension were 58% and 80%. Diastolic OBP was a better predictor of ambulatory hypertension (ROC area under the curve (AUC) = 0.76 \u00b1 0.08) than systolic OBP (AUC = 0.61 \u00b1 0.09). Conclusions: OBP often fails to detect hypertension in patients with kidney transplants. It is very important to perform regular ABPM in order to detect hypertension.Risk Factors for Chronic Renal Disease in a Cohort of Pediatric Hypertensive Patients with NephropathiesR.M.

Simoes e Silva. 2Hospital Foundation of Minas Gerais -FHEMIG, Belo Horizonte, Minas Geria, Brazil; 2 Pediatrics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, BeloHorizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. : The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for chronic renal disease (CRD) in a cohort of pediatric hypertensive patients with nephropathies. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, the records of 134 patients diagnosed with arterial hypertension due to renal diseases were included. These patients were followed at our Unit between 1994 and 2009. A data base was used for statistical analysis and patients were divided according to the development or not of CRD. Results: A total of 21 patients (15.6%) among 134 developed CRD during a follow-up of 8.4\u00b12.5 years. No differences were obtained in sex, race, age, etiology of renal disease, body weight, stature and mass index in the comparison between patients with versus without CRD. Blood pressure levels at admission was also similar in both groups, however the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained signifi cantly higher in patients that developed CRD. Despite similar at admission, serum creatinine levels progressively elevated in CRD group (3.8\u00b12.8 vs. 0.6\u00b10.2mg/dL). The frequency of target-organ injury was signifi cantly higher in CRD group (43% vs. 9%). The logistic regression model showed that the elevation of serum creatinine, the persistence of hypertension and the presence of target-organ injury signifi cantly and independently contributed to the development of CRD. Conclusions: Our results were in accordance with the literature and showed the importance to evaluate pediatric hypertensive series.Vitamin-D-Induced Calcifi cation in Uremic Rats: Effect of Cinacalcet (CINA) and Parathyroidectomy (PTX) S. Jung, 1 D. M\u00fcller, 1 S. Kr\u00e4mer, 2 H. Peters, 2 U. Querfeld. 1 1 Pediatric Nephrology, Charit\u00e9, Berlin, Germany; 2 Nephrology, Charit\u00e9, Berlin, Germany. : Both calcitriol and PTH are involved in the pathogenesis of vascular calcifi cations. We have studied the question to what extent vascular calcifi cations induced by high-dose calcitriol treatment can be prevented by parathyroidectomy (PTX) and cinacalcet (CINA) in a rat model of uremia (5/6 nephrectomy).Methods: 5 groups of animals were studied: sham-operated (CON), uremic (U), uremic + calcitriol (U+vitD), uremic+calcitriol+PTX (U+vitD+PTX), uremic+calcitriol+CINA (U+vitD+CINA). Results: PTH was signifi cantly lower in U+D rats compared to U rats, and further suppressed to a similar degree in animals treated with PTX or CINA. The serum calcium-phosphate product was elevated in all groups receiving calcitriol, without a signifi cant difference between groups. Growth and weight gain was not suppressed in the U+vitD+CINA group.Vascular calcifi cations (%area of aortic wall) were not seen in CON and U animals, present (>20%) in U+vitD animals, and reduced to a similar degree (<10%) in both the U+vitD+PTX and the U+vitD+CINA group. In calcifi ed aortas, the presence of chondrocytic cells, positive staining for chondrocyte matrix, collagen X and the transcription factor sox9 indicated endochondral bone formation in calcitriol-treated rats. Conclusions: In uremic rats, CINA attenuates vitamin D-induced calcifi cation; it has no suppressive effect on growth after 3 months of treatment. Neither CINA nor PTX can completely prevent vitamin-D induced calcifi cation. Calcifi cation resembling endochondral bone formation occurs by direct vascular effects of calcitriol, independent of serum calcium and serum phosphorus concentrations.Dyslipidemia in Chronic KidneyDisease J. Saland, 1 L. Satlin, 1 H. Ginsberg. 2 1 Pediatrics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States; 2 Medicine, Columbia U College of Physicians & Surgeons, New York, NY, United States.:  We hypothesized increasing degree of CKD is associated with impaired post-prandial triglyceride (TG) clearance. Methods: A high-fat meal was provided to non-nephrotic subjects with CKD. TG area under the curve (AUC) over the next 8 hours was the measure of TG catabolic capacity. The hypothesis was tested by correlation to estimated GFR (eGFR) and urine protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR). Results: 17 subjects with eGFR 12 to 173 ml/min/1.73m 2 participated. AUC was inversely correlated to eGFR (R 2 =0.39) to about the same extent as fasting TG (R 2 =0.43), both p<0.01. Univariate predictors of AUC were younger age (R 2 =0.43), greater proteinuria (R 2 =0.47) and lower serum albumin (Alb) (R 2 =0.47), all p<0.01. The best 2-variable models predicting AUC were a) eGFR and Alb (R 2 =0.66) b) uPCR and Alb (R 2 =0.64), and c) age and Alb (R 2 =0.79), all p<0.01. In each model, both variables were signifi cant after adjustment for the other. Limited multivariable analysis suggested no improvement with >2 variables. While fasting TG was a dominant predictor (R 2 =0.80, p<0.01) of AUC, AUC of TG excursion above the fasting level was also associated with the same variables and models (all p\u22640.01). TG measured early (\u22644 hours), but not later (\u22656 hours) was associated with CKD variables to about the same extent as fasting TG. Conclusions: Increasing degree of CKD and albumin variation within the normal range are independently associated with impaired post-prandial TG clearance. Overlapping or linked mechanisms contribute to fasting and post-prandial hypertriglyceridemia. Pending analysis of stored samples may discern effects of potential modulators such as insulin and ApoC-III.DISCLOSURE: Ginsberg, H.: Grant/Research Support, Merck, Roche, AstraZeneca, Isis/Genzyme; Consultant, Merck, Aboot, Roche, AstraZeneca, BMS, Isis/Genzyme, Glaxosmithkline, Pfi zer, Regeneron/Sanofi -Aventis; Speaker's Bureau, Pfi zer; Other, Advisory Board: Merck/Schering Plugh, BMS/AstraZeneca.

Methods: Individuoals between 5 and 15 years of age were evaluated. Exclusion criteria: arm circumference >30 cm, diagnosis of secondary hypertension. A validated oscillometric method was used for the ambulatory BP measurements (SPACELABS 90207). Individuals with a BMI percentile \u226585 were divided into groups, according to cut-off points for WC. One group presented with a normal WC and the other with an increased WC. Results: The study evaluated 46 children and adolescents with excess weight (9.09\u00b12.89 years, 58.7% males and 58.6% non white). When comparing individuals from the normal WC and increased WC groups, no differences were found regarding weight, height, BMI, awake BP (p>0.05). Individuals with increased WC had higher night systolic BP (p=0.130) and diastolic BP (p=0.039) and smaller dipping (%) in systolic (p=0.003) and diastolic (p=0.0026) BP during sleep period. Conclusions: In overweight children and adolescents, increased waist circumference is associated to a higher diastolic BP during sleep and lower night dipping of the systolic BP and diastolic BP. These changes in BP could be another marker for cardiovascular risk, in addition to the excess weight associated to an increased waist circumference.Cardiovascular Morbidity in Dutch Children with ESRD N.J. Schoenmaker, 1 I.M. Kuipers, 2 J.H. van der Lee, 3 J.W. Groothoff, 1 on behalf of the RICH-Q working group. 1 Paediatric Nephrology, AMC/ EKZ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 2 Paediatric Cardiology, AMC/EKZ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 3 Paediatric Clinical Epidemiology, AMC/EKZ, Amsterdam, Netherlands. : Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) since childhood. The RICH-Q study is a collaborative project in which all Dutch centres that provide paediatric chronic Renal Replacement Therapy (cRRT) collaborate to improve the quality of care. Here we report on factors associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Methods: All dialysis and transplanted Dutch patients aged <19 years between August 2007 and 2010 were included. Cardiovascular indicators like blood pressure, serum hemoglobin, phosphate and PTH were assessed every 3 months. Echocardiograms were performed once and were assessed by 2 observers centrally. Results: 92 children were included. LVH was diagnosed in 20 children (22%). In 75%, LVH was asymmetrical septal. No signifi cant differences were found in age, (median [range] age 15 [1-19] vs. 12 [0-18] years), duration of cRRT (median [range] duration of 2 [0-15] vs. 1 [0-15] years), gender, BMI, blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, serum hemoglobin, phosphate, PTH or treatment modality. The fi rst cRRT of the children with LVH vs. non LVH had been hemodialysis (HD) in 35% vs. 42%, peritoneal dialysis (PD) in 55% vs. 47% and transplantation (Tx) in 10% vs. 11%. The cRRT at time of the echocardiogram for LVH vs. non LVH was HD in 25% vs. 21%, PD in 45% vs.28% and Tx in 30% vs. 51%. Conclusions: LVH, mostly asymmetrical septal LVH, is seen in 22% of the children with cRRT. This is considered to be a result of chronic volume overload. Agreement between Cardiologists Diagnosing LVH in Children with ESRD Is Low N.J. Schoenmaker, 1 I.M. Kuipers, 2 J.H. van der Lee, 3 J.W. Groothoff. 1 1 Paediatric Nephrology, EKZ/AMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Paediatric Cardiology, EKZ/AMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 3 Paediatric Clinical Epidemiology, EKZ/AMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands.: Early detection and therapeutic intervention of cardiovascular disease is considered to be essential in children with end stage renal disease (ESRD) in order to prevent mortality in early adulthood. Early signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) include interventricular septal (IVS) and posterior wall (PW) hypertrophy. The incidence of LVH appears to differ between different centres. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between different observers of echocardiography with respect to the diagnosis of LVH. Methods: We reviewed the echocardiograms, made by cardiologists from 4 different centres between August 2007 and 2010, of children aged 0-18 years with ESRD. Digital images that had already been analyzed at each centre were stored and analyzed offl ine by two independent observers. Kappa was calculated for 3 pairs of observers. Results: In total 92 echocardiograms were reviewed. The cardiologists from the different centres diagnosed LVH in 28 children (30%), observer 1 in 20 children (22%), and observer 2 in 27 children (29%). All observers agreed on 8 children (9%) diagnosed with LVH, and on 46 children (50%) without LVH. Kappa ranged from 0.2-0.4, which is considered low. Conclusions: There is limited agreement between cardiologists about the diagnosis of LVH in children with ESRD based on a single echocardiography. Research is needed to evaluate the use of repeated measurements over time.The Early Cardiovascular Risk Markers in Primary HypertensiveChildren B. Sozeri, 1 O.D. Kara, 1 N. Dincel, 1 M. Deveci, 2 S. Mir. 1 1 Pediatric Nephology, Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey; 2 Pediatic Cardiology, Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey. : Hypertension impacts the vascular wall. Vascular morphology and function such as carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the pulse wave augmentation index (AIx) have been established as valid surrogate markers of arteriopathy in adults. We aimed to investigate these markers in vascular system showing cardiovascular damage before symptomatic period in hypertensive children. Methods: Thirty-eight patients(28 male, 10 female) with primary hypertension and 15 healthy children were studied. cIMT(morphologic) was measured by 2-D ultrasonography. Radial and femoral PWV and AIx(functional ) were also investigated by vicorder system. Results: The mean age was 12.7\u00b1 3.46 years. 20 of 38 patients were obese(BMI>  26.8). cIMTwas higher in patients(0.46 \u00b10.06 mm vs 0.35 \u00b1 0.12 mm, respectively, P =0,01). Femoral PWV was higher in patients (5.7 \u00b1 0.87 m/s, 4.1 \u00b1 0.72 m/s, P =0.01). AIx was higher in patients(83.3 \u00b1 6.6%,72.8 \u00b1 7.4%,P =0.04).",

Conclusions: We found no signifi cant differences of arterial stiffness between normotensive and hypertensive children. Nevertheless, we believe that with increasing size of studied population the difference would become more signifi cant.Melatonin Protects Hypertension and ADMA Accumulation inYoung Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats Y.-L. Tain, 1,2 L.-T. Huang, 1,2 J.-F. Hong, 1,2 I.-C. Lin. 1,2 1 Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; 2 Chang Gung University, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. :Hypertension (HTN)  is the major risk factor for the development of kidney disease. We investigated whether increased asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA, a NOS inhibitor) is involved in the development of HTN and melatonin can prevent it. Methods: Using spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR), a genetically hypertensive model, four groups (N=6/group) of 4-week-old SHR and their control WKY rats were sacrifi ced after 8-week treatment: Group 1, SHR without treatment; Group 2, SHR received 0.01% melatonin in drinking water (SHR+M); Group 3, WKY; and Group 4, WKY+M. ADMA levels and ADMA-related enzymes were determined. Results: At 12 weeks of age, SBP of SHR were signifi cantly higher than those in age-matched WKY rats (197\u00b14 vs 157\u00b13 mmHg), which were prevented by melatonin therapy (165\u00b15 mmHg). We found plasma ADMA levels were higher in SHR than those in WKY from 4 wk (0.88\u00b10.06 vs 0.66\u00b10.01\u00b5M) to 12 wk of age (1.00\u00b10.04 vs 0.63\u00b10.03\u00b5M, P<0.05). In contrast, plasma L-arginine to ADMA ratio (AAR) was signifi cantly decreased in SHR vs WKY at 4wk (153\u00b117 vs 201\u00b113\u00b5M/\u00b5M) and 12 wk of age (105\u00b13 vs 199\u00b18\u00b5M/\u00b5M). Increased ADMA concentrations in 12 wk-old SHR were prevented by melatonin (0.74\u00b10.01\u00b5M), while melatonin signifi cantly increased AAR (168\u00b16\u00b5M/\u00b5M). In addition, data regarding ADMA-related enzymes in the kidney will be analyzed and presented. Conclusions: High levels of ADMA precede hypertension. At 12 wk of age, SHR rats developed hypertension, and this was associated with increased ADMA and decreased AAR. Melatonin might decrease ADMA and restore AAR to prevent hypertension in young SHR rats.Arterial Structure and Function in Pediatric Dialysis and TransplantPatients H.K. Tawadrous, 1 K. Haroon, 2 A. Mongia, 1 L. Salciccioli, 2 M.J. Schoeneman, 1 J.Lazar. 2 1 Pediatric Nephrology, SUNY Downstate Medical  Center, Brooklyn, NY, United States; 2 Cardiology, SUNY Downstate  Medical Center, Brookly, NY, United States.   :  Higher augmentation index (AI), greater carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and endothelial dysfunction are present in patients (pts) with end stage renal disease and are predictive of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This is the fi rst study whose objective was to compare these three indices of arterial integrity in children on dialysis(D) and after renal transplant ( Tx). Methods: We studied 29 pts: 15 on D, 14 transplanted: 6 living related (LR) and 8 deceased donor ( DD), 15 healthy age, gender and ethnicity matched controls (C). CIMT and artery fl ow-mediated increase in arterial diameter (FMD) were measured by high-resolution ultrasound, augmentation index (AI) by applanation tonometry. Mean values between groups were compared using pairwise comparisons. Results: AI (16\u00b112, 6\u00b111, 5\u00b110) and CIMT (0.5\u00b10.05, 0.49\u00b10.05, 0.46\u00b10.02) were signifi cantly higher in the D group than in the Tx and C group (both p< 0.05). FMD was lower in D pts than tx and C (9 \u00b14, 11\u00b14, 17 \u00b1 5, p<0.002). CIMT and AI were similar between Tx and C. However, FMD remained lower in Tx vs C, p<0.001. Among the Tx group, AI was signifi cantly lower in LRD than DDRT p=0.03and was signifi cantly correlated with Hgb level (r= -0.35, p=0.05). There were no signifi cant correlations between CIMT, AI, and FMD and the duration of D or time after Tx. Conclusions: Pediatric Tx pts have fewer arterial abnormalities than D pts. While CIMT and AI were similar to C, FMD remained signifi cantly impaired in Tx pts. LR may confer a more favorable arterial profi le than DD.Life Style Modifications (LSM) Have Limited Efficacy on Improvement of Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular (CVD) Risk Factors in Children with HypertensionH.K. Tawadrous, S. Mongia, R. Gorgy, M. Schoeneman, A.K. Mongia. Pediatric Nephrology, SUNY DOwnstate Medical Center, Broklyn, NY, United States. : Evidence of LSM for blood pressure (BP) reduction in children is limited.We determined effect on BP and CVD risk factors in children with HTN who received LSM alone or with medication. Methods: Retrospective review, 87pts with new-onset HTN from July 02toOct09. Pts recieved LSM and medications were added in Stg1and 2HTN as needed. We used paired t-test to evaluate changes in each group in respect to BP, BMI, Chol, LDL, TG, HDL and microalbumin MA. Results: Mean follow up was 2.1 ys.66% boys,83% AA, 51% were overweight.18% had pre hypertension (PH),38% stage 1 and 44% stg 2 HTN. At baseline, PH, stg 1and stg 2 HTN did not differ signifi cantly as per age, sex, race, BMI, LDL,Chol, TG, HDL and MA. There was a signifi cant improvement of systolic BP(SBP) in stg1and SBP and diastolic BP(DBP) in stg 2.Both SBP and DBP increased in pts with PH(Table). There was no signifi cant improvement in, BMI, MA, Chol, LDL, TG, and HDL in any of the groups. \u00b114.17 127.63 \u00b113.79 <.0001 81.13 \u00b112.98 74.94 \u00b19.26 0.0293Conclusions: LSM may not be adhered to intensely, may not be practical and may be inffective in children.

Stadermann, 1 G. Montini, 1 G. Hamilton, 3 D.J. Roebuck, 2 C.A. Mclaren, 2 M.J. Dillon, 1 S.D. Marks, 1 K. Tullus. 1 1 Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street for Children NHS trust, London, United Kingdom; 2 Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS trust, London, United Kingdom; 3 Vascular Surgery, Royal Free Hospital, London, United Kingdom.:  We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent surgery as part of the treatment of renovascular hypertension (RVH) at our centre between 1979 and 2008. Methods: Thirty-seven children (65% male) with a median age of 7.6 (0.4-17.9) years were identifi ed with a median systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 (105-300) mm Hg prior to surgery. Bilateral renal artery stenosis and intra-renal disease were present in 19 (51%) patients, mid-aortic syndrome in 15 (40%) and coexisting cerebral disease in eight out of 30 (26%) investigated patients. There were no perioperative deaths; two children died during followup. The SBP post-surgery improved to a median value of 116 (range 90-160) mm Hg. Twelve months after surgery, 16 (43%) children had normal blood pressure without treatment, 15 (41%) normal or improved on one to four antihypertensive drugs and four (11%) unchanged. Conclusions: Surgery effectively treated the hypertension of 90% of our children, when performed in conjunction with medical therapy and interventional radiology. In spite of aggressive surgical treatment, RVH is sometimes a progressive disease.Is Solitary Kidney a Condition at Risk for Hypertension? a Follow up Study in a PediatricPopulation P.G. Vercelloni, E. Meregalli, A. Edefonti, M. Castellon, G. Marra. Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Fondazione Ca'Granda, Milano, Italy. : Assessment of hypertensive risk in a population of children with congenital solitary kidney (SK) followed perspectively for 20 years.Methods:We compared a population of 42 pts with SK with a control group (CK) of 46 pts with congenital uropathy (mild vescico-ureteral refl ux, hydronephrosis) all with normal renal size and function. The groups were selected from a wide population of pts with congenital uropathy according to the following criteria: normal renal parenchyma as stated by US and renal scan, creatinine cl > 90 ml/min/1,73 mq, follow up longer than ten years. Age, BMI,proteinuria,sex,creatinine were comparable in the two groups. Blood pressure was measured at every visit and ABPM every 4 years or more often in case of hypertension. Results: The percentage of hypertensive children was signifi cantly higher in the SK than CK( 16.7 vs 6.5%; p-value 0,043 with \u03c7 sq test). All ABPM indices expressed as SD, except one,were signifi cantly higher in the SK pts than in CK was signifi cantly higher in the SK group.Conclusions: Solitary kidney represents a condition at risk for developing hypertension since childhood. Therefore blood pressure monitoring is mandatory in this population.Blood Pressure in Juvenile Systemic Lupus ErythematosusChanges with Overall Disease Activity L Watson, 1 C. Jones, 2 R.C.L. Holt, 2 M.W. Beresford. 1 1 Institute of Child Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; 2 Paediatric Nephrology, AlderHey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom. : Juvenile-onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (JSLE) is a chronic autoimmune condition affecting children less than 17 years. A high proportion of children develop renal involvement [1].Hypertension is linked to a worse renal prognosis[2]. We aimed to determine how systemic blood pressure changes with disease activity in JSLE.Methods: Patients with JSLE, treated at Alder Hey Children's NHS FoundationTrust Hospital (2000-2009 were included. Informed consent and ethical approval was obtained. Standardised data forms were used to collect demographic and laboratory parameters. Blood pressure (BP) was converted to a standard deviation score (SDS)[3]. Renal parameters included GFR, urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), renal biopsy fi ndings and medication. An overall BILAG score and a renal BILAG category for each clinical episode was produced[4]. Results: Thirty children were recruited; 281 clinical episodes were captured. 10 were male. Median age 13.3 years (range 3.7-17.9). 73% were Caucasian. 21 episodes were hypertensive. BP SD scores correlated with overall disease activity (BILAG score), p=0.042; renal BILAG, p<0.01; corticosteroid dose (mg/ kg), p=0.048 and if a renal biopsy had been performed, p=0.008. BP SDS didn't correlate with UACR. Conclusions: Changes in blood pressure in JSLE are related to overall disease activity together with corticosteroid dose.The effect of systemic vascular infl ammation, renal involvement and corticosteroid use may all be contributing to changes in blood pressure. Separating these variables may prove complex.Prevalence of Prehypertension and Hypertension in an AsianPediatric Population C.-M. Quek, 1 D.T. Bautista, 2 E.S. Chan, 2 I.D. Liu, 1 H.K. Yap. 1Pediatrics, YongLoo Lin School of Medicine, National University Health  System, Singapore, Singapore;2 Singapore Clinical Research Institute, Singapore, Singapore. : Pediatric blood pressure (BP) norms vary in different populations and are yet to be established in multi-ethnic Singapore, comprising 74.7% Chinese, 13.6% Malay and 8.9% Indian. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to establish offi ce BP norms in healthy Singapore school children. BP readings were measured following a standard protocol in 9936 children aged 6-19 years using the mercury sphygmomanometer, and the second and third readings for each child were analyzed. Blood pressure norms were constructed from a subset of children (n=7824, 3725 boys and 4099 girls) with normal weight, using restricted cubic spline quantile regression. Children with medical conditions or on drugs that could affect BP were excluded (n=84). BP normograms were established according to sex, age and height percentiles, based on international defi nitions for weight and height categories. Results: The percentage of prehypertensive and hypertensive children by weight category is shown in the table below.Based on our normograms, overweight or obese children were 1.5 times more likely to be pre-hypertensive (relative risk 95% CI: 1.28, 1.65) and 1.7 times more likely to be hypertensive (relative risk 95% CI: 1.54, 1.97) than children with normal weight. Conclusions: There is a fairly high proportion of prehypertensive and hypertensive children in our multi-ethnic population, and this risk increases signifi cantly if the child is overweight. echocardiography and left ventricular hyperthrophy (LVH) was defi ned as LVMI >95 th percentile. Aortic PWV was determined by applanation tonometry. We used recently produced data of PWV by age from normal population to defi ne abnormal PWV (ie >95% confi dence interval). Results: The prevalence of LVH and increased PWV was 43% and 48%, respectively. Subjects with increased PWV had higher LVMI (42.09\u00b112.02 vs 33.79\u00b17.86, p<0.01) and blood pressure (BP) than those with normal PWV. Similarly, children with LVH had greater PWV (6.0\u00b10.99 vs 4.99\u00b11.48, p<0.05) and BP than those without LVH. Higher PWV (p<0.001) and LVMI (p<0.01) were found in hypertensive children as compared to subjects with normal BP. PWV was positively correlated with BP and LVMI, while LVMI was associated with: height-SDS, BP, calcium, phosphorus, TG, HDL and PWV. After adjustment for all the above variables, diastolic BP (\u03b2=0.76) remained the only signifi cant predictor for PWV and calcium (\u03b2=-0.42) and PWV (\u03b2=0.36) for LVMI. Conclusions: These fi ndings indicate that aortic stiffness measured by PWV could serve as an additional marker of increased cardiovascular risk in children with CKD.DISCLOSURE: Zaniew, M.: Other, Subinvestigator in Clinical Trial -Salary.

Gretz, 3 D.Haffner. 1 1 Department of Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Medical Informatics and Biometry, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; 3 Medical Research Center Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.:  To elucidate the therapeutic potential of sirolimus in PCK rats, an orthologous model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Methods: Weaned PCK-and SD rats (n=85 and 72) received drinking water without and with sirolimus (corresponding to a daily intake of 2 mg/kg body weight) for 4, 8, and 12 weeks, respectively. Renal and hepatic functions were monitored and both organs were investigated morphologically (fi brosis, number & size of cysts) and immunohistochemically (expression of Akt, mTOR, and S6K). Results: Five out of 43 sirolimus treated PCK rats but none of the controls died during the study. Weight gain was slightly reduced in sirolimus treated rats. In PCK rats, grossly enlarged kidney and livers, hepatic fi brosis and enlarged bile ducts were noted. Whereas activation of Akt/mTOR signaling was hardly detectable in the kidneys of SD rats, strong signals were seen in the kidneys of PCK rats. Despite a signifi cantly reduced relative kidney weight after 12 weeks of treatment (p<0.05), neither fi brosis and cyst area nor renal function improved during treatment. Sirolimus resulted in a minor inhibition of renal mTOR-specifi c phosphorylation of S6K only. Male PCK rats on sirolimus showed increased concentrations of bile acids and bilirubin compared to controls (each p<0.05 at 12 weeks). Similar, albeit none signifi cant effects were noted in female PCK rats.Conclusions: Sirolimus failed to attenuate progression of kidney and liver disease in PCK rats. Term Outcome of Bilateral Mild Isolated Antenatal Hydronephrosis L.F. Alconcher, M.M. Tombesi, M.B. Meneguzzi. Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Hospital Interzonal General de Agudos Dr Jose Penna, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina. : To assess prevalence, outcome and incidence of urinary infection (UI) in newborns (NB) with bilateral mild isolated antenatal hydronephrosis (MIAH).Methods: 491 NB with antenatal renal abnormalities were prospectively studied. Inclusion criteria: MIAH defi ned as antero-posterior pelvic diameter (APD) \u2264 15 mm confi rmed by fi rst postnatal ultrasound (US). Exclusion criteria: APD > 15mm, calyectasis, hydroureteronephrosis, renal or bladder abnormalities. US follow-up was performed. Neither voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) nor antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) were indicated. Parents were familiarized with the signs of UI. If UI was confi rmed, VCUG was performed. The outcome was assessed as intrauterine involution (IUI), total involution (TI), partial involution (PI), stability (S) and progression (P).Outcome  and incidence of UI was compared with NB with unilateral MIAH. Chi square test was applied. Results: Of the 491 NB, 236 had MIAH (138 unilateral and 98 bilateral). Of the 138 NB with unilateral 38 (27%) showed IUI, 58 (42%) TI, 8 PI, 33 S and 1 P. Of the 98 NB with bilateral (196 renal units (RU)), 72 RU (37%) showed IUI, 82 (42%) TI, 12 PI, 26 S and 3 P. Mean follow-up was 17 and 14 months respectively. Fourteen patients with unilateral and 9 with bilateral MIAH had UI. Refl ux was found in 2 patients with unilateral MIAH. Conclusions: Bilateral MIAH represented 20% of the antenatal renal abnormalities. Outcome and incidence of UI were not statistically different between the two groups. NB with bilateral MIAH would have similar considerations as those with unilateral. Hence, we consider that neither AP nor VCUG are mandatory but follow-up is important. Prevalence and Spectrum of Urinary Tract Abnormalities in Fetuses, Children and Adults with 22q11 Microdeletion J. Harambat, 1 M.A. Delrue, 2 G. Andr\u00e9, 3 B. Llanas, 1 D. Lacombe. 2 1 Pediatric Nephrology, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France; 2 Genetics, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France; 3 Pathology, University Hospital, Bordeaux, France. :The 22q11 deletion is the most frequent interstitial chromosomal aberration. This deletion is detected in various phenotypes including the majority of cases of DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. We aim to describe the prevalence and clinical features of renal disease in 22q11 deletion. Methods: All cases of 22q11 deletion, confi rmed by fl uorescent in situ hybridization at Bordeaux University Hospital, France, between 1995 and 2009 were reviewed. Results: We identifi ed 68 patients (43 males) from 58 families, and 15 fetuses. Five fetuses (33%) had renal malformations: 3 had multicystic kidney disease, 1 had renal agenesis, and 1 had bilateral pelvic dilatation. In patients with postnatal diagnosis, median age at diagnosis was 8.7 years (range 1 months-42 years). Main clinical features were congenital heart disease (61%), facial dysmorphism (92%), mental retardation (89%), velopharyngeal insuffi ciency (58%), growth retardation (50%), and hypocalcemia (18%). Five patients (7%) died. Among the 51 patients with documented renal exploration, 9 (18%) had urinary tract malformations including unilateral renal agenesis (2), obstructive megaureter (1), pelviureteral junction(2), and vesicoureteral refl ux(4). Six patients had episodes of pyelonephritis, and 3 developed chronic kidney disease. Conclusions: 22q11 deletion syndrome should be considered in patients with urinary tract abnormalities and additional signs such as dysmorphia, abnormal voice, or cardiac malformations. Proteinuria as a Marker of Severe Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction in Children O. Mansoor, 1 M. Sasso, 1 C.L. Abitbol, 1 G. Sfakianakis, 2 R. Gosalbez, 3 W. Seeherunvong, 1 J.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 106 children with high grade UUO. Proteinuria was assessed by random urine total protein to creatinine ratio (Upr/cr) (Normal <0.2 mg/mg). Albuminuria was assessed by random urine albumin to creatinine ratio (Ualb/cr) (Normal <30 mcg/mg). Renal pelvic diameter (RPD) was measured by digital real time ultrasonography in centimeters (cm). Renal scintigraphy measured differential renal function in percent. Results: In the cohort 43/106 (41%) required surgical intervention. Current age is 5.5\u00b13.1 years and there is a male predominance (73%). There was also a predominance of left kidney obstruction (67%). The table compares the RPD, Upr/cr and Ualb/cr for surgical (Sgy) versus the non-surgical (No-Sgy) patients:Conclusions:Both proteinuria and albuminuria distinquished those patients with UUO who required surgical intervention. This suggests that proteinuria is a sensitive marker of renal injury in patients with UUO.Nocturnal Bladder Distention and Treatment in Myelodisplastic Children Who Performs Daytime Clean Intermittant CatheterisationI.Akil, C.

Furosemide(FU) is used with IN to lessen them. Ibuprofen(IB)is as effective as IN for closure of PDA with fewer side effects.We examined IN and IB administed with FUon prostanoid synthesis in neonatal rat kidneys. Methods: Rat pups P0(n=12)randomly injected IP1)0.2mg/kg INonP0and0.1 mg/kg on P1&P2;2)10mg/kg IB P0 and 5mg/kg on P1&P2;3) 5mg/kg FU on P0, P1&P2;4) IN+FUonP0,P1,P2;5)IB+FUonP0,P1,P2;or6)equal volume saline(S)on P0,P1,P2. P3, urine and kidneys assessed for PGE 2 ,PGF 2 ,6-keto-PGF 1 ,TxB 2 . Results: IN+FU decreased PGE 2 (157,p<0.01) vs.S(862). FU increased urinary PGE 2 (2478,p<0.001) vs.IN(1603), IB(1781), IN+FU(2002) and IB+FU(1781). IB+FU increased PGF 2 (3443p<0.01) vs.IN(308), IB(947), and IN+FU(39). IB and IB+FU increased renal 6-ketoPGF 1 (10577and10313,p<0.01) vs IN(1141), IN+FU(2344),and FU(687). Urinary 6-ketoPGF 1 increased with IB(7411, p<0.01)vs.all groups. FU increased TxB 2 (2195,p<0.05)and IB increased urinary TxB 2 (8934,p<0.01)vs.S(3353),IN(2502),FU(3018),IN+FU(1897) and IB+FU(2959). Conclusions: FU with IB increase prostanoid excretion suggesting predominance of FU over IB on renal prostanoids. IN and FU decreased PGE 2, most important renal prostanoid. FU does not reverse the renal effects of multiple doses of IN.
