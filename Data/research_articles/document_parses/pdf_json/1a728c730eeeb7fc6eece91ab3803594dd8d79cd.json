CFTR, the membrane protein chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis, is a dynamic biological machine that undergoes functional conformational changes. A significant modulator of this dynamic behavior is the ~200 residue cytoplasmic regulatory (R) region of CFTR, which is intrinsically disordered in isolation and which makes highly dynamic interactions with the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR, other segments of CFTR and other proteins. Similar to many other disordered proteins, the R region is a \"hub\" for regulatory protein interactions and is a site of regulatory phosphorylation, in this case by PKA, PKC and AMPK.",

Analysis of NMR resonance broadening and chemical shift changes upon binding coupled with fluorescence binding measurements provides evidence for multi-site interactions of various segments of the R region. Our interpretation of the binding to the NBDs is that the multiple elements interact by transiently stabilizing helical structure, while binding to the 14-3-3beta likely involves transient stabilization of extended structure around each of the PKA sites. The NBD binding is much stronger for the non-phosphorylated R region while binding to the C-terminus and 14-3-3beta is stronger for the PKA phosphorylated state. Initial studies of isolated peptides of the R region suggest that binding of the entire disordered \"domain\" provides enhancement with synergistic effects of these various interacting elements.",

            "text": "As a potential therapy for CF, small-molecule compounds have been identified that correct the processing/folding defects (correctors) and/or channel gating defects (potentiators) of CFTR F508del. Compounds having dual corrector/potentiator activity have been assumed to interact directly with CFTR, possibly at the NBD1, the site of the F508del mutation. Our goal is to determine how these and other small molecule modulators act at a molecular level using NMR spectroscopy. To obtain solubility and yields required for NMR, our constructs lack the regulatory insert (\u2206RI) of NBD1, as well as the regulatory extension (\u2206RE) which is the first ~30 residues of the regulatory (R) region. We report assignment of 82% of backbone resonances for human F508del NBD1 (\u2206RI\u2206RE) (387-646) based on assignments for the wt NBD1 protein. NMR studies of the interactions of an Epix dual corrector/potentiator, as well as other small-molecule compounds, with human F508del NBD1 (\u2206RI\u2206RE) have enabled mapping of the compoundaffected residues onto the structure of NBD1. The compounds interact with a hydrophobic patch comprised of residues in \u03b2-strands S3, S9 and S10, located within the ATP-binding core near the C-terminus of the molecule. Binding of the compounds disrupts an interaction between this hydrophobic patch and the C-terminal helices (H8 and H9) of NBD1 leading to a shift in a pre-existing conformational equilibrium from helix to coil. DSC data indicates a small decrease in T m in the presence of compound, consistent with a direct interaction between NBD1 and the compound that decreases NBD1 stability. Disruption of the interaction between H8/H9 and the NBD1 core by a mutation within \u03b2-strand S9, H620Q, shown to increase the open probability of the channel (Wei et al. FEBS Letters 439:121, 1998), partially mimics the effect of the compounds by promoting the coil state. These results suggest that perturbations shifting the helices towards the coil state coincide with conditions that promote channel opening. Interestingly, we detect a possible allosteric effect near the site of F508 elicited by both compound binding and the H620Q variant. Evidence for allostery has also been obtained from ICL4 peptide titrations that show chemical shift changes near F508 (at the predicted binding surface) and H8/H9. The suppressor mutations Q637R (between H8 and H9) and V510D (near F508) show similar, although more subtle, effects. These binding and mutagenic data collectively suggest \"cross-talk\" between the \u03b1-subdomain and the hydrophobic patch/C-terminus of NBD1. We hypothesize that the compounds compete with the C-terminal helices (8,9) for the core of NBD1, displacing the RE/R region from the NBD dimerization interface, and thereby promoting NBD dimerization and channel opening. Evidence for allostery suggests that compound binding may also affect interactions with ICLs, particularly ICL4, and/or other parts of CFTR. This work was funded by the CF Foundation Therapeutics.",

Therefore, an important goal in CF therapeutics is to better understand how NBD1 acquires and maintains its folded state in the cellular environment. To address this question, we developed a novel method to monitor de novo NBD1 folding as the nascent chain is synthesized and emerges from the ribosome. Our approach is based on the principle that residues distant in primary structure are brought into close proximity as the domain folds into its native state. Such changes can be detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between an N-terminal donor fluorophore (CFP) and a small fluorescent acceptor dye (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) that is cotranslationally incorporated at strategic residues deduced from the crystal structure. Previous analysis demonstrated that NBD1 translated in a cell free system can reach a native-like state cotranslationally while it is still attached to the ribosome. Detailed studies of nascent chains containing an acceptor probe at residue 450 revealed that NBD1 folding is initiated by an abrupt cotranslational compaction of a small, N-terminal ATP-binding subdomain (residues 378~495). In addition, N-terminal subdomain folding is initiated before Phe508 emerges from the ribosome, suggesting that F508del impacts later folding steps involving the alpha-subdomain (residues 495-564) and/or the F1-type ATPase beta-sheet core.",

FRET between CFP and the acceptor at residue 487 reached a maximum value (40%) as the nascent chain was extended to residue 624. Since the ribosome exit tunnel sequesters 30-40 residues of the nascent polypeptide, we therefore conclude that residue 487 is optimally positioned in the native NBD1 fold only after the entire alpha-subdomain has emerged from the ribosome. Similarly, maximal FRET for the acceptor at residue 567 (32%) was observed only after the nascent chain was extended to residue 654. Thus, optimal positioning of residue 567 appears to require the presence of the alpha-subdomain as well as an adjacent strand (S7) of the beta-sheet core. Interestingly, the extent to which the alpha-subdomain folds appears to depend on the environment in which folding takes place. When nascent chains were released from isolated ribosomes in a dilute buffer solution, maximum FRET (50%) for residue 487 was observed for truncations as short as 550 aa. This suggests that either the presence of the ribosome or cellular factors might delay alpha-subdomain folding as the domain is synthesized in cytosol. In contrast, the opposite effect was observed for residue 567, wherein the ribosome and/or cytosolic factors appear to stimulate folding during synthesis. These results implicate an unexpected level of complexity in NBD1 folding and provide a basis for analyzing the impact of the F508del mutation. Supported by NIH and CFFTI.",

            "text": "Aleksandrov, L.A.; Cui, L.; He, L.; Riordan, J.R. Biochemisry and Biophysics, UNC at CHapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA CFTR is an allosteric protein in which communications between distal sites within and between domains play a crucial role in its stability and function. Earlier we had shown in biochemical and single channel experiments that dynamic coupling between domain-swapped NBDs and MSDs directly mediate some of these allosteric connections (J Biol Chem 283, 26383, 2008) . According to allostery theory, communications between sites are reversible (Science 308, 1424 (Science 308, , 2005 . Here we focused on the bidirectional interactions of sites in the NBDs with ones in the cytoplasmic loops (CLs) of the MSDs on the one hand and with ones in the R domain on the other. Three different methods were used to detect changes at a site in response to perturbation of a coupled site. These included NBD binding of ATP, antibody binding to phosphorylation sensitive epitopes in the R domain and accessibility of maleimide binders to individual cysteines introduced into cysless CFTR. The latter experiments employed a cysless construct modified to mature well in mammalian cells by selective replacements of cysteines in the N-terminal half of the molecule and to have near normal channel gating by replacements in the C-terminal half. Bidirectional interactions between NBD1 and CL4 were reflected in diminished accessibility of CL4 cysteine residues due to NBD1 binding of ATP and a decrease in ATP binding caused by a disease-associated CL4 mutation, R1070Q. Evidence of two way interactions between the R domain and NBD2 came from the altered accessibility of cysteine residues at several positions in NBD2 by R domain phosphorylation while perturbation of NBD2 altered the recognition of epitopes in the R domain. Thus allosteric interactions occur between multiple sites in CFTR and may be fundamental to its complex functional regulation. (Supported by the NIH and CFF).",

Biochemistry, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX, USA Integral membrane protein maturation is a complex process, involving integration of transmembrane spans into the membrane, association of these spans to form transmembrane domains, folding of extramembrane domains, and ultimately association of the membrane and extramembrane domains to form the final, native, functional structure. The complexity of this process presents many steps sensitive to alteration by changes in the primary sequence. For example, deletion of the F508 residue in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR interferes with both domain folding and association and, thus, underlies misfolding, loss-of-function and disease. Second-site suppressor mutations, which compensate for the folding defects of the mutant NBD1 only partially, restore maturation of \u2206F508 CFTR. Therefore, \u2206F508 CFTR is defective in additional steps required for efficient folding. A structural and evolutionary sequence analysis was combined with two in vitro folding assays to identify and define the steps in which \u2206F508 CFTR is defective: 1) stability and efficiency of NBD1 folding and 2) NBD1 / ICL4 (TMD2) association. Correction of either step individually has only modest effect on maturation of CFTR. By contrast, when both steps are improved by introduction of the specific suppressor mutants, the correction \"ceiling\" observed for single mutations and small molecule correctors is surpassed. This finding highlights the stepwise nature of CFTR folding and the influence of the most common CF-causing mutation on multiple steps in the process. The assay systems and second-site suppressor mutants developed may also find utility in establishing a mechanism of action of extant correctors and aid in the identification of new compounds. The mechanism of misfolding of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and the pathways that drive its ER associated degradation (ERAD), remain incompletely understood. Like other eukaryotic ABC proteins, CFTR is comprised of two transmembrane domains (TMD1, TMD2), each linked to a cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1, NBD2). The common mutation leading to protein misfolding, \u2206F508, is located in NBD1, where it alters domain stability and domaindomain interactions. As a consequence, the mutant protein is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation.",

In this assay, NBD1 sumoylation was detected primarily from the molecular mass shift associated with SUMO modification upon blotting the reaction mix with an NBD1 antibody. Purified WT and \u2206F508 NBD1 were found to be modified by the SUMO-1, -2, and -3 isoforms. As found in vivo, significantly greater modification was observed for \u2206F508 vs. WT NBD1, and Hsp27 was shown to facilitate NBD1 modification by In vivo studies of NBD1 were performed by co-expressing Hsp27 in HEK293 cells with membrane tethered fusion proteins, CD4T-NBD1 or CD4T-\u2206F508-NBD1, in which the C-terminus of CD4T is fused to the WT or mutant NBD1 (1). As observed for full-length CFTR, we found that CD4T-\u2206F508-NBD1 was selectively degraded relative to CD4T-NBD1. Co-IP experiments using lysates from transiently expressing HEK293 cells showed that: a) Hsp27 preferentially promoted the sumoylation and degradation of CD4T-\u2206F508-NBD1, b) Hsp27 interacted preferentially with the \u2206F508-NBD1-CD4T fusion protein, and c) Hsp27 associated with SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 in vivo. These data suggest that the structural defect in \u2206F508 NBD1 is interpreted by Hsp27 in a manner similar to that observed for full-length \u2206F508 CFTR, and that this interaction makes the mutant NBD accessible to proteasome-mediated degradation by eliciting its SUMO modification. The recapitulation of this pathway for the NBD1 mutant should expedite efforts to identify the site(s) of SUMO modification and further elucidate the mechanism of sHsp-mediated CFTR degradation. The most common CF-causing mutation, found in 90% of patients, is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (\u2206F508-CFTR) in nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) of CFTR. \u2206F508-CFTR misfolds, accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, and consequently is degraded. As the mutant protein is expressed in the proper cells, under proper regulatory control, and is functional when induced to fold, a promising strategy to treat the disease is to identify small molecules which correct the mistrafficking and folding of the mutant protein. Prior HTS efforts have discovered a number of small molecules that restore \u2206F508-CFTR Cl --channel function or surface expression with limited efficacy. A representative collection of these correctors is available in the CFFTI panel. Some of these compounds may achieve correction by direct interaction with CFTR. Recent work suggests that at least two steps in folding are altered by the deletion of F508 in CFTR: 1) decreased folding efficiency and stability of NBD1 and 2) inefficient assembly of NBD1 and ICL4 of TMD2. Like the extant corrector compounds, secondsite suppressor mutations that overcome either of these two defects also have measurable, but limited, ability to correct mutant CFTR folding. However, when the suppressors are combined, much more significant correction is observed. To test the hypotheses that some extant CFTR correctors act directly on CFTR and that their efficacy is limited because they act on only one of the two defective steps, the effect of the CFFTI panel compounds on assays designed to reflect the individual folding steps were executed. First, compounds were assessed for effect on the stability of the isolated NBD1 and its folding efficiency in cells. Second, compounds were assessed for synergy with \u2206F508-CFTR independently in combination with the secondsite suppressors that improve either NBD1 folding or NBD1 ICL4 association utilizing biochemical and functional methods. Understanding the mechanism of action of small molecules that act to rescue \u2206F508-CFTR is critical for a targeted, combinatorial therapeutic strategy and may suggest alternative strategies for identification of new correctors.",

Currents were elicited by 15mV voltage steps from -100mV to 125mV activated by 500mM cpt-cAMP and 40mM forskolin in the absence of a potentiator. The critical aspect of this experiment is that no current was generated from unrescued \u2206F508-CFTR alone, or from \u220627-264-CFTR alone. Only when both were added together did we observe significant whole cell currents which reached a level near to that of wt CFTR. The currents measured only when both are cotransfected could have originated either from \u2206F508-CFTR or \u220627-264-CFTR. To address this question definitively we utilized a well-known CFTR conduction mutant, S341A. This mutant alters the conductance and anion selectivity of CFTR. The S341 residue has also been identified as critical to the inhibition of arylaminobenzoate drugs such as DPC (see Zhang et al. Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 282: L135-L145, 2002) . To confirm these findings, we tested this mutation in S341A-wt-CFTR. High levels of S341A-wt-CFTR protein were detected and normally glycosylated but the whole cell currents were drastically reduced compared to wt CFTR. We then studied the double mutant, S341A-\u2206F508-CFTR. We detected expression of B-band but no detectable chloride currents consistent with what we observed with \u2206F508-CFTR alone. When we cotransfected S341A-\u2206F508-CFTR with \u220627-264-CFTR we detected rescued C band of \u2206F508-CFTR consistent with rescue of S341A-\u2206F508-CFTR trafficking but the chloride currents were dramatically reduced. These data demonstrate that the currents observed when \u2206F508-CFTR and \u220627-264-CFTR were cotransfected were generated by rescued \u2206F508-CFTR and not by \u220627-264-CFTR.

            "text": "Funded by CFF and NHLBI. CFTR trafficking at the plasma membrane is a dynamic process involving rapid clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosomal sorting/recycling. The regulation of CFTR trafficking is incompletely understood, in part because of the limited resolution of available methods such as immunocytochemistry, biochemistry and imaging of GFP-CFTR chimeras. In this study, we aimed to develop a rapid and sensitive imaging-based approach to study CFTR endocytosis in live cells. Application of fluorescence imaging methods to study CFTR trafficking requires unambiguous distinction of plasma membrane-resident versus endocytic/lysosomal-associated pools of CFTR. We reasoned that surface versus internal pools of CFTR labelled with an external fluorophore could be resolved based on accessibility of a cellimpermeable quencher to fluorophores. A screen of candidate quenchers identified several molecules that efficiently reduced the fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) in vitro. Most candidate quenchers were unsuitable for the development of cell-based assays because application to cells was associated with greatly increased fluorescence signal (>5-fold background). However, one candidate quencher, bromocresol green (BCG), did not increase background fluorescence when applied to cells. BCG at 4 mM was cell impermeable and reduced the fluorescence intensity of surface-exposed AF488 by ~100%. An MDCK cell line stably expressing CFTR containing a triplet HA-tag engineered into the fourth extracellular loop (CFTR-3HA) was used to study CFTR endocytosis. To selectively label CFTR-3HA, cells were incubated with AF488-conjugated anti-HA antibody and washed. Endocytosis was quantified by assessment of AF488 fluorescence intensity before versus after BCG application after incubations of cells for specified times at 37\u00b0C. CFTR internalization was near zero at 0 min, ~8% at 5 min and ~20% at 10 min. As expected, CFTR endocytosis was completely inhibited by latrunculin and jasplakinolide, which disrupt the actin cytoskeleton. CFTR endocytosis was < 2% when the carboxy-terminus of CFTR (residues 1395-1480) was overexpressed, probably due to competition for endocytic adapter proteins that bind motifs within this region of CFTR (including 1424YDSI and 1430LL). Activation of protein kinase A inhibited CFTR endocytosis significantly (~2% at 10 min), but endocytosis was not altered by activation of protein kinase C. We found no change in CFTR endocytosis after deletion of the CFTR C-terminal PSD-95/DlgA/ZO1-(PDZ-) binding domain to prevent PDZ interactions. Similarly, CFTR endocytosis was not altered by expression of a dominant-negative version of the PDZ domain protein EBP50 that does not interact with ezrin or actin. As such, in contrast to members of the G-protein coupled receptor family, PDZ-type interactions do not alter rates of CFTR endocytosis. Our method to study CFTR endocytosis is technically simple and rapid, and suitable for screening of small-molecule stabilizers of surface \u2206F508-CFTR expression.",

Hsp105 serves as a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70 and functionally relates to Hsp90. To explore the potential impact of Hsp105 on protein misfolding in cystic fibrosis, we investigated the role of human Hsp105\u03b1, the constitutively expressed isoform, in the biogenesis and quality control of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Pulse-chase analysis revealed that Hsp105\u03b1 enhances the co-translational degradation of \u2206F508 CFTR but has less effect on wild-type CFTR, suggesting that it plays a role in the co-translational quality control of CFTR. Expression of the substrate binding domain of Hsp105 greatly enhances the synthetic yield of \u2206F508 CFTR, and increases the steady state level of its mature form, leading to greater cell surface functional expression of the mutant CFTR. At the post-translational level, Hsp105\u03b1 overexpression not only promotes the maturation of wild-type CFTR but also enhances the temperature-rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR, suggesting a specific role in forward folding of CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The \u2206F508 CFTR has much reduced peripheral stability at physiological temperature. We found that Hsp105\u03b1 preferentially associates with \u2206F508 CFTR in post-ER compartments, and stabilizes \u2206F508 CFTR from peripheral quality control. Consistent with the above, overexpressing Hsp105\u03b1 enhances the processing of \u2206F508 CFTR at physiological temperature, and increases its cell surface functional expression in HEK 293 cells. We conclude that Hsp105 regulates the co-translational quality control, post-translational maturation and the peripheral stability of \u2206F508 CFTR. The fact that Hsp105 enhances both the maturation of CFTR in the ER and the stability of \u2206F508 CFTR at the cell periphery makes it an attractive target for the rescue of \u2206F508 misprocessing in cystic fibrosis.

            "text": "Both Hsp70 and Hsp90 are involved in the biogenesis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) but their functional relationship remains unclear. The arrest of \u2206F508 CFTR conformational maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is reversed at reduced temperature in a chaperone-dependent manner. Using the temperature-dependent maturation of \u2206F508 CFTR as a model system, we provide evidence for functional cooperation between Hsp70 and Hsp90 during \u2206F508 CFTR maturation. In a HEK293 cell line stably expressing \u2206F508 CFTR, depletion of Hsp90\u03b2 by shRNA dramatically reduces the levels of Hsc70, Hop, Hsp105 and Hdj-2, and specifically inhibits \u2206F508 maturation at reduced temperature. Using cycloheximide chase and pulse-chase analyses, we demonstrate that neither the peripheral stability nor the post-translational ERAD of \u2206F508 CFTR is affected at reduced temperature. Consistent with Hop's role as a functional link between Hsp70 and Hsp90, Hop depletion reciprocally reduces the levels of Hsc70, Hsp90\u03b2 and Hsp105, and inhibits the \u2206F508 CFTR temperature-dependent maturation. Interestingly, depletion of Hsp105, a nucleotide exchange factor for Hsp70, reduces the level of Hsc70 and Hsp90\u03b2, and impairs \u2206F508 CFTR maturation at low temperature. The conformational rescue of \u2206F508 CFTR at low temperature is accompanied by dynamic chaperone recruitment and dissociation. We assessed such dynamic CFTRchaperone association using quantitative co-immunoprecipitation, and found that Hop depletion diminishes the recruitment of Hsp90\u03b2 and Hsp105 but not Hsp70 or Hdj-2, suggesting that Hop links Hsp90\u03b2 to Hsp70 during \u2206F508 CFTR maturation, and that Hsp105 functions downstream of Hop. Hsp105 depletion also specifically reduces the recruitment of Hsp90\u03b2 but not other chaperone components, suggesting that Hsp105 also functionally links Hsp70 and Hsp90 in \u2206F508 CFTR maturation. Our data support the presence of an Hsp70-Hsp90 relay system on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane, specifically facilitating CFTR post-translational conformational maturation. Hop and Hsp105 facilitate the chaperone relay by promoting Hsp90\u03b2 recruitment. Background: CFTR has been shown to interact directly or indirectly with a wide variety of proteins and form multiprotein macromolecular complexes at specialized subcellular domains. These dynamic protein-protein interactions influence CFTR channel function as well as its localization and processing within cells. We previously found that CFTR complexes with the type 2 lysophosphatidic acid receptor (LPA 2 ) and Na + /H + exchanger regulatory factor-2 (NHERF2) at the plasma membrane of airway epithelia.",

            "text": "At the cellular level the \u2206F508 lesion causes the protein to be recognized as abnormal by quality control systems and degraded, resulting in loss of its function to control epithelial ion and fluid homeostasis. At the protein level the primary impact of the absence of F508 is thermodynamic instability. This property is expected to be context dependent and we postulated that the impact might be different in CFTRs of different species. We have con-firmed this hypothesis and been able to mimic features of the protein, in species less influenced by the mutation, to stabilize the human mutant. Wildtype and \u2206F508 versions of CFTR from several other species heterologously expressed in human cells revealed that the mutation had generally similar effects on maturation and stability as in the human protein. In contrast, the \u2206F508 mutants of several non-mammalian species including amphibian, elasmobranch and avian matured nearly as well as their wild-type counterparts at 37\u00b0C. Most striking was the result with avian CFTR that not only matured similarly whether F508 was present or not, but also was not thermally destabilized by the mutation. Thus strong channel activity persisted at temperatures of 40\u00b0C and above where human \u2206F508 CFTR was entirely inactive. The half-life in cells of bird \u2206F508 CFTR was similar to the wildtype and to the human wild-type. We focused on sequence differences at particular sites between human and avian CFTR that might be expected to influence structural stability and dynamics. In addition to the I539T substitution, present in nearly all species except human, and which promotes ER export but not thermostability of \u2206F508, we found a strong correlation between residue substitutions at other specific positions and both maturation and thermostability of the \u2206F508 protein. Making these substitutions in human \u2206F508 CFTR provided it with a similar level of thermodynamic stability. We believe that these strategically placed residues are part of an allosteric network connecting dynamic elements of the mutant NBD1 enabling overall stability of the domain (and of the full-length protein) similar to the wild-type and hypothesize that the binding of specific ligands to specific sites on the mutant protein may be able to have a similar influence. (Supported by the NIH and CFF.) S-Nitrosothiols (SNO's) are endogenous signaling molecules with many potentially beneficial effects and serve as S-nitrosylating agents. SNO's are normally present in the lungs, but concentrations tend to be low in cystic fibrosis patients. This is likely attributable to up-regulated S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) activity. GSNOR is an enzyme that regulates nitric oxide and S-nitrosothiol homeostasis in tissues and is widely expressed in many tissues, including the lungs. Recently, it has been reported that GSNOR activity is elevated in a murine model of allergic asthma. Mice deficient in GSNOR have increased concentrations of SNO in their lungs. Previously, we and several investigators have shown that different Snitrosothiols increase the expression, maturation and function of mutant \u2206F508 CFTR in polarized and non-polarized human bronchial airway epithelial (HBAE) cells. Our studies have indicated that the effect of SNO on \u2206F508 CFTR maturation may be mediated through the degradation of Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein (Hop), a co-chaperone of the major molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90. Hop facilitates the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsp90 and modulates their activity by acting as an adapter between the two chaperone proteins. We have recently shown that GSNO treatment decreases Hop expression and Hop-CFTR interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum of CFBE41o-cells, and that this effect is necessary for the maturation and cell-surface expression of \u2206F508 CFTR. We have also determined that SNO's affect Hop expression by S-nitrosylation of cysteine residue C403S. Mutation of C403S prevents GSNO-induced Hop degradation and S-nitrosylation. Here, we sought to determine for the first time the role of GSNOR in \u2206F508 CFTR maturation in human bronchial airway epithelial cells. We showed that GSNOR activity is significantly elevated in the mutant HBAE cells expressing \u2206F508 CFTR when compared to the wild type HBAE cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy the cellular colocalization of Hop and GSNOR in CFBE41o-cells. From this experiment, it appears that GSNOR and Hop interact directly. We also were able to demonstrate that GSNOR knockdown with GSNOR siRNA duplexes increases expression of \u2206F508 CFTR. We transfected CFBE41o-cells with 50, 75 and 100 nM siRNA duplexes spe-cific for GSNOR using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48h of transfection, cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed directly on plates using lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-CFTR monoclonal antibody (clone CFTR#596 mAb, a kind gift from Dr. J.R.Riordan). Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous GSNOR by using siRNA duplexes for GSNOR produced a marked increase in levels of fully mature forms of \u2206F508 CFTR and also decreased Hop expression. This data suggests that GSNOR could potentially become an attractive therapeutic target for cystic fibrosis by preventing SNO toxicity in CF patients. Supported by CF Foundation and the NIH.",

They also reveal a novel regulation of CFTR by SYK, a recognized controller of inflammation. One unique feature about CFTR as an ion channel is that the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis harnessed by its nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) drives the gating motion of its transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the ion permeation pathway. Previous studies in our lab have established the idea that in the presence of ATP, CFTR mostly shuttles between two conformations throughout its gating cycle: a close state with two NBDs partially separated and an open state in which NBDs form a dimer with two ATP molecules buried in the dimer interface. Since ATP interacts exclusively with NBDs, the signal upon ATP binding and subsequent NBD dimerization must be allosterically transmitted to TMDs to initiate the cycle. Based on crystallographic data of ABC proteins as well as classical kinetic studies of CFTR gating, it has been proposed that TMDs and NBDs may move in a synchronized manner so that the ATP hydrolysis cycle is strictly coupled to the gating cycle.",

            "text": "In this study, by applying rapid ligand-exchange protocols while recording CFTR currents with the patch-clamp technique, we were able to capture a transient conformation between the two aforementioned states by locking the post-hydrolytic channel into an open state with non-hydrolytic ATP analogs, such as pyrophosphate (PPi) or adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). We showed that when switching the ligand from ATP to a very brief application of PPi while CFTR is in the open but not the closed state, the channel proceeds directly into a locked-open state without closing. For such an open-to-open transition to take place upon switching the ligand, the NBD dimer must have separated to a dimension larger than that of every participating ligand while TMDs remain in the open conformation. Further supporting this idea, such lock-open effect of PPi is attenuated by ADP in a dose dependent manner, suggesting a competition between ADP and PPi. Such competition indicates that during the open-to-open transition, the NBD dimer is not only separated but the composite site 2, formed by the head of NBD2 and the tail of NBD1, must be vacant. These results thus suggest that The \u2206F508 mutation in CFTR impairs its folding, stability and chloride channel gating. Though small molecules that separately correct defective \u2206F508-CFTR folding/cellular processing ('correctors') or chloride channel gating ('potentiators') have been discovered and are in clinical trials, single compounds with bona fide dual corrector and potentiator activities have not been identified. Here, screening of ~110,000 not-previously tested small molecules revealed a cyanoquinoline class of compounds with independent corrector and potentiator activities (Corrector-Potentiators, CoPo's). Testing of 180 commercially available CoPo analogs revealed 6 cyanoquinolines with dual corrector and potentiator activities, and 13 with only potentiator activity. Based on the initial results, we synthesized a library of structurally focused CoPo analogs. We found that CoPo analogs having a constrained ring reduced corrector activity whereas analogs containing an arylacid moiety showed greatest corrector and potentiator activities. Reference compound amino)ethyl)-3methoxybenzamide, was synthesized in 6 steps in 52 % overall yield and had micromolar potency for \u2206F508-CFTR corrector and potentiator activities. Short-circuit current measurement showed that maximal corrector and potentiator activities of CoPo-22 were comparable to those conferred by the bithiazole Corr-4a and the flavone genistein, respectively. Immunoblot confirmed increased C-band following CoPo-22 incubation. CoPo-22 also activated chloride conductance in cells expressing wild type and G551D CFTR within minutes in a forskolin-dependent manner, indicating broad specificity for potentiator action.

In the present study we have compared the membrane characteristics including surface stability and function between human and ferret WT-and \u2206F-CFTR proteins containing an extracellular HA tag. As expected by surface HA IF staining under non-permeabilization conditions, we found that both fCFTR and hCFTR are present at the cell surface in BHK21, HT1080, and polarized CuFi cells.

During a \"training\" phase, the algorithm aligns a randomly chosen subset of 547 CFTR homologs and paralogs, and uses the random set of sequences to score 65 known CF-causing and 75 known CF-neutral CFTR missense mutations; this process is repeated 100,000 times (iterations). At each iteration, specific CFTR homologs and paralogs determined to confer the greatest predictive ability, in previous iterations, are chosen with a higher probability and have greater influence on the score function; this entire training phase is repeated 50 times (i.e., 5x10 6 sequences sets are tested, beginning from 50 random starting alignments). In a \"testing\" phase, the sequences determined to have the greatest predictive power in the training phase are used to score 43 known CF-causing and 60 known CF-neutral CFTR missense mutations, and the overall performance is assessed (note: training-and test-set mutations are disjoint). Training and testing phases are repeated in triplicate to ensure the training phase converges on a similar set of sequences and the performance is stable in the testing phase.

In our initial experiment, we determined the global transcriptome of culture CF lung epithelial cells (IB3-1) and its genetically repaired daughter cell (S9) by massive parallel sequencing (RNA-seq) using an Illumina platform (Genome Analyzer IIx) and protocols. This approach generated approximately 40 million sequencing reads of 40 bp length on average per sample. Reads were aligned to a reference human genome using the Tophat algorithm and expression data was calculated using the Cufflinks algorithm to determine the reads per kb exon per million mapped reads (RPKM) value. The Cuffdiff algorithm was used to determine differentially expressed genes between IB3-1 and S9 cells. Eighty-eight percent of the reads were accurately aligned to the human genome and corresponded to 12,634 genes. From this dataset, we observed a high correlation between differentially expressed genes revealed in both microarray-based versus RNA-seq-based analysis. Additionally, we observed a significant number of differentially expressed genes between IB3-1 and S9 cells that were not detected in microarray-based analysis.",

A subset of 119 differentially expressed genes was enriched for response to biotic stimuli function (p = 0.0003). These genes displayed network connectivity centered on interleukin-8 (IL8), prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), and serpin peptidase inhibitor member 4 (SERPINB4) transcripts. We also observed a high correlation between differential gene expression and protein expression of the high abundance proteome in the cultured lung epithelial cells. Most notably, 7 of 8 differentially expressed proteins with differential protein synthetic rates also possessed differential transcript expression levels. Interestingly, this high confidence transcriptomic-proteomic correlation included keratin 18, which has been demonstrated to interact with mutated CFTR and been observed to be differentially expressed during lung epithelial tissue development. We conclude that further analysis of cultured and primary CF lung epithelial cells using next-generation RNA sequencing techniques will identify the cellular consequences of CFTR defects and provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention for CF disease. The expression pattern of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) is spatially and temporally complex, and understanding how this is regulated is an important goal in the development of new therapies for cystic fibrosis. While cis-acting genomic elements are critical to the regulation of CFTR expression, microRNAs (miRNAs) may also play a significant role. These short (~22nt), endogenously expressed, noncoding RNAs generally suppress gene expression by binding to the 3' UTR of mammalian transcripts and blocking translation or promoting the degradation of the transcript. Despite the potential importance of miRNA regulation of CFTR, it has not yet been the subject of intense investigation.",

To accomplish this, candidate miRNAs were identified using the TargetScan 5.1 prediction algorithm and available cell type expression data. Thirteen of these candidate miRNAs with the highest TargetScan context scores were evaluated in relevant human cell lines. The ability of miRNA mimics (dsRNA molecules which are processed like endogenous miRNAs) to repress endogenous CFTR expression and luciferase expression from a reporter construct carrying the CFTR 3' UTR was determined. Twelve of the thirteen miRNAs reproducibly repressed endogenous CFTR mRNA expression by 40-80% in the Caco2 cell line (CFTR+, human colorectal adenocarcinoma). Four of the 12 miRNAs also reproducibly down-regulated expression of the luciferase reporter by 30-50% relative to a negative control miRNA in Caco2 and PANC-1 cells (CFTR-, human pancreatic duct carcinoma), verifying that knockdown is occurring, at least partially, through sites in the CFTR 3' UTR. Each of the four miRNAs also reduced endogenous CFTR protein by 30-60% in Caco2. Three additional miRNAs down-regulated reporter expression in PANC-1, but not Caco2. Expression profiling of three of the miRNAs which repress the 3' UTR reporter in Caco2 cells revealed that all three are expressed in primary human tracheal and bronchial epithelial cell cultures at levels similar to the cell lines used in this study. Further studies will elucidate the effect of these miRNAs on endogenous CFTR protein function and the mechanism by which it occurs. These may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for CF.

Control of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is spatially and temporally regulated, though the promoter lacks tissue-specific regulatory elements. While intronic and flanking regions of the CFTR locus contain some cell-type specific control elements, the mechanism by which they regulate expression is not fully understood. One element that is critical to the regulation of CFTR is located within a DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS) in intron 11 of the gene. Identified in intestinal and male genital duct epithelial cells, this element, which interacts with the CFTR promoter in vivo and encompasses a potent enhancer, acts cooperatively with another CFTR enhancer to augment CFTR Protein folding is the primary role of the proteostasis network (PN), although the stoichiometry(s) of chaperone interactions with wild-type and mutant folds are largely unknown. Also, the principles driving the activity of the PN in normal and disease biology remain elusive. To address the issue of protein folding complexes facilitating wild-type and \u2206F508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) biogenesis, we have applied state-of-the-art absolute quantification mass spectrometry (MS). Using labeled chaperone proteins and single ion reaction monitoring (SRM) we have defined the in vivo role(s) of the PN in the defective folding of \u2206F508 CFTR responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF). Our studies now show the presence of a stalled \u2206F508 CFTR folding intermediate in stoichiometric association with the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 90 (Hsp90) PN systems. Temperature correction of \u2206F508 restores the substoichiometric association of the Hsp70 and 90 chaperones observed with wild-type CFTR. We propose that this energetically uncoupled chaperone trap kinetically restricts \u2206F508 from the productive folding pathway and therefore represents a critical step in CFTR biogenesis that must be resolved to restore normal function. We suggest that such energetically destabilized folding intermediates present a challenge to proteostasis biology, serving as a nidus for CF and other misfolding diseases.",

F508del-CFTR is rapidly degraded by the quality control systems in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [2] , and there is still no drug that can fully reverse this degradation. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying the degradation process remain unclear. Recent studies from this group and others indicate that the F508del mutation causes misfolding and aggregation of the first nucleotide-binding domain in human CFTR (hNBD1) [3, 4] . This misfolding of hNBD1 may be the central contributor to F508del-CF pathogenesis. These findings suggest new approaches to the development of in vitro high-throughput screening assays to identify chemicals that can prevent aggregation of F508del-hNBD1 and thereby inhibit degradation of F508del-CFTR in vivo. Interdomain associations in CFTR are believed to be important factors in controlling the activity and stability of CFTR and may also be compromised by the F508del mutation [5, 6] . Therefore, there is also interest in developing high-throughput screening assays to identify compounds that strengthen interdomain interactions in CFTR.",

In contrast to those previously published, the model is in agreement with expected channel properties such as pore shape and dimensions, relative solvent accessibility of pore residues and experimentally derived pairwise distances. The model also allows for an exploration of the interaction of anionic open channel blockers within the pore, revealing a common binding mode at the lower vestibule dominated by ionic interactions with K95 in agreement with experimental data, as well as interactions with W1145 and R352. The binding site structure and binding mode hypothesis have been further validated with a virtual screening experiment, showing known blockers significantly enriched compared to a random set of drug-like compounds. In addition, a model of mutant F508del CFTR has been derived from the wt, with both proteins subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These reveal a destabilizing effect of the F508 deletion, in agreement with experimental data. Modeling and MD suggest previously unaddressed salt-bridge interactions that may be important for structural stability, as well as identifying pore-lining residues that likely confer ion selectivity.",

The chloride channel activity of CFTR is regulated by the binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides at the nucleotide binding domains, and by the phosphorylation of the R domain by PKA. Currently, it is understood that certain PKA consensus sites (including serines 737 and 768) are phosphorylated in the resting cell and that phosphorylation at these sites may act to maintain the channel in a closed state. On the other hand, PKA mediated phosphorylation of distinct sites, including serines 660, 795 and 813, is enhanced by agonists of cAMP and promotes CFTR activation. However, this model is based primarily on the analysis of PKA site mutations which could lead to structural changes in the R domain as well as changes in the phosphorylation status. Therefore, we assessed the proportional phosphorylation of two PKA sites amenable to quantification by mass spectrometry, S660 and S737.",

            "text": "Ubiquitination plays critical roles in the proteasomal degradation of misfolded immature CFTR in ER as well as in the lysosomal degradation of misfolded mature CFTR in the cell periphery. Previously, we have shown that the CFTR-associated protein CAL retains and degrades mature CFTR in the lysosomal system. To investigate the possible involvement of the ubiquitination system in CAL-mediated CFTR degradation, we tested a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases that (1) bind to CAL (2) enhance mature CFTR degradation and (3) depend on CAL for its activity. We reasoned that CAL as a scaffold protein may recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) into CAL-CFTR complexes to facilitate CFTR degradation. By using co-immunoprecipitation assay in transfected HEK293 cells we identified the interaction of CAL with MARCH II and MARCH III proteins. Members of the membrane associated ring CH (MARCH) E3 ubiquitin ligase family were first identified as proteins related to immune-evasion strategies in viruses that degrade the host MHC class I molecules in the lysosome. MARCH II and MARCH III are the most closely related proteins in the MARCH family with 63% identify. MARCH II is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues examined while MARCH III is enriched in lung, colon and spleen. Overexpression of either HA-tagged MARCH II or MARCH III led to dose-dependent degradation of CFTR. Since MARCH II is ubiquitously expressed, we focused on it for the subsequent studies. Overexpression of MARCH II had no effect on \u2206F508-CFTR or on a CFTR mutant lacking PDZ motif (\u2206TRL-CFTR). Furthermore, silencing of endogenous CAL inhibited the effect of MARCH II on CFTR. These data suggest both CAL and the PDZ motif on CFTR are involved in MARCH II degradation of mature CFTR. MARCH II and MARCH III were previously identified by others as a syntaxin 6 interacting protein. Interestingly, we have previously demonstrated that syntaxin 6 binds to CAL and CFTR and that syntaxin 6 is a component of CAL-complex involved in mature CFTR degradation. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed the colocalization of HA tagged MARCH II with GFP-CAL and with GFP-syntaxin 6 in transfected HEK293 cells. In addition, syntaxin 6 enhanced the binding of MARCH II to CAL as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. Taken together, our data indicated that E3 ubiquitin ligases MARCH II/ MARCH III are new components of CAL-complexes and suggested that the multiple interactions of MARCH II / MARCH III with CAL, and syntaxin 6 are necessary for CAL-mediated lysosomal degradation of mature CFTR.

School of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom Small-molecule potentiators have been identified which target the gating defects of F508del-CFTR, the commonest cystic fibrosis (CF) mutation (1). However, relatively little is known about the effects of potentiators on other CF mutations. Here, we investigate the effects of potentiators on A561E-CFTR, the second most common CF mutation in Portugal. Like F508del, A561E is a temperature-sensitive processing mutant located in the first nucleotide-binding domain (2) ; our preliminary studies suggest that it also severely disrupts channel gating. For this study, we used baby-hamsterkidney (BHK) cells stably expressing A561E-CFTR and the iodide efflux assay. As controls, we studied wild-type-CFTR (WT-CFTR) and F508del-CFTR. We tested the potentiators PG-01 (P2), SF-03 (P3), UCCF-853 (P4), \u2206F508 act -02 (P5) and UCCF180 (P9) (all obtained from CFFT Compound Collection, and used at 10\u00b5M in the presence of the cAMP agonist forskolin, 10\u00b5M); genistein (50\u00b5M) was used as a reference potentiator. At 37\u00b0C, forskolin and genistein failed to elicit iodide efflux from A561E-and F508del-CFTR expressing cells, whereas WT-CFTR expressing cells produced a large transient iodide efflux. When cells were incubated at 27\u00b0C for 24hr, Clchannel activity was partially restored to A561E (83%) and F508del (74%), relative to the response evoked by WT-CFTR expressing cells treated with forskolin and genistein. All potentiators tested enhanced iodide efflux from both A561E-and F508del-CFTR expressing cells (n = 4, P<0.05, unpaired T-test versus vehicle). However, none of them restored channel activity to WT-CFTR levels. For A561E-CFTR cells, the rank order of potentiation was P4 \u2265 P9 \u2265 P2 > P5 > P3 (44 \u00b1 6, 38 \u00b1 5, 33 \u00b1 2, 20 \u00b1 4, 14 \u00b1 1, respectively, %WT-CFTR Genistein, n = 4). For F508del-CFTR, the rank order was P2 \u223c P5 \u2265 P4 > P3 > P9 (22 \u00b1 2, 22 \u00b1 5, 19 \u00b1 3, 15 \u00b1 3, 10 \u00b1 1, respectively, %WT-CFTR Genistein, n = 4). In conclusion, all of the small molecules tested that potentiate F508del-CFTR also enhance A561E-CFTR channel function, and the overall potentiating effects are better in A561E-CFTR expressing cells. However, variation in the rank order may indicate differences in the channel behavior of A561E-and F508del-CFTR, which require further investigation using single-channel recording.",

Individual PDZ binding motifs reveal interactions with up to seven residues, denoted by their distance from the terminus, e.g., P0, P-1. In many cases, however, binding motifs reveal only two or three sequence constraints on the target sequence, and PDZ binding is notoriously promiscuous, with one domain binding multiple targets.

Global motif analysis of the CAL PDZ domain shows strong residue preferences only at the P0 and P-2 positions. Using a peptide array engineering approach however, we identified robust affinity determinants reaching back to the P-5 position. The result was the inhibitor peptide iCAL36 (ANSRWPTSII), which increases apical abundance of functional \u2206F508-CFTR in CFBE cells. We also previously showed that applying iCAL36 to an epithelial monolayer increases the activity of \u2206F508-CFTR by about 25%. However, studies using siRNA to inhibit CAL expression in the same system show a >200% increase in chloride efflux by \u2206F508-CFTR.

To understand CAL and TIP-1's upstream affinity, as well as design better CAL inhibitors, we co-crystallized their PDZ domains with iCAL36, revealing interactions along the length of the peptide. By varying the P-5 position, and by comparing the structures of peptides with different C-terminal sequences, we can also visualize the interplay between C-terminal and upstream binding determinants. Our results suggest different C-terminal \"core\" sequences impose different upstream preferences for PDZ domain interactions.

Biomedical Engineering, UNC Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Assembly of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) epithelial anion channel is perturbed by the deletion of F508 from the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) responsible for most cystic fibrosis. The mutant polypeptide is recognized by cellular quality control systems and is proteolyzed. CFTR NBD1 contains a 32-residue segment termed the regulatory insertion (RI) absent in other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We have reported that complete removal of RI enables delF508 CFTR to mature and traffic to the cell surface where it mediates regulated anion efflux and exhibits robust single chloride channel activity, none of which are possible via partial removal of RI (Aleksandrov et al 2010) . Now using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations of NBD1, we have identified unprecedented dynamic coupling between RI and other regions of NBD1. In particular, RI dynamically influences the F508 and I539 containing loops, the importance of which has been realized previously. Our results indicate that RI may indirectly influence the interaction of NBD1 with the rest of the protein by attenuating the coupling of the F508-containing loop with the F1-like ATP-binding core subdomain so that RI removal overcomes the perturbations caused by F508 deletion. We conclude that restriction of RI to a particular conformational state may ameliorate the impact of this disease-causing mutation.",

We therefore investigated the effect of cigarette smoke on CFTR expression and function. We found that cigarette smoke negatively regulates CFTR expression in human bronchial epithelial cells by decreasing CFTR mRNA transcript and protein levels as measured by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Cigarette smoke also decreased CFTR function in human bronchial epithelial cells as assessed by Ussing chambers. CFTR function was evaluated in vivo in the lung of mice and we found that cigarette smoke decreased alveolar fluid clearance by around 30% in 24 hours. In order to understand the mechanism by which cigarette smoke regulates CFTR expression, we explored the role of MAPK pathways. Cigarette smoke activated the three major MAPK pathways (i.e. P38, JNK and Erk1/2) in a time-and dose-dependent manner in bronchial epithelial cells. Inhibition of the p38 or JNK pathway had no effect on CFTR protein. Conversely, inhibition of the Erk1/2 pathway, using a specific inhibitor, prevented the cigarette smoke-induced loss of CFTR protein in the human bronchial epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE41o-. The involvement of this latter MAPK pathway in CFTR regulation was further confirmed by treating 16HBE41o-cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an Erk1/2 activator, leading to the loss of CFTR protein. Since Erk1/2 activity has been reported to be elevated in the lung of COPD patients, we propose that targeting this MAPK pathway could restore CFTR expression and function.",

            "text": "Previous work showed that CFTR interacts with AMP (adenosine 5'monophosphate) at a site distinct from its two well characterized ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) binding-sites. The data further indicated that in the presence of AMP, CFTR adenylate kinase activity (ATP+AMP\u00c42 ADP) is coupled to channel activity. Ap 5 A (P 1 ,P 5 -di(adenosine-5\u2032) pentaphosphate) and Ap 4 A (P 1 ,P 4 -di(adenosine-5\u2032) tetraphosphate) are compounds that inhibit the activity of adenylate kinases and CFTR gating. Both molecules contain two adenosine groups connected by a phosphate linker allowing them to bind simultaneously to an ATP and an AMP binding-site of an adenylate kinase. We hypothesized that Ap 5 A inhibits CFTR channel opening by interacting simultaneously with an ATP-and an AMP-site. To test this hypothesis, we labeled CFTR with a radioactive 8-azido-photoreactive analogue of ATP, [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -ATP, in the absence and presence of non-radioactive ATP or Ap 5 A. We then partially proteolized CFTR and fractionated the fragments on 16% tricine gels. We found that photolabeling of some CFTR fragments was prevented by both ATP and Ap 5 A. In other fragments labeling was prevented only by ATP. These results suggest that Ap 5 A competed with ATP, but not at all ATP binding-sites. To identify the ATP-site with which Ap 5 A interacts, we studied two CFTR variants with the single amino acid substitutions A462F and S1248F. These mutations introduced a phenylalanine residue into the phosphate-binding loop of either ATP-site 1 (A462F) or site 2 (S1248F). Therefore, the interaction of ATP (and Ap 5 A) with one ATP-site is impaired in these mutants: mutation A462F interferes with binding to ATP-site 1 and mutation S1248F with binding to ATP-site 2. Both CFTR mutants exhibited low channel open probabilities. Ap 5 A inhibited channel opening in A462F CFTR but not in S1248F CFTR, suggesting that Ap 5 A interacts with ATP-site 2. To test whether Ap 5 A interacts also with an AMPsite, we photolabeled CFTR with [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A, [\u03b3 32 P]8-N 3 -ATP, or [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -AMP and then studied labeling of proteolytic CFTR fragments. We found that [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A labeled a subset of those fragments that were also labeled by [\u03b3 32 P]8-N 3 -ATP. In addition, we identified a proteolytic digestion product that was labelled by [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A and [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -AMP but not by [\u03b3 32 P]8-N 3 -ATP, indicating that this CFTR fragment was part of the AMP binding-site. Non-radioactive ATP prevented labeling of this fragment by [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A but not by [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -AMP. These findings confirm that CFTR contains a binding-site for AMP that is distinct from the ATP binding-sites. The data further indicate that photolabeling of the AMP-site by [\u03b2 3 32 P]8-N 3 -Ap 4 A required simultaneous interaction of this compound with an ATP-site. Thus the results suggest that Ap 4 A/Ap 5 A interact with CFTR in a similar manner as with other adenylate kinases. Since our previous work showed that adding AMP or AMP analogues can increase or decrease CFTR current, identifying key amino acids that are involved in the interaction of AMP with CFTR may aid development of therapeutics useful for treating cystic fibrosis.",

The most common mutation, F508del, is located in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1, residues 389-673) where it confers a temperature sensitive phenotype to CFTR, decreases thermal stability of purified NBD1, and interferes with channel gating by disrupting intramolecular interactions between NBD1 and the second membrane spanning domain. CFTR NBD1 consists of three subdomains: an N-terminal ATP binding subdomain (residues 389-495), an alpha-helical subdomain (residues 495-564) and a mixed alpha, beta-sheet F1-type ATPase core. CFTR NBD1 also contains a unique unstructured regulatory insertion (RI) (residues 405-436) of uncertain function and a C-terminal regulatory extension (RE) (residues 656-673), the latter of which controls channel gating in response to phosphorylation. Recent studies have shown that RI deletion partially restores maturation, stability, and function of full-length F508del CFTR in cells. This suggests that the RI, located within the N-terminal subdomain, is functionally and structurally coupled to the folding defect induced by F508del in the alpha-subdomain.",

            "text": "Using a FRET-based approach, we recently showed that NBD1 folding is initiated co-translationally by rapid compaction of the N-terminal ATP binding subdomain. We therefore examined whether deletion of the RI might affect subdomain structure and/or alter the NBD1 co-translational folding pathway. To test this hypothesis, a donor, fluorophore (eCFP) was placed at the N-terminus of NBD1 (residue 389) via an in-frame N-terminal fusion. A small acceptor dye ([N-6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole]-Lys]) was co-translationally incorporated into the nascent chain at residue 450, using a synthetic suppressor tRNA. Because residue 450 is located in close proximity to the eCFP fusion site in the NBD1 crystal structure, the FRET efficiency provides a measure of the folded state of the N-terminus subdomain in the nascent polypeptide. As expected, RI deletion had no effect on FRET for nascent chains truncated prior to subdomain folding, i.e. residue 460 (FRET <10% for WT and RI deletion). In contrast, after the subdomain had exited the ribosome (truncation 550), RI deletion increased FRET from 45% to ~55%. This implies that the N-terminus subdomain achieves a more compact conformation in the absence of RI. FRET was also measured in the presence of a monoclonal antibody whose binding epitope overlaps with the RI (L12B4, residues 386-412) or a control antibody (M3A7). Addition of L12B4 (but not control) to the ribosome-bound subdomain resulted in a 33% decrease in the relative FRET efficiency (from 45% to 30%). These results suggest that RI structure induces subtle changes to the folded state of the NBD1 N-terminal subdomain. Effects of RI deletion on FRET efficiency to other regions of NBD1 are under investigation. (Supported by CFFT, NIH, and the Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation.) ",

Ophthalmology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Human syntaxin 8, a member of the t-SNARE receptor family, was originally cloned using the R domain of CFTR as bait in a yeast-two-hybrid screen of human fetal lung library (Thoreau et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 257:577-583, 1999) . Subsequent experiments showed that STX8 is involved in the post-Golgi, endosomal recycling pathway of wt CFTR. Over expression of STX8 has been shown to both disrupt the recycling of CFTR and inhibit chloride channel currents (Bilan et. al. J. Cell Sci. 117:1923 -1935 , 2004 . The aim of our study is to understand whether STX8 plays a role in the processing and trafficking of \u2206F508-CFTR. To accomplish this we cotranfected STX8 and \u2206F508-CFTR into Cos7 cells and noticed a dosedependent decrease in the steady state levels of the B band. Over expression did not cause any rescue of \u2206F508-CFTR to C band. To study this further, we determined the effect of cycloheximide (CHX) treatment to assess the rate of degradation of STX8 and its impact on \u2206F508-CFTR degradation. Our results showed that STX8 is a long-lived protein which is relatively stable over a 24 hr CHX treatment period. Treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 showed that STX8 is slowly degraded in the proteasome. Lysosomal inhibition with E64 did not have any effect suggesting that STX8 is not degraded in the lysosome. CHX treatment as expected showed that \u2206F508-CFTR is rapidly degraded. The rate of degradation of \u2206F508-CFTR was not noticeably changed when \u2206F508-CFTR and STX8 were coexpressed. Inhibiting the proteasome with MG132 caused a significant increase in the B band of \u2206F508-CFTR in the absence of STX8. This increase in the B band of \u2206F508-CFTR following proteasome inhibition still occurred in \u2206F508-CFTR and STX8 co-transfected cells. Our data shows that STX8 does affect the steady-state levels of the B band of \u2206F508-CFTR but does not affect its degradation in the proteasome. The data suggests that STX8 does play a role in the processing of \u2206F508-CFTR in the ER in addition to its known effects on recycling of wt-CFTR at the plasma membrane. One possibility is that STX8 might be involved in the early biogenesis of \u2206F508-CFTR.",

            "text": "Funded by CFFT Folding Consortium. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is comprised of two transmembrane spanning domains (TMDs), two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and a unique regulatory region (R). The domains obtain cotranslational structure that is required to interact with the other domains as they are produced and folded. The first domain translated, TMD1, forms extensive interdomain interactions with the other domains in CFTR homology models. In TMD1, long intracellular loops extend into the cytoplasm and interact with both NBDs via coupling helices and with TMD2 via transmembrane spans (TMs). In this study, mutations within this domain, either in a TM span or in the cytosolic ICLs, only become apparent in constructs containing different CFTR domains, suggesting they interfere with specific steps in the hierarchical folding of CFTR. TM1 CF-causing mutants, G85E and G91R, directly affect TMD1, whereas most ICL1 and ICL2 mutant effects became apparent only after TMD2 production. A single mutant in ICL2 altered levels only in the pres-ence of NBD2, suggesting it perturbs the ICL2-NBD2 interface. Notably, mutation of hydrophobic residues in the ICL coupling helices increased levels of pre-TMD2 biogenic intermediates, but caused ER accumulation in the presence of TMD2. This result suggests a tradeoff between transient stability during translation and final structure. NBD2 increased the efficiency of mutant trafficking from the ER, consistent with stabilization of the intact CFTR. While the G85E and G91R mutants in TM1 have immediately detectable effects, the influence of most of the studied mutants are apparent only after production of TMD2, suggesting this intermediate is a major point of recognition by protein quality control.",

            "text": "Ostedgaard, L. 1 ; Welsh, M. Studies of recombinant CFTR showed that the most common CF-associated mutation, \u2206F508, disrupts processing of the protein. The mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded, preventing glycosylation at the Golgi and maturation to the plasma membrane. Like human CFTR-\u2206F508 (h\u2206F), pig CFTR-\u2206F508 (p\u2206F) was mostly degraded. However, some p\u2206F escaped the ER and was processed to the fully glycosylated protein. Moreover, when expressed in a CF airway epithelial model or when studied in the airway of CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 pigs, p\u2206F generated a small amount of transepithelial Cltransport, suggesting that some of the \u2206F508 protein reached the apical surface. To begin to understand the basis for the small proportion of p\u2206F that matures, we did several studies to compare the biosynthesis of recombinant human and pig CFTR. We found that the disappearance of the band B form of human and pig wild-type CFTR and CFTR-\u2206F508 did not differ. However, maturation of pig wild-type CFTR (pWT) was greater than human wild-type CFTR (hWT). Furthermore, maturation of h\u2206F to band C was less than 2%, whereas maturation of p\u2206F was 15-20%. Processing of h\u2206F is temperature-dependent; reducing the temperature to 26\u00b0C caused a 4-5-fold increase in maturation of h\u2206F. In contrast, lowering the temperature did not increase the amount of p\u2206F band C. Disruption of the Golgi by Brefeldin A (BFA) prevents exit of protein from ER. In both hWT and pWT, a portion of band B accumulates in the ER after BFA treatment, the same proportion that processes to mature band C. In h\u2206F, there is no such accumulation. Unlike h\u2206F, a portion of p\u2206F accumulates in the ER, approximately the same proportion of the protein that becomes fully glycosylated. We also compared the trypsin sensitivity of pig and human wildtype and CFTR-\u2206F508 in membrane vesicles. In contrast to the marked sensitivity of h\u2206F to proteolysis, p\u2206F was only slightly more susceptible to trypsin than pWT. These in vitro studies indicate that a small portion of p\u2206F forms a relatively protease-resistant conformation that is less susceptible to degradation than h\u2206F. This stable form of p\u2206F is competent to leave the ER and enter the Golgi. Moreover, these data suggest that this small proportion of p\u2206F is able to overcome a step in ER processing that is temperature sensitive for h\u2206F. In addition, our studies suggest the feasibility of using differences in human and pig CFTR sequence to guide us to targeted therapies that could improve processing of human CFTR-\u2206F508. CFTR transgene expression in CF airway epithelial cells is characterized by a gradual decline over time. To circumvent this, novel strategies that prolong CFTR activity at critical threshold levels above 6-10% are therefore needed. Brief hyperthermic treatment (BHT; 41-43\u00b0C for 20-60 min) of the airways has been used in clinical studies and is known to induce heat shock protein 72 (iHsp72). Recent studies suggest that BHT might affect the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), and a regulatory link between HDAC7 and CFTR was described in CF bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE41o-; Hutt et al. 2010) . The goals of this study were i) to examine the utility of BHT as an enhancer of episomal CFTR expression using the pCEP4-CFTR plasmid, and ii) to quantify the efficacy of BHT as an enhancer of CFTR-mediated Cl currents in comparison to inhibitors of DNMTs and HDACs. CFBE41o-monolayers were grown on Snapwell inserts, exposed to BHT, and allowed to recover at 37\u00b0C for increasing time periods. Measurements of CFTR Cl currents (I Cl ) were carried out in the presence of a Cl gradient in Ussing chambers at specific time points. BHT induced time-dependent increases in iHsp72 protein expression and forskolin/VRT-532 stimulated I Cl (1. 4, 2.7, 4.0, and 4.7-fold after 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours, respectively) . BHT effects on I Cl were validated in three CFBE41o-clones complemented with the wtCFTR cDNA open reading frame (ORF; 4.7 kb) and in one CFBE41o-clone with the entire wtCFTR cDNA (ORF plus the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, UTR; ~6.2kb) inserted into the pCEP4 expression plasmid. Both the 4.7 kb and 6.2 kb constructs responded to BHT, and I Cl peaked at 161\u00b130 \u00b5A/cm 2 (4.7 kb) and 386\u00b130 \u00b5A/cm 2 (6.2 kb) suggesting that untranslated regions in the 6.2 kb CFTR sequence provide a 2-fold higher efficacy for the correction of CFTR activity in CFBE41o-cells. Treatment with actinomycin D abolished the response to BHT suggesting that BHT affects CFTR transcription. Conversely, exposure of the 6.2 kb clone to 5-aza-dC, a DNMT inhibitor, resulted in a time-dependent activation of I Cl similar to BHT, and I Cl peaked at 301\u00b143\u00b5A/cm 2 . Combined treatment of BHT and 5-aza-dC had no additive effects, suggesting that BHT and 5-aza-dC act through a similar mechanism. Treatment of the 6.2 kb clone with HDAC inhibitors for 24 hours was less effective than either BHT or 5-aza-dC, and I Cl peaked at 166\u00b114 \u00b5A/cm 2 (Trichostatin A), 135\u00b16.0 \u00b5A/cm 2 (SAHA), and 75\u00b11.0 \u00b5A/cm 2 (Scriptaid). In summary, the efficacy to enhance forskolin/VRT-532-stimulated I Cl was BHT (4.2-fold) > 5-aza-dC (3.3-fold) > trichostatin A (1.8-fold) > SAHA (1.5-fold) > Scriptaid (no effect). In conclusion, it appears that BHT and 5-aza-dC induce changes in CMV promoter methylation that lead to enhanced CFTR transgene expression. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the use of BHT may provide a novel means to enhance correction of CFTR function during gene transfer.

Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis disease; the major disease-causing mutation, F508del, is located in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1).

            "text": "Functionally important interdomain interfaces include: NBD1:ICL4, NBD1:2, NBD1:2:ICL1:2:4, ICL3:Regulatory-domain, and membrane spanning domain (MSD) 1:2. Identification of other interfaces along the pore axis of CFTR is desired. Upon inspection of Sav1866-based atomic homology models of CFTR, and using HOLE software, previously unexplored ICL interfaces (ICL1:2, ICL1:3) were predicted to play important roles in biosynthesis and gating. Further analysis identified a cluster of hydrophobic residues comprised of six ICL amino acids (all of which are located in the helical extensions, two of which are associated with disease) that may be involved in gating. These residues include: Ile177 (ICL1), Val181 (ICL1), Leu259 (ICL2), Val260 (ICL2), Leu973 (ICL3) and Val1056 (ICL4). Individually mutating Ile177 and Leu259, two residues which form the narrowest constriction in the putative permeation pathway, did not affect maturation (as shown by immunoblots), but the double substitution of Ile177Ala/Leu259Ala decreased the rate of functional activation by 40%, presumably by altering the ICL1:2 interface, as measured by a cell-based iodide efflux assay using the halide-sensitive fluorophore 6-methoxy-N- (3sulfopropyl) quinolinium. Substitution of the ICL3 residue Leu973 with disease-causing Pro, but not disease-causing Phe, affected CFTR processing, suggesting that a conserved residue is required at this position for proper assembly and maintenance of alpha-helical structure. Further characterization of these and other ICL mutants is currently in progress. By understanding how the ICLs transmit signals between the MSDs and NBDs via interdomain interfaces, gating mechanisms will become more apparent, and could potentially allow for the design of next generation correctors to treat cystic fibrosis by improving the folding/assembly of mutant CFTR. Elucidation of such molecular events would contribute not only to our understanding of CFTR activity, but also to our understanding of channels and transporters in general.

CFTR in particular is known to be regulated by multiple PTMs, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. The functional significance and specific CFTR residues responsible for the majority of PTMs within CFTR are not known. We recently employed a combination of tandem (MS/MS) and multiple reaction ion monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry using 4000 QTRAP and 5600 TripleTOF mass spectrometers (AB SCIEX, Concorde, Ontario, Canada) to globally identify specific positions of PTM within full length CFTR. Recombinant His-CFTR was expressed at high levels using an inducible teton lentivirus-based strategy in HEK293 cells. CFTR was purified from culture (10 liter bioreactors) using nickel affinity chromatography, fragmented by enzymatic digestion, and scanned for sites of modification. Using a variety of proteolytic enzymes and a source of CFTR comprising both properly folded and unfolded conformations, we achieved coverage of approximately 72% of the full length gene product. The proteomic survey revealed locations of numerous PTMs, including several modifications not previously reported for CFTR, such as methylation, ethylation, and palmitoylation. The analysis verified CFTR phosphorylation at S660, S686, S700, S712, S737, and S795, and also identified novel phosphate attachments at T717, S1444, and S1456. A putative site of CFTR ubiquitination, a modification known to participate in degradation from both the ER and plasma membrane compartments, was observed at K688. These results describe the first comprehensive analysis of PTMs within CFTR and will help elucidate mechanisms that govern ion channel trafficking and function.",

            "text": "Lipid modifications are known to play a crucial role during biogenesis of numerous membrane proteins, including receptor molecules, epithelial ion channels, and members of the ABC gene family. S-palmitoylation is a reversible lipid modification defined by the addition of palmitate, a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, to sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues. Using a mass spectrometry (MS) approach, we have established that CFTR undergoes S-palmitoylation at two positions: cysteine 524 (located within NBD1) and cysteine 1395 (in the C-terminal region of the protein). Metabolic labeling with [ 3 H]-palmitic acid was confirmed in both wildtype and F508del mutant forms of CFTR. Blocking attachment of palmitic acid with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) decreased levels of mature (Band C) CFTR in HeLa, HEK293, and CFBE (cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial) cells. In addition, anion transport as measured by the fluorescent indicator 6-methoxy-N-(3sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ) and studies of CFBE monolayers in the Ussing chamber showed significantly less CFTR surface activity following treatment with 2-BP. Treatment with 2-BP also blocked CFTR maturation as judged by [ 35 S]-pulse chase. While disruption of C1395 by replacement with alanine had no measurable effect on steady state levels of Band C, CFTR encoding C524A demonstrated a 90% decrease in the mature glycoform. C524 is located in the canonical \u03b1 helical subdomain of NBD1, arguing against a role in palmitate-dependent membrane association. Moreover, C524A misprocessing was partially rescued by low temperature in a manner similar to correction of F508del, indicating that this substitution may have direct effects on NBD folding. In either case, our results indicate that palmitoylation contributes to CFTR biogenesis as part of a previously unrecognized step in the maturational pathway. Identification of additional palmitoylation sites in CFTR by mass spectrometry will be necessary to clarify the role of this side chain attachment during CF pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Supported by CFF and NIH. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interacts with EBP50/NHERF1 via a C-terminal Post-synaptic density 95/Disc-Large/Zona occludens-1 (PDZ) binding motif (1). Proteins with PDZ domain-interacting motifs have well-established roles in protein scaffolding at the cell surface and are proposed to act as cis-acting determinants directing the molecular sorting of transmembrane cargo from endosomes to the plasma membrane. Recently, several groups have shown that overexpression of NHERF1 can localize mutant CFTR to apical membrane suggesting a potential therapy for CF (2) (3) (4) . To assess whether other regions of CFTR interact with NHERF1, we have been investigating how CFTR bearing the S1455X mutation that deletes the PDZ binding motif partially localizes to apical membrane. The present study was conducted to investigate whether NHERF1 overexpression affects the localization of S1455X CFTR. NHERF1 was transiently overexpressed in MDCK cells stably expressing GFP tagged S1455X CFTR. Plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated at 4\u00b0C using EZ-Link-Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and cells were warmed to 37\u00b0C for 2 .5, 5, 7.5, or 10 min to load endocytic vesicles with biotinylated proteins, including CFTR with Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin. There was no significant difference observed in the rate of endocytosis of S1455X. To evaluate recycling, cells were warmed again to 37\u00b0C at different time points to allow endocytosed and biotinylated CFTR to recycle to the plasma membrane. It was observed that overexpression of NHERF1 increased the recycling of internalized S1455X CFTR to the apical membrane. This finding was consistent with observations by confocal microscopy where the abundance of S1455X CFTR on the apical surface was increased in cells with NHERF1 overexpression. Since PDZ binding motif is absent in S1455X CFTR, these results suggest that NHERF1 overexpression and increased recycling operates via interaction with sequences other than the PDZ binding motif. We are currently exploring whether an internal C terminal sequence (1417EENKVR1422) previously proposed by our group to interact with NHERF1 (5) may play a role in the increased recycling. Elucidation of mechanisms that promote the recycling of CFTR may provide a path to increase the abundance of CFTR mutants at the cell surface.",

Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Rosalind Franklin University, North Chicago, IL, USA; 2. Physiology and Biophysics, Rosalind Franklin University, North Chicago, IL, USA Cystic fibrosis is caused by a loss in the expression of a chloride channel, CFTR. Of the patients with cystic fibrosis, 90% have a 3bp deletion, which eliminates codon 508 (F508del). This mutation alters CFTR folding such that CFTR does not get to the plasma membrane, but instead, is degraded by endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD). While the F508del mutation is commonly responsible for cystic fibrosis, little is known on why the mutation alters the folding of CFTR or how it can be corrected by a rational approach. The results in this study demonstrate that the expression and localization of both wild type and F508del CFTR are dramatically dependent on which synonymous codons are used in the open reading frame of CFTR. There is a striking dependence on the synonymous codon usage on the total amount of CFTR expressed in the cell, the trafficking to the plasma membrane, and on the level of functional CFTR for both the wild type and mutant, F508del, forms of CFTR. Surprisingly, by optimizing the synonymous codons, we are able to express the F508del form of CFTR on the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells at levels that are comparable to that observed by expression of wild type CFTR using the native codons.",

This report describes the results from a number of constructs including two that use the codon sequence of endogenous/native, wild type or F508del CFTR and two that that are strongly biased for high expression (high CAI). The constructs were integrated into a single site using the \"Flip-in\" system in HEK293 cells. Western blot analysis indicates expression of wild type CFTR increased by 15 fold for the hCAI constructs as compared to the native codons. Surprisingly, expression of CFTR F508del in the hCAI codons resulted in expression that was 2 fold higher than that observed for expression of wild type CFTR using native codons. Expression of codon optimized CFTR F508del in FRT cells showed a 20 fold increase in activity, as measured by forskolin induced current, in comparison to expression of CFTR F508del using the native codons. Analysis of the ratio of the relative amount of CFTR to the level of mRNA (Translation Efficiency, TE) indicates that the TE of the codon optimized CFTR F508del increased from near 0, to 0.075, as compared to a TE of 1 for wild type CFTR. Analysis of the RNA levels by real time PCR indicates that the level of mRNA closely tracks the level of protein expression, however the half-lives of the mRNA does not vary (t1/2 = 4hrs). While transcription is not expected to differ, we are currently undertaking nuclear run-on experiments to assess the promoter strengths for all the constructs. Overall, these results have profound implications on the coupling of translation and folding and on the effect of codon usage on translation and transcription in the mammalian cell.

The airway mucus gel performs a critical function in defending the respiratory tract from pathogenic and environmental challenges. In cystic fibrosis (CF), overproduction of mucus with abnormal transport properties is an important pathologic feature. Early changes in CF are characterized by adherence of mucus plaques to the airway epithelium, blocking small airways and providing an environment within which bacteria can flourish. This results in chronic inflammation and a vicious cycle of airway damage and mucus hypersecretion, key aspects of morbidity and mortality. The development of effective reagents targeted at reducing mucus adherence in CF is an important unmet clinical need. However, our current understanding of mucin biology is incomplete, particularly with regards to mucin assembly and how they are organized within mucus. To address these issues we have analyzed MUC5B in apical secretions and lysates from normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) grown at air-liquid interface, as well as from saliva.",

            "text": "Additionally, an important, and largely under-researched, aspect of airway mucus is the native structure and organization of mucins within the mucus gel. At least 250 proteins are present in airway mucus (3) , but how these components come together to result in functional mucus is not known. To investigate the organization of MUC5B within mucus, we have used cryo-electron tomography to generate a 3-D model of a MUC5B mucin network in its native physiological state. Using saliva, we have developed an effective method for sample preparation. Native mucin-complexes are subjected to centrifugal concentration using a 1MDa molecular weight cut-off centrifuge filter. After filtration, MUC5B is retained above the filter along with the majority of the lower molecular weight proteins in the secretion, indicating they are associated with MUC5B in mucus. Preliminary cryo-EM data on MUC5B-protein complexes reveals a network of interlinked fibres. We are currently using MUC5B-domain-specific antibodies in combination with cryo-EM to obtain new insight into the molecular organisation of the mucins within this network.

Despite the advancement in many areas of CF research, the pathogenesis of CF airway disease is still not well understood. This is, in part, due to the lack of an animal model with lung disease that resembles human CF disease. Therefore, a CF pig model was recently developed. Within months after birth, the CF pig developed lung disease similar to that observed in humans with CF. Interestingly, at birth CF pig airways were less circular than controls, had smaller diameters, had irregularly appearing cartilage rings, and contained abnormal appearing smooth muscle bundles. We hypothesized that these early airway structural abnormalities will affect airflow patterns and particle deposition in the CF airways. An in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was applied to study the effect of airway structural abnormality in CF newborn pigs on airflow pattern and particle deposition. The code uses parallel large-eddy simulation (LES) technique, which solves filtered continuity and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The two airway geometric models of a newborn CF and non-CF pig, were reconstructed from multi-row detector CT (MDCT: Siemens Sensation 64) image datasets. After analyzing the two geometric models we found that CF airways were less circular and smaller in diameter compared to the non-CF airways. When airflow in the upper airways was simulated using CFD the CF upper airways exhibited high turbulence intensity and high wall shear stress caused by the vortices created in the glottis. Moreover, in the CF airways we observed higher airflow velocity, and air pressure near the airway wall causing high wall shear stress compared to non-CF airways. We mathematically modeled airway particle deposition by releasing 1 \u00b5m particles evenly into the larynx above the glottis. We found that 24% of the particles went to the porpoise lobe in the CF lung compared to only 5% in the non-CF lung. In addition, we observed that in CF lung the number of particles deposited in the porpoise lobe was higher than the number of particles deposited in the left and right lung. Interestingly, in older CF pigs the lung disease tends to occur in the porpoise lobe. These data show that the CF airway structural abnormality has a significant effect on airflow pattern in the lung, and subsequently on particle deposition. The findings from this model suggest that early structural abnormality in the newborn CF airways might contribute to CF disease pathogenesis and be an important determinant of the regional distribution of CF lung disease. It has been recognized that mucociliary clearance is an integral part of lung defense. However, our understanding of the mechanism which regulates ciliary activities has been limited by our inability to capture ciliary motion and interactions between cilia and mucus in intact epithelia and in three dimensions. Current imaging modalities that study ciliary motion are either destructive (SEM) or lack anatomical information (video microscopy). We hypothesize that visualizing cilia motion and mucus transport in intact respiratory epithelia in three dimensions could yield new findings in a variety of important topics such as ciliary motion patterns and mechanosensitivity of respiratory epithelial cells.",

Previously we demonstrated that \u00b5OCT can be used to measure ciliary beat frequency, airway surface liquid depth, mucus transport rate, and periciliary layer depth, and demonstrated clear difference between CF and non-CF cultures and tissues. Here we show that using our \u00b5OCT system resting phase, recovery phase and effective phase in a ciliary beat cycle can be clearly recognized and quantified and is abnormal in CF, with a greater proportion of cilia in the effective position (30%, P<0.05). In addition, we observed that respiratory epithelial cells dynamically respond to mucus loads anticipated to occur in CF and other lung diseases by increasing CBF upon small degrees of periciliary layer compression by mucus in both fully differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (13%, P<0.005) and swine tracheal tissue (15%, P<0.005). In contrast, CF epithelia do not respond to mucus loads, likely due to interdigitation of mucus within the cilia that prevents increased CBF. Using dual imaging with Furo-2 to simultaneously detect intracellular Ca 2+ , we further identify that CBF acceleration in response to PCL compression is calcium dependent, providing a mechanistic basis for autoregulation of CBF.",

Future development of a catheter could allow three or fourdimensional imaging (three spatial dimensions and time) in vivo and provide new avenues for improving our understanding of activities of the motile cilia and the mechanisms by which mucociliary transport is disrupted in CF. In cystic fibrosis (CF) intestine, abnormal mucus accumulation leads to compromised innate immunity, impairment of absorption and obstructive disease. The major pathological features are goblet cell hyperplasia and accumulation of mucus with abnormal viscoelasticity. Both these features are recapitulated in the intestine of Cftr-null mice. Previous studies have shown that the small intestine of Cftr-null mice have abnormal populations of gram-negative bacteria, increased Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and low-grade inflammation (Clarke et al., Am. J. Physiol.: 286: G1050, 2004 Norkina, et al., Am. J. Physiol.: 286: G1032, 2004 Canale-Zambrano et al., Am. J. Physiol. 299: 381, 2010) . Therefore, we questioned whether goblet cell hyperplasia and abnormal goblet cell function in the CF intestine result from the abnormal endogenous environment of the intestine or are intrinsic properties of the Cftr-null epithelium. To investigate these questions, we compared goblet cell number and TLR-2/4 expression between wild-type and Cftr-null littermate mice in vivo and in regenerating primary 3D gel cultures of the intestinal epithelium (i.e., 'enteroids'). Sterile enteroid culture provides regenerating intestinal epithelium in the absence of luminal bacteria, inflammatory elements or systemic factors. Consistent with previous reports of TLR-4, Western blot analysis of freshly isolated intestinal epithelium indicated that TLR-2 was significantly up-regulated in the Cftr-null as compared to WT intestine (n =6 littermate pairs). Goblet cell counts of paraffin-embedded histological sections stained with PAS/AB were significantly greater in Cftr-null as compare to WT intestine, especially in the lower villus epithelium (n = 7 littermate pairs). Examination of the sections also revealed defective degranulation of Cftr-null goblet cells as indicated by the retention of PAS-positive masses within goblet cells that extended into the intestinal lumen. In contrast to the in vivo studies, goblet cell numbers, TLR-2 protein and TLR4 protein expression were not significantly different between WT and Cftr-null enteroid (n = 3, 8 and 5 littermate pairs, respec-tively). However, real-time video microscopy of Cftr-null enteroids during treatment with 100 \u00b5M carbachol revealed defective mucus release as indicated by mucus strands retained within the goblet cell body and extending into the crypt lumen to form refractile blebs. In WT enteroids, goblet cell degranulation occurred rapidly with brief \"flashes\" of refractivity within the crypt lumen. We conclude from these studies that goblet cell hyperplasia of the CF intestine is secondary to the abnormal endogenous environment (bacterial flora, inflammation) whereas defective mucus release by goblet cells is an intrinsic property of the Cftr-null epithelium. Supported by CFF and NIH. Abnormalities of airway surface liquid (ASL) are hypothesized to contribute to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. We previously found that newborn CFTR -/pigs manifest a host defense defect against bacteria, and with time they spontaneously develop lung disease like that in humans with CF. Therefore, we asked if CF pigs have abnormal ASL. We assessed ASL viscosity in differentiated primary cultures of porcine airway epithelia by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of FITCdextran. Diffusion of FITC-dextran was slower in ASL of CFTR -/than wildtype epithelia, suggesting an elevated ASL viscosity. Previous studies suggested that an altered ASL pH and/or HCO 3 concentration might change mucus properties. Electrical measurements across airway epithelia revealed that CFTR -/epithelia had markedly reduced HCO 3 secretion. We also measured ASL pH in differentiated cultures of airway epithelia using SNARFdextran and found that CFTR -/epithelia had a reduced pH. Methacholinestimulated ASL removed from the trachea and analyzed with a pH microsensor also revealed a reduced pH in CFTR -/animals. Likewise, pH was reduced in the lumen of the gallbladder of newborn CFTR -/pigs, another organ that shows abnormal mucus. Calculations of the HCO 3 concentration suggest a reduced concentration in CFTR -/-ASL and gallbladder contents. These results suggest that CF ASL has an increased viscosity that might be due to a reduced pH and/or HCO 3 concentration. Supported by CFF, NHLBI and HHMI.",

However, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms are inherently defective in individuals with CF at birth, or whether CF airways become more susceptible to infection due to altered host responses to inhaled pathogens (i.e., excessive inflammatory responses). In order to begin to address this question, we evaluated several mechanisms of innate immunity in the airway of the CFTR-/ferret. These animals are highly susceptible to lung infections early in life, suggesting defects in the basic pathways of innate immunity of the lung. We first evaluated mucociliary clearance in CF and non-CF neonatal ferrets. Ciliogenesis and submucosal gland development occurs post-natally in the ferret airway. Analysis of \u03b2 tubulin IV staining in the ferret trachea indicated that the apical epithelial surface is less than 10% ciliated at birth, but that this percentage increases to ~80% by 24 days of age. We analyzed the percentage of ciliation in the tracheal epithelium of CF ferrets and found no major differences in the development of ciliated cells in the trachea compared to wild-type animals. Mucociliary clearance rates were also similar for CF and non-CF kits until after the first week of life, suggesting that the progressive buildup of thickened mucus and/or dehydration of the airways, but not the absence of or specific dysfunction of ciliated cells, contributes to impaired airway clearance in CF animals. Analysis of bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BAL) indicated that neonatal ferrets lacked submucosal glandsecreted proteins important for bacterial killing, irrespective of genotype, and no difference in bacterial growth of several species in newborn ferret BAL was detected between wild-type and CF animals. However, direct challenge of newborn ferret airways and tracheal xenografts with P. aeruginosa showed that CF airways failed to eradicate infection. To assess the role of CFTR in this process, we transduced CF ferret tracheal xenografts with an adenoviral vector expressing ferret CFTR, and observed that this completely rescued bacterial killing. These xenograft experiments are particularly informative since they lack a CF immune system and mucociliary clearance, and can directly index CFTR function in the surface airway epithelium. In conclusion, we find that bacterial killing is defective in the CF ferret airway early in life. This mechanism of bacterial clearance requires CFTR, and does not appear to require large numbers of ciliated cells or submucosal glands. Correction of CFTR defects only in the surface airway epithelium of CF tracheal xenografts restored bacterial clearance, suggesting that gene targeting to this region may be sufficient to correct CF lung disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that defective function/expression of CFTR contributes to hyperactive innate immune response and delayed bacterial clearance upon infection of respiratory epithelia in cystic fibrosis (CF). The ongoing debate whether a defect in the innate immune response exists prior to infection has been fuelled by contradicting results obtained on genetically non-matched cell lines and CF animal models.",

This study may help to identify new molecular therapeutic drug targets to treat CF. Funded by NIH. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) forms biofilms that both prevent attack by white cells and also reduce mucociliary clearance in CF lungs. Production of PA biofilms is regulated by quorum sensing molecules including C12. In addition to regulating gene expression in PA, C12 also affects host cells. We tested the hypothesis that C12 produced by PA biofilms triggered apoptosis in airway epithelia. We examined synthetic purified C12 as well as biofilms of PAO1 and PAO1\u2206lasI (C12 deficient) for effects on airway epithelial cells -CaLu-3 (wtCFTR), JME (\u2206F/\u2206F) and primary airway epithelia (non-CF) -on Snapwell inserts for electrophysiology and imaging, on coverglasses for imaging or on plastic plates for biochemical assays. PA biofilms were grown on nylon membrane for 48 hours prior to application either directly onto the epithelial cells or as a suspension in sterile Ringers solution following removal from the membrane by vortexing. Adding synthetic C12 (50 \u00b5M) apically to confluent CaLu-3 monolayers caused transepithelial resistance to decrease nearly to zero over 1-1.5 hrs. Immunofluorescence showed that loss of barrier function was accompanied by, first, release of cytochrome C (cytoC) from mitochondria (mitos) into the cytosol and, next, degradation of tight junctions (loss of ZO1). As measured with targeted redox-sensitive GFP (roGFP), C12 caused (after 30-45 mins) the cytosol to become markedly oxidized, changes that were accompanied by leakage of ER-roGFP into the cytosol. C12 activated caspase 3/7 (beginning at 20 mins, max within 60 mins), and also caspases 8 and 9. C12 caused mito membrane potential (\u03c8 mito , JC-1 imaging) to depolarize by 50-100% within 5 mins. C12 also triggered increases in cytosolic [Ca] (Ca cyto , fura-2 imaging) within 5 mins. PAO1 but not PAO1\u2206lasI biofilms caused similar depolarization of \u03c8 mito and increases in Ca cyto . It is concluded that C12 induces apoptosis very rapidly in airway epithelia in the sequence, (i) depolarization of \u03c8 mito and release of Ca from the ER, (ii) permeabilization of the outer mito membrane that releases cytoC and also the ER that releases its oxidized contents, and (iii) activation of caspases 3/7, 8 and 9 and tight junction breakdown and loss of barrier function. Qualitatively similar results occurred in all cell types, suggesting that CFTR plays no direct role in controlling apoptotic responses to C12 and also that cell lines and primary cells respond similarly. Finally, the data suggest that [C12] in PAO1 biofilms is sufficient to trigger apoptosis-related depolarization of \u03c8 mito and increases in Ca cyto like those triggered by 10-50\u00b5M C12. C12 produced by PA biofilms may contribute to accumulation of apoptotic cells that cannot be cleared by macrophages in CF. Preventing pro-apoptotic effects of C12 in CF airways may be clinically beneficial. We have identified five small molecule compounds that prevent C12-triggered caspase activation. We will present results testing their efficacy in preventing the multiple C12-triggered proapoptotic steps identified. Support: CFF and CFRI. Viral respiratory infections are a common cause of pulmonary exacerbations and clinical decline in CF patients, and RSV is the most common viral respiratory infection encountered in the first year of life. In this study, we examined the effects of RSV infection on monolayer integrity in CFBE41o-cells stably expressing wt or F508del CFTR. Cells were cultured until monolayers had a resistance of ~ 1000 ohm.cm 2 , followed by infection with RSV2 (MOI of 1). Monolayer resistance was monitored following infection to assess integrity and tight junction status. Repeated measures ANCOVA was used to assess differences between groups across days with adjustment for baseline resistance. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine group-specific increasing and decreasing trends in resistance. An autoregressive lag-1 covariance structure with unequal group variances was used to account for longitudinal measurements of resistance for each group. Prior to RSV infection, CFBE41o-cells expressing wtCFTR had a resistance of 971.67\u00b112.72, and F508del CFTR transduced cells had a resistance of 990.83\u00b19.88 (P=NS). In the absence of RSV infection, both wtCFBE41oand F508del CFBE41o-monolayers demonstrated steady and parallel increases in resistance of 440.14\u00b137.19 and 515.24\u00b131.12 per day, respectively. RSV-infected F508del CFBE41o-monolayer resistance decreased by -236.62\u00b127.96 (P<0.0001) per day. Significant decreases were observed for days 1-2: -118.33\u00b1101.04 (P<0.0001) 2-3: -515.00\u00b1101.04 (P<0.0001) and 3-4: -288.33.\u00b1101.04 (P=0.0053) . RSV-infected wtCFBE41o-monolayers had a mixed pattern of change, increasing at a daily rate of +447.17\u00b159.80 (P<0.0001) for the first 4 days, then decreasing by -523.33\u00b170.51 (P<0.0001) per day for the remainder of the experiment. F508del CFBE41ocells with RSV infection had lower mean resistance than non-infected F508del CFBE41o-cells on days 2-6 (all P<0.0001). RSV-infected wtCF-BE41o-monolayers had lower mean resistance than non-infected wtCF-BE41o (days 3-6, P<0.0001 to 0.0294). RSV-infected F508del CFBE41omonolayers had decreased resistance compared to RSV-infected wtCF-BE41o-cells for days 2-6 (all P<0.0001). RSV-infected wtCFBE41o-and F508del CFBE41o-monolayers had lower mean resistance than non-infected monolayers (days 3-6, P<0.0001 to 0.0294). This difference increased by 588.58\u00b148.77 per day (P=0.0012). The reduction in resistance in F508del CFTR expressing cells was associated with enhanced pathologic change and syncytia formation. wtCFTR-expressing cells retained CFTR currents over four days of RSV infection [CFTRinh172-sensitive (10 \u00b5M) currents following forskolin/IBMX and genistein (50 \u00b5M) = -19.39 \u00b5A/cm 2 (3.40) in control cells, and = -8.79 \u00b5A/cm 2 (2.91) in RSV-infected cells], indicating that cellular regulation of wtCFTR was diminished but remained intact during RSV infection in the absence of a cellular immune response. The findings indicate that the absence of wtCFTR expression and function leaves human airway cells vulnerable to epithelial disruption by RSV, which may contribute to the more severe pulmonary manifestations seen in the CF airway during RSV infection.",

Cystic Fibrosis Research Lab, Stanford university, Stanford, CA, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF) , caused by defective CFTR function, includes severe sinonasal disease which may contribute to lung disease. Newly developed CF pigs provide models to study the onset of CF lung disease. We asked if glands from nasal turbinates of pigs are identical to tracheal glands and if CF glands show defective fluid secretion. Unexpectedly, we found that nasal glands differed from tracheal glands in five ways: they were smaller, more numerous (density per airway surface area), more sensitive to carbachol (EC 50 (nM), nasal (114 \u00b1 18) vs. tracheal (590 \u00b1 16)), more sensitive to forskolin (EC 50 (nM), nasal (1691 \u00b1 135) vs. tracheal (6635 \u00b1 1836)), and they were nonresponsive to Substance P, which is a potent agonist for tracheal glands. To determine if the secretory function of nasal glands is compromised in CF pigs, fluid secretion (rate; pl/min/gl) from newborn piglets (12 controls and 12 CF) was measured optically using digital imaging of mucus bubbles formed under oil. The secretion rate in CF piglets following 3 \u00b5M forskolin (0.6 \u00b1 0.3) was not significantly increased from the basal rate and was significantly less than responses of control piglets (9.2 \u00b1 2.2). CF piglet nasal glands also responded significantly less to stimulation with 1 \u00b5M carbachol (control (143. 5 \u00b1 35.5, n=7) vs. CF (52.2 \u00b1 10.3, n=9) ) and the combination (3 \u00b5M forskolin + 0.1 \u00b5M carbachol) (control (25.8 \u00b1 5.8, n=8) vs. CF (4.5 \u00b1 0.9, n=9)); We also compared CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 with CFTR -/piglets. The mean secretion forskolin-stimulated rate for the CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 piglets (1.4 \u00b1 0.8, n=4) was significantly greater than CFTR -/piglets (0.2 \u00b1 0.1, n=7). These findings reveal differences between nasal and tracheal glands and show that nasal gland fluid secretion is defective in CF pigs of both genotypes, with some spared function in CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 pigs.",

            "text": "Mucins are the principal macromolecular component of airway mucus and the gel-forming mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, dominate its rheological properties. Recent details regarding mucin maturation, secretion, and interaction with other proteins have generated novel hypotheses concerning the etiology of CF airway mucus obstruction and its role in CF pathogenesis. In Scnn1b-Tg mice, airway-targeted overexpression of the epithelial sodium channel \u03b2 subunit (\u03b2ENaC protein, Scnn1b gene) recapitulates many features of human CF pulmonary disease, including airway surface dehydration, impaired mucus clearance, bacterial infection, and chronic inflammation. We hypothesized that the lung phenotype in Scnn1b-Tg mice would be altered in the absence of gel-forming mucins and that these differences would provide evidence for mucin-specific functions. In this study, Muc5b knock-out mice were bred to Scnn1b-Tg mice, and the pulmonary phenotype was evaluated. Muc5b-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited significantly less mucus obstruction than their Muc5b-sufficient littermates, as measured morphometrically in AB-PAS stained lung sections (14\u00b13 vs. 7\u00b12 nl/mm 2 for 5 week-old Muc5b +/+ vs. -/-Scnn1b-Tg mice, n\u22657). Muc5b Western blots confirmed a gene dose-dependent reduction in Muc5b secretion (Muc5b +/+ mice > Muc5b +/-) and its complete absence in Muc5b -/mice. Intuitively, therapies aimed at reducing the mucin content of mucus are predicted to ameliorate airway obstruction. We tested this hypothesis by exploiting a Scnn1b-Tg mouse variant that exhibits extremely poor survival due to the severe mucus obstruction, i.e., FVB Scnn1b-Tg mice. Heterozygosity for Muc5b rescued the survival of FVB Scnn1b-Tg mice (from 10\u00b19% to 86\u00b110% at postnatal day 6, n=5 litters), indicating that reduction of secreted Muc5b levels can improve clearance and reduce obstruction. Although Muc5b-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited a beneficial reduction in airway mucus plugging, they also exhibited more robust neutrophilia (23\u00b15 vs. 48\u00b18 neutrophils/mL BALF\u00d710 3 , for 5 week-old Muc5b +/+ vs. -/-Scnn1b-Tg mice, n\u22657) and higher incidence of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT, 0.0016\u00b10.001 vs. 0.023\u00b10.005 mm 2 /lung section, for Muc5b +/+ vs. -/-Scnn1b-Tg mice, n=8). This increased inflammatory signature was present even though the bacterial burden in adult Muc5b-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice was similar to Muc5b-sufficient littermates. We are currently testing whether absence of Muc5b influences the burden/composition of lung microflora in neonatal Scnn1b-Tg mice, and whether the immunophenotype of lung lymphocytes in adult mice can provide clues for the immune imbalance caused by Muc5b deletion. We hypothesize that this \"adverse\" outcome may reflect a role for Muc5b in organizing an antiinflammatory host defense network. As pharmaceutical strategies aimed at reducing mucin secretion are being evaluated to treat airway mucus obstruction in CF, we believe that our genetic approach to testing risk/benefit of this strategy is warranted.

People with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) are predisposed to a continuous cycle of lung infections and a disproportionate neutrophil dominated response. As a result, PWCF incur numerous pulmonary exacerbations, which results in progressive decline of lung function. Pulmonary exacerbations in PWCF are currently defined by a variety of clinical criteria. The use of inflammatory biomarkers represents a potential diagnostic tool to help indicate an increased state of inflammation in PWCF and provide an objective addition to the clinical criteria defining exacerbations in PWCF. Recent work by our group has shown that chemokines such as IL-8 induce the rapid shedding of a novel marker of neutrophil priming, CD16b-alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) complex, from the neutrophil membrane [1] . Neutrophil priming is a prerequisite prior to neutrophil migration towards the lung. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of CD16b-AAT in serum as a bioactive biomarker of IL-8 priming as an indicator of the inflammatory status of PWCF.",

The purpose of this study was to determine acid and base secretion in freshly excised human nasal tissues from \u2206F508 CF patients. Human nasal mucosa was collected during sinus surgery from normal subjects and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients with and without CF. Tissues were mounted in Ussing chambers and the mucosal equilibrium pH values and the rate of acid and bicarbonate secretion into the mucosal medium were determined using the pH-stat technique. Acid secretion was measured in bicarbonate free conditions at a mucosal pH of 8.0 (to increase driving forces) and base secretion was measured with 25 mM serosal bicarbonate/CO 2 and a mucosal pH of 6.0 (to inhibit H + secretion). The equilibrium pH of nasal epithelia from patients with CRS from \u2206F508/\u2206F508 CF patients (pH=7.08\u00b10.09, N=6) was significantly lower compared to nasal epithelia from CRS without CF (pH =7.33\u00b10.06, N=5, p = 0.041) or normal subjects (pH=7.33 \u00b1 0.06, N=7).

We are particularly interested in the influence of \u2206F508-CFTR correctors on ENaC trafficking and functional expression. Previous work suggests that the prototype \u2206F508-CFTR corrector, 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), can differentially alter the expression of highly homologous 70kDa heat shock proteins Hsc70 and Hsp70 (Rubenstein and Zeitlin, Am J Physiol Lung, 2000; Choo-Kang and Zeitlin, Am J Physiol Lung, 2001) . Furthermore, the 4PBA-mediated decrease in Hsc70 expression, and increase in Hsp70 expression could both promote correction of \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking. Because of the similarities in trafficking between ENaC and CFTR, we hypothesized that ENaC trafficking is also regulated by Hsc70 and Hsp70.",

            "text": "Our group's previous studies of ENaC regulation in Xenopus oocytes demonstrated that Hsc70 and Hsp70 had opposite effects on ENaC function and surface expression. Hsc70 overexpression decreased ENaC expression, while Hsp70 had the opposite effect (Goldfarb et al., PNAS, 2006 ). Here, we tested whether these findings were relevant in epithelial cells, and further probed the mechanism underlying these differential effects. We selected MDCK epithelial cells that stably express \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-ENaC and have tetracyclineinducible overexpression of Hsp70. We found that Hsp70 overexpression increased ENaC functional expression (amiloride-sensitive Isc) in Ussing chambers. This increase in functional expression correlated with increased surface expression of ENaC in biotinylation experiments, suggesting that the increased current resulted from an increase in ENaC channels at the apical surface. Hsp70 overexpression did not alter the rate at which functional ENaC was retrieved from the cell membrane, suggesting that delivery of channel to the membrane was responsible for the increased surface expression. In addition, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Hsp70 overexpression increased ENaC's association with the Sec24D cargo recognition component of the COP II ER exit complex. These data support the hypothesis that Hsp70 increases ENaC functional and surface expression in epithelial cells by promoting ENaC's exit from the ER and trafficking to the apical surface. This research is supported by grants T32 DK-07748 to RAC and R01 DK-58046 to RCR. The epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) is a key regulator of airway surface liquid. In the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway, hyperactivity of ENaC is hypothesized to cause impaired mucociliary clearance and portend bacterial colonization of the airway. In our group's studies of the correction of \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking by 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), we identified a novel 29 kDa molecular chaperone in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ERp29, that had increased abundance in CF epithelial cells after treatment with 4PBA, and that promoted trafficking of both WT and \u2206F508 CFTR (Suaud, et al, JBC, 2011) . ERp29 is homologous to thioredoxin proteins, which are enzymes that catalyze the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bridges. However, ERp29 has only a single cysteine residue (C157) and lacks the C-X-X-C motif that is characteristic of the thioredoxins. We tested the hypotheses that ERp29 would regulate ENaC trafficking, and that its single cysteine, C157, would have a critical role in ERp29's regulation of ENaC. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, co-injection of ERp29 RNA with \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-ENaC RNA caused a ~2-fold increase in amiloride-sensitive whole oocyte current compared with oocytes injected with \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-ENaC RNA alone, suggesting that ERp29 can regulate ENaC functional expression. To further examine ERp29 function in epithelial cells, we selected ENaC-overexpressing MDCK cell lines with tetracycline-inducible expression of either WT ERp29 or ERp29 where C157 was mutated to serine (C157S ERp29). In Ussing chambers, induced overexpression of WT ERp29 caused an increase in amiloride-sensitive Isc, or ENaC functional expression. In contrast, overexpression of C157S ERp29 caused a decrease in amiloride-sensitive Isc. These opposite effects correlated with the influence of WT or C157S ERp29 on the whole cell expression of \u03b2-ENaC and the cleaved form of \u03b3-ENaC. Overexpression of WT ERp29 increased whole cell expression of \u03b2-ENaC and the cleaved form of \u03b3-ENaC, while overexpression of C157S ERp29 decreased whole cell expression of these species. In contrast, siRNA-mediated depletion of ERp29 decreased \u03b2-ENaC expression, but did not alter \u03b3-ENaC expression. We also tested the influence of C157S ERp29 on the fraction of cleaved, higher Po versus uncleaved, lower Po ENaC at the apical surface by addition of trypsin in Ussing chambers. Application of 10 \u00b5g/mL trypsin to the apical surface of MDCK cells overexpressing ERp29 C157S cells caused a significantly greater fractional increase of amiloride-sensitive Isc compared to the control cells, suggesting that C157 influences ENaC cleavage. Finally, WT or C157S ERp29 overexpression increased the recovery of \u03b2-ENaC after immunoprecipitation of ERp29. These data support the hypothesis that ERp29 interacts with ENaC and can regulate its functional expression by regulating ENaC trafficking and/or subunit proteolysis and that C157 is critical for the regulation of ENaC by ERp29, but is not a determinant of ERp29's interaction with ENaC.",

Department of Physiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada Airway submucosal glands contribute most of the mucins and antimicrobial factors in the upper airways, which are important for the lung host defense. Airway submucosal glands are complex structures that consist of four parts: serous acini, mucous tubules, collecting duct, and ciliated duct. The serous acini express high levels of CFTR and generate most of the fluid secreted by the glands. In CF patients, secretion by the submucosal gland is abnormal. CF submucosal glands fail to produce mucus in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide and substance P and produce mucus that is more acidic and viscous. Thus, CF airways suffer from reduced delivery of antimicrobial factors and mucus, which would abate mucociliary clearance and facilitate infection with bacteria. However, the effect of inhalation of bacteria on submucosal gland mucus secretion is not fully understood. Inhaled pathogens trigger the release of proinflammatory signals including the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. Our objective is to study the effects of IL-1\u03b2 on submucosal gland mucus secretion and the role of CFTR. The data show that IL-1\u03b2 stimulates submucosal gland mucus secretion through CFTR-dependent mechanism. Stimulation with IL-1\u03b2 (50 ng mL -1 ) increased mucus secretion rate from 60 \u00b1 25 pL min -1 to 134 \u00b1 30 pL min -1 . Incubation with CFTRinh172 (100 \u00b5mol L -1 ) reduced IL-1\u03b2-stimulated secretion rate to 80 \u00b1 10 pL min -1 . Our data also show that IL-1\u03b2 stimulation triggers a cAMP intracellular second messenger pathway. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase with the blocker SQ22536 (0.5 mmol L -1 ) reduced mucus secretion by IL-1\u03b2-stimulated submucosal glands from 134 \u00b1 30 pL min -1 to 44 \u00b1 6 pL min -1 while treatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (1 mmol L -1 ) increased mucus secretion to 231 \u00b1 41 pL min -1 . Moreover, our experiments show IL-1\u03b2 stimulates ion transport across the serous acini. We directly measure the movement of Na + , K + , and Clacross the serous acini in isolated submucosal glands from swine using Scanning Ion-selective Electrode Technique (SIET). When IL-1\u03b2 was applied the serous acini display an increased uptake of Na + and Clwhile K + flux was unchanged. The results indicate that IL-1\u03b2 stimulates CFTR-mediated transport, suggesting that this response may be lost in CF airways resulting in reduced delivery of antimicrobial factors and facilitating infection. The data also show that IL-1\u03b2 stimulates Na + and Cltransport across the serous acini of airway submucosal glands, thus driving mucus secretion. This is the first direct measurement of ion transport across a single anatomical domain of the submucosal glands. In the future, we plan to use the same technique to determine the role of the other segments of the gland and their possible role in modulating the ion composition of the secreted fluid.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Cellular oxidative stress biomarkers are significantly elevated in patients with bronchiectasis compared to controls. Few differences exist between the different groups of patients. TGF-beta is a pleiotropic signaling molecule that regulates tissue response to injury, and has been demonstrated to modify the CF phenotype. The mechanism by which TGF-beta influences CF, however, is unknown. We hypothesized that TGF-beta may regulate Cltransport pathways relevant to CF, potentially providing a mechanism to modify the CF phenotype. We tested the effect of TGF-beta on the two dominant Cltransport pathways expressed in many CF affected epithelia, focusing on effects in colonic enterocytes (T84 cells) that both express CFTR and TMEM16A. Cells were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated permeable supports (Costar Transwell filters) until they achieved high resistance (>1000 ohm.cm 2 ). Cells were then serum starved for 24 hours (MEM media + 0.1% FBS), and subsequently exposed to 5 ng/mL TGF-beta for 48-72 hours. Monolayers were studied in Ussing chambers under voltage clamp conditions. To activate CFTR currents, T84 cells were stimulated with forskolin/IBMX (10/100 \u00b5M) followed by carbachol (100 \u00b5M, serosal). Cells were then treated with CFTRinh172 (10 \u00b5M, mucosal) to confirm CFTR-dependence of currents. To activate TMEM16A, cells were stimulated with ionomycin (2 \u00b5M) , and all studies were performed in symmetric Ringers solution + 25 mM HCO 3 . Following completion of the functional studies, cells were lysed and stored in RNA later at -80 o C, and expression was quantified by real time RT-PCR. Primers for hCFTR or hTMEM16A were designed by using Primer3 software or from published data and purchased from IDT. TGFbeta treatment (5 ng x 48 hrs) reduced mean (SD) forskolin/IBMX currents from 44.85 \u00b5A/cm 2 (5.4) to 20.38 (2.81) \u00b5A/cm 2 , and forskolin/IBMX+CCh-stimulated currents from 172.12 (10.83) to 75.68 (11.02) \u00b5A/cm 2 (P<0.005 for both stimulated currents). TGF-beta treatment reduced TMEM16A currents from 122 \u00b5A/cm 2 (27) to 2 \u00b5A/cm 2 (42) (P=0.008). CFTR and TMEM16A transcripts in T84 cells were also reduced by TGF-beta treatment for 72-hour treatment (~90% and ~50%, respectively, P<0.001), and TGF-beta treatment also led to histone modifications. In control studies conducted in wtCFTR-transduced CFBE41o-cells (lentiviral transduction of cells with wtCFTR cDNA under control of the CMV promoter, with undetectable expression of chromosomal F508del CFTR), TGFbeta treatment had no effect on either transduced CFTR currents or CFTR transcript levels. The results indicate that TGF-beta treatment of polarized colonocytes expressing chromosomal CFTR and TMEM16A rapidly reduced expression and function of both Clchannels. The inhibitory effects were transcriptional and limited to native expression of both Clchannels, pointing towards TGF-beta regulation of CFTR and TMEM16A through promoter or chromatin modification.",

            "text": "The CF lung expresses a profound proinflammatory phenotype, due to especially constitutive hypersecretion of IL-8 from airway epithelial cells in response to microbial infection. Since overproduction of IL-8 in CF ultimately contributes to massive bronchial infiltrates of neutrophils, identification of the pathways underlying IL-8 induction could provide novel drug targets for treatment of neutrophil-dominated inflammatory diseases such as CF. Recent reports indicate increased expression of IL-17A and its CD4 + T cell subset source, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and sputum from bacterially infected CF patients. IL-17A overproduction has been shown to be associated with the pathophysiology of multiple inflammatory diseases that involve induction of chemokines such as IL-8. In this study we evaluate whether IL-17A is responsible for neutrophil inflammation in CF airways during bacterial infection. The studies show that IL-17A and KC (an IL-8 homologue) were upregulated after a 24h intratracheal exposure to bacteria-derived peptidoglycan (PGN) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in homozygous Cftr mutant (F508del-CFTR)expressing mice (Cftr tm1eur BL/6) compared to their wild-type littermate mice (N=3-4, P<0.05). A positive correlation was observed between IL-17A and KC expression (N=24, R 2 =0.984, P<0.001). Further, neutrophil recruitment was increased in the PGN-or LPS-treated Cftr F508del/F508del mice compared to normal, suggesting that IL-17A may be a key molecule for the induction of bacteria-induced neutrophil-associated CF inflammation in vivo. Notably, IL-17A induced IL-8 expression in human airway epithelial cell lines derived from an F508del/F508del CF patient (CFBE41o-) and an F508del/W1282X CF patient (IB3), but not in human non-CF airway cell lines, 16HBE14o-and A549 cells, implying a CF airway-specific induction of IL-8 by IL-17A. Moreover, co-treatment of the CF airway cell lines with IL-17A and PGN or LPS significantly enhanced IL-8 expression. The synergistic effects observed appeared to be due to enhanced PGN-or LPSinduced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (MAPK). Taken together, these studies provide evidence that IL-17A is a critical factor in increasing IL-8 expression in bacteria-infected CF airways possibly via a positive cross-talk with p38 MAPK.",

Lung function tests with spirometry or body plethysmography deliver only global information while EIT detects also regional ventilation. EIT is a practical method to measure the inhomogeneity of ventilation distribution and has the potential to be a routine diagnosis tool for CF patients. Background: Abnormal regulation of airway epithelium sodium channels (ENaC) result in surface dehydration which is a key contributor to the development of chronic bacterial infection seen in CF, through the build-up of retained airway secretions (mucus). Recently it has become abundantly clear that proteolytic processing of ENaC subunits by channel activating proteases (CAPS) is associated with dramatically stimulated channel activity. However, at present the role of CAPS on ENaC function is poorly defined in CF bronchial epithelium. To this end our group has developed active site-directed affinity probes which target trypsin-like proteases. As well as determining the effect of protease inhibition on ENaC activity the presence of a reporter group (biotin) on these affinity probes enables the detection, visualisation and affinity purification of the captured proteases.",

Thus, consistent with our earlier work, the downstream inhibitory effect on I\u03baB\u03b1 is independent of the mutation state of CFTR. In addition, in studies with a DNAbased NF\u03baB reporter construct fused to luciferase, we find that TNF\u03b1-causes a profound increase in NF\u03baB promoter activity, which is potently inhibited by both oleandrin, and digitoxin. Finally, we co-transfected IB3-1 cells with both the NF\u03baB-reporter construct and plasmids expressing TNFR1, TRADD, and other canonical elements in the TNF\u03b1/NF\u03baB signaling pathway. In this case, the most profound increases in NF\u03baB signaling were found when the IB3-1 cells were transfected with TNFR1 and TRADD, both of which were profoundly and potently inhibited by either oleandrin or digitoxin. To identify the components of the TNFR1 Signaling Complex most affected by the cardiac glycosides, we treated CF IB3-1 and repaired IB3-1/S9 cells with exogenous TNF\u03b1, and immunoprecipitated the resulting signaling complex with anti-TNFR1.

Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center, Univ North Carolina Chapel Hil, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Mucin secretion into the airway lumen is regulated by calcium-dependent exocytosis of specialised granules from epithelial goblet cells. Imbalance of mucin secretion leads to mucus accumulation in the airway lumen and the development of severe CF lung disease. Specific protein complexes are recruited to regulate the exocytosis of the mucin granule, but the SNARE exocytotic core have not been defined in airway goblet cells. In this study, we identify VAMP8 as one of the SNAREs regulating mucin granule exocytosis. VAMP8 mRNA was expressed in human airway tissues, lung, and airway epithelial cells, and deep-sequencing and expression analyses of airway epithelial cells revealed that the VAMP8 transcripts were expressed >10 times higher than other VAMP mRNAs. VAMP8 was immunolocalised mainly to goblet cell mucin granules in human airway epithelial cell cultures and freshly-excised tissues. The function of VAMP8 in airway mucin secretion was tested by RNA interference techniques. Three independent siRNAs and shRNAs targeting VAMP8, reduced mucin secretion induced by PAR agonists, neutrophil elastase, and ATP in two airway epithelial cell culture models. Basal (non-agonist elicited) mucin secretion was also reduced in these experiments. Notably, VAMP8 knockdown was effective in decreasing mucin secretion in airway epithelial cell cultures with induced mucous metaplasia/mucin hypersecretion. Unlike VAMP8 silencing, knockdown of VAMP2 or VAMP3 did not affect mucin secretion. Our data suggest that VAMP8 is an essential SNARE in airway mucin granule exocytosis. Reduction of VAMP8 activity/expression may provide a novel therapeutic target to ameliorate airway mucus obstruction in lung diseases. In previous studies, we showed that the \u2206F508-CFTR mutation enhances the iron concentration inside CF-derived airway epithelial cells and in the apical medium of CF-derived airway cells, which stimulates the formation of antibiotic-resistant biofilms by P. aeruginosa on live human airway epithelial cells (1). To identify the mechanism(s) involved in enhanced iron accumulation and release observed in CF cells, compared to WT-corrected cells, we tested the hypotheses that the expression of DMT1, the major divalent metal transporter involved in human iron metabolism, and ferroportin, the only known iron exporter in human cells, were altered by the \u2206F508-CFTR mutation. Western blot analysis revealed that CFBE+\u2206F508 cells and their isogenic WT-corrected counterpart (CFBE+WT) constitutively express an 80-90 kDa DMT1 isoform. Surprisingly, CFBE+\u2206F508 cells also express an additional DMT1 isoform with an apparent molecular mass of 70-80 kDa. Upon deglycosylation, the molecular masses of both isoforms shifted to ~50 \u00b1 2 kDa, in accordance with the predicted masses of the (+)IRE and (-)IRE isoforms of DMT1. When the cDNA for the DMT1(+)IRE was expressed in CFBE+WT cells, DMT1(+)IRE located to the apical membrane, as shown by cell surface biotinylation, and resulted in enhanced intracellular iron accumulation compared with cells transformed with an empty vector (4.19 \u00b1 1.17 vs 1.80 \u00b1 0.67 \u00b5g/g respectively), as measured by ICP-MS. CFBE+\u2206F508 cells also constitutively express ~3 times more ferroportin protein than CFBE+WT cells. Overexpression of the DMT1(+)IRE isoform in CFBE+WT cells enhanced protein expression of ferroportin at the apical membrane and led to a 1.5-fold increase in iron release into the apical medium compared with cells transfected with an empty vector. Furthermore, overexpression of the (+)IRE isoform in CFBE+WT cells enhanced biofilm formation at the apical surface of these cells. The (+)IRE isoform expressed in CFBE+WT cells increased P. aeruginosa biomass compared to CFBE+WT cells expressing the vector alone (1.59 \u00b1 0.10 vs 1.10 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5m3/\u00b5m2 respectively, P=0.0009).",

(2008) Abnormal mucus formation and consequent obstruction of the small airways is the foremost cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Since the discovery of Cl \u2212 impermeability, CF pathology has largely been recognized as a defect in epithelial Cl \u2212 transport. However, loss of bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212 ) transport also plays a major role, especially in the pancreas where the absence of HCO 3 \u2212 secretion leads to the destruction of the organ. In other organs, reduced HCO 3 \u2212 transport may cause pathological changes in CF. In duodenum, bile duct, small intestine, and female reproductive tract, CFTR also supports HCO 3 \u2212 secretion and in an early study, Smith and Welsh (1992) reported that HCO 3 \u2212 secretion is through an apical CFTR that is defective in CF cultured airway cells. However, whether HCO 3 \u2212 is secreted in native small airways is not known. We have developed a novel, micro-Ussing system to investigate the properties of HCO 3 \u2212 transport in native porcine small airways and shown that the small airways are capable of secreting HCO 3 \u2212 when stimulated with cAMP and Ca 2+ mediated agonists. We assayed HCO 3 \u2212 transport indirectly as the equivalent short circuit current (I sc eq ) with bilateral 25 mM HCO 3 \u2212 plus 125 mM NaGlu Ringers' in presence of amiloride (10 \u00b5M) in the lumen and stimulated with different agonists. With apical Fsk (10 \u00b5M) plus IBMX (100 \u00b5M), PGE2 (1 \u00b5M), UTP (100 \u00b5M), ATP (100 \u00b5M) and Isoproteronol (ISP,10 \u00b5M), increased I sc eq significantly by (mean \u00b1 S.E.) 13.8 \u00b1 3.2 (n=10), 20.9 \u00b1 5.7 (n=7), 8.3 \u00b1 1.5 (n=5), 15.5 \u00b1 3.2 (n=4) and 9.6 \u00b1 1.4 (n=4) \u00b5A/cm 2 respectively (Table) . We tested for the inhibition by known blockers GlyH-101 (50 \u00b5M), DIDS (100 \u00b5M) and acetazolamide (100 \u00b5M) and measured the changes of transepithelial potential (V t ), conductance (G t ) and I sc eq . Since there is no permeable anion other than HCO 3 \u2212 , the changes in I sc eq following stimulation and effectively blocked by inhibitors provide strong indirect evidence of HCO 3 \u2212 transport in small airway epithelia (Table) . These results also suggested that HCO 3 \u2212 secretion is physiologically regulated, which may have a critical role in abnormal mucus clearance in CF affected organs (Quinton, 2010) .",

Little is known about the biologic properties that regulate these nucleotide label-retaining (LRC) progenitor cells or how CFTR defects may influence homeostatic properties of this niche. We discovered that calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) activates CFTR-dependent SMG secretions and that this signaling pathway is hyperactivated in the absence of CFTR in humans, pigs, ferrets, and mice. Since CGRP expressing neuroendocrine cells are known components of distal airway progenitor LRC niches, we investigated whether dysregulated CGRP expression in CF SMGs might alter properties of progenitor cells in the glandular niche. In wild-type mice, transient induction of glandular CGRP following airway injury induced SMG progenitor cell proliferation, while maintaining glandular retention of LRC progenitors with a highly proliferative phenotype in vitro. By contrast, CFTRdeficient mice with persistent dysregulated CGRP expression failed to maintain glandular LRC progenitors and formed adaptive niches in the surface airway epithelium where the highly proliferative LRC progenitors resided.",

The CGRP receptor components (RAMP1 and CLR) were expressed in SMGs, but rarely localized to glandular LRCs, suggesting that CGRP acts to regulate slow cycling progenitors through paracrine effectors. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CGRP-dependent pathways for CFTR activation are abnormally upregulated in CF SMGs and that the sustained mitogenic signals caused by elevated CGRP expression alters properties of the SMG progenitor cell niche in CF airways. This discovery may have important implications for injury/repair mechanisms in the CF airway. As a result of abnormal CFTR production/function there is limited chloride secretion into the airways of CF patients leading to dehydration of the pericilliary layer and the formation of thick mucus characteristic of the CF lung. However, other chloride channels exist which may be able to compensate for the defective chloride conductance seen in CF cells. One such channel, which is highly permeable to chloride, mediates the ubiquitous Volume Regulated Anion Current (VRAC), which is highly permeable to chloride. VRAC normally functions in cells to maintain cell volume through Regulatory Volume Decrease (RVD), in combination with other ion channels, but it can be activated independently of volume increase by receptor agonists (Zholos et al., 2005) . By exploiting the chloride secreting properties of VRAC, it may be possible to thus restore airway hydration in CF.",

Hyperabsorption of sodium across CF airway epithelium was identified over twenty years ago and is a key factor in the progression of airway disease. Much has been learned about mechanisms regulating the function of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), but why sodium transport is specifically increased in CF and how its regulation relates to CFTR function has remained largely elusive. Earlier data suggest that the presence of functional CFTR inverted the cAMP-PKA regulation of ENaC from positive regulation to negative regulation. We have recently reported that the loss of CFTR function triggers a feedback response in epithelial cells leading to increased cAMP signaling that results in cholesterol accumulation. We demonstrated in this work that the cAMP binding competitor Rp-cAMPS reverses cholesterol accumulation to wt distribution. Previous data demonstrating the impact of Rp-cAMPS on cholesterol processing in CF leads to the hypothesis that cholesterol processing contributes to hyperabsorption of sodium across CF airway epithelium. Given the broad impact of Rp-cAMPS in CF epithelial cells and mouse models on CF cell biology, we were interested in determining if Rp-cAMPS could influence amiloride-sensitive transepithelial potential difference (TEPD) in CF mice. Preliminary data demonstrate that treatment of Cftr-/-mice for 12 days with 5 mg/kg/day Rp-cAMPS via osmotic pump reduces amiloride sensitive transepithelial potential difference to wt levels. Baseline TEPD in Cftr-/-mice is reduced from -19.2 +/-2.7 mV in untreated mice to -7.7 +/-0.8 mV (n=6) in Rp-cAMPS treated mice (p < 0.001). The \u2206amiloride is reduced from 10.8 +/-0.6 mV to 4.3 +/-0.8 mV (p < 0.01). Membrane cholesterol content in Rp-cAMPS treated mice is reduced to near wt levels, supporting a possible role of cholesterol in this phenotype. In cellular studies, statin treatment of primary renal collecting duct epithelial cells significantly reduces amiloride-sensitive base-line Isc from 28.9 +/-4.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 to 15.7 +/-1.8 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=7, p < 0.01). The \u2206amiloride is reduced from 25.0 +/-3.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 to 12.5 +/-1.2 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=7, p < 0.01) in the presence of mevastatin suggesting sodium transport is being influenced. This reduction is reversible by adding back mevalonate. Studies examining Cftr-/-mice also lacking the cholesterol processing protein NPC1 (Cftr/Npc1 DKO mice) demonstrate a clear reduction in baseline TEPD compared to Cftr-/-mice. Baseline TEPD is reduced from -22.9 +/-1.7 mV in Cftr-/-mice (n=8) to -10.0 +/-0.6 mV in Cftr/Npc1 DKO mice (n=4; p < 0.001). These data demonstrate that secondary effects of the loss of CFTR function on cholesterol processing likely contribute to the phenotype of hyperabsorption of sodium.

            "text": "Ballard, S.T.; Cooper, J.L. Department of Physiology, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, USA Sputum from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients contains an unusually high percentage (\u226510%) of non-volatile solids. This abnormally thick mucus is thought to be generated by excessively high rates of salt and water absorption across the airway surface epithelium. Because normal porcine tracheal epithelium and CF human nasal epithelium absorb Na + at very similar rates, we tested the hypothesis that porcine tracheas are capable of concentrating native mucus to similarly high percent solids as seen in CF sputum. Porcine tracheas were excised, cannulated, and mounted in a chamber where the tissues were kept in a warm (37\u00b0C), humidified atmosphere. Known volumes (87.3\u00b13.9 \u00b5l) of mucus, collected the previous day from cannulated tracheas induced to secrete by acetylcholine treatment, were initially placed on the caudal luminal surface of the tracheas and later harvested from the cranial ends at 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr intervals. To minimize mucous liquid secretion by the tracheas during the absorption experiments, these tissues were pretreated with bumetanide and dimethylamiloride, to respectively block transepithelial Cland HCO 3 secretion. Of the total initial mucus volume instilled, we observed that 66.9\u00b14.2%, 62.5\u00b13.8%, and 62.3\u00b16.6% remained after 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr, respectively. The percent solids of the collected mucus (initially 2.0\u00b10.1%) were 3.0\u00b10.3%, 3.5\u00b10.3%, and 4.1\u00b10.3% at 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr, respectively. When the small quantity of basal mucus secretion was accounted for at each time point, the percent solids were 3.0\u00b10.3%, 3.2\u00b10.4%, and 3.5\u00b10.4% at 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr. When comparable instillate volumes (89.9\u00b13.1 \u00b5l) of Krebs solution (which contained no biomolecular solids) were added to the tracheas, we observed that 43.1\u00b10.6%, 32.1\u00b15.5%, and 25.8\u00b15.0% remained after 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr, respectively. The residual Krebs instillate volumes were significantly lower than mucus instillate volumes at 1 hr (P<0.05), 2 hr (P<0.001), and 4 hr (P<0.001). The percent solids in the Krebs instillates (initially 1.3\u00b10.4%) were 2.2\u00b10.1%, 3.9\u00b10.5%, and 5.7\u00b10.5% at 1 hr, 2 hr, and 4 hr, respectively. The percent solids in the Krebs instillates increased during the incubations presumably from mixing with the existing mucus on the airway surface and from the basal mucus secretion. These findings suggest that the presence of biomolecules in airway mucus impedes the absorption of salts and water from the airway lumen. From our data, cessation of liquid volume absorption from native mucus appears to occur at about 4% solids. Thus, in porcine trachea, transepithelial absorption of liquid alone appears to be incapable of generating 10% solids mucus. (Supported by CFFT BALLAR07XX0). CF airways exhibit inflammation and mucus overproduction. Airway inflammation induces endoplasmic reticulum stress mediated by activation of Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1\u03b1 or \u03b2). We have reported that IRE1\u03b1 is functionally relevant for airway epithelial cytokine secretion. In contrast, we have shown that IRE1\u03b2 is expressed in Clara cells and in mucous airway epithelial cells, but not in ciliated or alveolar type II cells, and regulates mucin production during airway inflammation (Martino, M. E. B. et al: Role of the ER stress transducer IRE1 beta in airway inflammation-induced mucin production. Pediatric Pulmonol. Suppl. 32, 259, 2010) . Utilizing Celsius, a gene expression tool (http://genome.ucla.edu/projects/UGET), we found that IRE1\u03b2 gene expression is associated with the expression of mucin genes and genes involved in mucin glycosylation/mucin production. These findings led us to hypothesize that IRE1\u03b2 is required for mucin production by airway mucous cells and regulates the transcription of mucin genes and/or genes involved in mucin glycosylation or mucin production. To test this hypothesis, we performed studies with Calu3 cells, an airway epithelial cell line that expresses mucous cells and secretes mucins. Calu3 cultures exhibiting IRE1\u03b2 knock-down (via pSIREN IRE1\u03b2 shRNA) were used to test the mechanism of IRE1\u03b2-regulated mucin production. In RT-PCR studies, IRE1\u03b2 mRNA was up-regulated by interleukin-13 (IL-13), a response coupled to mucous cell metaplasia. Baseline and IL-13-induced IRE1\u03b2 mRNA levels were knocked-down by ~ 50% in Calu-3 cultures stably expressing IRE1\u03b2 shRNA, an effect coupled with inhibition of IL-13induced mucus cell metaplasia. While IL-13 up-regulated MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA levels, and genes involved in mucin production (SAM pointed domain containing ets transcription factor and anterior gradient homolog 2) in control cultures, this effect was blunted in cultures expressing the IRE1\u03b2 shRNA. Moreover, knock-down of IRE1\u03b2 inhibited baseline and IL-13-stimulated MUC5AC and MUC5B protein production. To evaluate global effects of IRE1\u03b2-regulated gene expression, RNA microarray studies were performed in the two Calu3 cell lines. Knocking down IRE1\u03b2 blunted IL-13-stimulated transcription of mucins and critical enzymes involved in mucin glycosylation (GALNT12, GALNTL2 and GCNT1). These studies also revealed that IRE1\u03b2 is functionally coupled to down-regulation of cell cycle/mitosis genes, energy metabolism genes, and, notably, the CFTR gene. Additional studies showed that over-expression of IRE1\u03b2 facilitates the production of MUC5AC and MUC5B protein in Calu-3 cells. Our findings corroborated the notion that IRE1\u03b2 is a key regulator of mucin production during airway epithelial inflammation, and suggest that IRE1\u03b2 stimulates mucin production, at least in part, via inhibition of cell cycle/mitosis genes involved in cell proliferation and stimulation of cell differentiation towards the mucous cell phenotype. Together with our observations that IRE1\u03b2 is specifically expressed in airway mucous cells, these findings lead to the proposal that IRE1\u03b2 is an ideal candidate for targeted therapy for airway mucin overproduction in CF.

Calcium-activated Clchannels (CaCCs) are widely expressed in epithelial and non-epithelial cell types, where they facilitate epithelial fluid secretion, smooth muscle contraction, neurosensory signaling, and other functions. TMEM16A (alternative name, anoctamin-1, ANO1) was identified as a CaCC, as its heterologous expression in oocytes and mammalian cells produced outwardly rectifying, Ca 2+ -sensitive Clcurrents. TMEM16A is expressed in epithelial cells in salivary gland, airways, intestine and other tissues, as well as in sensory neurons, smooth muscle and various tumors. Though TMEM16A knockout mice die just after birth because of tracheomalacia, electrophysiological measurements in the neonatal knockout mice suggested TMEM16A involvement in chloride secretion in salivary gland and airway epithelia. Evidence has also been reported for TMEM16A involvement in nociception, intestinal and vascular smooth muscle contraction, and bile formation. TMEM16A activators could be useful research tools for pharmacological dissection of TMEM16A function, and as potential drug candidates for treatment of cystic fibrosis, as well as salivary gland dysfunction, dry eye syndrome and other disorders associated with Clchannel dysfunction. Cell-based functional screening of ~110,000 compounds revealed compounds that activated TMEM16A CaCC conductance without increasing cytoplasmic Ca 2+ . By patch-clamp, Eact 'activators' strongly increased Clcurrent at zero Ca 2+ , whereas Fact 'potentiators' were not active at 0 Ca 2+ but reduced the EC50 for activation by Ca 2+ . Of 682 analogs tested, the most potent activator (Eact) and potentiator (Fact) produced large, sustained CaCC Clcurrents with EC50 of 3-6 \u00b5M, and Clconductance comparable to that induced transiently by Ca 2+ -elevating purinergic agonists. Analogs of both activator classes were identified that inhibited TMEM16A Clconductance, support action by direct binding to TMEM16A. Eact strongly increased CaCC conductance in airway submucosal gland epithelial cells, and IL-4-treated bronchial cells, and in human salivary gland epithelial cells. The potential clinical utility of TMEM16A activators was supported by demonstration of increased submucosal gland secretion in human bronchi, salivary gland secretion, and intestinal smooth muscle contraction. TMEM16A activators may thus be useful for drug therapy of cystic fibrosis, dry mouth and slow transit constipation, as well as for pharmacological dissection of TMEM16A function. Background:: Dysfunctional mucociliary clearance (MCC) and inflammation are hallmarks of many airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Enhancing transepithelial Clsecretion in the upper airways by topical administration of Clsecretagogues represents a novel approach to treatment that has not been investigated previously, but could provide advantages over conventional therapies for sinus disease. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, is found in vegetables and fruits and has well-known anti-inflammatory properties attributable to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB. Agents with an excellent safety profile that inhibit inflammation and promote epithelial Clsecretion could be of benefit to individuals suffering from mucus-obstructive airway diseases, including CRS. The objectives of the present study were to investigate whether resveratrol promotes transepithelial Cltransport and inhibits KC/IL-8 secretion in sinonasal epithelium. Primary murine nasal septal epithelial (MNSE) [wild type (wt) and transgenic CFTR -/-] and human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) cultures were used to investigate a mechanistic rationale for an intervention of this type. Cultures were subjected to transepithelial ion transport measurements using pharmacologic manipulation in Ussing chambers. CFTR R-domain phosphorylation and cAMP levels were examined as a test of PKA-dependent activation. In vitro LPS-induced KC/IL-8 secretion was quantified and compared to a panel of intranasal steroids. Clsecretion was also measured in murine models in vivo by nasal potential difference (NPD).",

TRANSEPITHELIAL ION TRANSPORT THROUGH  CFTR AND TMEM16A IS SUPPRESSED IN HYPOXIC  SINONASAL Introduction: Normal respiratory epithelial mucociliary clearance (MCC) is dependent upon the biological properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL) and transport of ions, such as Cl -. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) represents a predominant Cltransport conduit within respiratory epithelial cells. Secondary Cltransport pathways through calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) also contribute to airway surface liquid homeostasis and provide a potential mechanism to circumvent CF-related airway defects in mucus clearance. Sinus ostia closure from edema is thought to lead to hypoxia and a resultant propagation of sinusitis due to the development of mucus stasis and anaerobic infection. Hypoxic surface airway epithelium has been shown previously to develop acquired defects in CFTR-mediated anion transport, but a link to persistent, defective mucociliary clearance in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has yet to be elucidated. In the present experiments, primary murine nasal septal epithelial (MNSE) -wild type (wt) and transgenic CFTR -/and human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) cultures were incubated under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen, 5% CO 2 ). Cultures were mounted in Ussing chambers for ion transport measurements. ASL depth was monitored using confocal laser scanning microscopy. CFTR and TMEM16A expression were measured using quantitative RT-PCR. Protein expression and apical localization of TMEM16A protein was confirmed with immunoblot and immunofluorescence, respectively.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Sinonasal epithelial CFTR and TMEM16A-mediated Cltransport, mRNA expression, and ASL were strongly decreased in an oxygen restricted environment. These findings indicate persistent hypoxia may lead to acquired defects in Cltransport and have broad implications for rescue strategies aimed at restoring CFTR and TMEM16A in both CF-and non-CF related CRS. The coordinated activity of protein kinases and phosphatases controls the phosphorylation state of CFTR and may play an important part in its physiological regulation. However, the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in CFTR function remains unclear as both genistein and sodium orthovanadate (tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors, respectively) are reported to increase CFTR function. The current study investigates the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in CFTR function through the use of the cell-permeable tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Na 3 VO 4 ). Based on previous work using expression systems, it is hypothesised that Na 3 VO 4 [i.e. increased tyrosine phosphorylation] will increase the activity of CFTR, resulting in an increase in the CFTR inh172 -sensitive outward and inward conductances (G out and G in respectively), measured using the whole cell patch clamp technique. However, pre-incubating cells in 10mM Na 3 VO 4 prior to stimulation with 10\u00b5M forskolin/100\u00b5M IBMX resulted in a significant decrease in G out from 796 \u00b1 154 \u00b5S/cm 2 to 220 \u00b1 76 \u00b5S/cm 2 (P<0.005 unpaired t-test) and G in from 658 \u00b1 127 \u00b5S/cm 2 to 200 \u00b1 71 \u00b5S/cm 2 (P<0.005 unpaired t-test). We found 10mM Na 3 VO 4 also acted as a direct, reversible blocker of CFTR when applied directly to the bath solution after cAMP stimulation, causing a similar and significant decrease in G out and G in . The pre-incubation experiments were repeated at 1mM Na 3 VO 4 with no effect, suggesting that there may be a dose-dependent effect of Na 3 VO 4 on the function of CFTR. So far, these data suggest that, in 16HBE14o-cells, 10mM Na 3 VO 4 has an inhibitory effect on CFTR, potentially by maintaining the phosphorylation of CFTR itself or an associated regulatory protein.",

Elevated Orai1 expression has also been implicated in the proliferation of smooth muscle and endothelial cells (Abdullaev et al., Circ Res.103:1289 -1299 , 2008 , and increased proliferation has been demonstrated in CF airways and the gastrointestinal tract of CF mice. Although mechanisms remain uncertain, the increased proliferation of CF cells is proposed to be a secondary consequence of inflammation, perhaps mediated by upregulation of EGFR signalling in basal cells. Increased proliferation could exacerbate CF symptoms, but it may also play a beneficial role during epithelial repair, therefore we examined the possible role of Orai1-mediated Ca 2+ influx in CF airway epithelial cell proliferation in vitro.",

A prominent feature of cultured cystic fibrosis (CF) cells is perinuclear cholesterol accumulation. It is altered as a consequence of the loss of CFTR function, but exact mechanisms linking this accumulation to CFTR function are unknown. The hypothesis of this study is that loss of CFTR function alters microtubule (MT) structure impeding endosomal trafficking. Acute treatment of wt epithelial (9/HTEo-) cells with the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172, results in a shortening of MTs as determined by immunofluorescent staining of alpha-tubulin. Dose and time curves reveal that 6 h exposure to 10 \u00b5M CFTRinh172 results in maximized MT effects that are stable through 24 h. Re-elongation occurs by 48 h posttreatment. Treatment of CF-model cells with CFTRInh172 has no effect on MT structure, supporting the hypothesis that acute inhibition of CFTR function has a direct impact on microtubules. To examine MTs in response to chronic loss of CFTR function, two cultured cell lines (IB3 and 9/HTEo-pCEPR) were examined for MT stability by assessing the level of MT acetylation. Immunofluorescent staining of both cell lines exhibit distinct reductions in MT acetylation with distribution in CF cells being centered near the nucleus in comparison to respective controls. To quantify alpha-tubulin acetylation and to provide an in vivo correlation to cultured cell studies, Western blot analysis of acetylated-alpha-tubulin was performed. Both IB3 cells and mouse nasal epithelium exhibit at least a two-fold decrease relative to controls. These data suggest that a loss of CFTR function has acute impact on MT structure, which has a chronic influence on MT stability markers. To address whether reduced MT acetylation has an impact on CF phenotypes, cholesterol accumulation and related signaling protein profiles were examined in response to the treatment of CF cells with the HDAC6 inhibitor, tubacin (10 \u00b5M). HDAC6 is a histone deacetylase family member that specifically deacetylates alpha-tubulin. HDAC6 inhibition results in restored distribution of acetylated MTs and increased acetylated-alpha-tubulin in CF model cells. CF cells treated with tubacin exhibit reduced cholesterol accumulation with a normalized distribution pattern. Increased expression of the signaling proteins RhoA and STAT1, characteristic of CF cells that we previously demonstrated, are related to cholesterol processing changes also exhibit wt levels of expression in response to HDAC6 inhibition. Restoration of wt profiles of RhoA and STAT1 expression levels offer further evidence that cholesterol processing is being restored in CF cells in response to tubacin. Reduced MT acetylation can reduce kinesin binding leading to a potential bias towards dynein-mediated retrograde transport. To begin testing this hypothesis, the effect of dynein inhibition with EHNA on cholesterol accumulation in CF cells was examined. EHNA alleviates cholesterol accumulation in a time and dose dependent manner. It is concluded from these studies that loss of CFTR function reduces MT stability, leading to reduced endosomal trafficking and increased cholesterol accumulation, which initiates downstream signaling events.",

This suggests a reduction in the release of Ca ++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to a decrease in force.

Morphological analysis showed that the reduction in ASM contractility is not due to a reduction in smooth muscle area, but is a consequence of altered ASM function. (CF) . One of these, VX-770, is now in Phase III clinical testing, and increases channel open probability (Po) in both G551D and wild type CFTR, resulting in enhanced anion transport.

Little information is available regarding the properties of CFTR modulators and their effects on ciliary beating, including ciliary beat frequency (CBF).

In the present experiments, we used a primary respiratory cell culture model of human sinonasal epithelium (HSNE) to compare stimulation of CFTRmediated Clconductance and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) by the potentiators VX-770, VRT-532, and UC CF -152.",

Introduction: Airborne pollutants are a considerable health concern and can worsen respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). We have previously described new synchrotron imaging techniques for examining the mucociliary transit (MCT) behavior of solid particulates in the nasal airways and trachea of anaesthetised mice. Our previous studies delivered particulates in a fluid bolus, however the presence of the carrier fluid perturbed the airway surface and would have altered both the manner of deposition and post-deposition MCT behaviour that we sought to measure. The aim of this study was to verify that synchrotron phase contrast X-ray imaging (PCXI) can be used to detect, monitor and compare the deposition and MCT behaviour of pollutant and marker particles after dry deposition into the trachea of live mice.",

DUOX1 is an NADPH oxidase expressed apically in airway epithelial cells. DUOX generates intracellular protons, which are secreted into the airway surface liquid along a pH gradient that is thought to be maintained in vivo by bicarbonate secretion through CFTR. This study describes the effects of Ca 2+ agonists on DUOX function measured by intracellular acid production. We performed experiments on JME nasal surface cells loaded with the pH-reporter dye BCECF and examined by fluorescent microscopy. Experiments were done in nominally bicarbonate-free, HEPES-buffered solutions. A 3 to 5 point calibration was used to determine the pH and the intracellular acid production was calculated using the buffer capacity of JME cells. Baseline pH was 7.34 +/-0.08 (n = 23) in JME cells. The addition of 500 \u00b5M amiloride acidified pH i based on a cellular acid concentration increase of 91.5 nM. When 100 \u00b5M ATP or 200 nM ionomycin were added in the presence of amiloride to stimulate DUOX-dependent proton release, JME cells generated an additional 220 nM or 76 nM acid increase respectively. In the presence of 2 \u00b5M DPI (a DUOX inhibitor), JME cells generated significantly less protons. In separate experiments, JME cells loaded with the Ca 2+ reporter dye fura-2 exhibited [Ca 2+ ] i spikes averaging 600 nM and 300 nM over baseline intracellular levels when stimulated with ATP or ionomycin respectively. These data indicate that JME cells produce substantial intracellular acid when stimulated with Ca 2+ agonists. Approximately 80% of this acid is produced by a Ca 2+ -dependent DUOX mechanism.

In primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells from CF patients and control individuals, TMEM16A protein was instead expressed at very low levels.

NBC mediates basolateral HCO 3 entry and carbonic anhydrase contributes significantly to the intracellular accumulation of HCO 3 -. Although HCO 3 is essential for fluid secretion, most intracellular HCO 3 that is accumulated by NBC and synthesis is recycled to the basolateral side in exchange for extracellular Cl -, and fluid transport depends on J netCl-rather than J netHCO3-. Na + ,K + ,2Clcotransporter contributes a small fraction of the Clloading in this preparation, which may be secondary to cell shrinkage. Finally, HCO 3 secretion persists in Cl --free solution and is sensitive to CFTR blockers, therefore apical HCO 3 exit is mediated by CFTR channels, not anion exchangers. Supported by Cystic Fibrosis Canada. Mechanical stimulation has long been known to play a significant role in lung physiology, beginning with alveolar type II cell surfactant release. In part, the effects in both alveoli and the airways have been attributed to a mechanically sensitive release of ATP and subsequent stimulation of P2Y2 receptors (P2Y2-R). Though mucin secretion has been suspected for being mechanically sensitive for nearly as long (e.g., Am J Physiol 284: L945-954, 2003; Respir Physiol Neurobiol. 163:208-213, 2008) , there has been no formal investigation of the phenomenon. Using HBE cell culture and perfused mouse trachea models, we have tested whether mucin secretion is mechanically sensitive, and have investigated its possible mechanism. In HBE cells subjected to a series of carefully applied luminal washes to removed accumulated mucus, the rate of mucin release during a subsequent incubation in the absence of exogenous agonist was dependent on the length of the incubation. That is, a short incubation yielded a much higher rate of mucin release than a long one, suggesting that the stress of the preceding luminal wash procedure stimulated mucin secretion. Further results revealed that mucin secretion declines exponentially after the luminal wash procedure, reaching static levels with a significantly low rate in 8 hours. Similarly, the rate of mucin release from mouse tracheas in the absence of exogenous agonist was higher in those that were perfused continuously, relatively to tracheas in which perfusion was stopped for a period, then restarted to wash out the secreted mucins. More interesting, in preliminary experiments this perfusion-induced mucin secretion was not diminished when using tracheas dissected from P2Y2-R knockout mice, suggesting that the mechanical sensitivity is not dependent on ATP secretion. The tracheas from OVA sensitized and challenged mice, which contain more mucin material, demonstrate higher rates of both baseline and mechanically-stimulated mucin secretion. Interestingly, basal mucin release under two different flow rates (10\u00b5l/min vs. 35\u00b5l/min) were similar, suggesting that mechanical sensitive mucin secretion has a threshold. Munc13-2, an important exocytotic protein regulating baseline mucin secretion, is not involved in mechanically-stimulated mucin secretion. In conclusion, mechanical stimulation induces mucin secretion from both mouse and human airway epithelium. This sensitivity likely plays an important physiological role in stimulating mucin secretion in the mechanically dynamic lung, both under 'basal' conditions and during work or exercise. The strength of basal mucin secretion appears to correlate with the amount of mucins stored in the airway epithelium, and mucin release may have a threshold. Finally, our results indicate that pathways regulating mucin release in response to mechanical stimulation may differ from known regulatory pathways, since two major mucin secretion mediators, P2Y2-R and Munc13-2, do not appear to be involved. These studies were supported by grants from the NIH (HL063756) and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic lung disease that is characterized by increased neutrophil elastase (NE) in the airways and lungs. We have previously reported that NE treatment increased expression of p27, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, and cell cycle arrest. Importantly, cell cycle arrest can lead to senescence, a complete loss of replicative capacity.",

Support: NIH, Alpha-1 Foundation, Duke School of Medicine. The thin liquid layer lining the alveolar space is essential for maintaining efficient gas exchange, surfactant homeostasis, and defense against inhaled toxins/pathogens. Airway epithelial cells actively secrete or absorb ions in response to local stimuli to coordinately regulate the liquid layer lining airway surfaces. However, it remains unclear whether the alveolar epithelium exhibits similar purinergic-mediated regulation of the alveolar surface liquid (AvSL) layer, and if so, what is the mechanism(s) of regulation. Since it has been difficult to achieve a unified understanding of the surface liquid physiology within the intact alveolus, in vitro studies were performed using primary human alveolar type II (AT2) cells. In marked contrast to primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, \u03b2-agonists coordinately activate ENaC and CFTR in AT2 cells. This observation may suggest that these two channels reside in \"separate\" compartments at the surface and do not interact with each other as proposed for HBE cells. Preliminary immunoprecipitation data may suggest that CFTR and ENaC are not in the same \"IP-able\" compartment. Studies in other cell types have suggested P2YR/Gq/11 regulation of CFTR via PKC, activation of Ca +2sensitive adenylate cyclase cAMP, or PG synthase-PIP2/E2 autocrine stimulation of CFTR. In our studies, we demonstrate that UTP/ATP raises cAMP by a Ca +2 -dependent adenylate cyclase signaling pathway in human AT2 cells. The increase in cAMP activates CFTR-mediated Clcurrent that reflects both activation of P0, as well as an increase in apical membrane CFTR channel number (N). On the other hand, few studies have tried to partition P2YR regulation of ENaC into effects on P0 or N with no such data reported in AT2 cells. We observe P2YR/Gq/11 signaling through PLC\u03b2/PKC to inhibit ENaC in AT2 cells. Furthermore, our preliminary patch and bioelectric data suggest Na + currents may be regulated by both P0 and N-dependent mechanisms. Therefore, our data demonstrates that UTP/ATP inhibition of ENaC is: 1) a relatively slow process [t 1/2 = 1-2 min]; 2) is equally effective with apical or basolateral administration; and 3) is BAPTA-and PKC inhibitor-sensitive. Understanding how this complex interaction of the purinergic signaling pathway and ion/liquid transport are integrated to maintain the delicate thin AvSL layer may aid in the design of more effective therapies to treat certain alveolar diseases.",

            "text": "Huang, J. 1 ; Shan, J. 1 ; Alper, S.L. 2 The anion exchanger type 2 (AE2) carries out Na + -independent Cl -/HCO 3 exchange in non-epithelial cells and at the basolateral membrane of many epithelia, however its role in transport across airway epithelial cells is poorly understood. We have identified the splice variants AE2a and AE2b2 in the Calu-3 cell line, a commonly used model for human airway submucosal gland serous cells. To assess their physiological role, we targeted both variants using lentivirus-mediated RNA interference to generate a stable AE2 knock-down Calu-3 cell line (AE2-KD). AE2 mRNA expression was reduced by 87% according to real-time PCR (n=6), and Western blots revealed ~89% reduction in AE2 protein expression. Stimulation of fluid secretion by cpt-cAMP (200 \u00b5moles/L) and forskolin (10 \u00b5moles/L) was reduced by 60% in AE2-KD cell monolayers when compared with control monolayers (AE2-KD: 36.6\u00b10.6 \u00b5L/72h vs Control: 95.8\u00b15.3 \u00b5L/72h, n=6, p< 0.0001). Residual secretion by AE2-KD cells was 4-fold more sensitive to basolateral bumetanide (AE2-KD: ~39% inhibition, Control: 10% inhibition; n=6), suggesting a larger fraction of the basolateral Clentry was mediated by the Na + -K + -2Clcotransporter NKCC1. Forskolin stimulated transepithelial currents calculated under open circuit conditions were also attenuated in AE2-KD cells (1.15\u00b10.27 \u00b5Eq cm -2 h -1 vs 2.18\u00b10.19 \u00b5Eq cm -2 h -1 , n=3, p<0.0001). pH-stat measurements of basolateral HCO 3 flux in the absorptive direction (produced by imposing an apical-to-basolateral HCO 3 gradient and permeabilizing the apical membrane with 360\u00b5g/mL nystatin) indicated that basolateral Cl -/HCO 3 exchange in AE2-KD cells was negligible (0.01\u00b10.01 \u00b5Eq cm -2 h -1 ) compared to control Calu-3 cells (0.48\u00b10.08 \u00b5Eq cm -2 h -1 , n=3, p<0.0001). Thus AE2 appears to be the predominant anion exchanger mediating basolateral HCO 3 flux in these cells. Finally, suppressing AE2 levels increased the level of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein by 70% without altering expression of NKCC1 or the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBC1 (n=3), perhaps in response to alterations in intracellular pH. These results demonstrate that AE2 mediated Cl -/HCO 3 exchange contributes to basolateral Clentry and plays an important role in anion and fluid secretion by Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. Utilizing an in vitro model consisting of mucosal exposure of primary cultures of well-differentiated human bronchial epithelia (HBE) to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from CF airways, we have shown that SMM induces inflammation coupled to up-regulation of mucin gene and intracellular protein expression (Ribeiro et al, PLoS ONE; 4(6):e5806, 2009 ). The present study was performed to characterize the effects of SMM on HBE gene expression and production/secretion of MUC5AC and MUC5B protein. HBE exposure to SMM for 48 hr resulted in an up-regulation of MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA levels in a dosedependent manner (1:0 > 1:3 > 1:10 > 1:30 > 1:100 SMM dilution) vs. control (PBS-exposed) HBE (n=4-5). Time course studies utilizing Western blots from agarose gels with whole cell extracts revealed that SMM at a 1:10 dilution significantly induced immature MUC5B at 16 hr, indicating an increased MUC5B synthesis. In contrast, SMM significantly increased mature MUC5B at 48 hr. Dose response experiments were next conducted to evaluate the effect of SMM on mucin protein production. Histological evaluation of 48 hr SMM-exposed HBE stained with alcian blue-periodic acid Schiff suggested that SMM increased both intracellular and secreted mucins in a dose dependent manner. Additionally, Western blots illustrated that SMM increased in a dose-dependent way both the immature and mature forms of MUC5AC protein (n=5). In contrast, while a direct correlation was found for the SMM-up-regulated immature form of MUC5B (1:0 > 1:3 > 1:10 SMM dilution), the increase in mature MUC5B was inversely related to the SMM concentration (1:10 > 1:3 > 1:0 SMM dilution). These findings indicated that SMM differentially affects MUC5AC and MUC5B. We next evaluated the effect of SMM on mucin secretion by ELISA utilizing an antibody that recognizes both MUC5AC and MUC5B. Similar to the findings from Western blots for SMM-induced MUC5B, mucin secretion was inversely correlated with the SMM concentration. These data suggested that SMM might play a role in degradation of secreted mucins. In agreement with this notion, 60 min incubation of HBE secreted mucins with SMM resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in mucin content, whereas addition of protease inhibitors to SMM prevented its degrading effect. These novel data 1) illustrate that HBE exposure to SMM provides a relevant model for CF airways disease typified by mucin overproduction and 2) demonstrate that the infectious and inflammatory milieu of CF airways induces an adaptive HBE response consisting of increased mucin production, which should contribute to the mucus obstruction in CF airways. Funded by CFF. Newborn cystic fibrosis (CF) pig airways exhibit a host of abnormalities including reduced tracheal diameter, cartilage ring defects, and abnormal appearing smooth muscle bundles. We hypothesize that the aforementioned abnormalities will affect airway compliance. Additionally, we hypothesize the airway narrowing to extend from the trachea into the airway tree. The objectives of this study were to develop an airway nomenclature to facilitate morphometric comparison across specimens, to quantitate CF and non-CF airway compliance, and to assess the extent of CF airway narrowing. To capitalize upon micro-CT's superior resolving power a single newborn pig lobe was scanned: the tracheal lobe (the porcine equivalent to a human's right upper lobe). Each excised tracheal lobe was cannulated and micro-CT scanned five times, each at a different inflation pressure including 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 cm H 2 O. The airways were segmented with a custom designed, substantially-automated computer algorithm. Quantitative analysis was completed with the Pulmonary Workstation 2 software package. Measurements included airway inner major diameter and inner cross sectional area; both were attained perpendicular to the airway centerline. The CF tracheal lobe's main caudal and cranial bronchi had an inner cross sectional area that was as little as two-thirds of their non-CF counterparts. In conclusion, an airway nomenclature was successfully implemented, and the tracheal lobe airway narrowing was most pronounced in the main bronchi and tapered with additional airway generations. These findings may provide insight into the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. Airway disease and obstruction is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). To better understand the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, a porcine model of CF was recently developed. At birth, CF pigs developed airway structural abnormalities including a narrowed lumen, irregular appearance of cartilage rings and airway smooth muscle (ASM) bundles. The aim of this study was to determine if loss of CFTR affects ASM function in newborn CF pigs. Isometric force studies of contraction and relaxation were performed on tracheal ASM from newborn non-CF and CF pigs. Tissue segments were mounted in an organ perfusion bath/myograph system. Acetylcholine (ACh) and isoproterenol (ISO) were used to induce airway contractile and relaxation responses, respectively. Fifty percent maximal contractile response (EC50) and the half-maximal relaxation values were calculated. We first confirmed that ASM expresses CFTR by using RT-PCR. CFTR mRNA was detected in non-CF ASM, but was absent in CF ASM samples. We next performed isometric force measurements on isolated tracheal rings and found that the maximum isometric force generation in response to ACh was reduced by nearly 50% in specimens from CF compared to non-CF, but similar sensitivity to ACh was observed. A similar response to ISO was observed between the two groups. To exclude the possibility that the irregular cartilage found in the CF pig airway was contributing to the response, ASM bundles were isolated from tracheal rings and ASM strips were subjected to the same experimental protocols. Similar to that in tracheal rings, ACh-induced force generation was significantly reduced in CF ASM samples. However, a greater response to ISO was observed in CF compared to non-CF samples (~100% vs. 125% relaxation in response to ISO). These data suggest that CFTR is important for the normal ASM contractile and relaxation responses. Further, the reduced response to ACh, the enhanced relaxation response to ISO treatment, and the morphological appearance of the CF ASM bundles suggest that the CF ASM might be in a hyper-contracted state. The altered mechanical properties of ASM may have important implications in CF airway disease and contribute to the pathogenesis of the airway structural abnormalities observed in CF.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that CF patients have an increased risk for digestive tract cancers (Neglia et al., N Engl J Med 1995; 332:494-9) , a morbidity that is likely to have greater impact with increasing life expectancy. The cause of increased gastrointestinal cancer risk is likely multifactorial including pancreatic enzyme supplementation, disease stress, immune compromise and malnutrition, thereby complicating etiological studies in CF patients. Studies of Cftr-null mice have also shown increased intestinal epithelial cell proliferation (Gallagher and Gottlieb, Am J Physiol 2001, 281: G681-87) in mice which do not exhibit many confounding factors such as attendant pancreatic insufficiency and therapeutic intervention. However, Cftr-null mice demonstrate reduced motility, bacterial overgrowth with increased gram-negative species, abnormal Toll-like receptor signaling and low-grade inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. We questioned whether the intestinal hyperproliferation in the Cftr-null intestine is dependent on the abnormal endogenous environment or a property of the Cftr-deficient epithelium. Proliferation in the crypt compartment is largely dependent on canonical Wnt signaling, whereby extracellular Wnt signaling results in the accumulation of the transcription co-factor \u03b2-catenin to activate LEF/TCF genes of proliferation, so we first investigated the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin. In freshly isolated intestinal epithelium from WT and Cftr-null mice pairs, Western blot analysis demonstrated significantly increased \u03b2catenin protein in the Cftr-null mice. To determine whether increased \u03b2catenin signaling and epithelial proliferation were evident in the Cftr-null intestine in the absence of inflammation and systemic factors, crypt epithelium from WT and Cftr-null mice was cultured in a 3D gel system that enabled the development of self-organizing organoids which generate nascent crypts (termed 'enteroids'). Proliferation studies using EdU incorporation to identify cells in the S phase of the cell cycle revealed a marginal increase in proliferation in the Cftr-null enteroids relative to WT. However, when growth factors were removed from the medium, the Cftr-null enteroids showed ~50% greater proliferation than WT enteroids. Analysis of \u03b2-catenin showed significantly greater protein expression in the Cftr-null enteroids at a proportion similar to that measured in vivo. Since cell proliferation is facilitated by cell alkalinity and Cftr has demonstrated properties of HCO 3 export from epithelia, we compared intracellular pH (pH i ) between WT and Cftr-null enteroids using the pH-sensitive dye SNARF and confocal microfluorimetry. Cftr-null epithelial cells exhibited a significantly greater pH i (~0.2 pH units) relative to WT cells. We conclude that hyperproliferation in the Cftr-null intestine exists in the absence of the intestinal microenvironment. The findings are consistent with intestinal hyperproliferation as an intrinsic defect in the Cftr-null epithelium resulting from increased Wnt/\u03b2catenin signaling and a cellular alkaline pH.

Background: dF508 CFTR is the most common disease causing mutation in cystic fibrosis and has been extensively characterized in heterologous systems, animal models, and primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Other CFTR mutations, however, that also lead to end stage lung disease are not as well characterized. While genotype is largely responsible for determining the clinical phenotype, we investigated whether HBE cultured from individuals with dF508 and other CFTR genotypes differ in regard to their airway surface liquid (ASL) volume and electrophysiological properties. Given the high volume of lung transplants performed at our institution (>100 annually), we have the unique opportunity to examine the relationship between CFTR genotype and airway epithelial phenotype.",

            "text": "Supported by the NIH, CFF. Introduction: Hypertonic saline (HS), as an inhaled osmolyte, has been shown to improve lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In CF, it has been suggested to reduce entanglements in the mucus gel by reducing cross linking and lowering mucus rigidity. It may also act osmotically by drawing water into the mucous gel and the periciliary layer, counteracting the primary physiological defect in CF, that being dehydration of the airway surface liquid layer. However, the action of HS is short-lived as salt balance across the epithelium is quickly restored after its administration. Lowmolecular weight dextran has also been shown to reduce mucus rigidity in CF sputum and improve clearance of healthy dog mucus. This action is not attributed to mucolysis, but rather to disruption of hydrogen bonding in the mucus gel. An osmotic effect of the dextran in the luminal mucosa could also cause the movement of water from the epithelial cells into the airway. Since dextran, a neutral saccharide, is too large to cross the cell membrane, its action in the airway may be prolonged compared to HS. HS is already being used in the management of CF, but other osmolytes with similar action may augment current treatment regimens. Hypothesis: For use in CF, we have compared the action of HS and high molecular weight dextran on mucus clearance time (MCT), mucus rigidity (Log G*), and cilia height (CH) as an indicator of changes in surface liquid depth under normal and fluid depleted (FD) conditions. Method: Experiments were conducted under normal (N) and FD conditions (created by ion channel blockade with bumetanide and amiloride) on the frog palate airway model. MCT, was the time for carbon particles to be moved 4mm on the palate, tissue for cilia height (CH) immediately following MCT measurement, and mucus for micro-rheology were taken at the end of each experimental period. All treatments were delivered to the palate in a chamber maintained at 100% humidity by constant nebulization of frog Ringers (FR), the drug-delivery vehicle. Results:TABLE.Group 1: 2%Saline, Group 2: 0.4% Dextran. Conclusions: In both Groups, MCT, after ion channel blockade, was dramatically decreased and CH reduced, consistent with a depleted surface liquid layer. With 2% saline, Log G* decreased from normal after blockade and increased after 2% saline, contrary to expectations whereas mucus rigidity was decreased with dextran after treatment. Cilia height was restored after saline and dextran following FD. Dextran was more effective than HS in restoring near normal conditions for mucociliary clearance in these experiments and warrants further investigations.",

Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Hyperactivation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) results in dehydration of airway surfaces. ENaC is known to be stimulated by limited proteolysis of the extracellular domains and this proteolytic cleavage is modulated by intracellular signals and extracellular conditions. Mutations in CFTR result in defective regulation of ENaC and consequent sodium hyperabsorption in human cystic fibrosis airways. ENaC is activated by limited proteolysis of extracellular domains of the \u03b1and \u03b3-subunit. While the sites in \u03b1and \u03b3-ENaC that are susceptible to proteolytic cleavage have been mapped, the accessibility of these sites to proteases is poorly understood. We applied scanning cysteine accessibility mutagenesis (SCAM) to study the exposure of the protease cleavage sites. First, we introduced cysteine residues into specific sites flanking the cleavage sites in \u03b3-ENaC and modified these residues at the surface of intact oocytes, that were also expressing \u03b1and \u03b2-ENaC, with maleimide that was coupled to IR Dyes. Altering positioning of the cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of \u03b3-ENaC resulted in label of either N-or C-terminal fragments at the cell surface. Introduction of a cysteine at residues 132 to 136 of rat \u03b3-ENaC led to labeling of an N-terminal 15 kDa fragment known to be produced by cleavage mediated by endogenous proteases at or near the furin site. Introduction of cysteine at position 142 resulted in labeling of the 70 kDa C-terminal fragment. Besides these fragments, we detected a small proportion of ubiquitinated high molecular weight species of ENaC, but did not detect full length \u03b3-subunits at the cell surface. However, mutation of the furin site or addition of protease inhibitors resulted in labeling of the full length protein.",

UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA Understanding the mechanism of successful mucociliary transport and designing new therapies requires an understanding of the rheology of mucus in terms of its molecular properties. In addition, we need to characterize mucus at the length and time scales appropriate for phenomena such as cilia propulsion and cough clearance. These phenomena occur at shear rates that place mucus into a nonlinear, shear thinning regime. Our driven microbead rheology (DMBR) techniques allow us to apply cilia-like forces to a micronsized bead and measure its displacement through a polymer fluid. Bead motion under the applied force gives us information about its linear and nonlinear properties, both at steady state and as dynamic phenomena. While steady state shear thinning behavior would predict that a bead under high applied forces would experience a lower effective viscosity, we observe an initial stiffening of the polymer fluid before the bead reaches a steady state shear thinning regime. We model this phenomena as a nonlinear dynamic strain-thickening event (DSTE) that occurs experimentally for microspheres driven through mucus and other biopolymer systems and confirm its presence through fluid modeling. We employ a constitutive model that allows us to interpret the rheology in terms of the polymer and solution properties. The rate at which mucus deforms around the microsphere controls the presence or absence of the DSTE, with a higher shear rate predicted to undergo DSTE. Because probe size is inversely related to deformation rate we believe that cilia invoke the DSTE response in mucus propulsion and may be fundamentally important in its successful transport. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal hereditary disease caused by mutations in a single gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Loss of CFTR function in the respiratory tract ultimately leads to reduced mucociliary clearance, chronic airway bacterial colonization, and robust neutrophilic inflammation. Despite the high level of neutrophils in the CF airway, bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa thrive and evade neutrophil-dependent killing. Several pathways have been proposed to account for the survival of Pseudomonas, however the precise mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. One potential explanation is that Pseudomonas synthesize biomolecular factors that can cripple neutrophildependent oxidative pathways of host defense. Previous studies have revealed that Pseudomonas is capable of biosynthesizing cyanide (CN -), and it is thought that this species may be a relevant virulence factor. Recent studies have revealed extremely high levels of CN -(20-150 \u00b5M) in sputum obtained from CF patients, however, the compartmentalization and impact that CNhas on host-defense has remained uncharacterized. Based upon these premises and our preliminary data, we hypothesized that cyanide (CN -) produced by bacteria colonizing the CF airway compromises neutrophildependent host defense pathways by inhibiting myeloperoxidase (MPO). Herein, we demonstrate an optimized method for CNmeasurements in CF sputum, reveal that CNexists in both free and protein-bound forms in CF sputum from adult patients, and establish that CNin CF sputum inhibits MPO. Our studies have revealed that electrode responses in CF sputum overestimate actual CNlevels by as much as 2-fold. To more accurately quantify CNlevels in CF sputum, we have developed a novel method that utilizes excess hydroxocobalamin to sequester CNand unmask non-specific responses of the electrode. Using low molecular weight cut-off filters (3 kD), we have found that a significant quantity of CNin CF sputum is bound to proteins in CF sputum. Our data indicate that heme proteins are major targets of CNin CF sputum and have established, through various approaches, that MPO is the major heme protein responsible for sequestering CNin CF sputum, and that this important host-defense pathway can be inhibited by CN -. Our studies have demonstrated, for the first time, the impact that bacterial cyanogenesis may have on neutrophil oxidative host defense mechanisms. The data indicate that novel strategies aimed at targeting CNsequestration and/or detoxification may be useful for the treatment of CF, and other debilitating lung diseases associated with chronic Pseudomonas infections such as non-CF bronchiectasis.",

CF Pulmonary research and treatment center, UNC Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 3. Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada Limited proteolysis, accomplished by endopeptidases, is a ubiquitous phenomenon underlying the regulation and activation of many enzymes, receptors and other proteins synthesized as inactive precursors. Serine proteases are one of the largest and conserved families of endopeptidases involved in diverse cellular activities including wound healing, blood coagulation and immune responses. Heteromeric \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3-epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) mediating marked increase in Na + absorption in lung epithelia of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, are irreversibly stimulated by type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) and furin-like convertases. Channel activating protease-3 (CAP3) is one of the several TTSPs that potently activate ENaC. Despite identification of protease cleavage sites, the basis for enhanced susceptibility of \u03b1and \u03b3-ENaC to proteases remains elusive. Here, we elucidate the energetic and structural bases for activation of ENaC by CAP3. We find a region near the \u03b3-ENaC furin site that is previously unidentified as a critical cleavage site for CAP3-mediated stimulation. We also report that CAP3 mediates cleavage of ENaC at basic residues downstream of the furin site. Our results indicate that surface proteases alone are sufficient to fully activate uncleaved ENaC, and explain how ENaC in epithelia expressing surface-active proteases can appear refractory to soluble proteases. Our results support a model in which proteases prime ENaC for activation by cleaving at the furin site, and cleavage at downstream sites is accomplished by membrane surface proteases or extracellular soluble proteases. Based on our results, we propose a dynamics-driven \"anglerfish\" mechanism that explains less stringent sequence requirements for substrate recognition and cleavage by CAP3 compared to furin. Chronic bronchitis, defined as airway inflammation associated with muco-obstruction, is a characteristic manifestation of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other serious pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Scnn1b-Tg mice overexpresses the Scnn1b gene (coding for the epithelial Na + channel subunit, \u03b2ENaC) in airway Clara cells, resulting in increased Na + absorption, airway surface liquid depletion, mucus adhesion to airway surfaces, and, finally, airway inflammation. These mice provide an excellent animal model to investigate the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis. The characterization of pathophysiology of lung disease in Scnn1b-Tg mice has revealed increased macrophage number, alterations in macrophage morphology, and persistent neutrophilic and transient eosinophilic infiltrates. Macrophages are thought to play a pivotal role in regulating the initiation, maintenance, and resolution of inflammation. However, the specific role of macrophages in the development of pulmonary disease in the Scnn1b-Tg mice is still unknown. We adopted a genetic approach (cre-lox system) to deplete macrophages in the context of the Scnn1b-Tg mice in order to evaluate the effect on disease development. The approach utilized macrophage-specific LyzM promoter to induce the expression of cre recombinase leading to diphtheria toxin-induced macrophage depletion. Preliminary studies using double reporter mice have shown that the LysM promoter activity is specific to the macrophage populations and that >75% macrophage depletion is achievable. Further, we have generated macrophage-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice. These mice show no observable abnormalities at birth. However, in comparison to control littermates (macrophage-deficient mice without Scnn1b-Tg), macrophage-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice show significant weight loss resulting in poor growth with high degree of mortality in the first 2 weeks of life. Analyses of cells from lung lavage (BALF) samples at birth and at the age of 5-7 days show profound neutrophilic infiltration with occasional giant cells. Microbiological evaluation of BALF shows micro-aerophilic bacterial growth similar to macrophage-sufficient Scnn1b-Tg mice. The small percentage of macrophage-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice that survive past 2 weeks exhibit significantly lower weight gain and persistent neutrophils in BALF.",

Introduction: Mycobacterium abscessus infections are increasingly detected, usually in settings of impaired host defense, including the CF airway. The organism demonstrates ability to survive (and perhaps exploit) the neutrophil-rich environment of the CF airway. Although macrophages are classically described in mycobacterial lesions, several pathologic reviews of tissue infected with rapidly growing mycobacteria suggest that the cellular reaction is often distinct from the granulomatous reaction manifested in mycobacterial infections caused by slow-growing organisms. Rather, a suppurative reaction characterized by polymorphonuclear neutrophils has been described in infections with rapid growers. We hypothesize that the human neutrophil response to M. abscessus infection is dysregulated and is associated with alterations in gene expression in key cell death pathways.",

Despite an intact respiratory burst, there are low rates of mycobacterial killing and necrosis, suggesting that there is altered regulation in the neutrophil response to mycobacteria when compared with S. aureus. Gene expression data reflect the difference in the neutrophil response to M. abscessus infection when compared to S. aureus and control. Introduction: A20 (TNFAIP3) is an endogenous gene, found in constitutively low levels in most tissues and induced in response to bacterial or viral stimuli. A20 acts together with an adaptor protein called TAX1BP1 to inhibit NF-\u03baB signalling by inactivating TRAF6. A20 cannot deubiquitinate and inactivate TRAF6 and cannot inhibit NF-\u03baB activation in the absence of TAX1BP1 (Shembade et al. EMBO J. 2007) . A modeling derived hypothesis suggests that desensitized pathogen recognition is secondary to hyperactive TRAF6 signalling in chronic lung diseases (Zhang et al. PLoS One 2009) . In primary CF nasal epithelial cells (NECs), LPS stimulation provokes a reduction in A20 and TAX1BP1 mRNA expression (Kelly et al. Pediatr Pulmonol 2010; Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2011 ). Here, we assess the role of CFTR in the down-regulation of A20 and TAX1BP1 and determine if these genes are related to lung function (FEV 1 ) and could act as novel predictors of inflammation and disease severity.",

Therefore, A20 and TAX1BP1 expression appears to be inversely proportional to p65 levels. CFTR knockdown in 16HBE41o-cells confirmed a link between A20 and CFTR expression (43% reduction (P<0.001) in basal A20 expression), but basal TAX1BP1 levels were not altered. LPS exposure induced A20 and TAX1BP1 mRNA expression in control NECs, but expression was significantly reduced in CF-NECs (P<0.001). Furthermore, genotype specific differences were observed in the expression of A20 and TAX1BP1 following LPS stimulation. F508del homozygotes showed more pronounced reductions in the expression of both genes which were significantly (P<0.05) lower than in R117H/F508del heterozygotes.

The median FEV 1 (% predicted) for the R117H/F508del heterozygous and F508del homozygous groups was 82.5% and 50.05% respectively.

Prominent bacterial threats to CF patients with disordered inflammation include members of the multi-drug resistant Burkholderia cepacia complex, due to their ability to cause rapid and severe inflammation and a persistently heightened inflammatory state. In particular, the highly transmissible and virulent B. cenocepacia, which prohibits infected CF patients from lung transplantation eligibility, is in need of new therapies due to high antibiotic resistance. Recently, we demonstrated that a murine model of CF had increased IL-1\u03b2 release from macrophages in response to B. cenocepacia infection in comparison to normal controls. We hypothesized that human CF macrophages would have similar exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses to B. cenocepacia, in hopes of obtaining identifiable targets for anti-inflammatory therapies aimed at alleviating symptoms related to infections with Burkholderia species.",

Changes seen in the chromatin-associated proteins IFRD1 and H4cit3 expression within a large subset of airway neutrophils, further suggest that neutrophils go through an active process of chromatin remodeling upon recruitment to CF airways. Taken together, these results support the notion that neutrophils are active, not passive, contributors to the CF airway ecosystem, alongside epithelial cells and bacteria. Results: Using mass-spectrometry to identify nuclear proteins, capable of binding to the NFkB-containing IL8 promoter, we identified TNFAIP3/A20, which limits inflammation by terminating TNF-induced NFkB responses. We also detected the ribonucleoproteins hnRNP-A1 and -A2B1, which are predicted (EBI) to bind to IL8 promoter near the NFkB and OCT1 sites. Gelshift experiments confirm direct occupancy of the IL8promoter by both hnRNPA2B1 and OCT1. These data suggest that hnRN-PA2B1 may interfere with the OCT1-inhibition of AP1/NFkB-activated IL8-transcription. Regarding two hnRNPA1-sites, the upstream hnRNPA1site overlaps with OCT1/AP1-sites. Therefore, hnRNPA1 may mediate opposing AP1 and OCT1 effects on the NFkB-mediated IL8-transcription. The downstream hnRNPA1-site overlaps with a second OCT1-site and an adjacent small nuclear snRNA-activating SNAP-site. These sites are located in the 5'UTR of IL8-001. However, they remain in the promoter of splice variants IL8-002 and IL8-003. OCT1 is known to activate the SNAP, which, subsequently, may upregulate the small non-coding IL8-003 RNA. As a result, by influencing OCT1/SNAP-mediated IL8 transcription, and by differentially binding to the 5'-end of IL8-transcripts, hnRNPA1 may regulate the IL8 splicing and nuclear export. The expected hnRNPA1-silencing of IL8 splicing is consistent with an experimentally determined 10-fold increase of the primary IL8-001 splice variant vs. the alternative IL8-002 splice variant in both CF-and control cells. Transfection with hnRNPA1 promotes baseline IL8 secretion, especially in [mutant-CFTR]IB3-1 with the initially reduced OCT1 and A20 mRNAs. Hence, in the IB3-1 cells, lacking the inhibition of NFkB-mediated IL8-transcription, the hnRNPA1, bound to the 5'-UTR-IL8-001, may preserve the major IL8-001 splice variant and promote its transport. Ultimately, this is expected to increase the secretion of corresponding IL8-peptide. By contrast, in the [WT-CFTR]S9 cells with upregulated SNAPC4 and non-coding IL8-003, alternative transcripts with no hnRNPA1-binding sites in their mRNA (IL8-002) may lack the hnRNPA1-mediated nuclear export. As a result, the translation and, subsequently, secretion of IL8 in S9 cells decrease.",

Activation of TLRs is associated with production of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin and others which are regulated by VitD. Serum from individuals with low VitD has poor cathelicidin induction which can be normalized by correction of serum VitD levels. Children with CF are vulnerable to VitD deficiency from malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins and are at risk for recurrent/chronic respiratory infections. We hypothesized that CF patients with low levels of VitD are at risk for increased respiratory infections, worse severity score, and lower pulmonary function.",

Additional studies are needed to confirm our preliminary observations from this retrospective analysis. Until further literature becomes available, we must strive to maintain normal serum VitD levels in children with CF. The chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by biofilm mode of growth, making the infection tolerant to antibiotics and the host response. Instead, the induced inflammation and adaptive immune response is believed to contribute to the gradual lung tissue damage and loss of lung function in CF patients. However, the induced inflammatory response and lung tissue damage may depend on the distribution of the biofilm infection -whether the infection is located in the upper conductive or in the peripheral respiratory zone.",

In total 175 BALB/c female mice 12 weeks of age were infected with 0.04 mL of 0.7x10 9 CFU/mL. All mice received the same amount of bacteria and alginate, only the size of the beads varied between the two groups. Mice were sacrifized at day 1, day 2/3 or at day 5/6. At day 1, the quantitative bacteriology was significantly higher in the SB group as compared to the LB group (p<0.003) but no significant difference was observed at other time points. For all time points smaller biofilms were identified by alcian blue staining in the SB group (p<0.003). Likewise, the areas of the airways in which biofilms were identified were significantly smaller in the SB group at all time points (p<0.0001).

The present study demonstrated a more effective recognition of infection and a more pronounced host response to infection in the peripheral lung zones, indicating increased lung damage in the respiratory zone. This supports the hypothesis that treatment of the chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection should primarily be directed at the peripheral lung niches by combined IV and inhalation antibiotic treatment. Introduction: A20 is an inducible zinc finger protein responsible for termination of NF-\u03baB signalling in response to bacterial or viral stimuli. A20 inhibits Toll-like Receptor induced NF-\u03baB signalling by inactivating TRAF6, but must form a complex with Ring Finger protein (RNF)11, the E3 ligase Itch and an adaptor protein called TAX1BP1 (Shembade et al. 2009 ). Previously we have shown that following LPS stimulation, NF-kB activation was prolonged in CF cells and that A20 expression fell below basal levels in CF primary nasal epithelial cells (NECs) and CFBE41o-cells, but not in control cells (Kelly et al. 2009 (Kelly et al. , 2010 . In CFBE41o -A20 did not interact with RNF11 or TRAF6, while both interactions were observed in 16HBE41o- (Kelly et al. 2010) . Here, we sought to investigate the underlying mechanism(s) for dysfunctional A20 in CF epithelium.",

These findings were confirmed in primary NECs. Pre-treatment of CFBE41o-cells with PYR-41 or MG-132 had no effect on the expression of A20 following 24h LPS stimulation, suggesting that the reduction in A20 expression in CF does not result from increased ubiquitination or proteasomal degradation. Western blot analysis confirmed a reduction of the ~80kD full length A20 protein in CF cells basally and after stimulation with LPS. Furthermore, an antibody against the C-terminal end (696-790 AA) showed an additional ~50kD band in both cell lines. Overall, CFBE41o-cells showed less A20 (full length and C-terminal) than 16HBE41o-cells, but the 50kD band was more prominent than the 80kD band in CFBE41o-, suggesting increased proteolytic cleavage of A20 in CF epithelium with the potential for therapeutic intervention with anti-proteases. A20 uses C-terminus located zinc finger (ZnF)4, to interact with other complex members and to terminate TRAF6 mediated NF-kB signalling. Reduced A20 and especially the C-terminal end in CF cells may explain the inability of A20 to terminate NF-kB activation in CF epithelial cells.",

            "text": "This work is supported by the CF Trust UK (PJ541 Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have mutations in the chloride transport protein gene CFTR which results in significant pulmonary morbidity and eventual mortality. Although dysfunctional airway clearance, mucous plugging and epithelial chemokine production are major contributors to CF pulmonary disease, the inability of the immune response to efficiently clear bacteria and attenuate the inflammatory response also contributes to CF disease pathophysiology. Mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), which are both anti-inflammatory and anti-bactericidal have the potential to be developed as alternative therapeutic strategy combating the infection and inflammation associated with CF lung disease. In our in vivo studies, CFTR deficient mice (congenic B6.129S6-Cftr tm2Uth ) and C57Bl/6 controls (WT) were chronically infected with 10 5 CFU Pseudomonas aeruginosa impregnated agarose beads followed 24 hours later by retro-orbital infusion of 10 6 hMSCs or vehicle (PBS). Mice were followed for either 3 days or 10 days post-hMSC administration with daily evaluation of clinical scores and weight loss. Cftr tm2Uth animals given Pseudomonas aeruginosa, had greater mortality, lost significant weight and remained sickly (high clinical score) compared to C57Bl/6 mice given the same batch and dosing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=3 different experiments with n=5-8 animals/group). Cftr tm2Uth given 10 6 hMSCs retro-orbitally initially lost weight, but resolved weight issues by day 5, returning to values comparable to WT without infection (n=3 different experiments with n=5-8 animals /group, p<0.05). hMSC treated Cftr tm2Uth mice also had better survival compared to the Cftr tm2Uth infected mice. When the animals were assessed for clinical score, Cftr tm2Uth mice with infection but without hMSCs had significantly more variation in their clinical scores compared to animals receiving the hMSCs, which ultimately improved. When animals were sacrificed and evaluated for gross lung pathology, Cftr tm2Uth animals had greater focal lung consolidation and pathology scores compared to C57Bl/6 controls (p<0.05, n=5), which was resolved by administration of hMSCs. The hMSCs were well-tolerated in the Cftr tm2Uth and WT mice despite the xenographic source. To investigate how the hMSCs impact the murine model of CF lung infection and inflammation, animals were euthanized at 3 days-post-MSC administration followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for total cell counts, differentials and cytokine analysis by Luminex multianalyte assays for MIP-1\u03b1, KC, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. hMSC treatment resulted in decreased KC (p=0.07) and IL-1\u03b2 (p=0.06) and IL-6 (p<0.05). To investigate the effect of hMSCs on bacterial load in vivo, BAL aliquots and whole lung lysates from our in vivo model were cultured on TSA plates for 24 hours. hMSC administration in the Cftr tm2Uth animals significantly decreased BAL (n=3, p<0.05) and whole lung lysate (n=2, p<0.05) Pseudomonas aeruginosa CFUs. These studies implicate the potential utilization of hMSCs in CF lung disease due to both anti-inflammatory and anti-bactericidal properties. This work was funded by the George and Virginia Baldwin Fund, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and NIH: NIDDK 27651. Defects in CFTR result in diminished fluid secretion from submucosal glands (SMG) in the airways. Airway gland secretions (mucus) contains a variety of antimicrobial proteins and anti-proteases that help protect the airways from the environmental pathogens and toxins. It remains unclear if defense proteins are reduced or absent in CF glandular secretions. We took a proteomics approach to identify and quantify proteins from both non-CF (donor and disease control) and CF (disease) human SMG secretions obtained directly from gland orifices after stimulation with carbachol, which produces fluid secretion via pathways that are at least partially CFTR independent. LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic digests obtained from in-gel digestion of human SMG secretions identified various antibacterial and antimicrobial proteins. A total of 56 proteins had decreased levels and 132 proteins had increased levels in CF samples as calculated by the mass spectroscopy (MS) ion intensities. Among the proteins with decreased levels in CF samples compared to matching non-CF controls were lactoferrin, lysozyme and antichymotrypsin. In contrast peroxiredoxin, heat shock proteins, retinal dehydrogenase and cathepsin D were found to be higher in CF samples compared to non-CF controls. These results prompted us to further investigate SMG secretions by quantitative MS. Proteins in human SMG samples were quantified by using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). A single injection of iTRAQ-labeled non-CF and CF sample after 2 hour LC gradient identified most of the proteins previously identified without labeling. Up to 70 iTRAQ labeled proteins were quantified from 3 repeated injections of the same sample. Fifty-eight of them did not differ between non-CF and CF, including Mucin-5B. Six of the quantified proteins were down regulated in the CF sample. The two most statistically significant reductions were in surfactant pulmonary associated protein A2 (SFTPA2) and lysozyme. There was an increase in a total of 8 proteins in CF sample but the increase was not statistically significant. Further analysis will be performed by fractionation of SMG samples before applying to MS to improve protein profiling and hence increase the number of quantified proteins. Our preliminary tests for pre-fractionation on unlabeled samples using a strong cation-exchange chromatography resulted in 3-fold increase in the number of total proteins identified. These results suggest that the protein composition of primary mucus from CF airway glands is altered. However, the present experiments were carried out with mucus obtained from glands in inflamed airways. It will be important to determine if altered protein composition occurs in CF mice, ferrets and pigs prior to the onset of disease.",

In patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension it serves as a useful marker of ventricular dysfunction and correlates well with the severity of haemodynamic impairment. It has been suggested that the measurement of serum BNP in patients with less advanced lung disease could provide a means of screening for the early development of cardiac complications.

Persisting acute inflammation may be due to failure of mechanisms terminating neutrophilic inflammation. Differences in prognosis between childhood inflammatory lung diseases may be related to the ability to resolve inflammation.

            "text": "Conclusions: Changes in AnxA1 and ALXR mRNA may be secondary to chronic bacterial infection and inflammation which overwhelm inflammatory pro-resolution mechanisms, irrespective of the underlying disease. Numbers were too small to correlate with BAL neutrophils. Since there are no differences in levels of AnxA1 and ALXR mRNA between CF and CF NBS patients, a primary CFTR-related mechanism may also be important. However, there was evidence of occult airway infection and inflammation in some CF NBS, which may go against this. An excessive neutrophilic inflammation, mainly orchestrated by the release of IL-8 from bronchial epithelial cells, leads to progressive tissue destruction in the airways of patients affected by CF. The anti-inflammatory drugs presently utilized have several limitations, indicating the need for identifying novel molecular targets, to open the way to more effective antiinflammatory drugs. CF bronchial epithelial cells play a pivotal role in translating the presence of infectious agents into the release of chemokines. However, the transmembrane signal transduction machinery implicated in the recruitment of leukocytes is characterized by redundancy, as inhibition of one of the multiple receptors recognizing bacterial components, of the different kinases, adapters, phospholipases, etc., could be bypassed by alternative signaling pathways. Thus understanding the real relevance of each single component as a therapeutic target is critical. We started addressing this issue by a candidate gene association study of 135 genes of the proinflammatory signal transduction machinery. The top ranking association with the progression of lung disease was found for a nonsynonymous SNP of the phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCB3) gene (Bezzerri et al., 2011) . Studies on the role of PLCB3 were performed in bronchial epithelial cells exposed to P. aeruginosa in vitro. Silencing the expression of PLCB3 reduced significantly the P. aeruginosa-dependent transcription and release of IL-8 in IB3-1 and in polarized CuFi-1 cells. This was associated with a parallel reduction of a) the sustained increase of cytosolic calcium, b) the activation of the classical calcium-dependent protein kinase C isoforms alpha and beta, c) the activation of NF-kB, one of the key nuclear transcription factors involved in IL-8 transcription, that were all induced by P. aeruginosa infection. We found that PLCB3-mediated pathway is dependent on the release of ATP in the extracellular milieu, upon interaction of P. aeruginosa with bronchial epithelial cells. Importantly, we found that the extracellular nucleotides/PLCB3 pathway is not sufficient to activate autonomously the transcription and release of IL-8 but acts by potentiating the Toll-like Receptors' signaling cascade. In this respect, PLCB3 can represent an interesting molecular target to attenuate the excessive recruitment of neutrophils without completely abolishing the inflammatory response.",

Although the significance of A. fumigatus airway colonization is not clear, up to 7-15% of CF patients mount inappropriate Th2-immune responses to A. fumigatus leading to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Whether colonization itself is a cause of dysregulated inflammation, or a result of deteriorated lung function, is controversial. Recent retrospective studies have generated conflicting conclusions regarding the role of fungus in evoking lung dysfunction. However, results of recent animal studies suggest that mutation and/or deletion in CFTR does cause dysregulated inflammatory responses, in part due to aberrant T cell responses. Relatively little is known about the interaction of airway epithelial cells (EC) and A. fumigatus.

IL-1\u03b2 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in CF disease pathogenesis as IL-1\u03b2 is found at high levels in the CF lung and IL-1\u03b2 gene (IL1B) polymorphisms may modulate the severity of CF lung disease. However, the relationship between CFTR-dependent chloride ion homeostasis and IL-1\u03b2 production and its potential as a therapeutic target has yet to be examined. The transcription factor NF\u03baB has emerged as a master regulator of inflammatory cytokine production and the current literature supports a role for NF\u03baB dysregulation in driving an excessive inflammatory response in CFTR-deficient cells. This study will elucidate the relationships between the CFTR, NF\u03baB activation, and the inflammasome in driving IL-1\u03b2 production.",

In both PBMCs and Thp-1 cells, the quantity of IL-1\u03b2 secreted is dependent on the degree of NF\u03baB priming. Prior stimulation with heat-killed P. aeruginosa and subsequent stimulation with live P. aeruginosa considerably increases IL-1\u03b2 production over conditions without prior priming (p < 0.005). Similarly, chemical inhibition of NF\u03baB diminishes IL-1\u03b2 production to background levels (p < 0.005). Finally, treatment of Thp-1 reporter cells with a CFTR inhibitor (CFTRinh-172) does not result in an increase in NF\u03baB activity or IL-8 production but seems to decrease the amount of IL-1\u03b2 secreted.

Neutrophils in cystic fibrosis (CF) are recruited to the site of infection, yet paradoxically fail to eradicate pathogens. Reports indicate that both inflammatory and intrinsic factors contribute to dysregulated neutrophil activity in CF. Current studies focusing on innate differences have illustrated delayed apoptosis, altered gene expression and increased extracellular release of proteases from primary granules. Degranulation of secondary granules is mediated by Rab27a and its effector protein Munc13-4, that regulates SNARE complex formation.

To date there has been little agreement upon the clinical value of measuring serum antibody response against such pathogens. The initial humoral response to bacteria in the lungs is the production of secretory IgA by plasma cells in the pulmonary mucosa, followed if necessary by the systemic release of IgG. Specific antibodies against P. aeruginosa antigens increase when the infection becomes chronic and a poor prognosis has been shown to correlate with a high number of anti-Pseudomonas precipitins. In particular, an increase in IgG titre correlates with a decrease in lung function and longitudinal studies clearly associate the increase in IgG titre with poor clinical condition. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the ratio between IgA and IgG titre is more indicative of prognosis than individual measurements.",

Inflammatory markers such as interleukin 8(IL-8), interleukin 1-\u03b2(IL-1\u03b2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9(MMP-9) have been shown to be increased in patients with CF compared to controls, as have fibrotic markers such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2(TGF-\u03b2). Azithromycin(AZM), a common therapy for patients with CF, has been shown previously by our lab to increase MMP-9 and decrease TGF\u03b2 expression in patients' sputa. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 are both produced by macrophages during an inflammatory response -AZM has been demonstrated to affect macrophage production of inflammatory cytokines, as well as mediators of fibrosis in vitro and in mouse models.

Correlations of IL-1\u03b2 to fibrotic markers could indicate a classic damage and repair cycle in these patients, whereby IL-1\u03b2 is part of an inflammatory response causing damage, and TGF-\u03b2 is upregulated in response to initiate repair mechanisms. Further, the fact that IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 are not correlated, in either AZM or non AZM patients, suggests a more complicated role for IL-1\u03b2 than simple early inflammation. Rationale: Production of antimicrobials by airway epithelial cells and submucosal glands results in concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity in the airway surface liquid (ASL). The airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) pigs have a bacterial killing host defect at birth, before inflammation and infection become evident. The absence of CFTR has been proposed to impair production of airway antimicrobials under basal conditions and following stimulation of submucosal glands. In this study, we hypothesized that production of airway antimicrobials would be impaired in epithelial cells from CF pigs.",

The defect in bacterial eradication in the airways of CF pigs is therefore more likely to be dependent upon another abnormal mechanism. A hallmark of cystic fibrosis is the chronic colonization of the lungs with pathogenic bacteria. The persistent infection and consequent sustained immune and inflammatory responses result in damage to the lung tissue, loss of lung function and contribute to the high mortality of CF. Pathogenic bacteria utilize a variety of systems to adapt to, and remodel, their local environments to establish and maintain colonization of the host. Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes multiple virulence factors that facilitate airway colonization and modulate virulence. Among these, several exoprotreases have been identified in the CF airway, including elastase and alkaline protease. Proteolytic cleavage of ENaC has recently emerged as a model for the regulation of ASL volume. Cleavage of the extracellular domains of ENaC results in the activation of the channel and increased sodium absorption, putatively resulting in decreased ASL volume. Local alterations in secreted fluid and ASL volume may, in turn, facilitate the adherence of pathogens in the lung by decreasing mucocilliary clearance.",

In vitro biochemical studies demonstrate that Ca 2+ and pH regulate protease activity and stability and that the purified protease has significant activity under physiological conditions of airway pH and Ca 2+ . In Ussing chamber experiments, current recordings of CF and non-CF human bronchial epithelial cells demonstrate a significant increase in ENaC (amiloride sensitive) current as a result of protease addition. The magnitude of activation is similar to that elicited by trypsin, though the kinetics of activation are slowed. These data suggest that one mechanism by which alkaline protease contributes to Pseudomonas colonization and virulence may be through the regulation of ENaC. Structural studies suggest that alkaline pro-tease adopts multiple structural conformations as a function of autoproteolysis. The resulting peptides are consistent with fragments identified in CF airway. These proteolytic products display distinct structural and biochemical properties from the full-length protein, producing highly ordered protein oligomers. From these data we present a model for the potential roles of alkaline protease in the colonization of the CF lung wherein multiple structural states of the protein contribute to bacterial adherence and virulence through distinct structural and functional activities.

Medicine, Pulmonology Division, University of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada Introduction: Despite the continuous arrival of massive numbers of neutrophils, patients with cystic fibrosis are unable to avoid bacterial infections in their airways. The neutrophil is a professional phagocyte particularly effective at killing bacteria through oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms. The paucity of systemic bacterial infections in CF suggests that the mucosal environment may be interfering with the neutrophil's bactericidal function. The resistance of Burkholderia cepacia to non-oxidative killing and the increased susceptibility of CF patients to this organism led us to hypothesize that the neutrophil oxidative burst may be defective in the local environment of the CF respiratory mucosa, and that such a defect is linked to secreted mucins.",

Conversely, uncontrolled activation of the channel leads to increased fluid secretion and plays a major role in several diseases and conditions including secretory diarrheas and Polycystic Kidney Disease. Understanding how CFTR activity is regulated in vivo has been limited by the lack of a genetic model. Recently, using forward genetics in zebrafish we identified a mutation in the cse1l gene that leads to the sudden and dramatic expansion of the gut tube. We showed that this phenotype results from a rapid accumulation of fluid in the lumen due to the un-controlled activation of the CFTR channel. Analyses in zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells indicate that Cse1l is a negative regulator of CFTR-dependent fluid secretion. This work prompted us to carry out a new zebrafish forward genetic screen to identify more regulators of CFTR and fluid secretion. We have thus far identified 25 mutations causing excessive fluid accumulation in the gut (12), ear (2) and kidney (11). In addition, we are also using the zebrafish model to study the role of CFTR and fluid secretion in organ development and function.",

            "text": "These approaches provide a new genetic model system for studying the regulation of the CFTR channel and fluid secretion. The polymorphic gel forming mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, play important roles in innate defense of the airways. Their over-secretion and dehydration has been implicated as important in CF, thus, MUC5AC and MUC5B are biologically relevant candidate gene modifiers for CF lung disease. Southern blots, to determine the length of the MUC5AC variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), were used to define the distribution of VNTR allele sizes by severity of lung phenotype, using F508del homozygous Caucasians at UNC/CWRU. MUC5AC VNTR allele lengths were highly polymorphic, ranging in size from 5.6 to 8.5 kb, with a bimodal distribution surrounding 6.3/6.4 kb and 6.9 kb. Although there was no indication that severity of CF lung disease was directly correlated with VNTR allele length, a highly significant association (p=0.0006 after Bonferroni correction) was discovered between the 6.4 kb allele and CF lung disease severity. In order to add relevance to this finding, it is now important to understand the nature of the MUC5AC polymorphisms on the risk and non-risk genotypes carrying the 6.4 kb VNTR allele. Additional SNP genotyping and development of linkage disequilibrium maps are being used to further characterize the genetic architecture. A MUC5B promoter polymorphism has recently been reported to associate with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Seibold et al, NEJM, 364:1503 NEJM, 364: -12, 2011 , and preliminary results show association of this SNP with severity of CF lung disease in UNC/CWRU patients. However, understanding the detailed polymorphic structures of MUC5AC and MUC5B is hampered by the poor mapping of their genomic structures in widely used public databases, as exemplified by the incomplete mRNA sequence from RefSeq and the gapped partial genomic map in hg18 and hg19 assembly from the UCSC genome browser. To obtain a more complete genomic map around the MUC5AC gene, a full coding mRNA sequence was constructed from four partial nucleotide sequences. Search by BLAST from NCBI returned 99 genomic sequences and contigs from shotgun sequencing conducted during the development of human reference genome sequence. This, and other next-generation sequence data, will be used to assemble larger contigs of the MUC5AC gene than are presently available in public databases. The genomic contigs will then be used to retrieve high-coverage, longer paired-end sequencing reads from selected samples of the 1000 Genomes project that utilized the LS454 GS FLX sequencing platform. These longer sequences will be used to further refine the genomic assembly. Alignments of sequence reads from the 1000 Genomes samples to both the genomic contigs and coding mRNA of MUC5AC will help to elucidate the details of polymorphic structure, thus, providing the basis for identifying polymorphisms that are hypothesized to alter function and/or expression. Similar studies will be undertaken for MUC5B. These polymorphisms will then be tested in the larger gene modifier cohort to establish the link between the identified phenotypic association and the functional variants. A recently completed genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified a highly significant genetic signal on chr11p13 associated with CF lung disease severity. The region is intergenic, lying 3' to two genes of potential relevance to CF biology, APIP, a regulator of apoptosis, and EHF, an epithelial-specific transcription factor with very high expression in human tracheal tissue. It is now critical to define the mechanistic link between the genetic variation in this region and the phenotypic lung consequences. Careful evaluation of the region suggests that it is regulatory, e.g., it contains highly significant regions of cross-species conservation, and regions of open chromatin identified by DNase seq and FAIRE, and methylated DNA. Analysis of ENCODE data from airway epithelial cells has also identified regions that suggest cell-type specific regulation of nearby genes. Deep sequencing across the entire region is being conducted to provide a complete picture of the risk and non-risk haplotypes. In other studies, analyses of mRNA expression levels from >750 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from the UNC/Case Western F508del cohort has identified a strong eQTL for APIP, suggesting that polymorphisms in the region are linked to alterations in APIP expression. Because EHF is not expressed in LCLs, it cannot be queried using this approach, but the potential for the polymorphisms to also regulate EHF is very real. Indeed, analysis of mRNA levels by realtime quantitative PCR from ~120 nasal scrape samples from CF GWAS patients demonstrate highly correlated gene expression between EHF and APIP. Additional preliminary analysis of the LCL mRNA expression data found that APIP is differentially expressed in severe versus mild CF patients, with higher levels associated with patients that have more severe lung disease. Because APIP is an \"anti-apoptotic\" protein, our results suggest that reduced levels of apoptosis are associated with increased severity. This concept is in line with the general understanding of apoptotic processes in CF lung diseases. Neutrophils from CF patients have been reported to have reduced apoptosis with reduced clearance and increased inflammation; plus, goblet cell metaplasia/hyperplasia, which is a consistent feature in the CF lung, is reported to occur upon inhibition of apoptosis. Since APIP is expressed in both airway epithelium and neutrophils, its potential to play a significant role in the chronic disease burden in the CF lung is high. Interestingly, apoptosis pathways are also significantly over-represented in Gene Set Enrichment analysis of LCL expression data. As this region is dissected, using a variety of in vivo and in vitro models, the mechanistic importance of APIP and other genes in the region will become clear and offer insights for therapeutic targets with a significant effect on CF lung burden.",

Multiple loci contribute to this phenotype suggesting that several genes other than CFTR govern this trait and provide the basis for further investigation. Lack of chloride secretion, by itself, cannot explain the diverse biological manifestations observed in the CF patient. Gene modifiers and environment have been suggested as contributors to CF phenotypic variability. Another possible contributor could be transcriptional dysregulation as a response to CFTR's absence. Homeostatic mechanisms within the cell mobilize the transcriptional machinery to make more CFTR and in the process influence other genes. Furthermore, the complement of genes affected may be cell type specific, as transcriptional networks themselves differ between cell types due to tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs). We devised a strategy to identify elements of the transcriptional regulatory networks altered in CF. The strategy combines transcriptome data generated from specific tissues, with bioinformatics to sift through the transcript data to find common promoter elements in genes showing altered expression. This will be done first tissue-by-tissue and when data from several tissues are available we will look for regulatory elements common to most or all CF cells. Clinical relevance of the identified transcriptional networks will be assessed using the Gene Modifier Study. As a proof of concept, we started with liver as we have functional data from CF mouse liver that can be used to evaluate the physiological significance of our findings.",

Functional analysis indicated that cholesterol biosynthesis was one of the Biological Go Terms over-represented in the differentially expressed genes. All of the cholesterol synthesis related genes present in the chip exhibited significant reduction in mRNA. This message reduction has functional consequences since de novo cholesterol synthesis was also significantly reduced in these mice. Cholesterol fractional synthesis in CF livers was 9.62 \u00b1 0.85 vs. 37.64 \u00b1 4.04 % synthesized/day in WT, p = 0.03 (mean \u00b1 SE, n=4).

This analysis revealed that genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis clustered together in two main groups, and have an over-representation of 6 TFs, one of which V$ZF02, stood out. A member of this family Zfp202 (ZNF202 in humans) is a transcriptional repressor that binds to elements found predominantly in lipid metabolism related genes and a candidate for human dyslipidemia. Therefore, Zfp202 may be a good candidate responsible for the decrease in cholesterol synthesis observed in our CF mice.

Introduction: CF is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and in which lung disease is characterized by chronic infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among CF patients. While the median age of survival among patients with CF is only 38 years, there is a range of disease severity. We used a novel genomics approach to generate genome-wide expression profiles with the purpose of identifying non-invasive gene expression markers for CF severity. Transcription was induced by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with autologous serum (self-baseline control), allogeneic serums (healthy unrelated controls), serum of previously healthy individuals with newly acquired respiratory infections and CF patient serums. We chose this methodology because the serum assay generated a more robust signature than did directly profiling PBMCs, the technique currently used for expression arrays.",

Children with two panel mutations had a remarkably worse clinical outcome. We speculate that as these children are followed, it will become clearer which genotypes are most predictive of disease. These data may modify the definition of positive NBS for CF and thereby increase the positive predictive values of the 4 step model. Rationale: \u03b2-agonist bronchodilators are commonly prescribed in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to improve airway clearance and reduce work of breathing. Previous research has demonstrated significant variability in the airway response to \u03b2-agonists in patients with CF, suggesting a genetic influence in drug response. Genetic variation of the \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) at amino acid 16 is one of the common genetic variants that has been studied previously. Although one report explored the influence of this genetic variation on bronchodilation following inhaled \u03b2-agonist, spirometry was performed only five minutes following administration, which may not have allowed enough time for the drug to take full effect. We sought to determine the influence of genetic variation of ADRB2 on the airway response to albuterol in patients with CF when compared to matched healthy controls at baseline and at 60 minutes following the administration of albuterol (2.5mg diluted in 3ml normal saline).",

Introduction: To test the outcome of CF newborn screening in the Netherlands, a pilot was conducted in 2008 to 2011 in which families could voluntarily participate in CF newborn screening. This inevitably resulted in a group of patients with equivocal diagnosis, like the patients with R117H/F508del mutations. Since all R117H/F508del (7T) patients reported are pancreas sufficient (PS) and mainly CBAVD is seen in combination with the R117H mutation, the question was whether the impaired conductance and Po of R117H CFTR reduces transepithelial chloride transport across distal colon.",

            "text": "Supported by ZonNW. Airway mucus clearance is an essential innate defense mechanism, and its failure is a primary trigger in the development of obstructive lung diseases. Experimentally, a pathologic imbalance in epithelial ion and water transport has been achieved by airway-targeted overexpression of the epithelial Na + channel \u03b2 subunit (\u03b2ENaC, encoded by the Scnn1b gene) in murine lungs, resulting in early onset airway mucus obstruction, inflammation, and air space enlargement. Congenic lines of this model have been generated, revealing a striking effect of genetic background on survival, ranging from 5 to 80% among strains (FVB/NJ < BALB/cJ < C3H/HeN < C57Bl/6N). At least as estimated by histopathological examination, airway mucus obstruction, inflammation and air space enlargement, were present in all Scnn1b-Tg strains, regardless of their survival rates. In mouse strains exhibiting extremely high mortality, selective pressure for survivors is common. We have isolated a substrain of BALB/cJ Scnn1b-Tg mice (Line B), originating from an N9 founder male, and identified as having increased survival (79\u00b15% vs. 26\u00b14% at 20 postnatal days, for BALB/cJ Scnn1b-Tg Line B vs. the original BALB/cJ strain, renamed BALB/cJ Line A, n>58). Scnn1b transgene Southern blot, mRNA and immunohistochemistry analyses reveal that the transgene is present and overexpressed in both Line A and Line B, suggesting that a large rearrangement in the transgene insertion site was not the cause of the phenotypic variation in these lines. However, as measured by Ussing chamber, ENaC hyperactivity was reduced in Scnn1b-Tg Line B vs. Line A in 3 and 10 day-old pups, but fully resumed in 6 week-old mice. As compared to Line A, the absence of early ENaC hyperactivity in Line B correlated with the absence of spotty airway epithelial necrotic degeneration, obvious mucus plugging and airway inflammation in 5 day-old mice (18.7\u00b111 vs. 22.9\u00b115 neutrophils/mL BALF\u00d710 3 , WT vs. Scnn1b-Tg mice, n\u22659), as assessed by morphometry and BAL. Preliminary data indicate that BALB/cJ Line B Scnn1b-Tg pups were also protected from spontaneous bacterial infection, typically associated with inefficient mucus clearance in neonatal Scnn1b-Tg mice. Further analysis revealed that the functional \"reactivation\" of ENaC hyperactivity in adult BALB/cJ Line B Scnn1b-Tg mice was associated with establishment of persistent neutrophilic inflammation (1.3\u00b10.9 vs. 165\u00b123 neutrophils/mL BALF\u00d710 3 , for 4 week-old WT vs. Scnn1b-Tg mice, n\u22656) and airway mucus plugging. However, adult BALB/cJ line B Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited no evidence of air-space enlargement, as assessed by unbiased stereology, for the first time separating the chronic bronchitis phenotype from the alveolar phenotype in the Scnn1b-Tg lines. Collectively, these data suggest that: 1) neonatal lung inflammation/airway surface dehydration contributes to the emphysematous phenotype observed in Scnn1b-Tg mice; and 2) neonatal lesions are not necessary for the development of obstructive lung disease due to airway surface dehydration in this model. We have been investigating yeast Yor1-\u2206F670 as a genetic model for identifying novel factors that contribute to F508del-CFTR biogenesis. A quantitative high throughput cell array phenotyping (Q-HTCP) assay that measures shifts in growth kinetics elicited by inhibitory concentrations of oligomycin (extruded from the cell by Yor1) was used to search for genegene interactions (epistasis factors) that mediate ABC protein folding and maturation. Yor1-\u2206F was introduced into the genomic ordered array of yeast gene deletion strains. Strains that grew more robustly than expected in the presence of oligomycin suggested genes involved in ERAD and other prodegradation pathways, whereas strains that grew less well than matched controls indicated potential pro-Yor1-\u2206F biogenesis factors.",

Additionally, members of the EMC clustered together based on gene-drug interaction profiles that incorporated other classes of perturbation.

Cell Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA Cystic fibrosis is characterized by a loss of CFTR activity which leads to defects in the function of several organs including the lung, intestine, liver, and pancreas. The recent development of pig and ferret CFTR knockout models will greatly improve our understanding of CF pathophysiology; however, defining how CFTR functions during organogenesis requires a more accessible model. To address the role of CFTR during organ development we are using the zebrafish, a model that is genetically tractable, easily manipulated, and optically clear during development. Zebrafish Cftr shares high homology with human CFTR in key channel domains and is responsive to many activators and inhibitors of the human channel. In addition, previous work from our lab has introduced zebrafish forward genetics for the identification of new CFTR regulators. To better understand how CFTR functions during embryonic development and how its loss leads to defects in organ function, we have developed several tools that utilize the strengths of the zebrafish model. Using in situ hybridization, antibody staining, and transgenesis, we have observed that cftr is expressed in the developing gut, liver, and pancreas, similar to what has been reported for human CFTR. We have also developed transgenic zebrafish expressing a halide sensitive YFP to assay Cftr's chloride channel activity in these organs in vivo. To target Cftr channel activity we have used several methods, including antisense morpholinos, short hairpin RNAs, pharmacological inhibitors, and mutants. Loss of Cftr activity leads to early organogenesis defects in the liver and pancreas which are reminiscent of the pathology observed in patients with advanced CF. In addition, we have observed defects in organ laterality and in the embryonic axis which are specific to the zebrafish model. Altogether, our data suggest that the pancreatic and liver defects seen in cystic fibrosis may arise during embryonic development. The accessibility of the zebrafish will help advance our understanding of the role CFTR plays during organogenesis and the pathophysiology of CF. The incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) bone disease is growing as life expectancy continues to increase. Cftr-null mice (Cftr S489X-/-mice, further identified as Cftr-/-) have reduced bone density, despite lack of lung or pancreatic disease, suggesting an inherent defect in bone metabolism. Defects in bone homeostasis in CF individuals and mouse models imply reduced bone formation. To further pursue mechanisms for reduced bone mineral density, we tested effects of CFTR, utilizing ex vivo osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from Cftr-/-and wildtype (Cftr+/+) mice.",

Ex vivo CFTR-deficient osteoblasts exhibit reduced growth rate and osteogenic differentiation. Reductions in cellular proliferation may be related to the increased levels of Osterix and Runx2, which are consistent with a more committed cell, instead of an early progenitor cell. Discordant inductions of osteocalcin and collagen 1a1, in the differentiation and mineralization phases, are consistent with delayed maturation of osteoblasts, noted in the reduced alkaline phosphatase staining. This mechanistic profile lends evidence to findings of reduced bone formation seen in CF bone disease. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a common co-morbidity in cystic fibrosis which worsens prognosis. Pancreatic endocrine disruption and dysregulated insulin responses are features of CFRD. We have developed a CFTR knockout ferret model that demonstrates abnormal glycemia at birth prior to pancreatic destruction. In this study, we focused on defining both the structural and functional characteristics of the newborn CF and non-CF ferret endocrine pancreas at birth, a time point when only minimal histopathology is observed, limited to acinar duct swelling. Structural characterization involved quantitative morphometry of insulin (beta cells) and glucagon (alpha cells) expression by immunohistochemistry, while glucose tolerance tests (GTT) and L-arginine tolerance tests (ATT) were performed to assess endocrine pancreatic function. The percentage of lobular pancreatic area expressing insulin or glucagon, which included the total cellular area of exocrine and endocrine tissue, was not significantly different between CF and non-CF pancreata. However, newborn CF pancreata had fewer large islets (>100\u00b5m in diameter) with significantly more islet cell clusters (<100\u00b5m in diameter) and individual insulin positive cells as compared to non-CF pancreata. Although the number of large islets was significantly decreased in newborn CF pancreata, the average diameter of this population of islets was not significantly different between genotypes. To compare betacell replication, neonatal CF versus non-CF pancreas sections were dual stained with insulin and PCNA to calculate the percent proliferation. This showed no significant difference in beta cell proliferation. The results of these studies demonstrate morphologic differences in size and number of islets in the newborn CF pancreas without significant differences in overall insulin and glucagon expression. By contrast, progressive loss of insulin and glucagon staining was observed as CF animals aged (21-32 days), associated with extensive exocrine pancreas pathology classic for CF. To evaluate whether functional abnormalities in the endocrine pancreas exist prior to overt histopathologic disease, GTT and ATT assays were performed in newborn animals. The CF kits demonstrated significantly elevated peak blood glucose levels during GTT as compared to non-CF kits. This was associated with a 4-fold blunting of first phase insulin secretion in the CF newborns, determined 2 minutes after intraperitoneal arginine administration. By contrast, in CF newborns second phase insulin secretion was elevated 4-fold as determined at 2 hours during the GTT. These findings suggest that early abnormalities in endocrine pancreas function may occur in CF prior to overt exocrine pancreas destruction. Future studies utilizing the CF ferret model should aid in understanding the multiple factors that contribute to the development of CFRD.",

            "text": "In order to better understand cystic fibrosis (CF) disease pathogenesis, a porcine model of CF was recently developed. CF pigs display many of the same features as humans with CF including meconium ileus, exocrine pancreatic destruction, focal biliary cirrhosis, micro-gallbladder, vas deferens abnormalities, and airway disease. In contrast to humans, there is a 100% penetrance of meconium ileus in both CFTR-/-and CFTR\u2206F508/\u2206F508 newborn piglets. Features of the CF pig meconium ileus closely replicate that observed in humans with CF including distal bowel obstruction, atretic intestinal segments, and microcolon. In this study, we hypothesized that transgenic expression of CFTR in the intestinal epithelium of CF pigs would reduce or alleviate the meconium ileus phenotype. We generated CFTR-/pigs expressing CFTR under the control of the rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP) promoter (hereafter called CFTR-/-;TgFABP-pCFTR). Using somatic cell nuclear transfer, five different transgenic CFTR-/-;TgFABP-pCFTR lines were generated. From the lines studied, piglets from 2 lines (1a and 1e) had a favorable intestinal phenotype at birth. In these animals, there was a relatively normal-appearing small intestine, no evidence of atretic intestinal segments, and a normal-sized spiral colon. In contrast, piglets from the other three lines (1b, 1c, 1d) had evidence of severe meconium ileus at birth. Both ileal CFTR mRNA levels and CFTR-mediated Cl\u2212 transport were greater in the intestines of lines 1a and 1e, compared to 1b, 1c, and 1d. In all of the lines studied, we observed a similar degree of pancreatic destruction, micro-gallbladder, and focal biliary cirrhosis compared to CFTR-/-pigs suggesting that the pathogenesis of meconium ileus is not dependent upon abnormal pancreatic or gallbladder function. Importantly, in Ussing chamber studies there was no evidence of CFTR-mediated Cl\u2212 transport in either freshly excised tracheal tissue or cultured tracheal and nasal turbinate epithelial samples. Similar to older CFTR-/-and CFTR\u2206F508/\u2206F508 pigs, the older gut-corrected pigs in this study also developed varying severity of CF-like lung disease. These data demonstrate a successful non-surgical approach to correction of meconium ileus in CF pigs and provide valuable insight into the underlying pathogenesis of meconium ileus in CF. These gut-corrected CF pigs may be a useful model to study CF lung disease pathogenesis over time and the effects of therapeutics. Primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) grown at airliquid interface (ALI), retain many features of the native tissue: a pseudostratified structure composed of basal, ciliated and goblet cells, functional cilia and ion transport capabilities to maintain fluid homeostasis on the airway mucosa. Although an elegant and powerful model system, ALI cultured cells require growth on a permeable support (e.g. Transwell) that is both expensive and limits throughput.

            "text": "The major route for cAMP-mediated chloride (Cl) secretion across the intestinal epithelial apical membrane is presumed to be via the CFTR chloride channel widely known to be activated in vitro by genistein. We have previously shown that a 1-2 week period of daily injections with genistein (600 mg/kg body weight, 600G) mediates significant increases in basal intestinal Cl secretion (Isc, \u00b5A/cm 2 ) in both male and female C57BL/6J wild-type mice, when compared to DMSO control injected mice (0G). This study aimed to determine whether 600G-induced increases in intestinal Cl secretion were attributed to changes in intracellular signaling mechanisms using basolateral application of: MDL-12330A (adenylate cyclase inhibitor, 10 \u00b5M), KT-5720 (PKA inhibitor, 1 \u00b5M), LY-294002 (PI3K inhibitor, 20 \u00b5M) and PD-98059 (MAPK inhibitor, 10 \u00b5M). In female 600G mice, basal intestinal Isc was 215.9\u00b113.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=15), and application of forskolin (10 \u00b5M, bilateral) significantly increased Isc to 316.6\u00b123.4 \u00b5A/cm 2 after 1 week of injections. There was no effect of KT-5720 (n=8), LY-294002 (n=12), or PD-98059 (n=8) on the basal or forskolin-stimulated Isc. Application of MDL-12330A, significantly decreased (n=8, P<0.05) both basal Isc by 27% (from 215.9\u00b113.1 to 157.0\u00b122.9 \u00b5A/cm 2 ) and forskolin-stimulated Isc by 39% (from 316.6\u00b123.4 to 192.6\u00b119.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 ). In male 600G mice, basal intestinal Isc was 186.6\u00b17.6 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=5), and application of forskolin significantly increased Isc to 259.8\u00b117.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 after 2 weeks of injections. There was no effect of KT-5720 (n=7), LY-294002 (n=11), PD-98059 (n=7) or MDL-12330A (n=11), on the basal Isc or forskolin-stimulated Isc. These data suggest that gender differences exist in how genisteinmediated increases in intestinal Isc are mediated: via adenylate cyclase in wild-type female mice but not in male mice. Supported by NIH (1R15DK071625-01A2). Airway mucus hypersecretion, overproduction and obstruction are pathophysiological characteristics of severe lung diseases including CF, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite the enormous impact of these disorders, there is only limited murine model that reproduces the mucous-related airway obstruction. Increasing evidence suggests that these pulmonary phenotypes are due to increased airway Na + absorption mediated by the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na + channel (ENaC), which results in depletion of airway surface liquid (ASL). Interestingly, a recent report showed the mice, which overexpress epithelial Na + channel \u03b2 subunit (\u03b2ENaC) in the lower airway, as a possible murine model of CF lung disease (Mall et al., Nat. Med. 2004 ). However, these mice mostly die within 4 weeks after birth due to severe airway obstruction, which limits potential to further analyze the pulmonary phenotypes of these mice. In the present study, a low-mortality \u03b2ENaC-transgenic (Tg) mouse line was established by crossing commercially available \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and C57/BL6 mice for 3 generations. Consistent with the previous finding, mucus hypersecretory, airway inflammatory and emphysema-like phenotypes were observed in our low-mortality \u03b2ENaC-Tg mouse line by the analysis of fucose concentration and number of immune cells (leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils) in BAL fluid (BALF), number of Alcian blue/PAS positive cells in lung tissue, expression of goblet cells-and mucin-related genes (Clca1, gob5, MUC4, MUC5AC and MUC5B) and inflammatory cytokine genes (KC, TNF\u03b1, IL-2, IL-13) in lung tissue, and alveolar mean linear intercept (MLI). Notably, DNA microarray analysis by the \"3D-Gene\" mouse oligo chip 24k (Toray Industries, Kanagawa, Japan) further confirmed the pulmonary phenotypes observed in our Tg mouse line. Lastly, clinically acceptable respiratory parameters, such as elastance (E), compliance (C = 1/E), hysteresivity (eta; characterizes the ratio of energy dissipation to energy conservation in the lung tissues), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 0.1 second (FEV0.1) and FEV0.1% (FEV0.1/FVC), were analyzed by invasive lung function measurements using the flexiVent (SCIREQ Inc. Montreal, Quebec, Canada), which is known to result in relatively precise and physiological variables. Importantly, airway elastance was decreased and compliance and hysteresivity were increased in the Tg mice compared with their wild-type littermate mice, and FEV0.1/FVC, a marker of airflow obstruction during expiration, was significantly decreased in this Tg line, suggesting the impaired pulmonary mechanics in our established \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice. Taken together, the studies establish a low-mortality \u03b2ENaC-Tg mouse line that stably exhibits mucus hypersecretory, inflammatory and emphysema-like phenotypes, which may be useful for further evaluation of mucous-overproducing lung diseases such as CF and COPD. Airway mucous obstruction and depletion of airway surface liquid (ASL) are the important hallmarks of severe lung diseases including CF, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recently, others and we demonstrated that the mice which overexpress amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel \u03b2 subunit (\u03b2ENaC) in the lower airway, show key abnormalities of CF, including mucus hypersecretory, inflammatory and emphysema-like phenotypes, due to increased airway Na + absorption mediated by the ENaC, which results in depletion of ASL (Mall et al., Nat. Med. 2004; Ono et al., unpublished data) . Although these suggested that the \u03b2ENaC-transgenic (Tg) mice might serve as useful animal models for CF, therapeutic evaluation by drugs that control channel-activating proteases (CAPs), positive regulators of ENaC activation, has not been performed. Here, we evaluated the effect of camostat mesilate (CM), a trypsin-like protease inhibitor that is shown to inhibit ENaC activity in vitro and in vivo on the pulmonary phenotypes in our \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice. Our data demonstrated that oral administration of CM twice daily for up to two weeks in \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice reduced the fucose concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the expression of goblet cells-and mucin-related genes (Clca1, gob5, MUC5AC and MUC5B), but not inflammatory cytokine genes (KC, TNF\u03b1, IL-2, IL-13) in lung tissue, indicating the improvement of mucus hypersecretory phenotypes by CM treatment. Furthermore, oral treatment of CM significantly reduced the alveolar mean linear intercept (MLI), suggesting that CM also improves emphysema-like phenotype. Lastly, invasive lung function measurements using the flexiVent (SCIREQ Inc. Montreal, Quebec, Canada), which is known to result in relatively precise and physiological variables, demonstrated that CM treatment also improves clinically acceptable respiratory parameter FEV0.1% (FEV0.1/FVC; forced expiratory volume in 0.1 second/forced vital capacity), a marker of airflow obstruction during expiration, in our \u03b2ENaC Tg mice. Taken together, the studies demonstrate that CM improves the mucus hypersecretory and emphysemalike phenotypes in the airway-specific \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice, and our data expand the potential usefulness of the \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice for therapeutic evaluation of pulmonary phenotypes of CF. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) affect the functioning of multiple organs in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), but it is the progression of disease in the lungs that is fatal. In the respiratory tract, CFTR is most highly expressed in the submucosal glands (SMG) where it localizes to the apical surface of ductal and serous cells. In addition, CF glandular acinar cells specifically account for the aberrant physiological functioning of ion fluid in CF glands. Since CF mucus has decreased microbicidal activity and glandular cells are the predominant source of innate immune mediators, we hypothesized that expression and secretion of innate immune mediators is altered in CF glandular acinar cells of the respiratory tract. To test the hypothesis, an in vitro three-dimensional acinar model that we had developed with primary human bronchial epithelial cells (Wu X. et al. 2010 ) was extended to three sets of life-extended CF (\u2206F508/\u2206F508) and non-CF human bronchial epithelial cell lines (Fulcher M. et al. 2009 ). The cells were differentiated into glandular acini on a basement membrane matrix. No significant difference was detected (student's ttest) between the average diameters of acini formed by three CF and three non-CF cell lines on day 13, demonstrating reproducibility between cell lines. Fluorescent immunostaining and confocal microscopy demonstrated formation of a polarized mature lumen by day 15 in CF and non-CF acini. Expression of MUC5B mucin (mucous cell marker) and lysozyme (serous cell marker) on day 17 was also demonstrated in non-CF acini, while the ciliated cell marker \u03b2-tubulin IV was not detectable on day 17. The same markers are being used to characterize CF acini. Proteins in basal and apical secretions will be compared between CF and non-CF cohorts using proteomic technologies. Differentially identified proteins will be further analyzed using bioinformatics techniques to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease.",

A major bottleneck in drug development for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) has been the electrophysiological evaluation of compounds in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells. Demonstrating efficacy in CF hBE cells is considered critical in the drug development pathway. Several recent developments in the procurement of CF lung tissue, airway cell harvesting and cell expansion without loss of transport phenotype now allow for the greater use of CF hBE cells. These advancements come largely from CF Foundation initiatives and sponsorship. Here we report the development of an automated electrophysiological workstation to measure transepithelial equivalent currents (Ieq) in primary cultures of CF hBE cells. Until now current measurements have been limited to the Ussing chamber format where both voltage clamp short circuit current (Isc) and current clamp Ieq studies have been in routine use for over 50 years. When utilized properly the Ussing chamber format provides robust reliable results. Unfortunately with the Ussing chamber format the through-put for drug testing can at best be considered modest and then only after significant investment in equipment, technical training and recurring labor costs. To overcome these limitations we have made use of CF hBE cells grown on 24 well Costar filter plates at an air/liquid interface. We designed a 24 channel transepithelial current clamp and a 24 channel electrode manifold to measure transepithelial voltage (Vt) and conductance (Gt) from all 24 filters simultaneously. Ieq was calculated using Ohm's law where Ieq = Vt \u00d7 Gt. Up to six 24 well plates were measured at 2.5 min intervals on a robotic platform. To validate this approach CF hBE cells homozygous for F508del-CFTR were treated for 48 hours with 6 \u00b5M CF-106951 (CFFT panel compound C18) or an equivalent amount of DMSO. Measurements were made in culture media at 36\u00b0C. CF-106951 had no effect on the benzamil-sensitive Ieq. However, as expected for the improved expression of F508del-CFTR, CF-106951 increased the Ieq in response to forskolin and VX770 stimulation and this increase was inhibited by bumetanide and Inh-172. Well-towell and plate-to-plate variations in the responses were remarkably low with coefficients of variation (CV) of less than 10% and Z'-factor values of greater than 0.75. Automated Ieq measurements with this 24 well format can now be used to evaluate up to 500 compounds per week in CF hBE cells further accelerating the discovery of drugs for the treatment of CF.

While cystic fibrosis (CF) produces lesions in multiple organs, the pancreas is prone to disease and has the highest genotype to phenotype relationship. In humans, pancreas lesions begin in fetal life. To study the sequential changes during early disease pathogenesis, we morphometrically studied early fetal development of CF pig pancreas in CF and non-CF pigs. We examined fetal pig pancreas from day 41-82 of gestation (term ~114 days) in CF and non-CF groups. As early as day 41, both CF and non-CF groups had detectable amphiphilic to eosinophilic, slightly fibrillar material within lumens; however, CF pancreata had an increased incidence of this material within lumens compared to non-CF pancreata (P<0.01, unpaired T-test). This increased incidence in CF pancreata remained significant through the time course. By day 54, CF pancreata had detectable increases in mean lumen diameter (P<0.05, unpaired T-test) with rare detection of dilated acini overtly filled with eosinophilic material. Lumen size remained significantly larger in CF acini through the remainder of the time course. CF pancreata had increased lumen to whole acinus ratio, first detected at day 60 (P<0.01, unpaired T-test) and this continued through the remainder of the time course. Our data together with previous work shows that accumulation of luminal material is one of the earliest observed changes in the CF pig pancreas and this begins as early as day 41 of gestation. Furthermore, this early change (at day 41) was not qualitative in nature, but rather a quantitative change detected only through morphometry. Interestingly, the accumulation of luminal material leading to dilated acini at early time points preceded detection of well differentiated acini, goblet cells in ducts or leukocyte infiltration. As has been speculated in humans, this suggests that altered luminal secretions are likely a primary lesion in the pathogenesis of CF pancreas disease. The luminal material leads to obstruction and sequential pathologic changes including secondary inflammation, mucous cell change and duct proliferation. Future studies will work to define the composition of this lumen material as well as the environmental conditions and cellular processing in acini that may further contribute to its formation.",

We were able to grow well-differentiated pseudostratified ciliated airway epithelia from sinus tissue of CFTR -/and WT pigs. Electrophysiology studies confirmed the absence of chloride transport in CFTR -/in sinus cultures. At birth, we also found that CFTR -/pigs had smaller sinuses than litter-matched WT pigs, without any differences seen in skull size. Longitudinally, CFTR -/pigs developed sinus disease evident on radiologic sinus CT scans and by gross necropsy.

Medicine, Saint Louis University, Saint Louis, MO, USA In vitro models play a critical role in both understanding the mechanisms of mucociliary clearance and developing/improving treatments. Postural draining therapy (PDT) is an important treatment in assisting with clearance for cystic fibrosis patients, but existing cell culture models are not capable of measuring mucus clearance as a function of gravity. We present a novel cell culture model capable of measuring mucociliary clearance at a variety of angles, ranging from flat to vertical. In our model we grow primary human bronchial epithelial cells in a bilayer fluidics channel. The separate enclosed compartments allow us to perfuse the system basally while the system is tilted. We have successfully grown well-differentiated, wellciliated cultures and characterized the transport in our system with particle image velocimetry (PIV). By coupling our microscope to a custom-built rotating platform, we gained the ability to rotate the entire optical path of the scope while maintaining the same field of view. This innovation enabled us to perform PIV over a specific region of the culture and then repeat the measurement at varying tilt angles. Additionally, access ports in the apical channel made it possible to not only sample and characterize the endogenous airway surface liquid (ASL), but to entirely replace the ASL with exogenous mucus, or mucus mimics that simulate specific rheological and biochemical properties of mucus. We have measured transport rates as a function of tilt angle and in fluids that range from buffer to pathological mucus, such as the types found in CF and bronchiectasis. Understanding the effects of gravity on mucus clearance gives us insight into the mechanisms and limitations of PDT. Furthermore, our system provides a platform to examine how pharmacological agents modify the efficacy of the treatment.",

Secondary objective: to determine the effect of NAC on neutrophil infiltration, lung function, pulmonary and sinus exacerbations, as measured by: change in sputum neutrophil count, change in IL-8 concentration in sputum and plasma, change in glutathione in whole blood, incidence of pulmonary exacerbations, number of and time to first pulmonary exacerbation, incidence and number of antibiotics for any reason, change in FEV1. PRO were measured by the CFQ-R and CFRD. Safety objectives to evaluate the potential of NAC to promote the development of pulmonary hypertension in subjects with CF were assessed with both clinical and molecular studies performed at 6-week intervals. The panel included level of NAC measured in whole blood, \u03b2FGF and VEGF in plasma and urine, and in a sub-cohort, levels of S-nitrosylated NAC (SNOAC) in whole blood, HIF-1\u03b1 in blood cells, ECHO and DLCO tests were reviewed by the CFF DSMC for safety prior to proceeding to initiation of all other sites.",

Further results will be provided at the time of poster presentation. Supported by the CFF. The nebulisation of multiple doses of a non-viral gene therapy formulation to the lungs of individuals with CF is being considered as a treatment for chronic CF lung disease. The success of such a strategy depends on the selection of a formulation capable of CFTR expression that is high-level, sustained, and can be repeatedly administered. Plasmid pGM169 is free of CG dinucleotides and contains the novel synthetic hCEFI promoter specifically designed for long-term expression of CFTR in the lung; when complexed with cationic liposome GL67A (supplied by Genzyme) CFTR expression lasts for several months in the mouse lung after a single nebulised dose (Hyde et al 2008 Nature Biotech 26:549). A clinical trial to assess the safety and CFTR expression of a single nebulised dose of pGM169/GL67A in 35 CF patients has just been completed (separate abstract). In order to progress into multiple-dose studies a GLP toxicology (separate abstract) and biodistribution study was performed in mice to evaluate the CFTR expression profile of up to 12 doses of pGM169/GL67A. Mice were exposed to aerosolised pGM169/GL67A at 2 weekly intervals for 0.5, 2 or 6 hours (Low, Medium and High dose groups respectively); mice exposed to air for 6 hours were used as controls. Groups of mice (males and females; n=4-10) were sacrificed after one, six and 12 doses and organs (lung, cervical lymphnodes, spleen, gut (proximal ileum), liver, kidney, testes/ovaries, and blood) analysed for the presence of plasmid DNA and/or vector-specific CFTR mRNA using quantitative RT-PCR. A significant dose-response was observed between duration of inhalation and the quantity of plasmid DNA present in the lungs 1 day after delivery of one, six and 12 doses (p<0.0001; Spearman correlation). Plasmid DNA remained detectable in the lungs of animals for up to 21 weeks after the final (High) dose. Levels of plasmid DNA in non-target organs were several orders of magnitude lower than the lungs at day 1. When CFTR mRNA was measured in the lungs, low levels were detected after a single dose in the Low and Medium groups, with increased signal in the High group (p<0.001; equivalent to \u2265100% endogenous levels). Importantly, after 12 doses, a cumulative treatment effect was noted such that high mRNA levels were observed for all animals in all treatment groups. Robust levels of CFTR mRNA remained in the lung for at least 21 weeks after the final exposure. This is the first time that multiple nebulised doses of a lipid-based formulation have been shown to achieve a long-lasting and cumulative CFTR expression that can build with successive doses; importantly this confirms our clinical strategy to deliver multiple doses in order to maximise CFTR expression. In conclusion, these studies further support progression into our planned multi-dose clinical trial designed to generate clinical benefit in CF patients.",

Those at 10 mL were more acceptable, whilst 5 mL produced only small changes. Symptoms are amenable to simple antipyretic treatment and the MDT will use either 5 or 10 mL. Gene expression was confirmed in both the lower and upper airways, and restoration of CFTR function in to the non-CF range has been observed out to 13 weeks following a single dose to the nose. These data, together with our preclinical toxicity packages (see abstracts) support progression of this agent to the multi-dose clinical trial. We hypothesized that ICM performed on human rectal biopsies would quantify CFTR function ex vivo, discriminate between CF and non-CF subjects, detect partial CFTR function, and test CFTR modulators in patientderived tissues. Fifty-seven subjects (45 non-CF controls, 12 CF adults) were enrolled in a prospective trial across three sites. Common voltage clamps, tissue mounts (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA), buffer conditions, and tissue dissection were used. Biopsies were warmed to 37\u00b0C and gassed with 95%O 2 /5%CO 2 in RPMI 1640 media + 25 mM HCO 3 . Tissues were voltage clamped to continuously monitor short circuit current (Isc) and resistance. Tissue was treated with 10 \u00b5M indomethacin (20 min) followed by amiloride (100 \u00b5M, 15 min). CFTR currents were stimulated with 10 \u00b5M forskolin + 100 \u00b5M IBMX (20 minutes), followed by carbachol (100 \u00b5M, serosal) to activate basolateral K + channels and further potentiate CFTR-dependent Isc. Serosal bumetanide (100 \u00b5M) was then added to block Cltransport. The mean (SD) amiloride-sensitive currents in CF and non-CF subjects were -12.5 (34.75) and -21.4 (27.79) (p=0.005). The mean (SD) forskolin/IBMX-stimulated currents in CF and non-CF subjects were -3.6 (11.57) and 99.5 (71.84) (p<0.001). The mean CCh-stimulated currents in CF and non-CF subjects were 6.9 (8.96) and 102.2 (69.21) (p<0.001). The mean forskolin/IBMX + CCh-stimulated currents in CF and non-CF subjects were 3.4 (16.77) and 201.7 (131.98) (p<0.001). The mean bumetanidesensitive currents in CF and non-CF subjects were 9.6 (8.53) and -35.8 (31.35) (p<0.001). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the current changes in response to cAMP/forskolin, CCh, cAMP/forskolin + CCh and bumetanide all had good discrimination between CF and non-CF subjects, with Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) ranging from 0.94 to 0.98. Biopsies from one F508del/F508del demonstrated residual CFTR function (forskolin/IBMX + CCh-stimulated Isc = 31.80 \u00b5A/cm 2 +/-12.27; or 15.8% of normal response). Ex vivo gentamicin treatment (200 \u00b5gm/mL, 18 hours) of rectal biopsies from an E60X/621G-T CF patient was associated with new CFTR-dependent currents. Pre-treatment forskolin/IBMX + CCh-stimulated Clcurrents in biopsies were < 0.20% of wt control Isc. After 18 hours of ex vivo exposure in chambers, control Isc (no gent) was 1.79 \u00b5A/cm 2 (0.25), and Isc in gentamicin-treated biopsies was 12.43 \u00b5A/cm 2 (0.90). These represented 0.89% and 6.21% of wtCFTR Isc, respectively. Ex vivo treatment of biopsies from a F508del/S945L pancreatic sufficient CF subject with Vrt325 + corr4d (10 \u00b5gm/mL each, 18 hours) increased the forskolin/IBMX + CCh-stimulated Isc >6-fold (from 25.66 \u00b5A/cm 2 to 171.53 \u00b5A/cm 2 ). The results indicate that multicenter analysis of ICM segregates CF from non-CF subjects with excellent discrimination, and can detect residual CFTR function in F508/F508 subjects, subjects with partial function mutations, and following ex vivo exposure to CFTR modulators.",

This panel will be used in two recently completed and one ongoing study to assess serum antibody response and to establish a cutpoint for positivity using up to six antigens. Currently, there are limited objective measures available to evaluate lung function in patients with CF with mild lung disease. While spirometry (e.g., FEV 1 ) is the most widely used lung function test, a significant proportion of patients with \"normal\" lung function have lung disease based on other test modalities. Lung clearance index (LCI) derived from inert gas multiple-breath washout (MBW) testing is a technique being evaluated in early lung disease. LCI has detected abnormalities in a high percentage of children with CF with normal spirometry (Aurora et al, Thorax 2007), and the technique has been shown to predict the presence of structural abnormalities, such as bronchiectasis in patients with CF (Gustafsson et al, Thorax 2008). In addition, two interventional studies with hypertonic saline and dornase alfa suggest that LCI can sensitively detect a treatment effect in patients with mild disease (Amin et al, Thorax 2010, Eur Respir J 2011). The current study explores LCI as a potential measure of lung function changes in response to an investigational CFTR modulator, VX-770. This multicenter study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Patients with CF aged 6 years and older with the G551D mutation on at least one CFTR allele are being enrolled at 8 sites in both Europe and North America. Multiple breath washout measurements are performed using 0.2% sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) as a tracer gas and an open circuit Innocor system (Odensa, Denmark) . Measurements performed at the local centers are analyzed centrally using the UK CF Gene Therapy Consortium algorithm by one of the investigators (HS). Subjects are required to have a screening FEV 1 >90% predicted and an LCI >7.4, which is above the 95% confidence interval of healthy individuals. VX-770 150 mg or placebo is administered every 12 hours for two 4-week periods with a 4week washout period in between. To date, 18 subjects have been screened and 10 have been enrolled. The mean age of the subjects was 13.3 years (range: 8-33). Screening FEV 1 values ranged from 91-125% predicted (mean: 97.4%). Of the 10 subjects enrolled, 5 were female. Of the 18 subjects screened, only 3 subjects were not enrolled due to a screening LCI of \u22647.4. An additional 4 subjects were excluded due to an FEV 1 <90% predicted and 1 subject was not enrolled due to a non-CF-related illness on the first day of treatment. Screening LCI values for enrolled patients ranged from 7.8 to 12.89 with a mean of 9.37. Study recruitment is ongoing and expected to be completed at the time of the meeting. These preliminary data support previous single center data that LCI is abnormal in the majority of patients with CF with normal spirometry and support the feasibility of using LCI as a measure of lung function abnormality in a multicenter interventional study. Results from this Phase 2 study will help guide the design of future studies utilizing LCI in infants and children with CF.",

However, FEV 1 has limited applicability in young patients and is not sensitive to early pathological changes in the lung. Hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI provides high spatial and temporal resolution images of lung ventilation in pediatric and adult patients during a single short breath-hold following inhalation of the non-radioactive, inert gas. In contrast to images from healthy controls, images from patients with CF show numerous \"ventilation defects\" -areas of the lung into which inhaled gas does not flow due to airway obstruction. Ventilation defects appear to correlate with disease severity. Clinical studies have demonstrated the safety profile of VX-770, an investigational CFTR potentiator. VX-770 has also previously been shown to improve FEV 1 in patients with CF and the G551D-CFTR mutation. This single-center, Phase 2, single-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the effects of VX-770 on ventilation as revealed by helium-3 MRI in subjects with CF who have the G551D mutation and assess the utility of helium-3 MRI as a biomarker of lung disease in clinical trials. Subjects must have FEV 1 \u226540% predicted to enroll and receive VX-770 150 mg every 12 hours for 4 weeks and matching placebo for a total of 4 weeks. To date, 4 subjects have completed the study. The mean age of the subjects at study entry was 20.3 years. Screening FEV 1 values ranged from 62-100% predicted (mean: 80.0%). Substantial ventilation defects were observed at baseline in all subjects, including those with high FEV 1 . A consistent pattern of change in response to VX-770 was observed in both FEV 1 and helium-3 MRI for 3 of 4 subjects. In the representative subject shown, the response observed by helium-3 MRI appeared to be of greater magnitude than that observable by FEV 1 . Additionally, different spatial patterns of pathology were observed in different subjects. Algorithms for quantification of lung defects detected using helium-3 MRI are being refined through this work. These results suggest that helium-3 MRI may be a sensitive measure of lung dysfunction and therapeutic response in CF and other pulmonary disorders.",

Moreover, using biochemical, physiological and confocal imaging approaches, we found that both Rac1 and RhoA endogenous signalling are required for proper, NHERF-1-mediated CFTR expression at the PM. However, whereas RhoA acts through ROCK kinase to promote stress fibre-mediated recycling of CFTR-containing vesicles to the PM, Rac1 signals enhances Ezrin-mediated anchoring of CFTR to (F)actin and its consequent retention at the PM. Our data also reconcile previous findings that NHERF-1 rescues F508del-CFTR to the cell surface by showing that this effect is abrogated in the absence of active Rac1, thus suggesting a novel overall model for the regulation of CFTR cell surface expression. Most significantly, our data leads to the proposal of a novel ther-apeutic approach for CF, based on the induction of an epithelial morphogenesis factor that activates endogenous Rac1 signalling. We show that the physiological stimulation of the correct signalling cascades is sufficient to increase and stabilize F508del-CFTR at the PM of human airway cells, rescuing CFTR-mediated ion transport to levels comparable to those achieved by wt-NHERF-1 overexpression. Importantly, this physiological stimulator is already in clinical trials for other pathologies.",

The trafficking defect can be rescued by molecules called correctors, that are able, in different cell models, to restore the function of the mutant CFTR protein. However, the efficacy of these compounds, on human bronchial cells derived from CF patients, is reduced. Indeed, it has been shown that activity of \u2206F508-CFTR correctors is largely influenced by cell background.

Tait Proteostasis is the biological folding system responsible for generating and maintaining protein stability and function in the cell. Cystic fibrosis (CF), and other protein misfolding disorders, arise as a result of an imbalance in the capacity of the proteostasis environment (the proteostasis network or PN) to handle the reduced energetic stability of misfolded mutant proteins, an effect detrimental to normal human physiology. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The majority of CF patients have a deletion of phenylalanine 508 (\u2206F508) on at least one allele. This mutation results in disruption of the energetics of the protein fold leading to defective trafficking of CFTR to the plasma membrane and a concomitant loss of cell surface chloride channel activity resulting in dysfunctional cellular ionic homeostasis (Cl -, Na + , HCO 3 -) and airway surface hydration. Restoring the proper folding energetics of \u2206F508 CFTR can be achieved by targeting mutant CFTR itself by a small molecule that binds and stabilizes the protein or by altering the cellular folding environment with proteostasis regulators that manage the folding capacity of the PN.",

Our data serves as a proof of principle that small molecule modulators of the PN can be beneficial in the correction of \u2206F508 CFTR trafficking and function, and likely other misfolding diseases. The F508del mutation impairs CFTR maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane, resulting in a partially functional anion channel which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. We previously developed a robust and sensitive BHK cell-based F508del-CFTR trafficking assay to identify novel families of small molecule correctors. This assay was used to screen diverse compound libraries (total 107,310 compounds), and yielded 185 strong hits (defined as >15% trafficking correction compared to wild type BHK cells). We then implemented validation and optimization steps to evaluate hit compounds from the screens. Here we present studies of a corrector called GSK339A, which was identified using a 3D similarity searching tool (Cresset) based on one of the hits. We compared its efficacy with the known correctors corr4a and VRT325, GSK281 (equivalent to VX-809), and GSK47-1 (similar to VX-809) in-vitro and in-vivo. After 24 h, exposure to GSK339A partially corrected F508del-CFTR processing and increased its surface expression in BHK cells to \u224844% that for wt-CFTR, comparable to the other correctors mentioned above. The rescue of F508del-CFTR-mediated anion transport was confirmed in two cell lines expressing heterologous F508del-CFTR (FRT and CFBE41o-) and in well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) from CF patients. Despite robust correction of the short-circuit current (Isc) response to forskolin and genistein in CFBE cells, GSK339A gave little or no correction in FRT cells or primary cultures of HBE cells from 5 CF patients (Table 1) . To study correction in-vivo, mice homozygous for F508del-CFTR were treated with correctors twice per day for 2 days. GSK339A (10mg/kg) restored salivary secretion rates to \u22486.7% of wild-type littermate controls, comparable to GSK281 (\u22486.4%) and GSK47-1 (\u22485.5%), and this rescue was abrogated in cftr (-/-) null mice. On the other hand, exposing CF mouse ileum ex-vivo to 1-10\u00b5M GSK339A for 4h did not increase the Isc response to forskolin and genistein, although it was partially restored by GSK281 and GSK47-1 (8.6 and 9.6% of wt respectively). These results emphasize intriguing differences between the corrector efficacy in different cell and animal models and suggest that GSK339A requires further medicinal chemistry to exceed the potency of GSK281.

ICM, like NPD, allows measurement of CFTR mediated chloride transport which has the potential for use as a therapeutic endpoint in drug trials. This is of particular importance in evaluating young children who are less likely to tolerate several NPD tests as part of a treatment protocol. Nasal potential difference (NPD) measurement evaluates changes in chloride transport through respiratory epithelia of CF subjects induced by novel treatments. The poor reproducibility hampering the usefulness of the measurement could be improved by measurement over a larger area on a fixed place.",

Macrolide antibiotics prolong survival in patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis, a condition that shares features with cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. It has been considered that immuno-modulatory properties of macrolides could mediate their therapeutic effects. Previous findings from our laboratory are in accord with this notion. For example, we have reported that exposure of primary cultures of well-differentiated human bronchial epithelia (HBE) to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from CF airways up-regulates inflammatory and defense response genes. Utilizing a prophylactic protocol, we showed that pretreatment with the macrolide azithromycin (AZT) prevents the SMM-induced up-regulation of genes relevant to airway inflammation, such as MMP9 and MUC5AC (Ribeiro et al, PLoS ONE; 4(6):e5806, 2009). The present study utilized a therapeutic protocol to further the understanding of anti-inflammatory effects of macrolides on expression of inflammatory genes. We tested whether the novel fluoroketolide, solithromycin (SOLI, CEM-101) modulates the inflammatory responses of HBE exposed to SMM in a similar manner as compared with AZT. In addition, because telithromycin (TELI), a macrolide that is a ketolide, has been shown to inhibit LPS-or Chlamydophila pneumoniaeinduced MUC5AC in airway epithelia, we also compared the effects of TELI with those from SOLI and AZT. HBE were mucosally exposed to 30 \u00b5L SMM for 24 hr, followed by serosal exposure to 5, 15 or 30 \u00b5g/mL SOLI, TELI or AZT in presence of SMM. PBS served as a control for SMM-induced effects. SMM-induced matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) mRNA was inhibited (p<0.05) by all doses of AZT, by 5 and 15 \u00b5g/mL TELI, and slightly inhibited (p=0.07) by 15 \u00b5g/mL SOLI. In contrast, SMM-induced interleukin-8 mRNA was not affected by AZT (in agreement with our published data) or SOLI and only decreased by 20% after 15 \u00b5g/mL TELI. We next evaluated the effect of the macrolides on SMM-upregulated mucin mRNA levels. AZT and SOLI blunted SMM-induced MUC5AC mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the effect of TELI was only significantly inhibitory at 30 \u00b5g/mL. On the other hand, all three macrolides exhibited a dose-dependent significant inhibitory effect on SMM-increased MUC5B mRNA levels. As we have previously shown for AZT, preliminary studies with alcian blue-periodic acid Schiff-stained HBE suggest that the inhibitory effect of the macrolides on SMM-induced mucin genes corresponded to decreases in mucin protein expression. Time courses are being currently performed to further evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of the macrolides. Our findings demonstrate that macrolides inhibit the airway epithelial gene expression of MMP9 and mucins in a model relevant to CF. The inhibitory effect on MUC5AC and MUC5B is a novel finding for SOLI. Because CF airways are characterized by chronic inflammation and overproduction of mucins, these effects are likely relevant to the clinical activity of these compounds. Particularly, understanding the mechanisms behind SOLI-dependent gene expression changes should help direct the use of this drug for therapeutic purposes in CF patients.

Phase 3 studies are underway. Background: Many patients with CF receive potentially nephrotoxic agents as part of their treatment regimen, including antibiotics and high dose ibuprofen. While most centers routinely prescribe systemic and inhaled aminoglycosides (AG) as CF treatment, there has been hesitancy to adopt the use of high dose ibuprofen (IBU). There is evidence that the use of IBU in young patients may slow the decline of lung function over a 4 year period, and that this effect is sustained. Only 3.6% of eligible patients were prescribed this therapy based on 2009 CFF Registry data. Our center has routinely prescribed IBU in our young, healthy patients (46.7% of eligible patients in 2009). Acute and chronic renal injury and gastrointestinal adverse effects are cited as reasons not to prescribe this treatment. Since serum creatinine is a late marker of kidney injury, the use of more sensitive markers of acute kidney injury may be more relevant.",

A single urine specimen was collected in the clinic setting or prior to institution of parenteral antibiotics in the hospital. A total of 52 patients provided samples (mean age 11 years, range 3-24 years). Specimens were analyzed for kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase (NAG) and protein, normalized for urine creatinine. Analyses were performed to examine the association of KIM-1, NAG levels and protein with IBU treatment, IV AGs (0, 1-4 and 5 or > courses), lung function, presence of CF related diabetes and gender. Results: Twenty six patients (50 %) were prescribed IBU. Fourteen (27%) had received no IV AGs, 22 (42%) received 1-4 courses, and 16 (31%) had 5 or more courses. Median lung function was 87% predicted FEV1 in patients old enough to perform spirometry. Six patients had CFRD or impaired glucose tolerance. There were no significant differences for KIM-1 (p=0.34), NAG (p=0.09), and urinary protein levels (p=0.45) between IBU and non-IBU treated groups based on analysis by t-test. KIM-1 and NAG levels were not significantly different for patients treated with 0, 1-4 or more than 5 systemic AG courses, although protein levels were higher in patients never treated with AGs (p=0.04). Comparison of medians (Mann Whitney U test) for all groups did not reveal any differences. Univariate analyses demonstrated increased protein levels for males on IBU, as well as increased NAG levels for all patients on IBU (p= 0.01), but again this effect was pronounced in males. IBU treatment and increasing numbers of IV AG courses were associated with higher NAG levels (p=0.04). Conclusions: There was no significant evidence of acute or chronic renal injury in our patients on IBU. There may be an effect of gender on kidney biomarkers with respect to IBU treatment. Further exploration of the concomitant effect of IBU and IV AGs on acute kidney injury is warranted. Taylor Internal Medicine, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, USA; 2.

Radiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany Background: As a result of improvements in clinical care, survival rates have increased and the rate of decline of lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has slowed substantially. Thus, physiologic measurements (FEV 1 ) are insensitive to clinical changes in small cohorts. Therefore, a major challenge in the evaluation of new therapies in CF is to identify appropriate outcome measures. Although resolution of lung Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is inferior to that of chest Computed Tomography (CT), the lack of ionizing radiation makes MRI appealing as a repeated measure in clinical care and research.",

Collection and analysis of samples for subjects receiving a higher dose of sildenafil with concomitant administration of food and enzymes is ongoing and will be reported. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator molecule (CFTR) and characterized by chronic pulmonary inflammation and infection. Our data on cystic fibrosis mice demonstrate a change of the sphingolipid metabolism in these mice with a massive accumulation of ceramide in the lung, trachea and gut of CF mice. Ceramide mediates increased cell death, release of DNA in bronchi, chronic inflammation and increased infection susceptibility of CF mice to pulmonary P. aeruginosa infections. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ceramide formation employing amitriptyline in lungs of CF mice normalizes all of these pathologies. Amitriptyline inhibits the acid sphingomyelinase and thus, ceramide release. A first clinical study with 4 and a second phase IIa study with 19 CF patients revealed a significant increase of lung function after treatment with amitriptyline for 2 and 4 weeks.",

These data confirm the findings of the previous studies. Altogether, the results from the three studies support the notion of a positive anti-inflammatory effect of amitriptyline therapy in CF patients. These encouraging results will be verified in a larger sample-sized phase III study. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a cAMPstimulated anion channel in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells. The F508del mutation impairs CFTR maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane, resulting in a partially functional anion channel which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. We previously developed a robust and sensitive BHK cell-based F508del-CFTR trafficking assay to identify novel families of small molecule correctors. This assay was used to screen diverse compound libraries (total 107,310 compounds), and yielded 185 strong hits (defined as >15% trafficking correction compared to wild type BHK cells). Amongst the confirmed hits, we recently identified glafenine, an anthranilic acid derivative with analgesic properties as a novel F508del-CFTR corrector and validated its activity in various biological assays(1). Here we present the SAR studies as well as our medicinal chemistry efforts to optimise the ability of glafenine analogues to rescue the F508del-CFTR-mediated anion transport in human airway epithelial cells.",

Chemically, bss is steroid-like and recent in vitro and clinical studies have shown that plants containing such steroids are anti-inflammatory agents, also in respiratory inflammatory pre-clinical models [2] [3] . In the present study bss was tested in the human CF airway epithelial cell line CuFi-1 exposed to PAO1 for 4 h. CuFi-1 cells seeded on semipermeable filters, are capable of forming polarized differentiated epithelia that exhibit transepithelial resistance and maintain the characteristic CF defect of ion transport. CuFi-1 cells were pre-treated for 20 h with 100 nM bss. Total RNA was extracted and quantitative transcription of 92 target genes involved in the first line of response against pathogens and critical in chronic inflammatory diseases of the airways, were quantified by TaqMan Low Density Array. Among the PAO1 induced genes, bss showed an anti-inflammatory acitivity inhibiting the overexpression of IL-8, GROalpha and GRO-beta genes. No changes in cell proliferation have been observed with high concentration of bss (up to 150 mM). To exclude that the inhibition of the P.aeruginosa-dependent induction of the three genes was due to an indirect anti-bacterial effect on P.aeruginosa, we performed an anti-bacterial array following the procedure for the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration. In conclusion, we have explored the anti-inflammatory effect of bss in a model of CF cell lines finding that bss is able to inhibit selectively the expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokines IL-8, GRO-alpha and GRO-beta. Recent mounting evidence suggesting that bss acts as antiinflammatory molecule warrants further mechanistic studies to determine the full extent of its action. Introduction: Biomarkers are mainly used in Phase I or II clinical trials and are useful for gaining information on mechanism of action and for identifying treatment responders. Current Phase III trials in CF that are using biomarkers as endpoints include VX-770 and Ataluren, which are using nasal potential difference (NPD) and sweat chloride concentration. These new therapies that address the basic defect may be most suitable for people with early or mild lung disease. Traditional endpoints are not always feasible in young children, require larger sample sizes and extended observation periods. When the small size of the population of people with CF is considered it is apparent that alternatives are required.",

The safety profile was similar across the groups, though with slightly more mannitol related cough and hemoptysis reported in adults. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are characterised by bacterial overproduction of alginate or extracellular polysaccharide (EPS). OligoG is a defined alginate oligomer comprised of blocks of \u03b1-L-guluronic acid which disrupts the EPS of bacterial biofilms and potentiates antibiotic treatment in vitro; being proven safe in preclinical animal and phase I human-volunteer studies (1). In potential application for the treatment of CF patients with OligoG, we characterised the ability of OligoG to modulate the viscoelastic and rheological properties of CF sputum in vitro. Specifically, we measured the elasticity (G'), loss modulus (G'') and phase angle of sputum. Non-induced CF sputum samples were collected from adolescent patients at the Cystic Fibrosis Unit at the Children's Hospital for Wales. Sputum aliquots (2.5 mL) were prepared and gently inverted for 30 s with the following test agents: dornase alfa (Pul-mozyme\u00ae; 2.5 \u00b5g mL -1 ), saline and the test agent OligoG at <2% (in dH 2 O). Combinatorial effects of the agents with OligoG were studied, with control samples treated with dH 2 O alone. Samples and test agents were incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C prior to testing. Rheological measurements were conducted using an AR-G2 Controlled Stress Rheometer (TA Instruments, UK) fitted with a parallel plate geometry; the lower plate being maintained at 4\u00b0C. Frequency sweep tests were employed over a range of frequencies (0.1-10 Hz) to provide viscoelastic data. Results showed that treatment with OligoG resulted in an 8.7-66% decrease in log 10 sample elasticity compared to the control over the range of 0.1 Hz-4 Hz. In these experiments, the value of the phase angle of the treated samples was approximately three-times greater than that of the control. OligoG treatment also decreased the elasticity of Pulmozyme\u00ae-treated samples, although this failed to reach the levels observed with OligoG alone. These studies demonstrate the ability of Oli-goG to effectively disrupt CF sputum in vitro, reduce elasticity and potentiate the action of Pulmozyme\u00ae. The potential of OligoG in the treatment of CF patients in vivo is under investigation in a phase IIa study.",

In preparation for a multi-dose clinical trial to assess whether 12 monthly doses of the CFTR gene can improve CF lung disease we have conducted two toxicology studies (TS). In addition to a GLP-mouse TS study (outsourced to a CRO) we also performed an in-house study in sheep. Mice received 12 doses of pGM169 (a plasmid carrying the CFTR gene) complexed to Genzyme lipid GL67A at fortnightly intervals by inhalation; exposure to the complex was for 0.5 (low= ~5x human dose), 2 (mid= ~ 20x human dose) or 6 hr (high dose=~60x human dose). Controls were exposed to air for 6 hr. In addition to standard non-invasive assessments at regular intervals and post-mortem toxicology undertaken 2 weeks and 3 months after the last dose, molecular analyses were performed to assess gene expression and biodistribution (separate abstract). Approximately 600 mice were included in the study. Anesthetised sheep (n=8) received 9 doses (consistent with EMEA guidelines) of aerosolized pGM169/GL67A at monthly intervals. Similar assessments were made as for the mouse TS, in addition to lung function measurements and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at intervals throughout the study. The amount (mg/kg) of pGM169/GL67A delivered to sheep approximately mimics the proposed human dose. Anesthetised controls (n=8) received air only.",

The transient and dose-related systemic inflammatory responses and drop in lung function observed in the single-dose phase 1 trial (separate abstract) were not replicated in non-CF sheep and non-CF mice only developed mild systemic inflammation at the highest dose (~60x human dose) possibly highlighting species-specific differences or an increased response to the lipid/DNA complexes in the inflamed human CF lung. Both TS support progression into a multi-dose CF gene therapy trial. Rationale: Until now, involvement of the upper airways and paranasal sinuses in CF did not receive much attention as only three decades ago the inherited disease led to premature death in preschool age. However, in computed tomography almost 100% of CF paranasal sinuses are pathologic and only 7% of CF patients did not reveal clinical or cytological signs of rhinosinusitis. Recent studies showed, that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) impairs quality of life and overall health in CF to a much higher extent than expected. In this regard, the upper airways were detected as a site of primary and persistent pathogen colonization. Cross colonization between airway levels was proven, as we previously identified 96% of P. aeruginosa pairs from the upper and lower airways of CF patients as identical by genotype.",

RS and EF were associated with increased scores in the AZLI group, whereas significant AZLI-PBO differences in the other domains were largely based on stable domain scores with AZLI vs declining PBO scores. When evaluated over 18 months of open label AZLI use, mean change from baseline in domain scores varied as a function of AZLI treatment, with improvement at the end of AZLI treatment and worsening at the end of the off-AZLI periods. Notable responses to AZLI treatment were observed for RS and BW, with scores remaining above baseline at all visits during the 18 month study. V, HP, and DS were consistently above baseline values following AZLI and occasionally following off-periods. Other domains were less affected by treatment, with PF, RF, EF, SF, BI and TB trending lower through the study. PF, RF, V, HP, RS, and BW consistently increased during 28 day AZLI period and fell during each offperiod. Regardless of changes in magnitude, the directional changes in domain scores consistently increased during the 28 day AZLI period and declined during the off period in most domains.

They do not shed light on the immunopathology of CFA. Further studies are ongoing as biomarkers are urgently needed to aid the investigation, diagnosis and management of CFA. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting recessive disease in the U.S. and Europe, and is due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CF mutations, of which the most common is \u2206F508-CFTR, cause a massive pro-inflammatory phenotype in the lung arising from profound expression of inflammatory genes, including interleukin-8 (IL-8). We have previously reported that IL-8 mRNA is stabilized in CF lung epithelial cells, and that IL-8 protein expression is concomitantly massively over-expressed. However, the mechanistic link between mutations in CFTR, and acquisition of the pro-inflammatory phenotype in the CF airway, has remained elusive. We have hypothesized that specific microRNAs might mediate this linkage. To identify the potential link, we have screened a miRNA library for differential expression in \u2206F508-CFTR and WT-CFTR lung epithelial cell lines. Of the 22 differentially and significantly expressed miRNAs, we find that expression of miR-155 is more than 5-fold elevated in CF IB3-1 lung epithelial cells in culture, compared to control daughter IB3-1/S9 cells, repaired with WT-CFTR. Clinically, miR-155 is also highly expressed in lung epithelial cells, and circulating CF neutrophils biopsied from CF patients. Our data indicate that elevation in miR-155 expression is closely tied to failure of CFTR channel activity. We report here that high levels of miR-155 specifically reduce levels of SHIP1, thereby preventing Akt from being activated by the PI3K pathway. However, raising the level of SHIP1 in CF cells, either by an expression SHIP1 vector, or by an anti-sense antagomir-155, results in destabilization of IL-8 mRNA and reduced expression of IL-8 protein. Finally, we find that phospho-AKT levels are elevated in CF lung epithelial cells, and are specifically lowered by either antagomir-155, the antisense construct for miR-155, or elevated expression of SHIP1. We therefore suggest that elevated miR-155 contributes to the pro-inflammatory stabilization of IL-8 mRNA in CF lung epithelial cells, by lowering SHIP1 expression, and thereby activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These data suggest that miR-155 may play an important role in the activation of IL-8 dependent inflammation in CF lung epithelial cells. The efficacy of antagomir-155 will thus be further analyzed in primary cells, both lung epithelial and circulating neutrophils, obtained from CF patients. Recent studies have shown that N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) can modulate fatty acid levels, including PUFAs, in the plasma of CF mice. The exact mechanism by which 4-HPR exerts its effect is still largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesize that 4-HPR corrects fatty acid imbalance in a cultured bronchial CF cell model through modulation of desaturation and/or elongation of fatty acids.",

Cigarette smoke exposure is also associated with reduced CFTR activity in healthy smokers in vivo, suggesting an acquired form of CFTR dysfunction. VX-770, a CFTR potentiator, rescues Cltransport in CF but has not been evaluated in acquired forms of CFTR dysfunction. We examined the effects of CSE exposure on mucus transport and tested whether a CFTR potentiator can ameliorate effects in vitro, while demonstrating in vivo effects of smoking on COPD airways. WT human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) were exposed to CSE (2%) for 24 h and mounted in Ussing chambers to measure transepithelial Clconductance. Nasal potential difference (NPD) studies measured in vivo Clconductance with KCl calomel electrodes and 3% agar catheters. Lower airway potential difference (LAPD) was performed similarly and under conscious sedation. HBE data showed that 2% CSE exposure for 24 h reduced CFTR-dependent cAMP-mediated current in HBEs (65% of control, P<0.05) without altering transepithelial resistance. Western blots confirmed reduced CFTR, as did relative mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR (0.66 CSE vs. 1.07 control, P<0.01).

In CSEexposed cells, VX-770 rescued Isc, increasing CFTR activity from 72.7% of WT following CSE treatment to 185.8% of WT with VX-770 (P<0.05). VX-770 also augmented forskolin (100 nM)-dependent Isc in human trachea explants (4.7 \u00b5A/cm 2 VX-770 vs. 1.4 control, P<0.05), including those from smokers (10.1 \u00b5A/cm 2 vs. 3.3, P<0.05). Augmented ion transport also increased ASL depth (11.7 \u00b5m CSE+VX-770 vs. 8.0 \u00b5m CSE, P<0.005) and MCT (0.085 mm/min vs. 0.009, P<0.005). Cigarette smoke exposure is causally related to reduced MCT in COPD by inhibiting CFTR activity and enhancing mucus expression. CFTR potentiators may represent a therapeutic strategy to address acquired CFTR dysfunction in smoking-related lung disease. Examination of intestinal ion transport characteristics in human rectal biopsies represents a flexible means to monitor CFTR function ex vivo, and may provide a means to quantitate restored or partial CFTR function in patient derived tissues. We investigated the capacity of real time tissue conductance monitoring during intestinal current measurements (ICM) to quantitate CFTR activity in non-CF controls compared with CF patients possessing two severe CFTR mutations. Sixty-three subjects (45 non-CF controls, 15 CF adults) were enrolled in a prospective trial across three study sites using common equipment and SOPs. Data from 44 controls and 13 CF subjects were suitable for analysis. Common voltage clamps, tissue mounts (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA), buffer conditions, and tissue dissection were used. Biopsies were warmed to 37\u00b0C and gassed with 95%O 2 /5%CO 2 in RPMI 1640 media + 25 mM HCO 3 . Tissues were voltage clamped to continuously monitor short circuit current and resistance. Tissue was treated with 10 \u00b5M indomethacin (20 min) followed by amiloride (100 \u00b5M, 15 min). CFTR currents were stimulated with 10 \u00b5M forskolin + 100 \u00b5M IBMX (20 minutes), followed by carbachol (100 \u00b5M, serosal) to activate basolateral K + channels and further potentiate CFTR-dependent Isc. Serosal bumetanide (100 \u00b5M) was then added to block Cltransport. The change in conductance during the different reagent conditions were compared between the CF and non-CF subjects, and data was analyzed as percent of wildtype CFTR conductance observed in the CF patients (12 F508del/F508del, 1 E60X/621 G-T). Tissue slope conductance for the entire tracing for the CF patients (percent of wildtype) was 21.42% (\u00b136.5, SD). The slope conductance following indomethacin and amiloride was 14.67% (\u00b130.8), 11.24% (\u00b127.7) following stimulation with forskolin/IBMX, and 11.62% (\u00b139.7) following treatment with the Na/K/2Cl tranporter blocker bumetanide. The largest separation in slope conductance was seen following CCh stimulation, with CF tissues achieving only 3.24% (\u00b147.4) of wtCFTR controls. The %wtCFTR conductance coefficient was calculated as the ratio of CF to non-CF responses for each aligned time point. We used a linear mixed model to assess changes in %wtCFTR over time overall and during post-Amil, -Bum, -CCh and -cAMP. The overall %wtCFTR conductance decreased over time by 0.0042\u00b10.0023%/sec (p=0.0410). We observed significant rates of change in %wtCFTR conductance post-Bum (0.0127\u00b10.0019%/sec), post-CCh (0.0391\u00b10.0081%/sec), and post-cAMP (-0.0207\u00b10.0015%/sec); all p<0.0001. The %wtCFTR conductance was fairly constant post-Amil. The results indicate that monitoring transepithelial conductance after stimulation of CFTR (apical membrane) and K channels (basolateral membrane) by the combination of forskolin/IBMX and CCh in the presence of amiloride and indomethacin provided the greatest mean separation between CF and non-CF controls, and related analysis may represent a valuable electrophysiologic tool to assess and quantify partial function or restoration of mutant CFTR function in patient tissues ex vivo. Supported by CFFT. To date, all previous studies of PCT have excluded patients with CF; therefore, no normative data exists in this group. Moreover, a marker of acute bacterial infection in CF patients experiencing exacerbation would be useful. The purpose of this study was to determine the baseline PCT levels in patients with CF. Moreover; we sought to determine the ability of PCT to serve as a biomarker of acute pulmonary exacerbation.",

The serum PCT concentration in healthy persons is below 0.05 ng/mL; this is not different from the mean PCT in non-exacerbated CF patients. The mean PCT in patients with exacerbation was 0.078 \u00b10.028 ng/mL on day 1. PCT value trended down within the first 24hrs. There was a 61.2 \u00b1 13.2% decrease in PCT after initiation of antibiotics in hospital compared to baseline. Although PCT was increased during exacerbations, values never reached the recommended values needed to initiate antibiotics >0.2ng/mL. On the basis of serum procalcitonin concentrations during COPD exacerbation and lower respiratory tract infection, use of antibiotics was discouraged when PCT was between 0.1 and 0.25 mcg/L and encouraged with PCT >0.25 mcg/L. Conclusions: Our finding demonstrated low baseline PCT levels in people with CF during routine office visits; comparable to baseline PCT levels in general populations in the absence of bacterial infections. During exacerbation, PCT levels doubled but did not reach the recommended value to initiate antibiotic therapy in septic patients. Elevated level of PCT is an independent predictor of vesicoureteral reflux in children with a febrile urinary tract infection. Furthermore, PCT allows early assessment of pancreatic infections and stratification of patients at risk to develop major complications if PCT is above 3.5 mcg/L. Based on our results, pulmonary exacerbations of CF may not generally be \"systemic enough\" to drive an increase in PCT. However, as there was universally a decrease in PCT levels in association with antibiotic therapy with concomitant clinical improvement, this biomarker may provide a signal in improvement in pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis. Further study is required to determine the time course of PCT in association with treatment of pulmonary exacerbation. Mortality in cystic fibrosis is most commonly a result of persistent bacterial infection in the lungs due to reduced mucociliary clearance. The bacteria found in chronically infected CF lungs have been observed to have undergone genetic changes over time that lead to adaptation to the lung environment. Here we present a model of chronic infection using a mucus simulant and mice overexpressing the \u03b2 subunit of the epithelial sodium channel scnn1 (\u03b2ENaC) that produces spontaneous mutation of Pseudomonas. In this model chronic, stable airways-specific infections can be established and maintained for up to three weeks. The bacterial load in this model does not significantly change over the course of the experiment and leads to a chronic mucopurulent obstructive inflammatory response in the airways characterized by neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mucus overproduction leading to obstruction of the airways. Bacteria cultured from these mice are observed to form phenotypically distinct colonies. These distinct colony morphologies persist through passage, indicating that the changes are genetic in nature. Among the colony morphologies found was a mucoid phenotype, which was then found to possess a mutation in the mucA repressor, a common mutation leading to mucoidy in bacteria found in CF lungs, and associated with exacerbation in CF patients. To address the role mucoidy and other phenotypes play in CF exacerbations, various Pseudomonas mutants, including the mucoid mucA22 strain, were instilled in C57/Black6 mice with mucus simulant at a dose that is completely cleared within 14 days when control strain PAK Pseudomonas is used. However, mucA22 infected animals fail to clear infection and become rapidly moribund. Furthermore, Pseudomonas possessing mutations that promote pathways responsible for biofilm formation are capable of establishing chronic infections in wild type mice using mucus simulant. Most CF infections are clonal, meaning that the infecting population is composed of the progeny of a single isolate. In preliminary studies, we found that infecting P. aeruginosa strains evolve to produce genetically diverse (but clonally-related) subpopulations during the course of infection. Furthermore, these evolved subpopulations differ in traits known to affect host inflammatory and injury responses. The mechanisms that drive and sustain genetic diversity within the airway are poorly understood.",

This effect, combined with the geographic isolation of bacteria caused by their encasement in viscous mucus, could generate and maintain diversity. To test this hypothesis, we obtained secretions from the major lobar divisions of explanted CF lungs using a technique that minimized contamination from adjacent anatomic areas. Several hundred P. aeruginosa isolates from each major lobar segment were subjected to a battery of phenotypic tests, which when used in combination, could identify distinct subpopulations. DNA fingerprinting studies confirmed that these subpopulations were the progeny of an ancestral strain. These experiments showed that unique P. aeruginosa subpopulations inhabit specific anatomic regions of the CF lung. In some cases, different regions contained mixtures of isolates that differed in composition. In other cases, certain regions were dominated by a single P. aeruginosa subpopulation that differed from the bacteria present elsewhere. Future studies defining the functional characteristics of P. aerugi-nosa subpopulations and the environmental conditions that differ in lung segments, could increase our understanding of the mechanisms driving the evolution of P. aeruginosa diversity during CF infections. Recent work indicates that during infection, P. aeruginosa evolves to produce a diverse population within CF airways. However, the effect of this infecting population diversity on disease manifestations is not well understood. Experiments in laboratory and natural ecosystems show that diverse populations thrive over a greater range of conditions as compared to homogeneous populations. In addition, diverse populations can undergo changes in the relative abundance of subpopulations, and these changes could affect population functioning. Here we tested two hypotheses about the effect of P. aeruginosa population diversity on CF infections.",

            "text": "First, we hypothesized that increases in the relative abundance of specific subpopulations may sustain the infection during periods of antibiotic treatment. Second, we hypothesized that changes in subpopulation abundance occur during pulmonary exacerbations and may contribute to these events. To test these hypotheses we collected sputum samples from CF patients when they were clinically \"well,\" at the onset of an exacerbation, and during antibiotic therapy. Several hundred P. aeruginosa isolates from each clinical period were subjected to a battery of phenotypic tests that measured heritable traits. These experiments showed that each CF patient harbored a diverse population of P. aeruginosa isolates evolved from a single unique ancestral strain. Furthermore we found marked changes in P. aeruginosa subpopulation prevalence during transitions from the \"well\" state, to exacerbation onset, and during antibiotic treatment. To better understand the functional effects of these infecting population changes, we compared the proteomes of isolates from dominant subpopulations when patients were \"well,\" in exacerbation, and under treatment using reverse phase LC/MS/MS. This analysis identified significant functional changes in the bacterial population. Studies of additional patients may reveal bacterial mechanisms that could explain the pathogenesis of exacerbations, and mechanisms that lead to treatment resistance. Infection with bacteria belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) in cystic fibrosis (CF) is marked by an unpredictable clinical course that can range from an almost asymptomatic colonisation to a rapidly fatal necrotizing pneumonia known as 'cepacia syndrome.' A distinguishing feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF is initial infection with nonmucoid isolates, which upon establishment of chronic infection, subsequently convert to a mucoid phenotype through the elaboration of copious quantities of exopolysaccharide (EPS). Conversion to the mucoid phenotype in P. aeruginosa is generally considered to be associated with in an increased decline in health. BCC are also capable of EPS production, although until recently the prevalence of the ability to produce EPS in clinical isolates of BCC bacteria was not fully appreciated. We have shown, through a retrospective analysis of isolates from patients attending the Vancouver clinics, that although EPS production is common in clinical isolates of BCC bacteria, the more apparently virulent isolates were nonmucoid. When an EPS phenotype switch occurred in a chronic infection it was usu-ally from mucoid to nonmucoid. Importantly, there was also an inverse relationship between EPS production and both lung function decline and survival. Furthermore, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of a clonal pair of mucoid/nonmucoid isolates revealed an overexpression of factors known to be associated with virulence in the nonmucoid isolate. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that in BCC infections the mucoid phenotype is associated with chronic and persistent infections, whereas the nonmucoid phenotype is more aggressive and results in a worse outcome for CF patients infected with BCC. Here we present data on the contribution of the mucoid phenotype to virulence in human cellular models of infection. We also show there is no apparent link between serum resistance and the mucoid phenotype. Background: Chronic Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection is a risk factor for pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients but its impact on subsequent clinical outcomes is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic S. maltophilia infection and associated antimicrobial therapy on the recovery of forced expiratory lung volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) following pulmonary exacerbation.",

Biofilm populations are known to harbor great diversity, but the importance of this diversity is not fully understood. For example, during chronic infections Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) commonly diversifies into genetically distinct colony morphologies from a single, founding clone. To study this process we experimentally evolved three populations founded by strain PA14 under conditions favoring a regular cycle of biofilm formation and dispersal (Poltak, S.R. and Cooper, V.S., ISME Journal 2010) for 90 days. Each population evolved extensive ecological diversity, likely in response to the lifestyle switch from planktonic to biofilm growth and reflecting distinct strategies within the biofilm. Heritable colony phenotypes commonly associated with CF infections and biofilm formation (small colony variants) arose in each population; such mutants also associated with changes in the regulation of virulence factors, autolysis, and auto-aggregative behavior. Moreover, this diversity is critical for fitness of the biofilm community: subtraction of single variants reduced fitness of the diverse community, and the loss of certain, rare variants caused large reductions in fitness and biofilm productivity. These results suggest that the synergy of diverse biofilms depends on a balance of ecotypes. Diversity appears to be maintained by variation in the temporal dynamic of biofilm assembly, whereby early founders in the 24h growth cycle create substrates for attachment of later types. To probe the molecular basis of evolved biofilm diversity, we manipulated concentrations of the molecule cyclic-di-GMP that underlies the switch from planktonic to biofilm life at elevated concentrations. A plasmid encoding an inducible phosphodiesterase (PDE) to degrade cyclic-di-GMP was added to each of seven different members of this community. The fitness of mixed populations containing a single ecotype expressing the PDE, lacking an ecotype, or unaltered, was then quantified. Although some individual mutants were more fit when expressing the PDE, community fitness always declined, and usually to the extent observed when mutants were removed entirely. This result demonstrates that cyclic-di-GMP contributes to the fitness of populations as well as individuals and suggests a novel testable mechanism for how mutants interact in biofilms. In summary, synergistic benefits of diversity may evolve in PA biofilms owing to niche partitioning that is partly defined by varying levels of cyclic-di-GMP. Certain rare variants appear to disproportionately influence biofilm fitness and hence targeting these types may substantially reduce biofilm resilience. This experimental model can be used to rapidly and consistently generate diverse biofilm communities that can elucidate mechanisms involved in the adaptation of pathogens to a chronic biofilm lifestyle.",

Background: Twenty percent of CF patients (pts) admitted for antibiotic IV treatment develop an immediate adverse reaction to the medication(s), and it may sometimes be difficult evaluating if a proper desensitisation protocol may be needed before using the drug again. Desensitisation is a complex, time-consuming and high-risk procedure, and it is ideally performed in an intensive care unit. Besides, complications potentially connected with desensitisation may be more difficult to manage in patients with severe lung disease, as is often the case in CF. We performed skin tests in order to differentiate IgE-mediated reactions and possibly non IgE-mediated reactions. In the latter group the antibiotic which had given the reaction was gradually reintroduced according to a protocol which did not implicate desensitisation.",

Chronic pulmonary disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Increasing evidence has demonstrated that CF airways harbor a diversity of species and that airway community composition is highly correlated with pulmonary health status. However, the dynamics of airway microbiome and host immune response during distinct clinical states (e.g. pulmonary stability and acute exacerbation) remain unknown. To explore microbiota dynamics and host response, we examined temporal sputum samples collected from four CF patients experiencing distinct pulmonary states. Bacterial communities were profiled using a phylogenetic microarray (16S rRNA PhyloChip), and for two of the patients we performed parallel high-resolution metaproteomic analyses of their samples (n = 10). Our results demonstrate subtle shifts in gross bacterial community composition upon onset of acute pulmonary exacerbation, followed by dramatic changes upon antibiotic treatment, and an eventual return towards a baseline community 1-3 months post-treatment with concomitant lung function recovery. Ordination analysis of the metaproteomic profiles of 2 patients revealed distinct clustering of protein expression profiles from stable or exacerbation samples, irrespective of patient or antibiotic administration. This suggests that a number of distinct and definable host responses, including S100, myleoperoxidase and defensin proteins are differentially expressed in stable and exacerbation states. This research establishes an effective global strategy to investigate the dynamic relationship between airway microbiota and host response in CF patients. Background: Pulmonary exacerbations are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. The CF airway contains complex polymicrobial communities that likely contribute to pulmonary exacerbation; however, little is known about the airway microbiome during treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation.",

We expect to enroll 160 patients who will be followed for 3 years with a projected total of >900 specimens. We have completed 16S sequencing for 90 samples. Preliminary data suggests that exacerbations are associated with only modest changes in microbial diversity with microbial communities remaining relatively stable. Our results underscore the importance of anaerobic bacteria in cystic fibrosis. Greater than 92% of specimens are positive for organisms from the genus Prevotella, and greater than 89% are positive for Veillonella. By comparison, only approximately 40%-50% are positive for Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus species. These data suggest that anaerobes are abundant and important members of the CF respiratory microbiota. These findings have fundamentally altered understanding of CF lung disease. However, sampling lung secretions in living subjects requires that expectorated specimens or collection devices pass through the oropharynx, which harbors extensive microbial diversity. Thus, contamination could confound results. Here we directly sampled CF lungs removed at the time of transplantation and used non-culture based analysis of lung secretions to compare throat and sputum samples obtained several hours earlier. To date we have sampled ten lungs, seven having paired sputum and/or throat swab samples. We found that CF lungs with advanced disease contained relatively homogenous populations of typical CF pathogens, whereas upper airway specimens from the same patients showed markedly higher levels of microbial diversity. Furthermore, sputum samples exhibited significant day-today variation in microbial composition, consistent with varying levels of oropharyngeal contamination. These findings highlight the importance of sampling procedures for microbiome studies, and suggest that new methods are needed to validate data when DNA-based methods are used on specimens prone to contamination. In addition to the well-known facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria, also a variety of obligate anaerobes are found in sputum of children and adults with CF. The derivation of the bacteria remains unclear. Here, we investigated if periodontal pockets may present a potential source for obligate anaerobes, if the bacteria can already be found in young CF children, and if the bacteria in the lung and the oral cavity are related.",

Furthermore, BAL cultures yielded new microbial findings more frequently than sinus aspiration cultures. The identification of new bacterial species by BAL resulted in a change in antibacterial treatment in nearly half of cases, while the identification of new fungi resulted in the initiation of anti-fungal treatment in 25% of cases. This data supports the use of BAL during FESS as a means of surveillance for CF airway pathogens. A prospective, randomized study comparing BAL/FESS to the use of standard surveillance with sputum or OP cultures is warranted to further determine the clinical benefits of this procedure. Introduction: Recent microbiological surveillance using molecular typing (genotyping) has provided compelling evidence for P. aeruginosa cross-infection at many cystic fibrosis (CF) centres around the world. The transmissible strains responsible for this cross-infection pose an increased risk for acquisition of infection for patients currently free of P. aeruginosa. As transmissible strains are often resistant to multiple antibiotics they may also be more difficult to eradicate, at present there is a paucity of evidence regarding this. The objective of this study was to assess the success rate of eradication for transmissible strains of P. aeruginosa.",

            "text": "Conclusions: The low rate of eradication success for transmissible strains of P. aeruginosa is in contrast to that for sporadic strains which is around 80%. This implies that multi-resistant transmissible strains of P. aeruginosa present an increased risk to patients with CF through both the increased risk of acquisition and the subsequent increased progression to chronic infection secondary to eradication failure. Prevention can only be achieved by the implementation of infection control measures and the success of these measures should be judged by continued microbiological surveillance. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a well known genetic disorder that significantly decreases life expectancy. Patients become chronically infected with bacteria which are major contributors to lung tissue destruction, bronchiectasis and decrease in lung function. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most clinically relevant chronic colonizing pathogens found in the lungs of CF patients. Biofilms have been identified as an important step in the progression of chronic diseases and Pseudomonas has been shown to form biofilms within the lungs of CF patients. Biofilms are a group of bacteria that grow in a community and are encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix. The matrix serves to protect the bacteria from environmental stresses including host immune defenses and therapeutic modalities. It is very important to understand biofilm structure in order to develop better methods to prevent bacterial infection as well as to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of CF. There has been much research to date to identify components of biofilm matrices that may be targets for future therapies and potential vaccines. Recent work highlights extracellular DNA (eDNA) as a key component common to many pathogenic biofilms. The DNABII family of proteins is known to bind to DNA and one of these proteins, IHF, has been shown to exist extracellularly. We hypothesize that the binding of IHF to the eDNA within the bacterial biofilm might provide structural stability to the biofilm matrix present within the lungs of patients with CF and thereby provide a potential target for future therapies.",

At Texas Children's Hospital (TCH), pharmacists manage aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics for the CF population. For years, the standard of care at TCH was to utilize conventional aminoglycoside therapy (CAT), or every eight hour dosing. Our conventional protocol resulted in difficult therapeutic drug monitoring as evidenced by frequent dose changes and numerous blood draws for serum aminoglycoside (AG) concentrations. Therefore, a pharmacist-managed ODT protocol was developed with the hypothesis that it would reduce the number of dose changes and decrease the time from therapy initiation to the first documented therapeutic peak concentration.",

            "text": "Supported by the US CF Foundation. Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. P. aeruginosa forms airway biofilms in CF patients and produces a battery of exoproducts and virulence factors in a population-density dependent manner, a process called quorum sensing. In P. aeruginosa, quorum sensing is mediated in part by the transcription factor LasR. Although LasR is required to activate expression of a number of virulence functions in P. aeruginosa, mutations of LasR can be frequent among P. aeruginosa isolated from CF patients with chronic infection. Such mutations are not generally seen in other acute infections. There are several possible explanations for why LasR mutants evolve in the CF lung environment. For instance, some, but not all, LasR-mutant strains have been shown to grow more effectively in high-nitrate conditions or with phenylalanine as the sole source of carbon and energy. These LasR mutant strains may also be \"social cheaters\" that benefit from the secreted and excreted products made by wildtype bacteria without incurring the metabolic cost of their production. We wondered why a small percentage of the genes controlled by LasR coded for cellular enzymes needed for growth on transported solutes. For such carbon and energy sources the functional benefit is restricted to the cell in which the enzymes are produced. We hypothesized that one consequence of maintaining a few such activities under LasR control would be to restrain the emergence of LasR mutants in P. aeruginosa populations. We focused our investigations on the LasR-dependent nuh gene product, a cellular enzyme required for growth on adenosine. Consistent with previous reports, we found that growth of P. aeruginosa on sodium caseinate as the sole carbon and energy source requires LasR-quorum-sensing-controlled exoprotease production, and that LasR mutants emerge during prolonged growth on caseinate. The social cheaters reach a stable equilibrium of about 25-40% of the population under the conditions of our experiments. LasR mutants did not emerge when we included adenosine as an additional carbon and energy source. As a control we substituted glucose (glucose metabolism is not dependent on quorum sensing) for adenosine and the emergence of social cheaters was not restrained. When a stable population of LasR mutants and wildtype bacteria growing on caseinate alone was transferred to a combination of caseinate and adenosine we observed a strong selection against the LasR mutants, which fell rapidly to undetectable levels. Together, these results demonstrate that LasR regulation of transported-solute catabolism can prevent the emergence of LasR mutant social cheaters. That is, there is a genetic basis for the capability of the group to eliminate encroaching social cheaters. These laboratory findings about P. aeruginosa ecology further our understanding of the factors that may encourage or discourage the emergence of LasR mutations in P. aeruginosa-infected CF patients.",

As a host defense strategy, mammals have evolved the ability to limit bacterial growth by producing antibacterial iron-depleting innate immune defense proteins such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) that specifically scavenge bacterial siderophores, therefore preventing bacteria from establishing infection. P. aeruginosa produces fluorescent siderophores (pyoverdines) found to be important for biofilm development and bacterial virulence. It is not known if P. aeruginosa strains persisting in CF lungs evade NGAL recognition. The aim of this work is to determine if pyoverdine binds to the antibacterial protein NGAL.",

We used enterobactin as a control, and as expected, enterobactin bound to NGAL causing strong tryptophan quenching. The data indicate that the major siderophore of P. aeruginosa, pyoverdine, evades NGAL recognition therefore dysregulating host ironlimiting innate defenses. We then investigated whether pyoverdine modulates other innate immune defenses such as respiratory burst. Upon phagocytosis of invading pathogen, respiratory burst is triggered as a defense mechanism that leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) release which is important for the oxidative killing of invading pathogens. We observed that pyoverdine decreased ROS release when added at the peak of the respiratory burst in THP-1 cells primed with P. aeruginosa LPS (10 pmol/mL) and detected using the chemiluminescent probe lucigenin. The data suggest that pyoverdine dampens the respiratory burst possibly by scavenging released ROS to spare the oxidative killing of invading P. aeruginosa. Taken together, our data suggest that pyoverdine is a stealth siderophore and a virulence factor that helps P. aeruginosa evade the ROS mediated oxidative killing.",

University of Maryland-Baltimore, Baltimore, MD, USA Bacterial activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway has been demonstrated to be important in the clearance of mucosal pathogens. In Gram negative infections the LPS/TLR4/TRIF signaling pathway is a major inducer of the type I IFN cascade. The immunogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa changes over the course of colonization of the CF lung due to alterations in virulence factor expression, therefore we hypothesize that alterations in LPS structure reduces bacterial activation of the type I IFN cascade. Our hypothesis was tested by stimulating (4 hours) human immune (primary dendritic cells (DC) and THP-1) cells and epithelial (BEAS-2B) with P. aeruginosa strains isolated from single CF patients at early (3 or 5 months) and late (14 years) stages of colonization. Analysis of the strains by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) confirmed that early and late isolates shared a common genetic background. Activation of NF\u03baB (IL-8) and IFN (IFN\u03b2) signaling was measured by RT-PCR in DCs and THP-1 immune cells, or luciferase reporter and ELISA in the BEAS-2B epithelial cells. Stimulation with the early isolate induced higher levels of NF\u03baB signaling activation in DC (9.81 and 3.81 fold of unstimulated) and THP-1 (5.26 and 2.62 fold of unstimulated) immune cells compared with late isolates, however similar induction levels were observed in BEAS-2B (6.10 and 7.89 fold of unstimulated) cells. NF\u03baB signaling in the BEAS-2B was confirmed by ELISA analysis of IL-8 in the supernatant of cells stimulated with early and late isolates (113.9 and 215.6 pg/mL). Induction of IFN signaling by the early isolate was also higher than that induced by the late isolate in DC (10.10 and 3.86 fold to unstimulated) and THP-1 (4.98 and 1.85 fold to unstimulated) cells. Interestingly, IFN signaling induction by the early isolate was also higher in the epithelial BEAS-2B line compared to levels induced by the late isolate (14.14 and 8 fold to unstimulated). This data demonstrates that during colonization P. aeruginosa loses its immunostimulatory capacity in a host cell type and pathway dependent manner. To support our hypothesis that alterations to LPS are responsible for the reduction in P. aeruginosa immunostimulatory capacity we stimulated murine nasal epithelial cells with the different P. aeruginosa isolates. Unlike human TLR4, activation of murine TLR4 is unaffected by alterations in LPS structure. We observed no difference in NF\u03baB (21.73 and 22.71 fold to unstimulated) or IFN (228.1 and 278.2 fold to unstimulated) signaling by RT-PCR in murine epithelial cells. Therefore we concluded that modifications in P. aeruginosa virulence factors, most likely LPS, reduce the immunogenicity of the organism resulting in reduced activation of the type I IFN pathway, a potential mechanism by which the pathogen evades clearance by the host.",

H1N1 pts had lower baseline FEV1 (1.86 L vs 2.14 L). A 24% absolute increase in hospitalizations over 8 months was seen in the H1N1 group, with 10 (67%) H1N1 pts experiencing at least 1 re-admission compared to 55 in the control group (43%)(p=0.08). Ninety percent of re-admissions in the H1N1 group and 85% in the control group were due to PE. Other admissions were for hemoptysis, GI pain, emesis, ataxia and sinusitis. Time to 1st post-exposure hospitalization was similar in both groups (median 72 days, p=0.64). Thirteen percent absolute increase in PE was seen with H1N1 pts compared to control group (p=0.33). There was a 4-fold increase in mortality over 1 yr in the H1N1 group, with 50% during the exposure period. An 8-month PFT trend was analyzed prior to the designated exposure period (1/1/09-8/30/09) and compared to another 8-month PFT trend after the exposure period (1/1/10-8/30/10). Post-exposure period, H1N1 group showed an improvement in FEV1 (163cc/year) while the control group had a decline of 13cc/year. In contrast, both groups showed a decline in FEF25-75. Culture analysis demonstrated that 27% of H1N1 pts acquired a new organism after H1N1 exposure compared to 28% in the control group (p=1.00). New strains primarily comprised of MSSA,(67% H1N1 group vs 33% control) followed by PA (33% H1N1 group vs 30% control)(p=0.33).

A standardized sterile unit-dose HS solution is not available worldwide. Compounding pharmacies produce large-volume bottled solutions of 3-7% HS (multi-dose), which patients use for prolonged periods, without considering the risk of contamination. This study examined the sterility of multi-dose HS solutions in use for prolonged periods and also assessed the survival of CF-associated bacteria in HS solutions of different concentrations. The manner of use of these solutions by patients and staff was documented, in order to identify factors that might be associated with or affect bacterial contamination of the solutions.",

The potential clinical impact of MRSA in the pathogenesis of CF is gaining increased attention. Studies have shown that pulmonary function declines with MRSA infection and the mortality rate is increased among MRSA-positive patients. These observations and the expected continued emergence of resistance emphasize the need for effective strategies to prevent and treat MRSA colonization/infection in CF. Foremost among these include the availability of affordable antibiotics optimally formulated to ensure safety, efficacy and to limit long-term development of antimicrobial resistance. The additional recognition of MRSA strains with decreased susceptibility or complete resistance to vancomycin and the increasing prevalence of multiply drug-resistant staphylococci emphasize the critical need for effective alternative antimicrobials with unique modes of action for treatment of staphylococcal infections. Anti-microbial resistance patterns in MRSA collected from pediatric and adult patients treated at different CF centers in the US show that ~70% harbor hospital-associated MRSA, and 17% community-associated strains. These strains especially show a higher rate of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole of up to 10%, which is usually lower in both types of MRSA. Although clindamycin is often active in vitro, there is a high rate of clindamycin resistance seen in our results and in published reports.",

This may be ascribed to the presence of intracellular (IC) Small-Colony Variants (SCV), which are protected from immune defenses and antibiotics (AB). We have developed a model of S. aureus-infected THP-1 cells and used it to assess the IC activity of AB against a MRSA strain and its two stable menadione-and hemindependent SCVs. As the menadione-dependent strain shows a slower IC growth (see abstract 1130322), we also examined the effect of Menadione Sodium Bisulfite (MSB) supplementation on AB activity against this strain. Results: In non-activated THP-1, IC growth was slower (lower Emin) as well as the amplitude of the dose-response (Emin-Emax) for K8 than for the other strains, but both parameters were restored upon MSB supplementation. RIF and MXF reached an Emax > 1 log reduction against the three strains, and GEN and DOR against K8 only (note that DOR was active against IC SCV even if MRSA, as described for non-SCV strains [AAC 2007 [AAC , 51:1627 ). Static concentrations (Cs: extracellular concentration for which no change in IC inoculum is observed) were all close to the MICs (not shown). Dose-response curves for K10 matched those of K7. Activation of THP-1 cells is accompanied by an increase in AB accumulation (1.7, 1.8 and 3.9 for RIF, MXF and GEN, respectively) and a 2-to 15-fold increase in their AB potency (decrease in Cs [not shown]).",

Chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major severe complication in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where P. aeruginosa grows in biofilms in the endobronchial mucus under anaerobic conditions. Numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) surround the biofilm and create anaerobiosis by consuming the majority of O 2 for production of reactive oxygen radicals. We hypothesized that P. aeruginosa can acquire energy for growth in the anaerobic endobronchial mucus by denitrification, which can e.g. be demonstrated by production or degradation of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), an intermediate in the denitrification pathway.",

After P. aeruginosa biofilms were allowed to form on confluent CFBE cells for 6 hours, AZLI (700 \u00b5g/mL), tobramycin (1000 \u00b5g/mL) or a combination of both, were applied for 16 hours. Alternatively, antibiotics were added at the time of inoculation to assess their ability to impair biofilm formation. The antibiotic concentrations selected are clinically relevant. Bacteria (CFUs) remaining after treatment were then counted. CFUs recovered from untreated biofilms were used as control. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times.",

            "text": "Conclusions: The high degree of homology observed between MRSA isolates within each centre suggests the potential for patient-to-patient transmission of MRSA strains, and/or acquisition from a common source. Pediatric CF isolates are similar to endemic strains in the local healthcare setting, rather than specific CF clones, and studies investigating possible phenotypic differences between CF and non-CF MRSA are currently ongoing. The clonal nature of infection observed in sequential UW pediatric isolates suggests either repeated acquisition from the same source or, more likely, persistence within the patient. This study supports a role for rigorous infection control and appropriate decolonization strategies to prevent MRSA transmission and subsequent colonization/infection of CF patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of only a few bacterial species capable of synthesising hydrogen cyanide, a potent inhibitor of cellular respiration. Cyanide is detectable in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients infected with P. aeruginosa in concentrations of greater than 200 \u00b5M. We have previously shown that its presence is associated with significantly impaired lung function. In this work we explored possible mechanisms for this association, focusing on the effect of physiologically relevant cyanide concentrations on ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and cell viability. Ciliated strips of human nasal epithelium were obtained from the inferior turbinate of healthy volunteers with a cytology brush and CBF in the presence or absence of cyanide was measured at 37\u00b0C using light microscopy. The addition of 150 \u00b5M (n=6) or 75 \u00b5M (n=2) KCN resulted in a significant reduction in CBF compared with the same concentration of KCl used as a control (baseline 10.89 Hz; 150 \u00b5M CBF 5.96 Hz 46% fall; 75 \u00b5M 7.28 Hz 25% fall; p<0.005). The slowing was apparent at the first measurement (5 min) and was maximal by 30 min. To date, one sample from a patient with CF has shown similar results. Staining with trypan blue indicated that cell viability was not significantly different in KCN-treated and KCl-treated cells. Cyanide-induced slowing of CBF was reversible in that CBF recovered to control levels immediately after washing. We conclude that concentrations of cyanide similar to those detected in the sputum of CF patients cause a marked inhibition of ciliary function in vitro. If this was of a sufficient magnitude to impair mucociliary clearance in vivo, it could provide an explanation for the link with increased disease severity observed in CF patients with detectable levels of cyanide in the airway. Study objectives were 1) to describe the epidemiology of MRSA infections in children with CF from a highly prevalent area; and 2) to identify children persistently infected with MRSA and compare their outcome to the outcome of children who have never been infected or have intermittently been infected with MRSA.",

These data suggest ongoing upper airway colonisation following eradication treatment or re-acquisition from common environmental sources. Isolate genotypes derived from upper airway samples were also highly representative of those collected by BAL. Very few patients harboured Aust 01 and Aust 02 major clonal strains, while genotypes often associated with other ecological niches were particularly common in this cohort of young patients. The underlying mechanisms of CF lung disease remain unresolved. It is generally believed that reduced CFTR function alters transepithelial salt/water balance leading to a dehydrated airway surface and impairment in anti-bacterial defence mechanisms. Bacterial infections in the CF lung produce a hyperinflammatory response with persistent infiltration of immune cells. However, despite innate immune responses bacterial infections are not suppressed, suggesting the possibility of immune system dysregulation in the CF lung. Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a quorum sensing homoserine lactone (C12) that represses innate immune function by disrupting critical transcriptional responses mediated by nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). As such, P. aeruginosa may actively establish and maintain infections in CF, rather than merely flourishing in a favorable niche. We developed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecules that block C12 effects on NF-\u03baB signalling, to test whether C12-mediated inhibition of the innate immune response is a critical initial step in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. A stable FRT cell line was generated that expressed luciferase under the control of NF-\u03baB-response elements (FRT-NF-\u03baB cells). Stimulation of FRT-NF-\u03baB cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 \u00b5g/mL for 4 hours) produced a robust luminescence response that was suppressed completely by 25 \u00b5M C12. Primary screening of 25,600 drug-like synthetic small molecules gave several classes of active compounds that at micromolar concentrations reduced C12 suppression of NF-\u03baB signalling by >70%. Secondary screening of compound analogs identified triazoloquinolines as leads that restored NF-\u03baB-mediated transcriptional responses in LPS / C12treated cells with IC50 of 20-200 nM. Triazoloquinolines also restored NF-\u03baB-mediated transcriptional activity initiated by alternative stimuli including TNF\u03b1, and they restored production of TNF\u03b1, KC, IP-10, CCL2 and MIP-1\u03b1, -1\u03b2 and -2 in LPS / C12-treated macrophage cell lines and primary murine macrophages. Control experiments showed that triazoloquinolines are non-toxic and do not alter NF-\u03baB-mediated responses in unstimulated or stimulated cells. Compounds of the triazoloquinoline class have been used for other indications in vivo and our preliminary pharmacological analysis showed triazoloquinoline accumulation in the mouse lung hours after compound administration. Current efforts are focused on the testing of triazoloquinolines in mouse models of lung inflammation with LPS and infection with P. aeruginosa. Small-molecule C12 inhibitors should be useful in studying mechanisms of P. aeruginosa colonization and lung inflammation, and may provide a novel approach to treat P. aeruginosa infection in CF.",

To establish the host response to P. aeruginosa whole bacteria, we tested virulence of P. aeruginosa early and late clonal isolates in human CF bronchial epithelial cells IB3-1 and macrophage-like cells THP-1 by microarray analysis and ELISA. In IB3-1 cells P. aeruginosa early strains induced a stronger inflammatory response (IL-8, TNF-\u03b1) in comparison to late strains, while late strains up-regulated MMP9, liable for tissue damage.

While P. aeruginosa early strain was lethal and ineffective in inducing chronic infection, late strains were able to establish persistent infection with bacterial load ranging between 4*10 3 and 4*10 4 CFU/lung, induced leukocytes recruitment, and stimulated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines production (MIP-2, KC, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1) after 14 and 28 days of infection, as determined by Bioplex assay.

Our collection of cultured isolates from CF sputum includes 48 isolates that fall into nine distinct clades based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and may represent novel species within the Streptococcus genus. In addition to their potential for a direct role in disease progression, the streptococci are a potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance, due to their ability to undergo horizontal gene transfer, in addition to their naturally competent nature. The CF airway microbiome is under constant pressure from several prescribed antibiotics, resulting in increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and treatment failure.

This work was supported by NIH NCRR P20-RR021905. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) chronic pulmonary infections in CF patients are difficult to eradicate with current antimicrobials in part due to the formation of antibiotic resistant organized communities of bacteria or biofilms. New therapies aimed at disrupting or preventing biofilm formation that enhance the efficacy of currently available drugs are urgently needed. CORM-2 kills planktonic PA by releasing CO that binds to heme-containing oxidases of the respiratory chain stopping bacterial energy consumption. CO concentrations required for bacterial killing are not toxic for mammalian cell and exogenous administration of CO (100-500ppm) by inhalation is in phase I clinical trials as an anti-inflammatory agent (NCT00094406). While cell death during planktonic growth is well described, the ability of CORM-2 to affect PA biofilms and microcolony formation on epithelial cells has not been tested. We hypothesized that carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) attenuate PA biofilm formation and epithelial cell colonization. To assess the antimicrobial effects of CORM-2 on PAO1 surface colonization we examined biofilm formation and microcolony formation on human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o-). In vitro PAO1 biofilms were established by overnight growth in M9 medium with glucose in 24 well plastic dishes. The planktonic cells were removed and fresh medium with various doses of CORM-2 (25\u00b5M-100 \u00b5M), DMSO vehicle control, iCORM control (containing ruthenium but no CO), +/-tobramycin, were added to the biofilm. The biofilm was incubated with drug, washed and the biomass analyzed by crystal violet staining. The presence of CORM-2 reduced biofilm formation by 50% with doses as low as 25\u00b5M. This effect was observed as early as 1hr after drug addition and maintained for 6 hrs. CORM2-induced bacterial death within the biofilm was confirmed by colony forming unit (CFU) assay of dissociated bacteria after gentle sonication of the biofilm (2 log drop with 50\u00b5M CORM2 at 60min). Tobramycin (100\u00b5g/mL) alone also reduced CFU recovery from the biofilm by 2 logs after 60 minutes and the combination of both CORM-2 and tobramycin gave an additive effect. Time-lapse microscopy (VivaView, Olympus) of PAO1 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) attached to glass bottom dishes showed attenuation of biofilm formation after addition of CORM-2. For co-culture studies, 16HBE41o-cells seeded on glass-bottomed dishes were inoculated with PAO1-GFP at a 1:3 cell:bacteria/epithelial cell ratio for 40 minutes. After rinsing the unattached bacteria, the co-culture was visualized by time-lapse microscopy for 8 hours in presence of CORM2 (50\u00b5M) and/or of tobramycin (10\u00b5g/mL) or of controls (iCORM, DMSO). The epithelium integrity was monitored by differential interference contrast microscopy. CORM-2 prevented microcolony formation and epithelial cell damage over time and the combination of CORM-2 and tobramycin was again additive. This study demonstrates that CORM-2 alters PA surface colonization and identifies the PA electron transport chain as a potential target to design new drugs that attenuate PA biofilm formation. TSM and EMB contributed equally to the study. Rationale: Massively parallel DNA sequencing has enabled an explosion of data suggesting the presence of a diverse bacterial community in healthy and sick lungs, yet dogma dictates that normal lungs are predominantly sterile. Multiple defense mechanisms kill inhaled and aspirated bacteria, and include cough, mucociliary clearance, airway antimicrobial molecules and immune cells. Most studies of airway bacterial diversity have obtained samples using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected cytology brushes, which can result in contamination from the mouth and upper airways. Here, we investigated the relative contribution of the mouth and upper airways to bacterial counts and total bacterial DNA load in BAL samples, and asked whether most of the recovered DNA corresponds to live bacteria. We hypothesized that the distal airways would be sterile and that bacterial DNA in BAL samples would correspond to dead bacteria and sample contamination from mouth bacteria.",

Our data also confirm that using standard clinical precautions to obtain BAL results in significant mouth contamination of the sample. Careful consideration of these factors is therefore important when studying bacterial communities present in diseased lungs and comparing them to healthy lungs. aeruginosa (CRPA) strains at some European CF centers, and patient-topatient transmission has been reported at two such centers. The objective of this study was to assess retrospectively the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of CRPA in the U.S., in light of data indicating that chronic inhaled COL use here is more prevalent than generally recognized. As part of this study, ~1100 isolates referred from U.S. CF centers to the CF Synergy Lab (Columbia University) as MDR P. aeruginosa and initially tested as resistant or intermediate to COL during 2000 -2007 were transferred to a research repository, re-coded, re-speciated and re-tested; ~410 isolates were confirmed as CRPA. A limited data set that links isolate codes to specimen receipt dates and patient, center, and region codes enabled analysis of temporal trends and geographic relationships without revealing patient or center identities. Overall, 57 U.S. CF patients had \u22652 CRPA isolates, and 14 had \u22654 isolates. Sixteen U.S. centers were identified at which at least three patients had had at least one CRPA isolate cultured. Our analysis focused on three centers, each with a relatively large number of CRPA isolates: Center J, with 20 isolates collected from 15 patients; Center M, with 12 isolates from 10 patients; and Center N, with 13 isolates from 9 patients. About half of these isolates were highly COL resistant (MIC > 1024 mg/L, or 128-fold above the current CLSI-defined lower limit of resistance). The phoPQ, parRS, and pmrAB loci encode two-component systems (TCS) that regulate COL resistance mechanisms; mutations in these loci can lead to resistance. To understand the nature of such mutations in this set of 48 isolates, alleles of the phoQ (PA1180), parS (PA1799), and pmrB (PA4777) sensor kinase genes were sequenced. In Center J, 13 isolates derived from 10 patients shared a single distinct pmrB double mutation (all 13 isolates were WT at the phoQ and parS loci). MLST genotyping of these isolates performed through analysis of aroE (PA0025), trpE (PA0609), acsA (PA0887), ppsA (PA1770), and mutL (PA4946) confirmed that these 13 isolates represented a single clone shared among the patients. Additional shared strains with different phoQ, parS, and pmrB mutations were observed in all three centers, generally involving pairs of patients. While the molecular epidemiology suggests the occurrence of patient-to-patient transmission of CRPA strains within these centers, in the absence of contact tracing other possible modes of transmission such as spread from a non-CF point source cannot be excluded. Moreover, sharing of clonal CRPA isolates between patients at different centers has not yet been observed. This represents the first reported spread of CRPA strains within U.S. cystic fibrosis centers.",

Through in vitro and in vivo work, we have shown that the stringent response plays a critical role in the control of virulence in P. aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of great clinical relevance to patients with cystic fibrosis, many of whose lungs are colonized by this bacterium in the first few years of life. Most colonizing strains are thought to be environmental, but little work has been done to identify environmental habitats most important in lung colonization. Identifying potential habitats from which infections are acquired would facilitate targeted management of patient exposure through elimination of P. aeruginosa habitat or targeted cleaning. In this study we examine the distribution of P. aeruginosa in the human home environment. Ten households were enrolled in this study, 5 of which had a young child with CF, 5 of which did not. In each household up to 125 unique sites were sampled 4 times over the course of 1 year. These included sites in and on humans and pets (e.g. nose, mouth, eyes), as well as nonhost associated sites (e.g. drains, counters, soils). In all, 4950 samples were taken from 1560 unique sites. Samples were swabbed onto Pseudomonas Isolation Agar and incubated for 48 hours at 28\u00b0 C. Where growth occurred, the isolates were identified by their 16s rDNA sequence. In all, we isolated 72 P. aeruginosa from 47 of the 1560 unique sites. Patterns of recovery show that habitats differed significantly in recovery rates of P. aeruginosa. As expected, P. aeruginosa was recovered from the respiratory tracts of CF patients. It was also commonly found in household drains; 30% of the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, tub and shower drains sampled yielded P. aeruginosa. In contrast, it was rarely recovered from the other non-host associated sites including yard, garden, and houseplant soils; only 1.3% of these other non-host associated sites yielded P. aeruginosa. There were no differences in recovery from non-CF humans living in homes with versus without a CF patient, and non-host associated sites did not differ in P. aeruginosa recovery in CF homes versus non-CF homes. The fact that recovery of P. aeruginosa from drains in non-CF homes was not significantly lower than in CF homes suggests that colonization of the drains from patient sources does not explain the high rates of recovery from this habitat type. These data suggest that targeted cleaning of drains could substantially reduce P. aeruginosa populations to which CF patients are exposed in the home. Multiple in vitro studies have demonstrated the potential for an antibiotic to inhibit rather than synergize with the antimicrobial effects of other antibiotics. Azithromycin has been identified as a drug which may interfere with the effect of antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a.). Azithromycin is commonly prescribed as chronic therapy for patients with cystic fibrosis, due to broad immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties. The majority of these patients also receive episodic treatment with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and tobramycin. We sought to determine the interaction of azithromycin with these two anti-pseudomonal antibiotics in a model of persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in vivo.",

CF patients have chronic symptoms and radiologic findings that overlap with NTM infection making the differentiation between disease and colonization challenging.

            "text": "Conclusion: These data suggest that azithromycin is a primary prophylaxis for NTM disease and is not associated with resistance of NTM to macrolides. Prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings. Previously we have shown that macrolide and clindamycin resistance in members of the Streptococcus milleri Group (SMG), consisting of S. intermedius, S. constellatus, and S. anginosus, is markedly high among isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, particularly those on chronic azithromycin therapy (Grinwis et al. 2010. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 54:2823-2829). Typically, macrolide resistance in streptococci is due to the macrolide efflux pump, mefA/E, or the erythromycin methyltransferases ermA and ermB, although mutations in ribosomal DNA or proteins have also been observed, albeit at much lower frequencies. The purpose of the current study was to determine the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance prevalent among CF airway isolates of the SMG. A total of 67 CF airway isolates resistant to macrolides, clindamycin, or tetracycline were subject to PCR using primers specific for known resistance determinants. These included mefA/E, ermB, ermTR/A, universal primers for a conserved region in the 23S rDNA gene, and the tetracycline-resistance gene tetM. Thirty-three isolates were considered duplicates and omitted from the analysis, leaving 34 unique isolates from 26 patients. Of these, 31 were resistant to at least one of the two macrolides tested, erythromycin and azithromycin. Sixteen of the macrolide-resistant isolates (52%) harboured either ermB (11/16), ermTR/A (4/16) or mefA/E (1/16). All of the isolates harbouring ermTR/A had inducible clindamycin resistance, while all but one isolate harbouring ermB were constitutively resistant to clindamycin. The remaining 15 macrolideresistant isolates (48%) had a point mutation at position A2058 or A2059 in the 23S rDNA gene. A2058G was the most common mutation observed (11/15), although A2058T (2/15) and A2059G (2/15) were also observed. Both A2058G and A2059G mutations conferred resistance to clindamycin, while isolates harbouring A2058T mutations were susceptible to clindamycin. Interestingly, macrolide resistance in all S. constellatus isolates (n = 6) was solely due to ribosomal mutations. These findings suggest that ribosomal mutation is a more common mechanism of macrolide and clindamycin resistance in SMG isolates than previously thought. The prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has increased dramatically in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) over the last decade. This is concerning due to the possible association between persistent MRSA colonization in patients with CF and an increased rate of FEV 1 decline per year when compared with methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) colonization. The purpose of this study was to characterize current practices regarding efficacy and safety outcomes of long-term linezolid use in patients with CF, as this is not well described in the current literature.",

Following initial EO screening experiments, this study tested selected EOs and EO constituents, those found to be the most effective oils against individual isolates of opportunistic CF pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA), on mixed species cultures from polymicrobial CF sputum and throat specimens. Using disk diffusion and vapor exposure assays, the oils cassia, oregano, and thyme white in particular, inhibited the broad range of bacteria and yeast common to these specimens; zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranges: cassia, 13-20 mm; oregano, 20-34 mm; and thyme white, 22-31 mm. For some of the patient samples it was also observed that ZOIs in the mixed cultures were greater than ZOIs of isolates cultured independently. Focused on PA, studies of potential synergy between vapor phase EO exposure in combination with common antibiotics on disks was evaluated. As seen with bay laurel for example, for organisms already susceptible to antibiotics ceftazidime and pipericillin, demonstrated little to no synergistic effect (< 2mm difference), whereas for an isolate showing less sensitivity to tobramycin (11.5 mm ZOI ABX alone), the ZOI was larger when simultaneously exposed to EO bay laurel (16.5 mm). Overall, oregano, thyme, cassia and bay ranked the \"top performers\" as potential antimicrobial EOs, and carvacrol, thymol, and cinnamaldehyde as antimicrobial components, based on number and variety of strains inhibited in contact and vapor exposure assays. These data suggest the potential of essential oils and essential oil (EO)-derived compounds to provide additive antimicrobial activity toward co-colonizing pathogens in a way amenable to CF inhalation therapy. This research was supported by corporate and private sponsors and the University of Missouri Agriculture Experiment Station Chemical Laboratories.",

Lack of association of non-mucoid P. aeruginosa and early childhood lung function may reflect the widespread use of eradication protocols. Association of lower lung function with a wide variety of organisms suggests that the underlying pulmonary milieu (e.g. inflammation, mucociliary clearance) has a stronger influence on pulmonary outcomes than particular infectious organisms. Further study is needed to evaluate the impact of early childhood events on long-term pulmonary outcomes in CF. Support: CFF PITTMA10A0. (BX) is an early and prominent feature of CF lung disease. BX is present on chest CT even in children with normal PFTs, and chest CT scans can demonstrate progressive disease even when PFTs remain stable.

Subjects were enrolled if they were clinically stable, had not undergone solid organ transplantation, and were chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa. Subjects were excluded if they were infected with B. cepacia complex, receiving active treatment for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or diagnosed with ABPA. The early intervention arm performed home spirometry using the PiKo-6 spirometer and CFRSD assessment via web based questionnaire or Philips Telehealth twice weekly. If the respiratory symptoms noted the change in symptoms by a score of 2 or more or the subject's home spirometry result decreased by 10% or more, they were contacted by phone and evaluated about a possible acute exacerbation.

In response to chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and persistent pulmonary inflammation, there is an abnormal enlargement, proliferation and anastomosis of the bronchial vascular bed in patients with CF. Over a 5 year period, approximately 10% of people with CF will have hemoptysis with slightly less than half of this number experiencing massive hemoptysis during their lifetime. The source of massive hemoptysis is bronchial circulation in 90%. Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) has long been considered a safe effective nonsurgical modality to manage recurrent hemoptysis. Recently, an expert panel published consensus recommendations for treatment of hemoptysis in CF.

We stratified ESCF sites into quartiles based on 2004 data for mean FEV1, mean BMI, and mean Treatment Burden score (higher score signifying lower treatment burden) on the CF Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) (teen/adult, child, and parent versions) and compared mean TCS between highest and lowest quartile sites for each outcome.",

Such increases in treatment complexity pose a challenge to patient selfmanagement and adherence. No differences were seen in average treatment complexity at the site level based on average lung function or nutritional status, suggesting less variation in prescribing patterns despite variation between sites in patient outcomes. In contrast, treatment complexity was lower in sites with lower perceived treatment burden. Further research is needed to understand the associations between treatment complexity and subsequent health outcomes to reduce treatment burden and improve disease management.",

There was no associated audio. The RCS provided a choice of color incentive screens: A brick wall, sail boat, 3 little pigs' houses, or 16 candles.

Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA; 2. Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA; 3. University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; 4. ICON Clinical Research, San Francisco, CA, USA Reduction in pulmonary exacerbations is an important efficacy endpoint for CF clinical trials. Powering exacerbation endpoints requires estimation of the future exacerbation incidence in CF study populations, but rates may vary markedly with age and severity. Our objective was to estimate exacerbation rates for patients followed in the Epidemiologic Study of CF (ESCF) stratified by age, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) % predicted, sex, weight-for-age (WFA), respiratory signs and symptoms, and history of exacerbation and respiratory tract culture. To be included in this analysis, patients had to be clinically stable at a routine clinic visit (index visit) in which pulmonary function testing was performed within \u00b1 7 days and no treatment for exacerbation had been administered within \u00b1 14 days. In addition, patients had to have been enrolled in ESCF for at least 12 months before the index visit (baseline period) with at least 1 routine encounter within that period, and to have had at least 4 encounters spaced roughly quarterly (\u00b1 45 days) within a 13.5-month follow-up period after the index visit. Patients could be included more than once in the analysis if subsequent index visits did not occur during a follow-up period from a previous analysis. Patients with missing data on ESCF enrollment date, date of birth, or sex were excluded from the analysis. Key outcomes of interest were exacerbations treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and with \"any\" antibiotic (new oral quinolone, new inhaled antibiotic, or IV antibiotic). Percentages of patients treated for exacerbation within 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of their index visit and median time to treatment (if <365 days) were calculated for different subgroups. Sample sizes required to attain 80% power to detect 20% to 80% reduction in treatment for exacerbation in 1:1 randomized studies of 3 to 12 months duration were determined. A total of 39,326 unique analysis periods were captured among 16,082 eligible ESCF patients; 10,018 patients contributed at least twice to analyses. Only 34.1% of patients were treated with IV antibiotics during follow-up. Median time to receive \"any\" treatment was 294 days; 55.0% were treated at least once during follow-up. Incidence of treatment consistently increased in all age groups as lung function decreased; treatment incidence generally increased with age group regardless of lung function up to 24 yr, beyond which it declined slightly. Female sex, history of exacerbation, WFA <25 th percentile, and history of Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture were associated with increased IV and \"any\" antibiotic treatment regardless of lung function. Patients with daily cough, daily sputum, clubbing, and crackles were treated with IV and \"any\" antibiotics at higher incidence than the entire population regardless of lung function; the effect of wheeze was variable. Observed differences in the incidence of treatment for exacerbation between patient subgroups may help inform the design and powering of future CF clinical trials with exacerbation endpoints. Background: Nebulized 7% hypertonic saline has recently been incorporated as a new therapeutic agent that helps restore airway surface liquid in patients with cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to determine the aerosol characteristics of a commercially available formulation of 7% hypertonic saline when delivered by 4 different nebulizers.",

There is increasing complexity of disease as patients survive into middle age. Background: Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in cystic fibrosis patients with end-stage lung disease is often used as a bridge to lung transplantation. Patients with advanced pulmonary disease have increased work of breath, which contributes to high metabolic demands. In CF patients with low BMI, the high metabolic needs of breathing may hinder efforts to gain weight. There is limited data regarding the use of NIPPV to assist in airway clearance and for overnight ventilatory support; no data exist regarding the use of NIPPV to decrease work of breathing and augment nutritional support.",

Ventilation was provided using Trilogy 100 ventilator with bilevel pressure ventilatory support to achieve target goal tidal volume of 8cc/kg. Data was downloaded from the machines monthly to assess patient use as well as pressures and volumes delivered by the ventilator. Data was collected from five patients with initial mean FEV1 of 0.96L (27% predicted), FVC of 2.03L (49 % predicted), serum bicarbonate of 29.6mmol/L, BMI of 19.2. While compliance varied from patient to patient, in those patients who had been on NIPPV for greater than 12 months, the mean percent days of ventilator use was 82.5%, average hours of ventilator use was 6.5 hours, and the average hours of ventilator use on days actually used was 7.8 hours. In these five patients during this period, there was no change in lung function or BMI; one patient died and one patient successfully underwent lung transplantation.",

Based on our data, NIPPV appears to be well tolerated with good patient compliance and may provide a model for objectively measuring compliance in cystic fibrosis. Downloaded data from ventilators may also allow for remote monitoring of disease in cystic fibrosis. Our data does not allow any conclusions about efficacy of NIPPV on nutritional outcomes. A larger study will be needed to examine the effects of NIPPV on oxygen consumption/metabolic rate as well as the appropriate timing of initiation of NIPPV to augment nutritional support.",

Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland Background: Tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) is a new drug-device combination delivering light-porous-particles via the portable T-326 dry powder inhaler, designed to reduce treatment times and improve ease of use in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection. The recent EAGER trial compared the safety, efficacy and convenience of TIP vs tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) in CF patients aged \u22656 years. Here we report the post-hoc subgroup analysis by age. Previously, the most robust response to TIS was shown in 13-17 year olds (Ramsey 1999).",

Possible confounding variables may include elements of standard therapy that achieve similar therapeutic results as OMT and using set amount of time for individual OMT treatments rather than completing treatments when tissue texture changes are appreciated. A larger sample size may be necessary to detect differences between OMT and sham groups. The clinically significant actions of oral azithromycin in modifying progressive CF lung disease have been well documented. In vitro and clinical data suggests that clarithromycin has immunomodulatory properties similar to other 14-member macrolides, however 2 previously reported short term trials of clarithromycin in small numbers of patients with CF failed to show significant benefits in modifying lung function or inflammation. We performed a trial in 63 subjects with CF who received either placeo or 500 mg oral clarithromycin twice daily for 5 months, with a one month wash-out. Patients were enrolled from Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC and CF centers at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth and the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. The study was a double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo controlled trial in subjects with a proven diagnosis of CF defined as clinical symptoms plus presence of 2 recognized CF gene mutations and/or a positive sweat test. Subjects were excluded if FEV1 was < 30% predicted at enrollment, had ever had Mycobacterium in a sputum culture, or had a respiratory exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics in the 60 days before enrollment. Other exclusion criteria were the presence of any significant (> 30 mL) haemoptysis in the preceding year, requirement for oxygen therapy, or the presence of any significant liver or renal disease. Subjects allergic to or intolerant of macrolides, or who were taking medications that adversely interact with macrolide were not enrolled. The primary efficacy end point was the change in lung function during the clarithromycin treatment period compared to placebo treatment. Secondary efficacy end points included; quality of life, number of pulmonary exacerbations, height and weight, sputum inflammatory mediator content, sputum transportability and surface properties, bacterial flora, nasal potential difference, and breath condensate. Mean age at entry was 16.7 \u00b111.0 years (mean \u00b1 S.D). There were 40 males and 23 females. Mean FEV1 and FVC at entry was 75.3% \u00b1 22.8 % predicted and 87.9 \u00b1 20.1 % predicted. Twenty-six subjects were taking dornase alfa at entry. Fifty-two subjects successfully completed the 11 month trial. There was no significant change from baseline of FEV1 or FVC over the 5 month period for the 2 treatment groups of the trial. Similarly there was no significant difference in the changes observed over the 5 month trial while subjects were taking clarithromycin compared to placebo. During treatment with clarithromycin, FEV1 rose 0.9% \u00b1 9.8% predicted compared to a rise of 1.4% \u00b1 8.4% predicted while taking placebo. No significant difference in any secondary end point was seen during the period of clarithromycin treat-ment compared to those seen during placebo administration. We conclude that clarithromycin is not effective in treating CF lung disease. Lebanon, NH, USA; 2. Intrinsic LifeSciences, LLC, La Jolla, CA, USA; 3. Earth Sciences, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, USA; 4. Physiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA; 5. Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA Background: Sputum iron content is higher in CF than in normal health. In a cross-sectional study of two adult CF cohorts, we found that subjects with higher sputum iron levels also demonstrated worse lung function, lower hemoglobin and blood iron levels, and higher blood levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). We noted a significant inverse correlation between iron and IL-6 in blood. IL-6 stimulates hepatic production of hepcidin-25, a peptide that causes hypoferremia by decreasing enteral iron absorption and promoting iron sequestration in reticuloendothelial cells. Knowing that IL-6 mediates hypoferremia through hepcidin-25 and that blood iron and IL-6 are related, we suspected that relative hypoferremia is a feature of CF pulmonary exacerbation (CFPE). We hypothesized that levels of iron would increase and levels of IL-6 and hepcidin-25 would fall in the blood after treatment for CFPE.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Based on changes in serum iron, IL-6, and hepcidin-25, hypoferremia caused by inflammation is a feature of CFPE. Although serum and sputum iron levels trend in opposite directions during CFPE, blood concentrations do not predict levels in airway secretions. Close associations between serum iron and body weight, and between serum iron and lung function suggest that recovery from hypoferremia reflects treatment success. Rationale: Telephone-based triage and treatments are key tools at any CF center that services a large geographic area. The Doernbecher/OHSU CF center provides care to 220 pediatric patients in a 100,000 sq mile area covering Oregon and southern Washington. As part of our efforts to better understand telephone initiated care at OHSU, we employed the Akron Children's Pulmonary Exacerbation Score (PES) for telephone calls about CF patient lung symptoms. The telephone PES lacks objective data (e.g. PFT), but retains systemic signs including fever, fatigue, appetite, cough, missed school or work. Pulmonary signs include change in chest congestion or cough \u2265 1 week, dyspnea, and/or hemoptysis, into a weighted score from 0 -16. A combined score of 3 or more, including at least one from the pulmonary domain, suggests CF pulmonary exacerbation.",

Using a 2 x 2 table, we calculated the positive likelihood ratio for a PES of 3 or more at 25.7 (CI 5.3 -139.8) for being treated as an exacerbation by the physician. For initial encounters where the PES was 3 or greater (n=55), 52 patients received oral ATB and were advised to increase airway clearance, 9 were also seen in the next available clinic, 3 were admitted to the hospital directly, and 2 refused to be seen. Physician response to the addition of the PES score was favorable. While we lack specific data for ATB prescription rate prior to PES scoring, we perceived an overall reduction in ATB use during the scoring period.

Medical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Erasmus MC/ Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 4. Psychology and Pediatrics, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by progressive bronchiectasis (BE) and trapped air (TA). Currently, FEV1 is used as primary end point in clinical trials. However, FEV1 has poor accuracy and sensitivity to detect and monitor BE and TA. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) is the gold standard to detect BE, but radiation exposure and costs limit its use. Chest Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been suggested as a radiation free alternative for CT. For this reason we aim to validate MRI as an endpoint in clinical trials. In previous studies we showed that MRI overestimates lung abnormalities in early disease and underestimates the severity in late stage lung disease. In addition we showed a correlation between BE score from CT and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), measured by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). Based on the reduced sensitivity of MRI relative to CT we hypothesize that BE on MRI would not correlate to CFQ-R.",

Patients initially consented to participate in the study but only CF patients who subsequently were prescribed TIS and notified HealthCore prior to using TIS between August 2009 and February 2010 were eligible to complete the surveys. Surveys were administered at three time points over a one month period: just prior to starting TIS treatment, 2 weeks on TIS treatment, and 4 weeks on TIS treatment. The CFQ-R for Parents/Caregivers (children 6 to 13 years) and Adolescents and Adults (14 years or order) was used as the major instrument to determine CF patients' quality of life with sub-scales relating to disease-related symptoms, school, work, or daily activities and overall health perceptions. Raw sub-scale scores were transformed to standard scores ranging from 0 to 100.

In a study of first-time spirometric tests in children 3-5 years of age, nearly 60% of patients produced reproducible forced vital capacity (FVC), but only 32% performed reproducible sets of FEV1 [1]. It is important to know how reliable the first PFT is as FEV1 percent predicted is used in every day clinical practice, to predict decline in health, survival and is the primary outcome parameter in clinical studies of new therapeutics in CF. To address this issue we undertook a retrospective study to assess reliability of first PFT in the CF population.",

Pediatric Pneumology, CF Center, Verona, Italy Purpose: CF leads to early and chronic lung structural changes. CT is the most sensitive technique for CF follow-up, and the most relevant information obtained is about bronchiectasis (BE) and air-trapping (AT). Unfortunately CT exposes patients to radiation and its use is restricted to 1 scan every 2 years. MRI is an attractive alternative to CT, but it has poorer spatial resolution for BE and AT. Hypo-Perfusion (HP) is an even more relevant finding than AT since it identifies areas that do not contribute to gas diffusion. Therefore we decided to: 1) compare the distribution/volume of HP defects on CEMRI to the AT on the MRI; and 2) compare distribution/volume of HP defects and AT to PFTs of small airway disease: FEF25, FEF75 and FEV/FVC ratio.",

Introduction: Progressive airways obstruction is a key feature of cystic fibrosis (CF) which has its origins in the small airways. More sensitive measures of lung function are needed in CF with reduced forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV 1 ) decline per annum. Inert gas washouts can be time consuming for CF patients and would be difficult to fit into routine assessment in the clinic. Impulse oscillometry (IOS) offers a quick and easy way to perform assessment of small airway function. As yet there is little research in this area within CF. Reactance at 5Hz (X 5 ), measured by IOS determines the capacitive properties of the peripheral lung. Studies so far in CF have used whole breath analysis only. Within breath analysis can separate X rs into its mean inspiratory and mean expiratory components.",

By performing within breath analysis of IOS, expiratory reactance at 5Hz was shown to correlate better with gas trapping and hence may be a better indicator of small airway function.

In addition IOS requires little training to use, takes only a couple of minutes to perform and could be easily incorporated into clinical practice. progressed. Evidence suggests that earlier treatment of exacerbations is associated with improved health outcomes. We are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial (Early Intervention in Cystic Fibrosis Exacerbation (eICE)) comparing usual care to home monitoring of lung function and symptoms to trigger early treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. Our pilot study has shown that home monitoring can identify pulmonary exacerbations 15 days before patients typically report illness to their physician. Furthermore, the time to identification of the first exacerbation is reduced in the intervention arm (26 vs. 45 days, p=0.03). Lastly, adherence with home monitoring is high (>95%).",

High-dose aminoglycosides are a mainstay of treatment for exacerbations in this population. We examined a single-center outpatient population of adults with cystic fibrosis for hearing loss. Patients who presented to the clinic for routine follow up were evaluated for perceived hearing loss using a screening version of the hearing handicap inventory questionnaire modified for cystic fibrosis patients. A total of 155 patients were screened. Patients with scores of 8 or higher on the screening inventory had at least a 13% probability of having measurable hearing loss and were referred for formal audiology evaluation. Fifteen patients in our population screened positive on the questionnaire and were referred for audiologic evaluation. Nine patients completed audiologic evaluations and eight had at least slight hearing loss. The prevalence of hearing loss in this high-risk population is 5-9%. There does not appear a correlation between severity of hearing loss and frequency of exacerbations, patient age or cumulative aminoglycoside dose. Our findings suggest that patients with cystic fibrosis who have had repeated courses of high-dose aminoglycosides have rates of measurable hearing loss similar to published rates of aminoglycoside-related ototoxicity in the general population. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening questionnaire was not evaluated in this study; validation of this screening tool may offer a simple, readily available and easy-to-administer ancillary test to routine audiometric monitoring of patients with cystic fibrosis.

However, they continue to have a leading role in the treatment of certain infections and in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Because there are no current guidelines for monitoring vestibular function, and since we are interested in determining whether some portions of the test battery are more sensitive to change with repeated exposure, we have obtained serial testing data on 30 patients to assess for both clinical as well as subclinical changes. While almost half of the patients showed significant enough changes to move them from one clinical category to another (normal to nonlateralized vestibular system involvement or unilateral loss, non-lateralized vestibular system involvement to unilateral or bilateral loss, and unilateral to bilateral loss), each of the patients who had bilateral vestibular loss remained in that category, although some demonstrated increased severity of the loss.

Our findings demonstrated poor correlation with subjective and clinical occurrences frequently used to gauge severity of respiratory disease in this population.

While this study does have significant limitations it does support the clinical utility of infant pulmonary function testing in screening for lung disease while raising significant questions about the specificity of parental observations and clinical assessment in detecting respiratory disease in infants with CF. Background: On a pediatric pulmonary inpatient unit, of a large Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Center, the unit's Quality and Safety Committee observed inconsistencies with the timing of the blood draws for aminoglycosides and vancomycin levels in children admitted for a pulmonary exacerbation. We hypothesized that improving the consistency in drawing blood levels would lead to more accurate laboratory values and improve the ability of the healthcare providers to determine appropriate antibiotic dosing for each patient.",

Specifically, it was discovered that inadequate flush volumes were being used which resulted in incomplete administration of the antibiotics. In addition, the implementation of the drug level communication form improved reporting between nurses and the pharmacist. As a result of this project, new hospital guidelines for administering and obtaining aminoglycosides and vancomycin levels are being adopted. Aerosolized tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) may be absorbed and result in measurable serum levels. This could affect calculation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and dosing if TIS is used concurrently with intravenous (IV) tobramycin for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation. Computer PK modeling predicts that TIS given in the latter portion of the IV dosing interval would result in increased tobramycin trough levels in some patients. We wanted to assess the significance of timing of TIS on IV tobramycin trough levels in the clinical setting.",

It aims to detect departure from the condition's baseline, establish the response to treatment and detect the need to adjust treatment. Statistical process control (SPC) charts have been used in asthma management and provide a patient-specific, statistically meaningful method of evaluating effectiveness of medications and interventions.

The RCC was performed by a group of respiratory therapists (RTs) in both the out-patient (OP) and in-patient (IP) settings. The RTs underwent training to ensure that patient education was consistent. OPs were randomly selected during routine clinic appointments. The IPs were recruited during their hospital stay. Utility of the RCC was assessed by open ended questions asking what part of the RCC was most helpful and if it would change respiratory care practices at home. The time taken to complete an RCC ranged from 30 to 90 minutes, depending on the needs of the patient.",

A significant number of families were performing therapies improperly and inconsistently and none of the families was doing everything correctly. The knowledge our patients and families gained by the RCC is expected to change their behavior at home and may improve outcomes. Periodic reassessment is critical in maintaining overall lung health. Future directions will include FEV1 measurements over time and re-assessment of each patient at least once a year and more often as needed. Background: The benefits of exercise in CF on improving exercise capacity and stabilising lung function, as well as survival are known. A previous study of supervised out-patient exercise and physiotherapy in CF reported a 48% reduction in intravenous antibiotic (ivAB) need, as well as modest improvements in lung function and exercise capacity. 1 We sought to evaluate the effects of such a programme in a second, novel population.",

Lung function measures monitor disease progress in CF but only measure one aspect of disease. Exercise testing allows further evaluation of a patient's function. The gold standard in exercise testing is laboratory based, usually on a treadmill or cycle ergometer, using sophisticated measuring tools e.g. expired gas analysis. Laboratory based testing is not always available or feasible to be repeated regularly. Consequently, field-based exercise tests have been developed for routine clinical assessment as they require minimal equipment or space to perform. The aim of this review was to identify and report on field exercise tests which have been assessed for reliability and validity in the CF population.",

Requirements for each test differ in time taken, equipment and space requirements. Clinical utilization of a test should consider: test reliability and validity, requirements of the test but most of all the demands of the test on the patient and the patient's clinical status to meet such demands. Astute use of an exercise test for a patient requires the clinician to be conversant with all available exercise tests. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease leads to progressive declines in lung function and exercise tolerance. Pulmonary exacerbations are the leading cause of morbidity among CF patients, but how pulmonary exacerbations affect exercise tolerance remains unclear. Because regular exercise has the potential to improve pulmonary function, developing routine exercise programs may be beneficial for CF patients, even during hospitalization. Therefore, using a validated exercise test, we investigated exercise tolerance and lung function in children with CF hospitalized for pulmonary exacerbations.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Inpatients undergoing treatment for pulmonary exacerbations reported severe breathlessness and moderate exertion following exercise using the modified Borg scales. These results demonstrate that during a pulmonary exacerbation, patients are limited by dyspnea and those with lower lung function have lower exercise tolerance. Both exercise tolerance and lung function improve after treatment for pulmonary exacerbation. These findings show that the MSWT is a useful measure of improvement in the hospital and should be used in conjunction with regular exercise as part of inpatient airway clearance therapy. Introduction: Adults with CF develop increased work of breathing (WOB) from progressive pulmonary impairment that impacts the inspiratory muscles. An imbalance between the WOB and inspiratory muscle function (IMF) contributes to inefficient ventilation, dyspnea, and impaired exercise capacity. In COPD, inspiratory muscle training (IMT) increases IMF, decreases dyspnea, and improves functional capacity. Research evaluating IMT in CF is extremely limited. Given the time commitments of CF care, the clinical benefit of new interventions such as IMT should be determined before being added. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a homebased IMT program to determine its potential efficacy in adults with CF.",

We concluded that IV antibiotic therapy has positive effects on PA in CF. However, an activity level of moderate exercise from 3.0 to 6.0 METS of at least 30 to 60 min is recommended for individuals aged 18-64 years to achieve health benefits. For additional health benefits adults should increase their moderate intensity aerobic physical exercise to 300 min or should exercise in vigorous intensity aerobic physical exercise of 150 min per week (6.0 to 9.0 METS). Our participants achieved the lower limit of these recommendations. It is of great importance to motivate subjects with CF to improve PA in daily life as well as to participate in sports or planned exercise. Therefore, CF Care Centers should offer an individual \"exercise support\" to children, adolescents, adults with CF and their parents and partners. There is evidence a dedicated outpatient physiotherapy service can significantly improve admission days, lung function and aerobic fitness 1 . The service involved sessions every 1 to 3 weeks, over 12 months for CF patients with 4 or more admissions. Objective: To determine the effects of a 12 month intensive ambulatory physiotherapy service (APS) on the number of admissions and occupied bed days for pulmonary exacerbations, lung function, aerobic fitness, and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Patient satisfaction of the APS was also examined. Method: Patients with 3 or more admissions in 2010 (n=21) were recruited from the total CF population (n=153) at the WCH. They were offered the 12 month APS in 2011 which involved outpatient sessions every 1 to 3 weeks consisting of airway clearance regimes, nebulised osmolytic agents, aerobic and anaerobic exercise, education and self management support. Outcome measures included number of admissions and occupied bed days, percentage of predicted FEV1, Modified Shuttle Walk Test (MSWT) distance, maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) calculated from MSWT 2 , Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised (CFQ-R) and a patient satisfaction survey comprised of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) and a modified Concise Outpatient Department User Satisfaction Scale (CODUSS). Results: Nine patients (8 females) accepted and commenced the APS in January 2011, with a mean age of 9.5 \u00b1 3.9. One patient did not participate in spirometry or the MSWT due to age. See results table. Conclusion: Based on six months findings, the APS may result in a significant reduction in admissions and occupied bed days. The APS also has high patient satisfaction.

Faculdade de Fisioterapia, UNIFRA, Santa Maria, Brazil The deterioration of lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients can lead to increased work of breathing causing muscle imbalance, due to the altered mechanics of respiration, and postural deformities. However, few studies have been published evaluating postural alterations and its relation to lung function in CF patients. Thus, the objective of present study was to correlate baropodometric, postural evaluation and lung function in children and adolescents with CF. For that, we performed a cross-sectional study, evaluating twenty-three children and adolescents with CF followed at the outpatient CF clinic of Hospital S\u00e3o Lucas -Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul. Firstly, anthropometric (height, weight and body mass index) and lung function (spirometry) evaluations were performed. Then, all patients were submitted to a postural evaluation using digital photos, after specific anatomical points were marked, in four different angles (anterior, posterior, left and right). The postural analysis was performed using the SAPO software. Static and dynamic baropodometric evaluations were also conducted in order to measure plantar pressures and anterior/lateral pressures displacement using the Footwork software. All data were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Correlation analysis was performed using the Pearson's correlation test (significance accepted when p\u22640.05). Results have shown a mean age (years) of 13.3\u00b13.4, height (cm) of 152.3\u00b113.8, weight (kg) of 45.6\u00b113.5 and body mass index of 19.3\u00b12.9. Lung function test demonstrated a mean FVC (%) of 109.9\u00b120.1 and FEV1 (%) of 95.0\u00b121.0. Postural evaluation (degrees) has shown a head asymmetry of 48.6\u00b15.4 and a vertical acromion-head misalignment of 13.1\u00b17.4. Baropodometric analysis demonstrated a mean anterior pressure dislocation of 11.8\u00b17.0% and a lateral pressure dislocation of 4.6\u00b14.5%. There were significant negative correlations of both FVC and FEV1 with the horizontal pelvic angle (r=-0.53;p=0.01 and r=-0.51;p=0.01), knee angle (r=-0.55;p=0.009 and r=-0.56;p=0.009) and ankle angle (r=-0.57;p=0.007 and r=-0.53;p=0.01), respectively, but no significant correlations with head or shoulders. There were also significant correlations of the pelvic alignment with the anterior/posterior pressure dislocation (r=0.43;p=0.03) and of the shoulder and spine with the lateral pressure dislocation (r=0.41;p=0.04 and r=0.40;p=0.05), respectively. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the presence of postural alterations that do not seem to strongly correlate with lung function. Baropodometry could be used as an adjunct to postural evaluation in CF patients, although its isolated role remains uncertain.",

Monitoring physical activity should be a primary goal in CF care. Taillon Background: The recruitment patterns of the deep and superficial abdominal muscles during static short duration activities such as abdominal hollowing have been documented in the general population, and recently, in adults with stable symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF). These patterns were found to be similar in individuals with CF when compared to healthy controls. Because of the repetitive use of the abdominal muscles for coughing in CF, the capacity to produce a sustained contraction of these muscles, such as during yoga and Pilates, may be altered as compared to a non-coughing control group.",

Most notably, ambulatory VV ECMO optimized patient suitability for emergent lung transplantation in this small cohort with each patient receiving both physical therapy and oral nutrition without the need for sedation and paralytics, which is often required with standard respiratory support with mechanical ventilation. Introduction: Chronic aspiration is a significant problem in advanced lung disease due to cystic fibrosis (CF). The clinical impact of aspiration continues after lung transplantation in CF patients and is considered a risk factor for the development of allograft rejection, thus Nissen fundoplication (NF) is routinely done for preventative measures. There is no biomarker available to assess aspiration in lung transplant recipients, so we hypothesize that the lipid-laden macrophage (LLM) index may be useful in objectively assessing the results of NF in CF patients.",

The majority of patients were transplanted for cystic fibrosis (68%). Only 52% of patients reported that their health care provider had discussed future pregnancy with them prior to their transplant. Sixteen percent responded that they learned that \"pregnancy is undesirable but normal pregnancies can and do occur.\" Sixty-one percent knew that pregnancy is not advised after transplant but only 39% recognized that pregnancy can result in loss of lung function in the transplant graft. The majority of patients (77%) indicated that they were not self-conscious about their surgical scars; however, the respondents noted multiple other changes in their appearance that they attributed to post-transplant medications, such as acne (22%), alopecia (33%), hypertrichosis (37%), weight loss (19%) and weight gain (37%). Twenty-two percent admitted to loss of libido, with 30% indicating that they were not able to maintain a healthy sexual life with their partners. Mental health was also a major concern among the respondents to the survey. Fifty-eight percent of respondents admitted to being anxious or depressed following their transplantation; 30% of respondents were worried that they were a \"burden\" to their family members since their transplant. Overall, 94% of respondents indicated that despite complications, they felt their health was better than it had been prior to their transplant. In the words of one recipient, \"I feel I have traded one disease for another, and sometimes the cost outweighs the benefit and vice versa. However, I know I wouldn't do it any differently given the chance to do it again.\" Many respondents indicated that they \"love to breathe\" and thanked the investigators for \"asking the questions that no one else seems to care about.\"",

More slow and progressive lung damage could explain this finding. Decline in the rate of PA colonized patients is especially seen since 2003. This common pathogen in CF is known to develop rapid decline in lung function and severe lung disease. The use of new anti-Pseudomonas inhaled antibiotics such as high dose tobramycin (Tobi\u00ae), colistin and the systematic use of azithromycin have probably led to a slower progression of lung damage in PA colonized patients. Another explanation could be the use of more accurate identification techniques enabling better differentiation between PA and other gram-negative bacteria. 'New emerging pathogens' such as Stenotrophomonas, Achromobacter species and other gram-negatives were probably previously mis-identified as PA. This shift in nomenclature could contribute to a global decrease in PA colonized CF patients, but further studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.",

This study aimed -using a linked newborn screening-live birth-death file for which archived newborn dried blood spots were available -to understand how many infants and young children died from CF in California during a time when NBS for CF was not available. The cases were comprised of all deaths (N=2428) to children before 30 months of age (without regard to cause or any other factors listed on the death certificate) born between 01/07/2002 and 06/13/2003 (18 month period) (Cohort size=810,452). To identify CF cases, dried blood spot specimens were first analyzed for immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) by PerkinElmer using the AutoDelfia\u00ae IRT assay. CF mutation testing was conducted at CDC using the Asuragen Signature\u00ae CF 2.0 ASR assay which was customized to include 54 CFTR mutations, including those specially designed for the California CF NBS program, DNA sequencing of all CFTR exons, intron borders and 5' and 3' regions, and large deletion/insertion analysis using the MRC Holland MLPA assay. Altogether, 345 (14.2%) of the death specimens had IRT values above the 95th percentile of the current CF screening program. CF genotyping revealed that none of the 345 screen positive deaths had two CFTR mutations and 24 had one mutation. None of the 2428 deaths were due to CF according to the death records. This study provides strong evidence that there were no deaths in the first 30 months of life to individuals with CF prior to the enactment of CF NBS in California in 2007. Background and Objective: CF patients are inconsistently treated with antibiotics (ABX) for signs and symptoms of pulmonary exacerbations (PE). A previous ESCF analysis (Johnson et al, Chest 2003; 123:20-7) showed that IV ABX were used more frequently at sites with better pulmonary function; however, it did not examine how ABX were prescribed. The CFF Benchmarking Project found that higher performing centers had lower thresholds for prescribing ABX in response to signs and symptoms of PE. Our aim was to determine if higher FEV 1 sites are distinguished by a greater likelihood of identifying signs and symptoms of PE and or by a greater likelihood of prescribing ABX in response to documented signs and symptoms of PE.",

However, infants with BW<1500 gms tend to have very high IRT's, and the 95 and 96 %ile for IRT in African Americans (AA) is about 30% higher than Caucasians. This upward shift in the population IRT distribution would be expected to impact on the specificity of an elevated IRT for these groups, and is of particular importance in the AA population given its lower incidence of CF. A reasonable response to the variability in IRT measurements might be the use of a floating IRT cutoff for the general population, but consideration should be given to the use of race and birth weight specific cutoffs as well.

Pediatrics, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA As a result of newborn screening programs, individuals have been identified as possibly having cystic fibrosis (CF) on the basis of two genetic mutations of the CFTR protein (located on two different chromosomes) but having a normal sweat chloride test. Retesting of these infants, who are assigned the diagnosis of CRMS, have been recommended at two and six months of age (J Peds 2009; 155:S106-16) . Because not all CFTR mutations are disease-causing, there continues to be uncertainty as to the natural history of these newborns. We have identified a family with delta I507 with poly T (TG)12-5T and (TG)10-7T mutations. The newborn had three normal sweat chloride determinations (24, 20, and 30 mMol/L at 2, 4, and 12 months of age). However, his two older siblings with the same mutations show positive values of 71 and 76 mMol/L at 42 and 63 months of age. We then looked at fifteen of our CRMS patients and examined their sweat chloride test results and ages. It appeared that there is a direct correlation between age and sweat Cl in patients with CRMS. On the other hand, patients with two mutations which are clearly associated with CFTR dysfunction (i.e., CF) will have positive sweat chlorides, even at two to four months of age. There was no correlation with the volume of sweat and the value of chloride in CRMS. In conclusion, close follow-up of CRMS patients identified by newborn screening with re-testing of their sweat chloride is recommended. Extrapolating the data on our CRMS patients, it would appear that continued sweat chloride testing, especially after 40 months of age, may be necessary. This was also indicated by our family described above. Pediatrics/Pulmonology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA; 2. Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA; 3. Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA; 4. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Bethesda, MD, USA Background: Since 2010, CF NBS has been available in all states in the USA. In addition to diagnosis of CF, NBS can also result in the diagnosis of CRMS: infants with a positive NBS but indeterminate CF diagnosis. Little is known about how NBS has affected diagnosis of CF and CRMS at CF Centers. The goal of this project was to assess the impact of CF NBS on diagnosis of CF and CRMS by using data from the CF Center annual renewal application.",

Department of Pediatrics, Feinberg School of Medicine Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA; 3. St. Alexius Medical Center, Hoffman Estates, IL, USA Background: Although newborn screening has resulted in increased sweat testing for infants, obtaining an adequate volume of sweat has remained a challenge. The national standard for individuals >3 months of age is a < 5% quantity not sufficient rate (QNS). Studies examining neonatal QNS rates at various centers show significant variability. It has been suggested that a goal of < 10% QNS be achieved for children \u2264 3 months of age. The Cystic Fibrosis Center of Chicago at St. Alexius Medical Center is one of Illinois' designated centers for newborn screening. After an initial period of testing, a quality improvement (QI) program for sweat testing was instituted to improve QNS rates at this center.",

Department of Pediatrics, St Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA Introduction: Malnutrition at the time of diagnosis with cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with a poorer prognosis. Despite universal newborn screening, many children with CF are still malnourished with the national median weight-for-length percentile for CF toddlers still below 50% by two years of age. We proposed that intensive education and improved nutritional education contributes to improved nutritional outcomes and aggressive nutritional education with close monitoring in the first 2 years of life is critical in maintaining adequate growth and preventing future respiratory compromise.",

Following CF infant care guidelines, our dietitian met with families and initiated our educational program that incorporates monthly meetings to provide nutritional support regarding pancreatic insufficiency, timing and dosing of pancreatic enzyme supplements and strategies to increase caloric intake. Heights, weights and head circumferences were obtained at each visit. Weight and weight-for-height z-scores are calculated at each visit. Treatment modification i.e. acid suppression and GE reflux assessment are performed based on clinical criteria. The outcomes were contrasted to previously reported data from our center obtained as part of a two-year quality improvement (QI) project that was part of the NICHQ \"Breakthrough Series\" (2002 -2003) .",

All were pancreatic insufficient. Our recent nutritional data was contrasted to weight-forage z-scores of children studied as part of our earlier QI project. Whereas those children had an improved weight-for-age z-score (-1.8 to -0.9) over the 12 month study period, our most recent data revealed less weight gain with infants demonstrating a weight-for-age z-score of only -1.4 at diagnosis, improving to only -0.88 \u00b1 0.38 at 1 year of age. Weight-for-height z-scores were somewhat better, increasing from -1.0 at diagnosis to 0.10 at 1 year of age, although 43.4% of our subjects still were at least one z-score below the 50% isopleth. Poor growth was not attributable to a delay in diagnosis with all infants having confirmatory sweat testing an average of 21.1 days postpartum. Clinical monitoring was sufficient; 75% of the infants were seen in recommended clinic follow-up visits during the first year following diagnosis.",

As well, we show that >40% of our children have weightfor-height z-scores that reveal growth failure. Our data supports our contention that despite early diagnosis and relatively frequent clinical followup, an even more aggressive management approach, possibly with additional behavior interventions, is needed to address the nutritional as well as respiratory health of young CF children.

Children's Memorial Research Center, Chicago, IL, USA; 4. University of Illinois, Springfield, IL, USA Background: States develop specific protocols for CF newborn screening (NBS). Diagnostic bias and health disparities may result depending on the ethnic and racial populations represented if testing is not tailored to the population served (1). Illinois initiated CF NBS using the IRT/DNA method in 2008. We hypothesized that mutation distribution and detection rates would differ between Hispanic and non-Hispanic CF patients diagnosed by NBS and that more Hispanic infants would carry mutations not detected by the NBS panel.",

Seven mutations (28%) were present in the Hispanic and African American patients but absent from non-Hispanic Caucasians. Ten mutations (36%) were present in only the non-Hispanic Caucasian patients. Among 104 newborns diagnosed with CF, mutations were identified in 92% of alleles. The case detection rate is 97% when 2 mutations are identified; this number drops to 0.3 % and 0.7% when 0 or 1 mutations are detected, respectively. More Hispanic infants with CF had one or more undefined mutations after screening, in comparison to non-Hispanic Caucasian patients (40% vs. 9.5%; p<0.002). The risk of having a positive diagnosis of CF with only one mutation on a positive newborn screen panel increases 2-fold in Hispanic Caucasian versus non-Hispanic Caucasian infants (5% vs. 2.4%).

Additionally, further work is needed to separate the effects of race from those of center-specific logistical barriers, because attention may need to be directed at identifying and eliminating barriers for black families to receive genetic counseling. Since then a total of 730,730 babies have been screened with 296 cases of CF identified; however, 325 cases of CF are known to the screening laboratory. Of the 29 cases missed on screening, 10 had meconium ileus (MI), 12 were pancreatic insufficient (PI) but without MI and 7 were pancreatic sufficient (PS). The age of diagnosis for the non-MI false negative cases ranged from 4 weeks to 14 years and included several patients homozygous for DF508. Six PI patients had an IRT within 5\u00b5g/l of the cut-off for the IRT screen, 3 of whom had an initial raised IRT with the second IRT being below the cut-off. The majority of patients had respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of diagnosis. False negative results occur frequently in CF babies with MI although the cause is unclear, possibly relating to surgery and/or lack of enteral feeding. Failure to detect some CF cases without MI reflected the IRT cut-off chosen, however in a small number the IRT was close to the neonatal population mean (both PI and PS).",

This is likely due to increased identification of milder cases with the NBS. Our practices for confirmatory sweat testing of positive CFNBS infants are in line with the current recommendations. Minimal wait times for confirmatory testing allows earlier identification of CF patients (<3 months old) than prior to the implementation of CFNBS (mean age 3.6 years old). This is expected to result in overall improved health and outcomes due to a delay of bacterial colonization and better nutrition earlier in the course of disease. McMahon, V.R.; Schellenberg, A.; Burgess, C.A.; Sinclair, G.; Vallance, H.; Chilvers, M.A. Provincial Newborn Screening Program, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada Background: In 2009, the province of British Columbia (BC) initiated CF newborn screening (NBS). BC extends over 950,000 km 2 and careful consideration was required in developing the NBS algorithm due to the widespread distribution of our population. IRT/DNA/IRT was chosen as inclusion of a second IRT significantly reduced the number of infants required to attend our centre for sweat testing.",

Considering only screened patients, at December 2000 the 20 year OS was 80%, at December 2010 it was 92%. Considering 5 yr birth cohorts, 20 year overall survival continuously improved: 77.8% in the cohort 1971-1975, 84.3% in 1976-1980, 92.3% in 1981-1985 and 97.0% in 1986-1990 (in the later cohorts the 20 yr follow-up was not reached).",

Cystic Fibrosis Trust, Bromley, United Kingdom Objective: An FEV1 less than 30% predicted has been widely used as a trigger for consideration of lung transplantation as median mortality within two years is considered greater than 50% in this group (1). However, in a recent study of patients attending a specialist adult CF unit whose FEV1 was <30%, a marked improvement in survival was demonstrated, increasing from 1. 2 years in 1990-1991 to 5.3 years in 2002-2003 . To explore whether these results are generalisable to the general population of adult patients we examined data from the UK-wide Port CF database of specialist clinic annual reviews.",

Children Hospital and Research Center Oakland, Oakland, CA, USA; 3. Genetic Disease Screening Program, California Department of Public Health, Richmond, CA, USA California implemented newborn screening (NBS) for CF in July of 2007. The screening algorithm includes focused CFTR sequencing as a last step and allows for the detection of both known mutations as well as novel mutations and variants. Only infants with 2 or more mutations/variants detected are referred to CF centers for sweat chloride testing and further evaluation. While a positive sweat test represents definitive diagnostic criteria for CF, a good number of CF patients have sweat chloride values outside of the diagnostic range. Discordance between genetic results and sweat chloride results creates difficult diagnostic and treatment dilemmas. We have been conducting a longitudinal study with a uniform protocol for Sweat Testing and clinical evaluation to better understand the natural histo-ry of the disease among these infants with varying levels of CFTR dysfunction. A standard patient preparation protocol for sweat testing that includes salt supplementation (4 mmol per day for 3 days prior to testing) and adequate fluid intake guidelines has been implemented. Sweat testing is performed upon referral by the California NBS program (baseline), 1 month later, at 6 months of age and at 12 and 24 months of age. To date 25 infants have been enrolled (13 males) and have completed evaluation to their sixth month of age. Forty percent are Caucasian, 46% Hispanic/Latino and 14% Black. Median IRT for the group was 78 (range 64.6 to 211.2 ng/mL). Infants underwent a baseline evaluation at a mean age of 49 days and their mean baseline sweat chloride was 48.3 \u00b1 37 mmol/L. A mild correlation was noted between IRT and baseline sweat chloride (r = 0.54, p = 0.01). By genetic analysis, 57% of the alleles are affected by a severe mutation (class I-III), but only 27% of the infants carried two copies of severe mutations (either homozygote or compound heterozygote). As expected, by CFTR genotype patients carrying only severe mutations (classes I-III) had a higher baseline sweat Cl than patients carrying at least one mild mutation (classes IV-V), 105.4 vs 36 mmol/L. Infants with severe mutations were seen significantly earlier than infants with milder genotypes, 34 vs 59 days (p = 0.01), in part a reflection of the additional time required for focused sequencing to detect uncommon mutations. At the 1 month and 6 month evaluations sweat chloride values have not differed substantially from the initial test (48 and 54 mmol/L, respectively). When broken down by genotype, no definitive trends are noted in sweat chloride values over the first 6 months of life. In part this could be due to the limited sample size, but perhaps more importantly due to the limited period of observation. As our cohort ages and more infants are enrolled into the study we expect to be able to more firmly establish if there are any significant changes in sweat chloride by genotype in the first two years of life.",

Ongoing improvements also include the development of an RC evaluation process and career advancement track. In an effort to improve the cystic fibrosis (CF) research program at Stanford, the research team queried all research subjects who had participated in at least one CF study since 1992 about their experiences. Out of a population of 330 Stanford patients, 107 were identified as having participated in at least one study. The specific data from this project \"Survey to Assess Research Satisfaction at Stanford (STARS) was presented at the 2010 NACF conference. This left a large number of patients who had either never participated in research, or had never participated in a study at Stanford. As a follow-up to the original project the research team decided to explore the reasons for nonparticipation. A brief survey was developed to investigate whether or not the patient/child had ever participated in any research studies at Stanford. If not, what was the primary reason for nonparticipation. They were also asked if there was interest in participating in future studies, and if so, how would they like to hear about them and who would they like to hear about them from.",

Background: Quality improvement (QI) initiatives have become primary drivers for improving clinical outcomes in CF. Despite multiple QI activities, key outcomes in our program have remained below targets. The benefits of asthma action plans have been well documented. Despite similarities with respect to chronicity and a focus on self-management, there is no literature regarding the use of CF action plans (CFAP). There is some evidence that reviewing individual patient data and counseling lead to better adherence and improved outcomes. The CF Foundation recommends that Patient Registry reports be shared with patients. Despite the availability of five CF action plans in an electronic medical record and Registry-based Individualized Patient Registry Reports (IPRR), these resources were not being utilized.

Pediatrics, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA Background: Data from our center indicate that pulmonary outcomes for patients who live a long distance from our CF center (> 120 miles) are worse than for those who live closer. The reason for this seems to be related to delays in treatment of lung exacerbations. This delay appears to be caused by a combination of inability to come to the CF clinic regularly, failure of local providers to recognize and treat exacerbations effectively, and perhaps social issues inherent to a long distance population. We hypothesized that we could improve access to care for these patients by developing a \"virtual office visit\" using a web based system that included standardized clinical questions and home spirometry.",

Our data indicate that symptom scores and FEV1 can be obtained over the internet with interventions being initiated by person to person contact. We found that a large percentage of patient encounters led to specific interventions. The data indicate that patients are more likely to submit data when they have an increase in symptoms than on a routine basis. The protocol adherence rate was similar to that seen in a previous study of home monitoring in adults with CF. The major barriers to data submission seem to be forgetfulness and denial, i.e., not wanting to see their FEV1 outcome. The next step in the evolution of home symptom and FEV1 monitoring may be to move from demonstration mode to routine practice. We believe that EMR systems that allow for patient to provider interaction (e.g., My Chart in EPIC) hold great promise in this regard. (Supported by a CFF QI grant).",

Medtracker was a past quality improvement effort that focused on medications prescribed when patients were clinically eligible to receive them. Greater than 90% adherence was found for prescribing indicated medications. How medications and therapies were utilized by patients was less rigorously evaluated. Previously our practice had been to verbally teach each new therapy added to a CF patient's regimen. Careful attention was paid to cleaning and disinfecting of respiratory equipment, type of equipment used, and order of medications. The annual respiratory assessment (ARA) was performed with close-ended (yes/no) questions. Families were provided individualized written recommendations and feedback. The ARA required an average of 30 minutes of clinic time to complete. Recently, our Center participated in an adolescent adherence study (iCARE) which shifted us from verbal instruction of respiratory techniques and medications to patient demonstration. We observed substantial deficiencies in the performance and knowledge of key respiratory therapies and medications in the adolescent population. A decision was made to modify the ARA for all patients. We similarly adopted this approach of instruction for newly diagnosed patients.",

We chose the following maintenance medications for self-administration program: SABA, ICS, hypertonic saline, dornase alfa, pancreatic enzymes and vitamins, nebulized tobramycin. We concluded that patients should choose whether to self administer, therefore a patient's consent form was created. A patient may choose to self administer some or all medications. Five metal boxes with a combination lock and separate drawers for each medication, were acquired for medication storage at bedside. Once pharmacy receives the orders indicating self-administration, the pharmacist fills the medication box with reconciled drugs. The nurse picks up the box from the pharmacy and delivers to the patient. The bedside nurse educates the patient to maintain a record of each time the patient administers a medication. Inventory of the box is taken every 24 hours and refilled. The inventory process allows for the nurse to assess patient compliance. After discharge the box is delivered to a central facility for cleaning, and returned to pharmacy.",

In contrast to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, CFRD typically has an insidious onset and does not present with classic symptoms of polyuria or polydipsia. An unexplained decline in pulmonary function or an inability to gain weight despite aggressive nutritional intervention may be the only signs of underlying abnormalities in glucose metabolism. Uncontrolled CFRD can lead to microvascular complications of nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Because of its insidious onset and potential long-term complications, annual screening for and management of patients with CFRD is very important. The 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the screening tool recommended to diagnose CFRD.",

Beginning in August 2010, a pediatric endocrine fellow joined the CSRCHCFC team. Working along with the CF Center Director, she was given training in the care and management of patients with CF. Training specific to the diagnosis and management of CFRD occurred via a two week mentorship with Antoinette Moran, MD. As a part of quality improvement (QI), we developed an algo-rithm to improve screening of patients aged 8-18 years of age for CFRD at our center incorporating the 2010 CFRD Screening Guidelines. The algorithm is placed in the chart of each eligible patient prompting the physician to order the OGTT. The endocrine fellow is responsible for follow-up on the results, and together with the Center director implements a plan for management of abnormal results. The algorithm also introduced the concept of using continuous-glucose monitoring (CGM) in select patients with abnormal (impaired or indeterminate category) OGTT results to decide if early treatment with insulin could be beneficial. We improved algorithm chart placement from 54% in the 1st month to 84% in the second month. We also diagnosed one new patient with CFRD and placed CGM on 2 patients. Patients diagnosed with CFRD receive ongoing care by the endocrine fellow in CF clinic.

These findings suggest that establishing a transition program could be important in optimizing patient health, continuity of care, improving adherence, and hopefully reducing rate of patients lost to follow-up. The progressive nature of cystic fibrosis (CF) uniquely requires an intensity of care that escalates as the patient ages. Upon review of centerspecific data, it became apparent that the rate of pulmonary function decline is most pronounced in the emerging adult years (18 to 29 years); the primary reason is presumed to be non-adherence to treatments. Therefore QI efforts targeting the emerging adult population were undertaken. The global aim of CF quality improvement through the Adult Quality Improvement Initiative, (AQI 1) was to demonstrate substantial improvement in the nutrition and pulmonary outcomes of adults with CF, resulting in a set of best practices and specific change ideas for adult care. An adult specific CF knowledge and adherence assessment was developed with an aim to develop smart change ideas to improve adherence to prescribed therapies that would slow the rate of pulmonary and nutrition decline. The assessment tool included 58 questions separated into 5 sections with 10 questions specifically focused on their attitude and beliefs regarding adherence, and possible barriers to adherence. The tool was administered to 52 of 103 emerging adult individuals with CF via survey monkey. The results identified no significant knowledge deficits, but proved to be an excellent educational tool for individual patients. There were, however, several discrepancies between knowledge and adherence practices. We found 96% acknowledged the importance of treatments, however 37% only rarely or sometimes have a regular schedule for doing therapies, and 33% reported time management difficulties some, most, or all of the time. Thirty-one percent reported skipping airway clearance at least 3 or more times a week, and 20% reported skipping their enzymes at least once a day. Analysis of the data involved group discussion including two patient representatives as well as the whole multi-disciplinary CF team. The process generated a list of smart change ideas each of which can become a specific aim for further analysis. A \"shotgun\" approach to testing these ideas is underway to help identify those that will contribute to best practices for adult care in the emerging adult CF population. Background: Pulmonary exacerbations are often associated with hospitalizations, concurrent weight loss and poor appetite. Estimated energy requirements for the cystic fibrosis (CF) population are up to 200% that of the general population and are influenced by severity of lung disease, degree of malabsorption, and other factors. The link between nutritional status and survival is well established. Optimizing in-hospital nutritional intake is critical for improving weight during exacerbations.",

Background: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) practice guidelines recommend that all patients \u2265 age 6 should use dornase alfa and hypertonic saline on a daily basis, and those \u2265 age 6 colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa should use inhaled tobramycin (TOBI) and oral azithromycin to improve lung function and reduce pulmonary exacerbations. A decline in FEV1 was noted in the 6-17 and 13-17 year old age groups in our 2008 CF Center Report. We hypothesized that increasing clinician adherence to prescribing guidelines for these pulmonary medications would improve mean FEV1 in 6-18 year olds.",

Using Port CF we identified patients that were eligible to receive recommended therapies, determined whether they were prescribed those therapies, and collected baseline FEV1 data. We followed adherence rates and FEV1 quarterly for 1 year. Providers received a quarterly \"report card\" with adherence rates and mean FEV1 compared to colleagues, as well as a list of eligible patients that were not on recommended therapies. Chi-square compared adherence rates between physicians. Two-sample t-test compared mean FEV1 between adherence groups for each medication. ANOVA compared mean FEV1 by quarter.

Although mean FEV1 showed improvement after several months of sustained adherence, it did not reach statistical significance. Improved adherence may not necessarily translate into improved mean FEV1, but may instead slow/halt the rate of decline in FEV1. Longer follow-up may demonstrate this. The trend towards a longer and healthier life in CF patients is, in large part, due to better nutrition. There is a definite correlation between good nutritional status and increased pulmonary function, immune defense mechanisms and survival. Unfortunately, there are still great variations in the nutritional status of CF patients. At MUSC, our median BMI percentiles and BMIs were below the national average in 2009. As a result, we developed a quality improvement program aimed at improving the nutritional health of CF patients by providing relevant nutritional education to our patients and their families.",

After the initial testing was completed, analysis of the results showed that the questions most commonly missed pertained to malabsorption, calories, fat, and behavior. Educational materials about these four areas were developed and these materials and verbal education were provided to all patients by a dietitian during their quarterly clinic visits. The final educational cycle is ongoing and the success of this program will be determined at the end of this cycle by having patients take the same nutrition test again and comparing scores, and by verifying whether an improvement in BMI (or BMI percentile) is noted.",

The results support our contention that improving nutritional knowledge amongst the CF population and their families will have a positive impact on nutritional outcomes. The data also suggests that implementing aggressive nutritional interventions and optimizing education are most beneficial during childhood when the patient (and family) is perhaps more flexible and willing to adjust their lifestyle and feels they will benefit from doing so.

Our specific aim is to increase our CF center's mean BMI percentile by 5% for patients 2-20 years.

After these barriers were identified, a working group consisting of representation from pediatric and lab administration, clinic and lab staff and members of the CF team met. These stakeholders agreed to change the process and offer phlebotomy in the patient exam room at the time of the CF clinic visit. The clinic staff was trained in blood drawing by the phlebotomists. A pilot study of blood collections in the CF care center was performed during 3 months with a total of 27 patient/family surveys completed. Family feedback revealed complete support for the revised process resulting in full implementation after the pilot. The study team evaluated and compared blood draw adherence for two consecutive 14 month epochs: 12/2/2008 to 2/1/2010 and 2/2/2010 to 4/1/2011. The first epoch occurred prior to the pilot project. There were a total of 73 CF patients evaluated for annual lab draw adherence. During the first epoch 58 patients (79.4%) had their annual CF lab draws completed. During the second epoch 69 patients (94.5%) completed their annual lab draws. This is an increase of 15% in adherence to CF annual lab draws when performed in the CF clinic exam room.",

Increased CF patient adherence to annual lab draws was identified with the change to blood draws in the CF clinic visit exam room. Both adherence rates and family satisfaction were improved. CF parental feedback included the increase in convenience, decreased exposure to infection and reduced time at the center on the day of annual lab draws. The old IC guidelines allowed patients without B. cepacia to leave their rooms for individual activities and to use food vouchers in the cafeteria for individual food selection. New IC guidelines required all patients with CF to be isolated to their rooms during inpatient admissions. With the new IC guidelines, food service and clinical nutrition initiated room service delivery style food delivery (RS). Three host/hostesses were assigned solely to patients with CF to tend to their food service needs and were accessible by a wireless communication system. Patients were able to view the daily menus on-line and/or a patient TV channel. Menus available for patients to select from were the alternative menu, caf\u00e9 menu, and patient tray line menu options. In addition, patients also received one $15 food voucher for use in the caf\u00e9 or snack store by a family member/friend for the patient.",

Specific gaps identified during the survey (condiments not sent with food; portion sizes too small; older teens prefer paper menus) have provided insight into areas of improvement for both food service and the CF team. Background: Patients with CF are at risk for developing CFRD. The diagnosis of CFRD has a negative impact on pulmonary function and survival. The CF Foundation recommends OGTT as the annual screening for CFRD in patients 10 years and older. The December 2010 CF Consensus Guidelines for Care of the CF Patient recommend a multidisciplinary team approach with the inclusion of endocrinology support. Adherence to annual screening with OGTT has been a challenge for many pediatric patients and their families at our center. To address this, the inclusion of an endocrine specialty nurse to the CF Care team was initiated. Her specific role was to increase the focus of the CF Team on CFRD and to educate patients and families about the importance of diagnosis and management of this common CF co-morbidity. The endocrine specialty nurse attends CF Clinics, provides education about CFRD and has placed a CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) device on several CF patients for initial screening. CGM has been identified as a useful tool for initial screening for CFRD.",

After discussion with the endocrine team, the endocrine specialty nurse became available to attend CF Clinic sessions to offer initial screening for CFRD via the CGM and stress the importance of diagnosing and treating CFRD. Patients requiring CFRD screening or CFRD follow-up were identified prior to CF clinic, and the endocrine specialty nurse met with the patient and family during the subsequent CF clinic visit. The endocrine specialty nurse provided education regarding CFRD and offered screening with CGM during the clinic visit. The study team evaluated and compared yearly OGTT/CFRD screening adherence for two consecutive 12 month epochs: 10/1/08 to 9/30/09 and 10/1/09 to 9/30/10. The first epoch occurred prior to the addition of the endocrine specialty nurse, and during CFRD screening recommendations for patients 13-years and older. There were a total of 20 CF patients eligible for CFRD screening during the first epoch, with only 2 (10%) completing OGTT. The second epoch occurred during the addition of the endocrine specialty nurse and during the period of CFRD screening beginning at 10-years of age. During the second epoch, 19 of 40 (47.5%) eligible CF patients completed screening with either OGTT or CGM.

Our findings suggest that a standardized scoring system in this age group may help objectively identify pulmonary exacerbations and help guide treatment. The course of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is typically punctuated by pulmonary exacerbations (PEs), which appear to play an important role in pulmonary function decline. We have been interested in utilizing an electronic PE score (PES) tool to develop a more proactive approach to treatment of PE's (1).

Cost and convenience were also important. By implementing a systematic approach to education, ordering, screening, tracking and documenting, the team was able to improve oral glucose tolerance testing rates. Clinical care and research require accurate and organized data. We have built a comprehensive, web-based system, CF CenterCare, to manage clinical and research data for our Adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Care Center. Such a system will improve patient care by streamlining decision making, ensure adherence to CF guidelines for care, facilitate further QI initiatives and thereby improve nutritional and pulmonary outcomes for patients at our CF Center. Several of these outcomes will be measurable using Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry center reports and local QI data. At our CF center the system will be used to follow 120 patients in the Adult Program, with plans to extend its use to the 180 patients in the Pediatric Program in the near future. The project was implemented using a three-tier, web-based architecture. The user interface is compatible with commonly used browsers. The middle tier containing the business logic of the application is written in Java programming language. The data storage tier resides on the Oracle 11g database server and contains more than 80 tables with over 1,000 attributes. Security is addressed using the electronic information security standards mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) is stored encrypted in the database. The project is being implemented in two phases. In phase 1 the system was designed to allow web-based data input and reporting in real time at the point of care. The software tracks complex medical problems and medications in a prioritized, focused manner useful for clinical decision making during clinical encounters and for later review and/or research purposes. The system is also designed to generate, modify and print outputs such as patient education information, discharge action plans, pre-clinic planning forms and CFF Registry information. Other outputs include annotated pulmonary function trending, graphic representation of lung exam findings and detailed medication and problem list history. In phase 2 of the project, encounter data will be exchanged between CF Cen-terCare and the permanent electronic medical record. An additional goal is to work with the CFF to automate data uploads into the CFF Patient Registry. When fully implemented, CF CenterCare will streamline clinical data entry from the point of care where it will facilitate clinical decision-making, drive adherence to best practice guidelines, and enable the collection of research-quality clinical information. The use of such a system by multiple CF Centers with electronic throughput into the CFF Patient Registry would enable efficient, accurate and complete data transmission, where the data can also be shared with the clinical and basic science research communities. Cystic fibrosis is a multisystem disorder involving the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Poor nutritional absorption, inadequate caloric intake and subsequent difficulty in weight gain are inherent in the disease. CFF guidelines define optimal nutrition as a BMI percentile of 50% or greater in children or a weight/length of 50% up to 2 years of age. The median BMI percentile for our center was 46%, with 50% of patients having BMI below the 40%. Our goal is to increase the median BMI of the CF center by focusing on BMI in our pre-clinic planning and incorporating multiple team members to reinforce the importance of the goal, targeting the group of patients at nutrition risk with BMI below 40%.",

The nutritionist was a required part of clinic visits. A checklist was developed to address: evaluation of GERD (gastroesophogeal reflux disease), H2blocker or PPI use, oral supplements, high calorie foods, adequate enzyme dosing with appropriate administration. Appetite stimulants were discussed and often offered. Monitoring of blood glucose levels was initiated for those with impaired glucose tolerance. Social workers met with families to assess stressors around meals and offered behavioral interventions; a session was offered for parents to assist families in dealing with behavioral eating issues, which five families attended. Short term goals were set with patients and families: either 1-2 pound weight gain, additional calories, or supplemental shake at each encounter. Before this program patients would be given many chances to gain weight over several years before a gastrostomy tube was agreed upon, and referral to GI when they were significantly malnourished. In this proactive approach, early visits with GI were started to detect many subtle problems contributing to poor appetite. The GI physician became an integral part of the CF team.

The association between nutritional status, pulmonary function and survival in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been demonstrated in multiple studies. A previous study at Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne (RCH) (300 pediatric CF patients) demonstrated suboptimal referral practices and further supported the importance of early nutritional intervention in children with CF. A subsequent state government audit identified that patients were receiving dietary advice from dietitians on average at 1.4 outpatients clinics (OPD) per year despite patients attending an average of 4.3 OPD per year. Additional financial support for the clinic was provided by the government including employment of an extra full-time dietitian.

Introduction: Good nutrition is the foundation upon which the overall health status of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is built. CF Foundation guidelines recommend that CF patients maintain a BMI percentile at or above the 50th percentile for optimum health. Children with CF require a much higher caloric intake than do children without CF. Malabsorption, chronic lung disease, and infection can increase caloric demands, leading to poor nutrition. Most children with CF require nutritional supplements (NS) to maintain BMI percentile and general health. The annual cost for NS for our patient population can range from $720.00 to $5800.00 per year. Many private insurance plans do not pay for NS, requiring families to pay out of pocket. We estimate that 35% of families in our program struggle to pay for, or cannot afford, NS. We hypothesize that nutritional outcomes, as measured by BMI percentile for age, can be improved when patients who cannot afford NS are provided with supplements free of charge through an internal financial assistance program.",

A multidisciplinary committee, including physicians, nurses, dietitians, social workers, and a psychologist, identified patients who would benefit from the FAP. Barriers specific to each patient attaining adequate nutritional status were identified and addressed. The committee assured that the families had exhausted all other potential resources for nutritional remediation. Families signed a contract and agreed to monthly weight checks. Eligible patients initially received NS for 3 months. Preliminary results were encouraging and assistance later extended to 6 months. Upon exiting the program, families were allowed to continue NS by self-pay at a reduced rate.",

Effective and timely evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain may improve patients' quality of life in these domains. Higher BMI percentile for age is associated with improved quality of life in the body image domain. Adolescent females may be more satisfied with a lower BMI percentile which may adversely impact their nutritional status and overall outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine causal relationships. Objective: Vitamin D deficiency is common in CF. Recent literature in the general population has shown that vitamin D may have an effect on lung function and on the lung's ability to fight infection. This is important in the CF population in which pulmonary exacerbations and decline in lung function cause significant morbidity and mortality. The relationship between vitamin D and lung function in children is not well established. We hypothesize that children with lower vitamin D levels at baseline will have worse pulmonary function at baseline and in later childhood, more impaired growth, more pulmonary exacerbations and earlier detection of pulmonary bacterial pathogens than those with higher vitamin D levels.",

Background: Despite the pivotal role of nutrition in CF, current approaches to treat muscle loss by nutritional intervention have only been partially successful. To circumvent diminished protein digestibility due to pancreatic insufficiency in CF, (semi) elemental diets containing free amino acids are advised. We and others have previously found in diseases and conditions associated with muscle wasting that mixtures of essential amino acids (EAA) are more effective in stimulating whole body and muscle protein synthesis than equal amounts of balanced mixtures of EAA and nonessential amino acids as present in dietary (milk) protein.

Our recent studies showed that normal mucus secretion requires the presence of CFTR-dependent HCO 3 secretion.

Fluorescent microbeads (500 nm) were added to mucus samples collected from incubated intestinal sacs. The movement of the microbeads was recorded by cinematography and analyzed by spot tracking software. To study HCO 3 secretion, segments of the WT or CFTR knock-out mouse distal small intestine were placed in Ussing chambers, and HCO 3 secretion was measured via pH stat. Results: To obtain maximal mucus secretion, 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, 10 \u00b5M) plus PGE2 (prostaglandin E2, 1 \u00b5M) were added to the basolateral solutions. The viscosity of mucus from intestines bathed in NaCl Ringer solution was significantly more than mucus from intestines bathed in NaHCO 3 Ringer solution (3.2 \u00b1 0.7 vs. 1 \u00b1 0.1 cPa.s, p < 0.05, n=3), respectively. To further show that HCO 3 secretion in small intestine is dependent on CFTR, the effect of a CFTR inhibitor (glyH-101) and CFTR knock-out mice were examined. Apical application of GlyH-101 (25 \u00b5M) significantly inhibited 5-HT (10 \u00b5M) plus PGE2 (1 \u00b5M) -induced HCO 3 secretion from 0.73 \u00b1 0.24 to 0.16 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b5M/cm 2 /h (p < 0.05, n=6) in WT mouse distal small intestine. Furthermore, 5-HT (10 \u00b5M) plus PGE2 (1 \u00b5M) did not induce significant HCO 3 secretion in CFTR knock-out mouse distal small intestine, indicating that 5-HT +PGE2 -induced HCO 3 secretion is dependent on CFTR and that the abnormally viscous intestinal mucus in CF is likely due to depressed HCO 3 secretion in the gut. (1, 2) . Recently, vitamin A supplementation in utero has been linked to improved lung growth, development and function (3, 4) . In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, normal vitamin A levels were recently shown to have a protective effect on the respiratory status of older patients (5) . Does the protective effect of vitamin A, shown to be important in lung growth and development in utero, continue throughout early childhood; and if so, do CF patients with normal vitamin A levels at the time of diagnosis have better lung growth and development compared to CF patients with low vitamin A levels at the time of diagnosis? We performed a non concurrent, retrospective cohort study that identified 47 CF patients diagnosed at our center between the years of 1990 and 2000. We determined 33 patients had normal vitamin A levels at the time of diagnosis (16 of the patients were diagnosed with CF before two years of age and 17 were diagnosed after two years of age). Ten patients had low vitamin A levels at the time of diagnosis, (four in the group diagnosed before two years of age and six in the group diagnosed after two years of age). Four patients had high levels of vitamin A at the time of diagnosis. A two-tailed t-test was performed to evaluate the relationship of the vitamin A level at the time of diagnosis and lifetime highest FEV1 value. We found no statistical significance between vitamin A levels at the time of CF diagnosis and highest FEV1 attained (P=0.346). These results could be explained by all of our patients being born in the United States where maternal vitamin A deficiency is rare, and suggesting that maternal vitamin levels have a significant effect on initial lung growth and development. Also, lung growth can occur up until eight years of age and our CF patients with low vitamin A levels were, on average, 5 years of age with vitamin A supplementation being initiated before full lung development had occurred. Small numbers involved in our study may have not allowed for clear differences to be found.",

Pediatric and adult CF patients have abnormal plasma and tissue fatty acid profiles, specifically, deficient amounts of EFAs linoleic (LA, 18:2n-6) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA, indicating that dietary intake, absorption and/or further processing of EFAs is defective in CF. However, these abnormal fatty acid profiles are independent of pancreatic insufficiency and fat malabsorption, processes typically implicated as causing reduced growth in humans with CF. Linoleic acid supplementation fails to normal-ize LA and DHA plasma levels in CF patients, suggesting that the mechanisms of EFA deficiency in CF are more complex than simply inadequate nutrient intake. EFA deficiency has been demonstrated in mouse models of CF, but the results are conflicting. The objective in this work is to quantify plasma and liver fatty acid profiles representative of various developmental stages in F508del mice. We studied mice at neonatal (1-2 day old), postweaning (23-25 days old), young adult (42 days old), and mature (70 days old) time points. We measured growth-related indices, including body weight and dietary caloric intake. Thirteen fatty acids were extracted from plasma and liver samples and their concentrations determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We find that neonatal CF mice have normal FA plasma profiles except for a decreased level of arachidonic acid. Post-weaning CF mice have significantly decreased levels of several fatty acids including LA, linolenic, DHA and eicosapentanoic. This correlates with significantly reduced dietary intake at this age. By young adult age, plasma fatty acids are comparable or elevated above the wildtype levels which correlate with normalized dietary intake at this age. Fatty acid profiles in mature mice are currently being determined. We computed the desaturation ratios (16:1/16:0 and 18:1/18:0) and find that both are significantly decreased in post-weaning CF mice. Using the rationale of Ald\u00e1miz-Eschevarr\u00eda et. al. (Ped. Res, 2009 ), we determined various fatty acid ratios and find results similar to those reported in CF patients (specifically, elevated AA/LA and LA/DHA ratios) in both post-weaning and young adult mice. We also examined fatty acid profiles in the livers of all but neonatal mice. Our results show that palmitic and stearic fatty acids are elevated in postweaning CF mice but not in young adult mice suggesting that transport of those fatty acids from the liver may be affected in post-weaning CF mice. In summary, our preliminary results indicate that F508del mice have (i) normal fatty acid profiles while on maternal nutrition, (ii) deficient nutrient intake and essential fatty acid deficiency post-weaning, and (iii) normalization of dietary intake and fatty acid profile by adult/mature age. Based on our findings, we conclude that growth deficiency in CF mice has a complex etiology, involving an interplay between developmental stage and dietary intake. These studies are supported by the NIH and CF Foundation. Introduction: It is well known that underweight in patients with CF is correlated with a more rapid decline in lung function. Weight gain can improve lung function and weight is even known as an independent predictor of survival like lung function. We wanted to elucidate the influence of overweight and adiposity (BMI >90. percentile) on the long-term changes in lung function. Additionally we investigated the influence of pancreatic insufficiency and the genotype on body weight.",

The percentage of pancreatic insufficient patients was the same in both groups. \u2206F508 homozygosity was more frequent in the control group.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease. Increased survival and improved diagnostics have expanded the adult CF patient population. Historically, patients with fewer gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of CF tended to survive longer. This report describes the clinical presentation of a 69 year old female with cystic fibrosis who developed pancreatic insufficiency. Over 6 months this patient lost 24 pounds and her FEV1 decreased by 12%. She developed symptoms of malodorous stools, increased stool frequency, and bowel urgency. Serum cholesterol fell to 110 mg/dl. Work up included checking fecal elastase which documented pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy was initiated and symptoms of steatorrhea resolved. As the population demographics of cystic fibrosis evolve, clinicians must keep CF disease progression in all organs in mind. Diet history, weight history and lab results are important to assess the clinical picture and anticipate the development of pancreatic insufficiency. Background: Choline deficiency has been described in patients with CF. As a key membrane phospholipid, choline is required for methyl metabolism, cholinergic neurotransmission, trans-membrane signaling, lipid cholesterol metabolism and transport.

The results suggest choline status in CF can be improved with daily choline supplementation. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal inherited disease, characterized by chronic pulmonary infection, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and markedly reduced growth and low BMI which directly correlates with pulmonary function and survival of CF patients. This observation has led to improving and maintaining BMI as a clinical goal in CF. To achieve this goal, CF patients are recommended to consume hypercaloric diets (110-200% daily intake) high in saturated fat (>40% kcals). A recent review by Stallings et al concluded that this approach has been successful to increase body weight in some CF patients; however, a similar conclusion could not be made about patients' height. We previously showed that similar to CF patients, CF mice have markedly reduced growth, both weight and length and low adipose stores. Thus, we are investigating the use of mice models to test strategies for increasing morphometric indices in CF. Here we compare the effects of increasing the caloric content of diet to the effects of inducing hyperphagia. Our dietary strategy is to feed CF mice a high-fat, high-sucrose hypercaloric diet (HFHS, 58% fat as kcals) to simulate a CF patient diet. This diet results in morbid obesity in non-CF mice and, as we have found no evidence of fat malabsorption in CF mice fed a standard chow, we reasoned that a high-fat diet should promote weight gain. To induce hyperphagia, we used a genetic strategy in which we generated CF mice lacking functional leptin receptors (the ob allele). Both the dietary and genetic strategies use the R117H mouse, as it has comparable growth deficits to other CF mice, but less prone to lethal intestinal obstruction. Like mice on HFHS diet, ob/ob mice become grossly obese even on a low-fat diet, and thus we use this strategy to determine the capacity of the CF mouse to induce de novo lipogenesis and store lipids. Our preliminary results (Table 1) show that CF mice fed a high-fat diet had marginal weight/adipose tissue gain, while non-CF mice became obese. Fecal fat analyses revealed marked fat malabsorption by the CF mice and CF mice accrued only ~1/5th the adipose tissue compared to WT. We suspect that dietary lipids may be depositing in other organs than adipose tissue, e.g. liver and skeletal muscle. Indeed, analyses of liver samples revealed higher triglyceride content. Interestingly, both WT/LepR and CF/LepR mice fed the low-fat diet became grossly obese indicating high rates of de novo lipogenesis, adipogenesis, and triglyceride deposition. These results indicate that manipulation of metabolic pathways, such as leptin signaling, provides the ability to achieve weight gain in CF mice thus suggesting ways to optimize weight gain for CF patients.

While bone disease in CF is multifactorial, vitamin D malabsorption is hypothesized to play a large role in the development of low bone mineral density (Hall, 2010) .",

GER was measured using a 1 hour dynamic Tc99m gastric reflux study and the severity of reflux graded according to the number of reflux episodes observed in the esophagus (<10 = mild; 10-20=moderate; >20 = severe). Data from the first GE or GER study while on cisapride was compared with the most recent study before starting cisapride. All patients on cisapride followed a monitoring protocol which includes a baseline EKG, an EKG at 1 week, 6 months, and yearly while on the medication.",

Recent work suggests that these changes are mediated by increased expression and activity of \u22066-desaturase (D6D) in CF. However, the mechanism is unknown. Because expression of D6D is thought to be regulated primarily at the transcriptional level, we hypothesized that its overexpression in CF may be due to increased transcriptional activation. Studies have revealed two functional sterol regulatory elements (SRE), binding sites for sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and a functional peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE), binding site for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), in the D6D promoter. The objective of this study is to determine whether increased D6D expression in CF is due to transcriptional upregulation and if these changes are mediated by SREBP-1c and/or PPAR\u03b1.",

Background: Unhydroxylated vitamin D (e.g. ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol) is the most common form of vitamin D supplementation. However, fat malabsorption is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In non-CF populations, hydroxylated (polar) forms of vitamin D (e.g. calcidiol (25hydroxyvitamin D), calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)) have been shown to be more efficiently absorbed. In addition, it is postulated that unhydroxylated forms of vitamin D could benefit patients with CF by improving parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, increasing calcium absorption, and consequently improving serum calcium levels and bone mineral density (BMD). However, the efficacy and safety of these agents in CF has not been established.

The authors reported greater improvement in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level associated with cholecalciferol (from mean 21.2 (SD=10.18) ng/dL to 47.1 (SD=20.5) ng/dL) than with ergocalciferol (from mean 24.4 (SD=10.3) ng/dL to 32.7 (SD=9.7) ng/dL).

We identified one RCT which found both interventions to be safe and effective in achieving or maintaining optimal vitamin D status, with cholecalciferol being more effective. However, the formulations of the two interventions differed (oil-based versus powder-based) and study duration was insufficient to ascertain longer-term impact on vitamin D levels and bone mineral density. We recommend more comparative studies with longer follow-up. Background: Serum concentration of vitamin D influences several outcomes (serum albumin levels, bone mineral density, lung function, etc.) in cystic fibrosis (CF). Lung function is indicative of the severity of disease in CF. The correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and FEV1, an important measure of lung function, is poorly understood in patients with CF. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lung function.",

            "text": "Maternal and infant outcomes are positive for most women with cystic fibrosis who have sub-optimal body mass index. Prepregnancy maternal BMI and FEV1 remain strong predictors of these measures 6 months after delivery. There is much variability in the health outcomes during pregnancy regardless of weight and pulmonary status, suggesting that all women with CF remain at risk for adverse health outcomes due to pregnancy and should be monitored closely and frequently during this time. Nutrition interventions to promote adequate weight gain and overall optimal nutritional status for pregnancy should begin in the prenatal period, and continue throughout the patient's pregnancy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Disease is common in the CF exocrine pancreas eventually leading to complete destruction of the exocrine organ, while disease of the endocrine pancreas leads to CF related diabetes (CFRD). Because early beta cell pathology in CF is not well described in humans, we studied neonatal CF and non-CF pig pancreas using insulin immunostaining to determine the cellular distribution and density of beta cells. In both groups, beta cells were loosely organized as varying sized small islets to solitary cells within the parenchyma. CF pig pancreas had reduced lobularity with corresponding increased interlobular connective tissue as has been reported. Interestingly, most of the CF beta cells were restricted to within or immediately adjacent to these remnant lobules. In contrast, the interlobular space had an absence of beta cells (as well as islets). We then examined the amount of beta cells in whole pancreas tissue (average ~3-4 cm 2 / tissue section) and found that beta cell tissue density did not differ between CF and non-CF groups (NS, Mann-Whitney test). However, when we examined the amount of beta cells in lobular tissues, CF pancreas had increased beta cell tissue density compared to non-CF groups (P<0.05, Mann-Whitney). The results of this study give some insight into CF pathogenesis and have implications for future studies. 1) The extent of beta cells, as assessed by insulin immunostaining, does not appear to be altered at birth and suggests morphologic changes may be a result of postnatal pathophysiology. Importantly, this work does not completely rule out pathophysiologic differences between groups at birth. 2) Consistent with islet derivation from developing duct progenitors, beta cells are generally restricted to the diminutive lobules of the CF pig pancreas and are lacking from the expanded interlobular spaces. Accordingly, generous sampling of CF pig pancreas is essential to prevent artifactually low or high estimation of beta cell populations. 3) Increased beta cell numbers within the remnant lobules of the neonatal pig pancreas may reflect the findings of early autopsy studies where CF infant pancreas was sometimes described in pathology reports to have increased islets. Future fetal and postnatal studies combined with clinical analysis of endocrine pancreas function will further define the role of beta cells in the pathogenesis of CF related diabetes. The frequency of CF related diabetes (CFRD) continues to rise. The presence of CFTR in rat pancreatic islets was recently described, but was primarily on glucagon secreting alpha cells. Previous clinical studies demonstrated a reduced glucagon response to hypoglycemia in pancreatic insufficient CF subjects. As Cftr knockout (Cftr-/-) mice do not develop pancreatic disease, defects in glucagon response would be indicative of intrinsic cellular abnormalities. We hypothesized that Cftr-/-mice would have reduced responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.",

Cftr knockout mice may not undergo the same endoplasmic reticulum stress compared to deltaF508 mice. Additional studies are underway to compare differences in these animals. Background:Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) increases morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Abnormal glucose excursions can already be observed in pre-diabetic CF patients and those with normal glucose tolerance when compared to healthy controls. During this pre-diabetic phase, patients loose lung function years before the diagnosis of CFRD. The mechanisms of this deterioration of lung function are unknown and could be related to repeated hyperglycaemic excursions that can potentially affect the immune system and in particular lymphocytes. Hyperglycemia has been shown to promote altered immune responses and could affect T lymphocytes subtypes and cytokine production. Th17 cells have been shown to be present in the lungs of CF patients. Th17 cells secrete IL-17a, a cytokine implicated in many autoimmune diseases and increased levels of IL-17a are possibly involved in airway tissue destruction. Hypothesis: Compared to healthy control subjects; CF patients would present an increase in IL-17a production by Th17 cells which will be further exacerbated in hyperglycaemic conditions. Subjects and methods: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from 8 control subjects and 10 CF patients (2 with normal glucose tolerance, 2 pre-diabetics and 6 CFRD) and cultured in medium containing either 5 mM of glucose (normoglycaemic conditions) or 25 mM of glucose (hyperglycaemic conditions) for 24 or 48 hrs. To evaluate the proportion of cells producing IL-17a, cells were stained for surface markers (CD3, CD4, CD25), and intracellular FOXP3 and IL-17a to identify cell subsets producing IL-17a, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: When cultured under normal glycemic conditions for 24 or 48 hrs, no difference was observed between CF patients and controls for IL-17a production by Th17 cells. However, we found that under hyperglycaemic culture conditions for 24 hrs and 48 hrs, a greater proportion of CD3+ CD4+ CD25cells secreted IL-17 among lymphocytes isolated from CF patients compared to controls. Conclusion: Th17 lymphocytes from CF patients cultured under hyperglycaemic conditions produce more IL-17a than those of healthy counterparts. Our data suggests that frequent glucose excursions in CF patients might contribute to increased Il-17a secretion which could possibly contribute to tissue inflammation. Further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms involved in the increased IL-17a secretion by IL-17a secreting T cells in CF patients in hyperglycaemic conditions.",

The program optimizes transition by providing patients a comprehensive program complete with developmentally appropriate tasks and activities that are consistent from early childhood to adolescence. TeamUP focuses mainly on the patient who is at the center of transition. Patients who are empowered to ask questions of their doctors will have a greater confidence in their ability to guide their own healthcare.

Further investigations will be important in refining prevalence estimates, tracking changes over the trajectory of the illness, and identifying potential markers for risk and resilience. In particular, increased age and lower religiousness appear to be associated with distress, and merit further scrutiny. There have been longstanding concerns about adherence among cystic fibrosis patients, in view of the highly demanding treatment regimens that these individuals must manage. Adherence to airway clearance procedures has been particularly problematic. Compared with research on children with cystic fibrosis, however, fewer studies have focused on adherence among adults. This study examined levels of self-reported adherence among patients in a cystic fibrosis clinic serving a rural Southern state. Participants were adults (18 years and older), average age was 27.5, and mean household income was modest.

CBT is an evidence-based treatment for emotional adjustment problems. It addresses unhelpful thinking and worrying and promotes understanding of how thoughts, mood, behavior and physical symptoms interact. CBT can be learnt by members of the CF team and used to support patients.

The efficacy with which adolescents cope is likely to affect important psychological and health outcomes, such as healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL). Although coping may be an important moderator of adjustment, previous studies have utilized generic coping measures that are not specific to the disease or context.

Secondly, studies have shown that parents' views tend to be different than their child's, and the child's evaluation of health status may be closer to the clinical score. Regarding the inverse relationship between proxy perception of severity and proxy satisfaction, our hypothesis is that parents are dissatisfied with the fact that their child has cystic fibrosis, but the current health status may be better than it was at an earlier time.",

To assess the relationship between positive R/S coping and rate of decline in FEV1% predicted, we tested the interaction between positive R/S coping score and time (measured as age in years) in the model. All statistical analyses were implemented in SAS 9.2. Results: Data were obtained for n=42 adolescents (n=30 male), mean age of 13.6 yrs (SD=4.1; range: 9.9-19.9) and mean baseline FEV1% = 92 (SD=23).

Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA, USA; 2. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA; 3. Health Systems Management, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA Objective: To describe the age group-specific prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection and antibiotic resistance reported in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) in 2003 and 2008.Methods: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were identified from the CFFPR in 2003 and 2008. The CFFPR questionnaire included an updated microbiology section in 2003, which remained unchanged through 2008. In these years, we assessed the proportion of patients with cultures, and the proportion of cultured patients that were positive for PA. Among PA-positive patients with antibiotic susceptibility testing, we assessed proportions with resistance to aminoglycosides, quinolones or beta lactams, and the proportion with multiple antibiotic resistant PA (MARPA; defined as resistance to \u2265 2 of the aforementioned antibiotic classes). Resistance status is reported as a yes/no variable in the CFFPR; in vitro breakpoints are not recorded. Rates of PA infection and PA antibiotic resistance were summarized in 2003 and 2008 and by age categories(0-5, 6-12, 13-17, 18-25, and  \u2265 26 years).Results: A total of 21,127 and 24,930 patients with a valid CF diagnosis were identified in 2003 and 2008, respectively. The proportion of patients with sputum cultures was 92% in both 2003 and 2008. Consistent with the CFFPR annual reports for these years, the prevalence of reported PA infection among cultured patients decreased from 2003 to 2008 among all age groups",

Median [range] %-predicted FEV 1 was 61 [36-90]. Median [range] sweat chloride was 102 [22-126] mEq/L. Median [range] change chloride-free plus isoproterenol conductance was 1.7 [-5.0 -12.3]. Median [range] CFQ-R respiratory domain score was 72 [11-100]. Median [range] EXACT total score was 26.2 [0-55]. Median [range] coughs per hour while awake was 16 [0-76]. Conclusion: Pretreatment data from this study document that patients with nmCF have significant CFTR dysfunction (demonstrated by the total chloride conductance and sweat chloride values) which is accompanied by substantial respiratory impairment, cough, and symptom burden. For this subpopulation of patients, ataluren may offer a potential therapy that addresses the underlying cause of the disease.

Burk-infected CF pts have been excluded from prior aerosolized antibiotic trials. Aztreonam has in vitro activity vs Burk and there are anecdotal reports of responses to compassionate use AZLI in Burkinfected pts. A 1 yr randomized placebo (PBO)-controlled blinded 2-part trial of AZLI was conducted at 35 sites in the US and Canada to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 24 and 48 weeks of continuous AZLI therapy in CF subjects with Burk infection in the airways. Initial results of the 24 week PBO-controlled phase are presented.Methods: CF pts \u22656 yrs old with chronic Burk infection (>50% of respiratory cultures positive in past year; confirmed Burk spp. by a reference lab) and stable pulmonary disease were enrolled. Pts were randomized to receive 24 weeks of AZLI 75 mg or PBO TID every day via a Pari Investigational eFlow\u00ae Nebulizer System, followed by 24 weeks of open label AZLI 75 mg TID daily for all pts.

We then performed a casecontrol study to evaluate risk factors for non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection. Each Case was individually matched for age and gender with up to 4 Controls, and clinical data at the date of first NTM isolate in Cases were compared with those of Controls at the same time. Multivariate conditional regression analysis was performed to establish risk factors for NTM.Results: From 2006 to 2010, 45 adults CF subjects had at least one positive isolate for NTM (NTM+ Cases): 44.4% had isolates from M. avium/M. intracellulare group and 53.3% from M. abcessus/ M. chelonae/ M. massiliensae group.

            "text": "Background: Pancreatic disease starts in utero in humans with cystic fibrosis (CF) and progresses over time to complete destruction of the organ. It is proposed that the lack of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leads to acidic, dehydrated, and protein-rich pancreatic secretions, which then plug the lumen and cause destruction of the gland.The steps between the lumen-occluding secretions and the pancreatic damage are not well understood.Hypothesis: Proinflammatory pathways are involved in the destruction of the pancreas in CF. Tissue remodeling (mucous cell metaplasia, duct cell proliferation) are late events.Methods: We used microarray gene expression profiling to explore the differences between CF and non-CF pig pancreata of newborn and fetal pigs (90 day gestation, normal pig gestation is ~ 115 days) (Newborn n=4 CF, n=8 non-CF; fetal n=4 CF, n=4 non-CF). Microarray findings were validated using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results: Microarray gene expression profiling of the newborn and 90 day-old CF fetal pig pancreas showed significant upregulation of proinflammatory, complement cascade (classical and alternative) and profibrotic pathways compared to non-CF. IL-8 and NF\u03baB expression (qRT-PCR) were increased in the CF fetal and newborn pig pancreas (48-and 1.5-fold increase in the fetus, p<0.001 and 0.05 respectively, CF vs. non-CF; 30-and 5-fold increase in the newborn, p<0.001 CF vs. non-CF), indicating that proinflammatory pathways were activated in utero. Complement 3 (C3), Introduction: Ultraviolet (UV) therapy has been shown to be effective in improving vitamin D levels in the general population. However, the efficacy of UV therapy has not been clearly demonstrated in cystic fibrosis (CF). We conducted a systematic review to address this question.",

The UV radiation source was the Sperti \"Del Sol\" portable tanning machine with 800 Watts tanning power producing 70% UVA/30% UVB rays with the patient at a distance of 14 inches from the tanning machine. Patients completed 5 sessions a week (3-10 minutes per session) at home. The second study, a case series involving 8 patients with CF, used the same UV radiation source as the RCT, but for 8 weeks. The third study, a non-RCT involving 30 participants, used three UVB TL 12/40 W fluorescent lamps placed at 50 cm distance from the body and administered for 1-10 minutes 1-3 times a week for 1-3 weeks.

Pulmonary Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA Background: Self-management programs aim to limit dysfunction and promote participation in normal activities by minimizing frequency and severity of disease symptoms and delay disease progression. 1 The success of a self-management program relies on collaboration between patients and providers to identify problems and set priorities and goals. In order to achieve optimal outcomes, we developed a quality improvement program focused on patient and family self management, an important contributor to health outcomes.Global Aim: We aim to improve patients' and families' ability to self manage their cystic fibrosis, as an active participant of the CF team. By working on this process, we expect to assist our patients with their goal of improved health and quality of life. It is important to work on this now because our team has been very successful with quality improvement from a medical perspective, but has not specifically addressed self management, a necessary component of chronic disease care and this will complement other QI efforts we have under way and improve our patients' global health status.Methods: Three workgroups developed improvements in self management through individualized action plans, goal setting and education. Each group utilized microsystem methodology for quality improvement to provide structure. In order to assess patients' and parents' abilities to manage disease and achieve their goals a survey was completed by patients over the age of 12 years and one or both caregivers of all patients, with a repeat survey to be completed after full completion of our self-management program.Results: Initial surveys were completed by 46% of families, 38% of adults and 47% of patients. On a 10 point scale with 10 being very confident, the average score for confidence in managing their health care was 8.74 for patients, 8.6 for adults and 8.78 for parents. In regards to achieving their health care goals, on a 5 point scale, with 1 being always achieving their goals, the average score was 1.74, 1.75 and 2.1 for parents, patients and adults respectively. Individualized action plans were developed for lung health (LAP), digestive health (DAP) and medications (MAP) and have been incorporated into clinical care. A complete process for goal setting and use of a goal setting action plan (GAP) has been developed and will be introduced in clinical care. Education is ongoing with both cataloging and development of resources that will be available and introduced in a systematic manner as part of routine clinical care.Conclusions: Prior to implementation of specific self-management strategies, patients and families report a high degree of confidence in managing their care and achieving their goals. We anticipate that increased attention to self-management in clinical care will further improve CF center clinical outcomes.Supported by funding from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 1.

The team consulted with several patients to better understand their perspectives on adherence and treatment burdens. We then conducted an initial assessment of baseline performance, setting global and specific aims for improvement, measuring CF treatment burden in terms of clinical, functional, satisfaction and outcomes and rapidly testing ideas for change using the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model. Through observational studies, interviews, and surveys, data were collected to understand patterns of practice including errors, misconceptions and misunderstandings in care delivery.Results: Our data revealed low adherence and knowledge for all maintenance therapies regardless of lung function. For example, when surveyed on usage of hypertonic saline (HS), 50% used HS on a regular basis, only 44% used it twice daily. Of the 50% that do not use HS, 65% never tried it, and 24% never heard of it. Results also showed a need for up-to-date education regarding treatment techniques and usage as 57% did not know the proper order of performing treatments; 86% do not combine treatments, a potential time-saving practice whilst 60% indicated that they were last educated about performing nebulized treatments a 'long time ago.' Improvement Plan: PDSA #1: Formal 1:1 education on ACT by RT. During the initial session, the patient meets with both RT and research assistant (RA) and is educated about the physiology of CF and given a questionnaire. The RT assesses ACT competency, gives time management tips, and educates on proper techniques, pulmonary hygiene, and appropriate equipment settings/fit. A follow-up phone call is made a week after the initial session to check on progress and schedule a 3-month appointment during which the patient retakes the questionnaire, and meets with the RT for evaluation and spirometry. PDSA #2: Patients are instructed on benefits of HS and encouraged to use it for 1 month.Effects of Change: Patients scored an average of 15% higher on ACT knowledge and adherence to ACT, as assessed by the RT, was improved.Preliminary Data: Twelve patients completing the education program showed no change in FEV1 at 3 month follow-up. This may be due to time being too short, the small number of patients, and sub-optimal timing as some patients had an acute exacerbation at the 3 month follow up. When our aims are eventually achieved, Standardize-Do-Study-Act (SDSA) cycles will be utilized to monitor adherence to new practice and education.Lessons Learnt: We learnt to rely on properly collected data; not on perceptions or notions. Our patients' HS use and ACT adherence were much lower than anticipated. Patients are very receptive to QI work and welcomed ACT training and other initiatives. Finally, all should be involved in quality improvement: patients, families, and administrative staff.This project was partially supported by CFF through the first adult Learning Leadership Collaborative.",

Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, USA Objective: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is accepted to be highly prevalent in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Aspiration of acid and nonacid reflux can potentially worsen CF lung disease. The aims of this crosssectional study were to describe the characteristics of GER in patients with CF and evaluate associations between GER and nutritional parameters, feeding characteristics, and pulmonary function.Methods: All patients from our CF center who had undergone esophageal impedance monitoring from 2005-2011 were identified from our impedance and CF databases. Impedance indices included: Total reflux episodes, acid reflux episodes, non-acid reflux episodes, reflux episodes to the proximal lead, acid exposure time, and reflux preceding cough correlation. GER was defined as >72 total reflux events on 24 hour monitoring. Clinical characteristics included age, gender, BMI or weight-for-length percentile (BMI-WFL%), gastrostomy tube, overnight gastrostomy feeds, baseline best FEV1%, and if the impedance study was done during a pulmonary exacerbation. Descriptive statistics evaluated associations between GER and other impedance indices and clinical characteristics. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Spearman correlations were used for comparisons of continuous variables, and chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.Results: This analysis included 38 subjects, aged 2 months to 24 years (median 11 years). The median BMI-LFW% was 25%, 14 (37%) had gastrostomy tubes, and 11 (29%) received overnight continuous feeds. Best previous FEV1% ranged from 28-121% (median 80%) and 25 (66%) were studied during a pulmonary exacerbation. There were 2592 total reflux events recorded of which 1021 (29%) were acid, 1571 (61%) were non-acid, and 946 (36%) reached the proximal lead. The prevalence of GER by total reflux episodes was 30%. Although all but 3 subjects were on anti-acid medications, 6 (16%) had an elevated acid exposure time of >4.2%. Refluxcough symptom correlation >50% was associated with total and proximal reflux episodes (p=0.009, 0.006). There were no differences in any parameter based on age or gender. Patients with gastrostomy or on overnight feeds were more likely to have a lower BMI-WFL% (p=0.05, 0.03) and lower FEV1% (p=0.08, 0.0005). They were not more likely to have increased GER, proximal events, or increased acid exposure time. No impedance indices correlated to BMI-WFL%. There was a trend to higher FEV1% in patients with GER. There was no correlation between FEV1% and total reflux episodes, proximal reflux episodes, or acid exposure time. There was no association between GER and pulmonary exacerbation.Discussion: GER is common in children and adolescents with CF. Surprisingly, GER does not appear to be more common in those with poorer lung function, admitted for a pulmonary exacerbation, and receiving continuous overnight gastrostomy feeds. Although frequent reflux episodes, reflux episodes reaching the proximal esophagus, and prolonged acid exposure time all increase risk of lung injury from chronic aspiration, no association was found between these indices and decreased lung function in this cohort.",

Verona CF Centre, Verona, Italy; 5. Beth Israel Deaconess & Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; 6. St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada Symptomatic pancreatitis (PANC) occurs predominantly in pancreatic sufficient (PS) CF patients. We recently reported PS patients who carry mild genotypes have a greater risk of developing PANC than those with severe genotypes. However, only 20% of PSCF patients develop pancreatitis and severity of CFTR mutations alone does not account for all occurrences of PANC, suggesting involvement of non-CFTR modifying factors (genetic +/-environmental). In contrast to previous studies evaluating genetic factors in pancreatitis which compared any individual with pancreatitis against \"healthy\" control, we investigated for genetic modifiers of PANC using a candidate gene approach, in a cohort of PSCF and patients with CFTRrelated disorders with and without PANC.Methods: Subjects were ascertained from the Canadian Consortium for Genetic Studies, Toronto CF Clinics and the Verona CF Centre. Subjects were excluded if they were <10 years old at time of last review. Patients with CFTR-related disorders included those with single organ manifestations of CF (chronic sinopulmonary disease, obstructive azoospermia, and pancreatitis) who either carry 2 CFTR mutations or 1 CFTR mutation and a borderline sweat test (30-59 mmol/L). Exocrine pancreatic function was confirmed objectively. Genotyping was performed for genes that are known to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis including SPINK1, PRSS2, cathepsin B (CTSB), chymotrypsin C (CTRC) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to compare subjects with PANC vs. no PANC; differences between groups were compared by logrank test.Results: In all, 369 PSCF (64 PANC, 305 without PANC) and 54 CFTR-related disorders (19 PANC, 35 without PANC) were ascertained. There were no significant differences between subjects with and without PANC with SPINK1, PRSS2, CTSB, CTRC and LPL mutations (P>0.05). However, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the age at first episode of PANC was significantly worse for subjects who carry a specific mutation in the SPINK1 gene (N34S) than for those who do not (P=0.02); 25% of the subjects with and without N34S mutation was estimated to have developed pancreatitis by 16 vs. 31 years old respectively.Conclusions: The SPINK1 mutation N34S is a genetic modifier for CF and CFTR-related pancreatitis and significantly increases the risk of pancreatitis.Introduction: Contrary to the general population, people with cystic fibrosis (CF) have, for primary nutritional recommendation, high-fat and high-calorie diets. This is mainly due to the fact that despite pancreatic enzymes supplementation (>80%), intestinal malabsorption persists.Objectives: Characterize lipid profiles, analyze the causes and potential complications of these abnormalities in CF patients and highlight a possible association with abnormal glucose tolerance.Subjects: Two hundred four CF subjects and 20 control subjects were included in this study. All subjects underwent an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to determine their glucose tolerance. Lipid profiles including triglycerides, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol were measured at fasting state. An electronic scale was used to determine body fat, lean mass and body mass index (BMI).Results: Hypertriglyceridemia (HPTG) was found in 20 CF patients subsequently matched with 20 CF patients non-HPTG. The matching criteria were gender, age, pancreatic insufficiency, genotype and status of glucose tolerance. Comparing the three groups (CF-HPTG, CF non-HPTG and non-CF) showed differences on insulin secretion and resistance. For a comparable glycemic status, CF-HPTG patients had lower insulin sensitivity resulting in a higher secretion of insulin. BMI, blood pressure and inflammation does not appear to differ between groups. Women tend to be more frequently affected than men to HPTG.Conclusion: HPTG appears to be an isolated phenomenon and does not seem to have any of the complications encountered in the general population. The cause and effect relationship between cough and gastroesophageal reflux in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been widely debated. The frequency in which 1) cough is associated with reflux, 2) cough precedes reflux or vice versa, 3) symptoms are triggered by acid versus non-acid reflux, and 4) distal versus proximal reflux causes cough are unknown. Our objective was to address these questions using impedance probe test (pH-MII) testing in patients with CF.Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with CF who underwent pH-MII testing between 2003 through 2010. pH-MII recordings were reviewed for each 24 hour study. Coughs were recorded on a symptom log by the patient. A cough was considered associated with a reflux event if it occurred within a 2 minute window before or after the cough. Validated measures of association between reflux and cough were calculated (symptom index, SI, symptom sensitivity index, SSI, and the symptom association probability, SAP) for each pH-MII study. We calculated the percent of time reflux was in the esophagus by summing the distal bolus clearance times and dividing by the total study duration. We used Spearman correlations to determine the relationship between reflux burden and symptom association.Results: Thirty-five patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 13.7 \u00b1 5.9 years. The mean percent-predicted FEV1 was 70% \u00b1 23%. There were 425 recorded coughs of which 222 (52%) were associated with reflux. The mean total number of coughs per patient during pH-MII was 12.5\u00b116. The mean number of coughs associated with reflux was 5.8 \u00b1 8.8. The mean SI, SSI and SAP were 38\u00b130%, 7\u00b111% and 55\u00b143, respectively. Thirty-one percent of coughs occurred before reflux compared to 69% after reflux. Of all of the coughs associated with reflux, 50% were associated with distal reflux and 50% with proximal reflux (p=1.0). There was a significant positive correlation between the SI (% of coughs associat-ed with reflux) and acid reflux suggesting that acid was more likely to trigger symptoms than non-acid reflux (Table) .Conclusions: In patients with CF, we found that 1) when cough is associated with reflux, the reflux is more likely to occur before the cough than after; 2) distal and proximal reflux are equally as likely to trigger a symptom; and 3) acid reflux is more likely to be associated with cough than nonacid reflux.Supported by: This research was supported by the CFF PALM 11A0 (KP), K23 DK073713 (RR), and R03DK089146 (RR).",

Resp Med, NUHNHS Trust, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 5. Child Health, Univ. of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom Background: Differences in body habitus may explain some of the variations in lung function observed between individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). We tested the hypothesis that increased body mass index and lean muscle mass were associated with higher lung function in cystic fibrosis. Serum creatinine was used as a biomarker for lean muscle mass [1] .Methods: The study population consisted of clinically stable adults with a diagnosis of CF identified from the UK CF Registry who provided data on body mass index (BMI) and serum creatinine levels at an annual assessment visit in 2008. Those individuals with a creatinine higher than 300 \u00b5mol/L were excluded from the analysis. The initial analysis used linear regression to adjust for potential confounders (age, height, gender) to assess linearity of associations observed. As the relationship of serum creatinine and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) was linear, data for this association is presented per standard deviation increment. The association between BMI and FEV1 was nonlinear and this is presented as a categorical variable.Results: A total of 2644 individuals provided complete data in 2008 and of these 56% were male. In the mutually adjusted model both serum creatinine and BMI were positively associated with both FEV1 and FVC. As this association effect was modified by gender (LRT for interaction, p=0.02), the analysis was stratified.A one standard deviation increment in serum creatinine was associated with an increase of FEV1 of 181mL (95% confidence intervals CI: +127 to +235) in males and 95mL (95% CI: +53 to +136) in females. Compared to the reference group of 20-24.9 Kg/m 2 , those with a BMI \u226419 had lower FEV1 Kg/m 2 with values of -645mL (95%CI: -780 to -510) for males and -464 mL (-556 to -371) for females.Conclusions: Both lower serum creatinine and a decreased BMI are independently associated with lower lung function in adults with CF. While BMI is considered an important clinical outcome in the management of CF, consideration of lean muscle mass as an independent outcome measure may be useful in future research and also in the provision of clinical care.Funding Aims: We performed a study to determine the prevalence of renal stones in patients attending the Manchester Adult CF Centre.Methods: A case note review was performed for all patients who attended the Manchester Adult CF Centre. All patients with an abdominal ultrasound scan in the years 2007-2009 were included in the study. Patient demographics including age, sex, %predicted FEV1, exocrine pancreatic status, and body mass index were recorded.Results: Case note review identified 273 of 330 patients who had an abdominal ultrasound scan in the study period. The case note review identified a history of stone disease in 17 out of 273 (6.3%) patients with CF attending our centre. A total of 252 patients have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (PI) and include 16 stone formers. The remaining stone former is amongst the 21 pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients. The stone formers had a lower mean (SD) %predicted FEV1 (46.7 (23.8)%) then non-stone formers (64.8 (24.4)%), p=0.004. There were no significant differences in mean (SD) age [30.7 (11.0) v. 27.0 (9.8) years, p=0.26], sex [8 (47%) males v.143 (55.9%) males p=0.480], or mean (SD) body mass index [21.5 (4.5) v. 21.5 (4.6) p=0.558] between stone formers and non-stone formers, respectively.Discussion: The prevalence of renal stones, as detected by ultrasonography, in the patients attending the Manchester Adult CF Centre is 6.3%. The patients who had renal stones on their ultrasound scan had a lower %FEV1 than patients without stones. As the number of adults with CF continues to increase and survival time continues to improve for those with severely impaired %FEV1, Adult CF Centres may increasingly encounter cases of renal stone disease in their patient population.Further studies are required to investigate the aetiology, guide prevention strategies and aid management of renal stone disease in CF.",

            "text": "Taylor, C.J.; Deakin, C. Academic Child Health, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom Objective: To identify any relationships between body composition, lung function and exercise tolerance in children with cystic fibrosis.Background: Many studies emphasise the need for children with CF to gain weight as this has been found to positively influence lung function and disease progression. However, with the recent concerns over childhood obesity, it is now being questioned whether excessive weight gain/ increased fat mass in CF patients can be detrimental to their exercise tolerance and lung function. This study aims to analyse how the body composition of children with CF may affect their exercise tolerance and lung function by comparing BMI, total body, fat free and fat masses with lung function and exercise capacity (assessed using the modified shuttle walk test) in order to ascertain whether there is an optimum body composition or type of weight gain for CF patients.Methods: Body composition -BMI%, total body mass (TBM), fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were assessed and compared to the lung function and exercise tolerance in 63 children with CF (mean; SD age 10. 3; 2.9, mean; SD FEV1%, 90.3; 16.2, mean; SD FVC%, 95.4; 16.9) . Correlations between variables were analysed using stepwise regression analysis via SPSS.Results: Correlations were found between exercise tolerance, TBM and FFM (0.3, 0.44 -Spearman's correlations respectively) which also showed weaker correlations with lung function (0.27, 0.26 respectively). FFM accounted for 14.4% of exercise tolerance but no body composition measures accounted for lung function to statistical significance (P less than 0.05).Conclusion: FFM was found to be the best predictor of exercise tolerance. Therefore, we conclude that patients should be encouraged to gain lean body mass, rather than weight in general, in order to maintain/improve exercise tolerance as this is the largest contributor to FFM. Purpose: We hypothesized that higher enzyme dosing, expressed as lipase units/kg/meal, is correlated with better nutritional status, as measured by average body mass index (BMI) percentile, at US CF Care Centers.",

            "text": "Methods: A retrospective analysis of the CF Foundation Patient Registry from 2005 to 2008 was performed. Patients 2 to 20 years old with pancreatic insufficiency or taking pancreatic enzyme supplementation were included. Centers with fewer than 10 unique patients were excluded. A descriptive analysis was performed for each year of the study. A linear mixed model with a random intercept was used to analyze continuous BMI percentile at the center level. The outcome measure was BMI percentile and the predictive variable was enzyme dose in lipase units per kilogram per meal. A quantile regression analysis was completed at the center and individual level.Results: Over the study period, the mean BMI percentile was 55.23 (range, 48-97) at top quartile centers and 24.25 (range, 0.14-36.7) at lowest quartile centers. Higher BMI quartile was associated with higher enzyme dose (Table) .A linear mixed model analysis at the center level did not demonstrate a significant relationship between enzyme dose and BMI percentile (p = 0.8) after adjustment for age. A statistically significant inverse relationship between enzyme dose and BMI percentile was noted at the individual level (p<0.05) via quantile regression analysis.Conclusion: Top performing US CF Centers for nutritional outcomes as measured by BMI percentile have higher enzyme dosing than lower performing centers. This effect does not persist when corrected for age. Furthermore, children with worse BMI percentile receive higher doses of enzyme replacement therapy per kilogram body weight than those with acceptable nutrition. This may represent prescribing patterns, in which patients with lower body weight receive more therapy. Further analysis is required to understand the relationship between enzyme dosing and nutritional outcomes in children with CF.Supported One of the main objectives in cystic fibrosis (CF) care is to achieve optimal growth 1 . Given protein is a major cellular structural component and functions as enzymes and hormones, it is important for both growth and to maintain a healthy immune system. While energy intake has received a great deal of attention in CF research and clinical care, macronutrient intake and its relationship to growth has not been previously investigated.Aims: To examine macronutrient intake in young children with CF, with specific focus on comparison to Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) macronutrient recommendations, and to compare specific macronutrient intake with trends in growth.Participants: Eight children (3 female, 5 male) with CF aged 3 to 8 years (mean 5.6).Methods: Macronutrient intake was obtained every 6 months for 4 years following a randomized clinical trial testing a behavior-nutrition treatment in toddlers with CF. Intake composition was assessed for each subject through three 24-hour diet recalls. Macronutrients were analyzed using Nutritional Data System for Research software.Results: Mean daily average percent calories from fat was 35.2% (range 22.9 -49.5) for all children. Two of 8 participants met CFF recommendation of 40% calories from fat at 2-year follow-up and 1 of 8 met recommendation at 4-year follow-up. There was no statistical difference from 2 (36.4%) to 4 (35.0%) years post-treatment. No significant correlation was found between BMI percentile and percent calories from fat. Mean daily percent calories from protein was 12.3% (range 7.5 -17.0). None of 8 participants met recommended 20-30% calories from protein at all time points in the 4-year follow-up. A Pearson correlation between BMI percentile and percent calories from protein approached traditional levels of significance, r = .255, p = .065.Conclusions: The 4-year follow-up results show that participants were not meeting recommendations for fat and protein intake, and their trends in consumption were stable over time. These findings demonstrate a need and opportunity to increase fat and protein intake to CFF recommendations. One way to achieve this aim would be to replace carbohydrate intake with fat and/or protein.Macronutrient intake in CF and its relationship to growth has not been previously investigated. In order to better understand how to achieve adequate growth in children with CF future research should examine the relationship between protein intake and growth. Data collection is currently underway to examine macronutrient intake in a cohort of approximately 70 young children with CF to expand on these preliminary findings.Supported by NIH grants R01DK54915 and K24DK59973 (Scott W Powers = PI).1.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, 35, [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] Methods: This systematic review was part of a broad evidence review of multiple questions to inform the development of CF Foundation clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D. We conducted an electronic search of published literature up to September 2010 on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CEN-TRAL to identify studies that addressed the correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lung function in persons with CF. We also reviewed the reference lists of all eligible studies.Results: We identified 4 studies with 656 participants. We did not combine study results quantitatively because of heterogeneity among studies. A retrospective cohort study with 337 participants reported a statistically significant correlation between FEV1 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D in an unadjusted analysis (r=0.21, p=0.004). Analysis revealed that for each 10% increase in FEV1, 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased by 1.0 ng/mL. Two cross-sectional studies reported no statistically significant correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and FEV1 from unadjusted analyses. One study with 101 participants reported no correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and FEV1 (p>0.05). The other study with 33 participants reported that 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlated weakly with FEV1% (r=0.07, p>0.1). This study also reported no statistically significant difference in mean FEV1% comparing participants with low vitamin D levels to those with normal vitamin D levels (63.3% versus 74.0%, p>0.05). Another cross-sectional study reported on the correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the 'best' and 'worst' annual FEV1 among 185 participants. The authors reported results from both unadjusted analyses and analyses that adjusted for age, gender, BMI, and race. In unadjusted analyses, the authors reported a statistically significant correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D with worst FEV1 only (worst FEV1: r=0.16, p=0.04 and best FEV1: r=0.1, p=0.17). A slightly stronger correlation was reported in the adjusted analyses. The correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D with worst FEV1 remained statistically significant (worst FEV1: r-squared=0.3, p<0.0001 (\u03b2=0.25, p=0.05) and best FEV1: \u03b2=0.24, p=0.07).Conclusions: Current evidence suggests a weak positive correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lung function in patients with CF. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were reported to correlate with FEV1 in one study while in another study, a significant correlation was reported only with worst annual FEV1. Further studies that account for the variation in lung function between individuals and within individuals at different time points (different pulmonary function status) are needed to better understand this correlation.",

            "text": "Katrangi, W.; Seegmiller, A.; Laposata, M. Pathology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA Objectives: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) exhibit a dysregulated airway inflammatory response. This could be due to an increase in the production of arachidonic acid (AA)-derived pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, which requires release of AA from membrane phospholipids. Studies have shown that AA release and eicosanoid production are increased in CF. The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of AA release in a CF cell culture model (16HBE).Methods: Experiments were performed in cultured 16HBE human bronchial epithelial cells stably transfected with plasmids containing the first 131 nucleotides of CFTR in the sense or antisense orientations, resulting in cells expressing CFTR (wild type phenotype, WT) or not expressing CFTR (CF-like phenotype, CF), respectively. Arachidonic acid release was evaluated by incubating confluent cells with 0.1 \u00b5Ci/mL 3 H AA for different time intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 24 hours. Cells were then stimulated by various concentrations (1-10 \u00b5M) of calcium ionophore A23187. Aliquots of supernatant were removed at different time points and cells were lysed. AA release was determined by measuring radioactivity associated with both supernatant and cell lysate.Results: At baseline, AA release varied from approximately equal in WT and CF cells to slightly higher in CF cells. Incubation with A23187 led to a marked dose-dependent stimulation of AA release that was approximately 2-fold higher in CF cells than in WT cells. AA release followed a time course with the largest difference between cells with and without CFTR observed at 15 and 30 minutes of stimulation with A23187.Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that CF cultured cells have a significantly higher rate of Ca +2 -dependent AA release in the initial phase of stimulation. This has implications for a defect in inflammatory response mediated by arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids. Background: DHA levels are known to be low in children and adults with CF. It is postulated that lack of DHA may predispose to increased inflammation and tissue destruction. DHA given in very high doses to CFTR-/-mice leads to reversal of pancreatic injury. Since pancreatic dysfunction evolves over the first year of life in many CF infants, we hypothesized that early treatment with low dose DHA might abrogate pancreatic destruction and lead to improved growth and preserved fecal elastase (FE) values. Furthermore, we wished to study the effect of DHA on chest x-ray findings and to follow the natural history of fatty acid (FA) levels in infants with CF.",

Since human breast milk contains varying amounts of DHA, only infants whose parents chose to bottle feed exclusively were enrolled. Infants were randomized to control formula (standard Enfamil\u00ae with no DHA or arachidonic acid [AA]) or LIPIL\u00aex3 (0.96% of FA as DHA and 0.64% as AA). Block randomization was performed based on FE measurement at screening, with a low FE and high FE group defined as FE \u2264 20 or FE > 20, respectively. Formula was provided until 12 months of age. Study visits were at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Parents were asked to submit monthly stool samples for FE determination. Primary endpoints were weight and height at 1 year of age and FE levels. Secondary endpoints included serum DHA and AA levels, IRT and alpha feto-protein levels at 3, 6, and 12 months of age and Brasfield CXR score at 1 year.Results: Of the 83 infants enrolled from US CF Centers, 48 received control formula and 35 received LIPIL\u00aex3. Sixty-eight infants (82%) had weight and height recorded at 12 months of age. There was no difference seen in height or weight z-score for age between the two formula groups at entry or at the end of the study. Both groups had negative height and weight z-scores at entry and both showed considerable movement toward the mean over the first 6 months of life. Human FE values were highly variable between individual children. There was no significant change in mean FE over the study period for either group. On average, subjects were on study formula for 9 months between the first and last FE measurement. Mean Brasfield scores at one year (n=66) did not differ between groups. FA levels, IRT and AFP measurements are pending and will be presented at the conference.Conclusion: This study shows that adding low dose DHA to infant formula does not affect growth or pancreatic function as measured by FE in the first year of life. However, it is possible that this study is under powered and a real difference between groups has been missed. Data presented reinforces the nutritional value of early diagnosis of CF, as all study infants had improved height and weight z-scores once they were followed in CF Centers. Furthermore, we anticipate seeing important information regarding the natural history of FE, AFP, IRT and FA levels in infants with CF over the first year of life.Supported by Mead Johnson Nutritionals and CFF (OSULLI03A0). As part of a larger study of the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on CF, we obtained stool samples for fecal elastase (FE) measurement monthly over the first year of life. In one study, two thirds of children with CF were born with residual pancreatic function and gradually lost this function, based on three day fat balance studies (Bronstein et al J Pediatr 1992). Ninety-two percent of this group was pancreatic insufficient (PI) by one year of age. FE has been shown to be an excellent indirect measure of pancreatic exocrine function with 86% specificity and 99% sensitivity in children with CF using a cut-point of 200 \u00b5g/gm of stool. Longitudinal studies of FE in the first year of life have not been carried out. Measurement of FE on a frequent basis in the first year of life may allow for illumination of the natural progression of pancreatic dysfunction in this patient population. We hypothesized this loss of pancreatic function to be reflected in a trend of decreasing FE with maturation.",

Results were reported as continuous values from 0 to greater than 500. All values >500 were recorded as being 501. Subjects in the main study could be on standard infant formula or formula supplemented with DHA and arachidonic acid. Infants with genotypes predictive of pancreatic sufficiency were allowed to enroll in the study.Results: Eighty-three infants had an initial FE measurement. Four of these did not have a second specimen sent to the laboratory. There were 664 samples analyzed on the remaining 79 infants. Of these, 46 received control formula and 33 received study formula. Fifty-one infants had 9 or more stool samples submitted. There was no difference in FE at baseline between the two formula groups and no difference in trend over time between the groups. There was wide inter-patient and some intra-patient variability in FE longitudinally. However, for the group as a whole the rate of change over the first year of life was not significant.We are currently analyzing the data in regards to FE changes over time in both formula groups, in those with initially high vs. low FE and by genotype (mild vs. severe pancreatic genotype).Discussion: This study allows us to look at the natural history of FE values over the first year of life in 46 infants who received control formula. Given that the study formula showed no statistical effect on FE change over the study period, we can pool the data and analyze FE changes in 79 infants. Knowledge about the reliability and/or degree of variability of this test will be important for clinicians. Since steatorrhea can be caused by one of three mechanisms (pancreatic dysfunction, bile salt pool abnormalities, and mucosal disease) our results may help to determine if the increase in steatorrhea seen in the first year of life in CF patients truly is due to a loss of pancreatic function or due to other causes. Objectives: G-tube placement is one option in CF Foundation evidencebased practice recommendations to avoid or minimize nutrition and growth deficits. The aims of our study were: 1) To determine how often G-tube was initiated in children and adolescents who were nutritionally at-risk (BMI below the 50th%ile) and 2) To assess the long-term impact of delayed Gtube placement on nutritional and pulmonary measures.",

For those patients treated at least once with a G-tube, we examined the association between G-tube delay (duration in years from when patient BMI initially fell below the 50th %ile to when patient received first G-tube placement) and each longitudinal outcome: annual percentile rate of change from baseline for BMI, height, weight and FEV1% predicted (for patients aged 6 years or older). We used population-averaged generalized estimating equations with covariate adjustment for confounders. Baseline age and outcome value were included in all models. Potential confounders included baseline and prior year values of each outcome, number of hospitalizations, age at CF diagnosis, age at baseline, number of \u2206F508 copies, sex, and socioeconomic status (measured as having state insurance). We also examined baseline and follow-up for Dornase alfa use, CF-related diabetes mellitus, pancreatic insufficiency, GERD, infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MRSA, and B. cepacia. Backwards elimination was used to identify significant covariates in regressions.Results: There were 6,906 patients who underwent G-tube placement at least once. Out of 22,722 patients who were at nutritional risk, 4,552 (20%) actually received G-tubes (2,354 patients did not meet inclusion criteria). In addition to previously identified predictors of FEV1, GERD was also statistically significant for this cohort. For height-for-age, patients with the shortest delay (< 1 year) had an average 0.42 (\u00b10.18)%ile/year (P=0.0171) greater annual rate of change for height-for-age compared to patients delayed 1-5 years and 0.86\u00b10.15%/year (P<0.0001) compared to patients delayed more than 5 years. Shortest delay (<1 year) corresponded to improvement in BMI %ile relative to intermediate (difference: 2.10\u00b10.68%, P=0.0019) and longest delays (difference: 3.64\u00b10.69%, P<0.0001). Weightfor-age %ile improved for patients with shortest delay compared to those patients waiting 1-5 years (difference: 1.98\u00b10.50%, P<0.0001) or more than 5 years (difference: 3.27\u00b10.48%, P<0.0001) for G-tube placement. There was no difference in FEV1 for patients who received G-tubes during the first year compared to those waiting 1-5 years for placement.Conclusions: Improved growth was observed in children and adolescents with CF who underwent more timely G-tube procedures. More work is needed to understand the impact of G-tube placement and GERD on lung function decline in CF patients with nutritional deficits. Background: Advancement in medical care for patients with CF has led to an increased life expectancy for the CF population. A growing number of women with CF are reaching reproductive age and having successful pregnancies. There are increased risks associated with pregnancy in this population, and concern remains regarding the effect that pregnancy in the woman with CF may have on maternal and infant health.",

Measures collected include age, BMI, FEV1, weight gain during pregnancy, preexisting CFRD, diagnosis of gestational diabetes, hospitalizations during pregnancy, need for IV antibiotic therapy, type of delivery, infant weight, gestational age, decision to breastfeed infant, and nutrition topics discussed during counseling with the CF dietitian.Results: Eighteen women in the study had 23 successful pregnancies. Mean pre-pregnancy BMI was 20.6 kg/m 2 with a mean weight gain of 26.2 lbs during pregnancy. Mean FEV1 was 81.7% for the 12 months prior to pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy weight and FEV1 were shown to be strong predictors of weight and FEV1 status postpartum. Interestingly, women with a BMI <22 had mean increase in BMI of 0.47 after pregnancy, compared to women with an initial BMI >22 who experienced a mean decrease in BMI of 1.46. Infant weight and gestational age did not differ based on maternal factors however there was a 40% rate of premature births, and 30% rate of low birth weight infants.Background: Vitamin D is well known for its importance in calcium absorption and bone mineralization. Appreciation for the role of vitamin D in health has recently expanded to include roles in immune function, cardiovascular health, and diabetes. Further, vitamin D status has been associated with improved survival in randomized controlled trials. It has also been recognized that individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D-related comorbidities such as low bone mineralization, CF-related diabetes and increased susceptibility to infection. In the CF population, vitamin D status has been positively correlated with lung function as measured by FEV 1 . In critically ill patients, vitamin D has been positively correlated with plasma concentrations of LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide. However, the clinical effects of vitamin D supplementation in CF subjects have not been studied in a randomized clinical trial.Objective: To evaluate the impact of a novel vitamin D repletion strategy on FEV 1 % predicted, LL-37 and mortality in a pilot study.Methods: We randomized 30 adults with CF admitted for pulmonary exacerbation to a single 250,000 IU dose of vitamin D 3 or placebo and measured serum 25(OH)D, LL-37 and FEV 1 %predicted at baseline, 1 week and 12 weeks after treatment. Clinical outcomes included return of FEV 1 %predicted to baseline and mortality at 12 months after randomization.Outcomes: We found the mean increase in serum 25(OH)D in the first week was 27(\u00b114) ng/mL in the vitamin D group and -0.69(\u00b16) ng/mL in the placebo group (p<0.001). Over the first week after randomization, plasma LL-37 increased in the vitamin D group by 60 ng/mL compared to a decrease of 29 ng/mL in the placebo group (p=0.10). The proportion of CF subjects that returned to >95% of their baseline FEV 1 %predicted was 73% in the vitamin D group and 38% in the placebo group (p=0.32). Survival analysis demonstrated that there was a trend towards an increase in the risk for death in the placebo group compared to the vitamin D group over a 12 month follow-up period (p=0.052).Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a single, large dose of vitamin D 3 rapidly restores vitamin D status in CF patients admitted with an acute pulmonary exacerbation. This pilot study also suggests that a rapid, high dose vitamin D supplementation strategy during pulmonary exacerbation may have important clinical effects, including improved lung function and survival. Larger studies need to be conducted to confirm these findings and to determine the potential mechanisms involved. Rationale: Adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) possess multiple potential risk factors for chronic kidney disease, including CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and lifetime nephrotoxic drug exposure.",

Chronic kidney disease (Stage 3 or greater) was defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL/min/1.73m 2 . Time-dependent multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether cumulative number of acute pulmonary exacerbations (surrogate for IV aminoglycoside exposure) and CFRD requiring insulin increase the risk of chronic kidney disease, adjusting for confounders.Main Results: The study cohort included 11,912 adults with a median follow-up of 4 years. During the study period, 204 subjects had chronic kidney disease, with an annual disease prevalence of 2.3%. Disease prevalence doubled with every 10-year increase in age. CFRD requiring insulin therapy substantially increased the risk of chronic kidney disease (1-4 years of CFRD requiring insulin versus no CFRD: HR=2.40, 95% CI 1.74-3.32; \u22655 years: HR=4.56, 95% CI 2.84-7.31). Pulmonary exacerbations did not significantly increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (1-5 exacerbations versus none: HR=0.79, 95% CI 0.56-1.11; 6-9 exacerbations: HR=0.92, 95% CI 0.58-1.46; \u226510 exacerbations: HR=1.16, 95% CI 0.75-1.81).Conclusions: CF-related diabetes is a significant risk factor for chronic kidney disease in adults with CF, but additional studies examining IV aminoglycoside exposure directly are required. Introduction: Non-adherence rates in children with chronic diseases has been shown to be as high as 50%(1). Cystic fibrosis treatment involves combining medication with physiotherapy and a high-fat diet. Due to its complexity, treatment can pose a significant challenge to both parents and children. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate non-adherence to cystic fibrosis management (digestive enzymes, vitamins and physiotherapy) in children in the UK and to examine factors associated with non-adherence.",

Non-adherence to therapies was measured using the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) self-report questionnaire, while necessity and concerns about treatments was explored using the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ). Both questionnaires were administered to parents/guardians and children aged 11 years or older. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised UK-English version (parents/guardians of children aged 6-13 years and children 6 years and older). Finally the Centre of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was administered to parents/guardians to assess depressive symptoms experienced.Results: To date, 70 children and their parents have been enrolled. Selfreported non-adherence varied with treatment type and participant (parent or child; Table1). Chi squared analysis on paired data revealed that children were significantly more likely to report non-adherence than parents for enzyme supplements (p<0.001), vitamins (p=0.01) and chest physiotherapy (p=0.051). Physiotherapy was considered the most necessary treatment whereas vitamins were considered least necessary. Nevertheless concerns were highest for chest physiotherapy and lowest for vitamins. Quality of life was generally reported to be high with children and adolescents reporting mean scores above 70% in all domains (except treatment for adolescents). Parents reported slightly lower mean quality of life scores for their children aged 6-13 years. Using the CES-D, 13.1% and 14.3% of parents reported symptoms indicative of mild and severe depression respectively.Conclusion: Children were more likely to report non-adherence than parents for all therapies. There was high necessity and low concern for therapies. Over a quarter of parents reported symptoms indicative of depression. Quality of life scores were generally high.Supported by the Research Forum for the Child (Queen's University Belfast).(1) Sabat\u00e9 E, Editor, Adherence to long-term therapies: evidence for action. WHO (2003) http://www.who.int/chronic_conditions/adherencereport/en/. Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are, like healthy children, at risk for developmental problems. Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis and symptoms (inattentive, hyperactive, impulsive) are prone to interfere with CF treatment. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the ADHD diagnostic process, its treatment and family experiences of living with two lifelong diagnoses.Method: Retrospective review of medical and psychological charts. Results: Twenty-one patients had suspicion of ADHD (Table) . Parents reported disruptive behavioral problems at home and school. This behavior was also reported during out-patient clinics. The subsequent diagnostic process included 1) a detailed behavioral history; 2) observation and testing of the child; and 3) reports from the pediatrician, school, home physiotherapist and other caregivers involved. Results were discussed with the CF team, the parents and child. When there was strong suspicion of ADHD, a referral to an ADHD specialist was made. The remaining patients were counselled and/or referred appropriately.Mean age at ADHD diagnosis was 6.75 (range 4-9). All 10 patients initially started ADHD medication, with good result for 8. By reaching adulthood, 3 patients had stopped ADHD medical treatment because they experienced no benefit.Follow-up of the pediatric patients included: three-monthly outpatient CF clinics and an annual follow-up with the ADHD specialist. The CF psychologist regularly contacted the family in between. Annual multidisciplinary meetings were organized for two children, because of additional problems (conduct disorder and learning difficulties). Follow-up for the adult patients included three-monthly CF follow-up, with support for ADHD when wanted.The combination of CF and ADHD was described as stressful and worrying. Parents noted that ADHD behavior strongly interfered with CF treatment. The ADHD medication was however frequently portrayed by both parents and physiotherapists as a relief: it helped to reduce disruptive behavior during CF treatment, e.g. problematic eating, incorrect use of the nebulizer or careless physiotherapy. The main concern with medical ADHD treatment was the potential impact on appetite and the extra burden of even more medication.Conclusion: In case of ADHD, CF treatment is often disrupted causing additional stress within families. The results show the importance of a multidisciplinary diagnostic process and the regular follow-up of both medical and psycho-social problems. Help has to be tailored to patients' needs and with consideration of the interaction between the 2 treatment modules.",

No changes in BMI, anxiety or depression total scores were found. Anxiety and depression levels were not related to lung function or BMI. No gender differences were found.When comparing patients with 'normal anxiety' with those with 'elevated anxiety,' it was found that patients from the 'normal' group had signifi-<80% and classified as non-adherent. Results indicated that CF patients were more adherent to Zithromax, an oral medication, than to inhaled medications. Several variables were related to rates of adherence. Children with CF were more adherent than adolescents or adults, and patients who were seen more often in clinic were more adherent. Children of caregivers who scored above the clinical cut-off score on an anxiety measure appeared to be less adherent, but the sample size was small. No correlations were observed between the MPRm and depression, FEV1, BMI, distance to the pulmonologist, gender, or co-morbid diabetes diagnosis. The MPRm represents an objective method to estimate medication adherence in CF patients and could potentially be used to both manage the individual patient at the point of care, and to track utility of interventions aimed at improving adherence.Acknowledgments: This study was supported by a grant from Southern California Kaiser Permanente.

Background: Parent adherence to the high-calorie diet prescribed to CF children during toddlerhood is critical for optimum health. Behavioral concerns common to the toddler stage of development present challenges, and parents concerned about CF nutrition guidelines often inadvertently encourage children not to eat. The current study pilots a developmentally sensitive adaptation of an existing evidence-based intervention (Stark, 2003) to provide parents of toddlers and preschool children with the nutrition and child behavior management strategies necessary to ensure adequate nutrition.",

All participants received the 8-week study intervention, a combined behavior and nutrition group counseling for parents focused on: 1) increasing calorie and fat intake, 2) ensuring appropriate dosage and timing of pancreatic enzymes, and 3) teaching effective parent management skills. All nutritional recommendations were individually generated in consultation with registered dietitians and physicians. This study employs a small-n, within-group changing criterion design and frequent data collection to demonstrate the causal relation between treatment and changes in caloric intake and behavior.Measures: Children's height and weight were collected at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow up. During the 8-week active study phase and follow up, parents completed 3-day diet diaries and videotaped one family meal per week. These tapes will be coded to assess parent and child behavior and child eating. Parents also completed the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS; Crist and Napier-Phillips, 2001).Results: Data are currently being collected and analyzed. Preliminary results from two families suggest this intervention improved the toddlers' nutrition. Parents of Ben, a 27-month-old Caucasian boy, increased his BMI percentile from the 26th to the 33rd from baseline to post-treatment and increased average weekly intake from 90% of RDA to 119%. Parents of Amie, a 26-month-old Caucasian girl whose diet featured high-sugar, lownutrient foods, improved the quality of the foods in her diet and helped her move from the 87th (overweight) to the 82nd percentile (healthy range). Parent reports on the BPFAS at all time points indicated their toddlers' behavior was normal; however, report of parent perceptions of children's problems decreased from pre-to post-treatment, suggesting parents viewed children's normal behavior as less problematic at post-treatment.Conclusions: A parent group intervention provides training in CF-specific child management skills to multiple families and may provide significant benefits to parents who often struggle with the demands of nutrition requirements and toddler behavior.References:Crist W. and Napier-Philips (2001) (CF) is a progressive disease affecting multiple organ systems including the lungs, pancreas and digestive. Currently, the treatment regimen is palliative and requires multiple medications and treatments, averaging 2-4 hours per day. Pain is a significant, but an under-studied complication of CF and may be related to disease progression, which can include chronic pulmonary infections, reduced lung function, and increased treatments, such as airway clearance and intravenous antibiotics. Although pain symptoms are a significant problem for children and adolescents with CF, there is little data on the frequency, intensity and location of their pain. The purpose of the current study is to systematically measure different aspects of pain and examine its relationship to adherence, depression, anxiety and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Methods: The current study is part of an ongoing multi-center NIH SBIR Phase II randomized, controlled trial. Enrollment is open, with a projected sample size of 150 participants ages 11-20. Participants complete a battery of measures during clinic visits including assessment of pain, HRQoL, adherence to prescribed medications, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants also complete an online pain diary for the six days following their clinic visit that assesses pain location, duration, intensity, affective ratings, and coping response. Data on two sibling participants were analyzed to illustrate the variations in pain experience among patients with CF.Results: Patient A (18 year-old Hispanic female) and Patient B (19 year-old Hispanic female) were seen at a CF clinic in South Florida and completed all measures including the online pain diary. Lung function was similar for both patients, at under FEV1% predicted of 70. Patient A reported no pain at the clinic visit and for the 6 subsequent days. In contrast, Patient B reported pain during her clinic visit and for 2 of the 6 days following her visit. Patient B's pain occurred in the stomach and was related to a gastrostomy tube. Mean pain duration lasted one hour. Affective ratings of pain included \"aching\" and \"pressure.\" Patient B also reported \"resting\" as a means of coping with her pain.Conclusions: The current study is the first comprehensive investigation of pain in children and adolescents with CF. The results illustrate the importance of assessing pain in this population on an individual basis. Two patients who were similar in age, gender, and lung function were compared, with data suggesting their pain experience was quite different. Although providers may assume that discomfort is \"temporary,\" it is clear that pain is a serious enduring challenge for these patients. Recent studies have alluded to pain ratings as the \"fifth vital sign,\" establishing its clinical relevance for routine care. In order to gain a better understanding of pain in this population, future analyses will include a larger sample with descriptive statistics assessing pain location, duration, frequency, and affective ratings. These results will be informative, both for assessment and treatment of pain in CF.Funding provided by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the American Psychological Association. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) primarily affects the lungs but may also affect other organs. This multi-organ involvement leads to secondary problems for people with CF. Recently an internal survey of children with CF demonstrated depression (72%), sleep difficulties (16%), anxiety (37%), and pain (29%). Yoga therapy has been shown to alleviate a variety of similar symptoms for other chronic diseases but has yet to be studied in children with CF.",

Subjects participated in six individual one-on-one sessions with a certified instructor who customized each class based on a pre-determined selection of yoga postures (asanas). Sessions occurred one week apart with each session lasting one hour. Questionnaires were administered prior to the first session and after the last session including: Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Memorial Symptoms Assessment Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for Children, and Additional Pain Symptoms and CF Behavioral Assessment. These questionnaires examined pain, sleep disturbance, sustained anxiety, and depression. In addition, immediately before and after each yoga session, subjects completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Children (STAIC) to assess for immediate anxiety. Cortisol levels were analyzed through saliva samples. A nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was used to compare mean/median values from questionnaires and cortisol levels. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate anxiety levels before and after each session as measured by STAIC. A two-sided p-value <0.05 was used for significance.Results: Twenty subjects were assessed including 12 females and 8 males with a median age of 11 (7-20) years. All subjects completed six sessions except for one subject who completed only five due to illness. Joint pain improved from a mean score of 3.25 to 3.65 on a scale of 1-4 with 4 indicating never having joint pain and 3 indicating sometimes having joint pain (p=0.033). Immediate anxiety scores decreased from a mean of 29 before each session to 23.6 after each session (p<0.001). The CFQ-R emotion subscale showed an improvement from 79.2 to 85 (p=0.073), and the respiratory subscale improved from 66.7 to 79.2 (p=0.076). All other questionnaire results and the cortisol analysis were insignificant.Participants expressed enjoyment and satisfaction and reported feeling \"relaxed\" and \"pleasant\" following the yoga sessions.Conclusion: Yoga may be an effective method for reducing immediate anxiety and joint pain in pediatric patients with CF. Further investigation is warranted with a larger trial evaluating whether yoga may be beneficial for other CF-related symptoms. Little is known about the emotional resources young children require to endure the intense treatment regimes of cystic fibrosis (CF).",

This is a novel study to capture the child's perspective using an established methodology.Objective: To explore if children's portrayal of processes in medical procedures with parents and their attachment status is associated with noncompliance to treatments.Methods: A trained researcher completed the Manchester Child Attachment Story Task (MCAST), an established measure of attachment status, and 6 stories from the MacArthur Story Stem Battery (MSSB), a standard play assessment of children's engagement with the challenge posed in the story and their parental representations. Three stories are specific to living with a chronic disease: The Dr's test, New Medicine and Day Out. Adherence was assessed using a \"pink card\" designed specifically for the study that records refusal of all treatments and a daily phone diary. Intelligence of child was controlled using draw-a-person and kinetic family diagram.Results: Ten boys and 10 girls aged between 3 and 9 years completed MSSB and MCAST. Associations between each of the three story stem groups and adherence will be examined using correlation coefficients, with appropriate measures for skewed distributions. Preliminary joint analyses of the three child representation variables in multiple linear regressions will be presented.Conclusions: The child's perspective is lacking in CF research and the MSSB may provide a unique insight into a young child's experience of living with CF. The MSSB may be a useful tool to predict non-compliance in young children and improve adherence to treatments. The awareness about a chronic progressive illness represents an event that destabilizes the personal and familiar prospects of life and asks parents for a revision of their internal working models about being a mother or a father and about their long-awaited child.",

Many elements can influence the possibility of adaptation; personal and environmental variables can affect it and can represent both a risk and a protective factor.Aims: Our study intends to evaluate the effect carried out by the presence of other healthy children in addition to a child with cystic fibrosis, on depression and anxiety levels of mothers. Specifically, the study wants to determine if the presence of a sick \"only child\" can have a risk role in the development of a depressive and anxious state in mothers.Methods: We administered HADS (The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale -Zigmond and Snaith,1983) and CES-D (The Centre of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale -Radloff, 1977) to 71 mothers of CF patients 0-18 age, followed at Florence CF Center, who were also chosen for TIDES, to evaluate depression and anxiety state.We recorded the presence or absence of healthy children in every single family. Thirty-six mothers have only one child. We applied the risk analysis (ODDS) to the resulted data. The analysis was made with the software Epi Info 3.5.1 Version.Results: From the risk analysis we found that the mothers with a single ill child have an anxiety ODDS 1.5 times bigger than the ODDS of the mothers with one or more healthy children in addition to the ill child. For the clinical depression, we found an ODDS reduced by 25% in mothers with a single ill child compared with mothers with one or more healthy children in addiction.Conclusion: Our study found that mothers of a single ill child have a higher risk of developing high anxiety levels. The risk of developing high level of depression is instead reduced in this group of mothers.The clinical interpretation of our results leads us to hypothesize different functions for the anxiety and depression responses to maintain the emotional equilibrium during the daily management of a child's disease. Rationale: High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is used to improve airway clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF), but has the lowest adherence of all treatments, \u2264 50% by patient self-report. When compared to data recorders self-report overestimates adherence. A novel data recorder was developed to monitor date, duration, and frequencies used during HFCWO therapy.",

We hypothesized that patients will perform less therapy than prescribed, will perform less as monitoring time progresses, children < 12 years will be most adherent, patients will be less adherent as prescribed time increases, patients and parents will report performing more therapy than actually performed, patients will overestimate therapy time more than parents, and more therapy time and better adherence will correlate with improved FEV1.Methods: Data was downloaded by technicians from data recorders during 3 home visits approximately 30 days apart (Blocks 1-3). Fourteenday recall was obtained at these visits for self-report assessment. FEV1 was measured from a valid spirometric effort and percent of predicted determined from NHANES standards. Adherence was (time recorded/time prescribed) x100. Self-report overestimation was ((Self-reported time-recorded time)/recorded time) x 100. Statistical analysis used 2-sample and paired ttest, ANOVA and linear regression.Results: Of 124 potential participants, 104 were enrolled and 51 currently have complete data. Overall mean adherence was 77% which was significantly higher than reported adherence in the literature (p<0.001). Mean daily minutes performed was 46. Adherence did not change significantly over the 3 month observation time. Patients <12 were 81% adherent compared to adults at 70% (p=0.6). Therapy time increased but adherence decreased significantly with increasing prescribed therapy time (112% at 30 min prescription vs 58% at >60 min prescription, p=0.01). Parents and patients overestimated by self-report similarly (31% vs 27%). FEV1 %predicted did not correlate with therapy time performed (p=0.31), but trended to correlate with adherence (p=0.07).Conclusion: In this single center study, patients were significantly more adherent to HFCWO airway clearance than rates reported in the literature. Adherence was consistent over time with no monitoring or representative visit effects seen. Therapy time increased with prescribed therapy time but adherence was highest in those prescribed less therapy time. Parents and patients overestimated by self-report to a similar extent. This monitoring device will be useful in trials to objectively determine HFCWO therapy time, adherence and effectiveness of interventions to improve adherence.Supported by grants from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Grant: MIKESE08B0 and Hill-Rom\u00ae.

Numerous studies have shown links between spirituality and coping, and between coping and health. We have previously shown that parents of children diagnosed with CF use spirituality to cope by making meaning of their experience. We hypothesized that adults would use spirituality differently when they were diagnosed later in life than would parents of a child diagnosed with CF.Methods: Qualitative study using Grounded Theory methods to analyze interviews of persons diagnosed with CF age 17 and above at this Center. A theoretical model of their experience emerged centered on a \"core dimension\" (the most fruitful explanation for the social process being examined) and \"primary dimensions\" (the means by which the core dimension proceeds). Demographic questions and questionnaires about religiosity and treatment intentions were completed by 7 participants.Results: Semi-structured interviews were completed with 12 of 25 eligible adults (n=9 female). Median age was 49 (range: 25-68) years; median age at diagnosis was 35.9 (range: 17-67) years. The core theoretical dimension is that after a CF diagnosis as an adult, most felt empowered, and positively reframed prior spiritual beliefs to understand how to care for their bodies. Primary dimensions included God wanting the body to be cared for; God's help was conditional upon prior good stewardship of one's body; and God's use of others to help with CF care, including physicians and researchers. Other adults found faith unhelpful even to the point of losing faith due to unanswered prayer. Participants were moderately spiritual and used religious coping more often for problem-solving than seeking comfort from the Divine or making meaning.Discussion: Adults in this sample were both similar to and different from parents of a child diagnosed with CF. Persons diagnosed as adults most commonly expressed relief; parents almost universally experienced their child's diagnosis as \"devastating.\" This sample of adults made a different use of religion, reframing beliefs in terms of the need to take good care of their bodies, rather than understanding their diagnosis as a divine calling, as did CF parents. Both expressed empowerment. Adults diagnosed late in life use spirituality differently than do parents of children with CF; clinicians may explore facilitating spirituality's role in coping and treatment adherence in this special population. has increased markedly over the past 10 years, with rates of adherence generally below 50%. Patients now spend 2 to 4 hours per day on CF care. A national adherence intervention, I Change Adherence and Raise Expectations (iCARE), aims to test a behavioral adherence intervention in 18 CF Centers. Prior research supports the efficacy of this problem-solving (PS) intervention when implemented by psychologists. iCARE seeks to evaluate PS when implemented by multidisciplinary CF team members (pulmonologists, nurses, respiratory therapists, dietitians, social workers). The current study examined treatment fidelity among these providers when implementing PS in their clinics.",

Prior to implementing, CAP sites received in-person training. The behavioral interventionist (BI) on the team conducts a PS session with the adolescent and parent to identify barriers to adherence and brainstorm solutions. The BI is instructed to video-tape the first session with each participant for supervision and coding of treatment fidelity. Treatment fidelity is rated on a scale of 0 to 8, with 8 indicating that all elements of the PS intervention were completed. Treatment fidelity is rated by 2 clinically trained PhD-level psychologists. Most PS sessions were coded independently, with a subset coded by both raters to achieve consensus.Results: To date, 168 PS sessions have been videotaped. Social workers have conducted the most sessions (n = 106), followed by nurses (n = 26), research coordinators (n = 23), physicians (n = 10), and dietitians (n = 3). PS sessions have been conducted by 30 different healthcare professionals across 11 sites implementing CAP. Social workers and nurses demonstrated the best treatment fidelity (M = 5.9, SD = 1.5; M = 5.9, SD = 1.0, respectively), followed by dietitians (M = 4.7, SD = 1.2), physicians (M = 4.6, SD = 1.0), and research coordinators (M = 4.2, SD = 1.2).Conclusions: Preliminary results indicated that PS can be disseminated to multidisciplinary CF team members for use in clinic settings. Preliminary results suggest that social workers and nurses are most skilled in doing PS. Note that the current rating system does not take into account the difficulty of each PS step. A more comprehensive rating system will be applied and associations between treatment fidelity and provider satisfaction will be determined.Funding was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Genentech, Inc., and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. aid/medication use in adults with CF and to assess the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on sleep disturbances.Methods: A cohort of 32 adult CF outpatients completed a list of sleep aids/medications and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at the start of the study and six weeks later. Sleep scores were calculated from the PSQI. Intervention after the second PSQI and medication survey included cognitive behavioral therapy and suggestions for improvements in sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioral therapy was explained by a doctor or nurse either in person or over the phone. Guidelines were also mailed to the patients. Participants completed a third PSQI and medication survey six weeks after the intervention. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. For continuous variables, measures of central tendency (e.g. mean, median) and standard deviation were provided. Proportions were used to describe poor sleep indicated by PSQI score of 6 or more. Paired comparisons, overall and among poor sleepers, were made between baseline, six weeks and post-intervention PSQI scores using the paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Use of medications was analyzed using the McNemar test on paired proportions.Results: Of the 32 patients included in the study, 16 were categorized as poor sleepers (50%) at baseline. Thirteen patients reported use of sleep medications (41%), among which 60% used two or more medications. Results from paired comparisons showed marginally lower PSQI scores post-intervention compared to baseline [average baseline PSQI score was 5.7 vs. 4.8 post-intervention; p = 0.095]. No differences in PSQI scores were observed comparing baseline vs. six weeks or six weeks vs. post-intervention. Among poor sleepers, significantly lower PSQI scores were observed post-intervention compared to baseline [average baseline PSQI score was 8.2 vs. 6.4 post-intervention; p = 0.029]. The use of sleep medications was less prevalent over time compared to baseline [29% at six weeks, 36% post-intervention vs. 43% at baseline], but not statistically significant. Use of medications among poor sleepers was also not significant at six weeks or post-intervention [44% at follow up vs. 75% at baseline; p = 0.12].Conclusion: Poor quality sleep is prevalent in CF, and is not related to the degree of clinical impairment. Although sleep aids are commonly used to help disturbed sleep, many have detrimental side effects, and may also be contributing to the sleep disturbance. Cognitive behavioral therapy had a significant effect on sleep quality among poor sleepers in adult CF patients.

This is considered a very high adherence rate for an inhalation therapy that is taken over long periods with a twice daily administration. A high percentage of patients had an adherence between 80 and 100%, which means they rarely missed an inhalation treatment. There was no trend for decreasing adherence during the study.Conclusion: The eFlow technology nebulizer with patient monitoring function provides key adherence data for clinical trial investigators allowing timely intervention as soon as non-adherence is detected. The high adherence rate in the inhaled L-CsA study indicates that treatment and handling of the eFlow technology nebulizer are well accepted for inclusion in daily care and treatment of lung transplant recipients.References:[1] Iacono, A. et al. (2006) , \"A randomized trial for inhaled cyclosporine in lung transplant recipients,\" NEJM, 354 (2) Introduction and Aims: Self-efficacy (SE) is the term used to describe how confident an individual feels about his/her ability to perform a given task. Families and caregivers of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) have a considerable responsibility in managing day-to-day therapies and recognising symptoms that may require intervention. It is important that they feel confident in their ability and empowered to undertake this role. We have adapted an established tool to assess SE for caregivers of children with CF (CF Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (CFSE-Q)), using a validated scale with an additional four questions pertaining to CF. We assessed the CFSE-Q in an exploratory trial in which SE was measured over two time points before and after the CF annual review. Half of the families were randomised to complete the Challenges of Living with CF Questionnaire (CLCF-Q), a parent reported outcome measure of treatment burden, with their annual review.Methods: Families were randomly allocated to Group 1 (intervention, the CLCF-Q) and Group 2 (control). Group 1 received verbal and written feedback on their CLCF-Q answers during the subsequent clinic appointment and were encouraged to discuss issues raised with members of the CF team. Participants completed the CFSE-Q at the beginning and end of the study. A higher score indicates better self-efficacy.Results: Thirty-seven participants were recruited (17 Group 1; 20 Group 2). The range of scores for baseline was 36-53 for Group 1 and 37-51 for Group 2. At the end of the study, Group 1 had a range of 38-52 and Group 2, 31-53. There were no floor or ceiling effects. The mean (SD) CFSE-Q scores for the control group was 44.9 (4.1) at the first time point and 43.0 (5.1) at the end of the study (paired students' t test, p<0.05). CFSE-Q scores in Group 1 remained stable (p= 0.48).Discussion: Group 2 received no intervention and we anticipated that self-efficacy scores would be stable. The reduction in SE score in this group was unexpected and may reflect their response to the annual review, which is often viewed as a stressful process. These early data suggest that the CFSE-Q is a valid measure of SE in this population. It may have a useful role in assessing parental coping abilities, but this needs further validation in larger studies. Objective: Following guidelines for chronic medications for maintenance of lung health can result in a complex treatment regimen that makes adherence challenging. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between prescribed CF regimens and an objective measure of treatment adherence.",

            "text": "Methods: Eighteen CF care centers provided the prescribed treatment regimen for 613 teens (age 14.4\u00b12.6 year; 47% male) enrolled in the iCARE study which required the teen be prescribed at least one drug listed in the Table. Families reported pharmacies used to obtain refills. Refill records were obtained from a national pharmacy switch company or direct from the pharmacy. A medication possession ratio (MPR) was calculated for each drug. An overall regimen MPR was calculated by averaging the drug MPR for each drug prescribed. A teen was considered to have a valid MPR for a drug if 1 of 2 criteria were met: a fill of any drug was found for all reported pharmacies OR a 60 day supply of a prescribed drug was obtained in the prior 6 months.Results: Almost 90% of teens were prescribed dornase alfa (DA) while approximately half were prescribed azithromycin (Az), hypertonic saline (HS) or inhaled tobramycin (IT) for chronic use. A total of 237 teens had a valid MPR for all their prescribed pulmonary medicines. MPRs were low for all drugs ranging from .33-.61 (Table) Overall, adherence to each drug and the regimen was suboptimal; moreover adherence to HS was lower than other drugs. We found that 26-40% of teens exhibited good adherence to a drug. Contrary to expectations, high regimen complexity was associated with better adherence perhaps reflecting care teams' hesitancy to add a new drug to regimens families already find challenging to follow. Interventions are needed to support adolescents' adherence to their complex regimens to ensure they achieve maximal health benefit.Supported by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Genentech, Inc., and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.",

Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA; 3. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Background: Developmental differences in disease severity and prescribed treatments are common in cystic fibrosis (CF). Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures, which evaluate the patient's perspective of how the disease affects daily functioning, should reflect these differences. The current study evaluated differences in HRQOL between school-age and adolescent patients in a randomized, controlled trial. We also evaluated associations between HRQOL domains, health outcomes, and treatments.Methods: CF Centers (N = 18) were randomized to the Comprehensive Adherence Program or Standard Care in Year 1. The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R; Quitter et al., 2005) was administered at Base-line (Child version: ages 11 to 13, Teen/Adult version: age 14 and older). Health variables and prescribed treatments (i.e., pulmonary medications, enzymes) were collected.Results: To date, 634 patients have been recruited; 514 patients (M = 14.5 years, SD = 2.6) completed the baseline assessment. Approximately half were female (54.7%), average FEV 1 % predicted was 85.2 (SD = 22.1), and average BMI percentile was 46.8 (SD = 26.8). As expected, children reported better HRQOL than adolescents on the Respiratory Symptoms and Treatment Burden scales (see Table) . In contrast, adolescents reported better HRQOL on the Social, Emotional, Eating, and Digestion scales. Respiratory Symptoms were positively associated with FEV 1 % predicted (r Child = .21, p < .01; r Teen/Adult = .24, p < .001); Weight scores for teen/adults were positively correlated with BMI percentile (r = .55, p < .001). Across ages, patients with more treatments reported worse Treatment Burden (r = -.14, p < .01).Conclusions: Important developmental differences between children and adolescents were found on several CFQ-R domains in this large, nationally-representative sample. Children reported more digestive symptoms and eating problems whereas adolescents had more respiratory symptoms and treatment burden. Modest associations were found between relevant CFQ-R domains and health outcomes. Patients with more treatments reported worse burden. Clinicians should consider patient burden when adding new treatments to the regimen.Funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Genentech, Inc., and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.",

University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments are a type of patient-reported outcome (PRO) that assess how a patient \"feels or functions\" with respect to his or her health across multiple domains (FDA, 2009 ). The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R; Quittner et al., 2005) is a disease-specific HRQOL measure used for both research and clinical purposes. Given that the development of the CFQ-R occurred over the past 9 years, during which treatment and long-term health outcomes for CF have changed, we initiated a new content validity study to ensure the relevance and validity of the items.Methods: Open-ended interviews were conducted with 66 participants: 18 children and 28 adolescents/adults with CF, and 20 parents of children with CF. Participants were recruited from 3 sites across the US and completed open-ended interviews about how CF affects their (or their child's) daily lives. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and content-analyzed using Atlas.ti, a software program for qualitative data analysis. Transcripts were coded for themes, including key symptoms of CF and the effects of CF on daily functioning. Across each group, the frequency of coded themes was analyzed to support content of each version of the CFQ-R.Results: Children ranged from 7 to 13 years (M = 9.89, SD = 1.81) and 38.90% were female. FEV 1 % predicted ranged from 41 to 107 (M = 85.37, SD = 19.09) and body mass index (BMI) percentile ranged from 7 to 93 (M = 50.50, SD = 29.80). Overall, 85 disease-related topics were mentioned by children during the open-ended interviews; 81 out of the 85 topics were mentioned by the first 11 children. Adolescents/adults ranged from 14 to 57 years (M = 22.20, SD = 13.90) and 60.70% were female. FEV 1 % predicted ranged from 27 to 119 (M = 73.00, SD = 28.21), BMI (n = 15) ranged from 16.10 to 26.80 (M = 21.75, SD = 3.00) and BMI percentile (n = 10) ranged from 3.0 to 55.0 (M = 22.20, SD = 13.90). Ninety-two disease-related topics were mentioned by adolescents/adults with CF, with 83 topics mentioned by the first 16 adults. Nineteen mothers and 1 father participated in the open-ended interviews. Ninety-five disease-related topics were mentioned, with 90 topics mentioned by the first 10 parents. Topics mentioned by a majority of respondents were represented by items on the CFQ-R.Conclusions: Open-ended interviews supported the content validity of the CFQ-R. Further, the impact of CF on a variety of areas of functioning demonstrated the importance of a multidimensional approach to assessing HRQOL, rather than a singular focus on symptoms. Future directions include expanding the Digestion Scale and developing items that assess sinus symptoms.Funding was provided by Behavioral Health Systems Research. Many new medication therapies have been developed for CF. However, these new medications can be very expensive for families. A recent study indicated that the cost of medication therapies is 39% of the total cost of medical management of a CF patient. Furthermore, some health insurance plans will not pay for them or will only pay a small portion resulting in an economic burden on the families.",

This study also evaluated the extent that costs of medication influenced the decision to skip the medication and subsequent health outcomes (BMI percentile and FEV1 % predicted).Methods: We recruited 165 adolescents and their caregivers (mean age =14.6\u00b12.7; range 11-20 years; 40% male; 89% Caucasian) from 18 CF care centers as part of a multi-site randomized trial. Participants completed a baseline assessment, which included measures of baseline demographics and out-of-pockets costs for CF medications. Baseline health outcome data included FEV1 % predicted and BMI percentile.Results: Preliminary results indicated that families reported spending an average of $140 \u00b1280 a year on outpatient medications and an overall annual deductible = $402\u00b11124; range = $0-5000. Out-of-pocket costs were associated with income (spearman's rho = 0.56; p <0.001), such that families with higher incomes had higher out-of-pockets costs. Costs by individual medication indicated that families spent the least per refill for azithromycin ($11\u00b120; n = 77) and the most for dornase alfa ($53\u00b1168; n = 136). Families on private insurance reported significantly higher out-ofpocket costs compared to families with public insurance [public insurance mean(SD) =0(0) and private insurance = 100(25); p = 0.001]. Ten percent of families reported that they skipped medications because of cost, and dornase alfa was reported as the most frequently skipped medication. There were no differences in the likelihood of skipping a medication by insurance type or payment amount. There were no significant differences in health outcomes (FEV1 % and BMI) by amount of out-of-pocket costs or reports of skipping medications.Conclusions: This study demonstrated that families report a wide range of out-of-pocket costs for medications that varies depending on medication, insurance status, and income. However, total out-of-pocket costs were not associated with the likelihood of skipping a medication or health outcomes. These findings suggest that the impact of out-of-pocket costs is best understood by examining the burden of these costs compared to household income. More research is needed to further understand the burden of out-ofpocket costs on medication adherence and family well being.Supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Genentech, Inc., and Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.",

Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Background: Recent research has shown elevated rates of depression among patients with cystic fibrosis. Depression has been associated with worse health related quality of life in adults. However, little is known about the impact of depression on medication adherence in adults.Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of depressive symptoms on medication adherence and subsequent health outcomes in older adolescent and adult patients with cystic fibrosis.Methods: We recruited 93 older adolescents and adults (mean age =29.2\u00b11.2; range 16-68 years; 53% male; 94% Caucasian) who are seen at the Johns Hopkins CF care centers and prescribed at least one of the following pulmonary medications for the past 12 months: azithromycin, dornase alfa, inhaled tobramycin, and hypertonic saline. Participants completed a baseline assessment that included measures of baseline demographics, the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D), and the Treatment Adherence Questionnaire-CF. Pulmonary medication adherence was measured using pharmacy refill records for the past 12 months and a composite medication possession ratio (MPR), calculated according to the participant's regimen. Baseline health outcome data included FEV1 % predicted (FEV1 %) and BMI.Results: Preliminary results indicated that 22% (n = 20) of enrolled participants endorsed depressive symptoms on the CES-D. Participants who screened positive for depressive symptoms had lower objective measures of adherence (p<0.01; see Table) . Furthermore, they self-reported significantly lower rates of adherence to airway clearance (p <0.01) and vitamins (p<0.001) and there was a trend for lower levels of exercise (p=0.06). There were no significant differences in health outcomes (FEV1 % and BMI) by depressive symptoms.Conclusions: This study demonstrated that over 20% of adults with CF endorse depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the presence of depressive symptoms impacted overall objective adherence to pulmonary medications and self-reported adherence to airway clearance and vitamins. These findings suggest that depression significantly impacts a patient's ability to adhere to prescribed therapies.Supported by NHLBI-HL087997. Background: Lung transplantation is an accepted treatment option for children with end stage lung disease. Cystic fibrosis is the most common indication for pediatric lung transplants. Some controversy exists regarding the benefit of lung transplantation in children with cystic fibrosis. Outcomes for transplantation traditionally have been defined by patient or graft survival. However, quality of life (QOL) is an important outcome when examining overall benefit of lung transplantation. Studies have shown improvement in overall and health related QOL after lung transplantation in adults, however little data exists for pediatric recipients.",

The modular system includes developmentally appropriate child report and parent report versions as well as generic and disease specific modules. Patients followed by our lung transplant center over the age of two years, pre-or post-transplant, were eligible for enrollment. Exclusion criteria were transition to adult care or death. Children over the age of five and parents of children over the age of two completed the PedsQLtrans-plant\u2122 and the PedsQL\u2122 generic modules at scheduled follow up. Wording on several items on the transplant module was modified to reflect pretransplant status when applicable. Scores were calculated by transforming responses into a 0-100 scale. Mean total scores for PedsQL\u2122 generic and PedsQLtransplant\u2122 were calculated for parent and child reports. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess differences in QOL between pretransplant and post-transplant patients.Data: Currently, thirty patients have been enrolled. Eight patients have pre-transplant data and 25 have post-transplant data. Mean scores and (SD) for the pre-transplant group were as follows: parent report PedsQL\u2122 50.4(10.2), child PedsQL\u2122 51.7(14.4), Parent PedsQLtransplant\u2122 66.5(11.6), and child PedsQLtranplant\u2122 69. 5(14.4) . Post-transplant scores were, in the same order for the modules 71.5(15.6), 75.7(14.7), 75.6(11.5), 78.9(14.9). The mean scores for the post-transplant group were higher than the means for the pre-transplant group in each module, and reached statistical significance in the parent and child reports for the PedsQL\u2122 (p=0.00, p=0.00). The difference in pre-and post-scores in PedsQLtransplant\u2122 parent reports trended toward significance (p=0.07).Conclusions: In this preliminary data analysis, quality of life in patients after lung transplantation is greater compared to that of children who are currently listed for transplant.

CF is one of the most common autosomal recessive genetic diseases in Europe caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene. Almost half (47.9%) of the Belgium patients are homozygous for F508del mutation. Studies on anxiety and depression usually include patients with CF with a wide variety of mutations. To avoid the potential influence of mutational differences, the present study includes only patients with the homozygous F508del mutation. The objective is to evaluate whether the prevalence of depression and anxiety in this specific group of patients is associated with welfare and lung function.Methods: This study is part of a representative multi-center national study of CF care in Belgium. A total of 119 non-transplanted adult patients with a homozygous F508del mutation participated (aged \u2265 18 years). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) was used to screen for anxiety and depression. The variable subjective welfare (SW) was used as a proxy measure of SES. Medical parameters included lung function (FEV1%predicted).Results: Anxiety and depression rates were equivalent to previous studies. A significant negative correlation was found between patients' (mean age 27.1 years, SD = 7.4, range 18-49) subjective welfare and symptoms of depression and anxiety (see Table) . This association became stronger with a decrease in lung function (mean FEV1%predicted: 66.9, SD = 22.2, and was highest for patients with severe impairment (< 40% FEV1%predicted). The association between SW and depression was not related to lung function.Conclusions: Socioeconomic status has an impact on the physical and psychological well-being of people. The complex interactions between SES and well-being may affect the clinical outcome of patients with CF. In future, indicators of SES, both subjective and objective, could be used to better understand the relationship between psychological and physical outcome in CF.Supported by the Belgian Patient Association (BSVM/ABLM).",

Department of Psychiatry, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study is to describe the mental health services within the National Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Centers in the United States. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation accredits centers and sets standards of multidisciplinary care to patients with CF. The CF Foundation collects data on depression in the CF Portal and provides guidelines for expected mental health services for each center. Recently the International Depression/Anxiety Epidemiological Study (TIDES) has reported an elevated prevalence of depression, anxiety compared to their peers. TIDES high-Background: Chronic pulmonary infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Infection control measures reduce the transmission of bacteria and hand hygiene plays a critical role in prevention of infection, particularly in the CF population. However, poor compliance with hand hygiene has been documented within hospitals. The objective of this quality improvement initiative was to improve hand hygiene practices in the inpatient respiratory unit by monitoring and engaging the patients in the process.Methods: The Hand Hygiene Committee developed and implemented the \"Show & Tell\" campaign to make hand hygiene a more transparent process in October 2009. The campaign requested staff to \"Show\" the patients that their hands are clean by performing hand hygiene in front of the patient, and/or to \"Tell\" the patient their hands are clean upon entering the room. All staff were educated on the campaign and \"Show & Tell\" signs were placed at the entrance of each patient's room. Monthly patient audits were performed to provide the unit with regular feedback on staff compliance. Patients were asked to record whether or not hand hygiene was performed by each hospital staff member that entered their room on a particular day. In addition, patients indicated the discipline of each health care team member they audited. Staff were unaware of the timing of the audits and did not know which patients were performing the audits.Results: Prior to initiating the \"Show & Tell\" campaign, 13% of patients were aware that hand hygiene had been performed. Between November 2009 and February 2011, a total of 65 patient audits were conducted. Patients witnessed a total of 683 health care team members over the study period. Direct patient observation of compliance with hand hygiene increased from 13% to 58%. When data were analyzed by health discipline, respiratory therapists and physiotherapists had the highest compliance with hand hygiene (96% and 92% compliance respectively). Physicians were noted to be compliant with hand hygiene 70% of the time. Research coordinators had low recorded compliance at 33%.",

            "text": "As part of a cystic fibrosis care center quality improvement initiative to make infection control practices uniform across all care areas, it was essential to reach a consensus on the specifics of these practices and then to formulate a plan to implement the practice changes. The adult CF clinic had already implemented \"contact isolation\" precautions. This had been implemented in a pulmonary clinic that uses the same space and has consistent nursing personnel. However, implementing the practice changes in the pediatric clinic was more difficult due to the variability in staff assigned and the number of clinics occurring at the same time. The changes also would be considered a slightly different approach to current infection control practices for clinic staff and CF care center staff.The object of this study was to assess our pediatric clinic staff members' knowledge of cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis outpatient infection control practices pre-and post-implementation of the proposed infection control practice changes. The method used was administration of on-line surveys. Surveys containing 20 questions to assess basic knowledge about cystic fibrosis and infection control procedures were sent to 28 pediatric speciality clinic staff: RNs, LPNs, clinic coordinators, medical assistants, before and after they were offered an educational in-service on the basics of CF.Results: Thirteen or 46% of 28 staff members completed pre-inservice surveys and percent of correct answers ranged from 20 to 100%. Seven of the 11 (64%) staff who attended the inservice returned surveys and percent of correct answers ranged from 60 to 100%. Improved scores for 14 of 20 questions were noted when pre-inservice respondents were compared to post-inservice respondents.Conclusion: On line surveys appear to be a good way to assess clinic staff's knowledge about CF in a busy pediatric subspecialty clinic. The pediatric clinic staff seemed overall to benefit from the inservice on cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis infection control. Infection control practices, similar to those previously utilized in the adult Pulmonary/CF clinic have now begun to be implemented with good cooperation of the Pediatric clinic and team staff. Future studies could analyze the effectiveness of infection control practices in minimizing exposure to microorganisms through random cultures of clinic surfaces that should be disinfected. Alternately, clinics could survey parents/patients on observed staff's adherence with recommended infection control practices. Barnico, K.; Sullivan, K.; McGeachey, A.; Sawicki, G.S. Division of Respiratory Diseases, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA Objective: To optimize care for our CF patients via coordination of PICC placement prior to admission to decrease length of hospitalization, Cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations unresponsive to oral and/or inhaled antibiotics require therapy with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. A prolonged inpatient admission can be a burden in the form of absence from school/work, change in the quality of daily life, and missed wages for CF patients and/or family members, in addition to costs of the hospitalization itself. Recent studies suggest that CF pulmonary exacerbations can be managed effectively in the home setting. A challenge for optimal management of home IV therapy in large CF centers with multiple CF physicians is coordination of communication with multiple home health agencies that are remote to the CF Center.",

Most pediatric CF patients are hospitalized for 4-6 days for initiation of IV antibiotics, then discharged when IV antibiotic doses are optimized through pharmacokinetic studies. Subsequent bloodwork to monitor for potential drug toxicities and pharmacokinetic studies are performed by the home health agencies with results directed to the CFCHC for interpretation by the primary CF physician and the inpatient pharmacist. The CFCHC serves as the primary support person for all patients/families receiving home IV services and assists in resolving all complications related to home IV therapy including but not limited to infected/clotted CVAD, IV medication discrepancies, lab errors or critical values, adverse reactions to therapy, potential acute renal failure or questions or concerns from home care companies, patients or families.Results: Since initiating this QI project in August 2008, the CFCHC has established ongoing communication and education about CF with 17 home infusion companies, 34 home nursing agencies and 5 regional health centers across the state. The number of home IV therapies per year has increased from 66 in 2009 to 142 in 2010. By closely monitoring the patient's home labs a minimum of once weekly, there have been no documented cases of drug toxicity or acute renal failure and only 15% of patients have had to have adjustments made to their home IV regimen. There have been 7 documented CVAD infections and 5 CVAD had to be removed or replaced after unsuccessful attempts to declot. By using a community-based resource with whom the CFCHC has established a working relationship, most issues have been resolved in the patient's home community.Conclusion: Establishing a single point person to convey communication between the CF Center and community-based resources across the state has optimized delivery of home IV antibiotic therapy to our CF patients. Introduction: Formal education for children around CF care does not always occur as education is directed to parents at time of diagnosis, when infants or young children are too young to receive this education. We decided that a formal education process should be developed for patients over 10 years of age. In order to assess our patients' education needs, a questionnaire was developed by CF clinic staff. The project was approved by the quality improvement team at SickKids.Methods: The 14 item questionnaire incorporated questions addressing nutrition, physiotherapy, exercise and general CF knowledge. Most answers were presented in a multiple choice format, or with responses of Yes or No. One open-ended question asked what the patients would like to know about their CF. Patients between the ages of 10 to 12 years were identified using the CF database and during weekly pre-clinic reviews. Questionnaires were handed out during clinic visits or hospital admissions.Results: Thirty-seven patients (n= 18 boys) responded out of 49 (76%) identified. Nutrition: The majority of patients responded correctly on why they should gain weight and eat well. Four patients (10 %) were not sure which foods were high in energy or why they were taking vitamins. Most patients (92%) understood the consequences of not taking enzymes. Physiotherapy and Exercise: The majority (89 %) of patients knew that they did physiotherapy (airway clearance techniques) to move mucous out of the airways, and more than half (59%) knew that it helped to keep their lungs healthy but very few (13.5%) were aware that it helped increase blood oxygen levels. The majority of patients knew that exercise (86.5%) and sports (81%) helped keep their lungs healthy and very few patients thought that CF limited their sport participation. Surprisingly, 35% of patients thought that they lose less salt when they sweat during exercise. Medication: The majority (81%) of patients thought they knew the names of their medications, how to properly take nebulized medications and how to clean their nebulizer after each use (79%). General CF: The majority (81%) of patients knew that the mucous in their lungs was thicker but fewer (32%) were aware that they can get different bacteria in their lungs. Many patients had questions around mortality and their future, suggesting that these issues were on their mind, and that they would like them addressed.Conclusions: We learned from results of this questionnaire that while most patients in this age group had good knowledge about nutrition and CF and their medications, why they do physiotherapy and that physical activity helps to keep their lungs healthy, some patients did require more education around their CF care. Our next step is to design educational materials that provide information for patients on the important aspects of their CF care, and prepare a formal education plan during routine clinic visits for patients who are 10 years of age and older. We will also address the difficult questions patients had posed about their mortality, and their future as it relates to their CF. Results: Survey response rates varied from 70% to 93%. Mean age at baseline was 33 yrs (range 19-64), and mean FEV1 % predicted was 59.8% (SD 22%). Over 40 months, some HRQOL domains (health perceptions, vitality, emotional functioning, concerns for the future) exhibited negative quadratic change, while other HRQOL domains (role functioning, interpersonal relationships) exhibited negative linear change. FEV1 was positively related to initial HRQOL, and exacerbation number was negatively related to HRQOL. Individuals with B. cepacia complex reported significantly greater concerns for the future at baseline, and they exhibited a greater decline in health perceptions, vitality, and role functioning over time. Individuals having a greater sense of meaning and peace in their lives reported a greater level of health perceptions, vitality, physical functioning, role functioning, interpersonal relationships, and emotional functioning at baseline, as well as fewer concerns for the future. Using optimistic coping strategies was associated with a higher level of emotional functioning and fewer concerns for the future at baseline. Conversely, individuals using distraction as a coping mechanism reported decreased health perceptions, role functioning, interpersonal relationships, and emotional functioning at baseline, and they reported greater concerns for the future.",

Psychosocial variables such as having meaning and peace, or coping strategy, were also significantly correlated with various HRQOL domains. A steady but small decline in role functioning and interpersonal relationships was observed over a 40 month period. For other HRQOL domains (health perceptions, vitality, emotional functioning, concerns for the future), we found an increase in HRQOL for the first 26 months of the study and a decrease in HRQOL after that time. We have previously shown that ward nurses can become more emotionally involved with CF patients compared to others and that they struggle with nurse-patient relationship boundaries (Govin et al J of CF 2003:2; P269). The rapid expansion of the numbers of adult CF patients who require inpatient care, coupled with the advent of social networking sites such as \"Facebook\" and \"Twitter,\" has increased the exposure of ward based healthcare workers to relationship boundary challenges: in small education groups staff reported that they are using Facebook and texting to socialise with patients.Methods: To look at these issues further, we devised 20 staff-patient interaction scenarios including \"crying with a patient,\" \"having a romantic relationship with a patient,\" and \"being friends on a social networking site.\" Using a structured questionnaire, we asked 35 nurses and 5 physiotherapists (all female, 14 = age 18 to 25 years, 13 = 26 to 34, 7 = 35 to 44, 5 = 45 to 54, and 1 > 54) working with CF inpatients to comment on their approach to these, and whether such contact would be unprofessional.Results: Five (12.5%) would attend a personal social function: although all 40 (100%) thought it unprofessional to drink alcohol in the patient's presence, 2 (5%) thought it acceptable to smoke in the same scenario. Although none would text a patient, 17 (37.5%) would send a greetings card, 2 (5%) would make a personal arrangement to go out for the day, and 1 (2.5%) thought it acceptable to be a patient's Facebook friend. Thirtyseven (92.5%) said it was acceptable to hold a patient's hand to provide comfort, and 8 (20%) thought it acceptable to visit a patient in hospital on an 'off-duty' day. Although all stated it was unacceptable to visit a patient at their home when off duty and 39 (97.5%) thought it unprofessional to socialise with a patient outside the workplace, one (2.5%) said it was acceptable to have a romantic relationship with a patient. All thought it unacceptable to talk about one patient's situation with another patient but 36 (90%) would disclose their own personal information to a patient.",

The delivery of aerosol medications is integral for the maintenance of lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The usual daily regimen includes twice daily aerosolized therapies taking approximately four to six hours. The total time incorporates preparation, nebulization,and cleaning of all equipment used for these treatments. This treatment burden impacts patient adherence to necessary therapies and the overall quality of life. Time has been a resounding theme amongst adult CF patients when discussing the adherence to maintenance therapies. Allowing more time for patients to enjoy daily activities while balancing appropriate drug delivery is a central goal for all CF patients. The aim of this project was to assess the patient experience with this compressor. Based on its operating pressure and durability the Mobilaire compressor was ordered for several of our CF patients. The Mobilaire compressor is a 50 PSI compressor that can be used in the delivery of aerosolized treatments. The aim of this study was to describe patient experiences with this compressor.",

A total of 23 patients were asked to complete the survey in the study. The patient satisfaction survey was distributed in clinic to all CF patients that were using the Mobilaire compressor. The questions asked were related to the advantages or disadvantages of the Mobilaire with respect to time, ease of use, noise level, cost, sturdiness, and the effect on cough and sputum production.Results: A total of 23 patients completed (100%) the survey. There were 9 (39%) men and 16 (69%) women with an average age of 27 years (range 18-54). Eighteen patients (78%) noted the compressor reduced the time of aerosol treatments. Sixteen patients (70%) noted the compressor to be easy to operate. Fifteen patients (65%) found the compressor to be sturdy and durable. Twelve patients (52%) noted that they had an increase in cough and sputum production after their aerosol treatment using the Mobilaire. Ten patients (43%) felt the cost to purchase the compressor and the volume of noise emanating from the device were found to be the predominant negative features.Conclusion: CF patients expressed a positive response to the use of the Mobilaire compressor. Patients were able to reduce the time for the aerosol treatment and expressed the ease of use of the compressor to do their treatments. Unfortunately, the Mobilaire compressor is not considered the standard durable medical device for CF patients. The cost of the Mobilaire compressor is $250.00 and is not covered by state aid insurance. Most insurance carriers cover the standard CF compressor, the Pari Vios at a cost of $50.12 (a difference of $199.88). This may pose an additional financial burden to the healthcare dollars already spent by CF patients. In further analysis, we will study the potential benefit of the additional cost of the Mobilaire on the pulmonary status of CF patients such as drug delivery, pulmonary exacerbations, and annual FEV1 trends. A goal of the Riley Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Center is successful transition to adult care for all individuals. Late in 2010, the Riley CF team began to examine the preparation process for transition. A standardized education program for the school age child with cystic fibrosis was developed and is being implemented with a multi-disciplinary approach. Program evaluation is planned for the fourth quarter of 2011.",

            "text": "Twenty-five children, 8-12 years old, were surveyed regarding their understanding of cystic fibrosis. Based upon the results, our center developed a structured education plan related to CF care of the school age individual. The program goal is to increase the child's knowledge of cystic fibrosis and care regimen. Topics include: definition of cystic fibrosis, nutrition, respiratory care/management, respiratory culture, and medications. The education is provided by a CF team member during an annual or scheduled visit. More than one visit may be required to discuss all topics. An educational session includes an opportunity (5-10 minutes) for questions from the child and their family. Visual tools were developed by CF team members and are utilized during the educational session(s). The visual tools are provided to the child to help reinforce the teaching. Visual tools include: What is Cystic Fibrosis?Love Me Nutrition Education Module Order of Therapy Airway Clearance Respiratory Cultures Dornase Alfa Pancreatic Enzymes Quick Relief Bronchodilator Azithromycin Hypertonic Saline Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Aztreonam Evaluative data will be collected via survey during the fourth quarter of 2011. Post-education evaluation goals will indicate that individuals have an enhanced understanding of cystic fibrosis, awareness of prescribed medications, increased understanding of respiratory care regimen, and awareness of nutrition importance. Data will be analyzed and may initiate changes to the standardized education program for the school age child. Successful completion of program goals will facilitate an enhanced understanding of cystic fibrosis and care requirements which will benefit the transition outcome. Introduction: In this study we describe and discuss the way we daily act in remote telematic tracking of CF outpatients, a procedure which has been improved through our daily experience in telehomecare.",

            "text": "Materials and Methods: Currently, there are almost 30 patients involved in our telehomecare project, using Vivitel home medical equipment (www.vivisol.com). Through this, we are able to collect data about patient's spirometry, pulse oximetry and heart frequency directly from their home, and also transfer related data by phone.We describe in detail the operational proceeding of telemonitoring activity, diagnostic procedure and therapeutic measures.We describe and discuss intervention parameters and the way we manage a register of performances in spreadsheet format, that allows us to automatically obtain a monthly overview of activities, a tracking of the interventions in loco on the medical equipment and of any critical issues arising during the procedure.We also describe the training program for the patients and their families on the proper use of the medical equipment carried on by the staff of the center and the procedures through which we maintain contacts with patients and Vivisol assistance, and also the periodic satisfaction surveys, sent by email.Results: From February 15, 2010 to May 25, 2011 we received 809 transmissions (1226 spirometry and 288 pulse oximetry).The mean compliance (transmissions/patient day)was 8.9%. We established a contact 699 times (80.9%). Over 494 calls, normally by cell phone, 68% were successful at first attempt; in remaining cases patients were contacted later. From June 2010 we recalled 18 patients into the hospital following transmissions.Discussion: We analyze the 2010 -2011 data. We discuss the compliance of patients toward Telehomecare, the efficacy of cell phone in establishing contact with patients and the relevancy of symptom rescue in diagnosing the pulmonary relapse episodes.We discuss medico-legal aspects of telemedicine activity, in the light of standards and legislation, including issues related to the processing of privacy and security data.We discuss the professional team needs and requirements, dedicated to the activities of telemedicine and procedures related to clinical risk management.They indicated that having a visual image aided in their understanding of pancreatic insufficiency and the importance of proper enzyme administration. This education resource will continue to be used at our center, in addition to verbal and written education, with families of newly diagnosed patients, elementary school age pediatric patients, and as needed with any patient or family member requiring or requesting more information about CF nutrition. Objective: The multi-disciplinary team ran a Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Teaching Day for families of patients in October 2010. A Knowledge Assessment Questionnaire (KAQ) and evaluation were designed to help determine the best approach to effective and interactive delivery of information.",

            "text": "Methods: Presentations by the multi-disciplinary CF team, Ability Online\u2122 and Cystic Fibrosis Canada were made. The KAQ was completed before the presentations and at the end of the day. Program evaluation was undertaken to understand the relevance of presented material, education strategies employed and learning outcomes for participants. Ninety adults attended. Data were collected on-site and analysis of the pre-and post-KAQ and evaluation were conducted. The KAQ addressed specific topics related to CF patient care. The evaluation assessed overall satisfaction of the teaching day. Results from both were analyzed and summarized.Results: Response rate for the assessment tool was 57% (pre) and 41% (post) and program evaluation was 62 %. There was an improved understanding of the disease process and interventions available for CF demonstrated in the post-KAQ. Post-teaching, 61% more respondents were able to list Haemophilus influenza and 34% more listed Staphylococcus aureus as common bacteria found in CF. Understanding of nutrition and gastrointestinal system-related issues included a 50% increase in being able to suggest ways to boost growth and 64% increase in recognizing the need for a high fat diet. Participants demonstrated improved knowledge of airway clearance techniques, PEP (34 % increase) and VEST (13% increase). There was also a 23% increase in understanding of inflammation and infection in the lungs of the child with CF. The evaluations revealed a high satisfaction with the teaching day with 10 describing it as surpassing their expectations. Suggestions for future topics included: potential new clinical drug trials (n=9), diabetes education (n=3) and ideas to perform treatments with an uncooperative child (n=2). Areas of improvement included having a bigger venue and holding teaching days more frequently.Conclusions: Results of the KAQ and evaluation revealed improved knowledge and overall satisfaction. Suggestions include a session on genetics, projections for the future, and allowing submission of questions prior to the teaching day. Teaching days provide CF families with increased knowledge and understanding of the disease process, possibly leading to improved adherence. This setting also allowed parents to socialize and establish friendships for support. It provided access to resources for all participants. In order to improve the response rate, an incentive should be considered.Practical Implications: Measuring the effectiveness of this teaching day is useful for staff and participants. Staff of CF centers considering running a teaching day can see that participants benefit with increased knowledge, satisfaction with the process and a chance to meet other families for support. At the recommendation of the CFF, most CF centers have incorporated parents/patients' voices to optimize care. Often this takes the form of Par-ent/Patient Advisory Boards. We present another option to engage families in the care they receive.",

            "text": "Our CF center is comprised of approximately 170 pediatric and 130 adult patients, followed at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and Froedtert Hospital by two separate CF teams. Both teams meet weekly to collaborate on patient care issues, develop newsletters and CF Education night programs.Within the context of LLC II participation, we launched a series of CF Education programs to educate families on changes in care that would be provided at their clinic visits. The programs included information on the basics of CF, clinical treatments and therapies, aiming the information at specific age groups: Infants/toddlers; School-age; Adolescents/Adults. These programs were held on Saturdays with < 20 attendees. Using feedback from families, future events were scheduled on weeknights for 2-3 hours including families as well as teens and adults with CF.Since 2006, 16 CF Education Nights have been very successfully implemented between our adult and pediatric CF Centers. Program topics have been both educational (Reproduction, Nutrition, At the Sinus Disease, etc.) and motivational (CF Research with Dr. Beall, Isabel Stenzel, Jerry Cahill). At the beginning of each education night, CF vendors display their products and educational materials and interact with families. Dinner is also provided. The CF Center Staff uses this opportunity to help families network with other CF families, and solicit feedback on the program. Most programs feature a parent-patient panel with a moderator who targets questions to reinforce program messages and encourage a connection with real-life experiences. Attendance averages 88 per session.A key reason our CF programs have been so successful has been the personal invitation and expectation that our families and people with CF will attend these events. About 1-2 weeks before the event, those who have not responded to our invitation receive a personal phone call or email. For those who live too far away or have other commitments, the Education Nights are recorded and DVDs are distributed following the events. We have a library of previous programs for families who would benefit from that information at a later time.Additional suggestions for Education Nights: 1. Aim for at least 3 programs a year. 2. Once patients come to a few of the events, they become regular attendees 3. Encourage diverse staff to attend 4. Use these events as a strategy to announce changes in the center 5. Find guest speakers to reinforce key CF care messages 6. Try to balance medicine/science presentations with personal stories 7. Have tissues, hand cleanser for infection control; seat participants at least 3 feet from each other 8. Develop an evaluation tool to solicit ideas for future program topics and assess the current program Launching a successful CF Education Night series can be daunting, yet very rewarding for both CF staff and families. Consider these types of programs to supplement family advisory boards.",
