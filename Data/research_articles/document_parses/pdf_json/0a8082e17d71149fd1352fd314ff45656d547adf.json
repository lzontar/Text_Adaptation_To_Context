Saliva can be used for the direct detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the quantification of the specific immunoglobulins produced against it, and for the evaluation of the non-specific, innate immune response of the patient. Moreover, a deeper knowledge of potential changes in the saliva proteome in this disease may allow the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, or even help our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the disease. With the development of appropriate sample collection and processing methods and the use of adequate assays, saliva can provide useful clinical information about the disease and could be potentially included in guidelines for sample collection for the diagnosis, disease management, and control of Covid-19.",

Although its mechanism of infection is still not known, it has affinity for and replicates in cells located in the lower airways. The most characteristic clinical sign is the production of a respiratory distress syndrome that can range from mild malaise to death, having worse prognosis in elderly patients with comorbidities [1] .

It is an integrated mixture of secretions of the different salivary glands, desquamated oral epithelial cells, gingival crevicular fluid, and different microorganisms [3] . It also contains a large number of proteins such as immunoglobulins, mucins, and enzymes, as well as metabolites, hormones, and electrolytes. This composition allows the detection of pathogens in saliva and also the quantification of biomarkers that can provide information about the immunological, inflammatory, endocrine, and metabolic status of the individual. In some cases, its value to detect physiological changes is similar or superior to serum, such as for the detection of acute stress by alpha-amylase or cortisol [4] . Overall, saliva appears to be a fluid of enormous potential in health assessment, especially due to the clinical information that it can provide and the non-invasive nature of its collection, which can be performed by individuals without particular training and with no major requirements in terms of equipment or facilities.",

In addition, in cases of thrombocytopenia or any other coagulation disorder, this procedure can cause bleeding. These drawbacks can limit the use of swabs, especially in serial monitoring or mass test programs. Sputum has been also proposed as a non-invasive lower respiratory tract specimen, but 72% of Covid-19 patients were not able to produce it for collection [9] . The difficulty of obtaining sputum also has been described in SARS-CoV, a virus with many similarities with the Covid-2019, especially at early stages of infection, when no cough or only dry cough is present [10] .

In addition, saliva tested negative in 33 patients from whom nasopharyngeal specimens were negative for SARS-Cov-2. The detection of the virus was by a real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and the range of values was from 9.9 \u00d7 10 2 copies/mL to 1.2 \u00d7 10 8 copies/mL. -Azzi et al. [14] collected saliva through passive drool. In cases of patients who were undergoing endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the collection was performed intraorally by a physician with the use of a pipette. These specimens possibly also contained respiratory secretions. In these conditions, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all saliva samples collected from a group of 25 patients with severe to very severe disease, who were diagnosed by detection of the virus in pharyngeal or bronchoalveolar swabs. An rRT-PCR that detected a trend in viral load without quantification of the viral copies per millimeter, was used for virus detection.",

In this program, saliva samples are collected between two and six weeks after the onset of symptoms and tested for virus specific IgM. The assays used have been shown to be greater than 90% sensitive and specific [25] . It could be expected that saliva will have similar value in Covid-19 diagnosis and monitoring. This is particularly interesting for two main reasons: (1) as long as there is no effective treatment or vaccine and person-to-person transmission has to be minimized, the possibility of identifying immune individuals will be invaluable in defining who and how particular individuals can be relieved from confinement and limited social contact; (2) there is a lot to establish and understand about immunity dynamics during the disease, and how long it remains after the individual has recovered [29] .",
