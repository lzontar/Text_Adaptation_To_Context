Although AMR was already spreading rapidly before the emergence of COVID-19 4 , the impact of the pandemic may be more pronounced in low-and-middleincome countries (LMICs) due to the lack of antimicrobial stewardship, limited clinical microbiology capacity, and poorly regulated access to antibiotics amongst the many other challenges faced by health systems in LMICs. 5 The prevalence of resistant bacterial strains is higher in mobile populations such as travellers, migrants and refugees, who may be carriers for months after returning home. 6, 7 Amongst them are groups of vulnerable people who are disproportionately at risks to COVID-19, putting them at higher risks of complications if they experience secondary bacterial infections. 8 ",

WHO issued guidance to discourage antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, or patients with suspected or confirmed moderate COVID-19 illness unless there is a clinical indication of a bacterial infection. 9 A multipronged strategy is necessary to support WHO's effort in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on the increasing trend in global AMR. First, prospective studies on COVID-19 coinfections and superinfections are needed to inform appropriate antimicrobial treatment and stewardship strategies. Second, transparent monitoring and reporting of antibiotic resistance patterns in COVID-19 intensive care units should be urgently established to help guide the proper use of antibiotics. Third, a globally coordinated effort in establishing a framework of governance,surveillance and reporting of AMR is needed to strengthen the fight against AMR during and in the aftermath of COVID-19.5 One lesson that COVID-19 has taught the world is that global efforts, political commitment at the national level, and collaborations across the",
