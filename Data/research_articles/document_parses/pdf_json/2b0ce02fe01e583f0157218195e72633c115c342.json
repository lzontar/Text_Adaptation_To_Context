Of note, an antiinfection effect of heparin has been reported for SARS-CoV. 9 One study confirmed that HS proteoglycan binds to coronavirus spike protein, which normally mediates binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor 10 . Furthermore, Mycroft-West and colleagues 11 recently reported that COVID-19 spike protein S1 receptor-binding domain binds to heparin and induces F I G U R E 1 Function of heparan sulfate (HS) and HS proteoglycan. HS proteoglycan (HSPG) consists of a core protein and HS polysaccharide chains. The core protein contains a transmembrane domain that presents HS on the cell surface. Some HSPGs are present in the extracellular matrix. HS chains interact with antithrombin to interact with factor Xa (FXa) or factor IIa (FIIa) to regulate coagulation. These chains also bind to chemokines that recruit leukocytes to participate in inflammation. Many viruses bind to HS on host cell surfaces as the initial step to establishing infection. inhibiting initial infection or spread from infected to noninfected cells. In addition, extracellular HS proteoglycans also bind to viral proteins through the HS side chains and potentially serve as a barrier to prevent the viral particle from binding to HS proteoglycans and cell receptors on the host cells. 12 ",

Although the molecular mechanism for this benefit is not understood, it seems likely that the anti-inflammatory effects of heparin are contributory.

By comparison, a similar synthesis using a purely chemical approach requires 50 synthetic steps with an overall yield < 0.1%. 26, 27 The chemoenzymatic synthesis method is now able to produce an unprecedented large oligosaccharide library, providing a potentially unique opportunity to investigate the use of HS to treat severe inflammatory disorders including, perhaps, SARS-CoV-2 infection. 28 One critical advantage of the chemoenzymatic synthetic approach is to the ability to perform structural optimization for a specific biological function. A set of similar but subtly different oligosaccharides can be synthesized and then subjected to the relevant biological tests for efficacy. One successful example was accomplished by our research team to prepare a fully synthetic version of heparin as a substitute for animal-source heparin to improve the safety and reliability of heparin supply chains in the United States and around the globe. 27, 29 The synthetic approach was next used to synthesize different LMWH constructs, that is, HS 6-mer and HS 12-mer 30 (Figure 2A ).

In a recent study, we demonstrated that a synthetic nonanticoagulant HS 18-mer (Figure 2A) protects against acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in a mouse model. 15 It appears that the HS 18-mer neutralizes the proinflammatory activity of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, thereby attenuating the amplification of liver injury caused by an overly exuberant host immune response. Interestingly, we found that anticoagulant HS 18-mer did not possess the hepatoprotective effect in the same model, suggesting that anticoagulant activity and anti-inflammatory activity are separable properties. In the ischemia-reperfusion liver injury animal model, another sterile inflammation model mediated by HMGB1, 16 we also tested the protective effect of various synthetic HS oligosaccharides. Unexpectedly, we discovered that an anticoagulant HS 12-mer (Figure 2) displayed greater hepatoprotection than a nonanticoagulant 12-mer. 17 In sum, the data suggest that both anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory activities of HS are required to protect against liver injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion. Some severe COVID-19 patients reportedly develop coagulopathy and manifest a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like syndrome. 1 Administration of LMWH attenuates end-organ damage in a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DIC murine model. 18 However, in a randomized clinical trial, unfractionated heparin did not improve survival in patients with sepsis. 19 A novel concept to target proinflammatory proteins using nonanticoagulant heparin has been proposed by Wildhagen and colleagues. 20 Administration of LPS induces a systemic inflammatory response, mimicking a critical part of the complex pathology associated with sepsis and DIC. 21 Neutrophils or injured cells release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including histones and HMGB1, into the extracellular space and the systemic circulation, triggering the release of an array of proinflammatory cytokines. 22-24 Some severely affected COVID-19 patients have manifest a lethal complication known as the \"cytokine storm.\" 25 In an uncontrolled retrospective study, Tang and colleagues 1 recently",

The structural complexity of existing forms of unfractionated heparin and LMWH complicates mechanistic studies.
