But, as human migration patterns evolve, we expect to see more TB cases in higher income as well as temperate countries, and rise in infections like scrub typhus from ecotourism activities. Fuelled by the ease of air travel, novel zoonotic infections originating from the tropics have led to global respiratory pandemics. As such, clinicians worldwide should be aware of these new conditions as well as classical tropical bacterial pneumonias such as melioidosis. Rarer entities such as co-infections of leptospirosis and chikungunya or dengue will need careful consideration as well.

Treatment is mainly supportive. Aerosolized ribavirin can be used as a specific antiviral therapy for RSV, but this is less well studied in adults compared with infants. 22 Influenza A Influenza, which remains a global health burden, displays seasonality. A recent study of viral infectious patterns according to time of the year in a Singaporean medical intensive care unit by Siow et al. 16 showed peaking of influenza cases around the start and middle of the year. In this study, the most common viral isolate was the Influenza A H1N1/2009 virus, followed by human rhinovirus. The seasonal distribution of Influenza A in this study echoes the results of Tang et al. who found the incidence of Influenza A in Singapore to peak during January and June to July period, 23 as well as Chew et al. 24 who noted two peaks during the November to January and June to July period. In Singapore, months with heaviest rainfall are clustered around year-end (October to December), and drier months are clustered around mid-year, in June and July. Pharmacological treatments include antivirals such as oseltamivir and zanamivir to help shorten the duration of illness if administered within 48 h of onset of illness. 25 The seasonality of influenza therefore cannot be fully explained by rainfall alone.

Due to both environmental and socioeconomic factors, diseases such as melioidosis, leptospirosis and TB are more widespread in the tropics-these will be discussed later. Observation of the aetiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in an Asian outpatient setting showed that the most common isolates were Chlamydophila pneumoniae, followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. 35 That same systematic review by Peto et al. 35 identified S. pneumoniae as the most common pathogen in hospitalized patients with CAP. Although there was great variation in terms of proportion between countries in this study, frequency was similar to the trends observed in European studies quoted in the review and also comparable to findings by Siow et al. 16 Interestingly, the most common Gram-negative bacillus isolated in the studies was Klebsiella, with higher proportions being reported in India and Southeast Asia. The authors found that Asian patients with CAP requiring hospitalization yielded a larger proportion of Gramnegative bacilli (9.0% vs 2.7%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4.0% vs 1.4%) isolates compared with referenced European studies. 36 However, there was no comparison made between the Asian countries, as certain countries such as Korea and Japan experience a temperate climate compared with the tropical climates of Thailand and Malaysia. 35 Siow et al. found the top two causative pathogens to be S. pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a recent study looking at bacterial isolates from severe CAP patients in a Singaporean medical intensive care unit. 16 Streptococcus pneumoniae was the main Grampositive bacterium isolate, and S. aureus was the next common Gram-positive organism. Otherwise, Gramnegative organisms such as K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa represented the majority of cases detected. Similarly, Lin et al. 37 described K. pneumoniae not only as a prevailing cause of CAP with bacteraemia in a Taiwanese tertiary hospital, but also showed that it was associated with a more fulminant clinical course and worse prognosis when compared with patients with S. pneumoniae CAP with bacteraemia. In a series of severe CAP cases in Singapore, patients who had Gram-negative organisms isolated tended to have a worse outcome including a higher mortality, especially for patients with Pseudomonas and Burkholderia pseudomallei infections. 38 This has changed the way local clinicians initiate their empiric treatment for patients admitted for severe CAP, with antibiotics deliberately chosen to cover Gram-negative organisms, melioidosis as well as Gram-positive pathogens. A systematic review by Goyet et al. 39 looking at resistance patterns of CAP pathogens in Cambodia and neighbouring countries showed that up to 14% of S. pneumoniae and 26.5% of K. pneumoniae were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Streptococcus pneumoniae also displayed a high resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (average of 78.2%) and wide range of resistance patterns to cephalosporins: between 5.7% and 33.3% to ceftriaxone, and up to 47.4% to cefuroxime. There was also a mean high-level resistance rate to penicillin G of 25.2%. Burkholderia pseudomallei did not show resistance to first-line treatments ceftazidime, carbapenems and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. As a result of this study, the authors have advocated the preservation of fluoroquinolones as they are not warranted as first-line therapy, and they are also used to treat TB, which importantly is endemic in this region. 39 This highlights the importance of continued surveillance of regional resistance patterns and revision of therapeutic guidelines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 513, "end": 515, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 559, "end": 561, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 874, "end": 876, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1274, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1482, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1700, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1987, "end": 1989, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2509, "end": 2511, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2780, "end": 2782, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3651, "end": 3653, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA"}, {"text": "Melioidosis was first described by Krishnaswami and Whitmore in 1911, when they noticed a 'glanders-like' disease afflicting opiate addicts in Rangoon. 40 Today, melioidosis still poses a threat to public health due to mortality rates up to 40% 41 if early treatment is not instituted.

Acute illnesses usually present with pneumonia which can be associated with ARDS and shock. Subacute presentations may take a more insidious course, mimicking TB.

Anuradhapura is a region with abundant paddy fields for rice farming and was not previously known as an endemic area, so the diagnosis and outbreak of leptospirosis which followed flooding was initially challenged by local clinician. 47 Recreational events such as caving, canoeing and freshwater swimming could expose humans to contaminated sources. An example highlighting the impact of these activities would be the 1998 leptospirosis outbreak in Springfield, Illinois, involving triathletes who were exposed to lake water. 7 Clinical features are variable.
