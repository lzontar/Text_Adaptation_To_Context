The approach utilizes a map of social interactions characterizing the population and its activities and, unifying the compartmental and the stochastic viewpoints, offers a framework for incorporating both the patterns of behaviour studied by sociological surveys and the clinical picture of a particular infection, both for the virus itself and the complications it causes. The approach is illustrated by taking a simple mathematical model developed in its framework and applying it to the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), with the UK as a representative country, to assess the impact of the measures of social distancing imposed to control its course.",

Thus, for a mathematical model of the epidemic dynamics to be useable in practice, it should differentiate individuals first of all with regard to their socioeconomic roles and account for the interpersonal contacts associated with them.",

The latter somewhat abstract approach is an extension on earlier works in this direction [20] [21] [22] [23] where particular, more disease-specific, situation were considered. A shortcoming of the developed approach, apparent once it is reduced to its simplest variant, is that, according to it, a representative susceptible comes in contact only with one person in a given 'patch', so that the probability of coming across an infective is the ratio of the number of infectives to the total population in this patch. Neither the groups nor the patches are linked with social activities and this makes it difficult to specify the matrices involved for a practical application of the model, and the basic SEIR scheme makes it problematic to account for the infectiveness 'profile' of a disease in question. The latter aspect is of particular importance in the situations where many cases go asymptomatically with varying infectivity and/or if the infection has a long latent period.",

In its turn, the recovery process is inseparable from the functioning of the healthcare system so that the epidemics-related role of the healthcare system also has to be modelled mathematically, at least on a basic level. In short, a realistic mathematical model intended to describe epidemics of communicable diseases requires a systematic approach able to incorporate (i) the specifically human form of organization of society and the social groups determined by it, (ii) the 'epidemiological profile' of the disease accounting for both the time scales characterizing its stages and the associated variations in the probabilities involved in the spreading and recovery process, and (iii) the functioning of the health care system in terms of effectiveness and availability of medical help.",

The model is described in the form of an algorithm which provides a practical user-friendly instrument for the description of the course of epidemics and, in particular, allows one to model the impact of restrictions and social distancing measures that could be imposed to curb an outbreak.

This expectation involves an implicit assumption that the time is a continuous independent variable and the dependent variables are differentiable functions of it. What this assumption means is that the time scale of 'elementary processes' and the time scale on which the system as a whole evolves are well separated so that one can introduce an intermediate time scale of averaging, large compared with the former and small compared with the latter, for the correspondingly averaged quantities to make sense. A well known example of this type of modelling can be found in continuum mechanics [24] where one deals with differential equations, both in the spatial variables and time, as the length and time scales associated with molecular interactions ('elementary processes') are negligible compared with the length and time scales on which averaged quantities characterizing the medium evolve. This is manifestly not the case with the dynamics of epidemics where the 'elementary processes' of susceptibles turning into infectives occur on the same time scale as the time scale on which the numbers characterizing the epidemic macroscopically evolve: these numbers simply accumulate individual acts of contracting the disease. To put it simply, the epidemiological status of an individual, if changes, does so on a daily basis as well, and this is also the time scale on which the variables characterizing the epidemic as a whole evolve. This means that for the epidemic the time should not be treated as a continuous variable; it is discrete, measured in days and should be treated as such in the model. Hence, for the epidemic dynamics one should choose the mathematics of the difference, not differential, equations, with the time step of 1 (day). Importantly, the epidemic's dynamics is monitored on a daily basis and the clinical status of those affected is also reported daily in the epidemics statistics so that the mathematics of the difference equations provides a natu-.

For the model to be verified by comparing the results it predicts with observational data, ideally, (a) the whole population should be tested on a daily basis, (b) those tested positive but showing no symptoms should not be informed for them not to change their social behaviour and continuing to spread the disease as if not tested, and (c) the social behaviour of the population should not be influenced by the information campaign about the ongoing epidemic broadcast by the media. Obviously, for a serious epidemic, like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, none of these conditions, ideal for the epidemics modeller, can be satisfied. The cases reported in the epidemics statistics refer not to those infected; the data refer to those diagnosed. The number of diagnosed is a mix of those tested positive who showed clinical symptoms and sought medical help and those of the asymptomatic infectives who happened to be covered by the testing programme and tested positive. The former had already withdrawn from daily activities because of being ill and hence no longer spread the disease whilst the latter have to withdraw from the daily routine and self-isolate because of the result of testing. In other words, the reported epidemiological data are, like in quantum mechanics, affected by the way they are collected. The wider the testing programme, the more asymptomatic infectives it turns into those with a diagnosis and hence the more it makes the collected data a mix and the subsequent course of the epidemic influenced by it as a factor external to the epidemic as such. A related issue is reliability of the tests themselves. In the case of a new virus, the testing methods evolve as the epidemic unfolds which often makes earlier data underpredictive. In short, from the modelling viewpoint, the reported epidemiological data should be taken with caution, and one should begin with clarifying what the reported cases actually represent.",

Thus, the UK data gives a relatively clean sample, with the reported cases representing essentially those with complications of the infection, whilst the set of those with no or mild to moderate symptoms can be much wider. By contrast, in Russia the guidance is to call the ambulance at the first symptoms or even suspicion and, in addition, a very wide testing programme, with blanket coverage of large segments of the population, is in place, with hospitals financially incentivized to bring asymptomatic infectives into the fold. As a result, the Russian data is of much less value for the modeller as it strongly depends on the testing programme as an external factor, with the number of cases increasing as the testing programme widens.",

In dealing with the relevant functional dependencies, we will represent them in a simple functional form intended to capture the trends and elucidate the influence of parameters; where the relevant data become available with higher accuracy than the overall accuracy of the model, these dependencies can be replaced with the empirical data without any changes to the approach itself.

Traditionally, 'service industries' include the retail sector, financial sector, public sector business administration, leisure and cultural activities. However, viewed through the prism of epidemiology and the above categories, a substantial part of people involved in traditional 'service industries' belong to our category W , not S. For example, the education sector comprises not only those who provide education but also those receiving it and therefore should be attributed to W as interacting within their own professional community. Furthermore, in the service sector as such a substantial part of jobs are back office jobs not dealing with customers and hence again belonging to W .

The basis of the approach is that it essentially follows one's daily routine (averaged over a suitable short period, say, a week), looking at it through the prism of one's communications with different groups of people that might result in contraction of a communicable infection. The broad categories used in the simplest model we introduced here to illustrate the approach can be split into subcategories, if the available information allows, down to particular businesses, and account for the gender, age group, etc. Similarly, the set of activities can be made more detailed, most importantly regarding the socializing element where social contacts enable the disease to cross boundaries between categories. Basically, our approach follows the tracking method used to trace the interaction path of an individual infection carrier at an early stage of an epidemic. This tracking is the key idea of the stochastic approach, and here we applied it to larger cohorts of people, thus utilizing the compartmental framework. In this sense, the new approach unifies the two main approaches that so far have been developing separately.",

This feature is the key difference between the new approach and the models treating the population as structureless, essentially animal-like, solely in terms of compartments related to the disease (SIR, SEIR, etc). An immediate consequence of the difference is that the recommendations following from the latter apply indiscriminately to the whole population irrespective of what their economic implications may be thus essentially making them unworkable. By contrast, the present framework makes it possible to rank the categories it uses with regard to their importance for the short-and medium-term functioning of the economy and thus allows one to produce a 'map' of an epidemic with the two axes being the cost to society due to the disease and the cost due to shutting down the economy. This map, broadly similar for different communicable diseases, would help to strike the socially acceptable balance between these two costs.",

In other words, this notion can be incorporated without any ad hoc constructions. However, for the resulting model to be specific and hence useable, one needs sociological information about the 'profile' of households for a given population in terms of representatives of what categories and in what proportion households bring together, as it is this information that largely determines the probabilities of transmission of the disease between different categories.",

Such flows can be introduced in an obvious way but, for the embracing model to be specific, one will need information regarding how travelling between different locations is inscribed in the daily/weekly routines of the people belonging to different categories.",
