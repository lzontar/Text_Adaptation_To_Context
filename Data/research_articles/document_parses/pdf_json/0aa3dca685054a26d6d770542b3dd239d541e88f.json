Moreover, retailers are faced to manage high stores' networks. This way, they use a common assortment shared in the stores' network to allow an easier management [14] . Therefore, stores share a common and centralised assortment [18] with some tolerated exceptions to take into account specific characteristics of stores in the network [16] . To improve their global performance, retailers aim to increase their knowledge on stores' specific characteristics in the network to suggest the optimal assortment for each store, e.g., they try to identify the products that perform remarkably in some stores of the network to recommend them to other similar stores.

To better understand the complexity of the task, it must be remembered that some hypermarkets offer up to 100,000 products [16] . Defining the ideal assortment in a department store consists in selecting this set of products. More formally, this thorny problem corresponds to an insoluble combinatorial optimization problem. In practice, decisions are made locally by a category manager, while the problem of the ideal assortment should correspond to a global decision at the store level. To tackle this question, retailers have prior knowledge available [17] . Indeed, department store are organized into categories, e.g., food, household products, textiles, etc. These categories are themselves divided into families or units of need (e.g. textiles category is derived into woman, man and child sections and so on). This hierarchical organization of products makes it possible to reason about families of products, structure the decision and thus avoid combinatorial explosion. Most of the time, a hypermarket cannot choose a single product to increase its offer. Indeed, this additional item necessarily belongs to a level of assortment or product line, generally in adequacy with the size or the location of the store: choosing a product requires to take all products associated to the same level of assortment [16, 18] . For example, if a store offers a soda section, it can be satisfied with a minimum offer, e.g., Coca-Cola 1.5L; but it can also claim a product range more consistent: for example, it would like to offer Lipton 2L, nevertheless, increase cannot be realized product by product, but by subset of products and the final offer should be Coca-Cola 1.5L + Lipton 2L + Orangina 1.5L + Schweppes 1.5L.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 204, "end": 208, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 636, "end": 640, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1396, "end": 1400, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1404, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The proposed approach includes prior knowledge on the hierarchical organization of products by family and constraints on levels of assortment for each family.

For each of these families of products F i , a product range or level of assortment s(F i ) is defined: for each family of products, the department store may choose the wideness of s(F i ) in a finite set of opportunities imposed by the direction of the stores' network. Formally, for each family, a hierarchy of subsets of products s ki (F i ) = 1..n in the sense of the inclusion relationship (i.e. s ki (F i ) \u2282 s ki+1 (F i )) is defined and the department store can only choose among the subsets s ki (F i ) as product range for F i (e.g. imagine the minimal product range of the Soda family would be Coca-Cola 1.5L, the second one Coca-Cola 1.5L + Lipton 2L + Orangina 1.5L + Schweppes 1.5L, and so on). Thus, s(F i ) can only be a subset of products that belongs to this finite set of product ranges s ki (F i ) = 1..n defined a priori by retailer.

It is thus easy to inform this point in the optimization problem. On the other hand, it is thornier to estimate p(s ki+1 (F i )) that is however essential to assess the expected performance of the new product range. When the level of assortment of the store is k i , it is easy to fill in its turnover p(s ki (F i )) in the knapsack problem but p(s ki+1 (F i )) cannot directly assessed. We have to design an estimator of p(s ki+1 (F i )). It can only be estimated from other reference measurements encountered in other similar stores. The basic idea is that the more similar these \"reference\" stores are to the store of concern, the more reliable the estimation. The most difficult problem is to define what \"reference\" means.

Because some hypermarkets offer up to 100,000 products, the clustering process on such a metrics space would be based on a sparse matrix and then suffer from the space dimension. Furthermore, such a distance would not capture the hierarchical organization of products in the concept of similarity. Indeed, let's go back to the hierarchical organization of products in families. We can note that a fruits and vegetables specialist department store is obviously closer to a large grocery store than to a hardware store because the first two are food superstores whereas the last one is a speciality store: the first two propose the same super family F F ood . This intuitive similarity cannot be assessed with classical distances. The hierarchical products organization in families of products and super families is prior knowledge to be considered when assessing how similar two departments stores are.

By contrast, it requires a higher storage cost c(s ki+1 (F i )) than c(s ki (F i )). Therefore, the storage cost of at least one product family F j,j =i must be reduced to keep the overall storage cost of the department store constant. Then, the reduced turnover p(s kj\u22121 (F j )) of the family F j has yet to be estimated to complete the optimization problem. However, this estimation can easily be processed. Indeed, because s kj\u22121 (F j ) \u2282 s kj (F j ), p(s kj\u22121 (F j )) can simply be deduced from p(s kj (F j )): it is the sum of the turnovers of all products that belong to s kj (F j ) \u2229 s kj\u22121 (F j ).

The main difficulty is the assessment of the turnovers when k F and k V are changed into k F + j and k V + j'. An estimation of these turnovers has to be computed in order to evaluate the performance of the candidate values k F + j and k V +j' in the knapsack problem. As explained above this estimation is based on the turnovers of similar stores that propose k F + j and k V + j' for families Fruits and Vegetables. To this end, we apply semantic similarity measures on the product taxonomy to compute a similarity matrix between stores (cf. Sect. 4). The unknown turnovers are then assessed from those of the most similar stores. The stores' similarity matrix is based on semantic similarity measures (in this experiment, the Resnik's measure for the semantic similarity measure and the BMA for the groupwise measure using the semantic library tools 1 ). Note that, this step allows defining similarities between stores and can be used to define semantic clusters of stores [19] . Once the matrix is defined, it is used to estimate the turnovers of increased candidate product ranges (k F + j and k V + j') estimated as the corresponding turnovers of the nearest stores that propose k F + j and k V + j' for F and V .

To achieve this goal semantic approaches are used not only to improve knowledge on stores but also to make the estimations of the consequences of assortment changes more reliable. As a matter of fact, the proposed approach includes prior knowledge from the taxonomy of products used to formalize the ideal assortment problem into a knapsack problem. The estimation of the expected benefits associated to changes in the product range of products' families is based on results of similar stores. Those similarities are identified by means of semantic similarity measures we previously studied in the field of biomedical information retrieval. The use of semantic approaches brings more appropriate results to retailers because it includes part of their knowledge on the organization of products sold. The management of the products' taxonomy notably reduces the search space for the knapsack problem. It also allows defining an appropriate similarity matrix between the stores of a network that takes into account the way the turnovers of the stores are distributed. It implies they have approximately the same types of customers. The definition of this similarity is crucial for the estimation of turnovers required in the knapsack problem.
