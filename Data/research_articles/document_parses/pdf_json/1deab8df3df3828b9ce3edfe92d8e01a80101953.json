This virus was first identified around December 2019, from central China, but later spread in the rest of the world. To ensure better healthcare service management, an accurate prediction of the uncertain gruesomeness is situational demand. In orders with limited information frameworks, demonstrating and predicting COVID-19 turns into a challenging endeavor. The primary objective of this study is to propose a hybrid model that incorporates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the COVID-19 epidemic. A real-time COVID-19 time series data has been used on the window periods January 22, 2020, to May 18, 2020. The time-series data first decomposed using EEMD to produce sub-signals and make original data denoised, and ANN architecture has built to train the denoised data. Finally, the result of the proposed model has compared with some traditional statistical analysis. The result of this investigation shows our proposed model outperforms compared with traditional statistical analysis. Thus the model might be promising for COVID-19 epidemic prediction. The government and healthcare provider can take preventive action by understanding the upcoming COVID-19 situation for better healthcare management.",

Fanelli and Piazza (2020) offer in their forecasting research employing the simple susceptible-infected-recovered-deaths model for specific countries. Findings reveal that there is particular universality within the time evaluation of the COVID-19 epidemic spreading. Petropoulos and Makridakis (2020) found past data of COVID-19 will not change the role of \"business-as-usual\" (nothing change) employing a simple time series forecasting analysis. Though predicting the future of the epidemic is much more difficult as the cases are exponentially growing and data is non-linear and non-stationary. Still predicting COVID-19 is invaluable for a better understanding of the current situation and for making a short-term plan by the policymakers. Both of the previous studies have been used in the traditional forecasting method with statistical modeling-however, rear literature deals with the machine learning approach for COVID-19 epidemic prediction. Tuli, Tuli, Tuli, and Gill (2020) proposed a cloud-based machine learning model for COVID-19 prediction and offers research opportunities for integrating the time-series model such as ARIMA with their proposed mathematical model. Thus, introducing an efficient model with the best accuracy is the situational demand. As discussed earlier, COVID-19 data is non-linear and non-stationary, it's more effective to apply decomposition methods rather than directly implement the ARIMA model (Du et al., 2014) . Bridging the emerging literacy gap, this study proposes a hybrid EEMD-ANN hybrid model for the prediction of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

Early and accurate prediction of COVID-19 growth could be helpful to healthcare providers for cost-effective healthcare management and might reduce gruesomeness of the pandemic. In general, predicting non-linear and non-stationary time series data is a crucial task in the health analytics domain. Managing operational excellence in healthcare, accurate prediction of COVID-19 plays a vital role. It is a challenging task to predict the growth rate of COVID-19 patients due to inconsistent, non-linear, and non-stationary data. In the recent past, various non-linear data-driven models such as ANN, Support vector machine (SVM) (Meng et al., 2019) have been proposed for multiple research domains. Despite an enormous literature, these models have no complete execution that has been made significance in healthcare informatics. However, ANN is most widely used in the time series prediction due to its powerful parallel processing and capacity to estimate for virtually any function up to a self-assertive level of precision. But regardless of the excellent execution of ANN, there is still space to improve its estimate accuracy (Tan et al., 2018) .",

For example, El-Hendawi and Wang (2020) developed wavelet packet transform with ANN for short term electricity load forecasting, Olanrewaju, Jimoh, and Kholopane (2013) investigated energy potentiality using index decomposition analysis with ANN. However, EEMD-ANN based prediction is somehow not a new approach in other research domains (Tan et al., 2018) rather than health analytics. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a recently adapted method to decompose noise assisted data, which is extensively used in time series data analytics. EMD disintegrated the original data into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Due to some drawbacks of EMD, i.e., stopping criteria of shifting process, mode mixing, and border effect problem, EEMD (Wu & Huang, 2009 ) is a white noise assisted decomposition process widely used recently. EEMD repeatedly decomposes the original signal by adding white noise into a series of IMFs by applying the original EMD process.",

Thus it is worth improving the prediction of the COVID-19 epidemic.This study proposed and investigated a hybrid model EEMD-ANN technique to predict the daily trend of the COVID-19 epidemic based on the real-time global COVID-19 time series dataset. First, we employed the EEMD decomposition technique to denoise the time series and then build an ANN model to train and predict the data. Finally, we compare the proposed EEMD-ANN model with some traditional statistical techniques. Following the output, EEMD-ANN provides a promising indicator to predict the COVID-19 epidemic.",
