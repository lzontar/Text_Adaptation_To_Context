Technology can be used to best mobilize resources such as food and water in the event of a natural disaster, by semi-automatically flagging tweets and short messages as indicating an urgent need. The problem is challenging not just because of the sparseness of data in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, but because of the varying characteristics of disasters in developing countries (making it difficult to train just one system) and the noise and quirks in social media. In this paper, we present a robust, low-supervision social media urgency system that adapts to arbitrary crises by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data in an ensemble setting. The system is also able to adapt to new crises where an unlabeled background corpus may not be available yet by utilizing a simple and effective transfer learning methodology. Experimentally, our transfer learning and low-supervision approaches are found to outperform viable baselines with high significance on myriad disaster datasets.",

Urgency detection may be understood to be a very specific version of the relevance detection problem. Similar to the latter, urgency detection also falls in a class of information retrieval (IR) problems, which attempt to detect and rank relevant messages and documents. However, there is an added dimension to urgency detection, since (as defined above) an actionable need, possibly implied, must be expressed in the tweet that could potentially be resolved if dealt with in a time-sensitive manner. For example, a message such as 'Roof collapse in building on Main Street; multiple people trapped inside' may be deemed to be urgent; however, messages such as 'Roof collapse due to storm at midnight; all people successfully evacuated' and 'Avalanche in Nepal caused four deaths' are relevant and may assist in studying the disaster further (or even mobilizing long-term response) but are not particularly urgent, either because it does not require immediate action or because the damage has already occurred. Informativeness as a broad problem has undergone some study (Olteanu et al. 2014 ) (see also Sect. 2), but to our knowledge, urgency as a specific IR area has not received the same kind of special attention despite its utility to first responders in times of crisis.",

            "text": "In this paper, we present practical approaches for crisisspecific minimally supervised urgency detection on short message streams such as Twitter. The presented approaches cover two scenarios that often emerge in the real world. In the first scenario, a small amount (a few hundred messages) of training data labeled as urgent or non-urgent is available, along with a copious 'unlabeled' background corpus. In the second scenario, similar data are available for a 'source' domain but not for the target domain (expressing a 'new crisis') for which the urgency detection needs to be deployed. In other words, as messages are streaming in for this new domain, investigators label a few samples, but cannot rely on the availability of a background corpus since urgency needs to be tagged in real time before the crisis has fully subsided. To accomplish this challenging goal, our approach relies on a simple and robust transfer learning methodology (Pan and Yang 2010) . Experimental results on three real-world datasets and several performance metrics validate our methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such paper investigating the problem of urgency detection in social media, both algorithmically and empirically, for arbitrary disasters in low-supervision and transfer learning settings.",

A good introduction to the field was provided in a recent Science policy forum article (Palen and Anderson 2016) . The field draws on interdisciplinary strands of research, especially with respect to collecting, processing and analyzing real-world data. Particularly, social media platforms like Twitter have emerged as important channels ('social sensors ' Sakaki et al. 2010) for situational awareness in support of crisis informatics. Although situational awareness is a broad notion extending beyond crisis informatics (e.g., military situational awareness), urgency detection is a special kind of situational awareness that tends to arise mainly in the crisis domain. A direct application is to help first responders and aid agencies assess needs in crisis-stricken areas and mobilize resources effectively (i.e., where needs are most urgent). While the initial primary focus of situational awareness and sensing systems was on earthquakes (Avvenuti et al. 2014; Crooks et al. 2013) , the focus has diversified in recent years to disasters as diverse as floods, fire, and hurricanes (Arthur et al. 2017; Vieweg et al. 2010) . We note that Twitter is by far the most monitored social media platform during crises (Simon et al. 2015) due to the availability of the published data and its real-time nature. Increasingly sophisticated approaches have been presented for data collection, including dynamic lexicons (Olteanu et al. 2014) and analysis tools like TweetTracker (Kumar et al. 2011) .",

We only cite a few recent papers by way of reference. Recently, (Purohit et al. 2020) have described a method to rank and group social media requests for emergency services, a work that is particularly relevant since the outbreak of COVID-19. Recent work in opinion mining (e.g., see Keyvanpour et al. 2020) , especially using lexicons and machine learning in social media, is also relevant to our work. Another extremely relevant work is a recent article that described a lightweight and multilingual framework for crisis information extraction from Twitter data (Interdonato et al. 2019 ). The research presented in that paper, though not resolving the problem of detecting urgent tweets, is compatible with our own work since it presents a relatively unsupervised and lightweight paradigm, and uses similar metrics. Other papers have tried to look at specific crises, e.g., the work by (Ladner et al. 2019) in analyzing tweets to determine the activeness of the Syrian refugee crisis. Another article has tried to do disaster damage assessment from Twitter data using statistical features and 'informative words,' not dissimilar to our own lexicon-based approach (Madichetty and Sridevi 2019) . A last example is the work in (Klein et al. 2012) , which describes a project called SABESS that uses social network analysis for identifying reliable tweets and apply content analysis in order to summarize important 'emergency facts.' These six examples are among a sample of several pieces of work that have tried to use social media productively in helping to analyze or provide actionable intelligence during a crisis situation attesting to the ongoing importance of the problem.",

Another important line of work is in analyzing events other than natural disasters (such as mass convergence and disruption events), but still relevant to crisis informatics. For example, Stabird et al. presented a collaborative filtering system for identifying on-the-ground 'Twitterers' during mass disruptions (Starbird et al. 2012) . Similar techniques could be employed to supplement the work in this paper. In a similar vein, the CrisisTracker system (Rogstadius et al. 2013) is another example of a system that uses crowdsourced social media curation for disaster awareness. The system does not specifically address the urgency detection problem, however. AIDR is a system that is more closely aligned with the goal of using AI for better disaster response (Imran et al. 2014) , but its goal is to classify messages into a set of user-defined categories of information such as 'needs' and 'damages.' In contrast, we consider needs at a higher-level of classification; namely, is it urgent or nonurgent? The outputs of AIDR are compatible with our own since both systems provide actionable information to first responders.",

It also includes tools to help users create their own collections and lexicons. In contrast, Project EPIC, launched in 2009 and supported by a US National Science Foundation grant, is a multi-disciplinary effort involving several universities and languages with the goal of utilizing behavioral and technical knowledge of computer-mediated communication for better crisis study and emergency response. Since its founding, Project EPIC has led to several advances in the crisis informatics space; see, for example, Palen et al. 2015; Kogan et al. 2015; Anderson et al. 2013; Soden et al. 2014) .",

We have released our model openly, and potentially, this released model could be integrated into some of the platforms described above. Crowdsourcing could be used in lieu of (or even in addition to) the active learning framework presented as one of the solutions to the low supervision challenge described later in this article. It could also be used to provide more confidence in the annotations, since there is an inherent element of subjectivity when one is labeling a tweet as 'urgent.' Note that most labeling problems in machine learning involve some subjectivity, and inter-annotation agreement has been found to be a concern in some cases. Whether such concerns arise in the case of urgency detection is an unknown issue that does not fall within the scope of the presented work, but could be a valuable issue to address in future research.",

            "text": "Other lines of work relevant to this paper involve minimally supervised machine learning, representation learning and transfer learning. Concerning minimally supervised machine learning (ML), in general, ML techniques where there are few, and in the case of zero-shot learning (Palatucci et al. 2009; Romera-Paredes and Torr 2015) , no observed instances for a label has been a popular research agenda for many years (Uszkoreit et al. 2009; Aggarwal and Zhai 2012) . In addition to weak supervision approaches Aggarwal and Zhai (2012) , both semi-supervised and active learning have also been studied in great depth, with surveys provided by (Zhu 2005; Settles 2010 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, a successful systems-level conjunction of various minimally supervised ML techniques has not been achieved for the task of short-text urgency detection. Such as empirical assessment is an important goal of this paper. Due to the current renaissance of neural networks (Sahlgren 2005), embedding and representation learning methods have become more popular due to the advent of fast and effective models like skip-gram. Recent work has used such embeddings in numerous NLP and graph-theoretic applications (Collobert et al. 2011) , including information extraction (Kejriwal and Szekely 2017) , named entity recognition (Nadeau and Sekine 2007) and entity linking (Moro et al. 2014 ). The most well-known example is word2vec (for words) (Mikolov et al. 2013) , followed by similar models like paragraph2vec (for multi-word text) and fasttext (Dai et al. 2015; Joulin et al. 2016) , the last two being most relevant for the work in this paper. For a recent evaluation study on representation learning for text, including potential problems, we refer the reader to (Faruqui et al. 2016) .",

More recent work on domain adaptation may be found in , with the work in (Pedrood and Purohit 2018 ) applied specifically to the disaster response problem. Pedrood and Purohit (2018) also applied transfer learning to the problem of mining help intent on Twitter. Other relevant work in crisis informatics, both in terms of defining 'actionable information' problems like urgency and need mining, and providing multimodal Twitter datasets from natural disasters, may be found in (He et al. 2017; Purohit et al. 2018) and . Caragea et al., for example, present an approach to identifying informative messages in crises by using CNNs (Caragea et al. 2016) . Other similar works include Burel et al. (2017) Burel and Alani (2018), Nguyen et al. (2016) , (2017) and ). An important difference between the class of papers cited and our own work is that we are not seeking to detect events in crisis situations, but are instead trying to assign urgency scores to sub-events that are happening in the aftermath of a disaster. The two problems are related in that better accuracy on event detection (for which these deep learning systems could be used to great effect) would lead to better identification of urgent events. However, urgency detection is a difficult problem in and of itself, beyond the broader problem of isolating informative events related to the disaster from an incoming stream of messages. Some of the work above is multimodal (e.g., the paper by Nguyen et al. (2017) ), which would be an interesting direction for future research for urgency detection (from images and videos, rather than just text).",

(2019) considers the earlier problem of detecting tweets that are relevant to the crisis itself, rather than the problem of assigning an urgency score to events that are detected. In general, we are not aware of a few-shot or minimally supervised technique that tackles urgency detection for the purposes of triage.",

First, we apply a tokenizer to split the sentences into lists of words and delete words with special prefixes (including @ and RT, which are particularly prevalent in Twitter) and special suffixes. We also remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert the entire sentence to lowercase. Next, similar to traditional machine learning pipelines, we extract a set of manual features for expressing prior human knowledge about urgency detection. Our manual features are thus called because they are primarily keyword-based and binary, with keywords selected based on data exploration and domain knowledge. We consider ten such keywords, namely hit, help, kill, injure, strand, miss, urgent, die, need, food. If any of these keywords are present 5 , the corresponding feature is set to 1. Note that these keywords are associated with situations that are generally urgent, like people who have been attacked or affected by a crisis and need urgent help, but some are noisier than others 6 . Additionally, we also utilize an eleventh feature that checks to see if any numeric digits are present in the dataset. The rationale behind this feature is that, in more urgent tweets, numbers are often present, e.g., '15 climbers are currently trapped on Everest due to the avalanche.'",

Besides, it is prudent to utilize the large number of unlabeled tweets (background corpus) if it serves a useful purpose in improving performance. To that end, we train a skip-gram based word embedding model based on the 'bag of tricks' model released by researchers from Facebook in a package called fastTextJoulin et al. (2016) . The reason behind using fastText, as opposed to alternate word embedding models like GloVe and word2vec Mikolov et al. (2013) , is several-fold. First, fastText is very fast and easy to execute and is well maintained. Second, preliminary analyses showed that it does quite well on social media tasks and because of the bag of tricks methodology (that uses character and sub-word embeddings to gracefully deal with OOVs 7 and misspellings), it is able to generalize much better. Finally, fastText's APIs include a way to get sentence embeddings directly after training the word embedding model. By training fastText on the background corpus, we are able to train a robust embedding model. In both the training and test phases, we use this model to get feature vectors for our messages besides the 11-dimensional manual feature vector described earlier.",

Our approach for urgency transfer is captured in Algorithm 1. Many of the steps are similar to those for RQ1, including preprocessing, but there are some important differences; hence, we use pseudocode to express the workflow more precisely. For example, while the Wiki embedding model remains the same as earlier, the manual features are obviously extracted over the target domain (since they do not require a background corpus) and importantly, the 'local' embedding model is now trained over the source domain corpus, since there is no target domain unlabeled background corpus available.",

For the two other Twitter-based datasets, we used active learning to compose a labeled set that would contain challenging examples. The basic process was to do data preprocessing as described in Sect. 4, followed by training the local fastText-based word embedding model on all messages in the corpus. Next, we randomly labeled 50 urgent and non-urgent tweets and fed them into a classifier. The classifier was applied on the rest of the unlabeled data to obtain 'ambiguous' examples (where the classifier's probability of the positive label was closest to 50%). We labeled another 100 samples this way and continued to re-train and apply the classifier for two more iterations till we obtained a total of 400 labeled points 11 . Note that the final labeled dataset may not be balanced in terms of urgent and non-urgent messages. Table 2 shows that Nepal is roughly balanced, while Kerala is imbalanced. We used stratified sampling therefore to split the labeled pool into training and testing datasets for evaluating the two research questions. We used 90% for training and 10% for testing.

While the local embeddings are trained on the source domain (since unlabeled data are not available for the target domain), all classifier training is always done on the target. Locally Supervised with Up-sampling and Source Embedding (Upsample): This baseline is the same as Embedding Transform, except to boost the power of the baseline, we upsample the labeled data (in the target dataset) by 6x. Thus, this baseline tries to mitigate source bias and concept drift by giving more importance to the transfer domain. This baseline is also more appropriate for the case where the target training data are extremely limited. Table 4 illustrates the result for RQ1 on the Nepal and Kerala datasets. The results illustrate the viability of urgency detection in low-supervision settings (with our approach yielding 69.44% F-measure on Nepal, at 99% significance compared to the local baseline), with different feature sets contributing differently to the four metrics. While the local embedding model can reduce precision, for example, it can help the system to improve and accuracy and recall. Similarly, manual features reduce recall, but help the system to improve accuracy and precision (sometimes considerably). To truly address the urgency problem, therefore, a multipronged ensemble approach is justified, as also argued intuitively in Section IV. We also note that the pre-trained Wikipedia embedding model proved to be an important tool in improving the generalization ability of the model and not requiring any labeled or unlabeled data; in essence, serving as a free resource that could be helped to regularize and stabilize models that would otherwise be uncertain in lowsupervision settings.",

Note that at least one of the transfer learning methods always bests the Local baseline on all metrics (except precision in Table 7 , a result not found to be significant even at the 90% level). Our approach shows a slight improvement over the upsampling baseline on two of the four scenarios (Tables 5, 7) by 2-2.7% on the F-measure metric, which shows the diminishing returns from mixing source and target labeled training data.

In the second scenario, similar data are available for a 'source' domain but not for the target domain (expressing a 'new crisis') for which the urgency detection needs to be deployed. As messages are streaming in for this new domain, investigators label a few samples, but cannot rely on the availability of a background corpus since urgency needs to be tagged in real time before the crisis has fully subsided.

In looking at the references they cite, the effectiveness of deep transfer learning does not seem to have been demonstrated thus far for difficult and irregular social media datasets However, we believe that this presents an opportunity for further study, especially as new and different crises like COVID-19 continue to threaten our way of life at a global scale.",
