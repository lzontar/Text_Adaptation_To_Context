The development of increasingly efficient hydrological models is an essential element in the study of the water cycle dynamics. Many models have been proposed to predict these phenomena (cfr. [27] ). Most of them use a physical approach based on partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the real phenomenon. Nevertheless, since their analytical solution is often unknown, an approximate solution is obtained by applying a numerical method such as Finite Differences, Finite Elements, or Finite Volumes (cf. [6, 14] ). In most cases, a time-explicit recurrence relation is obtained, which expresses the next state of the generic (discrete) element of the system as a function of the current states of a limited number of neighboring elements. For this reason, the most explicit schemes can be formalized in terms of Cellular Automata (CA) [25] , which is one of the best-known and most widely used decentralized discrete parallel calculation models (cf. [4, 5, 8, 9, 16, 20, 22, 26, 29] ). Nevertheless, a kind of global control over the simulation is often useful to make the modeling of certain processes more straightforward.

It concerned a heterogeneous terrain with very dry initial conditions, having three main horizontal soil layers and a fourth soil type inserted in the deepest of them (Fig. 1) . The main hydraulic properties of the four soil types are reported in Table 1 . The original two-dimensional test case domain was 8.00 m long and 6.50 m deep, with a uniform rain rate r ir of 0.02 m d \u22121 for a length of 2.25 m along the left side of the upper boundary layer (Fig. 1) . Along the other boundaries, Neumann's conditions (no flow) were imposed.

Accordingly, a grid of n r = 160 rows, n c = 30 columns, and n s = 130 slices was obtained. The input rain was accordingly extended to the third dimension (Fig. 1) .
