Subgroup discovery aims at discovering subsets of objects -known as subgroups -described by interesting descriptions according to a quality measure calculated on the target label. A quality measure has to capture discrepancies in the target label distribution between the selected subset of objects and the overall dataset. A large panel of exhaustive [1, 10] and heuristic [5, 16] subgroup discovery algorithms have been proposed so far. Most of these approaches consider a set of nominal attributes with a binary label. Regarding numerical attributes, a few approaches [11, 19] that avoid the use of basic discretization techniques have been introduced. However, to the best of our knowledge, we lack a method that would support an exhaustive search and thus the possibility to guarantee the computation of a global optimum for the quality measure without the use of discretization in some form or other.

Traditionally, subgroup mining has been mainly concerned with nominal attributes and binary target labels. To deal with numerical data, prior discretization of the attributes [6, 8] is then required. Numerical target labels can also be discretized [18] . However, discretization generally involves a loss of information such that we cannot guarantee the optimality of the returned subgroups. [2] introduced the concept of Quantitative Association Rules where a rule consequent is the mean or the variance of a numerical attribute. A rule is then defined as interesting if its mean or variance significantly deviates from that of the overall dataset. Later on, [21] proposed an extension of such rules called Impact Rules. These methods, however, cannot perform an exhaustive enumeration of subgroups and therefore provide no guarantee for an optimal subgroup discovery. A recurring issue with exhaustive pattern enumeration algorithms is the size of the search space which is exponential as a function of the number of attributes. Fortunately, the search space can be pruned thanks to optimistic estimates [12, 22] . [15] introduces a large panel of quality measures and optimistic estimates for an exhaustive mining with numerical target labels. A few approaches have been proposed to tackle numerical attributes [11, 16, 19] . However, these methods always involve the use of discretization techniques. When dealing with exhaustive search in numerical data, we find the MinIntChange algorithm [13] based on constructs from Formal Concept Analysis [7] . It enables an exhaustive mining of frequent patterns -not subgroups -in numerical data without prior discretization. The use of closure operators and equivalence classes [4, 9, 10, 20] is a popular solution to reduce the size of the subgroup search space. [3] introduced an anytime subgroup discovery algorithm in numerical data for binary target labels by revisiting the principles of MinIntChange.

We leverage the concept of closure on the positives adapted to numerical labels to significantly reduce the number of candidate interval patterns. After each minimal change (Line 4), instead of evaluating the resulting interval pattern, we compute and evaluate the corresponding closed on the positives interval pattern (Line 5). When carrying out an exhaustive search of all closed on the positives interval patterns, a given interval pattern can be generated multiple times. To avoid this redundancy and to ensure the unicity of the pattern generation, a popular solution is the use of a canonicity test. In the case of interval patterns, the canonicity test verifies that the closure operation did not lead to a change on an interval preceding the interval on which the minimal change has been applied (Line 6). However, the successive application of left or right minimal changes on an interval can also lead to multiple generations of the same interval pattern. A solution is to use a constraint on the minimal changes. After a right minimal change, a right or left minimal change can be applied. However, a left minimal change must always be followed by a left minimal change. We also exploit advanced pruning techniques to reduce the size of the search space. This can be done through the use of a tight optimistic estimate of the quality of a closed on the positives interval pattern specializations. For each subgroup, an optimistic estimate is derived (Line 7) , and, if it is lower than the best subgroup quality, the search space is pruned by discarding every specialization of this interval pattern. Our second implemented technique is the coupling of forward checking and branch reordering. Given an interval pattern, the set of all its direct specializations (application of a right or left minimal change on each interval) are computed -forward checking -and those whose optimistic estimate is higher than the best subgroup are stored (Line 8). Branch reordering by descending order of the optimistic estimate value is then carried out (Line 14). Branch reordering enables to explore the most promising parts of the search space first.

We infer that the information loss inherent to the attribute discretization is responsible for the poorer results obtained with SD-Map * . Next, we compare the run times of OSMIND and SD-Map * to quantify the cost of optimality. We generate datasets -made of plant growth simulations -with sizes ranging from 10 to 10000 objects. While SD-Map * and OSMIND both find the optimal subgroup in the same amount of time for small datasets, the execution time of OSMIND grows exponentially with the number of objects contrary to that of SD-Map * (>40000 s for OSMIND vs <1 s for SD-Map * with 10000 objects). Let us now use the PCSE environment to generate 1000 random recipes. We then successively select 10, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 recipes from the dataset and we observe the quality of the best subgroup returned for the quality measure q a mean when a = 0.5. Regarding SD-Map * , we use again the discretization that produces the best subgroup. Figure 4 depicts the relative quality of the best subgroup returned by each algorithm for different dataset sizes. With smaller datasets, SD-Map * finds the optimal subgroup despite the use of discretization. However, as datasets get larger, SD-Map * returns consistently 10% to 25% worse results. Another important qualitative aspect concerns the descriptions of the optimal subgroups found by OSMIND and SD-Map * . Table 4 depicts these descriptions for dataset RecipesA. Besides the higher quality of the subgroup returned by OSMIND, its description also enables to extract much more information than the description obtained with SD-Map * . In fact, where SD-Map * only offers a strong restriction on attribute Irrad P 2 , OSMIND provides actionable information on 5 of the 9 considered attributes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 240, "end": 247, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 705, "end": 711, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1797, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF6"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2213, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Empirical Validation"}, {"text": "Let us finally introduce our use case on urban farm recipe optimization that is studied in [17] . We do not have access to real farming data yet but we found a way to support our application scenario thanks to the inexpensive experiments enabled by the simulator PCSE. In an urban farm, plants grow in a controlled environment (e.g., temperature, CO 2 concentration, etc). A growth recipe is the set of development conditions of a plant throughout its growth. In the absence of failure, recipe instructions are followed and an optimization objective can concern the yield at the end of the growth cycle. Table 2 features examples of  Table 4 . Comparison between descriptions of: the overall dataset (DS), the optimal subgroup returned by OSMIND, the optimal subgroup returned by SD-Map * . \"-\" means no restriction on the attribute compared to DS, Q and S denote respectively the quality and size of the subgroup. growth recipes and we can simulate the execution of recipes through the use of the PCSE environment by setting the characteristics (e.g., the climate) of the different stages. We use this simulator to generate 30 recipes with random growth conditions. We focus on 3 variables that set the amount of solar irradiation, wind and rain. The plant growth is split in 3 stages of equal length. We can first check that OSMIND enables the discovery of a subgroup maximizing the yield. Next, we validate the interpretability and actionability of the return results. Table 5 features a comparison between the interval pattern of the overall dataset and that of the optimal subgroup returned by OSMIND. These results illustrate the capacity of OSMIND to discover a recipe subgroup with optimal yield (17819 vs 7256). We can use the description of the optimal subgroup as a new recipe that will lead to higher yields. The optimal interval pattern is easily interpretable and it supports the extraction of non-trivial knowledge. As an example, during the first stage of the growth cycle, the amount of solar irradiation (Irrad P 1 ) that plants undergo seems to have no impact on the optimization of the yield. This can be inferred from the weak restriction applied on the interval of values taken by Irrad P 1 . Domain knowledge confirms: the capacity of plant light absorption is severely limited during the first stage of the growth cycle meaning that the growth cost could be cut down while keeping the same yield by restricting the amount of light used during the beginning of the plant growth.
