At present, the possible role of insects in the spread of AIV is dubious. The objective of the present work was to investigate the potential transmission of LPAIV by persistence of the virus in the alimentary tract of house \u00dfies, Musca domestica L.

The persistence of the two virus strains in the \u00dfies declined with increasing incubation temperatures and incubation periods. Similarly, increased virus uptake by the \u00dfies increased the persistence of virus. Persistence of infective AIV in \u00dfies differed signi\u00decantly between the two virus strains.

In\u00dfuenza A viruses are classi\u00deed into subtypes by the combination of their two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, of which 16 (H1\u00d0H16) and nine (N1\u00d0N9) antigens, respectively, have been recognized (reviewed in Pantin-Jackwood and Swayne 2009). AIV of H5 and H7 subtypes occurs as lowpathogenic (LPAIV) and high-pathogenic (HPAIV) strains, based on their virulence in chickens. The natural reservoir of avian in\u00dfuenza virus is wild aquatic birds within the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes (Stallknecht 2003) , and AIV circulates between wild birds and domestic poultry as well as within poultry \u00dfocks through complex routes that are not fully understood (Alexander 2008) . In domestic poultry, most AIV infections are subclinical or give rise to mild clinical disease. Low-pathogenic isolates of the H5 and H7 subtypes may mutate into highly pathogenic (HP) variants after introduction into fowl, which induce severe, systemic disease with high mortality (Swayne and King 2003 , Swayne 2007 , Pantin-Jackwood and Swayne 2009 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 644, "end": 662, "text": "(Stallknecht 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 809, "end": 825, "text": "(Alexander 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1131, "text": "(Swayne and King 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1145, "text": ", Swayne 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1179, "text": ", Pantin-Jackwood and Swayne 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "During outbreaks of HP avian in\u00dfuenza (AI), spread of AIV between poultry \u00dfocks is assisted by human activity, but spread by contact with wild birds also may contribute to dissemination (Alexander 2008) .

The house \u00dfy\u00d5s irregular integument surface may complicate external disinfection by solutions, a potential obstacle which we solved by thermal inactivation.

Because of their high morbidity and mortality, HPAIV do not circulate between wild birds and domestic poultry as does the LP variants. Furthermore, LPAIVs were used in our study for safety reasons because it was not feasible to contain house \u00dfies exposed to HPAIV in the laboratory.

Because chickens capture and eat \u00dfying insects (Hald et al. 1998 , Hald et al. 2008 , \u00dfies foraging on virus-containing feces represent a risk in the spread of disease. Chickens infected with AIV shed virus in secretions and excretions, and although HPAIV typically are found in both feces and respiratory secretions, the primary route of shedding of LPAIV depends on the virus strain (Spickler et al. 2008 ). Viral quantities of 10 3.2 \u00d010 7.9 and 10 5.5 \u00d010 8.1 EID 50 /ml have been reported in cloacal and fecal samples, respectively, from chickens infected in the laboratory with LPAIV H1, H4, and H6 subtypes (Morales et al. 2009 ). Shed titers up to 10 4.5 and 10 4.3 EID 50 /ml have been observed in cloacal swabs from chickens infected with LPAIV H5N1 and H7N2 subtypes, respectively (Swayne and Beck 2005, Spackman et al. 2007 ). In our experiments, high virus doses were used to be able to monitor the persistence over time. Each \u00dfy ingested a minimum dose of 10 3.7 ELD 50 (H5N7) and the pool of \u00deve \u00dfies a minimum total of 10 4.4 ELD 50 , which was suf\u00decient to infect ECEs. Under natural conditions, the dose of virus that a house \u00dfy may ingest when foraging on virus-containing feces will depend on the amount and persistence of shed virus, the \u00dfy\u00d5s hunger state as well as the size of the \u00dfy. Large \u00dfies are expected to uptake more food when foraging than smaller individuals and thus ingest more virus. A female house \u00dfy can ingest a volume to 2\u00d0 4 l (Kobayashi et al. 1999) , and the frequency of foraging depends on factors such as temperature, level of stress and the food source. Although an individual \u00dfy might not ingest a suf\u00decient virus dose to infect a chicken, the uptake of several infected \u00dfies may be critical and lead to infection.
