A population-based prospective pediatric ARI surveillance was established at Khanh Hoa province, Nha Trang, Central Vietnam in 2007.

In Vietnam, all children less than 6 years of age are covered by a free government health insurance. Transportation system in Nha Trang city is considerably good as children living in the study area can reach KHGH within one hour. Therefore, access to medical care is relatively good in the study area. All children from the catchment area admitted to KHGH presenting with cough and/or difficulty breathing were recorded as ARI cases and enrolled in the current study. Written informed consents were obtained from the parents or guardians of the pediatric ARI cases to enroll in the study. Clinical-epidemiological information, chest radiographs result (Chest X-ray), laboratory test data and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were collected from all the participants. The catchment area covered 198,729 individuals living in 42,770 households from 16 communities with 13,631 children less than 5 years of age.
