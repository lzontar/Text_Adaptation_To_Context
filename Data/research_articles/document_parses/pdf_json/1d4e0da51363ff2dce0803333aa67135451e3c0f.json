Although significant advances have been made in the development of vaccines to combat EBOV infection, there are at present no vaccines or effective therapies available for human use. There is clearly a need to develop effective treatments that can be used to respond to outbreaks of EBOV in Africa and to counter acts of bioterrorism that may occur. In addition, the unfortunate death of a Russian scientist after accidental exposure to EBOV [2] underscores the need for medical countermeasures for postexposure prophylaxis.",

Four of these proteins are associated with the viral genomic RNA in the ribonucleoprotein complex: NP, VP30, VP35, and the L protein. The L and VP35 proteins together comprise the polymerase complex, which is responsible for transcribing and replicating the EBOV genome. The L protein provides the RNAdependent RNA polymerase activity of the complex and, thus, is an ideal target for antiviral approaches-not only because its suppression should lead to a nearly total loss of all RNA synthesis, but also because of the absence of similar proteins in mammalian cells.",

However, this invasive procedure appears to have little utility for human use. Several key breakthroughs have highlighted the feasibility of the use of siRNAs as antiviral therapeutics. Researchers have shown that cationic polymers have the ability to promote the successful delivery of siRNA by iv administration in influenza virus-infected mice [12] . More recently, the efficacy of lipid-encapsulated siRNAs targeted to HBV has been demonstrated in an in vivo mouse model of HBV replication [13] . In that study, siRNA targeted to HBV RNA was incorporated into a specialized liposome to form a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle (SNALP) and administered to HBV-infected mice. Importantly, the reduction in the quantity of HBV DNA observed was specific and lasted for up to 7 days after administration.

Infection experiments were performed under biosafety level (BSL)-4 biocontainment.

However, in this experiment, the guinea pigs were not treated with siRNA before the ZEBOV challenge. Rather, treatment was initiated 1 h after the challenge, and additional treatments were administered daily on days 1-6 after infection. Plasma viremia levels, which peak on day 7 in this guinea pig model [14] , were not detected on day 7 in any of the guinea pigs treated with the siRNA pool but ranged from \u223c3.5 to 4.5 log 10 pfu/mL in the control guinea pigs (figure 5A). One guinea pig treated with the siRNA pool died on day 6, most likely because of toxicity, given that we were unable to demonstrate the presence of infectious ZEBOV in this animal. Another guinea pig from this treatment group had to be euthanized on day 26; this death could not be attributed to viral replication either. The remaining 3 guinea pigs treated with the siRNA pool did not show any evidence of illness and survived the ZEBOV challenge, whereas all 5 of the control guinea pigs died or were euthanized by day 13 (figure 5B).",

The immunostimulatory properties of the siRNA-containing SNALPs were examined directly after iv administration in mice. Strikingly, all of the SNALP-formulated siRNAs, including the irrelevant scrambled sequence, induced IFN-a and IFN-b in the serum of the injected mice ( figure 7) . Both the guinea pigs and mice that were treated with the immunostimulatory SNALPs showed symptoms of systemic toxicity, including a transient decrease in body weight and piloerection (data not shown), that have previously been shown to be associated with siRNA-mediated stimulation of the mammalian innate immune system [13, 36] . These adverse effects were not evident in the control animals treated with PBS or in the animals injected with empty liposomes or naked siRNA. Of note, EK1, which conferred the greatest benefit when used to treat ZEBOV-infected animals, was the least immunostimulatory of the siRNAs examined.

Although a number of postexposure treatments have shown promise in rodent models of EBOV HF [39] [40] [41] , none has shown any success in nonhuman primates. To date, the only postexposure treatment that has been shown to protect nonhuman primates after challenge with ZEBOV is a strategy designed to modulate the manifestations of disease rather than to block replication of the virus; in a study in rhesus monkeys [42] , we demonstrated that a postexposure strategy to mitigate the coagulation disorders that typify EBOV infection improved survival from 0% to 33%.

Specifically, as noted above, several previous studies have shown complete postexposure protection of mice [39, 40] and guinea pigs [41] against a lethal ZEBOV challenge; however, in each of these cases, the rodents were not protected against viremia. Subsequent transition of these strategies to nonhuman primates was uniformly unsuccessful in protecting macaques against a lethal infection [43, 44] . This suggests that the inability to completely inhibit viremia in rodents predicts an unfavorable outcome in nonhuman primates. In the present study, after administration of the EK1 siRNA, we were unable to detect viremia in any of the ZEBOV-challenged guinea pigs. Clearly, this observation does not guarantee success of the SNALP-based siRNA approach in nonhuman primates; on the other hand, it does offer some hope that the prospects for success are at least improved.",
