Using three criteria of research quality -rigour, originality and significance -it is shown how developing scenarios and analysing their implications present new, important research opportunities for PSM academics, practitioners, and leaders of the profession. Researching the future of PSM supports the identification of uncertainties and anticipates change across many units and levels of analysis of interest to PSM scholars and practitioners, such as the profession/discipline, markets/sectors, or organizations. Scenarios are particularly effective for: considering how the complex interaction of macro-environmental factors affects the PSM context; avoiding incremental thinking; surfacing assumptions and revealing significant blind spots. PSM research using scenarios aligns with Corley and Gioia's (2011) call for prescience-oriented research in which academics aim for more impactful research, enhancing sense-giving potential and theoretical relevance to practice to better perform their adaptive role in society.",

Looking back at past research on the future of PSM reveals a set of articles which is limited both in terms of the number of studies and the range of methods used. The purpose of this article is to encourage more research on the future of PSM, and advocate for a wider range of methods especially suited to futurefocused research. The scenario planning approach is explained and positioned in the repertoire of methodologies available for exploring the future of PSM which predominantly has been conducted via desk research, interviews and surveys. The focus of this article is on research that is specifically about anticipating how (some aspect of) PSM will 'be' in the future, rather than exemplar cases which can frame aspirations for PSM development in a less capable firm, or the implications for future practice and research that conclude most academic papers. Future of PSM research can be broad in scope, for example digitalisation of PSM (Legenvre, Henke and Ruile, 2020) or more specific, for example concerning competences for public procurement personnel (Bals, Schulze, Kelly and Stek, 2019) .",

In uncharted territory, or situations requiring a longer temporal framing such as PSM's role in mitigating the climate emergency, research grounded in predictive methods may provide insufficient data to help navigate future unknown challenges; they reduce our ability to identify the significance of future inter-related issues and research agendas (Thor\u00e9n and Vendel, 2019) .

Other methods include, for example, Delphi study (Seuring and M\u00fcller, 2008) , and other methods are sometimes used in combination with scenario planning 1 . Its importance is increasingly recognised across all fields, including natural sciences and engineering. As discussed in Nature, top-down approaches such as modelling need to be complemented by bottom-up participatory methods to promote stakeholder engagement and to explore the possible societal consequences of technological change (Contestabile, 2013 , Conway, Nicolls, Brown and et al, 2019 , Editorial in Nature, 2018 . Between 2014 and 2019, the US National Science Foundation funded 10 projects worth $6.45 million, with 'scenario planning' listed as a key term. For the same period, the main Web of Science indexes (SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A&HCI) lists 729 articles with topic = 'scenario planning', of which 174 are in business and management journals. In business and management, much of the research concerns firms and their strategies. Other units and levels of analysis are however also found in future studies. For example, the topics of the 67 articles include: impact of 3D printing on supply chains (Ryan, Eyers, Potter, Purvis and Gosling, 2017) ; the Internet of Things and supply chain (Pishdar, Ghasemzadeh, Antucheviciene and Saparauskas, 2018) ; system dynamics in the clothing sector (Serrano, Rodrigues, Lacerda and Paraboni, 2018) . All these studies demonstrate an orientation towards 'prescience' which -in management studies -is \"a way of achieving scope and fulfilling our scholarly role of facilitating organizational and societal adaptiveness\" (Corley and Gioia, 2011: :12) .",

Prediction is often limited to short time frames and, even then, unexpected events occur. Paradoxically, these challenges increase the importance of future-orientated research (May, 1982) , to help scholars anticipate and conceptualise potential problem domains, expose assumptions (Corley and Gioia, 2011) , and present new research directions that may fundamentally shape future debate and theory (Ahuja and Morris Lampert, 2001) . In environments with exponential or disruptive change, influence is not confined to traditional lines of communication or power structures (Pang, 2010) , and it can be hard to pay attention to issues whose unintended consequences play out in the long term on a global scale (Pang, 2011) .",

Those conducting prescience-oriented research engage with reflexive participants to transform today's thinking and practice (Cunliffe and Scaratti, 2017, MacIntosh, Beech, Bartunek, Mason, Cooke and Denyer, 2017) . As with engaged scholars (B\u00e4ckstrand and Halld\u00f3rsson, 2019) and action researchers (Maestrini, Luzzini, Shani and Canterino, 2016, Meehan, Touboulic and Walker, 2016) they are not just bystanders or observers. Through their research, they aim to perform an adaptive role in society, rather than a maintenance one (Corley and Gioia, 2011: : 20) . More radical prescient theorising can introduce new research agendas and trajectories (Corley and Gioia, 2011) that have the potential to transform a field's development (Nadkarni, Gruber, DeCelles, Connelly and Baer, 2018) . Through performative theory development, they can shape environments Gehman, 2016, Garud and Gehman, 2019 (Schoenherr, Modi, Benton, Carter, Choi, Larson, Leenders, Mabert, Narasimhan and Wagner, 2012) , internal integration (Mogre, Lindgreen and Hingley, 2017) , purchasing skills (Bals et al., 2019, Tassabehji and Moorhouse, 2008) , behavioural dynamics of individual actors (Wieland, Handfield and Durach, 2016) , and ethical purchasing (Wieland et al., 2016) .

The predicted futures include a range of specific cost, service and ethical challenges for PSM, including resource depletion, increasing demand in developing countries, higher customer expectations in traditional markets, and a growth in global competition (Kamann et al., 2016) . At a macro level these changes are driven by global themes of sustainability, risk, humans, innovation, analytics, and complexity (Wieland et al., 2016) .",

These methods have the advantage of collecting and synthesising valuable extant knowledge, but forecasting from extrapolations is problematic and predicting the future, even with the use of experts, is arguably impossible (Tetlock, 2005) . Although survey-based research has engaged academics and PSM professionals in their views of the future, the tendency is to search for consensus (see Wieland et al., 2016, Schoenherr and Speier-Pero, 2015) , which can privilege dominant perspectives and activities and exclude other viable alternatives or plausible futures.

Change is viewed as inevitable (Wieland et al., 2016 ), yet authors tend to assume a stable purpose for PSM in the future with no fundamental changes to its role (Mogre et al., 2017 , Spina et al., 2013 . Whilst emerging areas including services and sustainability are identified (Zheng et al., 2007) , the focus tends to centre on future academic research agendas (Wieland et al., 2016 , Zheng et al., 2007 rather than explicit changes to practice. Most studies do not go as far as to envision what the future might look like and some, whilst acknowledging critical macro-environmental drivers, only consider specific supply chain trends. With the occasional exception of the sustainability agenda, PSM's strategic influence is still largely focused on, and bounded by, organisational outcomes rather than consideration of the wider aggregated consequences of supply-side actions or changes to supply markets. Potentially this masks collective responsibilities and accountabilities, and the emergent effect of cumulative decisions. Current approaches can be unsuitable for work on the future of PSM as they reinforce dominant paradigms and theories. Yet, understanding how and why particular issues and frames become dominant is itself potentially insightful for the field. Scenarios can complement existing methods through exposing the underpinning assumptions and biases in our own models and theories.",

For those trying to make sense of the future, most of these driving forces are 'known unknowns', that is: the force is recognised, but how it will develop and its impact are uncertain. The complexity created by the known unknown dictates the need to anticipate the future via multiple plausible images (scenarios), instead of assuming linear progression of the present, or forecasting specific elements of the environment based on past behaviour. The philosophy of scenario planning has emerged into a methodology that can be applied when examining the external environment and strategizing. The use of scenarios in the anticipation of the future is about sketching out competing futures, which then serve as a mechanism to provoke debate and uncover assumptions. See for example 'Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development' produced by the Rockefeller Foundation and Global Business Network (2010).",

Of these categories, in this article, the focus is on the Intuitive Logic approach that encourages participatory methods to stimulate diverse discussions and uncover different perspectives, and that conceptually distinguishes uncertainty from risk. Unlike risk, uncertainty is not open for probability measurement (Knight, 1921 , Tapinos, 2012 . The Intuitive Logic approach aligns well with researching the future of PSM as the combination of complex driving forces that shape the future of a discipline cannot easily be quantified or modelled.",

The first step sets the scene and frames the process: defining the purpose of the intervention; developing an in-depth understanding of the organisation or concept whose future is examined; and selecting the planning horizon for the scenarios. The second step identifies the wide variety of driving forces for the general/macro environment, through PEST frameworks or similar (Burt, Wright, Bradfield, Cairns and Van Der Heijden, 2006) . In the third step, driving forces are ranked based on their level of uncertainty and impact (see O 'Brien, (2004) for a full description of the ranking and categorisation process). In the fourth step, scenarios are developed either inductively from a few of the uncertainties identified (Frith and Tapinos, 2020) , or deductively pairing uncertainties to create a 2x2 matrix with four scenario themes (Ramirez and Wilkinson, 2016) . In the final fifth stage of scenario development, narratives (as stories of the future) are constructed in order to make the scenarios more accessible to their intended audience (Burnam-Fink, 2015) . The developed scenarios have practical applications in strategic planning and for theory development through surfacing assumptions and gaps in our attention.",

Similarly, breaking out from myopic behaviours is difficult even for very senior leaders who can struggle to 'think the unthinkable' (Gowing and Langdon, 2016) and, when they do, the attention to supply-side aspects is very limited (see, for example Schwab, 2017) . Scholars also identify 'hyperopia' (the condition of paying too much attention to the distant future, neglecting the present and near future) as an additional dysfunction of scenario planning (Mackay and Burt, 2015) . To address these risks a series of mechanisms are developed to support the process including: avoiding fragmentation; making issues explicit; conversation; memorable stories; articulating assumptions; detailed analysis; contrasting scenarios; remarkable people; inductive development; and internal generation (Frith and Tapinos, 2020) .",

Use of these contrasting future viewpoints encourages participants to think holistically and systemically over longer time frames, examining a range of interacting factors (\u00d6born, Bengtsson, Hedenus, Rydhmer, Stenstr\u00f6m, Vrede, Westin and Magnusson, 2013) . Once developed, the scenarios are considered as if they have already occurred (Candy, 2010) , inviting participants to 'become' their future self. In comparison to prediction-based studies, the temporal framing epistemologically distances the present and future; the future as 'now' allows the present to function as an 'other', rather than vice versa (Inayatullah, 1993) (Ravetz, 1997) . Foresight exercises contribute theoretically by creating new knowledge from progressive discussions that reframe issues and challenge implicit assumptions (Dufva and Ahlqvist, 2015) , thus enabling epistemological contributions through identifying knowledge of the future (Piirainen and Gonzalez, 2015) . There have been various criticisms of scenario planning (Mietzner and Reger, 2005) , notably concerning confusion over the proliferation of terms, methods and techniques (Bishop, Hines and Collins, 2007) . The field's response has always been very clear that scenario planning is not a process of calculating a singular future but a creative, participative and strategic conversation that is highly dynamic, requiring judgement, a tolerance of uncertainty (van der Heijden, 2004), and an explicit acknowledgement of values (Voros, 2001) within disciplined, robust processes (Chermack, 2007) .",

However, the most pressing and important issues for PSM are necessarily future-oriented. Consider for example Montabon, Pagell and Wu's ( 2016: p11) highly cited article which sought \"to move the [SCM] field from the question of how can firms merely diminish environmental or social problems to how supply chains can become truly sustainable\". Among many researchers, this shift in attention is understood but not yet realised. PSM scholars can contribute to this conceptual shift through exploring how firms manage commercial transactions within these 'truly sustainable' supply chains. Yet, given the lack of such supply chains in practice, where and how could this research be conducted? As with many aspects of the more radical sustainability agenda, their question lends itself to future-focused research, including scenario planning, to provide a more nuanced analysis of critical uncertainties and the boundaries of PSM's existing theoretical frames.",

It is largely uncertain about its final outcome (or at least about the quantity of time and resources needed to achieve it), it is planned for and budgeted (even when carried out by individuals), and it is aimed at producing results that could be either freely transferred or traded in a marketplace.

Scenarios can be academically significant in terms of developing research agendas, and providing a site for combining knowledge from different fields. They can be seen as descriptive 'theories of the future' -sensemaking resources -which can catalyse more formal theorising, potentially with performative effects (Marti and Gond, 2018) It is important to recognise that scenarios-based research faces a double hurdle in demonstrating its value relative to more traditional methods used in PSM research, since it is both close to practice and future-focused. In this section, to critically assess and illustrate the suitability of scenario planning as a research methodology, the discussion is framed around three research evaluation criteria: rigour, originality and significance. These have been adopted by the UK Government's Research and Innovation department in its regular strategic quality evaluation of all research across all disciplines in all UK universities, known as the Research Excellence Framework (UK REF). These criteria, as well as being relevant to all types of research, help take the discussion beyond the more often used rigour and relevance (Pettigrew, 2001) criteria, to consider also the impact, or influence, of the research (see Table 1 ).",

As with every research project, the integrity of the project relies on clear specification of its aim and systematic execution, which must then be carefully reported (Gioia, Corley and Hamilton, 2013) . As indicated through the examples in Section 5.1, the study may relate to a wide variety of PSM topics, levels, and units of analysis.

Relating to the first step, a recent global study of scenario planning practice (Ramirez, Bhatti and Tapinos, 2020) showed that clarity of the purpose is an essential feature of effective application. For the second step, rigour can be achieved by involving participants with a wide range of backgrounds and expertise in brainstorming the driving forces of future (Cairns and Wright, 2018) . van der Heijden, (2004) focuses on value added by including participants with wider knowledge of the focus of the scenarios who are not necessarily directly linked to the organisation or the researchers developing the scenarios.

Compared to other methodologies deployed in past research (see Section 2), scenario development is more likely to deliver originality in the forms highlighted in the underlined text in Table 1 . Scenario planning is specifically designed to encourage contributors to be imaginative, and to enable a holistic view of complex settings. Scenarios are not predictions to be evaluated by their subsequent accuracy. Rather, images of plausible futures are assessed according to their richness, plausibility and value in framing, strategizing (Ramirez, Churchhouse, Palermo and Hoffmann, 2017) , and sensemaking (Bowman, 2016) . When well executed, the scenario method enables novel insights through revealing assumptions, exposing blind spots and directing our attention to theories in allied fields. Scenarios may lead to reframing practice or, from an academic perspective, can support problematising (Alvesson and Sandberg, 2011, Ramirez et al., 2015) leading to new research avenues.",

Significance is often considered primarily in terms of its scientific utility, and this is often treated as is synonymous with theoretical contribution. The UK REF definition challenges us to take a broader view of significance. The potential significance of scenarios in PSM research is determined by the scenario research's ability to impact and influence either within, or beyond, academia. In the PSM context, impacts can cover, for example, changes to a company's strategic direction, sourcing strategies and practices, a change of policy for a professional association or a public authority. From a sensemaking perspective, more subtle influences could include new shared awareness of taken-for-granted assumptions or consequences of current behaviours (Cassell et al., 2019) , and shifts in norms and discourse, for example notions of stakeholders' interests in procurement, or values reflected in decision making criteria. These changes ultimately then turn back to academics, influencing the issues and topics that are researched and studied. Engaged, future-focused methods are arguably more relevant than ever before. With the goal of encouraging more scholars to work in this more critically-oriented space, this article draws on the long-standing evidence base of futures research in other fields to discuss how scenarios can deliver rigour, originality and significance in PSM research.",

Mass media are dominated by linear projections of how the future will, or will not, be different compared to the past. Optimists speak of a major advance in the evolution of technology and collaboration between nations, while pessimists predict a more isolationist world in which every nation will work for itself with limited international collaborations. Optimists foresee the establishment of new practices (e.g. less travelling, more teleconferences); pessimists predict a great recession, the collapse of the global economy and consequent changes in the political landscape similar to 1930's. Scenario planning today for varying purposes would determine the key driving forces of the future; different focuses would require different planning horizons (e.g. the owner of a SME would look for when the lockdown will be relaxed; while the manager in a multinational would focus on future resource availability and restrictions or macro-political changes following the strengthening or the collapse of global institutions like the World Health Organization.

A scenario planning study of the 'future of PSM in the UK medical equipment manufacturing sector' would review these driving forces (intuitive logic step 2), and select the most critical (step 3) around which to develop the scenarios (step 4 and 5). For example, the two key uncertainties could be supply management digitalisation and degree of change in the supply landscape (as used in Knight and Meehan, 2018) 15 Part of the fundamental functions of science is not just to meticulously develop a better understanding of what is extant or previously occurred, but also to imagine and engage with the unknown and what has not (yet) happened.
