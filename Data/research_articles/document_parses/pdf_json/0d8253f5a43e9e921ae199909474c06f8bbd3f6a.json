To reduce this possible ambiguity regarding literary perception, we consider that literature is regarded as text that employs a vocabulary which may be largely different from that used in common language and that it employs various writing styles, such as rhymes, anaphora, etc. and figures of speech, in order to obtain an artistic, complex, possibly elegant and emotional text [11] .

The model consists of two phases described as follows. In the first phase, the Partially Empty Grammatical Structures (PGSs), each composed by elements constituted either by parts of speech (POS) tags or function words 1 , are generated. A PGS is constructed, through a morphosyntactic analysis made with FreeLing 2 , for each phrase of the corpora cWerther and cCask, described in the Sect. 3. The POS tags of these PGSs are replaced by words during the second phase. FreeLing [14] is a commonly used tool for morphosyntactic analysis, which receives as input a string of text and returns a POS tag as output, for each word in the string. The POS tag indicates the type of word (verb, noun, adjective, adverb, etc.), and also information about inflections, i.e., gender, conjugation and number. For example, for the word \"Investigador\" FreeLing generates the POS tag [NCMS000]. The first letter indicates a Noun, the second a Common noun, M stands for Male gender and the fourth gives number information (Singular). The last 3 characters give information about semantics, named entities, etc. We will use only the first 4 symbols of the POS tags. In the second phase, each POS tag in the PGSs are replaced by a corresponding word, using a semantic approach algorithm based on an ANN model (Word2vec 3 ). Corpus 5KL, described in Sect. 3, was used for training Word2vec, as well as the following parameters: only words with more than 5 occurrences in 5KL were considered, the size of the context window is 10, the dimensions of the vector representations were tested within a range of 50 to 100, being 60 the dimension with the best results. The Word2vec model we have used is the continuous skip-gram model (Skip-gram), which receives a word (Query) as input and, as output, returns a set of words (embeddings) semantically related to the Query.

These content words provide most of the information in any text, regardless of their length or genre [2] . Our hypothesis is that by changing only content words, we simulate the generation of phrases by homo-syntax: different semantics, same structure.

(2) , (3), (4) and (5), used to generate the final phrases of our generator, reflect the psychological traits and emotions of the characters in the corresponding works. The results are encouraging, as the model generates grammatically correct sentences. The phrases also associate well with the established context, and perceived emotions correspond, in good part, to the emotions transmitted in the literature involved. In the case of The Cask of Amontillado, the perceived emotions seem not to resemble the author's main moods. This may be due to the fact that, in this short story, the dialogues of the main character are happy and carefree, the tragic murder occurring only in the end. When characters in a literary text have different psychological traits, the semantic analysis of the generated phrases may show heterogeneous emotional characteristics. Experiments with characters showing more homogeneous psychological traits, such as the melancholic, suicidal tendencies of Werther in The Sorrows of Young Werther, more easily detect emotions (as sadness and love) associated with a dominant psychological trend portrayed by the author.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 496, "end": 499, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions and Future Work"}, {"text": "Although there was a poor evaluation for the Coherence criterion, it is possible to argue that coherence is not a dominant feature of literature in general, and most of the generated sentences were perceived as literary. The model is thus capable of generating grammatically correct sentences, with a generally clear context, that transmits well the emotion and psychological traits portrayed by the content and style of an author. In future work, we consider extending the length of the generated text by joining several generated sentences together. The introduction of rhyme can be extremely interesting in this sense, when used to produce several sentences to constitute a paragraph or a stanza [9] .
