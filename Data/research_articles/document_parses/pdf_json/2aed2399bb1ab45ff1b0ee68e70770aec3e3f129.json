            "text": "Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) is associated with satellite (sat) RNAs (sat-RNA D, sat-RNA F), defective interfering (DI) RNAs (DI RNA G, DlI RNA), and one RNA with properties of both sat-RNAs and DI RNAs (sat-RNA C). When plants were inoculated with TCV, sat-RNA D and in vitro sat-RNA C transcripts containing non-viable mutations in the 5' domain, recombinant sat-RNAs were recovered. These recombinants were composed of sat-RNA D at the 5' end and sat-RNA C sequences at the 3' end. Analysis of 20 independent recombination junctions revealed that unequal crossing-over had occurred in planta in a region of sequence similarity between the two sat-RNAs which resulted in the duplication of 3-16 nucleotides. Thirty percent of the sat-RNA recombinants also had one to three additional nucleotides inserted at the crossover junctions which did not correspond to either sat-RNA C or sat-RNA D sequence. The right side of the recombination junctions always began with one of three consecutive nucleotides of sat-RNA C. Based on the similarity between this sequence of sat-RNA C, the right side junction of DI RNA G and the 5' end of TCV, as well as the sequence similarity between right side junctions of DlI RNA and sat-RNA C and the 5' end of the sat-RNAs, a replicase-driven copy choice mechanism is proposed. The replicase, while replicating viral or subviral minus strands, can dissociate from the template along with the nascent plus strand and reinitiate synthesis at one of two internal replicase recognition sequences on the same or different template thus generating recombinant sat-RNAs or DI RNAs.",

            "text": "Recombination among RNA genomes has been described for a number of viruses including picornaviruses (Cooper et al., 1974; King et al., 1982) and coronaviruses (Lai et al., 1985) . RNA recombination can be either homologous, where the two parental genomes are related and the crossover event occurs at the same location in both RNAs thereby preserving any open reading frames, or non-homologous, where these restrictions do not apply (for a review, see King, 1988) . Homologous recombination is very precise; analysis of 46 crossover sites in picornavirus recombinants revealed no insertions, deletions or mismatched bases (King, 1988) . Furthermore, homologous recombination is not sequence-Oxford University Press or structure-specific; 17 different crossover events between foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) subtypes occurred randomly throughout the genome (King et al., 1985) , and 13 independent poliovirus recombinants revealed neither striking sequence specificity nor a preference for recombination occurring in regions of high sequence similarity (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986 ). An enzymatic cutting and re-ligation model and a replicase-driven 'copy choice' model have been proposed to explain both types of recombination. According to the copy choice model, the replicase complexed with the nascent RNA strand is released from the template being copied, and synthesis is reinitiated at a new site on a second viral template (Cooper et al., 1974) .",

Recombination in brome mosaic virus, a tripartite, positive (+) sense virus, occurs between similar sequences in the 3' region of each viral RNA, and can result in the duplication of sequences at the crossover junction.

            "text": "Turnip crinkle is a single-stranded, positive (+) sense virus which has been classified as a member of the carmoviruses (Morris and Carrington, 1988) . Unlike other animal or plant viruses examined to date, TCV supports the replication of a variety of linear small RNAs: (i) satellite (sat) RNAs (Altenbach and Howell, 1981; Simon and Howell, 1986) which are small, single-stranded molecules, do not function as mRNAs, and require a helper virus for replication and propagation; (ii) defective interfering (DI) RNAs (Li et al., 1989) , derived almost exclusively from helper virus sequence; (iii) chimeric RNAs (Simon and Howell, 1986) , composed of sat-RNA sequence at the 5' end and viral sequence at the 3' end ( Figure 1 ). TCV isolate TCV-M supports two avirulent 194 bases; sat-RNA F, 231 bases) which differ mainly by a 36 base insert located near the 3' end of sat-RNA F, and one chimeric RNA (sat-RNA C, 356 bases), which produces severe symptoms when inoculated along with helper virus on a variety of host plants (Li and Simon, 1990) . The 5' 190 bases of sat-RNA C share 88% similarity with full-length sat-RNA D while the 3' 166 bases share 94% similarity with two regions at the 3' end of TCV (Simon and Howell, 1986) . DI RNA G (346 bases), normally associated with the TCV-B isolate, is a mosaic molecule composed of 21 nucleotides of unknown origin at the 5' end as well as 5' and 3' viral segments and a centrally repeated block of viral sequence (Li et al., 1989) . DI1 RNA (383 bases) was generated de novo following inoculation of plants with material derived from in vitro synthesized viral transcripts (TCV-B isolate), and contains the exact 5' and 3' ends of TCV as well as an internal viral sequence (Li et al., 1989) . Both monomeric Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of sequence similarities between TCV and associated RNAs. TCV isolate TCV-M (formerly TCV WT) contains sat-RNAs C, D and F (Simon and Howell, 1986) . Isolate TCVB (formerly TCV-T) is associated with sat-RNA D and DI RNA G. DII RNA was generated de novo after inoculating turnip with cloned viral material (Li et al., 1989) . Similar sequences are shaded alike. Arrows of similar size represent repeated sequences. Numbering in the DI RNAs and sat-RNA C refer to the positions of TCV-related sequence. The sequence of the viral genomic RNA has only been determined for TCV-B (Carrington et al., 1989) and it is not known what differences, if any, exist between the two isolates. and multimeric forms of the sat-RNAs and DI RNAs are normally found in infected tissue.",

Crossover events occur in a region which is related, but not identical, in the two RNAs. Based on the location of 20 independent recombination sites, and the previously determined sequences at the junction sites in the DI RNAs and sat-RNA C, we have formulated a model which accounts for the production of sat-RNA recombinants. Our model involves a copy choice mechanism coupled with recognition by the replicase of specific initiation signals on minus (-) strand RNA templates. Such a mechanism also explains the origin of the chimeric sat-RNA C and the formation of DI RNAs.",

Two to three weeks post-inoculation with transcripts derived from these constructs, total RNA was extracted from leaves and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. An RNA which migrated slightly more slowly than the wild-type sat-RNA C was present in each plant regardless of the size of the inoculated transcript ( Figure 2B ). Attempts were made to sequence this RNA species from individual plants using primer extension, dideoxynucleotide chain termination methods (Carpenter and Simon, 1990) . Although the oligonucleotide used for the sequencing reaction (complementary to nucleotides 196-212 of sat-RNA C) hybridized to the new RNA species and the oligonucleotide sequence was extended with reverse transcriptase, the sequence of the RNA species could not be determined due to heterogeneity of the RNA (Figure 3 ). The sequence heterogeneity began precisely at nucleotide 176, 20 bases upstream from the oligonucleotide primer used in the sequencing reaction.",

Sequence analysis of the cDNA clones revealed that the RNA species accumulating in each of these plants contained sat-RNA D sequence at the 5' end joined to sat-RNA C sequence at the 3' end. The exact location where the homology to sat-RNA D ended and the sat-RNA C specific sequence began (i.e. the site of recombination) could be determined by virtue of the imprecise nature of the event ( Figure 4A ). The right side of the recombination junction point was always one of three consecutive nucleotides in sat-RNA C (bases 175-177), indicating a preference for a specific sequence in the recombination event. Eighteen out of 20 independent recombination events occurred between nucleotides 180 and 183 of sat-RNA D and bases 175-177 in sat-RNA C. The inexact crossover events resulted in the duplication of three to six nucleotides in the sat-RNA recombinants. Two cDNA clones contained the complete sequence of sat-RNA D joined at the 3' end to base 175 or 177 of sat-RNA C ( Figure 4B ). Curiously, between one and three additional nucleotides had been inserted at the crossover junction in seven of the recombinant sat-RNAs. These additional nucleotides were all uridine residues with the exception of one insert of AUU. cDNA clones derived from recombinant sat-RNAs with different crossover points and/or additional nucleotides could be isolated from individual plants, thereby accounting for the original observation of heterogeneity in the RNA.",

The first model involves the breakage and joining of postreplication RNAs using a mechanism which might resemble the trans-splicing reaction thought to occur in Caenorhabditis elegans (Krause and Hirsh, 1987) , trypanosomes (Murphy et al., 1986) and Chlamydomonoas reinhardtii chloroplasts (Choquet et al., 1988) . Trans-splicing, as described in these systems, is similar to cis-splicing in its requirement for specific splicing signals. The second model suggests that recombinant and DI RNA formation occur during replication of the RNAs, when the replicase, while copying the original template, detaches along with the nascent daughter strand, and reestablishes synthesis downstream on the same template (forming DI RNAs) or on a second template (forming recombinants). Using temperatureand chemical-sensitive poliovirus parental RNAs, Kirkegaard and Baltimore (1986) demonstrated that template switching of the replicase during (+) strand synthesis was responsible for the generation of poliovirus recombinants.",

Before the replicase releases the nascent (+) strand, it reinitiates synthesis at a recognition signal on the same or a different (-) strand template. Recombinant sat-RNAs are formed if the replicase dissociates from sat-RNA D after completing or nearly completing (+) strand synthesis and reinitiates synthesis at a replicase recognition signal (motif 1) on the (-) strand of sat-RNA C ( Figure 6A ). DI RNAs are formed if the replicase, while synthesizing new TCV (+) strands, dissociates from the template and reinitiates synthesis on the same or a second molecule of TCV (-) strand at either a motif 1 or motif 2 sequence ( Figure 6B ). This model also accounts for the original formation of sat-RNA C ( Figure  6C ). When replication of sat-RNA D (-) strand was completed, the replicase along with the nascent daughter strand reinitiated synthesis at the motif 2 sequence at TCV base 3764. After synthesis of an additional 15 nucleotides, the replicase released from the TCV template and reinitiated synthesis at a second motif 2 sequence at TCV base 3898, thus generating a sat-RNA -DI RNA hybrid molecule. The presence of short stretches of homologous nucleotides on both sides of most junctions may be important in aiding the replicase -nascent strand complex to position itself correctly at an internal replicase recognition signal. The occurrence of short homologous sequences on both sides of six out of seven junctions is not likely to be random. However, caution should be used in interpreting this observation since several other repeated sequences of five or six nucleotides can be found scattered throughout sat-RNA C and sat-RNA D.",

This insert consists of a 20 nucleotide segment of unknown origin, which shares no similarity with either motif 1 or motif 2, followed by a 16 nucleotide repeat of the sequence directly upstream from the insert. Because of the unusual composition of the inserted sequence, a mechanism separate from the one described in Figure 6 may have been responsible for the formation of sat-RNA F. Our model also does not explain the origin of the 5' 21 nucleotides of DI RNA G. The first 10 nucleotides of DI RNA G and sat-RNA F are identical. However, the following 11 nucleotides of DI RNA G share little similarity with either TCV genomic or subviral RNAs (Li et al., 1989) . The sequence surrounding TCV base 43, where the homology between DI RNA G and TCV begins, does not resemble either motif 1 or motif 2. It therefore seems likely that additional uncharacterized mechanisms may contribute to the formation of TCV associated subviral RNAs. The replicase-driven copy choice model described in Figure 6 can account for the normal accumulation of linear sat-and DI RNA multimers in infected plants. After completing synthesis of a full-length sator DI RNA (+) strand, the replicase, before releasing the newly synthesized strand, could initiate a second round of replication either using the same template or a second homologous template thus generating tandemly copied multimeric species. Circular sat-RNAs (virusoids) are thought to replicate by a 'rolling circle' mechanism whereby higher order multimers undergo a self-cleavage reaction (Prody et al., 1986; Forster and Symons, 1987) . However, circular forms of linear sat-RNAs, such as the TCV sat-RNAs or cucumber mosaic virus sat-RNA, have not been found (Linthorst and Kaper, 1984; A.E.Simon, unpublished) nor has self-cleavage been found to occur (A.E. Simon, unpublished) .",

In four of these seven recombinant sat-RNAs, the nucleotides preceding (sat-RNA D sequence) and following (sat-RNA C sequence) the additional nucleotide(s) are different, thereby arguing against a replicase stuttering-type mechanism (Schwer et al., 1987; Thomas et al., 1988) . One explanation is that the TCV replicating enzyme, while detached from a template with the nascent daughter strand, is able to polymerize nucleotides without a template. It is interesting to note that natural dimers of sat-RNA C (Simon and Howell, 1986) and DI RNA G (this report) can also have one or two additional residues at the junction between monomers. Since we believe that formation of multimers and sat-RNA recombinants are different manifestations of the same process, the ability to add additional nucleotides to the junction may be an intrinsic property of the replicase.",

DIs and/or viral recombinants of vesicular stomatitis virus (Yang et al., 1983; Meier et al., 1984) , poliovirus (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986; Kuge et al., 1986) and mouse hepatitis virus (Baric et al., 1987; Makino et al., 1988) have no sequence homology between different joining sites, but may be generated in regions of high secondary structure (Baric et al., 1987; Wilson et al., 1988) . However, Re et al. (1985) have proposed a similar copy choice/replicase recognition signal model for the generation of Sendai virus DI RNAs during replication of the infectious (-) strand template based on their finding of pyrimidine rich, putative promoter signals on only one side of all junctions. These signals are similar to a sequence located 5-16 nucleotides from the 3' end of Sendai virus. As noted in our results, the right side junction sequences of the TCV sat-RNAs and recombinants are purine rich. However, since our model predicts that recombinants and DIs are formed while the (-) strand is being copied, the proposed signal recognized by the replication enzyme is actually the pyrimidine rich complement. It is interesting to note that direct evidence for poliovirus recombinants (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986) and indirect evidence in the Sendai virus and TCV systems suggest that polymerase template switching occurs during synthesis of only one RNA strand. Template availability or structural differences between the two strands may contribute to this limitation.",

Recombination in this system has several characteristics not previously detected. First, crossover points between sat-RNA D and the related sequence in the 5' half of sat-RNA C have only been found at two sites: 14-16 nucleotides from the 3' end of sat-RNA D, or the very 3' end of sat-RNA D, and nucleotides 175-177 of sat-RNA C. Secondly, seven out of 20 recombinant events resulted in the addition of non-template encoded residues. Since homologous recombination has been defined as a precise yet random exchange between related viral genomes, recombination between TCV sat-RNAs can be considered to be non-homologous. Non-homologous recombination has only been reported in two systems: Sindbis virus, where cellular tRNA sequences can be found joined to Sindbis DI RNAs (Monroe and Schlesinger, 1983) , and brome mosaic virus, where duplicated sequences have been found at junctions (Bujarski and Kaesberg, 1986) .",

In these cases, recombination would not be detected due to the abundance of infectious, unrecombined sat-RNA. Although it is not known why some viruses are able to generate DI RNAs and/or recombine RNAs, this process allows the 'correction' of deleterious mistakes in sat-RNA C by recombination with the similar region in sat-RNA D. TCV is then able to associate with an infectious, near-normal sat-RNA C. Since recombinant sat-RNAs are almost always recovered in infections where sat-RNA C contains a non-viable mutation in the 5' domain, association with a normal or near-normal sat-RNA C may confer a selective advantage on TCV in virus replication, packaging or spread.",
