Vasoplegia accounts for severe hypoxemia. The normal response to hypoxemia is to increase minute ventilation, primarily by increasing the tidal volume [7] (up to 15-20 ml/ kg), which is associated with a more negative intrathoracic inspiratory pressure. Undetermined factors other than hypoxemia markedly stimulate, in these patients, the respiratory drive. The near normal compliance, however, explains why some of the patients present without dyspnea as the patient inhales the volume he expects. This increase in minute ventilation leads to a decrease in PaCO 2 .",

The possible key feature which determines the evolution of the disease, other than the severity of the disease itself, is the depth of the negative intrathoracic pressure associated with the increased tidal volume in spontaneous breathing. Indeed, the combination of a negative inspiratory intrathoracic pressure and increased lung permeability due to inflammation results in interstitial lung edema. This phenomenon, initially described by Barach in [8] and Mascheroni in [9] both in an experimental setting, has been recently recognized as the leading cause of patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) [10] . Over time, the increased edema increases lung weight, superimposed pressure and dependent atelectasis. When lung edema reaches a certain magnitude, the gas volume in the lung decreases, and the tidal volumes generated for a given inspiratory pressure decrease [11] . At this stage, dyspnea develops, which in turn leads to worsening P-SILI. The transition from Type L to Type H may be due to the evolution of the COVID-19 pneumonia on one hand and the injury attributable to high-stress ventilation on the other.",

In Type L patients with dyspnea, several noninvasive options are available: high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). At this stage, the measurement (or the estimation) of the inspiratory esophageal pressure swings is crucial [13] . In the absence of the esophageal manometry, surrogate measures of work of breathing, such as the swings of central venous pressure [14] or clinical detection of excessive inspiratory effort, should be assessed. In intubated patients, the P0.1 and P occlusion should also be determined. High PEEP, in some patients, may decrease the pleural pressure swings and stop the vicious cycle that exacerbates lung injury. However, high PEEP in patients with normal compliance may have detrimental effects on hemodynamics. In any case, noninvasive options are questionable, as they may be associated with high failure rates and delayed intubation, in a disease which typically lasts several weeks. 3. The magnitude of inspiratory pleural pressures swings may determine the transition from the Type L to the Type H phenotype. As esophageal pressure swings increase from 5 to 10 cmH 2 O-which are generally well tolerated-to above 15 cmH 2 O, the risk of lung injury increases and therefore intubation should be performed as soon as possible.",

Once intubated and deeply sedated, the Type L patients, if hypercapnic, can be ventilated with volumes greater than 6 ml/kg (up to 8-9 ml/kg), as the high compliance results in tolerable strain without the risk of VILI. Prone positioning should be used only as a rescue maneuver, as the lung conditions are \"too good\" for the prone position effectiveness, which is based on improved stress and strain redistribution. The PEEP should be reduced to 8-10 cmH 2 O, given that the recruitability is low and the risk of hemodynamic failure increases at higher levels. An early intubation may avert the transition to Type H phenotype.",

If not available, signs which are implicit in Type L and Type H definition could be used as surrogates: respiratory system elastance and recruitability. Understanding the correct pathophysiology is crucial to establishing the basis for appropriate treatment. Fig. 1 a CT scan acquired during spontaneous breathing. The cumulative distribution of the CT number is shifted to the left (well-aerated compartments), being the 0 to \u2212 100 HU compartment, the non-aerated tissue virtually 0. Indeed, the total lung tissue weight was 1108 g, 7.8% of which was not aerated and the gas volume was 4228 ml. Patient receiving oxygen with venturi mask inspired oxygen fraction of 0.8. b CT acquired during mechanical ventilation at end-expiratory pressure at 5 cmH 2 O of PEEP. The cumulative distribution of the CT scan is shifted to the right (non-aerated compartments), while the left compartments are greatly reduced. Indeed, the total lung tissue weight was 2744 g, 54% of which was not aerated and the gas volume was 1360 ml.
