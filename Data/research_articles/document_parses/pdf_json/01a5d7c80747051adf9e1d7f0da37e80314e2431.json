Although the significance of viral RNA detection in blood likely differs by virus and detection of viral RNA by PCR does not necessarily prove the presence of replicating virus, viral nucleic acid detection in blood is associated with disease severity for both RNA and DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and avian influenza. In our longitudinal study, viral RNA detection in blood occurred in approximately 10% of all patients with influenza and 30% of patients with influenza LRD. Viral RNA in blood was detectable a few days prior to the diagnosis of LRD and was a risk factor for progression of URD to LRD among patients who presented with URD. Influenza viral RNA in blood was associated with hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and overall and influenzarelated death. Furthermore, influenza RNA detection in blood was associated with increased mortality among patients with influenza LRD. Although there have been several reports of influenza RNA detection in blood, the incidence of virus isolation or viral RNA detection in blood is thought to be very low, particularly for seasonal influenza [12] [13] [14] .

The relatively small sample size prevented us from performing models that included all possible risk factors simultaneously, but we formed several different bivariate models that adjusted for other important factors (eg, early initiation of antiviral therapy [<48 hours]). All models showed viremia as a very significant factor for clinically important outcomes (Table 2) . We analyzed preemptive antiviral therapy as a possible factor for outcome based on previous studies. Antiviral therapy consisted largely of oseltamivir, but some earlier cases of influenza A were treated with M2-inhibitors. Finally, we used plasma or serum samples for quantitative RT-PCR, but could not test or culture any cellular components due to the retrospective nature of our study. The optimal blood component for influenza RNA detection has not been defined [12] . Although the serum and plasma samples in our study were not collected specifically for future RNA detection, the influenza RNA detection rate did not decline in older samples and samples were evenly spread throughout the study period.
