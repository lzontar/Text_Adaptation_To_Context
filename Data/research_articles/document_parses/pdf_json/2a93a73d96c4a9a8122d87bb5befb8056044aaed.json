All positive cases so far have been identified through \"passive detection\", as patients presented to healthcare facilities with symptoms [2] . The first four confirmed cases (date of March12 th ) were imported cases who had travelled from France and Italy by plane, highlighting the need for control and prevention measures at points of entry into Senegal. Security at Blaise-Diagne International Airport has been enhanced with the use of thermal imaging cameras to identify passengers with abnormally high body temperatures (\u226538\u02daC), as the first sign of infection is fever. To detect cases as early as possible through health surveillance, we believe that this device should be implemented at all airports, ports and bus stations at the borders, and reinforced by a simple and quick questionnaire to passengers without fever (other Coronavirus disease -19 symptoms include mild cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea) [3] .
