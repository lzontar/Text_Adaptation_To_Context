However, in these studies, RT-PCR was mainly performed on throat swabs, which probably display a lower sensitivity [6] . Indeed, while the optimal sample is not defined for Sars-Cov-2 RT-PCR, nasopharyngeal swabs are more sensitive for influenza viruses [7] . Furthermore, all these studies included RT-PCR designed at the beginning of the pandemic when few viral genomes were already sequenced. Currently, according to WHO recommendations, at least two viral targets should be amplified [8] .",

On admission, all were placed on isolation for suspicion of COVID-19 and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained. Chest CT were rapidly performed in all patients, and revealed no abnormalities. Four patients were discharged with a diagnosis of viral infection not due to Sars-Cov-2. The other 2 required hospital management; one stayed in the pre-admission zone until the RT-PCR result was available, while the other one was transferred to a non-COVID department. Upon receipt of the RT-PCR positive result the discharged patients were contacted and given information about the disease.
