The basic reproduction number R 0 depends on the lockdown and isolation rates. We prove that, R 0 becomes smaller than one if the lockdown and isolation rates are higher and in this case, we have the extinction of the infectious population. We apply our results to the case of Morocco country. In the end we carried out some numerical simulations illustrating our results.",

It is also assumed that 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 and 0 \u2264 \u03b4 < 1 are the lockdown rate of susceptible and isolation rate of infectious, respectively, so the fraction of susceptible that is contained (protected) is (1 \u2212 \u03b1)S and the fraction of non-isolated infectious population is (1 \u2212 \u03b4)I. Lambda is the density of susceptible births. R population contains individuals removed from the transmission chain, the contained individuals given by \u03b1S proportion, the isolated individuals given by t\u03b4I proportion, the cured and the deceased. The mathematical model is given by: In the following we consider the beginning of the disease (March 2 \u2212 8) which corresponds to the case where the number of births is relatively negligible, \u039b = 0, and there is no lokcdown, \u03b1 = \u03b4 = 0. In this case it is assumed that S(t) = S 0 and that the infected cases are only the imported cases, with zero cure and mortality, i.e. \u03b3 = 0. System (4.1) is then written as follows",

To deal with this problem we have subdivided the time period from 2 March to 5 April 2020 into three periods: 1-Beginning of the outbreak (March 2-8): Appearance of a few imported cases. We showed that, in the first period, the transmission rate was low, which explains the moderate growth in the cumulative number of infected population. In the second period, the transmission rate of the epidemic becomes higher, and the cumulative number of infected population increases. In the last phase and taking into account lockdown and isolation, the transmission rate becomes smaller compared to the second phase. Since the basic reproductive number depends on the lockdown and isolation rates, we have shown that if these rates are increased, the number becomes smaller than 1, and larger than 1 otherwise. In conclusion, controlling an outbreak means controlling the lockdown rate of the susceptible and isolation rate of infected, which is confirmed by figures 4, 5 and 6.",
