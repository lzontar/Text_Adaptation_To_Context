Companies and researchers across the world are dedicating their time and effort into finding an effective therapy for COVID-19, but this may take far too long. Patients with severe cases are getting supportive care, managing life threatening symptoms of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The mechanism of action is hypothesized that the zinc ions directly affect template binding. However, in other studies, zinc ions seemed to locate into the mitochondria, and the mechanism of inhibition is unclear. 6 Other studies had noted an inhibitory effect of Zn 2+ on the activity of purified RdRps from rhinoviruses and hepatitis C virus, but not investigated in any detail. 9, 10",

This micronutrient is crucial for maintaining homeostasis of both innate and adaptive immune systems and its deficiency is correlated with compromised immune cell development and functions. 13 One of the major clinical symptoms in zinc deficient patients is depressed immunity, which leads to adverse clinical outcomes including increased infections and frequency of disease. 13 Studies have shown that zinc plays important roles in regulating the activity of immune mediators including cytokine and chemokine activities, contributing to membrane stabilization, and regulating lymphocyte apoptosis. 13 Clinically, the use of zinc has been proven effective against infectious diseases in the human population. After supplementing zinc in the elderly population, there was a significant decrease of infections in 12 months compared to the placebo group. 14 Randomized double blinded placebo-controlled trials have shown that daily zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence and duration of chronic diarrhea by 25-30% 15 , reduce rates of acute respiratory infection up to 45% 16 , and can even decrease the duration of the common cold. 17",

Zinc supplementation also upregulates A20, a zinc containing transcriptional factor, which inhibits the activation of NF-\u03baB 18 which is the prototypical proinflammatory signaling pathway in cellular responses. 19 Downregulating this pathway leads to a decreased generation of inflammatory cytokines.

Given the lack of effective and safe antiviral drugs for COVID-19, we should place more attention in supporting host immune defense, cytoprotection, and immunoregulation. We propose using a combination of Zinc Iodide ( ZnI 2 ) with Dimethyl Sulfoxide for the prevention and treatment of viral infection and sepsis. The therapeutic compound combines the two ingredients ZnI2 and DMSO might have strong synergetic efficacy in controlling symptoms, preventing, and treating all types of viral infections.",

Zinc Iodide-DMSO might also be used as a preventive agent for respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 by boosting the innate immune defense and reducing pathogen infectiveness.",

These compounds have shown efficacy in disrupting the replication pathway, showing antiviral effect. Increasing intracellular Zinc ion and administration of zinc ionophores have been shown to impair replication of a wide range of viruses including et al. demonstrated that two metal ion binding compounds (zinc ionophores), pyrithione and hinokitiol causes a rapid import of extracellular zinc into the cytoplasm. Increased intracellular Zn 2+ concentrations have been shown to efficiently impair replication of RNA viruses by interfering with proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins.
