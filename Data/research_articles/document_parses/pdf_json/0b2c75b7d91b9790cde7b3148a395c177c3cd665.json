Most childhood deaths in hospital often occur within the first 24 h of admission. Many of these deaths are from preventable causes. This study aims to describe the patterns of mortality in children presenting to the pediatric emergency department. Methods: This was a five-year chart review of deaths in pediatric patients aged 7 days to 13 years presenting to the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Tertiary Hospital (TASTH) from January 2012 to December 2016. Data were collected using a pretested, structured checklist, and analyzed using the SPSS Version 20. Multivariate analysis by logistic regression was carried out to estimate any measures of association between variables of interest and the primary outcome of death. Results: The proportion of pediatric emergency department (PED) deaths was 4.1% (499 patients) out of 12,240 PED presentations. This translates to a mortality rate of 8.2 deaths per 1000 patients per year. The three top causes of deaths were pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF) and sepsis. Thirty two percent of the deaths occurred within 24 h of presentation with 6.5% of the deaths being neonates and the most common co-morbid illness was malnutrition (41.1%). Multivariate analysis revealed that shortness of breath [AOR=2.45, 95% CI (1.22-4.91)], late onset of signs and symptoms [AOR=3.22, 95% CI (1.34-7.73)], fever [AOR=3.17, 95% CI (1.28-7.86)], and diarrhea [AOR=3.36, 95% CI (1.69-6.67)] had significant association with early mortality. Conclusion: The incidence of pediatric emergency mortality was high in our study. A delay in presentation of more than 48 hours, diarrheal diseases and shortness of breath were significantly associated with early pediatric mortality.

The incidence of pediatric mortality in this study was lower than the previous studies conducted in Ethiopia [23] [24] [25] [26] . This decrease may be due to improvements in the maternal and child urban health care settings. Despite this low mortality rate, early death less than 24 h after admission 107 (31.7%) was still high albeit, lower than other studies [18, 19, 26, 27] . The majority of pediatric emergency mortality in hospitals was due to preventable diseases within 24 h of admission [12] . This may be due to poor health care seeking behavior, delay in referral, using traditional medicine, and poverty [28] . A study done in Sub-Saharan countries on care-seeking behaviors related to respiratory illness were found that only 30% of Ethiopian children with suspected pneumonia were taken to a health care settings; this was the lowest proportion in the six analyzed countries [29] . Another study identified multiple factors influencing care-seeking behaviors in Ethiopian children including lack of knowledge, delay in recognition of illness severity and household income [30] . The main causes of neonatal death were late-onset sepsis (50.9%), meningitis (24.6%), and pneumonia (10.5%). Previous studies done in Nigeria and Benin identified high rates of sepsis in this age group [20, 21, 31] , which may be due to unclean cord care practices, traditional birth attendant, polluted atmosphere and poor health education among parents [32] . We found that the primary causes of death for the infant and pre-school age groups at TASTH were pneumonia, congestive heart failure, meningitis, and sepsis and hypovolemic shock.

In Ethiopia, pneumonia is an important public health problem for all children, and creates a significant burden of childhood mortality [18, 35] . A health extension program package focused on disease prevention and health education targeting antibiotic treatment for childhood pneumonia might be a solution to decrease deaths from pneumonia. However, there are some challenges in promoting a health extension program package due to knowledge gaps of health extension workers such as misdiagnosis, negligence and inappropriate referrals [36, 37] .
