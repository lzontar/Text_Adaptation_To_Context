In response, interventions such as the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) [4] and specific procedural techniques [5, 6] have been implemented. Healthcare workers that develop suspected or confirmed COVID-19 require selfisolation and may need hospitalisation. The magnitude of this risk is important to: inform clinicians in their daily practice [7] ; demonstrate the ramifications to clinical workforce; and consider the societal implications of nosocomial COVID-19 in healthcare workers.

The reasons for this finding are unclear, and may point to biological differences between men and women, differences in symptom-reporting behaviour, or variations arising from heterogenous sex distributions in our sample. This warrants future research to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we did not detect an association with the use of PPE in accordance with WHO standards, though perhaps the wide range of combinations of PPE reported may have hampered our ability to elucidate any relationship. Regardless, a significant concern highlighted by the data is the insufficient utilisation of PPE in more than 12% of cases.

Self-isolation due to symptoms or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 of potentially a tenth of the workforce involved in tracheal intubation means that institutions should consider building capacity and resilience in workforce planning during this pandemic and thereafter [20] . Diminishing the availability of vital, highly-trained health providers means that institutions may have a shortfall in their capacity to deliver essential healthcare services to both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. At a public health level, household members of these clinicians will also face the requirement for self-quarantine and are at risk of subsequently contracting the disease, thus amplifying the potential implications of healthcare worker infection. Similarly, other patients and the public may also become exposed to clinicians who develop COVID-19, further perpetuating transmission beyond hospital walls. Of note, 7% of healthcare workers have been shown to be asymptomatic viral carriers based on reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction testing [17] and up to 44% may be asymptomatic seroconverters of immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2 [21] . One potential interpretation of these findings could be that our results may be underestimating the infection rate in clinicians involved in tracheal intubation, as a proportion of those without reported COVID-19 outcomes in our study may be asymptomatic carriers. Therefore, policies for regular testing of those at greatest risk to personal and public health may be valuable. This could identify both asymptomatic carriers [17] , as well as healthcare workers whose symptoms may be consistent with COVID-19 but are due to alternative pathology.",

Firstly, we draw data from the largest international prospective database of high-risk aerosol-generating procedures globally that continues to collect surveillance data that can help inform practice.

The follow-up rate of participants after reporting tracheal intubation episodes in our cohort was high, providing validity to our findings. Moreover, the participant characteristics were representative of the",

Finally, we report prospective data that has not been available from any pandemic or epidemic literature to date. Some limitations must be discussed. Firstly, as healthcare workers involved in tracheal intubation may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 from other sources, direct causality linked to tracheal intubations per se cannot be demonstrated. Secondly, asymptomatic seroconversion was not accounted for. Thus, the true incidence of infection may have been underestimated due to the prevalence of asymptomatic carrier states. Similarly, the reporting of critical illness and death was not feasible in the registry, potentially leading to a source of bias. Thirdly, the data were self-reported, which carries inherent pitfalls. However, this possibility is minimised using fixed-choice questions, as well as highly motivated participants reporting their tracheal intubation episodes contemporaneously. Participants continued to document tracheal intubation episodes regularly and recorded weekly outcomes throughout the study duration.",
