The suggested disease agents not only include enteropathogenic viruses [coronaviruses, birnaviruses, entero-like viruses, rotavirus (especially type D) and adenoviruses] but also bacteria (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Bacteroids, and Clostridia) , and protozoa (Cryptosporidia and Cochlosoma) (Barnes and Guy, 1995; Barnes et al., 1996) . 1223 weights fell on the normal growth curve except Group S in Experiment 1.

In both experiments, the less severely afflicted the birds were at the start of the experiment (i.e., L group), the more weight they gained by the end of the experiment compared to the more affected groups. This observation agrees well with the results of the studies conducted by Angel et al. (1990b) , in which day-old Nicholas poults were inoculated with SS inoculum, and growth performance and nutrient retention were measured from 1 to 44 d of age. The inoculation of poults with SS infective material reduced (P < 0.05) weight gain at every age period except the last (37 to 44 d of age). Over time, the SS-inoculated group gained more weight relative to their body weights and had higher gain/BW ratios as compared to the control group.
