Histopathology is not conclusive for either causes and skin lesions like the aforementioned have been reported as side effects in most frequent COVID-19 treatments.Pseudo-chilblain(Figure 1, A, B) were more commonly found in young patients with mild respiratory symptoms and the timing of the onset was highly variable. Although RT-PCR test was negative in most cases, pseudo-chilblain have been related to COVID-19 due to the unusual increase in incidence during warm springtime coinciding with the pandemic 1,3 . The histopathological examination revealed different patterns. Most of them showed focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer and regenerative changes in the epidermis, with perivascular lymphocytic cuffs in the dermis, involving sweat glands, along with thrombi in some of them. One sample revealed perivascular neutrophilic cuffs with noticeable swollen endothelium and epidermal necrosis.
