The information obtained would help prepare us for future infectious disease outbreaks. Outpatients seen during the outbreak completed a validated questionnaire assessing satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction. Additional items assessed included patients' perception of SARS measures and patient demographics. Of 149 patients, 97% had heard of SARS, 92% believed SARS precautions necessary, and 54% believed contracting SARS was possible despite the precautions. Patients were satisfied with doctors wearing masks (97%), temperature checks (97%), and patients wearing masks (96%). Despite the high satisfaction levels with SARS precautions, 24% believed it had adversely affected doctor-patient interaction. With regards to doctor-patient interaction, 94% of patients were satisfied. Patients were most satisfied with the 'information exchange' domain (mean score 3.23 out of 4) compared to other domains ( P < 0.0001, 100.00% confidence) and were less satisfied with the 'empathy' domain compared to other domains ( P < 0.0001, 100.00% confidence). Patients were most satisfied with understanding their treatment plan (100%), doctor being honest (97%) and being understood (96%). Patients were least satisfied with information about caring for their illness (61%), that the visit could be better (59%), and the doctor showing more interest (58%). On multivariate analysis, patients who were less satisfied with SARS measures were significantly less satisfied with doctor-patient interaction ( P = 0.0001). Dissatisfaction with SARS measures was associated with significant dissatisfaction for questions in all domains. Older age and non-breast cancer patients were also less satisfied with doctor-patient interaction. Most (94%) of patients were satisfied with doctor-patient interaction, despite implementation of infectious disease prevention measures. However, patients who were dissatisfied with the SARS precautions had poorer satisfaction. In particular, physician empathy appeared to be most adversely affected.

Of the remaining 186 eligible patients, 174 agreed to participate and 149 questionnaires were returned (response rate of 80%).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "P = 0.02), patients using the English questionnaire ( P = 0.01), patients who have heard of SARS ( P = 0.002), satisfaction with SARS precautionary measures ( P < 0.001), and younger patient age ( P = 0.05). On multivariate analysis, a patient's satisfaction level was reduced as one advanced in age ( P = 0.01), for non-breast cancer patients ( P = 0.04), and for patients less satisfied with the SARS prevention measures ( P < 0.001). For factors found significant on multivariate analysis, we explored the possibility that different factors might impact on different domains of doctor-patient interaction. Age was found to significantly (all P < 0.05) affect questions 11-15 of the questionnaire, which are wholly within the 'interpersonal skills' domain of the instrument. Cancer type affected answers to question 17 only, which also belongs to the 'interpersonal skills' domain ( P = 0.02). Satisfaction with SARS measures was significantly (all P < 0.05) associated with differences in all questions except questions 12 and 20. Thus, satisfaction with all domains appeared to be influenced by perception of SARS precautionary measures. These results are interesting, but should be viewed as hypothesis generating in view of the multiple significance tests performed. Only 21 patients (14%) took the opportunity to voice additional comments (questions 44-45). Of these, 10 gave negative responses, and eight gave positive responses, and three patients gave both positive and negative comments. The negative comments were related to SARS measures in 11 respondents. Problems included patients having to wear masks (3), the no visitor rule (3), long waiting times (2), doctor wearing mask thus difficult to hear (1), taking of patient temperatures (1), and unable to see the same doctor each time because of the week-on, week-off roster (1). One of these patients also mentioned the long route to the radiotherapy centre due to triage being at the hospital front entrance and closure of many entrances and exits: the patient said that this caused her to feel tired and weak. Two patients had negative comments not directly related to SARS precautions: the doctor speaking too fast, appearing insensitive, not interested and looking rushed (1), and language barrier (1). Also of interest was one patient's positive comment: 'My doctor has a genuine interest in me.

Of interest was the fact that in our study, patient age only significantly influenced items within the 'interpersonal skills' domain of the questionnaire. This included questions on whether the patient thought enough information had been provided, whether sufficient opportunity had been given to ask questions and how friendly the doctor was.Also of interest was our finding that non-breast cancer patients were less satisfied with doctor-patient interaction. This was most strongly associated with the 'interpersonal skills' domain, in particular whether the doctor had told the patient enough about how to care for their condition. It is possible that radiation oncologists spend more time counseling breast cancer patients about this aspect compared to other cancer patients, and would be an interesting area for future research.Our study has several potential limitations. First, it should be noted that patients in Singapore, a society with strict societal obedience and reluctance to question authority, might not be representative of patients in other non-Chinese cultures. This would be a very interesting area for future research. Second, as infection control measures will undoubtedly vary depending on the type of infection, the applicability to other disease outbreaks is unknown. As far as we are aware, this is the only evaluation of patient satisfaction in an oncology setting during an infectious disease outbreak. Third, we used the only doctor-patient interaction satisfaction instrument validated for oncology outpatient visits. Although this instrument was developed for Western patients, it has not been specifically validated in Singapore (for either English or Chinese versions). Singapore is unique as it is a very westernized society with English as its working language; however, some elderly patients are not as competent in English. Our Chinese version of the instrument was professionally translated, assessed by our department's Chinese-speaking staff, and cancer and non-cancer patients, to ensure the accuracy, comprehension and face validity.Supporting Chinese instrument validity was the finding that instrument language was not associated with patient satisfaction on multivariate analysis. In addition, the original instrument was validated in an area of Canada 'rich in cultural diversity', including a large Chinese population.23 Our study has implications for our own and other centres,particularly when infection control processes are in place or being contemplated. First, it is apparent that despite dissatisfaction with individual aspects of the doctor-patient interaction, patients were satisfied overall. This was pleasing given the very strict infection control measures that were implemented. It is possible that awareness of the SARS outbreak, and of hospital precautions, might have prepared patients for any impact on doctor-patient interaction. Our multivariate analysis supports this hypothesis: the strongest predictor for satisfaction was a positive perception of SARS precautions. This may support costly public education media campaigns in the future to emphasize the need. In addition, it might be possible to target department-based patient education programs to further increase satisfaction. It is apparent that the 'empathy' domain, which had the lowest overall satisfaction for our patients, could be specifically targeted; in particular, doctors could be educated to show greater interest in patients despite infection control processes. In other domains, doctors could give patients more support for how to care for their condition and try to use more lay terms, particularly where masks already impair effective communication. It appears that older patients and non-breast cancer patients need particular attention in our patient population. It would be interesting to confirm our findings in other cultures, and to investigate why these patient subgroups might be less satisfied. Further research is also indicated to investigate whether targeted interventions can increase satisfaction, and whether the lifting of infection control measures has any impact (positive or negative) on patient satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
