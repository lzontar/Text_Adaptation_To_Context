Yet despite this substantial amount of rainfall (a total of 174.6 mm of rainfall was received as recorded by the IARI), the pollution load in the Yamuna was still high, whereas despite rainfall being minimal in April, 2020, we could still observe the reductions in the concentrations of the polluting parameters and a betterment in the WQI for the datasets of 6th April, 2020 and 14th April, 2020. Moreover, the examined stretch of the River Yamuna lies entirely within the National Capital Territory of Delhi, which is one of the most densely urbanised locales in India. As such, almost the entire stretch of the river here is actually affected almost wholly by anthropogenic factors and the influence of natural causes on water quality variation are quite minimal. This is even more so since the study was conducted during the dry season (and thereby minimal surface dilution of the contaminant load from meteoric water sources). Furthermore no tributaries, apart from sewer drains, come and meet the Yamuna River within this stretch. Thus the reductions observed in the polluting parameters for the 6th April, 2020 and 14th April, 2020 datasets and the corresponding betterment in the WQI may be taken to directly arise from the lockdown situation.",

Since the image dates were not exactly the same, we designated four 'Days' for this comparative analysis (Figure 7) .

The Day 3 output showed the most reductions in reach-wise mean NDTI levels, after more than a month of the lockdown.

By mid-May, 2020, the Indian Government had lifted lockdown measures and some industries had resumed, depending on the COVID-19 infection rate and case numbers in different areas.

Drain effluents also revealed similar reductions in pollutant loads while the most polluting drains in this reach were identified. A marked drop in the river's turbidity and SPM was also apparent. Some data limitations have constrained the performed analyses but the fact that the Yamuna's water quality has bettered, could be clearly established. However, despite such improvements, the WQI status could not meet the prescribed CPCB standards. The framework adopted in this study can be easily transferred to not only examine similar lockdown effects on the stream quality of large rivers in other areas, but also for continuous monitoring from integrated measured sample and image-extracted datasets, which can extend and improve spatio-temporal water quality assessments. The COVID-19 global pandemic is a once in a generation occurrence that is currently plaguing the world. Yet, one of its outfalls also presents a similarly once in a generation opportunity to re-comprehend and redesign existing frameworks and put in place robust mechanisms to cleanse one of India's most polluted rivers and the nation's other similarly afflicted watercourses.",

Till 2nd July, 2020, over 10.5 million positive cases have been reported worldwide, with 512842 deaths (WHO 2020c)://www.covid19india.org/). With infections rising swiftly and no vaccine/treatment yet formulated, most nations had called for immediate and widespread lockdowns to curb the virus' transmission. The Indian Government had similarly implemented a complete lockdown since the midnight of 24 March, 2020 (The Lancet 2020), to restrict the contagion's spread. With work halting in factories/industries, closing of commercial establishments and transportation systems almost at a standstill, an obvious result J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f substantiated by a number of studies, all based on point sampling of the river at select locations within the above two Barrages, which have ascertained the Water Quality Index (WQI) (e.g. Sharma and Kansal 2011a; Saini and Sonkar 2015; Sharma et al. 2017; Roy and Ghosh 2019). Industrial effluents and the discharge of domestic sewage through drains (Bharadwaj et al. 2017; Parihar et al. 2019), improper location of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and inconsistencies between their operating capacities (of the 41 STPs installed some are at times non-operational due to power cuts and technical/maintenance issues) and the actual sewage amounts generated are the usual primary causes for such heightened pollution levels (Jain 2009; Upadhyay et al. 2011; Kumar et al. 2018), with periodic spikes being recorded in the aftermath of idol immersions post religious festivals (Kaur et al. 2013).

A water sample's quality is thus defined in terms of its physical, chemical and biological parameters (Abbasi and Abbasi 2012; Kachroud et al. 2019). First devised by Horton for the U.S. in 1965, it has emerged as one of the simplest and most efficient means of depicting the overall water quality (Tyagi et al. 2013). The different measured variables are standardised and converted into a composite number that best denotes the suitability of use of a particular water sample (Kumar and Dua 2009",

The augmentation of FC at Palla (m1) is primarily due to livestock excreta in drainage ditches and a mixture of agricultural runoff flowing in from outside the Delhi NCT area (Gopal and Chauhan 2007; Kumar et al. 2019; Sharma 2015), with the pollutant diuron (used as aherbicide/pesticide during sugarcane production whose cultivation is widespread in the area) being especially present in this stretch(Glorian et al. 2018).

Drains d2, d3 and d4 meet the River just after Khajori Paltoon Pool (m3) while drains d21, d22, d23 and d24 meet it after the Okhla Barrage, either directly or as tributaries of the Shahdara drain (Figure 1b). Drains d16 and d17 merge into the Agra Canal and while not directly polluting the Yamuna, they likely have debilitating effects on its adjacent riparian tracts within Jaitpur. Therefore, the uppermost (downstream of Wazirabad Barrage and till Kudesia Ghat-as ascertained in section 3.2) and lowermost segments (after Okhla Barrage) of the Yamuna within Delhi are its most affected reaches. A lower drain density and inflow points in the intervening reaches may allow a slightly better river water quality therein, with only one most polluting drain (d12) meeting the Yamuna in this stretch (just after the ITO Barrage). Interestingly, the Najafgarh drain (d1 inFigure 1b), which is traditionally regarded as the most polluted drain in Delhi (CPCB 2006), does not fall within Cluster 3 in either assessment period. This drain courses across densely urbanized central and southwestern Delhi (NRSC 2019) and has a large network of subsidiary drains, some of which have been treated recently (Adak 2017a), while others may have received much reduced effluent loads during the lockdown as they traverse the temporarily closed industrial belts of Gurugram and Manesar alongside Delhi (Jha 2020). The above reasons could be operative behind this drain being recorded in a slightly lower polluting category. The changing cluster membership of the individual drains during the pre and ongoing lockdown phases also points to an overall betterment of the pollution state [9 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Negative NDTI values denote relatively clearer water, while values above 0.2 represent quite turbid reaches (Lacaux et al. 2007; Subramanium and Saxena 2011). The Yamuna usually demonstrates moderate turbidity signatures (NDTI between 0.0 -0.2) in its sections along Palla and downstream of the Okhla Barrage (Figure 5a). At times, sustained stretches between these two extreme points also show higher NDTI values (most prominently on 22.04.2017-Figure S2) and some sections just downstream of the Wazirabad Barrage show turbid signatures on almost all dates. Such attributes of the above reaches can be accorded to two primary reasons-inflow of agricultural runoff (around Palla) and the inflow from drains around Wazirabad and Okhla, as documented previously. Two sections usually show lower NDTI values (portions immediately upstream of the Wazirabad and Okhla Barrages), possibly from flow stagnation due to the river being impounded and thereby a settling of the suspended load. Most notably, in the last two outputs (for 30.04.2020 and 16.05.2020-Figure 5a), this clearer water portion (i.e. negative NDTI values) extends and covers a considerable section between these two Barrages and the sections immediately downstream of the Wazirabad Barrage have also cleared up. This may seemingly be attributed directly to the lowering of industrial effluents during the lockdown. Domestic effluent inflow means that some spots of positive NDTI values remain just along those sections where the principal polluting drains meet the Yamuna. The moderate NDTI values around Palla are likely due to unabated runoff from fields.",

            "text": "rest of the month, it could provide a possible explanation for the noted rise in the NDVI at the end of April, 2020. The situation seems to have bettered again for the 16.05.2020 output (possibly due to greater inflow from the Barrage), with it being more similar to the 29.03.2020 output (Figures 5b). The anthropogenic influence on the Yamuna's water quality in this stretch is thus quite clear and with the two NDVI outputs for the end of February, 2020 and mid-May, 2020 being the least affected by this signature in all 16 datasets(Figure 5band S3), the lockdown's impact becomes apparent. in various band composites the Yamuna appears as a dark feature and algal blooms are not evident in most stretches, except just upstream of the Okhla Barrage, where multiple algal mats, of limited spatial extent adhere to the few mid-channel bars present therein. There are also notable coloniesof water hyacinths in this stretch of the Yamuna (Kumar et al. 2019). Such algal blooms arise due to the mixture of sewage and industrial effluents in the channel and the most common types seen are Chlorophyceae and Myxophyceae (Indian Institutes of Technology 2012). To flush out and avoid such algal growth in still waters, flow velocities need to be higher than 0.75 m/s (Chow 1973 in Chahar et al. 2007), whereas the mean lean season flow rate in this segment of the river is only 0.4 m/s (Soni et al. 2014). The total non-monsoonal (October to June) flow in the Delhi stretch of the Yamuna is estimated to be 0.44 TMCM, which is just 16% of its virgin non-monsoon flow of 2.8 TMCM (Jha et al. 1988; CPCB 2006), dropping even further to 0.3 TMCM when greater abstraction occurs at the Wazirabad Barrage (Babu et al. 2003). Since a discharge of 1.8 TMCM is considered necessary for the Yamuna to flush out the various channel contaminants and prevent algal growth (Soni et al. 2014) and ambient conditions are far below this, pollution levels remain high throughout the non-monsoon period (Agarwal and Krause 2013; Rajankar et al. 2014). Older studies have shown that the dilution of contaminants does not take place during the flow process due to the low discharge conditions (for dilution a minimum flow of 0.6 TMCM is required per month and a total nonmonsoonal flow of 5 TMCM, whereas these values for the Yamuna at Delhi are far lower-Soni et al. 2014) and thus almost no betterment was recorded during the 30 hours that it takes for any discharge to travel from the Najafgarh Drain outlet into the channel near the Wazirabad Barrage up to Okhla (Central Board for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution 1983). Pollution mass balance simulation studies conducted by Sharma et al. (2017) and Sharma and Singh (2009) have also surmised that significant contaminant dilution does not occur within the Yamuna's stretch at Delhi due to the Barrageregulated flow conditions and unabated domestic sewage inflows.Absolute estimates of the reach-wise sediment concentration were obtained from the SPM and Turbidity outputs(Figure 6), which represent conditions in the first week after the lockdown began and towards the end of the third lockdown (4-17 May) phase. We mapped these for the extent between the stretch. The 29.03.2020 output reveals, as expected, greater suspended sediments in the upstream section, from the Wazirabad Barrage to Kudesia Ghat, within which most drains debouch(Figure 6a). SPM values range from 50-60 mg/L in this reach to 10-20 mg/L just upstream of the Okhla Barrage, where sediments settle down in stagnant water. The scenario changes markedly in the 16.05.2020 output, with SPM reductions throughout the entire stretch examined. While the greatest concentrations are still seen in the Wazirabad-Kudesia reach, values reduce to 30-40 mg/L. Downstream of Nizamuddin Bridge, the SPM is less than 10 mg/L for the entire remaining stretch. For the lower reaches, a 60-70% reduction in the SPM load occurred between the 29.03.2020 and 16.05.2020 outputs, with this being 30-40% for the uppermost segments (Figure S6a).Since no SPM/TSS measurements are taken directly on the Yamuna (nor any turbidity measures), direct validation of our derived results were not possible. Perforce, we have used the only daily TSS data available during the lockdown period-that of the major STPs in Delhi (obtained from the Delhi Jal Board), on the surmise that the TSS of the effluents from their outflow drains is likely to exhibit a similar character to that of a mostly impounded river during its low-flow season. It was expected though that the drain TSS values may be slightly higher than those of the main channel, due to their moreconstrained flow conditions but would not deviate too far. For 29.03.2020, we averaged the available real-time TSS observations of the Rithila, Coronation Pillar (Phase-II) and Nilothi STP outflows (all part of the Najafgarh Drain network), with this value being 41.99 mg/L (minimum: 18.23 mg/L and maximum: 54.74 mg/L). The only other such data available was for the Yamuna Vihar STP (Phase-III), located opposite to the Najafgarh Drain complex on the other flank of the Yamuna and this value was 35 mg/L. Comparisons of the image-extracted SPM values for the reaches situated beside and just SPM outputs, the two Turbidity measures obtained show similar reductions across the board. The Nechad_2009_2016 output (Figure 6b) has turbidity levels dropping from 60-70 FNU to 30-40 FNU in the upper reaches while this change in the lower segments goes from 30-40 FNU to 0-10 FNU. The reach-wise change rates for this parameter (",

This could only be done for one dataset (image date-29.03.2020 and sampling date-06.04.2020) for which all the parameters analysed were available and the image and sampling dates were close to each other. Correlations have also been derived between just the image-extracted parameters for all channel segments of the Wazirabad-Okhla stretch and from both sets of data (minus the SPM-Turbidity measures) for all sampled stations/reaches, considering the 2019 and 2020 values together (Tables S10 and S11, respectively). While the correlations between parameters are not always strong (since we were in effect comparing point-derived values of measured water sample parameters with reach-averaged values of the image-derived parameters), some generalised observations could be elicited. Turbidity indices and measures are negatively related with BOD levels. Higher turbidity levels can act as light inhibitors(Wang 1974) and this shadowing effect may result in impaired algal growth, thereby lowering BOD levels. As measures of water surface plant matter content, the NDVI and FAI are positively related with the BOD and COD and thus, negatively so before flowing into the river(CPCB 2004). Plans formulated towards better STP positioning/functioning with interceptor-sewers (Yamuna River Project 2016) and efficient solid waste management practices within the city (e.g. Zhao and Song 2017) can markedly reduce domestic and industrial effluent loads entering the channel. Successful completion and sustained monitoring of targeted rejuvenation plans for the major polluting drains like the Najafgarh (Alday and Vir Gupta 2017) and Palam outlets (Holland 2017) and prior waste management in their catchment zones, would also help substantially in achieving this. Optimizing agricultural practices in the area's limited rural tracts and increased used of organic fertilizers instead of chemical ones can also reduce harmful contaminant loads. Enabling periodic high discharges from the Wazirabad Barrage can help flush out the dirt in this channel segment. In this aspect, reconnecting the Yamuna with its floodplain and using the ambient micro-topography and vegetation to manage wastes (Shen 2017) is critical. An overall improvement in the condition of the stream's adjacent riparian tracts is also required (like rejuvenating the Okhla Bird Sanctuary area-Adak 2017b; Dixit 2019; Bhatia and Vats 2019), with suitable floodplain zonation and wetland regeneration, which are crucial towards maintaining river health (Babu et al. 2013). The use of vegetative buffers along the river can help mitigate seasonal floods, absorb contaminants and enable better hyporheic exchanges (Mondal and Patel 2018), all factors in enhancing environmental flows and having a healthier aquatic ecosystem (NIH 2011), with the presently allocated eflow amounts being lower than what is suitable (Soni et al. 2014). Urban greening and better land use management practices within the river corridor (cf. Banerji and Patel 2019) can not only check water logging but also reduce sediment loads washed into the Yamuna, as has already been attempted in Noida (Matto and Jainer 2018), on the left flank of the Yamuna alongside Delhi-plans that can feasibly be extended throughout the river's Delhi NCT stretch on either bank.Making the Yamuna more visible in the city's psyche, by highlighting its heritage and role in Delhi's development (e.g. Brookover 2015) can also garner public support for riverfront cleaning drives and channel quality restoration. The spate of newspaper articles, blogs and tweets about its cleanlier status during this lockdown must be used to press on for coordinated efforts to truly improve and sustain its water and riparian quality, critically reexamining current waste management and floodplain . Such contestations of the Yamuna's floodplain (Follmann 2016) must be resolved through plans that integrate the urban ecology and channel quality (e.g. Babu and Seth 2007; Alday and Vir Gupta 2018) and generate spaces and facilities that allow both humans and nature to breathe.",
