High tidal volumes were associated with prolonged intubation ([48 h) (1.5 vs. CONCLUSION. Traditional and very high tidal volumes are associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and organ dysfunction after cardiac surgery and use of high tidal volumes is an independent risk factor. ''Prophylactic'' protective ventilatory strategy should be provided in this population with inflammatory state at risk to develop ventilator induced pulmonary edema. Women and patients with high BMI are more at risk to be ventilated with injurious tidal volumes. INTRODUCTION. Evidence shows that clinicians' non-technical skills (behavioural and cognitive skills) have a significant impact on teamworking, patient safety, efficiency of care provided and potentially patient outcomes (1) . Such skills are key for Cardiac Arrest Teams (CATs), which are multi-professional (Anaesthetists, Physicians and Nurses) and normally function under high pressure. To date, most tools to assess nontechnical skills in healthcare have focused on surgery (2) and anaesthesia (3) . No validated, robust tools are currently available for assessing non-technical skills in CATs.",

INTRODUCTION. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) involves loss of spontaneous breathing and mandates airway control. Steps to reduce adverse incidents include adherence to minimum monitoring standards, appropriate drug selection, access to difficult airway equipment and presence of skilled anaesthetists. There is substantial evidence that appropriate monitoring reduces risk by detecting the consequences of errors, and by giving early warning of patient deterioration. OBJECTIVES.

Reason for anaesthesia, location, drugs administered, monitoring modalities, adverse events and access to airway equipment were recorded. RESULTS. Data from 26 patient episodes were collected: predominantly in the emergency department (38%) and intensive care unit (27%) for respiratory failure (46%), reduced consciousness (19%) and to facilitate investigations (19%) . The most common induction agent was propofol (52%); thiopentone (26%) and etomidate (11%) were less frequently used. Suxamethonium (73%) was preferred for initial neuromuscular blockade. During induction most doctors used pulse oximetry, electrocardiography and blood pressure monitoring. Only 24% used capnography. No doctor used minimum monitoring to Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) standards. 1 Rescue airway equipment immediately available is shown in Fig. 1 . Complications occurred in 12 cases (Fig. 2) . Patients that had a hypotensive episode during induction all had thiopentone or propofol used as induction agents. 15% of patients had a period of desaturation, and 23% required more than one attempt for successful intubation. In cases with complications, rescue airway equipment was unavailable in[60 and 75% did not achieve UK minimum monitoring standards. CONCLUSIONS. Shortcomings during emergency anaesthesia were recorded including monitoring, access to rescue airways and physiological disturbance. Procedural guidelines and training are to be developed for emergency anaesthesia; access to capnography and alternative airway equipment will be assured. These issues are unlikely to be unique to our Trust and assessment of practice is recommended. INTRODUCTION. Critical care echocardiography (CCE) is performed and interpreted by the intensivist at the bedside to establish diagnoses and guide the management of patients with circulatory or respiratory failure in the ICU. Competence in basic and advanced CCE has been recently defined [1] , but no curriculum to reach the required cognitive and technical skills has yet been elaborated. OBJECTIVES. To assess the efficacy of a limited, tailored training program for noncardiologist residents without experience in ultrasound to reach competence in basic CCE. METHODS. Six noncardiologist residents (Anaesthesiology: n = 5, Pneumology: n = 1) without previous experience in ultrasound participated to the study during two 3-month periods. The curriculum consisted in 4 h of didactics, 2 h of interactive clinical cases and 6 h of tutored hands-on. Color Doppler mapping was excluded from the training. After completion of the training program, all eligible patients underwent subsequently a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed in random order by a recently trained resident and an experienced intensivist with expertise in CCE who was used as a reference. In each patient, the resident and the experienced intensivist answered binary ''rule in, rule out'' clinical questions covered by basic CCE [1] : global left ventricular (LV) size and systolic function (eye-ball evaluation of ejection fraction), homogeneous or heterogeneous LV contraction pattern, global right ventricular (RV) size and systolic function, identification of pericardial fluid and tamponade, and assessment of both the size and respiratory variations of the IVC. In case of undetermined interpretation, the corresponding clinical question was considered not addressed. The agreement between responses to clinical questions provided by the two investigators who independently interpreted the TTE study at bedside was used as an indicator of effectiveness of the tested curriculum. proportion of graduates to work within a ''Critical Care'' setting. The level of support available to trainees may vary with local resources but risk management and national guidelines stipulate that close supervision is provided to junior doctors in high stake decisions and procedures until deemed competent at the relevant tasks 1 . Furthermore, substantial ongoing reduction in working hours places further limitations on training; both majors can impact adversely on junior doctors service output and experience. A modified Delphi method was used 2 years ago to design a task focused single-day course on the theoretical basis of critical care and provide lab-based training in Delphi identified high risk procedures and interventions 2 .",

The use of filling pressures of the right atrium and left atrium is normal in the monitoring of critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. This monitoring is done through an invasive catheter placed in the superior vena cava and pulmonary artery, which is not free of complications. The ability to make measurements of these parameters in a non invasive way, makes the echocardiography an useful and essential tool when monitoring critically ill patients OBJECTIVES. We focus the study on validate the reliability of noninvasive measurements by echocardiography and invasive measurement catheters of filling pressures METHODS. We conducted a prospective observational study relating the filling pressures, between central venous pressure (CVP) with the diameter of the inferior vena cava and left atrial pressures with the values of the ratio E/e 0 . The filling pressure variables were only discriminated as high or low. Low values were accepted when invasive measurement of CVP was \\6 and \\4 mmHg in the LAP; and by echocardiography when the diameter of the IVC was\\12 mm and the ratio E/e 0 \\8. High values were accepted when the measurement of CVP was higher than 10 and 8 mmHg in LAP and in echocardiography when the diameter of the IVC [16 mm and the ratio E/e 0 [15. We collected data from 38 patients in the immediate postoperative period, under mechanical ventilation (Vt 8-9 ml/kg, FiO 2 50%, PEEP 3), sinus rhythm, good cardiac function and without postoperative drug support. All of them had a central venous line and right atrium catheter as habitual monitoring of postoperative cardiac patients. We performed an echocardiography when the patient presented hypotension, with low values of CVP and LAP, and we repeated the measurements after the infusion of the habitual fluid protocol (500 ml HES 6% in 30-45 min). The data we record were: diameter of IVC and ratio E/e 0 by echo and CVP and LAP values by invasive catheters. 23rd ESICM Annual Congress -Barcelona, Spain -9-13 October 2010 S333 INTRODUCTION.

When available, ROC curves were also generated for pulse pressure variation (PPV) and central venous pressure (CVP). , volumes (GEDVI) and variabilities (SVV, PPV) have been suggested to predict volume responsiveness (VR). The final classification of a patient as ''volume responsive'' is usually made by a volume challenge (VC) with an infusion of a pre-defined amount of fluid over a certain time. Among many variations of VCs, the infusion of 7 ml crystalloid over 30 min is one of the most established. Despite superior predictive capabilities of SVV, PPV and GEDI compared to CVP and PAWP in a number of studies, they fail to predict VR in a substantial number of patients. Furthermore, the use of these parameters is limited due to femoral access of the CVC (GEDI; CVP) or the absence of controlled ventilation and/or sinus rhythm (SVV, PPV).

INTRODUCTION. The prevalence of obesity, defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) C30 kg/ m 2 , reaches epidemic proportions. It is not only a risk factor for health problems, but also exacerbates illness progression. Consequently, the number of obese patients on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has increased enormously. Caring for obese patients can be quite challenging due to the weight and size of this person. The extent of and specific problems associated to the care of obese ICU patients are unknown. The aim of this study is to identify and quantify problems nurses face in caring for obese patients on the ICU.",

Surprisingly, the intensity of the problems was similar in both groups. Most of the problems were moderate (hardly to solve by one person) or severe (only to solve with two persons or special equipment). Moderate problems occurred in 32.3% of normal weight patients and in 33.3% of obese patients; severe problems 29.0 and 31.9%, respectively. This result was also confirmed by the survey. The nurses qualified most of the problems they were asked about as moderate or severe, and the frequency of the experienced problems was much higher.

METHODS. Teams of three delirium experts visited ten ICU's in the The Netherlands in which the CAM-ICU was incorporated in daily practice, twice. These teams consisted of two consultants in either psychiatry, clinical geriatrics or neurology, and either a research-physician (MMJvE) or a research-nurse (MvdB). Based on cognitive testing, inspection of the files and DSM-IV criteria for delirium, the teams classified patients as awake and not delirious, or delirious or comatose. This classification served as gold standard to which the CAM-ICU as performed by the bed-side nurses was compared. A simple 2 9 2 table was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS. 15 delirium experts performed 333 assessments. 181 (54%) of these patients were assessable for delirium, 126 (38%) patients were excluded because the level of consciousness was too low, and 27 (8%) patients were non-assessable due to other reasons. Overall, we found a sensitivity of 47% (95% CI 35-58%) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI 92-99%). The strengths of this study include the large numbers, the multicentre design, the extensive evaluations by teams of various delirium experts and the independent assessments of delirium experts and bed-side nurses. A limitations is the time interval between the expert assessment and the administration of the CAM-ICU (mean 125 min; standard deviation 118 min). There were striking differences in implementation strategies of the CAM-ICU between the centres. Tables 1, 2 . 23rd ESICM Annual Congress -Barcelona, Spain -9-13 October 2010 S341",

Subsequently, selected breaths were blindly analyzed by 2 trained nurses and 3 intensivists to identify ineffective expiratory efforts. INTRODUCTION. Several publications indicate that manual hyperinflation is a widely used measure in the ICU, but more important is the fact that there is no uniformity in the implementation of this measure. This is also on my ward. In literature there are a number of reasons given to start manual hyperinflation: abolish mucus retension, improve oxygenation and removal of atelectasis. The positive effects are improved compliance, improved oxygenation and a decrease in the number of VAP's (Ventilator Associated Pneumonia). The negative effects are a decrease in cardiac output due to high peak pressures, an increased risk of baro-/volutrauma and the risk of giving too much tidal volumes. The risk of barotrauma increase with pressures above 40 cmH 2 O. Other side effects include the development of a pneumothorax and increased ICP (intra cranial pressure).",

CONCLUSIONS. Compliance with BTS Guidelines could be improved. Unsurprisingly co-morbidities were frequent, but did not seem to affect outcome. Use of a pneumonia severity assessment tool was sub-optimal, however mean CURB-65 score didn't correlate with that recommended to prompt critical care assessment. Apart from functional status, we are unable currently to identify any factors in this age group which can be used to guide critical care admission decision making. CONCLUSIONS. In our study the incidence of complicated pneumonia was 316/10,000 patients admitted in PICU. In necrotizing pneumonias the blood cultures were more positive than in non-necrotizing patients. Although the surgical approach in necrotizing pneumonia is controversial, it resulted in a insignificantly lower mortality rate, comparing with non-necrotizing pneumonias. BACKGROUND.

The rate of extubation was 22%. 78% screens did not lead to liberation from mechanical ventilation. The extubation rate does not correspond with the findings of the ABC trial with an extubation rate of 54%. Table 1 shows the physicians' reasons to continuing mechanical ventilation. It should be noted that all patients with an unsafe airway were patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of B 8 [intracerebral haemorrhage (68%), cerebral infections (13%), post-CPR encephalopathy (13%) and severe brain injury (6%)]. We accomplished a reduction in the use of sedatives (-12% midazolam and -35% propofol) and morphine (-27%) ( Table 1 ). The amount of time spend on ventilators decreased, albeit not significantly (p = 0.902). This was probably due to the VAP-ventilatorbundle (introduced last year), the heterogeneity of our cohort and the already short MV-duration. . Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been utilized in selected patients with hypoxemic ARF to avert endotracheal intubation, which is related to life-threatening complications. NIV has been also proposed to facilitate weaning and extubation in patients with hypercapnic ARF. So far, no controlled randomized study has investigated the potential role of NIV in weaning patients with hypoxemic ARF. OBJECTIVES. We designed this pilot study to assess safety and feasibility of NIV to wean hypoxemic ARF patients. Twenty mechanically ventilated patients with hypoxemic ARF were randomized to receive early extubation followed by NIV application via helmet (Helmet group) or conventional weaning through the endotracheal tube (Tube group). Primary outcomes were the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and the adherence to the study protocol. Secondary outcomes were protocol failure (i.e. need for re-intubation), ICU and hospital mortality, rate of tracheotomy, duration of continuous intravenous sedation, weaning time, and septic complications. Table 1 . Weaning through helmet by NIV application following early extubation was safe and feasible. Overall the adherence to the study design was 90%. In addition, in the helmet group, there was a significant reduction in the rate of tracheotomy and a trend toward a lower rate of protocol failure, and fewer days on invasive ventilation. There was no difference with respect to days of continuous sedation, ICU and hospital mortality, weaning time and septic complications. (1) . Delirium is a common occurence on the ICU and is associated with increased length of stay (LOS) and poor outcomes (2) . OBJECTIVES. We developed a combined daily sedation hold, delirium management, and weaning (SDW) protocol and implemented this to reduce ICU LOS and improve outcomes. METHODS. A SDW protocol was implemented in 2009. We prospectively audited all patients from January to March 2010. Delirium was measured using the ICDSC. Data was analysed using Graphpad statistical software. RESULTS. 109 consecutive patients were analysed. The incidence of delirium was 35% (38 pts). Of these, 63% (24) had risk factors for delirium. There was no difference in onset of delirium between sexes, age, type of admission, or severity of illness. However, in patients with delirium, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and ICU LOS were significantly longer and there was a trend towards increased hospital LOS ( CONCLUSIONS. Measuring the linear dependence of variables through time by K 2 and \u00f8 may be used to determine non-linear behavior between the variables of the EMMV. Non-linear behavior during weaning perhaps indicates the dependency of, either the resistance or compliance of the respiratory system, on the ventilatory support (i.e. Pi). Accordingly, K 2 and \u00f8, estimated at the frequency interval form 6 to 1 (h) -1 , can provide information concerning to the dynamics of the respiratory system that can be used as a complement to determine the suitability of the MV withdrawal.

The result was 1,000 breaths covering most of the shapes the expiratory curve could have. Five expert attendant physicians independently analyzed the 1,000 selected breaths and classified them as EA or not. The EA algorithm processed the same 1,000 selected breaths and assigned a percentage to each one, according to the variation in the shape and direction of the expiratory airflow and airway pressure curves.

INTRODUCTION. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with a vascular occlusion test (VOT) has been proposed to assess and identify metabolic and microcirculatory alterations during sepsis and shock in critically ill patients. However, to automatize repeated measurements at the bedside, this technique can potentially cause discomfort to the patient. Vascular arterial occlusion performed in the finger may be a more attractive method to execute repeated measurements at the bedside because of more tolerability from the patient.

It was concluded that differences in HMGB1 values in the early stage after the onset of ALI (not ARDS)/ARDS are useful as outcome determining factors after 30 days of onset.

ICUs skillful in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), as recently shown [1] , may improve survival of these patients. Since 1989 we developed a treatment algorithm for AHRF which encomprises: (1) low flow venous-venous ECMO (LF-ECMO) consisting in a relatively low initial blood flow (BF, 2-2.5 L/min) to maximize extracorporeal CO 2 removal while providing partial oxygenation (if needed, BF can be increased up to 4.5-5 l/min to keep arterial pO2 above 45 mmHg); (2) femoral-femoral percutaneous cannulation with 21-25 Fr cannulas to allow free movements of the neck and increase patient's tolerance; (3) early institution of spontaneous assisted ventilation (SB) and weaning from sedation and mechanical ventilation (MV) while on ECMO.",

Ventilating patients with acute lung injury (ALI) in supine position potentially leads to an impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Prone position (PP) is an attractive means to improve ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) ratio [1, 2] but has several contraindications and showed no improvement in survival so far [3] . Another therapeutical option is an upright position, which is easy to perform and has theoretical advantages over PP: the upward shift of the abdominal compartment is less pronounced, thus increasing thoracoabdominal compliance [2] . 4 However, to date regimes of an upright position did not tilt patients more than 45\u00b0 [4] . 4 OBJECTIVES. We hypothesised that a 60\u00b0standing position (SP) during mechanical ventilation may improve respiratory function.

Therefore a centrally cannulated veno-arterial ECLS (Maquet Permanent Life Support) was implanted as a bridge to transplant. Four days later she was extubated while on full ECLS support, in order to reduce the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia. While on ECLS, the patient was mobilized, practiced with an ergometer and chatted with her family. Three days later the patient underwent cardiac transplantation.

            "text": "DISCUSSION. ECLS provides a valuable means as bridge to transplantation, bridge to bridge or bridge to recovery. With the increasing use of ECLS for circulatory failure, debate about the necessity of mechanical ventilation during this treatment ensues. ECLS is usually applied under deep sedation and controlled mechanical ventilation. Discontinuation of sedation possibly prevents intensive care acquired weakness. Extubation during ECLS may provide better pulmonary perfusion due to negative intra-thoracic pressure. Furthermore, the awake and extubated patient is able to mobilize and exercise which may reduce the risk of atelectasis and ventilator associated pneumonia. Our patient however developed pulmonary edema and atelectasis after discontinuation of ECLS. The edema was probably a consequence of reperfusion injury, due to severely decreased pulmonary flow while on ECLS. An absent ventilatory drive while on ECLS may have led to hypoventilation while the patient was extubated, resulting in atelectasis. An extensive Medline search resulted in one other case report describing an extubated patient on ECLS. 1 Intermittent non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was used to prevent atelectasis, but the patient developed pneumonia after 30 days of ECLS. Our patient was successfully extubated while on ECLS. However, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend or oppose extubation of patients on ECLS for circulatory failure. Severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia were defined with a PaO2/ fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of B100, or uncompensated hypercapnea with a pH of \\7.20 despite receiving optimal conventional treatment. The ECMO can be used as a rescue treatment in these case.",

Two groups were defined: bacterial pneumonia with ARDS (BP group, n = 5), and H1N1 influenza with ARDS (H1N1 group, n = 5). All ECMOs were implanted at the bedside to facilitate intra-hospital or inter-hospital transfer, because of severe hypoxemia or hemodynamic instability making impossible patient mobilization before ECMO. RESULTS. Data sets of 44 patients of 47 consecutive patients treated with ECMO were complete and included into analyses. We had no clinical or radiological evidence for thrombosis or clotting within ECMO-circuit with a target-PTT of 35 s. One patient with systemic aspergillosis died because of intracranial hemorrhage. One ECMO circuit had to be replaced due to insufficient oxygenator function after 10 days. Further data are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . CONCLUSIONS. In this retrospective analysis of 44 patients who underwent ECMOtreatment, AC with low-dose heparin (target-PTT of 35 s) was safe and without any observation of macroscopic thrombosis or clotting within the circuit. Transfusion requirements and intracranial hemorrhage were low as compared with previous reports [1, 2] .

The first part of the study used isolated guinea-pig hearts which were perfused in the Langendorff mode at constant flow with oxygenated Tyrode solution at 37\u00b0C. The coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) was continuously monitored throughout the experiment, and intrinsic heart rate (HR) and isovolumetric left ventricular contraction were measured with a thin saline-filled balloon inserted into the left ventricle. The second part of the study was to measure action potentials and ionic currents in ventricular myocytes isolated enzymatically from guinea-pig hearts. Comparison of data was conducted by repeated-measure ANOVA with post hoc test (Bonferroni's correction). CONCLUSIONS. Esmolol had a more potent negative inotropic effect than landiolol. This effect is, at least in part, derived from shortening of APD. In addition, increase of the coronary resistance would facilitate the negative chronotropic action of esmolol in vivo. CONCLUSIONS. NMA moderates HPV in the conscious spontaneously breathing beagle, but not to the same degree as ACZ. As compared to ACZ, the additional methyl-group in NMA may impair its capability in vivo to act on a non-CA ACZ-sensitive cellular receptor or channel or that both, CA-dependent and CA-independent actions of ACZ yield a greater effect.

INTRODUCTION. The importance of early antibiotic therapy has been recently demonstrated. Regarding a rapidly increasing number of obese patients, appropriate drug dosage in these patients is an important challenge of critical care since it has been shown that not only early start of antibiotics but also correct target concentrations decrease mortality. Vancomycin is administered according to body weight (BW). Nevertheless, little is known about the percentage of obese patients achieving pre-defined target serum levels within 24 h after initiation of vancomycin therapy compared to patients with normal BW.",

However, there is a lack of definitive evidence linking concentrations to either outcome or toxicity [2] . Few reports exist comparing intermittent dosing and continuous infusion. Ingram [3] suggested that whilst associated with a slower deterioration in renal function, there was no difference in the prevalence of nephrotoxicity. Similarly, Hutschala [4] demonstrated worsening creatinine in 149 patients following cardiac surgery with both intermittent and continuous infusion but infusion tended to be less nephrotoxic despite receiving higher doses. We wish also to report our experiences with vancomycin infusion in critically ill cardiac patients. METHODS. We examined retrospective data from 2,512 patients treated with vancomycin.

The primary analysis was conducted on clinically meaningful patient oriented outcomes, which included mortality, functional status and quality of life. Secondary analyses considered vomiting/regurgitation, pneumonia, bacteremia, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Meta-analysis was conducted using the Peto analytic method, which is known to minimize bias in the presence of sparse events. The impact of heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 metric. RESULTS. 4,217 unique abstracts were identified, resulting in the retrieval of 701 papers for detailed eligibility review. Four RCTs were identified to be on topic however one RCT reported excessive loss to follow-up such that an intention to treat analysis could not be conducted.

Correlation between the IBP and IGP was significant however moderate (R2 = 0.51). Analysis according to Bland and Altman showed a bias and precision of 0.8 and 2.7 mmHg respectively, however the limits of agreement (LA) were large and ranged from -4.5 to 6.1 mmHg. The median GRV proto was 80 mL (0-1,050) and median GRV classic was also 80 mL (0-1,250). Correlation between the 2 methods was excellent (R2 = 0.89). Analysis according to Bland and Altman showed a bias and precision of -0.8 and 52.3 mL respectively and the limits of agreement (LA) ranged from -103 to 102 mmHg.

A preliminary cost effectiveness analysis shows that the price of measuring GRV with the classic method ranges from 3.84\u20ac to 24.18\u20ac per day, depending on the GRV size. Price of measuring GRV with the gastro PV system is independent of GRV size and is estimated at 9.49\u20ac per day.

In addition, anti-A and anti-B titres of IgM-and IgG-type were investigated. Finally, complement activation products, as well as key components of the complement system, were measured. RESULTS. In Uniplas \u00d2 batches, all coagulation factor activities were higher than 0.7 IU/ml and all protease inhibitor activities, including protein S and plasmin inhibitor, were higher than 0.5 IU/ml. Uniplas \u00d2 contained standardised levels of ADAMTS13 and factor H, within the normal ranges for single-donor freshfrozen plasma.

PRIS is a difficult condition to diagnose and routine monitoring of the adverse effects of high-dose propofol remains sub-optimal.

Through the ROC curves (sensitivity/specificity), with the area under the curve of 82.5% (SE = 11.2%) and with a confidence interval of 95% (p significance of 0.002), resulted in a 12% variations of IVC with a sensibility of 100% and specificity of 42% (Younden's index of 42.9%). The same calculation, based on Kraemer's quality indices (QI) gave us a 13% of variation in IVC, with a w = 0.2 specificity rather than sensitivity (QI 0.58), and with a w = 0.8 sensitivity rather than specificity (QI 0.61) OBJECTIVES.

Citrate CRRT was performed using commercially available equipment and fluid solutions (Multifiltrate \u00d2 with integrated Ci-Ca \u00d2 -system; Fresenius Medical Care; Germany). To maintain stable metabolic and haemodynamic conditions we used an internal standard protocol for citrate CRRT. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive methods (mean, median and standard deviation) and a Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate. P \\ 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS. Although minor metabolic imbalances were observed, none led to a termination of citrate CRRT and all of them could be managed by adjustments of blood flow and dialysate rates according to a preset protocol. Our findings suggest citrate CRRT to be a safe and effective strategy for CRRT even in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Nevertheless, metabolic parameters need to be monitored regularly to avoid severe metabolic derangements. INTRODUCTION.

Systemic heparinisation was the sole anticoagulant used, but compliance with local protocols was poor with 48% of APPTs below the therapeutic range and 46% of infusions commenced at the wrong rate. 68% of filter changes were due to clotting and mean filter life was 32 h. Despite this, dose delivery was acceptable, with 84% of prescribed dose delivered. CONCLUSIONS. As previously reported 1 , our demographic data confirm the relatively poor outcome of patients needing CRRT. We have identified areas where care for these patients could be optimised and endeavour to do this locally via improved protocol design and an ongoing educational programme. Many of the components of CRRT could be incorporated into care bundles, but certain aspects of treatment remain controversial 3 which may be a barrier to their adoption.

Factors known to portend poor prognosis in acutely ill cirrhotics in ICU include the need for mechanical ventilation, development of shock, renal failure and sequential increase in the number of failing organs. While serum lactate is now an established marker of survival and/or the need for transplantation in fulminant liver failure, its impact on critically ill cirrhotics is less well known. METHODS. We retrospectively studied 133 consecutive acutely ill cirrhotics admitted to the ICU between 2005 and 08 at the Royal Free Hospital, a tertiary referral centre in liver diseases and transplantation. Data were collected on demographic variables, aetiology of liver disease, liverspecific prognostic scores [Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), United Kingdom model for end-stage liver disease (UKELD)], and acute illness scores [acute physiological score and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II), sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) ]. In addition, serum lactate levels at 0, 24 and 48 h were also recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and the discrimination ability of each of the above-mentioned scoring models in predicting ICU and hospital survival of these patients was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

The purpose of this analysis is to compare the different regulations approaches in emergency research in North America (Canada, USA) and in Europe (European Directive, France). CONCLUSIONS. This analysis emphasizes the lack of international standardization of regulatory measures and ethical decisions. However some countries like the US seem to advance in the democratic process by mandating additional regulatory measures (community consultation, public disclosure to the communities) prior to initiation of clinical investigation; nonetheless, there is little evidence of their effectiveness. Many challenges are raised. Firstly, the variability in regulations, and consequently in local board's assessments, is problematic, pleading for international regulations. Secondly, the current heterogeneous ethical review process and demanding unsubstantiated regulatory measures poses a risk to all when it is not evidence based and it is applied inconsistently between countries, within a country and worse at the level of each individual hospital review board. It puts the investigator at risk for unnecessary criticism and the community at risk as it is unknown if we truly consult or inform our target communities about waiver of consent research through our current ethical and regulatory processes. Globalization and evaluation of the ethical and regulatory processes are urgently needed; regulatory community has to work towards a standardized evidence-based process upon which to base regulatory decisions.

On the other hand it is inevitable to define what useless medical treatment exactly is and to introduce this category in medical ethics and also in jurisdiction practise. OBJECTIVES.

RESULTS. 10 subjects were recruited. No adverse events occurred during interventions. Significant increases from baseline RR (p \\ 0.0001), V E (p \\ 0.0001) and VO 2 (p = 0.009) occurred during the tilt table intervention. There was an increase in FRC during tilting of 0.6 L which failed to reach significance. Significant increases from baseline RR (p \\ 0.0001), VO 2 (p = 0.024) and a decrease in V T (p = 0.015) occurred with the chair intervention. CONCLUSIONS. These interventions are safe in a critical care population. Increased muscular activity associated with upright interventions elicited expected elevations in VO 2. The tilt-table produced an increase in V E driven by an increased RR at the expense of V T . V E was not elevated during chair sitting despite an increased VO 2 and was accompanied by an unexpected decrease in V T. INTRODUCTION. UK guidelines about rehabilitation after critical illness highlight the need for outcome measures to determine patient progress and efficacy of treatment [1] . There is no consensus about the most appropriate measures of patient function. The AusTOMs [2] tool was designed by therapists in Australia to measure activity and function across nine scales assessing structural and functional difficulties and ability to perform activities. Scales are split into four domains (impairment, activity limitation, participation restriction and distress/wellbeing) and scored from 0 to 5 with 0.5 intervals allowed. Acceptable inter-rater variation is defined as an absolute difference of 0.5. AusTOMs has not been appraised in patients recovering from critical illness. OBJECTIVES. To prospectively determine the inter-rater reliability of the AusTOMs physiotherapy scales in adult patients who had undergone cardiothoracic surgery and required critical care admission for over 5 days. METHODS. The therapy (physiotherapy and occupational therapy) team underwent a 1 h teaching session using the AusTOMs handbook prior to commencing the trial. AusTOMs was then used over eight consecutive weeks during the weekly therapy goal setting meeting. Each week a patient was selected to be scored using the most appropriate functional scales. The clinical history was presented to the team by the therapist leading the patient's care. Therapists were then asked to independently score patients across the four domains for each scale. Reasons underlying differences in scores were explored by group discussion. The difference between the 10th and 90th centiles of the initial scores was calculated for each domain as a measure of inter-rater variability. RESULTS. 6-8 therapists were present at each meeting. Respiratory function and musculoskeletal movement related function were the most common scales used. The mean difference between 10th and 90th centiles was greater than 0.35 (\u00b1 0.21) for all domains.",

INTRODUCTION. ICU delirium represents a form of brain dysfunction that in many cohorts has been diagnosed in 60-85% of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Delirium is a common but complex clinical syndrome characterized by disturbed consciousness, cognitive function or perception, which has an acute onset and fluctuating course and is associated with poor outcomes. And yet, it can be diagnosed and treated. In the UK, reporting of delirium is generally considered to be poor. In light of updated NICE guidelines on delirium due out this year, specialist clinical assessment will soon become gold standard as a means of diagnosing and reducing the prevalence of this condition in the ICU setting. NICE recommends that CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method) be used by healthcare professionals who are trained and competent in the diagnosis of delirium. On our 16-bed unit, we are currently implementing CAM-ICU assessments to be performed twice daily (at the commencement of each nursing shift) as well as RASS (Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale) scoring on an hourly basis for all patients. OBJECTIVES. To implement training of all our ICU nursing staff in the use of CAM-ICU and RASS scoring. To periodically validate and reinforce earlier training, so as to improve assessment and reporting of delirium. METHODS. Our 'Delirium Group' comprising both nursing and medical staff, taught CAM-ICU and RASS to 48 staff members using multimedia presentations in small groups and/or individual teaching sessions over 6 weeks. ScoringofCAM-ICU andRASSwassubsequentlyauditedon3occasions post training. Discrepancies were discussed and post-audit retraining provided where necessary. RESULTS. The following audit and validation data were generated on our unit as documented in Table 1 . No statistical analysis was undertaken. We anticipate focusing on the challenges encountered and strategies used in managing this change in our ICU practice. METHODS. The factors causing resistance to change based on multisource data. Qualitative technical methods were used: brainstorming and focal groups. The data collection elaboration was created by the collaboration of ICU Nurse, Quality Department Nurse and external reviewers. Finally, the main factors were classified in different categories. Each category was scored by 1 to 5 according to gravity and prevention possibility. Finally, priority was given to more serious and easier prevention problems. RESULTS. The most serious problems for ICU professional was the historical factors. The easier solution problems were ''the lack of information'' and all evaluators were agree with it. We arranged the factors in order to the next classification (Tables 1 and 2 ). DISCUSSION. All investigators were agreed with the low importance of problems with payments and low prevention probability of low organisational flexibility, so they were agreed on not to work about them. The ICU professionals were more pessimistic and have lower confidence in prevention possibilities but they showed more confidence about the capacity to learn new skills. They weren't worried about resistance to do experimental things. Probably, historic factors play an important role in this pessimistic attitude. On the other side, Quality and Safety Experts have more experience in prevention programs and they put all their trust in its. After doing the analysis, we chose the ''lack of information problem'' to plan prevention activities. We consider it is a serious and real problem but at the same time, easy of prevent. CONCLUSIONS. The implementation of the Patient Safety Program in the ICU means a real cultural change. The priority analysis could help to plan strategies in order to avoid the program failure. OBJECTIVES. We concerned about whether medical personnel could recognize management of the cuff of artificial airway or not.",

CONCLUSIONS. This study found significant discrepancies between clinical diagnoses before death and post-mortem findings. This reinforces the importance of the post-mortem examination in detecting otherwise unexpected diagnoses and improving the quality of care of critically ill patients. INTRODUCTION.

INTRODUCTION. Importance of renal assessing in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is unquestionable for a correct drug dosing, fluid requirements or decisions for renal replacement therapies. Serum creatinine (SC) is a very common biochemical parameter in clinical practice for assessment of renal function. Many equations have been designed to estimate creatinine clearance based on SC, but their capacities for providing a correct estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are suboptimal. This is even worse in critically ill patients due to malnutrition and/or immobilization. In clinical practice, despite its limitations, 24 h-urine creatinine clearance (CrCl 24h ) is used as a reference method to determine GFR. Data show that Cystatin-C could be promising as an endogenous filtration marker in ICU settings.",

RESULTS. All formulae showed notable bias from the reference method.

There are well established and robust techniques for measuring and categorizing renal function in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A number of rapid bedside estimates of renal function have been devised incorporating routine daily measurements, such as serum creatinine, in combination with demographic data (e.g. Cockroft-Gault, the MDRD series). The addition of serum cystatin C measurements to some equations may also improve accuracy of estimation.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key process in tissue development and repair, has also been identified as a major mechanism in fibrogenesis. The cytokine TGFb has been shown to induce transformation of epithelial cells into matrixforming and smooth muscle actin (SMA)-expressing myofibroblast (MF) via EMT. The other prerequisite is an injury-induced loss of intercellular contact, including adherens junctions (AJs). The classical experimental method to induce AJ disruption is the uncoupling of E-cadherin-mediated contacts by Low Calcium Medium (LCM). This concept has been termed as the two-hit model of EMT (1). b-catenin, a scaffold protein of the AJ, released by cell contact injury, can act as a transcription factor and has been shown to facilitate EMT. However, the mechanism whereby cell contact injury promotes EMT is not understood. Our recent studies have shown that Smad3, one of the main signal transducers of the TGFb pathway is a strong inhibitor of epithelial SMA expression, by interfering with myocardinrelated transcription factor (MRTF) [2] . The latter is the main driver of the SMA promoter, through it association with serum response factor (SRF). Intriguingly, b-catenin can bind to Smad3.",

Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), the most abundantly expressed cytochrome P450 enzymes in liver, are responsible for the metabolism of over 50% of drugs used across several therapeutic classes. In adults, CYP3A is represented primarily by the major isoform, CYP3A4, and a polymorphically expressed isoform, CYP3A5. Individuals with at least one wild-type CYP3A5*1 allele synthesise functionally active enzyme while homozygotes for the *3 allele are functional non-expressers of the enzyme. The presence of functional CYP3A5 increases the hepatic metabolism of CYP3A substrates such as tacrolimus. CKD is known to reduce the hepatic metabolism of drugs via the CYP3A enzyme system and we have shown, recently, that AKI has a similar effect and that the length of time with AKI is the most important variable. We hypothesise that expression of functional CYP3A5 may reduce the impact of AKI on hepatic drug metabolism as has been shown to be the case for drug interactions with the imidazole antifungals.",

The non-anaemic group did increase the distance walked significantly from 3 to 6 months. There was no difference between albumin, CRP and creatinine concentrations between the groups. METHODS. This experiment was divided into two procedures. The first procedure is to choose two kinds of cell strains, including Jurkat cell strain (comes from leukemia) and CCRF-CEM cell strain (comes from acute lymphocyte leukemia).we cultivate this two kinds of cell strains to mature stage, then inoculate every kind of cell strain into four culture dishes, two culture dishes was stimulated by 1 lg/ml lipopolysaccharide(study group), and the other two culture dishes serve as blank control(not stimulated by 1 lg/ml lipopolysaccharide). Eight hours later, we extracted the microRNA in each culture dish. The second procedure is to use the technique of gene microarray to analysis the difference expressions of microRNA. In the context of a high altitude expedition human subjects can safely be submitted to prolonged hypoxia and the resulting changes in mitochondrial function can be explored in a controlled fashion. The effect of hypoxia on immune cells-key players in the pathophysiology of sepsis-is of particular interest.",

We measured patient-reported outcome following surgical management with DC using a quality of life instrument. METHODS. Survivors discharged between 3 and 18 months after severe TAT were contacted after obtaining approval by our institutional IRB. We excluded patients with neurotrauma. We applied self-response version EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D) and visual analog scale (EQ-VAS: 0 (worst health)-100 (best health). EuroQoL it is based on a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usualactivities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of response: no problems (level 1), some problems (level 2) severe problems (level 3). RESULTS. Thirty four patients were contacted.

Serum S-100b levels were significantly higher in patients with intracranial lesions than in the remaining patients. The average value of the protein in patients without intracranial lesion was 0.315 lg/L with a CI 95% (0.265-0.365 lg/L), and in those with pathological findings in CT was 0.601 lg/L with a CI 95% (0.403-0.798 lg/L). Significant differences were found between levels of S100b protein and the presence of pathological findings in the CT (p = 0.001) (Fig. 1) . The ROC curve analysis showed that S100b protein is a useful tool to discriminate the presence of intracranial injury in CT (AUC, 0.76, 95% CI, 0.685-0.907, p \\ 0.001). S100B analyses with a cut-off level of 0.105 lg/L showed a sensitivity 100% but a specificity 19.2%.

Determination of serum protein S-100b is a useful biochemical indicator of brain damage in head trauma.

To assess excitability parameters we recorded stimulus-response behaviour, threshold electrotonus, current-threshold relationship and recovery cycle from abductor pollicis brevis muscle following stimulation of the median nerve [3] . Data are shown as median and 25%/75% percentile. CONCLUSIONS. We describe for the first time that critically ill patients in general show muscle-and nerve membrane depolarization, whereas patients later suffering from muscle weakness due to CIM or CIM/CIP feature additionally reduced membrane excitability. This suggests that membrane depolarization in critically ill patients is caused by energy failure leading to dysfunction of the Na-K pump, the motor of membrane repolarisation-whereas reduced membrane excitability in CIM or CIM/CIP needs an additional dysfunction of voltage gated sodium channels for example occurring in the presence of endotoxins [2] .",

Thus, SIRS symptoms may occur after antibacterial treatment even if there is no infection or inflammation. We suggest a more precise method which could help to avoid the excessive antibacterial therapy and to control it in patients with CNS disease-a procalcitonin test.",

Data for both parts of the study was obtained from two electronic databases, WardWatcher and CareVue. CareVue was searched to identify patients with ICUAW and WardWatcher was used to identify the controls. Data collected included: patient and illness characteristics, severity of illness scoring, organ support and treatments provided, laboratory results and outcomes. Minitab software was used for statistical analysis. CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of ICUAW was very low, we hypothesise this to be explained by the absence of systematic evaluation of patients for ICUAW. The risk factors and outcomes for ICUAW were consistent with some of the published literature. Prospective study is now planned to systematically evaluate this condition. With increasing age, comorbidity, and socioeconomic deprivation being associated with higher risk pregnancies, there comes a potential higher risk of complications. Neurological and neurosurgical complications, which can be particularly devastating during the peripartum period, include those due to medical conditions of pregnancy (hypertensive disease, sepsis, thromboembolic disease, hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury), iatrogenic complications secondary to anaesthetic or obstetric interventions, incidental illness or injury (pharmacological alterations, trauma, tumour), and deliberate self-harm and violence.",

Further work is underway to ascertain the true numbers of neurological complications of pregnancy countrywide. Our approach represents a paradigm for the continuing audit of pregnancy-related critical care resource use in Scotland. INTRODUCTION. Hypertonic saline has an osmotic effect on the brain because of its high tonicity and ability to effectively remain outside the blood-brain barrier. There may be a minimal benefit in restoring cerebral blood flow, which is thought to be mitigated through local effects of hypertonic saline on cerebral microvasculature.

For this purpose a protocol of research in two phases has been planned. The first included objective measurements, with the use of suitable equipment, of the natural factors of temperature, humidity, ventilation, lighting and noise. The second phase included the subjective estimation of the working people about their own health and conditions of their work, in the particular area of the Hospital with the use of substantiated anonymous questionnaire. After the subjective and objective study and analysis of 32 questionnaires and 55 measurements of natural factors, we found that the medium temperature of the ICU was 24\u00b0C. The mean relative humidity of the ICU was 38% (highest 38.3% and lowest 37.8%). The mean ventilation rate of the ICU was 17 m 3 /h (highest 28.8 and lowest \\7.2 m 3 /h).

The objective data seem to keep pace with the subjective opinions of the working people, as they were impressed in the questionnaires of subjective estimate. The objective data were compared with the subjective. The results of the research were also compared with data from the existing bibliography and current legislation, leading to a line of conclusions. (1) Insufficient and bad quality ventilation. (2) The existing temperature of the environment contributes to the appearance of Sick Building Syndrome. (3) The working environment is noisy.

The common interests of both professionals, charge nurses and intensivists, should be emphasized when new technology-based systems are developed. BACKGROUND. The nursing shortage is an international problem that is expected to worsen in the coming years. Studies show that one of the main reasons nurses leave the profession is their dissatisfaction with their work environment. Structural empowerment and nurse-physician collaboration are two elements of the nurses' work environment that are potentially related to one another according to Kanter's theory (1977) . In addition, a nurse's clinical specialization has been found to influence perceptions related to these two concepts.",

Whilst the validity of services has been questioned, the data itself indicates that more patients are referred and frequency of interventions has increased. Various system changes occurred during this time period such as a change of Mews trigger scores, the advent of 24 h CCO and courses such as ALERT and Survive Sepsis were introduced into the basic training of staff. It must be noted that the intention in the UK for CCO was a service that empowered staff through education to undertake this care themselves; therefore the increase in interventions could indicate that the educational approach hasn't made progress. Although the study compares 13 interventions, an increase in the type of interventions was also noted such as ward based CCO supervised CPAP and establishing a PICC line service. Therefore this highlights the changing application of interventions. Further analysis is required to look at the appropriate skills required for the delivery of safe care to the acutely ill in the ward environment. Whilst ward staff are increasingly under resourced, both in skills and manpower, CCO do provide the skills, knowledge and time to meet the shortfall in safe timely care. INTRODUCTION. Working as a critical care nurse involves situations where teamwork is essential and rapid, effective communication is of importance [1] . The education to become a specialist ICU nurse gives skills and knowledge to manage patients who are critically ill with rapidly changing conditions [2] .

We recorded the organisational characteristics of participating centres, the patients' baseline characteristics, and the achievement of targets within the resuscitation and management bundles. RESULTS. Sixteen countries and 150 ICUs participated, enrolling 1285 patients. Hospital mortality was 44.9%. Achievement rates for the bundle targets were: lactate measurement, 39.8%; blood cultures, 62.5%; broad-spectrum antibiotics, 64.0%; fluids \u00b1 vasopressors, 81.4%; central venous pressure, 39.7%; central or mixed venous oxygen saturation, 10.8%; low-dose steroids, 55.8%; drotrecogin alfa, 3.2%; glucose control, 27.1%; lung-protective ventilation, 11.7%. Compliance rates for the entire resuscitation and management bundles were 7.6 and 3.5% respectively. On logistic regression analysis, achievement of the targets for blood cultures, antibiotics, and central venous pressure independently predicted decreased mortality. High-income countries, university hospitals, ICUs with an accredited fellowship programme, and surgical ICUs were more likely to be compliant to the resuscitation bundle. CONCLUSIONS. Compliance to the resuscitation and management bundles is generally poor across Asia. Given the resource limitations in Asia, the most appropriate strategy to improve outcomes in severe sepsis may be to concentrate on ensuring early administration of antibiotics after blood cultures, and appropriate fluid therapy.",

To evaluate and compare the circulating DCs number in patients with severe sepsis, septic or cardiogenic shock. METHODS. In a prospective multicentric study (3 ICU), consecutive immunocompetent patients with severe sepsis (SS), septic shock, cardiogenic shock were included. Peripheral blood DC counts, measured by flow cytometry, were evaluated and compared between the three populations at admission and 24 h later. Correlation to disease severity evaluated by clinical scores and day 28 mortality was studied. RESULTS. 100 patients were included (age 61 \u00b1 14 years, 56 male, SOFA D0 10.5 \u00b1 3.9, SAPS II 61 \u00b1 18): 49 septic shock, 16 severe sepsis and 22 cardiogenic shock. Mortality at D28 was respectively 43, 14 and 59%. 13 patients presented a sepsis associated to cardiogenic shock. At baseline and at day 1, a dramatic diminution in the numbers of total DCs either myeloid (MDCs) or plasmacytoid (PDCs), was observed in sepsis (severe sepsis or septic shock) compared to cardiogenic shock patients. No difference was seen between severe sepsis and septic shock patients (Fig. 1). We did not observe any correlation between the number of total DCs at admission or at day 1 and severity of illness scores",

Delayed extubation is associated with prolonged ventilation, muscleweakness and ventilation-associated complications (e.g. VAP). Therefore the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) should be limited as much as possible. Several studies show positive results with their interventions. To decrease the time spend on ventilator we introduced a four interventions wean screen-protocol based on the ABC-trial and Robertson's work: 1. Daily Spontaneous Awakening Trial (SAT) 2. Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (RSBI) 3. Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) 4. Consultation of MD to extubate or reason to continue OBJECTIVES. To reduce the use of sedatives and to decrease the amounts of time spend on a ventilator (MV-duration) through daily assessment by a ventilation practitioner (R.N.) using a four-step-wean screen-protocol. SETTING. A 20-bed mixed medical-(neuro-) surgical level III Intensive Care Unit of a teaching hospital in the The Netherlands. METHODS. In 2009 the sedation goal was prescribed each day by the intensivist; nurses evaluated the Ramsay-score every 2 h and doses of sedatives were adapted accordingly. From January to March 2010 we assessed all ventilated patients every day from Monday till Friday. The subsequent four steps of the wean screen protocol were carried out to promote extubation. The amount of sedatives per month was divided by the number of ventilated patients, resulting in an average dose of midazolam/propofol/morfine per patient. The time spend on ventilators was calculated and all data were compared with the same period in 2009. Data were analysed with the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS. 160 and 163 patients were included in the 2009 and 2010 cohorts, respectively.",

Nature reviews, Molecular cell Biology (2010) 11 (1): 23-36 METHODS. Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia was induced in Male Sprague-Dawley rats. 48 h later the animals were connected to a ventilator with an injurious ventilation strategy (V T 12 ml/kg; 0 PEEP) for 3 h with or without a systemic administration of plasmaderived human AT (250 IE/kg). Broncho alveolar lavage fluid (BALf) was collected and analyzed for markers of lung injury and coagulopathy.RESULTS. Lung injury between the 2 groups was similar as measured by BALf protein levels no AT; 0.35 \u00b1 0.1 mg/ml and with AT; 0.35 \u00b1 0.07 mg/ml or total cell count no AT (1.7 \u00b1 0.8 cells 10 6 /ml) and treated with AT (1.9 \u00b1 0.8 cells 10 6 /ml). Systemic administration of plasma-derived human AT increased pulmonary levels of AT and reduced the level of TATc (fig).

Dits 1 1 ZNA Stuivenberg, Intensive Care Medicine, Antwerpen, Belgium, 2 Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 3 Akademiska Sjukhuset, Uppsala, SwedenINTRODUCTION. Gastric residual volume (GRV) is measured in a variety of ways, most often, the nasogastric tube is disconnected and the GRV is aspirated via a 60 cc syringe. Nurses experience this procedure as unpleasant and cumbersome. Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) has traditionally been estimated via bladder pressure (IBP).OBJECTIVES. This study looks at the validation of a novel method combining measurement of GRV and estimation of IAP via intragastric pressure (IGP).METHODS.In total 135 paired IAP and 146 paired GRV measurements were performed in 37 mechanically ventilated ICU patients. IAP was estimated by the height of the urine column via the bladder (i.e. IBP) using the FoleyManometer (Holtech Medical, Charlottenlund, Denmark) and via the stomach (i.e. IGP) with the new device (Gastro PV, Holtech Medical, Charlottenlund, Denmark). The GRV was measured with the new device (GRV proto ) and via the classic method (GRV classic ). Male to female ratio was 4:3, age 62.8 \u00b1 17.4 (range 22-86), BMI 26.3 \u00b1 6.3 (16.6-42.3), APACHE-II score 21.1 \u00b1 4.5 (11-31), SAPS-II score 50.4 \u00b1 12.1 (17-83), and SOFA score 9.3 \u00b1 3.1(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17). The number of measurements in each patient was 4 \u00b1 1. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS 13 TM software, values are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or median (range).",

Measurements of flow were important for determining the use of fluids as well as a guide to when to stop using fluids. This led to significantly overall less use of fluid in the HES group and less use of catecholamines in HES versus saline patients. (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier NCT00337805).

Overall MRC score was higher in the EMS group [56 (7) vs. 52 (18.5), p = 0.05]. Handgrip strength was evaluated in 21 patients (EMS group: 12, control group: 9), with EMS patients tending to perform higher than controls [(mean \u00b1 SD) 21.4 \u00b1 10.8 vs. 14.8 \u00b1 10.7 kg, p = 0.18).

EMS in ICU patients has a systemic beneficial outcome in strength,affecting not only muscle groups stimulated but also groups not applied. This form of exercise, being safe, well-tolerated and applicable in subjects unable to co-operate, constitutes an effective means of strength preservation, CIPNM prevention and early mobilization in critical illness.

The following groups were studied: (1) PAF (n = 5), 2) PAF + PAF antagonist (ABT491, n = 6), 3) PAF + thromboxane (SQ29548) and leukotriene (MK571) antagonist (SQ/MK, n = 6), 4) PAF + rho kinase inhibitor (Y27632, n = 3), 5) thromboxane agonist (U46619, n = 3), 6) thromboxane agonist + rho kinase inhibitor (U46/Y27, n = 3), 7) PAF + inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) (imipramine, n = 4) and 8) PAF + inhibitors of ASMase and cyclooxygenase (acetylsalicylic acid) (Imi/ASA, n = 5). All receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors were administered continuously 15 min before the end of a 60 min equilibration period. PAF or the thromboxane agonist were applied as boli. The dynamic pressure responses and the fluid shifts in the organ were recorded continuously. RESULTS. The area under the pressure response curve and the volume shift [vascular fluid loss (ml) within 15 min after stimulation normalized to intestine dry weight (g)] are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.",

To describe neurological signs or symptoms and to identify early predictors of outcome among adult HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU for neurological complications at the HAART era.METHODS. We performed a retrospective study of 445 consecutive HIV-patients admitted to the medical ICU of a university hospital in Paris from January 2001 through August 2008. RESULTS. 210 (47%) HIV-patients had evidence of neurological failure on ICU admission. Neurological findings (n = 286) were: delirium (n = 94), coma (n = 81), seizures (n = 68), intracranial hypertension (n = 43). Median CD4 count was 80 cells/lL [18-254]. Neurological failure revealed HIV infection in 40 (19%) patients. ICU-admission diagnoses were distributed into 3 groups: AIDS-associated CNS disease (G1): 88 (42%) patients, non-AIDSassociated CNS disease (G2): 45 (21%) patients, and general disease with neurological signs (G3): 77 (37%) patients. The leading cause of neurological failure was Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis (n = 47). Overall ICU-mortality was 30% and was not different between the 3 groups [G1: 22 (25%) patients, G2: 14 (31%) patients and G3: 26 (34%) patients, P = .45]. None of the HIV-related parameters (CD4 cell count, HIV viral load) were predictive of outcome. Multivariate analysis retained three factors present within 48 h of ICU admission and independently associated with in-ICU mortality: intracranial hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 5.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.17-11.91; P = .0002), SAPS 2 score (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.31-1.93; P \\ .0001) and use of vasopressors (OR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.78-8.60; P = .0007).CONCLUSIONS. Predictors of outcome in HIV-infected patients with neurological failure are identifiable at admission and depend rather on clinical presentation than on HIV-related parameters.

CI pc after 15 min significantly correlated to the subsequent CI td after 15 min (r = 0.979; p \\ 0.001). The change in CI pc after 15 min compared to CI td -baseline provided a ROC-AUC of 0.717 for the prediction of VR after 30 min.

CI td after a ''small 15 min VC'' accurately predicts VR after 30 min. Regarding several factors impeding the use of CVP, SVV and GEDI in a substantial number of patients, ''small VC'' seems to be a useful tool for hemodynamic assessment.INTRODUCTION. During septic shock, norepinephrine (NE) improves the cardiovascular status by increasing the arterial tone through its arterial vasoconstriction. Through venous vasoconstriction, it could also increase the venous return, the cardiac preload and the cardiac index in case of preload dependency, but this has never been investigated in septic shock patients.OBJECTIVES.To assess the effects of NE on cardiac preload, cardiac index and preload dependency during septic shock.CONCLUSIONS.In septic patients with a positive PLR at baseline suggesting the presence of preload dependency, NE increased cardiac preload and cardiac index and reduced the degree of preload dependency. Finally, even after increasing NE, the PLR test kept its value as an indicator of fluid responsiveness.CARDIAC CHAIR POSITION IMPROVES VENTILATION AND OXYGENATION IN MECHANICAL VENTILATED OBESE ICU PATIENTSF. van Beers 1 , J. van Rosmalen 1 , A. van Hees 1 , P. van Berkom 1 , J.A.H. van Oers 1 1 St. Elisabeth Hospital, ICU, Tilburg, The NetherlandsINTRODUCTION.Little is known about the physiological effects and beneficial mechanisms of lowering the legs (cardiac chair position) in ventilated obese patients. Objective effects of lowering the legs on the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), end tidal carbon dioxide (ET-CO 2 ) and the respiratory rate/tidal volume index (RR/Vt) were observed in ventilated obese patients who were on pressure support ventilation.OBJECTIVES. To improve the peripheral oxygen saturation, end tidal carbon dioxide and the respiratory rate/tidal volume index in ventilated obese patients by lowering the legs.CONCLUSIONS.We demonstrated an increase in SpO 2 and a decrease in ET-CO 2 when the legs of obese patients were lowered during pressure support ventilation. Relieve of abdominal pressure may play a role in this phenomenon. In this study obese patients were examined who were weaned from the ventilator. We believe, positional therapy in obese patients is very important. Just like the semi-recumbent position, lowering the legs is an easy, simple, effective and safe treatment in ICU patients. Due to the small number of patients additional work has to be done to confirm our observations.

(2007)Open and closed endotracheal suction systems in mechanical ventilated patients: a meta-analysis. Four focus group interviews with a total of 14 healthcare professionals working with mobilisation of obese ICU patients. The analysis of the interviews showed that it is more difficult to care for the obese patient, for reasons such as lack of space, non-availability of the correct equipment and available staff. Furthermore the attitude of the staff plays a significant role in the treatment and care of the obese when caregivers seem to be subjective in their treatment in a negative direction. 3. Study three is work in progress analysing data. Involving the staff through integration, debate and orientation is also an important part of the project in this phase.CONCLUSIONS. Only two of 17 patients were mobilised according to the clinical standard. Space, equipment and available staff members are needed if the clinical standard for mobilisation of the obese ICU patients has to be met. Implementation of the results of study 3 will hopefully increase the mobilisation rate of the obese ICU patients and improve the physical working environment around this group of patients.DOES THE TIME OF BYPASS SURGERY AFFECT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DELIRIUM AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY? O. Valles Fructuoso 1 , M. Diaz Torres 1 , J. Palmero Herrera 1 , L. Alvarez Vivas 1 , C. Olmos Aullon 1 1 Hospital Universitario de Bellvitge, Barcelona, SpainINTRODUCTION.Delirium is an acute deterioration of brain function characterized by fluctuating consciousness and the inability to sustain attention. Is a major problem and not uncommon after cardiac surgery. This table is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged stay and increased costs.OBJECTIVES.To determine whether a relationship exists between the time of bypass surgery and the development of delirium in patients after cardiac surgery.CONCLUSIONS. Prevention of delirium can contribute to improved patient recovery while avoiding an increase in the stay and the final cost of treatment, so it is important to establish a care plan aimed at the detection and prevention.

The aim of this study was to determine which patients the nurses defined as difficult and how often they encountered such patients. The study was carried out in two parts. The first part was a qualitative study on the difficult patient phenomenon. A data collection form which contained demographic data and semi-structured questions was used. We asked the questions on the data collection form to 36 nurses working at various departments of a training and research hospital using the face to face interview technique and recorded their responses. A list of the types of patients the nurses considered 'difficult' was obtained at the end of the first section. A table was created by adding literature data to this list. The table was arranged like a scale and two sections were placed next to 39 difficult patient definitions. The first section had the degree of accepting such a patient as difficult and the second section the frequency of encountering such patients. A 5-item Likert scale was used for both sections. RESULTS. The nurses categorized patients as difficult most commonly when they had communication problems or chronic pain while other common reasons were medical problems that were difficult to solve or frequent admissions with multiple problems. The most common 'difficult' patients were those that were bedridden, patient requiring constant care or dependant or nursing care and those with low socioeconomic, cultural or educational levels. The nurses stated that they used the following measures to cope with difficult patients: solving their problems quickly, acting in concert with the healthcare team, using positive communication techniques, dedicating time to the patient, and finally transferring the care of the patient to another nurse if it was not possible to solve the communication problems. CONCLUSIONS. We found that nurses categorized some patients as 'difficult' due to the patient's characteristics or their own personal characteristics. However, nurses continued the care of these patients by trying to develop positive attitudes both as an individual and as a team. We recommend holding meetings to develop coping and communication techniques, participation of all the healthcare team in the interventions regarding difficult patients and improving the working conditions and hours of nurses to help nurses successfully tackle the difficult patient phenomenon.VALIDATION OF THECAM-ICU AS PERFORMED BY BED-SIDE ICU NURSES: A MULTICENTRE STUDY M. van Eijk 1 , M. van den Boogaard 2 , P.

In 1995, Clapham et al investigated the way in which staff of a neurosurgical ICU performed the hyperinflation procedure. There were large variations in relation to the administered Tv observed, the TV ranged from 30 to 127% over the drafts of which were given by the ventilator, and mean airway pressures ranged from 24 to 96 cmH 2 O.CONCLUSIONS.A pressure gauge improves the accuracy and decrease the variability of the inspiratory pressure. This promotes patient safety and use of appropriate technology on manual hyperinflation.

To describe clinical features of patients with severe pneumonia admitted in ICU and to compare clinical characteristics and outcome according microbiological etiology: Influenza A (H1N1)v pneumonia versus non viral severe community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS. Descriptive study in a 17-beds medical-surgical ICU of a community hospital. Consecutive patients admitted in ICU from October 2009 to January 2010 with severe pneumonia were registered. Main variables of interest: age, APACHE II at admission, non invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, time of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, radiological pattern, cultures result, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, leukocytes count and mortality were collected. Patients were classified according the microbiological diagnosis.RESULTS. During the time of study 24 patients were admitted in ICU with severe pneumonia. In 15 patients microbiological diagnosis was confirmed with infection by influenza virus A (H1N1)v and in 9 patients pneumonia was caused by other microorganism. In the group of influenza pneumonia non invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 20% and mechanical ventilation in 80%, in the other group non invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 44.4% and mechanical ventilation in 88.9%.Table 1show the differences between groups.CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTSCONCLUSIONS.Our results do not support a role of the FCGR2A-H131R polymorphism in the susceptibility to CAP or PCAP.

At the time of OLB, DAD patients were more severely hypoxemic than OP patients. PEEP level was significantly higher in exudative DAD patients, while tidal volumes were not different and amounted to 6[5][6][7] ml/kg of PBW in all groups. DAD patients exhibited significantly higher global SOFA than OP patients, while respiratory SOFA was not different between groups. In broncho-alveolar lavage, the only significant difference was an increase in lymphocytes, as compared with DAD patients. 89 and 66% of OP and DAD patients received steroid treatment after OLB, respectively (NS). Time between respiratory symptoms onset and steroid treatment was significantly higher in organizing DAD patients, while time between ICU admission and steroid treatment onset was similar between groups. One patient relapsed after ICU discharge in both OP and DAD groups. Oxygen requirement was not different between groups at both ICU and hospital discharge.CONCLUSIONS.Prognosis of OP patients presenting as respiratory failure and treated with steroids, is significantly better than DAD, and may be better than previously reported.HOW CAN WE PREDICT OUTCOME AT ICU ADMISSION IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA?

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) may lead to death and long hospital stay.OBJECTIVES.To determine variables associated with poor outcome at intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with SCAP.CONCLUSIONS. In SCAP, SAPS3, PSI and pH on admission seem to predict 28-day mortality. CAP-PIRO performs well as 28-day and ICU mortality prediction tool in SCAP. WBC count and lactate provide potentially valuable prognostic information for 28-day and also in-hospital mortality.INTRODUCTION. The use of noninvasive ventilation in the treatment of acute respiratory failure due to community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a controversial issue (1), especially in patients with de novo acute respiratory failure (ARF), with a variable rate of success. Furthermore, there are well known risk factors for ventilatory failure of this modality in these patients OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of NIV in the treatment of severe CAP and to identify risk factors for failure of the technique METHODS. Prospective, observational study of all patients admitted to ICU with a diagnosis of severe CAP and treated with NIV. VNI success was defined as the avoidance of endotracheal intubation and survival in the ICU and at least 24 h on the medical ward with no signs or symptoms of respiratory failure. The variables are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation and percentages. Comparison between variables by Pearson's X2 test and Student T.

Three steps in the pathogenesis of ARDS could be defined: decrease of VEGF expression in alveolocytes, damage of surfactant and hyaline membranes constitution and subsequent apoptosis of the alveolar cells in those areas. Persistence of VEGFR1 immunostain in alveolar cells outside hyaline membranes areas proved that only a part of these cells were destroyed during ARDS.

To determine if plasma concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on admission predict mortality in non cardiologic ICU patients.METHODS.We performed a prospective study in a medical-surgical ICU of an university hospital. Patients admitted due to heart failure, acute coronary syndrome and cardiac surgery were excluded. Plasma BNP concentrations, demographic data, SAPS II and APACHE II, SOFA, laboratory data, and physiological variables were collected at admission.RESULTS.We included 55 patients (26 women) with a mean age of 57.1 \u00b1 18.7 years, SAPS II 46.6 \u00b1 16.1, APACHE II 17.2 \u00b1 8, SOFA 6.9 \u00b1 3. Patients who died (n = 13) had higher plasma concentrations of BNP 304 pg/mL [interquartile range (IQR) 113-1490] vs. 115 pg/mL (IQR 21-353) p = 0.02, SAPS II 56 \u00b1 13 versus 36 \u00b1 14 p \\ 0.001; APACHE II 25 \u00b1 9 versus 15 \u00b1 6 p \\ 0.001; and SOFA 9 \u00b1 3 versus 6 \u00b1 3 p = 0.02. No significant differences regarding age, gender and other physiological variables collected at admission were shown. The area under the ROC curve for predicting mortality in ICU was 0.74 for BNP (95% CI 0.58-0.9, p = 0.016). The cutoff of BNP on admission that best predicted mortality in ICU was 231 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 58%. The multivariate analysis revealed that APACHE II [odds ratio (OR) 1.21, p = 0.007] and BNP (OR 1.01, p = 0.005) were independent predictors of mortality in ICU.CONCLUSIONS. In non-cardiac ICU patients plasma BNP concentrations are frequently elevated and are independent predictors of mortality in ICU.INTRAARTERIAL LOCAL THROMBOLYSIS IMPROVES RIGHT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION AFTER PULMONARY EMBOLISM S.

Villanueva Fern\u00e1ndez 1 , A. Ortega L\u00f3pez 1 1 Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Spain OBJECTIVE. Management of pulmonary embolism (PE) with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and haemodynamic stability is controversial. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of local thrombolysis (LT) in a group of these patients and its impact on RV function. METHOD. Prospective study. Inclusion criteria: (1) haemodynamic stability (systolic arterial pressure [90 mmHg); (2) PE proven by helical CTA; (3) RV dysfunction defined by at least one of the following echocardiographic (ECO) parameters: subjective alteration of right ventricular contractility, RV diameter in the four chamber view [40 mm, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) \\15 mm and/or systolic pulmonary artery pressure [30 mmHg. All patients underwent angiography (ANG) and pulmonary artery catheterization with measurement of pulmonary pressures (PAP).LT was performed with urokinase (UK) (bolus of 100,000-200,000 UI plus a 100,000 UI/h infusion) or tPA (10 mg bolus plus a 40 mg infusion in 4 h).Both treatments were associated to an unfractioned heparin infusion (goal TTPA: 1.5 to 2 times control values).ICU monitoring after LT.ECO and ANG follow ups were done in all patients. Statistical method: Paired t test. Results are shown as mean difference between initial and final values with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.RESULTS. Twenty one patients. Thirteen males. Age 55 \u00b1 20 years. Initial symptom: dyspnea (90%).Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) on arrival: 131 \u00b1 26 mmHg, heart rate (HR): 108 \u00b1 21 bpm. Median Troponin I on admission: 0.3 lg/mL (range 0.05 to 6.8); median proBNP on admission: 2004 pg/mL (range 68 to 13310).All patients had thrombus occupying the main pulmonary artery in the CTA.ECO: 28% had severe RV dysfunction, 44% moderate, 17% mild and 11% had a normal function; RV diameter 46 \u00b1 7 mm; TAPSE 15 \u00b1 2 mm. ANG: systolic PAP: 48 \u00b1 12 mmHg; diastolic PAP: 25 \u00b1 9 mmHg; mean PAP 35 \u00b1 8 mmHg.Twenty patients received UK, one received tPA. Mean time of LT 53 h (range 4-84).Mean decrease of HR after LT: 28 bpm [IC95 (19-37), p \\ 0.001].Control ANG: nineteen patients had radiological improvement (85%), four of them had a complete resolution. Mean reduction of PAP after LT: systolic PAP: 16 mmHg [95 CI (10-22), p \\ 0.001]; diastolic PAP: 10 mmHg [95 CI (7-13), p \\ 0.001] and mean PAP: 13 mmHg [95 CI (10-15), p \\ 0.001].Control ECO (1-7 days after LT): 24% had mild RV dysfunction, the rest of them had a normal contractility of the RV; mean reduction of RV diameter: 9.7 mm [IC95 (6-13), p \\ 0.001]; mean rise of TAPSE: 8.5 mm [95 CI(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11), p \\ 0.001].Complications: LT was associated with a decrease in the levels of fibrinogen and platelets, the lowest levels achieved were 120 mg/dL and 73,000 cel/mm 3 respectively. Seven patients had mild haematomas at the puncture site. One had hematuria that resolved after stopping the treatment. All patients survived.CONCLUSION. LT in this group of patients improved RV function rapidly and was associated with mild complications.NIRS GUIDED HEMODYNAMIC THERAPY IN CARDIAC SURGERY PATIENT-S:THE NIGHT STUDY E.S. Tripodaki 1 , L.

CT scan was performed after 8.8 \u00b1 4.5 days of mechanical ventilation (MV).PE was diagnosed in 12 (14.8%) patients; mean age: 54 \u00b1 17; 91% males. The mean duration of MV before PE diagnosis was 11.9 \u00b1 6.6 days. PE was unilateral in 91.6%; lobar in 33.3%, segmental in 33.3%, subsegmental in 16.7% and both lobar and segmental in 16.7%. PE occurred despite preventive or curative anticoagulation in 58.3% and 33.3% of cases respectively. PE was not suspected in 9 (75%) patients before diagnosis and was associated with a DVT of the lower limbs in 7 (58.3%) cases. In the patients without PE, 9 (13%) DVT were diagnosed. DVT, with or without PE, was associated with the presence of a central venous catheter (CVC) at diagnosis or within the 10 previous days in 11 (73.3%). Seven (46.6%) DVT were found in the upper limbs and 8 (53.3%) in the lower limbs. All the cases of PE with a DVT (6) were lower limbs DVT and 4 (66.7%) of them were associated with a CVC.CONCLUSIONS. Pulmonary embolism is frequently undiagnosed in ICU patients and occurred despite the use of thromboprophylaxis or curative anticoagulant treatment. Risk factors and outcome are being studied in a larger population.REFERENCE.Patel R, Burden of illness in venous thromboembolism in critical care: a multicenter observational study, J crit care 2005.

The carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide (ACZ) reduces HPV in isolated lungs, intact animals and in humans 1 . The efficacy against HPV is not due to CA inhibition, since selective inhibition of either intracellular or extracellular CA by other potent but structurally different CA-inhibiting sulfonamides does not reduce HPV 2 . As compared to ACZ, n-methyl acetazolamide (NMA), possesses a simple uncharged additional methyl group at the sulfonamide moiety of ACZ, thereby lacking any CA inhibitory property. In isolated pulmonary artery smooth muscles, ACZ and NMA block hypoxia-mediated intracellular calcium increase. We hypothesized that NMA would effectively reduce HPV in conscious spontaneously breathing dogs without the systemic side effects of CA inhibition.OBJECTIVES.To test the effects of NMA on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in conscious dogs.METHODS. Five female Beagle dogs were kept under standardized environmental conditions. Each dog was studied twice in randomized order. Protocol 1: NMA (10 mg/kg bolus, followed by 10 mg/kg/h continuously). Protocol 2: Controls, without NMA. During all experiments dogs breathed spontaneously via a ventilator circuit. First hour: Normoxia (F i O 2 = 0.21); followed by 2 h of hypoxia (F i O 2 = 0.1). Arterial oxygen tension (P a O 2 ), mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were determined at the end of each experimental hour. Data are given as means \u00b1 SEM; * p \\ 0.05 vs. normoxia; p \\ 0.05 vs. Controls (GLM ANOVA).RESULTS. During hypoxia P a O 2 was 36 \u00b1 1 mmHg in Controls and 38 \u00b1 1 mmHg with NMA. In Controls, MPAP increased by 7 \u00b1 1 mmHg and PVR increased by 182 \u00b1 20 dyn s cm -5 after 2 h of hypoxia (* p \\ 0.05). With NMA, MPAP increased by 3 \u00b1 1 mmHg and PVR by 74 \u00b1 40 dyn s cm -5 during hypoxia ( p \\ 0.05).",

To analyze the ability of several clinical variables and biomarkers to predict disease severity in patients with suspicious of infection in the emergency department (ED). METHODS. Prospective observational study. Population: all adult patients admitted in the ED with blood culture withdrawal with bacterial infection suspicion. Place: University hospital of 624 beds, with around 25,000 medical emergencies assisted yearly. Study duration: from March 1st to April 30 th 2009. Variables: Age, gender, comorbidities according to Charlson index, presence of leukocyte count above 15 9 109/L, presence of neutrophil band cells, presence of neutropenia, level of C reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), proadrenomedullin (ProADM), neopterin and final diagnose. Disease severity events were defined as: admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or death within the first 7 days after admission. Data was analyzed by statistical package SPSS 14.0 for Windows.RESULTS. Blood cultures were obtained from 457 patients. 45 of them weren't included due to not enough data. Mean age 69 years (54-78), being 60.4% male. The most frequent diagnose was community acquired pneumonia: 87 (21.1%). Blood cultures were positive in 53 (12.8%) being the most frequently isolated microorganism E. coli: 18 (33.3%). 34 cases (8.2%) fulfilled severity criteria: 21 (5%) deaths, 14 (3.3%) admission in the ICU. In 47% of them an infection was proved and in other 26.4% was considered likely infection. Distribution of the variables in the univariate and multivariate analysis is shown inTable 1. The multivariate analysis showed as independent variables associated with severity: gender, PCT and proADM. The diagnostic yield of the biomarkers predicting severity is shown inTable 2. PCT and proADM show high negative predictive value.TABLE 1 DISTRIBUTION OF VARIABLES. DISEASE SEVERITY CONCLUSIONS. In patients with suspicious of infection in the emergency room, PCT and proADM make possible to define a group with low severity.

The incidence of SA nasal carriage among health care workers is poorly known. New techniques for rapid detection by PCR are now available. OBJECTIVES. The objective of this study was to evaluate the proportion of SA carriage in medical healthy volunteers at the Conference of the French Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine in 2009 (SFAR). METHODS. Anonymous nasal screening of SA in volunteers has been proposed in a booth during the congress. An anonymous questionnaire was completed containing demographic data, professional practice and epidemiological knowledge on MRSA (methicillin-resistant SA). A double nasal swab was performed and the analysis made in real time by the test Xpert MRSA/SA (Cepheid) with GenXpert system (Cepheid). The results were given back to volunteers anonymously within an hour. Two groups were formed based on the presence or absence of SA. Resistance to methicillin was evaluated for positive patients. RESULTS. 289 screening tests were performed. The population was predominantly male (70.2%), mean age 48 \u00b1 10 years, working in university hospitals (44%), in general hospitals (34%) and private hospitals (22%). 32% of volunteers were screened positive for SA, including 8% of MRSA. The group of volunteers SA + versus the SA -group, was more frequently male (87 vs. 69%, p = 0.001), working in ICU (38 vs. 28%, p = 0.1). There was no difference regarding the type of structure and number of beds. 93% of practitioners are in regular contact with MRSA, but only 17% know its prevalence within their hospital. Only 59% are screening patients at risk and 14% had the result available of this test in less than 24 h. Only 43% of practitioners perform the isolation of patients with MRSA. 80% of practitioners change their protocol of antibiotic prophylaxis if the screening test result is positive.CONCLUSIONS. One third of medical volunteers, mostly male anesthetists working in ICU, is positive for a screening for nasal SA. The proportion of MRSA is very low, but the question of targeted nasal decontamination is asked. Medical knowledge about the management of MRSA is still very weak. TOWARD AN OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS IN SEPSIS: A LATENT CLASS APPROACH F. Jaimes 1,2 , G. De La Rosa 2 , M. Valencia 1 , C. Arango 1 , C. Gomez 2 , A. Garcia 2 , S. Ospina 3 , S. Osorno 1 , A. Henao 1 1 Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia, 2 Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe, Medellin, Colombia, 3 Hospital Universitario San Vicente de Paul, Medellin, Colombia INTRODUCTION. Three potential biomarkers have shown a regular presence in systemic infections: C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), and D-dimer (DD); the latter as an unspecific signal of coagulation activation. So far, however, no large prospective studies support any of them as a single independent criterion for sepsis. Furthermore, the lack of a reference test has hampered the assessment of the accuracy of biomarkers to diagnose sepsis.OBJECTIVES.To estimate the operative characteristics of CRP, PCT and DD as diagnostic tests for sepsis in patients admitted to hospital care with a presumptive infection as main diagnosis.METHODS. Prospective study conducted betweenAugust 2007 and February 2009. Patients were enrolled if they were hospitalized in the emergency room (ER) with at least one of the following as admission diagnosis: any type of infection, fever of unknown origin, delirium of unknown origin or acute hypotension not explained by other syndromes. Serum levels of CRP, PCT and DD were determined within 24 h of admission. The patients were classified as no infection or sepsis by an expert consensus committee, blinded to the results of the index tests, on the basis of all the daily clinical and microbiological data collected during the first seven days of hospitalization. Additionally, a latent class analysis (LCA) with random effects was used to estimate the likelihood of belong to the latent cluster ''sepsis'' in the study populationRESULTS. Among 765 recruited participants CRP was measured from 748, PCT from 747 and DD from 744 patients. The main admission diagnosis in 505 sepsis patients (66%), according to the expert consensus, was community-acquired pneumonia (23%), followed by urinary tract infection (17%) and soft tissue infection (16%). Severe sepsis defined by a SOFA score C2 in any domain was recorded in 337 patients (67%). A microbiological diagnosis was confirmed in 221 (44%) sepsis patients. The LCA with a PCT cutoff point of 2 ng/ml (AUC = 0.95, LR + = 10.6, LR -= 0.09) identified a cluster of patients with higher mortality (17 vs. 9%), higher rate of positive blood cultures (39 vs. 12%) and higher values of lactate, SOFA and APACHE II scores. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for each biomarker compared to consensus expert are shown in theTable.AUCS ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT GOLD STANDARD CONCLUSIONS. In this cohort of ER patients suspected of having any infection; CRP, DD and PCT were not significantly able to discriminate, according to a consensus diagnosis, sepsis from no sepsis patients. Using LCA, however, a cutoff point for PCT higher than the usually recommended seems able to confirm and to discard those more acutely ill patients.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

Of the 46 positive blood cultures obtained from new venous stab, 12 grew at least one nonskin-commensal organism, 34 grew only skin commensal organisms with 9 of these (representing 8 episodes) having a matching central line tip culture. The pattern of organisms isolated from intravascular line samples and new venous stab was similar.CONCLUSIONS. The frequency of positive blood cultures in this UK critical care sample is comparable to that in other studies. The pick up rate for pathogens was low in this population. The growth of skin commensal organisms was frequent, suggesting contamination, although line colonisation/infection accompanied a quarter of clean stab skin-commensal positive cultures. Overall, positive results had little impact on clinical decision making. REFERENCE(S). 1.

In the Critical Care Unit (CCU) of the Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universidad de Chile (HCUCH), the problem of nosocomial infections is an important goal inside the Local Quality Programme. Protocols and standards have emerged aimed at maximizing surveillance, monitoring and control of risk factors for nosocomial infections. These strategies generate the need to monitor our CCU baseline. Compliance with medical indication of certain invasive procedures such as central venous access (CVC) and urinary catheter stay (CUP), are factors to evaluate in these protocols, to reduce the risks of infection associated. OBJECTIVES. Assessing compliance with medical indications for invasive procedures type CUP and CVC, based on local recommendations of the Committee of Nosocomial Infections (CIIH) of HCUCH and international Society of Health Epidemiology of America and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (SHEA/IDSA). METHODS. We monitored two specific procedures required by the guidelines of CIIH-HCUCH, indications of CVC and CUP. The guidelines are based on standard recommendations of the Manual of CIIH-HCUCH and international recommendations SHEA/IDSA. The period was from April to December 2009. It took the total UPC which has 12 beds in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 15 beds in the Medical Middle-Care Unit (MMCU) and 28 beds in the Surgical Middle-Care Unit (SMCU). The implementation of guidelines was conducted by medical resident during 1 month, with shift monthly the medical resident. The data collected were managed in database, with expression in medians, and percentages. RESULTS. In our CCU had 4340 admissions in period April-December 2009. The ICU admissions were 484, 867 were in MMCU and 2989 in SMCU. We applied a total of 1853 supervision's patterns, covering the CCU in its entirety. 53.4% (990 patterns) was invaded at the time of supervision. 699 patterns were performed in the ICU (37.7%), 640 patterns in MMCU (34.5%), and 739 patterns in SMCU (39.9%). The distribution pattern of CVC was 954 (51.5%) and 899 patterns CUP (48.5%). In 19.2% of CUP patterns (92 patterns) and 10.4% of CVC guidelines (53 guidelines), showed no medical indication of invasion at the time of supervision. Indications not mentioned by CIIH, monitoring in oncological abdominal surgery (33%), spinal trauma surgery (25%) and skin protection in the management of pressure ulcers (18%) were the most representative CUP. The CVC for renal replacement therapy (50%) were not included in local recommendations. CONCLUSIONS. There was a 19.2% of CUP guidelines and 10.4% of CVC guidelines in the period monitored, without a medical indication of invasion, which implies an important responsibility of the treating team. The supervision of medical indications for invasive procedures is an important process under surveillance and especially prevention of intrahospitalary infections.

Fabre 1 1 Virgen de la Concha Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Zamora, Spain, 2 Virgen de la Concha Hospital, Paediatrics, Zamora, Spain OBJECTIVES. To determine the variables associated with the prognosis of critically ill septic patients on admissions to the ICU.METHODS. This retrospective study was carried out in a polyvalent ICU of a secondary hospital from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009. All patients meeting criteria for sepsis on admission to the ICU. The following variables were recorded: gender, age, chronic organ insufficiencies (liver, renal, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and inmunosuppression), comorbidities (alcoholism, smoking habit, diabetes mellitus, non-core malignancy, and previous surgery or sepsis), previous antibiotic therapy, nosocomial infection, bacteraemia, culture of focus, site of infection, appropriateness of empirical antibiotics and failure of organs on admission by SOFA scale and during the clinical course. The statistical analysis was performance with SPSS 11.5.1. The association between the variables and death was accomplished using Student's t test for parametric continuous variables, and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Survival analysis by log-rank and Cox regression multivariate analysis was made to identify the independent factors associated with mortality.RESULTS. One hundred and forty nine patients were included at ICU admission. Sepsis was present in 22 patients (14.8%), severe sepsis in 33 (22.1%), and septic shock in 95 (63.8%). The mean age was 66 years and 61.1% were male. The mortality rate was 39%. Regarding surviving patients, SOFA score who died was greater 11 (SD 8.2), p = 0.01. The mean age of the patients who died was greater, 70.1 years (SD 10.6), than in surviving ones, 63.9 years (SD 15.3), p = 0.031. Factors associated with mortality in the ICU, were the gender (47.3% in male regarding 27.6% in woman, p = 0.017), non-core malignancy (58.3%, p = 0.CONCLUSIONS. The prognosis of sepsis in males and older patients is worse. Regarding comorbidities, non-core malignancy was associated with mortality rate. Septic shock, greater SOFA score, respiratory failure and cardiovascular failure implies a higher mortality rate. The adequate empirical antibiotic was associated with a reduction in this rate.PANDEMIC INFLUENZA H1N1: HOW DID WE DEAL WITH IT! J.M. Pereira 1 , C. Basilio 1 , C. Sousa Dias 1 , L. Santos 2 , A.

Evaluation of current indications for blood cultures, antibiotic treatments (ABT).METHODS. Prospective observational study of adult patients consecutively admitted to an ICU who were taken BC from March to November 2009. Demographics, clinical data and laboratory tests at the time of collection of the BC were collected, as well as the BC indication and ABT. ABT was classified as adequate in terms of susceptibility received. Qualitative variables are expressed as percentage and quantitative variables as mean and standard deviation. logistic regression was performed of multivariate analysis. We considered statistically significant a p value \\.05.RESULTS. 336 BC were included of 194 patients. Mean age 59.6 \u00b1 17.1. ICU stay 10.4 \u00b1 11.6 days (hospital 29.6 \u00b1 26.3d). Hospital mortality rate 32.5%. Patients were medical (63.6%), surgical (32%). BC indications: fever peak (60.7%), severe sepsis/septic shock (24.7%). The most commonly used ABT were cefotaxime and imipenem. Source of infection: abdominal (37.5%), respiratory (31.2%). Results of BC: 79 positive (23.5%), 257 negative (76.5%). The most commonly isolated microorganisms were E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae. Appropriate empirical treatment: 84.8% of cases with positive BC. The factors that maintain independent association with outcome were CRP (p \\ .001, OR 1.005; 1.002-1.008) and SOFA (p = .006, OR = 1.138; 1.037-1.248). UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS CONCLUSIONS. In our sample, the levels of CRP and the SOFA value at the time of the BC were independently associated with the presence of bloodstream infection, defined as the presence of positive blood culture. The most common indications were the presence of persistent fever/fever peak and severe sepsis/septic shock. We got a 23.5% of positive BC, with E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae as the most commonly isolated microorganisms. Cefotaxime and imipenem were the most commonly used ABT.

Walden 1 1 The John Radcliffe Hospital, Acute Medical Unit, Oxfordshire, UK INTRODUCTION. Sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide. Delays in prompt antibiotic therapy in severe sepsis contributes to 10-15% increase in mortality rates. 1 International standards recommend administration of broad spectrum antibiotics within 3 h of presentation in patients with sepsis. 2OBJECTIVES.To assess the length of time from admission to administration of first dose antibiotic in patients with suspected sepsis, in an acute medical setting. We hypothesised that the following could contribute to a delay in antibiotic administration 1. admission method; emergency department versus community, 2. route of administration; oral vs. intravenous, 3. prescription method; immediate (once only) vs. regular prescriptions), and 4. source of infection.METHODS.Prospective study over two-week periods in an acute medical unit: cycle one (May 2009) and cycle two (December 2009). Inclusion criteria included all adult patients prescribed antibiotic therapy in suspected sepsis with documented source of infection.RESULTS.Cycle one (n = 51) mean time from admission to administration of first dose antibiotic was 5:33 \u00b1 4:53 h. The method of prescription was statistically significant (p = 0.002, unpaired t test), with 'once only' prescriptions administered up to 2.4 times quicker than regular prescriptions.Recommendations from cycle one lead to the prescription of first dose antibiotic on the 'once only' section of the drug chart being incorporated into antibiotic guidelines.Cycle two (n = 63) mean time from admission to administration of first dose antibiotic was 4.04 \u00b1 3.42 h. There was not a statistically significant uptake of intervention by clinical staff.

In Spain, 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in 2001. Several studies have shown a decrease in the pneumococcal disease (PD) in children. The effect on adults is still not well known.OBJECTIVE. to determine if there is a change in the incidence, complications and severity of the PD after the introduction of the 7-valent conjugated vaccine.METHODS.Observational study of patients with PD admitted to an Intensive Care Unit of a teaching hospital. The period of the study was from January 2000 until December 2009. Epidemiological data, clinical course, complications and mortality rate were obtained from hospital's records. Statistical tests: Chi-square, Fisher test, Student's t, U Mann-Whitney and logistic regression analysis.RESULTS. 163 patients from the 8,548 total admissions at ICU during that period of time were studied. 62% were men, mean age 54.54 (16.85-82.90) years. Diagnose was performed by 2 or more methods in 47.9%, blood cultures in 20.5%, urinary antigen testing in 12.2%, pleural fluid in 1.3%, sputum in 9% and cerebrospinal fluid in 7.1%. APACHE-III at admittance was 67 (12-188). Comorbidities were present in 77.3% of the patients. The cause of admittance was meningitis in 23.9% and pneumonia in 74.2%. Patients affected with meningitis were older (p = 0.004) than those affected with pneumonia. During these years, the PD has shown a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0043) in the number of patients admitted and the in cases of pneumonia while the number of pneumococcal meningitis remained stable. Pleural effusion was developed by 21.2% of the patients. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in 59.7% of patients with pneumonia and 73.7% in patients affected with meningitis. Worst GCS at UCI in patients with meningitis was 7 (3-15). ICU length of stay was 8 (1-109) days. Mortality rate in patients with meningitis and pneumonia was 28.2 and 22.7% respectively (NS). The respiratory (38.4 vs. 1.7% p \\ 0.001) and renal failures (38.9 vs. 11.6% p \\ 0.0001) were significantly associated with a higher mortality. Neurological sequelae after meningitis were observed in 58.1% of the patients. The main risk factors associated with mortality CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of PD in our ICU has significantly increased after the introduction of PCV7 in our area. Patients have a high proportion of comorbidities. PD was associated with a high rate of complications. Patients with HIV infection have the worst outcome.REFERENCE. Lexau CA et al.

INFUSION TIME OF PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM AND OPTIMAL CLINICAL OUT-COMES IN PSEUDOMONA AERUGINOSA INFECTIONS IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS D. Soy 1,2 , E. Carcelero 1 1 Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Pharmacy Service, Barcelona, Spain, 2 CIBERES (CIBER de Enfermedades Respiratorias, 06/06/0028), IDIBAPS. University of Barcelona, Barcelona, SpainINTRODUCTION. Severe infections in ICU patients due to P. aeruginosa are related to higher morbi-mortality. Timely and adequate antibiotic treatment is fully justified according to resistance data. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) becomes a surrogate of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of the combining infecting bacteria and drug. As pathogens become more resistant, treatment failure using standard dosing regimens increases. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in ICU patients is too variable to optimize therapeutic outcome by using the standard dosages. Monte Carlo simulations facilitate to theoretically forecast the probability of PK/PD target attainment. Regarding b-lactams, the PK/PD index that best correlates with clinical and bacteriological efficacy is the time for which the free serum drug concentration exceeds the MIC: fT SS [ MIC . In order to optimize it, continuous or extended IV infusions have been proposed. 99 and 100% of patients, respectively. These results improve when renal impairment is present. CONCLUSIONS. PT administered either as a continuous or extended infusion (3 h) might increase the likelihood of microbiological eradication and clinical outcome in ICU patients and high MICs for P. aeruginosa. REFERENCE(S). None. surveillance of contemporary isolates coupled with PD modeling will aid optimal dosing of currently available carbapenems. Prolonged infusion is a popular administration method for optimizing PD of the carbapenems while retaining room temperature stability. OBJECTIVES. The aim of this PASSPORT (Probability of target attainment of Antibacterial agents Studied for Susceptibility and Pharmacodynamic Optimization in Regional Trials) study was to determine the probability of obtaining bactericidal PD exposures for various carbapenem dosing regimens against PSA and AB collected in European ICUs.",

A Critical Care Influenza Pandemic Contingency plan was made in preparation for this outbreak. MR. H1N1 VS. MR. ST. PNEUMONIAE: HOW DIFFERENT ARE THEY\u2026 OR NOT? PSI, SAPS3 and SOFA scores. H1N1 SCAP is associated not only with a longer delay in starting appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment but also with its longer duration. PCT, lactate and BNP could be helpful tools to distinguish between these two pathogens at ICU admission. No differences were found regarding outcome. REFERENCE(S). None In this cohort, PSI score performed reasonably as an ICU and hospital outcome prediction tool and helped to classify patients with increasing risk of death. However, it should be used with caution as a triage instrument as demonstrated by a significant mortality rate in patients considered not meeting even the criteria for hospital admission. Septic shock and acute coronary syndrome significantly increase ICU mortality in patients with low risk of death calculated by PSI score. REFERENCE(S). Michael J. Fine, Thomas E. Auble, Donald M. Yealy et al. A prediction rule to identify low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia. N Eng J Med 1997;336:243-50 was found. ICU-mortality was 28.3%. No difference on ICU mortality was found when comparing patients who receive and not receive ECMO (28.3 vs. 26.1%, p = 0.41). ICU mortality in ECMO patients was associated with PO2/FiO2 ratio \\100 mmHg (OR = 3.30 95% CI 1.05-10.32).CONCLUSIONS. The presence of a lower PO2/FiO2 ratio at admission was associated with the use of ECMO therapy in pandemic (H1N1)v patients. In addition, a PO2/FiO2 \\100 mmHg at start of the therapy was the only variable associated with worse outcomes in patients receiving ECMO therapy.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT. Endorsed by ECCRN.OBJECTIVES.

Propofol is commonly used to provide continuous sedation in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) is a rare but potentially fatal complication that has been described in children 1 and adults. It is characterised by the development of metabolic acidosis, lipaemia, rhabdomyolysis and myocardial failure. Risk factors include high-dose propofol, traumatic brain injury (TBI) 2 , critical illness and the use of corticosteroids and catecholamines. METHODS. In this paper we report the clinical course of two patients admitted to ICU with TBI who developed features suggestive of PRIS. Both patients received prolonged infusions of propofol (average daily dose of 4 mg/kg/h) and required active cooling for management of intracranial pressure (ICP). RESULTS. Case 1: A 23 year old man with severe TBI was initially sedated with propofol and fentanyl. Midazolam was added in view of raised ICP and he was actively cooled to 34-35\u00b0C. On day 5 he developed infero-lateral T wave inversion on the ECG. 2 days later he developed widespread ST segment elevation (Brugada-like ECG pattern) with a raised troponin; the propofol infusion was stopped. The ECG improved although there was persistent T wave inversion. On day 12 he became cardiovascularly unstable with increasing vasopressor requirements finally resulting in cardiac arrest. A post mortem study revealed the presence of normal coronary arteries. Case 2: A 21 year old man with severe TBI was sedated with increasing doses of propofol and fentanyl for raised ICP. Midazolam was added on day 2 and he was actively cooled to 34\u00b0C. On day 4 the patient developed a mild lactic acidosis and 3 days later he developed infero-lateral ST segment elevation on the ECG followed rapidly by cardiac arrest and death.",

Paracentesis of 6162 \u00b1 3100 ml resulted in significant reduction of SVRI and CVP, probably due to reduced intraabdominal pressure.

Determine if bowel irrigation is applied uniformly across diagnostic categories in the Burn Unit. The hypothesis is that with capillary leakage and third space accumulation, output in patients with bowel catheters, who have Burns/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TENS) will be greater than in patients with other dermatologic conditions.CONCLUSIONS.There was statistically more Irrigation fluid input and Bowel fluid output in the Other skin condition group compared to the Burns/TENS group. Severity of illness, start time for irrigation, the number of irrigations/time period, and sepsis may have affected this result.

The RIFLE classification for acute kidney injury (AKI) is based on relative changes in serum creatinine (SCr) and on urine output (respectively RIFLE SCr and RIFLE uo ). The criteria that lead to the worst possible classification determines the final RIFLE class (RIFLE final ). The RIFLE SCr require an actual pre-morbid baseline value. When this value is unknown, current recommendations are to estimate the baseline SCr by the Modification of Diet Renal Disease (MDRD) equation[1]. This method was shown to result in bi-directional misclassification of the RIFLE SCr class, however, the impact of this method on the RIFLE final class were not reported[2]. OBJECTIVES. We compared the maximum RIFLE SCr based on the premorbid SCr (aRIFLE SCr ) with that based on the estimated SCr (eRIFLE SCr ) and determined the effect on the RIFLE final METHODS. Prospective observational study during a 6-month period in patients of C18 years admitted to the ICU for at least 48 h and with a known pre-morbid SCr. The lesser of ICU-admission SCr and premorbid SCr was defined as the actual baseline. Likewise, the lesser of ICU-admission and MDRD based SCr was defined as the estimated baseline. In each patient we calculated the worst AKI score during the first seven ICU days, based on respectively the aRIFLE SCr , aRIFLE final , eRIFLE SCr and eRIFLE final . RESULTS. A pre-morbid SCr was available in 101 (39%) out of the 259 analyzed patients. Mean age and APACHE II score were respectively 64 \u00b1 13 years and 22 \u00b1 7. The frequency of misclassification of RIFLE SCr and RIFLE final are shown inTables 1 and 2respectively. RIFLESCR ACCORDING TO ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED SCR RIFLEFINAL ACCORDING TO ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED SCR The eRIFLE SCr overestimated AKI in 22 (21.8%) patients and underestimated AKI in 7 (7%) patients, while the eRIFLE final overestimated AKI in 4 patients (4%) and underestimated AKI in 2 patients (2%). CONCLUSIONS. Estimating the SCr baseline results in bi-directional misclassification of the RIFLE SCr class. The original RIFLE classification, however, is based on SCr and urine output criteria. When the urine output is taken into consideration the impact of a surrogate baseline on the misclassification of AKI is less pronounced. REFERENCE(S). 1. Bellomo et al. Crit Care 2004;8:R204-R212 2.

Increased glomerular filtration (GFR) or hyperfiltration has been reported in ICU patients, and may be associated with inadequate antibiotic drug concentrations, and as a consequence, worse outcomes. Routine creatinine measurements lack sensitivity and specificity. Hence, assessment of hyperfiltration may be problematic. OBJECTIVES. Evaluation of methods for assessment of GFR in a cohort of ICU patients with hyperfiltration. METHODS. Single center prospective cohort study in the ICU of the Ghent University Hospital. Inclusion criteria were age C18 years, informed consent, urinary creatinine clearance (Ccr) [120 mL/min on the day preceding the study, and presence of urinary catheter, central venous catheter and arterial catheter. GFR was assessed with an urinary inulin clearance (Cin) as gold standard, and compared to serum creatinine and Cystatin, 2 and 24-h Ccr, the Cockcroft-Gault (CG), MDRD and MDRDs equations for GFR, and cystatin-C based equations for GFR (Hoek, Filler, Larsson, Le Bricon). Comparison was with the Wilcoxon test and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Bias was assessed by the mean difference between Cin and different methods, precision by standard deviation (SD) of the bias.RESULTS. 23 patients were included in the study, 74% were male, and median age was 50 y (interquartile range, 36-62). APACHE II score on admission was 14.6 (SD 7), and SOFA score at time of study was 2 (SD 2.1). Cin was 129.6 (SD 72.5) mL/min, creatinine 0.49 mg/ dL (SD, 0.19), and Cystatin C 0.79 mg/dL (SD 0.60). There was a relative good correlation between Cin and 1/Cystatin C (r = 0.542, p = 0.008), and no correlation with 1/creatinine (r = 0.149, p = 0.424). Comparisons with Cin are illustrated in theTable.ASSESSMENT OF GFR VS. CIN CONCLUSIONS. In a cohort of ICU patients with hyperfiltration, none of the tested methods for assessment of GFR were adequate compared to the gold standard Cin. The Cystatin C derived equations, especially Larsson, performed best for assessment of GFR, because bias was minimal, however, precision was weak.WHOLE-BLOOD NEUTROPHIL GELATINASE-ASSOCIATED LIPOCALIN (NGAL) AS A PREDICTOR OF ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTSK.

Betbes\u00e9 1 1 Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Intensive Care Unit, Barcelona, Spain, 2 Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Biochemistry, Barcelona, Spain INTRODUCTION. Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care units (ICU) is associated with a high in-hospital mortality, between 45 and 60% of cases. Early detection of AKI could be crucial to develop therapeutic strategies that could modify the AKI course as far as possible. Blood and urinary concentrations of NGAL are early biomarkers of AKI [1]; NGAL is also an acute phase protein which can be elevated in other processes like systemic immune response system (SIRS), sepsis and septic shock. Most studies about the NGAL value to predict AKI were done in patients after cardiac surgery and little information exists regarding NGAL usefulness in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVES. To analyze: 1. the capacity of whole-blood NGAL (wbNGAL) to predict AKI-evaluated by RIFLE score-in critically ill patients and, 2. the wbNGAL values in patients with SIRS, sepsis or septic shock. METHODS. NGAL was measured in whole-blood by a point-of-care device (Triage \u00d2 NGAL Test, Inverness Medical Innovations) at admission and 48 h later in patients admitted to a general ICU. Patients were classified both by RIFLE score at admission and 24 and 48 h later and by wbNGAL concentrations at admission. To the later classification, the cut-point for AKI prediction was obtained by ROC curve analysis. wbNGAL values at admission were compared in patients with SIRS, severe sepsis or septic shock. Clinicians were blinded to NGAL results. RESULTS. The study included 100 consecutively-admitted patients (40 female) with mean age 59.1 \u00b1 17.8 years, and length of ICU stay of 10.3 \u00b1 9.6 days. Seventy-one developed SIRS, 9 severe sepsis and 20 septic shock. Eigtheen patients developed RIFLE F score, 14 of them at ICU admission; extracorporeal renal therapies were required in 9 cases. When patients were classified according to their RIFLE score at 24 h of admission, wbNGAL values at admission were 71 (60-167) ng/mL in 61 patients with RIFLE 0, 186 (87-330) ng/mL in 7 with RIFLE R, 381 (299-445) ng/mL in 10 with RIFLE I and 558 (246-1,060) ng/mL in 15 with RIFLE F (p = 0.0001). Four patients were discharged before 24 h [wbNGAL 384 (60-783) ng/mL]; whereas the 3 patients who died before 24 h had wbNGAL at admission of 685 (187-862) ng/mL. The area under ROC curve of wbNGAL at admission for AKI prediction was 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.76-0.91, p = 0.0001), with an optimal cutoff value of 178 ng/mL with 77% sensitivity and 79% specificity. Fifty-five patients have NGAL B 178 ng/mL. wbNGAL concentrations at admission were 81 (60-187) ng/mL in 71 patients with SIRS, 261 (193-481) ng/mL in 9 patients with severe sepsis and 623.5 (361-798) ng/mL in 20 patients with septic shock (p \\ 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS. Whole blood NGAL concentrations measured at ICU admission appeared as an useful predictor of AKI in critically ill patients; in addition, wbNGAL concentrations showed an increasing pattern from SIRS to severe sepsis and septic shock.REFERENCE(S). 1.

Potentially effective therapeutic interventions for acute Kidney Injury (AKI) are currently delayed due to paucity of early predictive biomarkers. The RIFLE criteria allow assessing the degree of renal dysfunction. We evaluated whether Cystatin C (Cys C) is an early predictive biomarker for AKI in a heterogenous population in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We also assessed the correlation of Cys C with the need for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) and the outcome (death) of critically ill patients (pts).METHODS. Upon admission in the ICU, initial severity illness scores were calculated and the values of serum CysC and serum creatinine(Cre) were determined for up to 30 days. Pts were scored daily for the presence of AKI using Cre and urine output criteria of the RIFFLE system. AKI was diagnosed by having any of the R, I or F RIFLE criteria.RESULTS.We studied 58 critically ill pts with APACHE score [13 (males 67%, mean age 62.6 \u00b1 18.7 years), admitted in the multidisciplinary ICU of Hospital ''Evangelismos''. Of those patients, 40% developed AKI, 33% needed RRT and 53% died. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an independent association between CysC_max (maximum value of CysC during pts ICU stay) and the need for continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) (OR = 3.77, p \\ 0.006), after controlling for possible confounding factors [gender, age, Apache II and maximum value of Cre during pts ICU stay (Cre_max)]. Furthermore, ROC curve analysis showed that CysC_max is superior in predicting pts who will need RRT compared with Cre_max (AUCs: 0.87, p \\ 0.001 vs. 0.82, p \\ 0.001, respectively). Cox regression proportional hazards analysis revealed an independent association between CysC_1 (CysC the day of ICU admission) and AKI (regardless of stage according to RIFFLE criteria) (HR = 2.27, p \\ 0.028), after adjusting for possible confounding factors [gender, age, Apache II and Cre the day of ICU admission (Cre_1)]. A ROC curve analysis on the day the patients developed the early stage of AKI (R according to RIFFLE criteria) indicated a significant overall predictive ability for CysC (AUC = 0.82, p \\ 0.004). A CysC cut-off value of 1.64 predicted the early stage of AKI with a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.70.",

Doppler-based renal resistive index has been proposed as a mean to monitor renal perfusion. However, several factors influence renal resistive index including renal resistances, renal vascular compliance, or interstitial renal pressure. This may explain discrepancies regarding interest of RI in renal perfusion assessment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in renal resistive index (RI) after a fluid challenge in critically ill patients.PATIENTS AND METHODS. Prospective, multicenter, study performed on patients requiring a fluid challenge. Patients were included if under mechanical ventilation and monitored by an oesophageal Doppler. Doppler based RI was monitored before and after fluid challenge (Isotonic saline: 500 mL). Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in stroke volume of more than 15%. Acute kidney injury was defined accordingly to the AKIN definition. Results are reported as median[IQR].RESULTS. 19 patients of 67 [39-78] years were included. Main reason for ICU admission was septic shock in every of the included patients. At inclusion median SOFA score was of 11 [7-14]. At study inclusion, ten patients had an acute kidney injury and 16 received vasopressors.Of the included patients, ten (53%) were considered as having fluid responsiveness accordingly to our definition. Median resistive index before and after fluid challenge was of 0Main results are reported in theTable 1. Overall, changes in RI were not different in patients with and without fluid responsiveness.TABLE 1 MAIN PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES BEFORE (T0) AND AFTER FLUID CHALLENGE (T1)Interestingly, RI changes were not correlated with stroke volume in patients with or without fluid responsiveness (R = 0.48; P = 0.20 and R = 0.42; P = 0.27 respectively).CONCLUSION.Our preliminary results suggest that fluid challenge has little impact on renal resistive index. In addition, our results suggest that in critically ill patients, stroke volume has no statistical no clinically relevant impact on renal resistive index. Interestingly, this remains true for the subgroup of patients responding to fluid challenge. Additional patient are currently being included in this study in way to confirm these results and to adjust for confounding factors.COMPARISON OF IODIXANOL AND IOHEXOL FOR THE PREVENTION OF CONTRAST-INDUCED NEPHROPATHYR.

Serum creatinine was found from hospital records but search for baseline values of serum creatinine was also conducted in other laboratories and health care facilities in the country. The severity of acute kidney injury was estimated by the RIFLE classification.RESULTS. 1026 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care units at LSH during the year 2007 (mean age 60.6 \u00b1 17.8 year, 61.1% males). A reliable baseline serum creatinine value was found at LSH for 71% of patients but by extending the search we identified a baseline value in over 99% of the patients. According to RIFLE classification 231 (22.5%) had acute kidney injury, 83 risk, 70 injury and 78 failure. However, if baseline creatinine was calculated in the 29% of patients that did not have a baseline value at LSH, as practiced in previous studies, additional 58 patients were diagnosed with AKI leading to a falsely higher incidence of 28.1%. Mean age of patients with AKI was 67 compared to 58 by those who did not develop AKI (p \\ 0.001). Hospital mortality of patients with AKI was four times higher (40.7%) than of those who did not develop AKI (9.1%).CONCLUSIONS. The incidence of AKI in intensive care units of LSH is about 22.5%, which is lower than reported in recent studies. The incidence presented in this study is, however, in 99% of cases based on true baseline data on kidney function, while in previous studies using the RIFLE classification kidney function was estimated from a calculated creatinine value in a sizeable proportion of patients, possibly resulting in overestimation of the incidence of AKI.ENERGY EXPENDITURE IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PREDICTIVE EQUATIONS AND INDIRECT CALORIMETRYE.A.

Careful determination of the energy requirements should be part of the first care applied to critically ill patients since the metabolic changes provoked by acute disease make nutritional evaluation a difficult clinical exercise. OBJECTIVES. The aim of this investigation was to compare the resting energy expenditure (EE) calculated by Harris-Benedict equation (EE HB ) with the resting EE measured by indirect calorimetry (EE IC ) in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation. Three sources of body weight were used to calculate the EE HB , including: BW1 = portable scale measured, BW2 = Ideal body weight calculation = Male: 22.5 9 Height 2 , Female: 21.5 9 Height 2 and BW3 = Predicted Body Weight Calculation = Male: 50 + 0.91 (height [cm] 152.4), Female: 45.5 + 0.91(height [cm] 152.4).METHODS. One-hundred fourteen patients were included in this investigation. Energy expenditure was calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation (EE HB ) and measured by indirect calorimetry (EE IC ). Indirect calorimetry was performed during 30 min. Energy expenditure also was performed through Harris Benedict equation using real body weight and ideal body weight.RESULTS.Resting energy expenditure calculated with the Harris-Benedict equation using the BW1 showed a significant (\\0.0001) but low relative correlation (r = 0.58) with EE IC , with a mean bias of 26.1 kcal day -1 and the limits of agreement ranging from -605.6 to 553.3 kcal day -1 as detected by the Bland-Altman analysis. The use of BW2 and BW3 yielded worse correlation indexes with EE IC (r = 0.34, p \\ 0.0001; r = 0.35, p \\ 0.0001, respectively) with Bland-Altman analysis showing worse level of agreement and higher variability as compared to EE IC (mean bias of 136.7 kcal day -1, limits of agreement = -816 to 542.5 kcal day -1; mean bias of 135.5 kcal day -1, limits of agreement = -825 to 554 kcal day -1 , respectively).CONCLUSIONS. These findings suggest that REE IC seems to be more appropriate than EE HB to accurate measure of EE in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation. Moreover, the alternative methods to calculate the ideal body weight (BW2 and BW3) yielded decreased accuracy of the EE in critically ill patients.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

Zn 2+ -deficiency is linked to inflammatory processes mediated by reactive oxygen species that are increased in those lacking circumstances. Measurement and monitoring of Zn 2+ is important to prevent the development of serious and potentially fatal complications in critically ill patients OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to define the status of Zn 2+ in plasma and erythrocytes at admission and 7 days of ICU stay in critically ill patients, and to evaluate its relationship with another antioxidant biomarkers as Mg 2+ and superoxide dismutase (SOD).METHODS.A prospective study was done on 54 critically ill consecutive patients with inclusion criteria: C18 years old, SIRS and APACHE II [ 15. Zn 2+ and Mg 2+ were measured by flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) in wet-mineralized samples of erythrocyte. Mg 2+ -and Zn 2+ -content in administered nutrition was recorded daily during the 7 days of studied stay, and %RDIs were obtained. SOD activity was measured by spectrophotometry with an enzymatic method in erythrocytes. Permission was obtained from an institutional ethical committee and written informed consent was asked.RESULTS. At admission 36.5 and 30.6% of patients were deficient in erythrocyte Zn 2+ -and Mg 2+ -, respectively, increasing to 49 and 41.2% at seventh day of ICU stay. There were significant differences between initial and final levels (p \\ 0.05, in both elements). A significant correlation was found between Zn 2+ -administered by nutritional (PE and/or E) treatment (94% below RDIs) and erythrocyte Zn 2+ -content (p \\ 0.05) at seventh day, and erythrocyte Zn 2+ -level is positively associated with erythrocyte Mg 2+ -level content (p \\ 0.02) and SOD activity (p \\ 0.05) of critically ill patients.CONCLUSIONS. Adequate intake of Mg 2+ -and Zn 2+ -, and Mg 2+ -and Zn 2+ -levels in erythrocyte are needed to be monitored at admission and during ICU stay of patients and may have prognostic, and perhaps therapeutic, implications. Development of Mg 2+ -and Zn 2+deficiencies during an ICU stay may be associated with different metabolic and clinical alterations that are attributed to other causes or are unknown, but complicate evolution of critically ill patient.ANAEMIA DOES NOT AFFECT PHYSICAL QUALITY OF LIFE, ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING OR ACTUAL PHYSICAL FUNCTION DURING MEDIUM TERM RECOVERY FROM CRITICAL ILLNESS A.P.

Hu 2 , D.E. Schwartz 2 , R. Minshall 1,2  1  University of Illinois at Chicago, Pharmacology, Chicago, USA,2  University of Illinois at Chicago, Anesthesiology, Chicago, USA INTRODUCTION. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) extravasation is a critical component of the host defense mechanism that can also result in oxidative tissue injury. This process first requires PMN adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs) and then subsequent transendothelial migration (TEM) from the vasculature. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the EC surface is required for firm adhesion of PMNs. The interaction of beta2 integrins on PMNs with ICAM-1 on the EC surface induces ICAM-1 clustering and activation, and then subsequent outside-in signaling is thought to facilitate neutrophil transmigration. ICAM-1 activation is known to increase Src kinase activity as well as NO production in ECs. However, the mechanism by which PMN binding triggers ICAM-1-dependent Src and eNOS activation as well as their role in neutrophil TEM is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that ICAM-1 activation of Src signaling and subsequent stimulation of eNOS-derived NO production is required for PMN extravasation during acute inflammation. METHODS. The in vivo model of carrageenan-induced acute lung inflammation in wild-type (WT), ICAM-1 -/-, and eNOS -/mice was used in parallel with in vitro endothelial cell culture studies to assess ICAM-1-dependent signaling mechanisms that mediate PMN infiltration during acute lung inflammation. RESULTS. Carrageenan-induced PMN infiltration into the lung and activation of Src and eNOS were significantly reduced in ICAM-1 -/mice. In HUVECs expressing native mouse ICAM-1 or phospho-defective Tyr 518 Phe ICAM-1 mutant, we observed that ICAM-1 activation via Ab cross-linking increased Src activity and NO production in a manner dependent on Tyr 518 ICAM-1 phosphorylation. Phosphatase-dead SHP2 mutant (Cys 463 Ser) blocked ICAM-1 cross-linking induced Src activation, and thus SHP2 recruitment to activated ICAM-1 may play an important role in sustaining Src activity by dephosphorylating Src negative regulatory Tyr 529 . In addition, ICAM-1 cross-linking promoted the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 and eNOS at Ser 1177 leading to sustained NO production. Both Akt and eNOS phosphorylation and resultant NO production were sensitive to Src inhibitor PP2 and PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, suggesting ICAM-1 activation stimulates the Src-PI3 K-Akt-eNOS pathway in endothelial cells. In vitro, PMN transmigration was dependent on ICAM-1 phosphorylation and NO production. Consistent with this, in the in vivo model of carrageenan-induced acute inflammation we observed that PMN infiltration into the lung was significantly reduced in eNOS -/mice. CONCLUSIONS: Acute inflammation or ICAM-1 cross-linking in vitro results in Srcdependent ICAM-1 phosphorylation, sustained endothelial cell Src signaling, and eNOSderived NO production which play critical roles in mediating neutrophil extravasation and infiltration in the lung.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

NOS produces NO and citrulline (CIT) from arginine (ARG). Metabolic pathways of ARG-NO metabolism in human sepsis are characterized by a decreased ARG de novo synthesis and increased ARG breakdown by arginase. Previous experimental studies with acute bolus injection of endotoxin did not result in decreased ARG de novo synthesis, indicating this to be an inappropriate model to study human metabolic ARG-NO disorders in sepsis. Therefore, there is a need to develop a prolonged endotoxin infusion model to study these disturbances which underly endothelial dysfunction.OBJECTIVES. To develop a model of prolonged LPS administration in mice to assess the LPS induced changes in NO release, microcirculation, glycocalyx degradation and endothelial dysfunction.METHODS. Mice received a continuous intravenous endotoxin (LPS, 200 lg total) or sterile saline infusion for 18 h. Intracellular NO levels were determined by in vivo NO spin trapping (30 min) with Fe-DETC complexes. After NO trapping, the animals were sacrificed, arterial blood sampled and tissues snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The trapping yield of the nitrosyl-Fe 2+ -DETC complex (MNIC) in tissues was quantified at 77 K. Amino-acid concentrations in plasma were measured by HPLC.

Massive drug ingestions may be associated with refractory cardiac failure, the reversal of which despite prolonged arrest makes extracorporeal life support (ECLS) look promising (grade C recommendation, based on case reports). Once implemented, the purpose of ECLS is to take over heart function until recovery can occur, thus minimizing myocardial work and improving organ perfusion. ECLS is feasible in the intensive care unit (ICU) (1). OBJECTIVES. Our objective was to determine the prognostic factors of ECLS-treated patients METHODS. Prospective study including all poisoned patients treated with ECLS in 2003-2007; surgical cannulation of femoral vessels in ICU to perform ECLS (Rotaflow \u00d2 , Jostra-Maquet SA) in collaboration with a cardio-surgical team of a neighboring hospital; descriptive analysis (median [percentiles 10-90%]); univariate comparisons using Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS. Fifty-seven poisoned patients (19 M/38F, 41 years [21-59], SAPS II: 75 [49-94]) were treated with ECLS over a 4-year period in relation to cardiac failure (26/57) and arrest (31/57).

The aim of this study was to measure the level of PTSD among Hungarian ambulance workers, and explore factors which can influence it.SAMPLE AND METHODS. 411 Hungarian ambulance workers were involved to this crosssectional study (147 ambulance drivers, 173 ambulance nurses, and 91 ambulance team leaders: medical doctors and ambulance officers). Self filling questionnaire were used for data collection, including Briere's Trauma Symptom Checklist, and socio-demographic questions. Chi square test, independent T test and variance analysis were used for comparison of variables.RESULTS. The average PTSD-points of ambulance workers was 20. There was significant association between level of PTSD and gender: women's average 23, men's average 18 PTSD-points (p = 0.049). There were no correlations between level of PTSD and type of settlement, location of ambulance station and level of education. Those who would need psychological support (p = 0.01), and those who had psychologically traumatic experiences in the last 2 years have significantly higher PTSD-points (p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS. Hungarian ambulance workers are exposed with many effects which can lead PTSD. Professional psychological support is needed in order to cope with PTSD successfully.The results were presented and discussed in our weekly meeting on patient safety and healthcare for all ICU personnel. By the end of this year all the recommendations will be implemented in our ICU.CONCLUSIONS. We improved the safety and quality of in hospital transportation of ICU patients by performing a prospective risk analysis. Bow-tie is a good instrument to identify health care risks. ",

A normal neurography of both right and left phrenic nerves at the moment of their admission was the main inclusion criteria. After this baseline study, a new neurography was repeated weekly (Chen and Resman method, Sinergy Medelec), during their stay and at the moment of being discharge from ICU. Simultaneously, all vascular subclavian and internal jugular vein catheterization were registered. A final neurography and a fluoroscopy study were performed after being discharged from hospital. RESULTS. 40 patients were included and two hundred and ten neurographies of both right and left phrenic nerves were performed. 14 patients did not receive any vascular punctures in the cervical region during the follow up period, acting as control group. 26 patients underwent a total of 48 vascular catheterization, 43 in subclavian vein (89.6%) and 5 in internal jugular vein (10.4%). A phrenic neuropathy was diagnosed in 4 patients. This represented an incidence of 15% (4/26) of phrenic neuropathy per patient and 8% (4/48) related to subclavian and internal jugular vein catheterization. In relation to patients without phrenic nerve injury who underwent subclavian and internal jugular vein catheterization, patients affected of phrenic neuropathy had longer mechanical ventilation time (33 \u00b1 36 days vs. 19 \u00b1 13, p = 0.3) and longer average stay time in ICU (49.7 \u00b1 35 days vs. 25 \u00b1 14, p = 0.08), although these differences have not statistical significance. We did not find significantly differences related to age (53 \u00b1 9 vs. 55 \u00b1 18, p = 0.2) and APACHE II index (16 \u00b1 3.5 vs. 15.8 \u00b1 5.8, p = 0.4) between both groups (Wilcoxon Two-Sample Test). We performed a control neurography of 2 case patients after being discharged from hospital. We checked the CMAP phrenic nerve reappearance after 3 weeks and 6 months of being diagnosed its neuropathy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. We found an incidence of phrenic neuropathy of 15% per patient and 8% related to subclavian and internal jugular vein catheterization, during the follow-up period. The time of reappearance of phrenic CMAPs after being detected its neuropathy points to a neuroapraxia or partial axonotmesis as pathogenic type of injury.DISCUSSION. Phrenic neuropathy has to be considered in cases of difficult weaning of unclear etiology. The catheterization of subclavian and internal jugular veins should be recommended employing ultrasound support.",

Multicenter prospective observational cohort study. Inclusion criteria: patients admitted to the 79 participant ICUs during the 24-h observation period. During this period, NM and AE detected and reported inside and outside ICU were included. Only outside ICUs were considered when its were the reason for admission. We evaluate the kind of incident, severity and preventability. Data collection studied under the distribution of frequencies.RESULTS. 1,017 patients were included. 1,424 incidents were reported in 591 patients, 943 were NM and 481 AE. Risk: The median risk of NM was 73% versus AE 40%. 22.1 incidents per patient admitted. Incidence rate: the incident rate median was 5.89 per 100 patients per hour ICU stay, the NM of 3.47 per 100 patients per hour ICU stay and that of AE, 2.04 per 100 patients time of stay in ICU. The 66% of the incidents reported have been NM and 34% AE. This incidents causing temporary damage in the 29.50% of occasions and in the 4.28% permanent damage, compromised the patient's life or contributed to death. Classification of incidents (Table 1) .

RESTORE CARDIOVASCULAR PERFORMANCE IN SEVERE LACTIC ACIDOTIC RATS A. Kimmoun 1 , N. Sennoun 1 , N. Ducrocq 1 , B. Levy 1,2 1 INSERM U961, Groupe CHOC, Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France, 2 CHU Nancy Brabois, Intensive Care Unit, Vandoeuvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy, France INTRODUCTION. Lactic acidosis during shock is responsible for myocardial failure, vascular hyporesponsiveness and a decrease in sensitivity to vasopressor agents. Sodium bicarbonate is a proposed treatment to correct acidosis, although with deleterious cardiovascular effects. Indeed, hypocalcemia and hypercapnia, both powerful myocardial depressants, are the main side effects of the administration of this therapy [1] . OBJECTIVES. Already studied in experimental models of isolated lactic acidosis, the cardiovascular effects of sodium bicarbonate administration have never been explored after correction for hypocalcemia and hypercapnia. METHODS. We therefore compared, in a rat model of severe lactic acidosis (pH \\ 7.2, hyperlactatemia[3 mmol/l) induced by a state of controlled hemorrhagic shock, the cardiovascular effects of: (1) standard resuscitation plus administration of sodium bicarbonate with correction for calcemia and PaCO 2 (''ADAPT'' group, n = 5); (2) standard resuscitation plus administration of sodium bicarbonate without correction for PaCO 2 and calcium (''NONADPAT'' group, n = 5);(3) standard resuscitation; (''STAND'' group, n = 5); (4) standard resuscitation plus calcium administration (''CALC'' group, n = 5). Evaluation at steady and shock state, 60 min and 120 min was focused in vivo on arterial gas and myocardial contractility (Emax) by conductance catheter. Ex vivo vasoreactivity was tested on mesenteric arteries (300 lm) by myography. Sodium intakes were equivalent between groups. RESULTS. Our model displayed a profound acidosis from 7.31 to 7.18 \u00b1 0.01 (p = 0.02) and hyperlactatemia from 2.8 \u00b1 0.4 to 9.2 \u00b1 0.6 mmol/l (p \\ 0.01). Emax decreased from 2.5 \u00b1 0.33 to 0.54 \u00b1 0.06 mmHg/ll p = 0.01. In the ADAPT group, at 60 min, pH was normalized at 7.36 \u00b1 0.01 (p = 0.04). Furthermore, Emax was enhanced at 332 \u00b1 43% (p \\ 0.001) (STAND: 145 \u00b1 26%, NONADAPT: 94 \u00b1 18%, CALC: 234 \u00b1 52%). The cumulative dose of infused norepinephrine was significantly lower in the ADAPT group 145 \u00b1 26 lg/kg compared to other groups (STAND: 344 \u00b1 10 lg/kg, NONADAPT: 438 \u00b1 10 lg/kg, CALC: 423 \u00b1 103 lg/kg, p = 0.02). Ex vivo mesenteric vasoreactivity in the ADAPT group was normalized (graph 1).Mesenteric vasoreactivity to phenylephrine CONCLUSIONS. In severe lactic acidosis, infusion of sodium bicarbonate after correction of its side effects improves myocardial function and vasoreactivity. [1] . The prevalence and significance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency in the intensive care unit have not been fully determined. A recent study of an unselected group of ITU patients [2] has suggested low ITU admission 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are common. OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESES TO BE TESTED. Royal Free Hospital Intensive Care Unit patients exhibit low circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D decrease further during the course of hospital admission. Admission circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D affect ITU morbidity and mortality METHODS. All ITU admissions were assessed within 72 h of presentation and patients who were deemed to have the potential to require admission for at least 1 week were included. Demographic and clinical data were obtained in a prospective manner. Results were recorded from samples obtained at admission, 7 days and 28 days. Standard ITU nutrition protocols were used. No interventions were performed. RESULTS. Clinical and outcome data were obtained for 40 patients. No significant differences between APACHE 2, SAPS 2 or APACHE 3 scores for survivor and non-survivor groups at either ITU or Hospital discharge were noted. 60 further patients await complete data analysis. 0% (0 of 39 for whom results were available) achieved an adequate ([75 nmol/l) circulating 25hydroxyvitamin D level. 3 patients (7.7%) demonstrated levels within the insufficient range (50-75 nmol/l). 2 patients (5.1%) did not have any detectable 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The remaining 34 patients (87.2%) were either in the deficient (41.0%, 25-50 nmol/l) or severely deficient (46.2%, 10-25 nmol/l) ranges. Admission 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in survivors and non-survivors were compared at ITU and Hospital discharge. No significant differences between the four groups (P [ 0.05, ANOVA) were observed, indicating that in this data set, admission 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels do not appear to alter or determine clinical course. Mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were compared at admission, Day 7 and at Day 28. No significant differences between the three groups (P [ 0.05, ANOVA) were identified. No significant differences between the mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of the survivors and non-survivors at Day 7 or Day 28 were apparent (small numbers). ADMISSION [1, 2] and patients undergoing surgical procedures [3] . Patients with neurological illness can receive significant quantities of NS, chosen primarily for its iso-osmolar properties. OBJECTIVES. NS is commonly used as maintenance and resuscitation fluid by the anaesthetist, and as intravascular flushes by the radiologist during prolonged interventional neuroradiological (INR) procedures. This pilot feasibility study aimed to ascertain the effect of NS infusion on acid-base measurements in patients undergoing INR procedures under propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia. METHODS. We collated routine electrolyte, albumin and acid-base data of 5 patients who underwent coil/glue embolisations of intracranial aneurysms and vascular malformations, both before and after the procedure. Base excess (BE) was partitioned into the effects of sodium chloride difference (Na-Cl), albumin, lactate and unmeasured anions (UMA), using the Stewart-Fencl-Story approach [4] . All values are reported as medians (ranges OBJECTIVES.

The administration of rHuEPO to critically ill anaemic septic patients is effective in raising their reticulocytic counts, Hb concentrations and in reducing the total number of units of RBCs they require. In addition there was a trend toward better in hospital clinical course, increased recovery and decreased mortality in the rHuEPO group.CONCLUSIONS. Anaemia is common following critical illness but does not appear to affect the physical aspects of recovery during medium term rehabilitation. This may be due to an overwhelming degree of symptom burden from other complications of critical illness impairing physical function to such a degree that the effects of anaemia are negligible in the medium term. Although decreases in number and function has mainly been described in skeletal muscle, also other organs seem to be affected and it has been hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction might be involved in the development of organ failure.",

After sacrificing 6-8 week old Sprague-Dawley rats, mitochondria from soleus muscle were isolated through homogenization and a series of centrifugations. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring of oxygen consumption, using an oxygraph containing a Clarke-electrode, after addition of ADP. Before these measurements, mitochondria were incubated with plasma from septic patients or healthy volunteers, respectively, for 30 min. In our second series, the mitochondria were incubated with different concentrations of IL-6, TNF-a or buffer. Respiration rates were measured in the presence of ADP (state 3; a measure for the oxidative capacity to produce ATP) and without the presence of ADP (state 4; a measure for the amount of uncoupling). Respiratory control ratio (RCR; a measure for the respiratory efficiency of the mitochondria) was calculated by dividing state 3 by state 4 activity. All measurements were related to citrate synthase activity to compensate for the amount of mitochondria. Statistical differences between the groups were analyzed using a Student's t test.RESULTS. ADP dependent (state 3) respiration was 98% higher and RCR 165% higher in the mitochondria incubated with plasma from the septic patients compared to those incubated with plasma from healthy volunteers (Table) .

These preliminary data suggest that nicotine attenuates both the activation and adhesion of human neutrophils exposed to human septic plasma, but does not affect viability. OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of lag between sepsis initiation and start of treatment on mitochondrial respiration. METHODS. 24 animals [40.1 \u00b1 4.1 kg] were randomized (n = 6/group) to a control group (Group I) and three groups resuscitated at 6 (Group II), 12 (Group III), and 24 (Group IV) hours, respectively, after fecal peritonitis induction. Fecal peritonitis was induced with instillation of 2.0 g/kg of autologous feces via intra-peritoneal drain. Resuscitation was performed according to the SSC and ESICM sepsis guidelines for 48 h. Respiration of permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers and their isolated mitochondria was assessed at baseline and after 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, when applicable, or before death occurred, if earlier. At the end of the experiment, also isolated brain, hepatic and myocardial mitochondrial respiration was measured using high resolution respirometry (Oxygraph-2 k, Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). RESULTS. Mortality (33%, each) and organ dysfunction was highest in groups III and IV. In these two groups, different pattern of changes of skeletal muscle mitochondrial complex I-dependent respiratory control ratio (RCR) were observed (Table 1) . No significant differences between groups were observed for complex I-and II-dependent RCR values of hepatic, myocardial and brain mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 1 ). There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the complexes in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers mitochondrial respiration (data not shown). CONCLUSIONS. Despite the high mortality observed in groups resuscitated at later time points after induction of sepsis, end organ mitochondrial function assessed using physiological substrates was preserved. Despite significant changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration efficiency in the two groups with the highest mortality, our findings do not support the view that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in the pathogenesis of multiorgan dysfunction in experimental sepsis.

Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ which produces signalling proteins involved in inflammation and glucose homeostasis [1] . One of these proteins, adiponectin, promotes glucose utilisation and fatty acid oxidation and thus improves insulin sensitivity via its two receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 [2] . Adiponectin expression has been shown to be reduced in type II diabetes, obesity and endotoxaemia [2, 3] . Adiponectin also exhibits antiinflammatory properties [4] . In this study, we have examined whether adiponectin and its receptor gene expression changes in murine adipocytes stimulated by LPS. METHODS. 3T3--L1 adipocytes were grown in culture media (DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum) until confluent. Pre adipocytes were differentiated with the addition of 10 mg/ml insulin, 1 mM dexamethasone and 100 mM IBMX. Media was changed every 48 h. Cells were treated on day 12 with 100 ng/ml, 1 or 10 mcg/ml LPS (Escherichia coli, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were harvested at 4 and 24 h. mRNA levels were determined by RT PCR in a 12.5 ll reaction volume consisting of 12.5 ng of reverse transcribed cDNA mixed with optimal concentrations of primers and probe and qPCR TM Core kit (Eurogentec, UK) in 96-well plates on a Mx3005P detector. RESULTS. Cell response to LPS was confirmed using IL6 as a reference gene. Expression of adiponectin mRNA was significantly reduced in cells treated with 10 lg/ml LPS harvested at 4 h (7.1 fold p = 0.002). There were no changes in cells treated with lower concentrations of LPS. There were no changes at 24 h. R1 gene expression was significantly reduced following treatment with 100 ng/ml LPS at 4 h (1.5 fold p = 0.04), but treatment with higher concentrations did not change expression. There were no changes at 24 h. R2 expression levels were significantly reduced at 4 h in the 1 and the 10 mcg/ml groups (2.6 fold p = 0.02 and 4 fold p = 0.01) respectively. There were no changes at 24 h. DISCUSSION. Our results add to the evidence that changes occur in the adiponectin system during inflammation. In this model, we observed rapid reduction (at 4 h) in adiponectin at high dose LPS, R1 at low dose LPS and R2 at medium and high doses. There were no changes in expression levels at 24 h. This suggests that a rapid change in the adiponectin system may occur in response to LPS but this change is not maintained at 24 h. In a previous study, our group has shown reduced adiponectin gene expression in adipose tissue depots in LPS induced endotoxaemia [3] . It is interesting that different concentrations of LPS induce different changes within the adiponectin system. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether reductions in both adiponectin and its receptor may contribute to the inflammatory changes and hyperglycaemia commonly observed during sepsis including all CO poisoned patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Following parameters were seized: age, sex, date of admission, SOFA, the source of the intoxication, the gravity CO score, the initial clinical examination (realized by first aid), biology, the rate of HbCO, the Murray score and the rate of complication.",

Among the 405 patients 29% were poisoned by smoke (S group), 60% by pure CO (C group) and 11% by exhaust fumes. More than 30% of the exhaust fumes victims were suicide origin. This characteristic is associated with neurological impairment induce by ingested drugs. Then, their neurological status is impossible to link to the CO poisoning. We have therefore decided to exclude this group. The SOFA score was higher in the S group compared with the C group (0.38-2.17; p \\ 0.0001). A CO score equal to 4 was present in 33 versus 1% respectively in S versus C group (p \\ 0.001). In the under group of patients having a CO score at 3, 0% (0/101) of CO poisoned patients versus 18.4% (7/38) of smoke poisoned patients were ventilated (p \\ 0.001). These patients were intubated either during transport or in the intensive care and none of them received hydroxycobalamine during the first aid (before intubation). The laboratory data showed in the S group a higher lactates level (2.2 vs. 3.9 mmol/l; p = 0.005) and lower initial PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio (365 vs. 306; p = 0.002). Nine percent of the S group present a Murray score at 4 versus 0% for C group (p \\ 0.0001). Pneumonia, shock and death were significantly more frequent in the S group (respectively 8.6 vs. 0.8%, p \\ 0.0005; 11.2 vs. 0.8%, p \\ 0.0001; and 17.9 vs. 1.2%, p \\ 0.0001)CONCLUSIONS. As expected the smoke poisoned group has a higher mortality than pure CO group (mortality 17% vs. overall mortality 5.9%). At equivalent CO gravity score, mortality and complications are always more frequent in the smoke poisoned group. The smoke poisoned group has a high risk of degradation. Those patients require specific monitoring and support and probably early administration of hydroxycobalamine. HYPOTHESIS.

Citalopram IP-MLD was determined as 102 mg/kg in rats. Seizures were significantly increased in rats receiving 80 and 120% of citalopram MLD versus controls (p \\ 0.01 and p \\ 0.05, respectively), while death rate was only significantly increased in rats treated with 120% of citalopram MLD (p \\ 0.001). Significant decrease in body temperature was observed after 90 min in rats treated with doses[60% MLD in comparison to controls (p \\ 0.05). Occurrence of serotonin behavioural syndrome was comparable in all groups. Citalopram administration did not result in significant hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and lactate elevation, thus not supporting the hypothesis of the occurence of any significant deleterious cardiovascular effect in citalopraminduced toxicity. However, a significant moderate increase in the inspiratory time (p \\ 0.05) accompanied with an expiratory braking was observed. A significant decrease in platelet serotonin and increase in plasma serotonin concentrations were measured (p \\ 0.05). Pre-treatment with diazepam (1.77 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (17.1 mg/kg) of rats receiving a lethal citalopram dose prevented seizures and death, while propranolol was ineffective.CONCLUSIONS.

(Hydroxy) chloroquine intoxication studies and case reports in English, Dutch or French were evaluated. Patients older than 15 years with severe intoxications, based on measured concentrations or life-threatening symptoms, were included. Pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by means of a Fisher exact test. Our results were compared with two retrospective and one prospective study.RESULTS. There were 32 case reports identified from which 25 case reports met our inclusion criteria. Thirteen patients received diazepam of whom two died, compared to twelve patients who did not get diazepam of whom one died. Statistical analysis demonstrated that treatment with diazepam was not associated with a lower mortality rate (RR: 1.1 CI 0.8-1.5; p = 1.0).Although pooling of case reports is debatable, these results were comparable to the retrospective and prospective studies that didn't show any benefit from diazepam in chloroquine intoxication [2, 3, 4] . The positive effect of diazepam may have been underestimated, due to the fact that it has been given only as rescue therapy.CONCLUSIONS. Based on our analysis there is a lack of evidence concerning any antidotal effect of diazepam. Good supportive treatment is pivotal. If the clinical manifestations of (hydroxy) chloroquine intoxications require sedation or treatment of seizures, diazepam is a good choice based on its pharmacological profile. A prospective study which compares diazepam to sedativa with similar pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile is required to prove that diazepam has any antidotal effect. INTRODUCTION.

Control animals received intraperitoneal saline and imipenem after 6 h. Blood Cytokines and serum lactate were measured. The animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Brain slices of 400 mcm were used to measure oxygen consumption and glucose uptake.RESULTS. Interleukin 6, MIP 1a and Interleukin 1b significantly raised in the first 6 h after sepsis induction (p = 0.001; p = 0.0017; p = 0.0001 respectively). In 24 h only MIP 1a was significant higher (p = 0.0001). Lactate was elevated 6 and 24 h after sepsis induction (p \\ 0.01 and p \\ 0.001 respectively). Oxygen consumption increased after 6 h of sepsis and drops under control values 24 h after the induction of sepsis. Glucose uptake, measured by the NBDG fluorescence, was higher after 6 h (p = 0.0475) and 24 h after sepsis induction.CONCLUSION. In a murine model of abdominal sepsis, inflammatory markers, lactate production, and brain glucose uptake increased and were parallel to alterations in the mitochondrial oxygen metabolism. INTRODUCTION. The Royal Bournemouth Hospital has one of the highest out-of-hospital cardiac arrest admission rates in the UK. In 2005, following ILCOR/AHA guidelines [1] , a cooling protocol was developed for patients with return of spontaneous circulation after advanced life support for ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. In preparation for potential new ILCOR/AHA guidelines in 2010, the prospective database of outcomes for these patients was analysed.OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the outcomes of therapeutic hypothermia for patients with return of spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest.",

            "text": "Outcome data from our prospective registry of cooled patients are summarised.RESULTS. Sixty-three patients were cooled in 4 years (median age 68 years; mode 76; range 19-88 years). 84% survived to ITU discharge and 70% to hospital discharge. 98% of these were discharged home (14% to a rehabilitation hospital before home and one patient to a long term care facility). Ninety-five percent of survivors were alive at 6 months and 80% alive at 1 year with seven status results still pending. Median ITU length of stay was 3.5 days (range 1-13). Six patients required temporary percutaneous tracheostomies for airway protection and weaning from ventilation. Median duration from ITU to hospital discharge was 16 days (range 0-62).CONCLUSIONS. This series is large by comparison to other UK centres. Survival to hospital discharge, at 6 months and 1 year were better than other published results. Although neurological outcomes were not formally assessed, we believe that the capacity to discharge home is a desirable patient outcome and represents the beneficial neurological effect of our cooling protocol. Selection bias will have undoubtedly affected our results. However the age of our patients was higher than in published trials and in other reports is considered an adverse outcome predictor. Our data would not support restricting induced hypothermia on the basis of age alone. We consider the ITU and hospital lengths of stay required to discharge these patients to be long. These data were not reported in original trials. Discharges may obviously be delayed for non-clinical reasons. This aside, neurological recovery progresses for months after cardiac arrest and discharge home may still prove possible if time is allowed. However, post-ITU resource implications should be considered when introducing a cooling protocol. INTRODUCTION. Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) is the third largest cause of mortality and the leading cause of chronic disability in the industrialized world. In some parts of Europe and the United States 26-43% of patients with AIS may be admitted to a neurological intensive care unit (ICU) for supportive therapy with 8-10% receiving mechanical ventilation [1, 2] . There are currently no agreed UK criteria for the admission of AIS patients to critical care.OBJECTIVES. To review the incidence and outcome of AIS in our tertiary ICU over the last five years.",

Demographic and outcome data were recorded and compared against a mean value of all ICU admissions.RESULTS. AIS comprised 0.8% of ICU admissions during the study period. Demographic data is presented in Table 1 as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median (interquartile range) as appropriate. In 2008 4% (11/272) of hospital AIS admissions were admitted to ICU. 14 patients had surgical procedures including 8 decompressive craniectomies. 27% of survivors had a discharge GCS of 15/15. Mortality for unselected medical admissions over the study period was 36%. There are differences of significance in the mortality according to the age, classified by age groups with an age cut off of 80 years (\\80 years 38.6 vs. C80 years 40%, p \\ 0.01). Apart from the GCS, the rest of the variables analyzed in the ICH score are not of significance; supra and infratentorial, presence of intraventricular blood neither on the divided volume over or under 30 cc although, in the latter, a p \\ 0.1 can be observed and if we only analyze the supraventricular, it comes out as significant. Other analyzed data are the time of the surgery, which is not significant, the need for mechanical ventilation, which is (42.9 vs. 15.8%, p \\ 0.05), and the days of ventilation with a mortality clearly higher on those patients with\\5 days of ventilation (83%) and on those of shorter stay (lesser then 5 days 79%).CONCLUSIONS. Let be remarked that the samples have been taken from patients admitted in the intensive care unit, losing a possible sample of less serious patients, and with a higher level of consciousness, what might explain why supra or infratentorial location and the volume don't come out as forecasting factors, since its likely that there are many small infratentorial outside the intensive care unit. We highlight also that the high mortality in the first few days can be caused by those patients who are admitted as donors, developing an encephalic death in the first days, conditioning also the data regarding the mortality on fewer days with ventilation. The finish up, we have to point out the fact that the presence of previous hypertension during the treatment might be a bad forecasting factor that should be deeper studied. ",

The patients who developed critical illness polyneuromyopathy had significantly inferior muscle strength at their discharge from the ICU. These patients also had lower functional ability. This functional ability remained defected even 8 months after their discharge from the hospital. These initial findings are suggestive that the appearance of critical illness polyneuromyopathy affects the patients mobility after their discharge either from the ICU or from the hospital and persists for several months after ICU discharge. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of this impairment on the quality of life of these patients and also to evaluate therapeutic tools for critical illness polyneuromyopathy. INTRODUCTION. This poster presents a qualitative system dynamics (SD) analysis of the factors which influence the care of acutely unwell ward patients in New Zealand. This systems thinking approach is commonly used in organisational research and offers a way to make sense of complex relationships between variables. This approach has previously been used in health care to demonstrate differences in mental models between policy makers and clinicians (Cavana et al., 1999) . Since the factors which influence the care of acutely unwell ward patients are complex and multi faceted the qualitative SD method becomes an ideal analytic approach (e.g. see Wolstenholme and Coyle, 1983; Senge, 1990; Vennix, 1996; or Maani and Cavana, 2007) .OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to examine the factors which influence the care of acutely unwell ward patients from an organisational perspective. Key objectives were to determine the enablers and barriers to care from a nursing, medical and managerial (at ward and executive level) perspective.METHODS. Using a multiple case study approach in four wards in two New Zealand hospitals, focus groups and one to one interviews were conducted with key stakeholders identified as nurses, doctors and managers. Initial coding of the data generated themes. These themes were then clustered to provide variables which were mapped to generate separate causal loop diagrams (CLDs) for each of the stakeholder groups to provide the basis for analysis. The CLDs were compared for characteristics and world views.",

During the interviews, a semi-structured form was used. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's method of data analysis. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the institution.RESULTS. According to the nurses, nursing in technologically-advanced environment has three stages. These stages constituted three themes of the study: technology shock (first stage), understanding the technology-supported care (second stage), competency in technological environment (last stage). In the first stage, the nurses focus on themselves and technology; perceive the environment as frightening and complex. In the second stage, nurses gain control on technology, feel themselves safe and recognize their responsibility. In the last stage, the nurses experience anxiety related to their accountability. This anxiety may be motivating but also may be wearisome.CONCLUSIONS. The nurses passes through three stages in a technologically-advanced environment. Helping nurses to pass through these three stages appropriately will increase the contribution of technology to the patient care, more utilization of technology by nurses and more job satisfaction.

We randomly recruited 145 adult patients from acute admissions unit and intensive care in an acute district general hospital in England who met the diagnostic criteria for sepsis. For each patient, compliance with sepsis care bundle was obtained from medical notes. The following components of the 6 h sepsis bundle were assessed: Obtaining blood cultures, initiating antibiotic therapy, measuring serum lactate and in the event of septic shock administration of fluid therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Long and unacceptable delays in admission to ICCU were identified despite evidence of significant organ dysfunction in many of these patients. With all bundle elements being met for only 1 patient it is apparent that evidence based endpoints aimed at reducing mortality from severe sepsis are not being met despite all the bundle elements being practically deliverable. Poor compliance with taking blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration and lack of ScvO 2 measurement are areas requiring particular attention. Further work is recommended to identify potential contributing factors to non-compliance. INTRODUCTION. International guidelines recommend that cardiac output measurement is required in addition to arterial pressure monitoring in patients with persistent shock after initial therapy [1] . Nevertheless, these recommendations are not supported by any comparison of arterial pressure and cardiac output for monitoring the effects of the most current treatments like fluid therapy.",

PP and SAP were the best arterial pressure values for detecting the fluidinduced changes in CI. Using the sole PP for assessing fluid responsiveness led to a non negligible proportion of false negative cases. This supports the recommendation that when a precise monitoring of fluid resuscitation is required, like in refractory shock, a direct assessment of cardiac output is required. OBJECTIVES.

INTRODUCTION. The sialic acid content of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane decreases early in sepsis [1] , and this alters the RBC shape and metabolism [2] . An increased ratio of the RBC proteins Band 3/alpha spectrin was observed in a mouse model of septic shock, suggesting a possible alteration of the RBC membrane integral/peripheral proteins ratio [3] .

Anesthesia protocol was standardized with systematic use of tranexamic acid. Three blood samples were harvested: T1 = induction; T2 = 30 min. after cross aorta clamping; T3 = 24 h after induction. The Patrol method was performed after serum exposition to a photosensibilizer agent then to a laser irradiation leading to the formation of free radicals. Oxidation by those free radicals of a fluorometric sensor allowed an indirect measure of TAS. This measurement in arbitrary unit (AU) corresponded to area under curve compared to a control value from a pool serum. A value higher than 1 indicated a lower capacity for the given serum to neutralize free radicals whereas a lower value indicated a higher capacity. The same sample allowed TAS determination (lmol/L) with Randox TM method. Results were expressed as absolute numbers, mean \u00b1 SD. TAS were compared with ANOVA test; p \\ 0.05 was significant.RESULTS. The seven patients (5 male, 2 female; 71 \u00b1 10 years old) enrolled underwent cardiac surgery (4 CB and 3 AVR) without any problem. There was no variation in TAS determination with the Randox TM method: T1: 1.39 \u00b1 0.13; T2: 1.41 \u00b1 0.26; T3: 1.33 \u00b1 0.15 lmol/L.

Oxidative stress due to overwhelming release of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species (RN/OS) is held largely responsible for sepsis-induced organ failure and mortality [2] . Up-front and/or ongoing distortion of the pro-oxidant/anti-oxidant balance is likely to play an important role in this situation and in ischemia-reperfusion. Therefore the Patrol test which appeared to be more sensible than the Randox TM method could a good tool in these cases and for evaluation of new anti-oxidant treatments in critical care medicine. These results have to be confirmed in a larger population. INTRODUCTION. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. Despite attempts to improve standardized strategies in resuscitation and treatment of sepsis, the morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. Early diagnosis and stratification of the severity of sepsis is the key to start timely the appropriate treatment. Sepsis is the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to infection; it can lead to hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction and at the cellular level to aerobic mitochondrial dysfunction. Lactate is the product of anaerobic metabolism and thus may serve as a prognostic factor in this subset of patients.OBJECTIVES. The authors propose to test the association of the first serum lactate at hospital admission with shock and ICU mortality in patients with community-acquired severe sepsis. ",

To our knowledge, however, no study evaluated the microvascular pattern of septic patients with chemotherapy-induced severe leukocytes depletion.OBJECTIVES. To assess early microcirculatory response to sepsis in patients with and without drug-induced neutropenia.METHODS. Demographic and hemodynamic variables together with sublingual microcirculation recording (OPS-SDF videomicroscopy) were collected in four groups of subjects: septic shock (SS, N = 9), septic shock in neutropenic patients (NSS, N = 8), neutropenia without inflammation (NEUTR, N = 7) and healthy controls (CRTL, N = 13). Except for controls, all measurements were repeated after complete resolution of septic shock and/or neutropenia (TP2). Collected video-files were processed using appropriate software tool and semi-quantitatively evaluated (functional capillary density, FCD (cm/cm 2 ); mean flow index, MFI [1] ) [3] . CONCLUSIONS. Microvascular derangements in sepsis did not differ between non-neutropenic and neutropenic patients. Surprisingly, neutropenia per se without measurable systemic inflammation was also associated with alterations of the sublingual microcirculation. Although we cannot exclude the role of residual neutrophils, our data could indicate that leukocytes are not the only and exclusive modulators of septic microvascular dysfunction. In addition, the role and mechanisms of microvascular changes associated with chemotherapyinduced neutropenia warrants further investigation. ",

High Mobility Group Box protein 1 (HMGB-1) is a cytokine that can mediate inflammatory response in different conditions included rheumatoid arthritis, infections, sepsis and septic shock. HMGB-1 released by activated macrophages/monocytes acts as a late mediator of sepsis. Studies have shown that serum HMGB-1 concentrations were elevated in patients with severe sepsis.OBJECTIVES. In the present study, we evaluated the role of the HMGB-1 levels at the time of admission at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as predictor of outcome in patients with sepsis and septic shock.METHODS. Forty-four Patients admitted to the ICU with sepsis and septic shock was recruited. Serum samples were obtained at the time of admission for the determination of HMGB-1 levels. The results were correlated with the origin of sepsis, severity, organ dysfunction, requirements of mechanical ventilation and vasoactives, days at the ICU, comorbidities and mortality at the ICU and 28 days after admission.",

At the NE doses of 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 lg/kg b.w./min, all of the gastric residues were zero (17 patients). The correlation between the NE doses and the gastric rescues was statistically significant (p: 0.01). The mean arterial pressures (MAP) were 84.16 \u00b1 18.01 mmHg (ranges from 58 to 120 mmHg. There was no significantly correlation between MAP and the gastric residues.CONCLUSIONS. The gastric emptying in the septic shock patients was not disturbed by administration of NE. INTRODUCTION. Anemia is a frequently encountered problem on the intensive care unit. Several factor lead to anemia, among which are traumatic blood loss and the drawing of blood for routine laboratory tests. It's not known how this may affect innate immunity. Hepcidin is a central regulator of iron homeostasis. It is induced in response to iron and inflammation and reduced in response to anemia and hypoxia. The suppression of hepcidin leads to the internalization and degradation of the iron exporter ferroportin on intestinal cells and macrophages, leading to the uptake of iron from the gut and the release of iron from the macrophages from the reticulo-endothelial system (RES). These cells are central to the innate immune response and the altered iron status of these cells due to suppression of hepcidin may affect the inflammatory response of these cells. We tested the hypothesis that phlebotomy in human volunteers would lead to a suppression of the innate immune response. This abstract provides data of a pilot study carried out in 3 subjects.",

Three volunteers were subjected to the letting of 400 ml of blood by phlebotomy. Blood for the determination of hemoglobin and iron parameters, leucocyte count and differential, and hepcidin-25 was drawn at day 0, 4 and 7 after phlebotomy. Further whole blood stimulation was carried out at each time point by adding 0.5 ml heparin anticoagulated whole blood to a prepared tube containing endotoxin, pam3cis or RPMI as a control. Final concentrations of LPS and P3C were 10 ng/ml and 1 lg/ml respectively. These tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h and centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 g. The supernatant was frozen at -80 until the measurement of TNF-alfa and IL-6 by ELISA. Cytokine production was corrected for the number of monocytes present. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM.",

There was however a clear decrease in serum ferritin levels from 162 \u00b1 48 at baseline to 109 ? 46 at day 7. Leucocyte count and differentiation did not show any significant changes. Hepcidin was clearly suppressed from 4 to day 7 after phlebotomy (from 6 \u00b1 1 to 2 \u00b1 1). TNF-alfa production dropped from 81 to 47 ng/10 7 monocytes at day 7. IL-6 production dropped from 327 to 195 ng/10 7 monocytes. Hepcidin levels correlated well with cytokine production (r 2 0.53 for TNF-alfa, r 2 0.51 for IL-6).CONCLUSIONS. Phlebotomy leads to suppression of the innate immune response in whole blood. This could be a result of the intracellular decrease of iron in immune cells due to the systemic suppression of hepcidin. These findings are relevant to critical care patients that are subject to the repeated drawing of blood while their immune system is often compromised. INTRODUCTION. Hypothermia and hyperthermia occur in many pathological states presenting to the emergency department. Both these processes are known to significantly impair coagulation pathways but as yet there is little evidence to show what affect they have on the evolving clot structure. Previous studies have attempted to determine the effect of temperature on whole blood coagulation using techniques such as thromboelastometry (TEG) but its ability to provide meaningful outcomes in terms of clot quality and structure remains elusive. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of a new technique, Gel Point (GP) and Fractal Dimension (d f ), as a functional biomarker in haemostasis.",

An oscillatory shear technique [1] using an AR-G2 Instrument (TA Instruments) was applied to each sample. The GP, which indicates the formation of the fibrin network, was obtained for each sample using the Chambon-Winter Gel Point criterion [2] .

Secondly, it also highlighted a significant and meaningful correlation between coagulation pathway change (Time to GP, TGP) and the eventual clot outcome (fractal dimension). The TGP of the incipient clot was prolonged and the corresponding d f decreased with reduced temperature values. Although, the changes in the coagulation pathway of the TEG (R time) and the rheometer (TGP) correlated, the new biomarker, d f , provided additional structural data on the fibrin network formed and highlighted the relationship between coagulation pathway changes and the eventual fibrin clot structure.CONCLUSIONS. In this study, we describe and quantify for the first time how temperature affects the coagulation pathways and how this impacts on the fibrin clot network, morphology and strength by using the new biomarkers, GP and d f . The potential of these new biomarkers in determining the effects of temperature change in critical illness and injury needs to be evaluated clinically.",
