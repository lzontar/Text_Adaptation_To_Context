The world is focussing on several methods to battle against this novel corona virus, including control of its spread. In this context, ARCI has quickly made efforts to develop disinfection systems including a UVC-based disinfection trolley, honeycomb air heater and a fogging chamber using UVC germicidal lamps, dry heat sterilization and HOCl-based chemical disinfectant to provide rapid and effective inactivation of microorganisms causing the pandemic. These systems have been successfully deployed at different hospitals for their validation.",

The experts from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named it as SARS-CoV-2 virus as the receptor-binding gene region has a structure which is similar to that of SARS coronavirus. It has been shown by several research groups that the virus uses the same entry receptor, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hofmann and Pohlmann 2004; Zhou et al. 2020) . The acute respiratory disease which is caused by the present coronavirus is observed to be through transmission via respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected person and also through contaminated surfaces. No vaccine or direct medicine is available for treating the persons infected by this virus and it is expected to take several months for bringing out either a vaccine or medicines for the treatment. Therefore, it is very important to prevent the spread of the virus both in health-care premises and public places. SARS-CoV-2 is shown to be more stable on plastic as well as stainless steel surfaces when compared to copper surfaces (Doremalen 2020) .",

In fact, a report presented on studies performed on students has shown that touching the face with hands on an average is ~ 23 times/h, which may cause a transmission of the virus (2015). Therefore, during a situation of pandemic, it is necessary to minimize the viral load on frequently touched surfaces, especially in the vicinity of patient care rooms as primary importance, where the highest viral load is expected. In addition, with the official and public activities slowly resuming, there is an utmost necessity for quick disinfection methods at the various work places, public transport system and commercial outlets.",

The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also recommended these disinfection methods for bacteria and viruses involving protein denaturation and DNA/RNA disruption (Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities 2008) . Although entire UV radiation is available from Sun, the radiation with UVC is completely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and therefore UVC radiation can be made available only through UVC lamps. The second method uses dry heat with advantages such as nontoxicity and environmental friendliness. Similarly, several biocidal agents such as hydrogen peroxide, HOCl and NaOCl are used as disinfectants worldwide, especially for fogging, with prime importance in health-care facilities (Abreu et al. 2013; Djimeli et al. 2014) .",

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 sustains for a very long time on surfaces, causing rapid spread (Abreu et al. 2013; Djimeli et al. 2014 ). UVC radiation is very well known to inactivate most of the microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungus, algae etc., by forming pyrimidine dimers. The dimerization process disturbs the replication of RNA or DNA, leading to cell destruction (Darnella et al. 2004 ). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the large family of COVs with single-stranded RNA viruses (ssRNA). Although the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown, ssRNA is known to be more sensitive to UVC than double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Tseng and Li 2007) . According to the International Ultraviolet Association (IUVA), UV disinfection technologies can play a major role in reducing the transmission of the virus causing COVID-19 based on existing disinfection data and empirical evidence reported for other viruses (McDevitt et al. 2012) . UVC (200-280 nm) has been extensively studied for its ability to disinfect air, water and surfaces and thus can reduce the risk of acquiring infection, when used with proper care.",

A unique and innovative energy-efficient disinfecting device has been jointly developed and a patent filed (Johnson et al. 2020) by ARCI and M/s.

The device is based on honeycomb-based air heater technology which produces dry/moist heat over a wide range of temperature and relative humidity. The device is portable, lightweight and compact, along with an instant generation of heat for quick disinfection process. A high temperature post heater is also installed in the exhaust line to ensure the disinfection of air from the chamber before letting the air to the atmosphere.

However, the material safety data for several of the virucidal chemicals do not allow their use through spraying or fogging, owing to their toxicity and their adverse effect on humans, causing ill-health depending on the duration of exposure and concentration of the sprays (https ://www.epa.gov/pesti cide-regis trati on/selec ted-epa-regis tered -disin fecta nts). Among theses, sodium hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid are the most popular disinfectants for cleaning surfaces and fogging applications in a hospital environment. However, sodium hypochlorite has some drawbacks including its inactivation in organic matter, corrosive nature to several metals and residue being left on surfaces. It is also not accepted for fogging on human beings since it causes mild to severe irritation to the skin, throat and eyes (Peck et al. 2011) . Therefore, it requires PPE even to the person carrying out the fumigation. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is the most effective chemical against pathogens, while it is 100% safe because it is chemical free, non-toxic and natural (Rahman et al. 2016) . Applications of aqueous solutions containing approximately 30-2500 ppm HOCl extend to a variety of areas including wound care, dental care and as antimicrobial as well as virucidal agent (Park 2007) . HOCl is also used widely for water treatment, food sanitization, hard surface disinfection, oil drilling and in cosmetics. It has been known to be used in the medical field for over a century even before antibiotics were available. HOCl targets bacteria or virus by chemically linking chlorine atoms to nucleotide bases that disrupt the function of bacterial DNA, impede metabolic pathways in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients and release energy and other membrane-associated activities. HOCL can be synthesized through electrolysis of a brine solution by using mixed metal oxide (ruthenium oxide and iridium oxide)coated titanium electrodes and by applying currents in the range of 6-10 A. During the electrolysis process, the brine solution (~ 3.5% NaCl in water) provides the chloride ion (Cl \u2212 ) that is reduced to form chlorine gas. Chlorine gas produced chemically reacts with water to produce HOCl, hydrogen ion (H + ) and chloride ion (Cl \u2212 ) following the reaction below (Hricova and Stephan 1934) .",

The sanitization chambers are installed and demonstrated at ESIC Medical College and Hospital, Hyderabad, to study its efficacy in sanitization of PPEs and humans. The sanitization system consists of three chambers of 1.5 m \u00d7 1.5 m \u00d7 2 m each wherein water is sprayed in first chamber, HOCl of 50-100 ppm concentration shall be sprayed in the second chamber and hot air is blown into the final chamber. The complete design of the chamber including size, material of construction and HOCl concentration are given by ARCI. Simulation studies for the optimization of pressure, nozzle size and number of nozzles are carried by DRDL (Fig. 4) . Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to predict mutliphase flow dynamics using well-proven CFD software for various type and number of injectors (with diameter = 0.2 mm with 0.06 lit per minute mass flow) and their positions on the top and side walls to arrive at an optimal solution so that the whole human body (450 mm diameter and 1700 mm height) is covered with sanitizer in an optimal time. Particle sizes of around 10 \u00b5m with almost negligible velocity are observed near the human body. Fourteen injectors (6 on either side walls and 2 on top wall) are required to fully cover the human body with sanitizer particles of 10 \u03bcm within about 15 s. Testing of sanitization chambers and efficacy of HOCl as a 2H 2 O + 2e \u2212 \u2192 2OH \u2212 + H 2 \u2191, 2Na + + 2OH \u2212 \u2192 2NaOH. disinfectant was carried out by ESIC Medical College and Hospital, Hyderabad. The results indicated that 100 ppm HOCl is able to completely remove bacteria including E. Coli. The most interesting results are the studies performed on SARS-CoV-2, where complete disruption of virus was observed within 30 s.",
