Serological tests to determine TCoV-specifi c antibodies are critical to evaluate previous exposure to TCoV in the turkey fl ocks and differentiate serotypes from different isolates or strains. A specifi c virus neutralization assay using embryonated turkey eggs and immunofl uorescent antibody assay for determining TCoV-specifi c neutralizing antibodies is described in this chapter. Virus neutralization titer of turkey serum from turkeys infected with TCoV is the dilution of serum that can inhibit TCoV infection in 50 % of embryonated turkey eggs. Virus neutralization assay for TCoV is useful to monitor the immune status of turkey fl ocks infected with TCoV for the control of the disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) causes atrophic enteritis in turkeys and belongs to species Avian coronavirus of the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae . The most closely related coronavirus is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causing respiratory disease in chickens. Turkey coronavirus infection induced protective antibody responses because turkeys that survived the infection did not develop clinical signs and TCoV was not detected in their intestines and feces after subsequent exposure to TCoV [ 1 , 2 ] . Therefore, serological tests can be used to detect previous exposure to TCoV and differentiate the serotypes or strains from different isolates. The TCoV-specifi c antibodies can be detected by either enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using TCoV S protein [ 3 , 4 ] , TCoV N protein [ 5 , 6 ] , or IBV virions [ 7 ] or immunofl uorescent antibody ( IFA ) assay using intestine sections containing TCoV [ 8 ] . Among different serological tests, virus neutralization ( VN ) assay is the most specifi c test showing the inhibition of viral infection to target host tissues or cells by protective neutralizing antibodies. Without cell culture system available for TCoV, embryonated turkey eggs are used for VN assay of TCoV. Because TCoV infection usually does not cause embryonic death, IFA assay [ 4 , 8 ] or realtime RT-PCR [ 9 ] is used to detect TCoV in the intestines of turkey embryos to determine whether or not turkey embryos are infected by TCoV. In this chapter, a protocol for VN assay is described for determining the VN titer of serum from turkeys infected with TCoV or receiving experimental vaccines against TCoV infection. In step 1 , TCoV stock and serum to be tested are diluted and incubated for neutralization reaction. In step 2 , the mixture of TCoV and serum is inoculated into embryonated turkey eggs. In step 3 , the infection of TCoV is determined by the detection of TCoV in the intestines of turkey embryos using IFA assay. In step 4 , VN titer, the dilution of serum that can inhibit TCoV infection in 50 % of inoculated embryonated turkey eggs, is calculated according to the results of IFA assay [ 4 , 10 ] . 4. Take eggs to a darkroom because this procedure requires illumination of the egg with an egg candling device while being inoculated. 5 .
