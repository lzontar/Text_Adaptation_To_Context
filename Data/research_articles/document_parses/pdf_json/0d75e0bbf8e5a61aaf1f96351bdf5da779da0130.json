In order to be able to bring horse lottery options into the fold, I pay special attention to the case where these linear spaces do not include all 'constant' options. I consider the frameworks of conservative inference associated with Archimedean choice models, and also pay quite a lot of attention to representation of general (non-binary) choice models in terms of the simpler, binary ones. The representation theorems proved here provide an axiomatic characterisation of, amongst other choice methods, Levi's E-admissibility and Walley-Sen maximality.",

What are the underlying ideas? A subject is to choose between options u, which are typically uncertain rewards, and which live in a so-called option space V. Her choices are typically represented using a rejection function R or a choice function C. For any finite set A of options, R(A) \u2286 A contains those options that our subject rejects from the option set A, and the remaining options in C(A) = A\\R(A) are the ones that are then still being considered. It is important to note that C(A) is not necessarily a singleton, so this approach allows for indecision. Also, the binary choices are the ones where A has only two elements, and I will not be assuming that these binary choices completely determine the behaviour of R or C on option sets with more than two elements: I will be considering choice behaviour that is not necessarily binary in nature.",

In summary, doing so allows us to deal with options that are gambles [14, 19] , i.e. bounded real-valued maps on some set of possible states X , that are considered as uncertain rewards. These maps constitute a linear space G(X ), closed under point-wise addition and pointwise multiplication with real numbers. But it also brings in, in one fell swoop, vector-valued gambles [15, 23] , polynomial gambles to deal with exchangeability [2, 16] , equivalence classes of gambles to deal with indifference [18] , and abstract gambles defined without an underlying possibility space [21, 22] . In all these cases, the space of options essentially includes all real constants-or constant gambles. But when we want our approach to also be able to deal generically with options that are horse lotteries, it is obvious that we need to consider option spaces that do not include all real constants.",

For a detailed exposition of the motivation for and the interpretation of the choice models discussed below, I refer to earlier joint papers by Jasper De Bock and myself [6, 7] . I also recommend Jasper De Bock's most recent paper on Archimedeanity [5] , as it contains a persuasive motivation for the new Archimedeanity condition, in the more restrictive and concrete context where options are gambles. I introduce binary choice models on abstract option spaces in Sect. 2, and extend the discussion to general-not necessarily binary-choice in Sect. 3. After these introductory sections, I focus on adding Archimedeanity to the picture. The basic representation tools that will turn out to be useful in this more restricted context, namely linear and superlinear bounded real functionals, are discussed in Sect. 4. The classical approach to Archimedeanity [10, 11, 19] for binary choice-which I will call essential Archimedeanity-is given an abstract treatment in Sect. 5. Sections 6 and 7 then deal with the new notion of Archimedeanity in the binary and general case, and discuss conservative inference and the representation of general Archimedean choice models in terms of binary (essentially) Archimedean ones. I conclude in Sect. 8 by stressing the relevance of my findings. Proofs for the results given below can be found in preprint version on arXiv [1] .",

Its foundations are laid by the coherence axioms, which can be made stronger by adding mixingness and Archimedeanity, separately or jointly. For each of the sets of axioms thus formed, we get a conservative inference framework with corresponding closure operators, as well as representation theorems that allow us to construe all coherent, Archimedean or mixing modelsas well as combinations of them-as intersections (infima) of specific types of binary ones. These representations are especially interesting because they lead to a complete axiomatic characterisation of various well-known decision making schemes. To give one example, the (coherent and) Archimedean and mixing models are exactly the ones that correspond to decision making using Levi's E-admissibility scheme [8, 13] associated with general-not necessarily closed or convex-sets of linear previsions. I believe such a characterisation-jointly with the one in Jasper De Bock's paper [5] -is achieved here for the first time in its full generality. And the theory is also flexible enough to allow for characterisations for a plethora of other schemes, amongst which Walley-Sen maximality [13, 19] . Indeed, for the binary choice models we get the decision making schemes based on maximality for sets of desirable gambles (coherent binary models), lexicographic probability orderings (mixing binary models), evenly convex sets of positive superlinear bounded real functionals-lower previsions essentially-(Archimedean binary models), and evenly convex sets of positive linear bounded real functionals-linear previsions essentially-(Archimedean and mixing binary models). And for their more general, non-binary counterparts we get, through our representation theorems, schemes that are based on arbitrary intersectionsinfima-of a whole variety of such binary cases.",

We therefore also need to look for other and more constructive ways of tackling the conservative inference problem; early work on this topic seems to suggest that this is not an entirely hopeless endeavour [7] . On a related note, the Archimedeanity axioms D A , D p A and K A are similarly 'nonconstructive', as they are based on the existence of (super)linear functionals that 'do certain things'.
