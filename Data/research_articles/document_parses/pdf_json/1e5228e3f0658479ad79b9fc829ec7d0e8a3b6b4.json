Research suggests various approaches that use enriched semantic context or external context (from sources like Freebase) to perform KB Canonicalization. In fields where such external sources of context do not exist the problem remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep Siamese architecture with character-based attention and word embeddings that (a) estimates pairwise similarity between all entity mentions, and (b) then uses these similarity (scores) to create canonical clusters representing unique entity in the KB.

This content includes diverse entities from recruitment domain such as company names, institute names, skills, and designations, which are extracted and fed to Knowledge Bases (KBs) maintained by these companies. As this content is user generated, multiple variations of these entities find their way into the KBs. Often a company name or an institute name could have hundreds of variations in the KBs. These name variations lack standard nomenclature or representation, thereby resulting in identical and noisy records for the same entity. For example, KB may have multiple representations named warner bros., warner brothers pictures and warner bros. entertainment inc. for the same real world entity Warner Brothers Studios. Such non-standard representations of named entities when used in applications such as search and recommendations result in sub-optimal information retrieval. Therefore, KB canonicalization i.e, mapping multiple references of same entities into unique clusters is imperative for many applications in the recruitment domain. In this work, we focus on recognizing varied representations of an entity in the KB and group them to form a cluster referring to a unique entity [8, 16, 17] . To canonicalize these varied representations, we address various challenges resulting from previously unseen or out-of-knowledge-base (OOKB) entities, location variations (e.g., Google Singapore vs. Google India or Cal State University Los Angeles vs. Calif.

So research that relies on using Open KBs to help in disambiguation [7, 13] cannot be used for the recruitment domain; (b) Handcrafted features (e.g. lexical, linguistic, and semantic) are limiting as they do not scale to capture the volume of variations.

The proposed Similarity Model (SM) learns the entity pair similarity using Siamese neural networks comprising of Bi-Directional LSTMs with attention on character embeddings. Using word embeddings, we enhanced the capability of the model to capture the semantic similarity. Further, we applied Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) using these pairwise similarities to create clusters of unique entities. In our work, we efficacy of our architecture on both proprietary and public dataset. Experiments revealed that the Siamese neural network-based approach learns a character level relationships and achieves competitive performance relative to the baselines.
