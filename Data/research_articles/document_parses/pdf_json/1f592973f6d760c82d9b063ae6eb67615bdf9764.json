Although the etiologic agent was rapidly identified to be a previously unknown coronavirus (named SARS coronavirus or SARS-CoV) and the outbreak was controlled by public health measures, no specific options were available for prevention and control of human disease. Over the past two years, a number of strategies for vaccines and immunoprophylaxis have been investigated. Animal models are essential for preclinical evaluation of the efficacy of candidate vaccines and antivirals, and they are also needed in order to understand the pathogenesis of SARS. A number of investigators around the world have evaluated several different animal species as models for SARS; this effort is important for two natural reservoir, and second, if the efficacy of vaccines cannot be evaluated in humans, efficacy in two or more animal models may be required for licensure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The ideal animal models would be those in which viral replication is accompanied by clinical illness and pathology that resembles that seen in human cases of SARS. However, the consequences of SARS-CoV infection in different animal models may vary from this picture to one in which viral replication is associated with pathology in the absence of clinical illness or models in which viral replication is present in the absence of clinical illness or histopathologic changes. Models that demonstrate clinical illness and pathology can be used to study the disease process as well as to evaluate intervention strategies while models in which virus replication occurs without clinical illness can be used in vaccine or antiviral studies. In these cases, the efficacy of an intervention can be assessed by quantitative virology with or without accompanying pathology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "A review of the different animal models that have been reported follows with a summary of the pros and cons and potential applications of the different models.

Virus replication occurs without signs of illness such as weight loss or ruffled fur and is associated with minimal to mild inflammation in the lungs. Viral antigen and nucleic acid are present in the epithelial cells of the large airways on day 2 but are being cleared by day 4. 1 When SARS-CoV is administered to BALB/c mice i.n. and orally, viral nucleic acid can be amplified from lung tissue and small intestines. 2 Intranasally administered SARS-CoV also replicates in the lungs of C57BL/6 (B6) mice, with a peak of viral replication on day 3 and clearance of virus by day 9. 3 SARS-CoV infected BALB/c and B6 mice tend to gain less weight than mock-infected mice 2,3 129SvEv mice also support replication of SARS-CoV with a self-limited bronchiolitis that begins with mixed peribronchiolar inflammatory infiltrates, progresses to bronchiolitis with migration of inflammatory cells into surface epithelium and interstitial inflammation in adjacent alveolar septae, that resolves completely over the next 2 weeks. 4 SARS-CoV infected mice develop a SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibody response and are protected from reinfection with SARS-CoV. Antibody alone is sufficient to transfer this protection to na\u00efve mice. 1 Mice with targeted defects in the immune system were evaluated in order to determine which arm of the immune system was responsible for clearance of SARS-CoV in mice. Beige, CD1 -/and RAG1 -/mice replicated and cleared virus with the same kinetics as B6 mice, without overt signs of clinical disease indicating that NK cells, NK-T cells, and T and B lymphocytes are not required for clearance of SARS-CoV from the lungs of mice. 3 In young mice, SARS-CoV induces dramatic upregulation of a subset of inflammatory chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10) and the chemokine receptor CXCR3 without detectable expression of classic proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, p70, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1) and without evoking marked leukocyte infiltration of the lung. Taken together with the observation that beige, CD1 -/and RAG1 -/mice clear SARS-CoV normally, proinflammatory chemokines may coordinate a rapid and highly effective innate antiviral response in the lung. 3 In contrast to young (4 to 6-week-old) BALB/c mice that support replication of SARS-CoV in the absence of clinical illness and pneumonitis, old (13 to 14-month-old) BALB/c mice demonstrate illness (weight loss, hunching, dehydration, and ruffled fur from days 3 to 6 postinfection) and interstitial pneumonitis. 5 Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates noted at day 3 were more prominent by day 5 and evidence of alveolar damage was seen, with multifocal interstitial lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, proteinaceous deposits around alveolar walls and intraalveolar edema. At day 9, the perivascular infiltrates persisted and the changes associated with alveolar damage were accompanied by proliferation of fibroblasts in inflammatory foci. A few of these foci persisted through 29 days post-infection and may represent the histologic correlate of fibrosis and scarring seen by high-resolution computed tomography in patients who recovered from SARS. 5 Mice with a targeted disruption of the STAT 1 signaling pathway develop severe SARS-When 6 to 8-week-old lightly anesthetized BALB/c mice are administered SARS-", "cite_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 390, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 870, "end": 871, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1470, "end": 1471, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1677, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2108, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2669, "end": 2670, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2983, "end": 2984, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 3616, "end": 3617, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SARS-CoV INFECTION IN MICE"}, {"text": "progresses to diffuse interstitial pneumonia with focal airspace consolidation (unpublished 4 infiltrates.
