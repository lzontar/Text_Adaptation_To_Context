Finding from this survey suggest that longawaited restructuring of the educational system as suggested in model curriculum of optometry by Ministry of Health and Family Welfares (MOHFW), India has commenced21,22 . Our 2018 survey showed that the optometry education system was a conventional classroom based system with most teaching and in face to face mode. The Indian teachers and students are habitual to everyday meetings and carrying out teaching-learning activities in a class. Findings of the 2020 survey suggest that more than 90% optometry institutions and educators in India have quickly adapted to E-learning mode.The trend in pedagogy for theoretical content has shifted from monotonous didactic lectures to interactive online lectures using video conferencing tools (e.g. Google meet, Microsoft teams, Zoom etc.); reading and writing assignments are getting done using various teaching learning apps such as Goggle classroom;class-presentations are switched to uploading of pre-recorded presentations on social media platforms.Teachers are using features such as random questioning, use of chat box, opinion polls student lead summarization of the session and more techniques to keep the learner active and engaged during live streamed online sessions. The clinical skills teaching is now not focused only on the psychomotor skills but evidence based practice, critical thinking and clinical decision making skills are also covered using case discussions. The educators are using a wide variety of online tools and apps to keep going with their teaching. Students have also become active learners by contributing to the inputs in the e-learning environment. The rapid transition looks successful in the prima fascia. Work from home culture appears to have settled in optometry educational system prompting 'teach from home' and 'learn from home' strategies. We asked educators about the facilitating and challenging factors of online education.Qualitative thematic analysis of these open ended questions in 2020 survey identified the following facilitating factors, contributing towards the seamless transition of optometry education.Teacher related factors:1. Millennial teachers for the iGeneration of learners-with tech-savvy generations in academia, it is comparatively easy to adapt to the e-learning environment23 . The finding that 70% of teachers arebelow 35 years of age, confirms the contribution of the major ground force for online content development in the success of the quick transformation. However, further subgroup analysis showed that senior faculties were also at par with millennial teachers in adoption with e-learning systems. All the faculties reported high confidence in the use of technology for educational purposes. However, they also reported limited awareness of all technology solutions and their salient features which can be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f used for various educational activities. And therefore, they must be formally trained for efficient usage of various tools and online pedagogy via faculty development programs 24 . 2. Technology at hand: There are challenges in having appropriate high-tech gadgets, computers, or laptops with every student, and even faculty 3 . More often these electronic gadgets with students are shared between the siblings. With the ongoing digital revolution in India, smartphones equipped with a 4G internet connection have reached even in the remotest part of the country 25 . At the same time, the development and availability of a wide variety of tools at our figure tips are assuring the feasibility of getting into online mode 26 . Educators enlisted usage of platforms such as Google classroom, Google meet, MS teams, YouTube, Zoom meetings and many more, which are multi-gadget compatible. A wise choice of multi-screen supported teaching platforms and strategic use of synchronous and asynchronous teaching techniques done by educators accommodated spectrum of devices, operating systems and internet infrastructure benefiting the students, leading to a successful transition of teaching activities to e-learning mode.3. Habitual to web resources: The 2018 survey exposed a dependency on lectures and seminars for delivering knowledge component of the curriculum. PowerPoint presentations, videos and web resources were extensively used by educators even before COVID-19 disruption. Switching to elearning during this lockdown was readily facilitated by these resources.4. Attitude to collaborate: The crisis situation is equally difficult for each of us. We must be able to collaborate for a wide variety of real and virtual resources with us to promote learning in the best possible way18 . Professional attitude, transparency and clarity in communication is the key to effective collaboration. Majority educators believed in collaborative efforts and started the journey for collaboration on an individual basis, without waiting for institutional support or directives. External stakeholders like industry partners, individual practitioners, researchers were also pulled in to contribute directly to academia, which brought in new knowledge and a fresh perspective of looking at optometry education.5.Positive enthusiasm about e-learning: Number of educators reported numerous advantages of elearning environment like the ease of conduct, convenient technique even with limited resources at hand, cost-effective, ability to adapt to the wide learning styles and choices of iGeneration learners, the possibility of innovation and ease of monitoring and documentation of teaching activities. Some of the facilitating factors mentioned by respondents include the time flexibility, the comfort of work from home, and the ability to discharge their duties even in crisis situations adding to their satisfaction level.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": ". Majority of the respondents (89.74%) reported service in optometry institution running either under a hospital setup or as a department in a university. The infrastructure and administration of hospital and university are essentially different, and therefore the priorities, procedures and techniques of academic activities are different. For instance, university educators reported use of E-learning platforms developed by their own university along with other applications, while educators belonging to hospital infrastructure relied mainly upon applications from public domain. The IT support from the institution is also identified as a major factor contributing to the quick and smooth transition to online learning. However, all educators reported high confidence and satisfaction in using online teaching tools, irrespective of type of institution they belong. 10. Contribution from external stakeholders: Social media in India saw a sudden surge of inputs from nationwide optometry /optical associations and industries in the form of webinars, live streaming of panel discussions, which stimulated not only practitioners and faculties but also students to attend more and more webinars and other online educational activities. Strong numbers of live attendees and even more number of subsequent followers ranging from 200 to 4100 unknowingly resulted in positive competitive spirit among academicians, practitioners and subject experts, to conduct good quality sessions 29 . This created a positive momentum of transition from a traditional educational system to a competency-based e-learning system. Many institutions equipped with better infrastructure are contributing to the development of educational modules covering various specialties of optometry practice. Students and practitioners across India are enthusiastically participating in these online sessions, developing a culture of continued education. Positive attitude in the community at large about COVID 19 pandemic-a timely decision of lockdown and sincere efforts by all individuals in all sections of the community are leading to control on the spread of the virus.
