If sampling will 312 be done, pooled, with several combinations of specialty and room, then stratified sampling 313 a As written in the Introduction, from our previous studies, more pairs of cases can be sampled in a day if cases are brief, because duration is not a significant covariate for transmission. 1, 15 For the observational data (Table 1) , case durations of the pairs were available for the first 209 pairs by date. Using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, there was the same finding of absence of association between duration and transmission (P = .91).
