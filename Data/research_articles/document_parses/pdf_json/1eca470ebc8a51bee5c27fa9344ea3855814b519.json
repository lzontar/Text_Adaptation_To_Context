Therefore, rapid early diagnosis of the disease is essential for early intervention and swift isolation of patients in order to prevent the spread of the virus. RT-PCR is considered as the 'gold standard', however, there are reports of false-negatives occurring which are eventually confirmed as true-positive by repeated swab tests [18] . False negatives can be a significant problem in high-throughput settings operating under severe pressure [19] . The correct operation of the test is crucial and there is ambiguity with respect to the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding, thus the timing of the test may very well dictate the result. Furthermore, it is also unclear what kind of clinical sample is most appropriate as nasopharyngeal swabs may offer greater consistency than sputum samples. When considering the limited supply of RT-PCR, the growing backlog and the likely increasing pressure and turnaround times in laboratories, the issues pertaining to false-negatives, some experts have concluded that to diagnose suspected cases using the widely available time-saving and non-invasive imaging approach of chest CT is justified as this approach can sensitively and specifically identify COVID-19 patients.
