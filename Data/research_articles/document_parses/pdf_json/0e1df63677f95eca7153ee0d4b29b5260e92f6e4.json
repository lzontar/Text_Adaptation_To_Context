The clinical implications of this finding are unclear. Lahti et al reported good agreement in PCR detection of 8 respiratory viruses among paired nasopharyngeal aspirates and IS specimens (j statistic, 0.58-1.00) [15] . One could hypothesize that assays performed on specimens from the lower respiratory tract would be more specific for lower respiratory tract infection, and PERCH will investigate this by comparing the viral loads in the 2 different types of specimens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 384, "end": 388, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Serological testing indicated that B. pertussis might be an important cause of pneumonia in young children in our community. Our ability to assess the correlation between serological evidence of infection and PCR detection of respiratory pathogens was limited by the low number of case patients with complete sampling. Of serologically detected cases of adenovirus or M. pneumoniae, none were detected by PCR; of PCR-detected cases of adenovirus or parainfluenza, none were evident on serological testing. The poor correlation may be related to a variety of factors, including poor immune responses to certain infections in young children or inadequate time elapsed between acute and convalescent sampling. Alternatively, it may reflect the nonspecificity of pathogen detection in the upper respiratory tract as a diagnostic marker of SP or VSP. This could be further explored by reassessing the correlation using results of quantitative PCR. For the final PERCH analysis, it may be necessary to treat serological testing as a diagnostically specific but not highly sensitive assay.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Only half of the eligible children with SP or VSP who died during their hospital stay participated in the study; this is notable because it may bias the etiological interpretation of fatal cases and because these are the children in whom it is critical to understand pneumonia etiology if we are to take concrete steps toward reducing mortality. There are no widely accepted guidelines for garnering informed consent from the parents of critically ill children; at the very least, measures are needed to ensure that investigators are trained in methods for approaching such individuals [20] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This study has several limitations. A stepwise introduction of sampling methods was used as the clinical capacity for specimen collection and laboratory capacity increased. Our assessment of pneumonia etiology (shown in Figure 1 ) should not be taken as a definitive study of etiology in Kilifi, because the full sampling algorithm was not implemented until the second quarter of the year and complete sampling was only available in one-third of the case patients. Indeed, the results illustrate the potential variability of etiology depending on the sampling methods used. Lung aspirates and postmortem studies were not performed. The case-control analysis was limited to a comparison of results from NPS specimens and serological testing; we could not assess the association between pathogen detection from other nonsterile site specimens and pneumonia hospitalization. We did not collect information on the duration of symptoms in case patients and controls, and it is possible that the high prevalence of viral detection in controls was related to illness in the recent past. Among case patients with VSP, 14% had malaria parasitemia and more than one-third were not given a diagnosis of pneumonia at the time of discharge. This is not unexpected, given that the World Health Organization case definition is deliberately nonspecific in order to be sensitive. In hospital settings, the specificity of the case definition for SP and VSP could probably be improved through the use of chest radiography, which will be a component of the PERCH study. This pilot study illustrates how adding specimens and assays to the sampling algorithm significantly increases the detection of potential pathogens and the impact of adjusting the assessment of etiology based on the results of a case-control analysis. Despite fairly comprehensive testing, the etiology of pneumonia remained unknown in a quarter of case patients. In some, the diagnosis may not have been pneumonia, and for others, more extensive testing may have been needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 228, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The experiences and findings of the pilot study have been used to help design the PERCH study. Although lung aspirates and postmortem studies were not performed in our pilot, it is recognized that these are critical to a better understanding of pneumonia etiology and fatal pneumonia in children, and the PERCH study will incorporate these procedures in selected sites [21] . The pilot study found that the collection of IS specimens was accepted by parents, well tolerated, feasible for use in a rural developing world setting, and provided useful diagnostic information; IS specimens will be collected from all case patients without contraindications. Although infectious serological testing is used with decreasing frequency in the molecular era, this type of test provided etiological information and may be helpful in the interpretation of associations between detection of a pathogen in the URT and pneumonia. If necessary, home visits will be conducted to increase the collection of convalescent serum specimens. The community accepted the recruitment and sampling of controls. For PERCH, specimens from controls will be expanded to include OPS, blood, and urine specimens (in addition to NPS specimens), to maximize the ability to detect associations between pathogen detection and hospitalization with pneumonia. Using a comprehensive approach, the PERCH study will be well-positioned to provide definitive information about the etiology of SP and VSP in children in the developing world.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 373, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at Clinical Infectious Diseases online (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org).
