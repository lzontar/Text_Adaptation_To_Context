However, sources of these data are scattered across several locations and web sites with heterogeneous formats that offer a large volume of unstructured information. Moreover, the needed knowledge was too difficult to find since the traditional search engines return ranked retrieval lists that offer little or no information on semantic relationships among those scattered information, and, even if it was found, the located information often overload since there was no content digestion. Accordingly, the automatic extraction of information expressions, especially the spatial and temporal information of the events, in natural language text with question answering system has become more obvious as a system that strives for moving beyond information retrieval and simple database query.",

Consequently, collecting the needed information from scattered resources is very difficult since the semantic relations among those resources are not directly stated.

For example: in the text in Fig. 2 , the time expression \"15 February\" mentioned only \"date and month\" of the bird flu event but did not mention the 'year'. The patient and her condition (i.e. '37-year-old female', and 'died') was caused by bird flu which is written in the text as 'Avian influenza' and 'H5N1 avian influenza'. Accordingly, the essential component of computational model for event information capturing is the recognition of interested entities including time expression, such as 'yesterday', 'last Monday', and 'two days before', which becomes an important part in the development of more robust intelligent information system for event tracking.",

Since the web consists of a large extent of unstructured or semi-structured natural language text, several techniques (i.e., language engineeering and knowledge engineering) are applied to information extracting and integrating. For language engineering, word segmentation [3] , named entity recognition [2] , shallow parsing [4] , shallow anaphora resolution and discourse processing [2, 5, 6] are utilized. For knowledge engineering, the concept of frame for structuring the extracted information is applied. For ontological engineering, task-oriented ontology, ontology maintenance [7] and Topic Maps [8] model are applied for information aggregation and organizing for smart access. Fig. 3 overviews the system architecture which has been designed for event tracking and its related knowledge organization for aiding multi-users information service provision [7, 9, 10] .

The Relation Extraction module is responsible for recognizing the relations between entities recognized by the Entity Recognition module. The output of this step is a graph representing relations among entities where a node in the graph represents an entity and the link between nodes represents the relationship of two entities. The Output Generation module is responsible for generating the n-tuple representing extracted information from the relation graph. The details of each module are described as followed.",

Secondly, each generated candidate is then tested against the probability distribution modeled by using maximum entropy. The features used to model the probability distribution can be classified into four categories: Word Features, Lexical Features, Dictionary Features, and Blank Features as described in [2] .

It then travels the graph to obtain all entities that are related to considered condition entity. After obtaining all related entities, the output n-tuple is generated by filtering all related entities using constrain imposed by the property of each slot. If the slot can contains only one entity, the entity that has the maximum probability will be chosen to fill the slot. In general, if the slot can contain up to n entities, the top-n entities will be selected. In addition, if there is no entity to fill the required slot, the mode (most frequent) of the entity of that slot will be used to fill instead. The time expression normalization using rule-based system and synonym resolution using ontology are also performed in this step to generalize the output n-tuple.
