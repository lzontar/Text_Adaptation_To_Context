Experiments on low-speed jets show that the peak force induced by a train of droplet impacts is over three times greater than the continuous stream counterpart [9] . This is due to the discretization of jet momentum, which, when imparted normal to a surface, is exerted over a short time interval, generating large forces. For WD, it is imperative that a series of droplet impacts occur instead of a continuous jet. Accordingly, the distance between the nozzle and droplet formation zone is a parameter of significant importance. Poor MRRs are expected if the nozzleto-workpiece, or stand-off distance (SOD) is less than the droplet break-up length. Limited studies have investigated this length for extremely fast jets [10, 11] , such as the >500 m/s waterjet used in this study.

Therefore, WD aims to mitigate these effects by allowing the jet/droplet stream to pass through a sub-atmospheric pressure environment (i.e., vacuum).

This is called lateral liquid jetting, which can reach speeds faster than the speed of sound (i.e., supersonic) [15] . These high velocities and pressures induce shear and compressive stresses onto the workpiece resulting in deformation and ultimate material failure and removal. Repeated droplet strikes rapidly erode the surface resulting in a dwelled pocket. When the jet traverses linearly across the workpiece, a trench profile is created. For relatively slow traverse speeds or for thin materials, the droplet stream can penetrate through the material resulting in a complete cut. In this scenario, some of the droplet stream will pass through the material untouched, which can lead to ambiguous interpretation of MRR results.

The SOD of 10 mm showed undetectable surface damage, while for larger SOD the MRR was increasingly higher. The poor MRR obtained from close SOD tests suggests that, at these lengths, the jet is still continuous and does not segment into droplets.

Figure 7 shows a linearly decreasing relationship between MRR and traverse speed. A line of best fit is plotted to elucidate this finding. It is noted that test condition WD1 created a cut and was therefore too deep for the profilometer to measure. At this low traverse speed, it is expected that the MRR would fall close to the line of best fit prediction. This unusual finding demands further investigation into the material removal mechanism(s) of WD. According to Eqs. (1-2), the impact pressure induced by the WD droplets is 1.32 GPa, which exceeds the material tensile strength. (This calculation was performed with parameters of pump pressure P=414 MPa (60 ksi), water density \u03c1=998 kg/m^3, and speed of sound in water c=1450 m/s.) The maximum impact force of low speed droplets is approximately 0.84 2 2 [26] , where is the droplet diameter. One possible explanation for the increased MRR at low traverse speeds is that a significant liquid pool develops over the micro-pits which can accelerate erosion. It has been shown that droplets impacting shallow pools induce greater peak forces than drops impacting dry surfaces [27] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 871, "end": 879, "text": "2 2 [26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 71, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "The average MRR of AWJ and WJ are 36.4 and 0.164, respectively, while for WD the MRR confers to the following relationship", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "where is the traverse speed. In Figure 8 (a) the MRR is plotted with respect to traverse speed. The MRR of each process are approximately an order of magnitude different from one another, with WJ being the lowest, AWJ the highest, and WD in between. From these results it can be asserted that the WD technique out-performs WJ, but does not exhibit the high MRR of AWJ. Another aspect of WD is its large trench width (see Figure 8 (b)). The reason for this is the radial dispersion of droplets from the jet axis. This affects the accuracy of the cutting process, which is not the focus of this research, but will need to be addressed to reduce this kerf width for industrial implementation. On the other hand, the resulting residue of WJ and WD is simply the material removed, instead of a material + abrasive particle slurry as in AWJ, which has an alternative goal for better metal cutting.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 32, "end": 40, "text": "Figure 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 421, "end": 429, "text": "Figure 8", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "A novel materials processing technique, WD, is presented, which features a high-speed stream of droplets that impact and erode solid materials. The stream of droplets travels through a sub-atmospheric pressure environment in order to mitigate airresistance and subsequent droplet break-up. This process is compared to similar conventional processes, i.e., AWJ and WJ cutting. The metric used to evaluate the erosion characteristics of each process is the MRR, which is the volume of removed material per unit time. This is performed on a difficult-tomachine steel, DP 1180. Trench profiles are created by traversing for each of the jets across the sample. The trench area and traverse speed are used to calculate the MRR. The abrasive waterjet exhibits the highest MRR of 36 mm 3 /s (average of all tests), followed by WD with 6.58 mm 3 /s, and finally WJ with 0.164 mm 3 /s.
