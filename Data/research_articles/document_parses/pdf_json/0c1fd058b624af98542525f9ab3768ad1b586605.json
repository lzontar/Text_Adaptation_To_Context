Predictions made using a geostatistical model have uncertainty that typically varies spatially. However, this uncertainty is difficult to map with the estimate itself and is often not included as a result, thereby generating a potentially misleading sense of certainty about disease burden or other important variables. To remedy this, we propose simultaneously visualising predictions and their associated uncertainty within a single map by varying pixel size. We illustrate our approach using examples of malaria incidence, but the method could be applied to predictions of any spatial continua with associated uncertainty.",

Since the removal of a contaminated water pump handle following John Snow's pioneering map of cholera in London (1854) [1] , disease maps have informed decisions in public health and epidemiology. Increasingly, researchers, governments, and organisations like the WHO and the UN set their priorities based on spatially varying predictions of disease burden. Interpolation and extrapolation from observed data using statistical models allow for prediction of disease burden at arbitrarily fine scales. These predictions have associated uncertainty. Communication of spatially heterogeneous uncertainty is vital to avoid misinterpretation and to highlight data gaps.",

(Geospatial is a general term that applies to a wide class of models including geostatistical models that are specifically concerned with spatial continua). To understand the uncertainty associated with predictions made using geostatistical models (and their geospatial counterparts), we briefly describe the geostatistical framework, albeit separate from that of visualisation. Under a geostatistical model it is assumed that there is a latent spatially continuous stochastic process (e.g. unobserved malaria risk) that underpins a measurement variable whose realisations we can observe (e.g. malaria cases) [3] . Given possibly noisy observations of the measurement variable at discrete sampling locations, a common goal is to predict this variable elsewhere (e.g. predict malaria cases at unsampled locations). Via the covariance structure of the stochastic process, the model imposes spatial correlation between observations. Typically, the predictive variance for locations distant from sampled locations exceeds that of nearby predictions. Sampling locations are often spatially heterogeneous (malaria case observations, for example, are almost always sparse and clustered in places with better access to care). As such, uncertainty can be highly variable in space (spatial heteroscedasticity). In addition to data on the measurement variable, spatial data on explanatory variables (e.g. elevation, vegetation) are sometimes included in the model to improve predictive accuracy and can thus influence the spatial heteroscedasticity.",

However, this high resolution can be extremely misleading, creating an illusion of precision where there is sometimes none. Maps of spatially varying uncertainty sometimes accompany predictions in the main text, e.g. [5] .

Specifically, we propose varying pixel size such that areas of high average uncertainty are unresolved, while areas with high average certainty are resolved (analogous to highly versus lowly resolved satellite images), thereby inviting a sense of precision only in areas where confidence is merited. To vary pixel sizes, predictions are first grouped into a number of large initial pixels (squares or rectangles comprising many predictions), whose lower bound is specified. The average uncertainty of the predictions within each large initial pixel is then computed; and, for each large initial pixel, predictions are either averaged across it (if the average uncertainty within it is high), or across smaller pixels nested within it (if the average uncertainty within it is lower). The resulting plot of averaged predictions is deliberately and selectively pixelated, similar to a photo that is deliberately and selectively pixelated to disguise a person's identity. For each large initial pixel, the size of any nested pixels depends on the quantile interval into which the associated average uncertainty falls, where quantiles are based on the empirical distribution of average uncertainty across all large initial pixels, and the number of quantile intervals (thus different pixel sizes) is user-specified. Quantile interval allocation plots show how uncertainty varies across large initial pixels; while tables summarising pixel dimensions quantify how pixel size translates to average uncertainty (see the vignette of package pixelate). The smallest pixel contains a single prediction; the per-pixel prediction count of larger pixels is calculated according to above mentioned parameters (plus two others that control the rate at which nested pixels scale); see the documentation of the pixelate function in the pixelate package. Pixelation can thus be fine tuned according to the needs of the researcher. Pixelation parameters should be reported alongside pixelated maps, similar to model parameters. It is also important to report if spatial covariance is accounted for, since pixelation relies on averaging uncertainty at the largest pixel size; see [9] and the vignette of the pixelate package for full details.

In Figure 1a , areas with high average uncertainty around the predicted P. falciparum incidence are visualised with large pixels and are thus unresolved, e.g. parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo; areas of relative certainty are visualised with smaller pixels and are thus more resolved, e.g. Uganda.

Among these resolved regions, high certainty is expected where epidemiological data are dense, e.g. likely Uganda (assuming that the temporal density shown in Figure S1 of [6] correlates with spatial density). However, information from explanatory variables can also contribute to increased certainty. For example, despite presumably sparse epidemiological data, the central region of the Albertine rift has low uncertainty (including many predictions that are zero with certainty), likely due to elevation. In future work, we will develop interactive maps that provide per-pixel summaries of the different contributions to average certainty. However, this requires enhancing model output as well as its visualisation.",

It also supports other visualisations of mapped uncertainty including bivariate choropleth and exceedance probability (EP) maps [10, 11] . Bivariate maps (e.g. of disease prevalence and its uncertainty [7] ) have been described as visual puzzles: very sophisticated but not very intuitive [1] . EP maps convey probabilities (e.g. the probability that a disease exceeds a specified prevalence [8] ), thus provide actionable insight for policy makers [11] .

The perception of area (e.g. pixel size) varies across different people [1] . However, in most cases, mapping aims to provide a relative overview (e.g. to enable policy makers to identify quickly priority regions) not absolute numbers. Perception may also differ according to expertise: to a geostatistician, smoothness in the covariance structure is a hallmark of data sparsity, whereas we rely on a non-technical interpretation of smoothness: regions with relative certainty are depicted using smaller pixels and are thus more resolved, akin to an information rich satellite image. Since mapping is intended to transfer knowledge e.g. from the geostatistician to a policy maker, we think its more appropriate to rely on a non-technical interpretation. Other limitations are surmountable: if there is no spatial variation among pixelated predictions, spatial variation in uncertainty will be invisible. In this case, it would make more sense to plot uncertainty directly (e.g. Figure 1c ). Finally, it is important to note that pixelation is a visualisation approach only.",

The bottom-left inset of panel 1b delineates the central African region. The lower bound on the number of large initial pixels in both the horizontal and vertical direction was set to 12. Other parameters were set to default values: six different pixel sizes (zoom to see the smallest) that scale by iterative multiplication with factor one.",
