Research areas include flood, hydrology, hydraulics and coastal engineering at various spatial and temporal scales. Typhoons, tsunamis and monsoons are some of the typical processes that might lead to severe storm surges, high waves and associated coastal disasters. Further, heavy precipitations could give rise to severe flash floods, particularly under the scenarios of sea level rise and climate change. Wetlands and mangroves serve several important ecosystem functions, the demise of which may lead to major natural disasters. Hence, a systematic and quantitative study by means of physically based models and monitoring is essential to protect and enhance their ecological functions. Only two fields relating to the simulations of tsunami evolution and infectious disease transmission dynamics are discussed in this paper. Tsunamis are large, potentially destructive sea waves, most of which are formed as a result of submarine earthquakes. But tsunami may also result from the eruption or collapse of island or coastal volcanoes and from the formation of giant marine landslides. Tsunami can potentially be very destructive; hence methods for mitigation are needed to protect vulnerable coastal regions and communities. In the recent past, several infectious disease epidemics have occurred in many parts of the world. These diseases include H1N1, SARS and dengue, which have the potential of causing global havoc. The simulations of the transmission dynamics of these diseases provide a means to suggest control measures to reduce their impacts. However, these types of simulations often involve large computational resources, for which grid technology may be applied to enhance the simulation efficiency. We will demonstrate how these two types of simulations are performed in the traditional nongrid environment. Then we will show how grid computing may be used to enhance computational efficiency.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RESEARCH AREAS"}, {"text": "A good mathematical description of tsunami propagation may be given by the socalled Shallow Water Equations (1) to (3) as follows.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SIMULATION OF TSUNAMI EVOLUTION"}, {"text": "Here, discharge fluxes (M, N) in the x-and y-directions are related to velocities u and v by the expressions M=u(h+\uf020\uf068)=uD , N=v(h+\uf068)=vD, where h is the sea depth and \uf068 is the water elevation above mean sea level. The staggered explicit finite difference method is employed to solve the Shallow Water Equations, as the scheme is known to perform well, provided that the time step \u2206t fulfils the Courant stability criterion (Equation 4). Details regarding this numerical scheme used in the in-house tsunami simulation model TUNA developed by the authors are available elsewhere (Koh et al. 2009a, b; Teh et al. 2009 ) and hence will be omitted. An initial vertical lifting of the seabed due to the 2004 Andaman earthquake is represented by a five-segment fault, resulting in a leading depression tsunami wave propagating towards Thailand and Malaysia. Figure 1 (first frame from left) clearly demonstrates the initial waves splitting into two halves, one propagating eastwards, the other westwards. The tsunami waves reach the offshore of Phuket of Thailand after a travel time of about 2 hours (Figure 1 , second frame). Subsequently the waves propagate towards Malaysia, arriving offshore of Langkawi ( Figure 1 , third frame) after 3 hours. The final snapshot ( Figure 1 , fourth frame) shows the waves propagating through the Straits of Malacca, having moved pass Penang. The computational time used for one simulation is about 8 hours on a regular lower end PC, with a scheme consisting of more than 10 million computational nodes. For community disaster mitigation, we need to perform thousands of simulations in order to generate a large database of tsunami propagation scenarios to permit adequate assessment of vulnerability and to prepare risk maps for affected coastal regions. Hence, the need to reduce computational time is obvious. Through careful analysis and reorganization of the finite difference scheme, we are able to shorten the computational time to 2 hours, without loss of accuracy and reliability of the simulation results on a similar PC. First, the nonlinear terms consisting of the friction terms can be removed as friction terms contribute insignificantly towards the simulation results in deep water. Then we use optimization methods to improve computational performance, such as loop interchange, loop unrolling, loop fusion/fission and floating point division, as briefly shown in Figure 2 . Finally, a higher end PC reduces the computational time to 1 hour.

Mosquitoes disperse in the form of traveling waves, with characteristics that can be determined from observations and from simulations of the model DEER. Numerical simulations and theoretical estimation may be performed to assess the wave front velocity, mosquito density distribution patterns and the disease prevalence. The results of these simulations provide the scientific basis for assessing the effectiveness of mosquito and associated disease containment strategy.

Comparison between simulation results for both models and analytical solutions indicate proper performance of both models. It is widely known that mosquito populations are sensitive to temperature (Schoofield et al. 1981 ; Rueda et al. 1990 ). Hence, we simulate the impact of temperature variations on mosquito populations as shown in Figure 4 . With cold temperature between 4 and 6 degree Celsius (\uf0b0C) in Case 1, both adult and aquatic forms quickly crash as the cold temperature causes high mortality and low reproduction. At higher temperature between 8 and 12 \uf0b0C for Case 2, both aquatic and adult forms manage to survive at low density. However, at favorable temperature between 15 and 21 \uf0b0C, both forms respond favorably to achieve high density. We have chosen the temperature to vary within short intervals to illustrate that mosquitoes can respond to temperature quickly due to their fast growth and reproduction cycles, implying that quick response to temperature is indeed possible within a confined environment. However the real concern is the potential impact of climate change on mosquito population distribution over large spatial and temporal scales, and the associated health risk (Patz et al. 1998; Reiter 2001; Hopp & Foley 2003) , the simulation of which can be facilitated by the application of grid computing. Figures 5 and 6 summarize the effects of human-mosquito transmission probability DIS and HDIS on the incidence of dengue infections in human, subject to MOSVIRUS parameter values given by Table 2 . DIS is the transmission probability of dengue virus from infected human to susceptible mosquitoes; while HDIS is the transmission probability of dengue virus from infected mosquitoes to susceptible human. With all other parameter values fixed as in Table 2 , DIS is varied among 0.60, 0.40 and 0.20. Figure 5 clearly demonstrates the effects of DIS on the number of humans been infected with dengue virus, with high incidence rate at high DIS values. Similarly, with all other parameter values fixed as in Table 2 , HDIS is varied among 0.70, 0.60 and 0.50. The effect of HDIS on the number of humans infected by dengue virus is clearly demonstrated in Figure 6 , with high incidence rate at high HDIS values. Thus DIS and HDIS are important control parameters for dengue management strategy (Gratz et al. 1991 ).

However, simulations of swamp water mosquito population dynamics over a large geographical region subject to varying hydrological input will require large computing resources (Shaman et al. 2005) , for which grid computing is appropriate. Further, mosquito can transmit diseases to other animals, such as birds and horses, enabling the diseases to spread quickly over large geographical areas. Figure 7 shows the spread of West Nile Encephalitis (WNE) in USA over a period of three years, starting at 1999, indicating a wave front travel speed of 1000 km per year, while mosquitoes can only fly about tens of meter per day. This implies that two time scales and two spatial scales are involved in WNE transmission. The spatial-temporal distribution of mosquito population may be modeled by a set of partial differential equations PDE consisting of Equations 7 and 8 (Koh et al. 2008 ). This model describes the local ecology of mosquito populations without disease subject to reproduction, diffusion and advective transport, over a heterogeneous region.

We therefore model the regional migration of birds and the regional spread of associated diseases with large meshes of 10 km in length, while smaller mesh sizes of 100 m are used to simulate local mosquito ecology and local transmission of WNE among mosquitoes and humans, using MOSVIRUS as a template. Hence, each computational mesh of 10 km by 10 km is assigned to a core computational grid, with each core performing the internal simulations of local mosquito-human transmission via MOSVIRUS formulation. This approach may be modified for simulations of other infectious diseases involving birds, animals and humans, such as the avian flu H5N1, which may be transmitted over large distances by migratory birds. Further, the surface protein structure of these viruses may be simulated by grid computing for the purpose of searching for effective drug.
