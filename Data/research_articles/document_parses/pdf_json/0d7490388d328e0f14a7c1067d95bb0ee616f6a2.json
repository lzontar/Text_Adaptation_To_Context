Revisionista.PT can uncover the news cycle of online media, offering a glimpse into an otherwise unknown dynamic edit history. We leverage on article snapshots periodically collected by Web archives to reconstruct an approximate timeline of the changes: additions, edits, and corrections. Revisionista.PT is currently tracking changes in about 140,000 articles published by 12 selected news sources and has a user-friendly interface that will be familiar to users of version control systems. In addition, an open source browser extension can be installed by users so that they can be alerted of changes to articles they may be reading. Initial work on this demo was started as an entry submitted into Arquivo.PT 's 2019 Prize, where it received an award for second place.",

These trends may have contributed to the increased media mistrust that is discussed today under the controversial term fake news, described as \"a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes\" [2] .",

For Revisionista.PT , we opted to customise an algorithm that is used in Google Docs to Track Changes Google [3] but in word-based mode. Word-based level diffs are important to allow interpreting the differences between versions (e. g., entities changes, typos corrected, etc. ), improving readability and enabling simple browsing and search on diff text.
