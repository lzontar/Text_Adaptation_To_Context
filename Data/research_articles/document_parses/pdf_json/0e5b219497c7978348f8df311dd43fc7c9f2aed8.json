We know that public health measures such as early detection, quarantine and isolation of cases can be effective in conaining the outbreak. All health personnel should be alert to the risk of COVID-19 in a wide variety of occupations, and not only to health care workers. These occupational groups can be protected by good infection control practices. These at-risk groups should also be given adequate social and mental health support, which is needed but sometimes overlooked [12, 13] .",
