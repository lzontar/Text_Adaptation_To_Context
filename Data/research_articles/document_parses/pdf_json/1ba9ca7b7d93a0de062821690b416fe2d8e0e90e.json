It has resulted in a difficult situation for cancer patients owing to the risks of the epidemic situation outbreak as well as cancer. Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID-19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment. Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China and the world. Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment-related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns.",

The causative pathogen was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus). 1, 2 Owing to its extremely high infectivity and the susceptibility of the population, the 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) has spread rapidly and widely in China and several other countries in less than two months. Faced with the gravity of the epidemic, China has incorporated COVID-19 into the statutory Class B infectious diseases and controlled it in accordance with the Class A infectious diseases. Hospitals are not only the gathering places for suspected and diagnosed COVID-19 patients but also high-risk areas for infection. Reducing on-site hospital gathering is a highly effective prevention and control measure to reduce the risk of cross infection, which has obviously affected the routine examination and treatment of lung cancer patients in regions affected by the epidemic.",

The number of severe cases was approximately five times higher in cancer patients than in the general population (39% vs. 8%, P = 0.0003). 3 In addition, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 since they are usually elderly patients and smokers and have low immunity, poor nutritional status and poor lung conditions. Thus, they need to be well protected from COVID-19. Conversely, some advanced lung cancer patients need to receive regular antitumor treatment due to the high tumor burden and deal with treatment-related adverse events. Therefore, to minimize the effect of the epidemic on lung cancer patients, providing recommendations of scientific and reasonable treatment and preventive measures for lung cancer patients in the global epidemic scenario is an urgent requirement. Based on the characteristics of lung cancer, this article focuses on individualized treatment recommendations and measures for adverse events management during the COVID-19 epidemic.",

In addition, patients should perform proper exercises at home to enhance their immunity. Adequate sleep is essential to maintain a good emotional state, and suitable methods to relieve tension, anxiety, and other emotions should be practiced; a safe and nutritious diet without raw meat and eggs must be consumed.

One study showed that lung cancer patients with a sluggish recovery can still benefit from delayed adjuvant chemotherapy starting four months after surgery without increasing mortality. 5 Therefore, the duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with postoperative lung cancer with earlier clinical stage and better prognosis can be appropriately extended during the epidemic. In addition, for patients with lymph node stage N2 after surgery with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment at home may be considered as the optional adjuvant treatment option, 6 which may reduce the risk of cross infection caused by repeated hospital visits.",

Therefore, while we attach importance to the adverse effects of this epidemic on chemotherapy delays in patients with lung cancer, we should also regard the adjustment of chemotherapy regimen rationally.

Patients whose symptoms are obviously relieved after targeted therapy and those with stable disease can be appropriately deferred to the hospital for review during the epidemic.

For advanced lung cancer patients receiving targeted therapy with sensitive gene mutations, the scheduled examination can be appropriately postponed or delayed on the basis of the cancer conditions. The interval between examinations can be extended to more than 2-3 months for patients with symptomatic remission or stable disease. During the postponed examination period, patients are advised to continuously take the original targeted drugs and closely monitor symptoms. Patients should be examined immediately and be kept well-protected from infection, if symptoms progressively worsen. Examinations during chemotherapy should be performed in a timely manner as far as possible under permissible epidemic situations. The examination procedures and methods should be simplified to shorten hospital stays. After examination, patients may consult oncologists online or offline to comprehensively select the appropriate follow-up treatment plans.",

After vomiting, we recommend that patients rinse their mouths with warm water in order to keep their mouths clean as well as clearing up vomit to avoid revomiting caused by the pungent smell. Moreover, if the manifestations continue, such as abnormal vomit color, excessive vomiting and dizziness, then patients should be taken to hospital for symptomatic treatment.",

Even patients without typical clinical symptoms, and peripheral blood routine performance cannot rule out the possibility of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recommend that patients complete epidemiological history screening, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and IgM/IgG antibody tests at designated hospitals to rule out COVID-19 infection from other bacteriological infectious pneumonia or drug-induced lung injury. 28 The procedures recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection screening and distinguished diagnosis are shown in Fig 1.

We recommend that lung cancer patients may utilize association, relaxation exercises, appropriate venting to eliminate negative emotions, 31 and use online psychological consultations and interventions if necessary. 32 In conclusion, the COVID-19 epidemic is undoubtedly a profound global health emergency, but people worldwide are courageous and need to be brave to fight this battle.
