In this paper, we examine the problem of classifying hotel critiques using views expressed in users' reviews. There is a massive development of opinions and reviews on the web, which invariably include assessments of products and services, and beliefs about events and persons. In this study, we aim to face the problem of the forever increasing amount of opinionated data that is published in a variety of data sources. The intuition is the extraction of meaningful services despite the lack of sufficient existing architectures. Another important aspect that needs to be taken into consideration when dealing with brand monitoring, relates to the rapid heterogeneous data processing, which is vital to be implemented in real-time in order for the business to react in a more immediate way.",

As an escalating number of consumers are inclined to share as well as exchange their personal experiences in social networks, forums and websites, the tourism industry has radically altered the way of increasing and influencing customers' engagement with tourism brands [10] . In this new era of e-tourism, businesses, in order to keep up with the upsurging competition, have to develop innovative marketing strategies and techniques focused on customers' needs and satisfaction. Subsequently, in the last years, there has been a wide interest in extracting actionable insights on customers' behaviour and sentiment by leveraging user-generated content, that will enable businesses to identify and in following predict the usefulness of online reviews [4] .",

A dynamic architecture, which receives the data stream, on-line or off-line in order not to overload the systems of the participating hotels or their service providers, is proposed. It extracts the aspects along with the sentiment of the hotel reviewers by applying LDA and NN modules accordingly, then stores the data and finally, attempts to correlate the data with the reviewers. The process is not obvious, given the anonymity of the reviewers, but the attempt to correlate them can be implemented with extensive training of the NN. Our architecture proposes a novel platform utilizing the benefits of both algorithms, so that it can be used in an effective way in data forecasting.",

More specifically, authors performed a summarizing of the numerous comments and reviews regarding particular products, and in following extracted a comprehensive polarity percentage that represents the sentiment of the buyers as a whole. Altogether, the sentiment of a review as well as the general sentiment that hotel reviews accumulate, can produce a meaningful abstraction and pinpoint either problems that the management can solve or aid potential customers in choosing their next hotel [18] .",

Before advancing to the classification and performance evaluation steps, two important layers take place; data transformation and filtering. Data were cleaned and stripped of useless tags, and in following, stemming and lemmatization procedures occurred. During the filtering step, a statistical analysis to measure the dependency between word and category that the word is included, was performed with the aid of the Chi-square test. As shown in the performance evaluation step, all measurements were improved when considering the pre-processing procedure in comparison to completely avoiding that step, in terms of the three basic evaluation metrics, namely F 1-measure, accuracy and recall.",

One of the most classic text mining techniques that composed the foundation for modern opinion mining is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2, 7, 8] . LDA is a probabilistic algorithm that can discover the latent topics that may exist within the reviews of the collection. More specifically, LDA extracts the top N topics that are most common in a review, based on the representations of the most frequent words with the input being a term document matrix, whereas two distributions are considered as output; one for document-topic relations and the other for topic-word ones.",
