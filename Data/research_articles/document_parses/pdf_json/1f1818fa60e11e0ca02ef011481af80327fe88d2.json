It has been shown that ACE2 plays a protective role in chronic pathologies, like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, that are the comorbidities representing the risk of worse prognosis in COVID-19. The protective role of ACE2 has been evidenced by studies in mice models, showing more severe lung failure upon ACE2 down-regulation 6 .",

All in all, further studies appear as mandatory to evaluate: (i) whether women who use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are better protected from respiratory failure than women who do not use HRT; (ii) whether estrogenic agonists, increasing ACE2 expression levels, could represent promising tools to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. Notwithstanding, the study of the role of XCI escaping genes, and of their regulators, could represent a major challenge to understand the sexspecific pathogenic determinants of COVID-19 disease progression.",
