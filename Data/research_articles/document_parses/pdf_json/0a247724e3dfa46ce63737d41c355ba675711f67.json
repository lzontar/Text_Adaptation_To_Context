Chemotherapy is known to induce an immunodeficiency state by significantly depleting T-cells, as well as NK-cells and B-cells. 4, 5 Usually, immune reconstitution begins after completing chemotherapy. In children, greater than 2 years of age, who received intense chemotherapy for treatment of high-risk ALL, T-cell recovery was complete 12-18 months after cessation of chemotherapy. In addition, the absolute CD3 + count at 1 month was greater than 300 cells/ l in these patients. 5, 6 We describe five children who completed treatment for infantile ALL and soon after were diagnosed with persistent severe T-cell, non-HIV, immunodeficiency, with varying B-cell and NK-cell depletion, resulting in severe infections causing death in four and successful hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in one.

Patients in our cohort remained mildly to severely lymphopenic and flow cytometry demon-strated extremely low CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T-cell populations consistent with a severe T-cell immunodeficiency despite completion of their chemotherapy treatment 2-13 months prior. We believe it is very unlikely that our patients had unrecognized PID. None of these patients had strong identifiers of PID, such as failure to thrive or intravenous antimicrobial use prior to ALL diagnosis. 10 Patient B did have a distant family history of RAG2 deficiency but she did not carry this mutation. Investigations prior to starting chemotherapy suggested patients A, B, and C had been exposed to viral infections with no major complications. Finally, Patient E had an extensive genetic workup excluding common SCID mutations and Patients A and C had normal TREC assays. Based on the described history and investigations, we concluded these were secondary immunodeficiencies produced by the chemotherapy.",

Normal thymic involution does not begin until approximately 7 years of age. 4 Thymic enlargement post chemotherapy has been demonstrated in pediatric patients. 6 In most children treated for standard-risk and high-risk ALL, CD4 + , and CD8 + T-cells require 3-18 months to recover and the CD3 + count at 1 month was greater than 300 cells/ l regardless of treatment intensity. 5, 6 Despite these prolonged impairments in immune function, severe opportunistic infections are not typically appreciated after cessation of chemotherapy, and death from infection is rare. 13 These T-cell recovery patterns were not seen in our patients.",

None of the studies examining immune reconstitution after chemotherapy have focused on infants; thus the pattern of immune recovery compared to older children is unknown. All of our patients had severe T-cell deficiency with a CD3 + count less than 100 cells/ l, despite some being only mildly lymphopenic. The patients who underwent autopsy were found to have profound thymic involution, suggesting damage to the thymus, which likely contributed to poor T-cell recovery. Patient B was treated with IL-7 because of previous reports in patients post-HSCT or with HIV that CD4 + Tcells recovered with IL-7 therapy. 16-19 Unfortunately, despite this treatment, her T-cells showed no signs of recovery. These are the first reported cases of non-HIV, severe, persistent T-cell immunodeficiency, with varying B-cell and NK-cell depletion, secondary to infant ALL chemotherapy. These children may benefit from preemptive and aggressive infection management and/or require therapies to assist with immune reconstitution, such as HSCT. However, the prevalence of this complication is unknown. Formal evaluation to identify abnormal T-cell recovery should be considered in all patients with infant ALL following modern intensive chemotherapy protocols.",
