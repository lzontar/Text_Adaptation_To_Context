To investigate drivers of virus spillover, we evaluated the number of viruses mammalian species have shared with humans. We discovered that the number of zoonotic viruses detected in mammalian species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal-human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission.

We incorporated two independent parameters to adjust for potential reporting bias. First, we quantified research publications available in PubMed for each mammalian species in our dataset, and log number of PubMed publications was included in multivariable modelling. Second, we created a data deficient/unknown trend category for each mammalian species in our dataset using IUCN classifications. When there is inadequate information available to make a population assessment, the IUCN classifies some terrestrial mammalian species as data deficient (DD, n = 790). In addition, population trend was unknown for many species, including some NT (n = 57) and LC species (n = 1371). Species lacking enough data to be categorized according to listing criteria, as well as NT and LC species lacking population trend data, were combined into a data deficient/unknown trend category for analyses (table 1).

Among 5335 wild terrestrial mammal species, we found that only 11.4% of mammalian species (n = 609) have been identified with one or more of the zoonotic viruses investigated here and, of these, most species (58.1%, n = 354) have been reported with only one zoonotic virus each. In line with recent studies [5, 21] , we found that the highest proportion of zoonotic viruses were reported among species in the orders Rodentia (61%), Chiroptera (30%), Primates (23%), Artiodactyla (21%), Carnivora (18%) and fewer viruses were detected in other mammalian orders (figure 1). Zoonotic virus species richness was highly correlated with mammalian species richness when mammalian host species were grouped by taxonomic order (\u03c1 = 0.791, p < 0.001), indicating that mammalian orders with more species are the source of more zoonotic viruses (figure 1a), as has been detected in a similar dataset of zoonotic diseases [21] . We found that three mammalian orders (rodents, bats and primates) have together been implicated as hosts for the majority (75.8%) of zoonotic viruses described to date, and these orders represent 72.7% of all terrestrial mammal species. As a group, domesticated mammals host 50% of the zoonotic virus richness but represent only 12 species.

Adjusting for reporting bias prior to the interpretation of other putative factors was important, given publication of zoonotic hosts in the literature was the basis for inclusion in this study, and the inclusion of number of PubMed publications improved model fit as evidenced by change in AIC (electronic supplementary material, table S1). The final ZIP model indicates that conservation status, several criteria for species reductions, taxonomic order and domesticated species status were also significantly related to the number of zoonotic viruses detected in each mammalian species (table 2) .

Less common wildlife species, categorized with increasingly threatened status by the IUCN Red List, were implicated with significantly fewer viruses shared with people, compared to widespread and abundant wild mammalian species. Terrestrial wild animal species of least concern with increasing population trends (n = 58) were reported with significantly more zoonotic viruses, while species with decreasing population trends (n = 391) had significantly fewer zoonotic viruses, compared to species with stable population trends (n = 1281). After adjusting for all factors, we detected a dose-response type relationship between increasingly threatened conservation status and a corresponding decrease in the number of viruses mammals share with humans. The gradual decrease in incidence rate ratios as species abundance declines from least concern conservation status with increasing population trend to critically endangered provides evidence for this trend (table 2) . With the exception of species categorized as threatened owing to over-exploitation and habitat loss, this trend can be summarized as follows; species of least concern with increasing abundance were estimated with 1.5 times the number of zoonotic viruses, while species of least concern with decreasing abundance had three-fourths the number of viruses, species not threatened, but decreasing in abundance had onethird the number of viruses, vulnerable species had less than one-sixth the number of viruses, endangered species had oneseventh the number of viruses, and critically endangered had one-thirteenth the number of viruses, compared to species of least concern that were stable in abundance. In an additional analysis of a subset of species that were not found to be data deficient, we found conservation status had a positive linear relationship with the number of zoonotic viruses reported in a species (data shown in the electronic supplementary material). We found that threatened species listed because of their small extent of occurrence (IUCN Red List category B1, n = 499 species) harboured approximately one-fifth as many zoonotic viruses compared to species listed for other reasons when all predictors, including detection bias, were included in the model (table 2) . Other IUCN Red List criteria and subcriteria indicative of small extent of habitat (figure 2) were also correlated with fewer virus detections in a species. In fact, threatened species listed because of very small area of occupancy (IUCN Red List criteria B2), and very small or restricted populations (IUCN Red List criteria D2) have yet to be reported with any zoonotic viruses (figure 2). Previous analyses of parasite richness in primates have found that total parasite richness was lower for species with threatened status, suggesting that small populations with limited geographical range harbour fewer parasites overall [22, 23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3083, "end": 3087, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3088, "end": 3091, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 197, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1166, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2444, "end": 2453, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "(a) Zoonotic virus richness scales with wild mammalian abundance"}, {"text": "Wild mammals with threatened conservation status (i.e. IUCN's Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered status) are increasingly rare, and the probability of a human encounter is thus presumed to be less likely, unless a species has adapted to human-dominated habitats or is otherwise in frequent contact with humans. Endangered and critically endangered species include many of the most charismatic and intensively managed species in the world, and thus we expected opportunities for virus spillover from species to be more frequent from these species. To further evaluate disparities in zoonotic virus richness among threatened species, we assessed the Red List's listing criteria and sub-criteria in a multivariable modelling approach and found that threatened species for which a population reduction was directly observed (IUCN Red List criteria A1(a), A2 (a) or A4 (a), n = 53 species) were predicted to host over 2 times as many zoonotic viruses, compared to species listed as threatened by other means when all other variables were accounted for in the model (table 2) . Wildlife populations with declines that have been directly observed were probably more closely monitored to be able to detect changes in population abundance, and often, longterm monitoring programmes accompany species management plans, thereby increasing the likelihood of disease detection and reporting. Also, intensive and often hands-on wildlife management can increase opportunities for pathogen transmission from animals to humans, supporting a biological basis for increased spillover risk beyond increased detection. Direct and indirect contact with wildlife in management and ecotourism settings is a recognized risk for zoonotic spillover, along with increased occupational risk among veterinarians and researchers attending to wildlife [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1833, "end": 1836, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1073, "end": 1082, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "(a) Zoonotic virus richness scales with wild mammalian abundance"}, {"text": "Among all criteria used to categorize species as threatened with extinction, we identified three additional criteria significantly related to the number of viruses a mammal shares with humans (table 2) . After adjusting for other significant effects in the multivariable model, we find that threatened species with a population size reduction owing to exploitation (IUCN Red List category A1-A4(d), n = 256 species) have over twice as many zoonotic viruses as compared to threatened species listed for other reasons (table 2) . Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and the wild animal trade have been hypothesized as increasing opportunities for pathogen spillover because of the close contact between wildlife and humans involved in these activities [4, 12, 24, 25] . Threatened species with population reductions owing to declines in occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or habitat quality (A1-A4(c), n = 353 species) were also predicted to host nearly twice as many zoonotic viruses compared to threatened species declining for other reasons, if all other factors were held constant (table 2). Anthropogenic activities that have altered the landscape, such as forest fragmentation, development and conversion to cropland, have caused declines in wildlife habitat quality, and, as with exploitation, are likely to also increase the probability of animal-human interactions during and subsequent to land conversion activities [26, 27] . Human encroachment into biodiverse areas increases the risk of spillover of novel infectious diseases by enabling new contacts between humans and wildlife [28] . Slightly more than half of all threatened species (54.8%) were listed by IUCN because of the impacts of exploitation or habitat loss on species abundance indicating that this is a major impetus for species reductions. Our analysis incorporating data on species declines globally provides broad-scale support for convergent processes whereby exploitation of wildlife and habitat loss have caused wildlife population declines, as well as facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans that most likely occurred prior to and during large-scale losses in abundance. expected of animal species that are unprecedented in their distribution, often reared in dense populations, and have been in close contact with people for centuries [13] . We find that domesticated species status had the largest influence on the number of mammalian viruses shared with humans with eight times more zoonotic viruses predicted in a given domesticated mammal species compared to wild mammalian species ( viruses), dogs (n = 27 zoonotic viruses), goats (n = 22 zoonotic viruses), cats (n = 16 zoonotic viruses) and camels (n = 15 zoonotic viruses). Aside from humans, accurate detection and reporting of zoonotic viruses would be most probable in domesticated species, given the economic and public health demand for these data. More accurate detection in domesticated species is supported by the minimal change in estimated number of viruses in regression models with the number of publications (table 2) and without the number of publications as an adjustment for reporting bias (electronic supplementary material, table S3). The only wild animals among the top 10 species with detected zoonotic viruses were the house mouse (Mus musculus) and the black rat (Rattus rattus), with 16 and 14 zoonotic viruses, respectively. Both of these species in the Rodentia order are considered invasive in most regions of the world, commonly inhabit domestic and peri-domestic structures, and have dubious non-domestication status given their use in laboratory studies and as pets worldwide. Sympatry, or spatial overlap of hosts, was highly correlated with cross-species transmission among rodents, and network analyses illustrate that the global distribution of the house mouse has facilitated the transmission of viruses to sympatric species around the world [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 755, "end": 758, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 759, "end": 762, "text": "12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 763, "end": 766, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1434, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1438, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1600, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2340, "end": 2344, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3939, "end": 3943, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 201, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 516, "end": 525, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 3084, "end": 3093, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "(b) Convergence in drivers for mammalian species declines and zoonotic virus richness"}, {"text": "Additional support for species domestication as a key feature of increased propensity for sharing viruses with humans is provided by the bipartite network of zoonotic viruses sharing among all mammalian hosts ( figure 3) .

While directionality in historical transmission of viruses between wild mammals and their domesticated kin can only be inferred, we postulate that wild mammals were the original host for the majority of viruses, sharing viruses with domesticated species over centuries of coevolution and domestication.

Close phylogenetic relatedness between globally distributed domesticated species and their wild perissodactyl, artiodactyl and carnivore brethren has probably intensified opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission [30] .

The close phylogenetic relationship of humans with non-human primates is recognized as a causal factor underlying spillover, reverse zoonoses and the coevolution of occasionally shared viruses [31] . Bats have also been repeatedly implicated as the source of recent emerging infectious disease events involving high consequence pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [32] , Nipah virus encephalitis [33] , and hemorrhagic fevers caused by filoviruses [34, 35] , and have been noted previously to host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents [10] . Viral sharing has been shown to be more common among bat species than among rodent species and several bat traits have been associated with a higher propensity for cross-species transmission, including gregariousness (roosting in high densities) and migration [29] . With nearly a quarter of bat species lacking sufficient data for categorization of their IUCN Red List status, bats are probably still under-represented in field investigations and warrant future dedicated focus for emerging infectious disease research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 676, "end": 679, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 875, "end": 879, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1076, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1108, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1160, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1164, "text": "35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1524, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 195, "text": "(table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "(d) Primates and bats share more viruses with humans"}, {"text": "Infectious diseases from wildlife have emerged at an increased pace within the last century [36] and are likely to continue to emerge, given expected increases in population growth and landscape change.

Reservoir populations have a critical population or community size required for infectious disease transmission [37] , and generally larger populations are more likely to propagate cycles of infection. Population range size similarly reflects opportunities for animal contact, and species with larger ranges should have increased potential to overlap in range, and possibly share habitat with other species, enabling cross-species transmission and increasing the risk of spillover to humans [29] . However, determinants identified as predictors of zoonotic virus richness at this scale might not relate to zoonotic virus diversity in species at the local scale.

Approximately one quarter of mammalian species had stable or increasing trends in abundance at the time of analysis, half of which were rodents [14] . While urbanization and landscape change towards crop production could decrease biodiversity overall, these activities can increase the abundance of select species [39] . Many species listed as least concern with increasing abundance by the IUCN Red List are adaptable wild mammalian species that have benefitted from a close relationship with humans. These species could have habitat and dietary niches that overlap with humans in dwellings or in agricultural practices, further enabling direct and indirect contact with similarly adapted sympatric species, domesticated species and humans. In particular, dwellings and agricultural settings are among the most high risk of interfaces for zoonotic viral transmission, particularly from rodents [4] . Pathogen transmission among animals thriving in human-dominated landscapes can also benefit from higher community size and density-dependent viral transmission, especially when resources that sustain mammal populations are aggregated [40] , further increasing the probability of human contact with infectious reservoirs in these landscapes.

While we shed light on the patterns of zoonotic viruses that have been reported up through the time of this study, we suspect that pathogen spillover often goes unnoticed, with only a proportion of spillover events expanding into outbreaks in people that are subsequently detectable. The evidence of serologic exposure to zoonotic pathogens with high mortality in humans, such as filoviruses, in areas not previously recognized with outbreaks, supports the premise that zoonotic pathogen exposure is more common than recognized [42] . Surveillance for acute febrile illness among people engaged in highrisk activities involving animals, especially wildlife, is a priority to enable more rapid detection of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Surveillance activities that include animals and humans in close contact situations will advance outbreak preparedness in between outbreaks and assist in prioritizing in-depth, longitudinal field studies needed to understand epidemiological patterns in virus transmission and optimize disease prevention actions. Informed mitigation efforts aimed at ensuring biosafety in livestock production, minimizing interactions between wildlife and domesticated animals and limiting close contact with wildlife are especially needed given global trends in urbanization and food production.
