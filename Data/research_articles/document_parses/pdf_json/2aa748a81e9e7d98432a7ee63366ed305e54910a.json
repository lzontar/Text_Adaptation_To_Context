[2] [3] [4] [5] In all instances, clinical inputs (eg, vital signs and physical assessments) are assigned numerical values and combined to produce a total score purported to stratify a patient's risk for deterioration. At our institution, we modified an existing PEWS 1 to align with our institutional practice. It has been used on inpatient units for over a decade. Traditionally, bedside nurses calculate PEWS by hand, and the final score is manually entered into the medical record. This method has many problems. For example, delayed or inconsistent nursing documentation may lead to delays in the calculation of an early warning score, 6, 7 undermining its ability to provide early, real-time identification of children at risk for deterioration. Additionally, manual calculation has poor interrater reliability and accuracy. [8] [9] [10] This finding was true at our institution, as chart audits revealed frequent inaccuracies in manual PEWS calculation where the score commonly did not match the documented vitals signs used in its calculation.",

Manual calculation is prone to human error. Electronic health records (EHRs) enable automated calculation, removing human error. This study's objective was to compare the accuracy of automated EHR-based PEWS calculation (AutoPEWS) to manual calculation and evaluate the non-inferiority of AutoPEWS in predicting deterioration. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study inclusive of non-intensive care unit inpatients at a freestanding children's hospital over 4.5 months in Fall 2018. AutoPEWS mapped the historical manual PEWS scoring rubric to frequently used EHR documentation. We determined accuracy by comparing the expected respiratory subset score based on the current respiratory rate to the actual respiratory score of AutoPEWS and the manual PEWS. The agreement was determined using kappa statistics. We used predicted probabilities from a generalized linear mixed model to calculate areas under the curve for each combination of scores (AutoPEWS, manual) and deterioration outcome (rapid response team activation, unplanned intensive care unit transfer, critical deterioration event). We compared the adjusted difference in areas under the curves between the scores. Non-inferiority was defined as a difference of <0.05. Results: There were 23,514 total PEWS representative of 5,384 patients. AutoPEWS respiratory scores were 99.97% accurate, while the manual PEWS respiratory scores were 86% accurate. AutoPEWS were higher overall than the manual PEWS (mean 0.65 versus 0.34). They showed a fair-to-good agreement (weighted kappa 0.42 calculation in score accuracy by looking at the alignment between the patient's current respiratory rate and both the AutoPEWS and the manual PEWS respiratory subset scores. A secondary objective was to compare the ability of AutoPEWS and the manual PEWS to predict subsequent deterioration. We hypothesized that AutoPEWS would be more accurate than the manual PEWS without sacrificing predictive ability.",

Before this study, bedside nurses calculated the score manually using scoring rubric badge cards. They then entered the score into nursing flowsheets in our EHR. The score was calculated on all hospitalized children in non-ICU units at least every 4 hours. PEWS was initially used as a trigger for mandatory rapid response team (RRT) activation when it surpassed 4, but this trigger was removed in Fall 2017. At the time of this study, PEWS continued to be calculated on all hospitalized patients with no mandatory action based on a given score. Once manually entered into the EHR, the score was displayed prominently in the EHR in care-team facing locations as well as on the provider handoff tool. 16 A color gradient assisted in characterizing this PEWS value into low (<3), intermediate (3) (4) , and high risk (>4) groups.

We considered the actual respiratory subset score for the manual PEWS or AutoPEWS inaccurate if they were lower than the expected minimum score. We did not consider scores inaccurate if they were higher than the expected minimum score because the higher score could have been related to other PEWS inputs independent of respiratory rates such as levels of oxygen support or signs of difficulty breathing.

Accuracy of the manual PEWS and AutoPEWS were approximated by comparing their actual respiratory subset scores to the expected minimum respiratory subset scores based on the patient's respiratory rate at the time of data collection, as described above. The agreement was determined between the total manual PEWS and AutoPEWS-as well as each subset score-using weighted kappa statistics. We categorized kappa scores >0.75 as excellent agreement (beyond chance), scores <0.40 as poor agreement, and scores between 0.40 and 0.75 as fair-to-good agreement. 20 The prediction accuracy of the total manual PEWS and AutoPEWS was compared for all 4 deterioration outcomes (RRT activations, RRTs/code team activations, unplanned ICU transfers, and CDEs) via receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. Because we collected PEWS values once daily, we paired deterioration outcomes with PEWS if the outcome occurred within the 24 hours following data collection. To control for potential confounders and repeated measures for each outcome, we identified covariates for inclusion in a generalized linear mixed model (GLIMMIX). We identified age and gender a priori due to their clinical relevance and included admitting service and repeat event based on inclusion criteria (P < 0.2) from the bivariable analysis. Due to sample size limitations, there was no adjustment for any covariates in CDE analysis. The predicted probabilities from GLIMMIX were used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for each combination of PEWS and outcome. For each outcome, the manual PEWS ROC and the AutoPEWS ROCs were compared by taking the difference in AUC. We used an inferiority margin of 0.05 to determine non-inferiority, meaning AutoPEWS would be considered non-inferior to the manual PEWS if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the AUC difference between scores was >\u22120.05. 21, 22 Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 software (Cary, NC).

We hypothesize that many of the inaccuracies in the manual PEWS calculation occur in patients for whom the care-team has not yet developed concern. Because manual calculation is prone to human error, careteam members may be more likely to enter a low manual PEWS (eg, 0 or 1) without truly addressing the scoring rubric when they are not worried about a patient. This impression is supported by the lower mean total manual PEWS compared with AutoPEWS in our study population. Additionally, care-team members may be more likely to skip a calculation altogether when they are not worried about a patient, which is a possible explanation for the 2% of cases with missing manual PEWS values in our data.",

Team members, therefore, are at risk to miss subtle changes in clinical status that may have otherwise alerted the care-team of impending deterioration earlier in the process than they observed on their own. Similarly, when care-team members are worried about a patient, they may be more likely to document a more accurate and often higher PEWS, and they may even document a higher PEWS than the rubric would suggest, aligning the score with their level of worry. The primary issue with the behavior suggested by this hypothesis is that PEWS is meant to be a surveillance score to alert care-team members before they are worried to redirect attention to an at-risk patient before the care-team would otherwise be aware. If PEWS does not begin to rise until a careteam member becomes worried about the patient-and the score then becomes more accurate-it cannot fulfill its original purpose of rising before care-team awareness. Automation of the score within the EHR solves this problem by removing the care-team member from the calculation. A rising AutoPEWS-calculated by the EHR and displayed in a front-facing manner to the care-team-may alert the team that a patient about whom they were previously not concerned may warrant closer monitoring and assessment than otherwise would have been provided.",

As such, further caution is needed when using PEWS as a clinical decision tool to trigger interventions automatically. Additionally, steps should be taken to move toward leveraging available technologies to automate PEWS within EHRs rather than relying on manual calculation by care-team members.",

Though this is an important consideration, PEWS was not created as a tool to verify that a patient is deteriorating after the care-team has become concerned, but rather as a tool to alert the care-team that a patient is at risk for deterioration before team awareness that they should be concerned. Consequently, PEWS may not be the most efficient tool for quantifying a care-team member's \"worry\" and empowering him/her to speak up. We, therefore, feel the benefit of obtaining a more accurate score earlier in the process of deterioration through AutoPEWS calculation outweighs any benefit that may come from the correlation between the higher manual PEWS and care-team member worry. Other tools exist to quantify care-team member worry and facilitate assertion practices, and their implementation should be considered as part of a comprehensive care escalation system.",

Consequently, it is most appropriate to conclude that the manual PEWS calculation was inaccurate at least 14% of the time and that the true number is likely significantly higher.

Specifically, our analysis used patient age in months to determine normal respiratory rate ranges-and, therefore, expected respiratory subset scores-while the EHR used age in days within AutoPEWS.
