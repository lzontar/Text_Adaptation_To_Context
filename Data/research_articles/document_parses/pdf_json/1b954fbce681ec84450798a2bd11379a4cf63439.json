Hence, the infl uence of this limitation is likely minor. Studies have also shown that the highest incidence of KIP-yV/WUPyV infection occurs in children \u22481 year of age, slightly older than the children in our LRTI group (13) (14) (15) . The young age of the LRTI group may have resulted in a lower than expected positivity rate for this group. Second, all LRTI patients had nasopharyngeal aspirates taken; however, 68.7% of controls had provided nasopharyngeal aspirates. HBoV and KIPyV/WUPyV infections were more common in controls who had nasopharyngeal aspirate samples taken than in those who had throat swab samples taken (8/57 vs. 1/26). This difference in positivity for nasopharyngeal aspirates strengthens our conclusion that these viruses are not found more frequently in PICU children with LRTI.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 548, "end": 552, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 558, "end": 562, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Sampling errors make precise quantifi cation of viral loads diffi cult.

Ct values found in nasopharyngeal samples from patients in the control group were much higher, 32-39. A possible explanation for this difference is that high viral loads in the young LRTI population represent symptomatic primary infection, whereas the low viral load in the older controls might represent asymptomatic long-term shedding.
