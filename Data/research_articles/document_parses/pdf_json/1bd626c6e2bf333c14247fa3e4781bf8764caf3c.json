Although a self-limiting illness for most, the percentage of COVID-19 patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure requiring ICU admission for mechanical ventilation translates into large numbers which may challenge healtcare provision. In Northern Italy, an exponential increase in COVID-19 admissions rapidly overwhelmed normal ICU capacity [2] and surge capacity had to be created quickly. The exact reason for the sudden need for ICU surge capacity in Italy, and whether this will generalise to other countries, is unclear, but both demographic factors and healthcare system structure are likely to be important. Notably, UK availability of ICU beds per capita compares poorly with other highincome countries-including Italy [3] . Whilst standard acute wards may be re-purposed easily, creating ICU capacity is constrained by the need for complex equipment and the delivery of highly specialised medical and nursing care. Nevertheless, there are mechanisms by which ICU capacity could be increased in an emergency, including facilitating ICU discharge of recovering patients through liberating downstream beds by reducing elective work, by stopping elective work likely to require ICU admission, or by changing referral policies. Such changes are likely to be relatively quick to implement but have important repercussions for normal healthcare provision and ideally would not be instituted until absolutely necessary. Furthermore, since ICUs in the UK typically undertake a high proportion of emergency work, much of which will continue despite the pandemic, and since occupancy is typically well above 80%, such strategies are likely to result in only a relatively modest increase in capacity. A greater increase in emergency physical capacity for mechanical ventilation could be achieved by opening new level 3 beds with additional equipment (e.g. operating theatre ventilators). This requires significant changes to infrastructure, processes, or sta ng and is therefore logistically complex, expensive, and most importantly slow to implement. Forecasting was therefore essential in guiding such di cult policy decisions in Italy [2] . The explosion of cases seen in Italy means that an early warning of need for surge capacity is likely to be required in other countries including England.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 150, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 496, "end": 499, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 882, "end": 885, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2290, "end": 2293, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Epidemiological simulation has previously been successful in predicting the need for surge H1N1 ICU capacity in 2009 [4, 5] .

The fit is less reliable in the North East and Yorkshire, a region where we have separately confirmed the trend of observed new cases to have the weakest correlation with the other regions. The log-linear fit produces a strong R 2 value in populous areas, strengthening the argument for exponential growth in areas where the virus has gained a foothold.

Any flaw in our modelling assumptions can be considered as either rendering our model overly optimistic or pessimistic. Both have serious implications; optimism could cause detrimental delay in the development of surge capacity, whilst pessimism could cause substantial 'knock-on' morbidity (e.g. by prematurely cancelling elective work) as well as financial and system strain.

The most up-to-date information indicates a median length of stay of approximately 8 days, with a wide interquartile range and positive skew[13,14]. We modelled this with a gamma distribution (\u21b5 = 8, = 1).To link the expected daily incidence to the expected ICU bed occupancy due to COVID-19 we used a Monte Carlo simulation with 500 samples. This involved sampling from the daily incidence model, as well as the delay and length of stay distributions to obtain bed occupancy along with respective uncertainty estimates.
