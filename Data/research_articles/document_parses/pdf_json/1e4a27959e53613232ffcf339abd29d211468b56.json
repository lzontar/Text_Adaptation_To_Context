In particular, the strain-rate sensitivity of the mechanical properties of thermoplastic polymers is an important consideration for material selection in engineering applications related to load bearing and impact resistance capabilities. Deformation at slow strain rates of a viscoelastic material is analogous to that of viscous fluid, showing a proportional response between stress and strain. At fast strain rates, the deformation behavior is similar to that of a stiff or elastic 48th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 48 (Cancelled due to material. However, these extreme modes of deformation at different strain rates are idealized cases, and polymers typically exhibit a combination of both modes of deformation at a given strain rate [1] . Different mechanical models have been used to explain the viscoelastic behavior of polymers on the basis of Hooke's law, using combinations of elastic springs and dashpots. Two of the simplest models that use these concepts are the Maxwell model and Kelvin/Voight model. The Maxwell model attempts to explain viscoelasticity using a spring and dashpot connected in series, but this model can only express stress relaxation. On the other hand, the Voight model explains viscoelasticity in terms of a spring and dashpot connected in parallel, but this model can only express the creep behavior. The standard linear model is useful for explaining both stress relaxation and creep in a single model. It combines a spring in parallel with a Maxwell element. During stress relaxation, the isolated spring maintains original strain, whereas the Maxwell element is responsible for stress relaxation. During creep, there is an instantaneous response from the two springs as they are in parallel and can extend immediately. Although this model provides a decent approximation of the viscoelastic behavior of polymers, in practice, real polymers have various different stress relaxation mechanisms which require a lot of different elements for effective explanation of the behavior. One of the examples of models to explain the complicated behavior can be using multiple Maxwell elements in parallel, each of which have their own relaxation times, and the stress is equivalent to the sum of stresses in individual element [1] [2] [3] [4] . Recent models such as the elastic-viscoelastic-viscoplastic model [5] , and the Hyperelasto-Visco-Hysteresis (HVH) [6] [7] [8] take into consideration the influence of polymer chain conformations on the stress relaxation behavior at different strain rates. The stress relaxation is affected by a change in the proportions of various orientational and conformational states of the polymer molecules under applied stress [1, 4] . Such constitutive models of viscoelastic materials have been applied to predict the deformation behavior of polymer materials supported by experimental data from mechanical property tests of thermoplastic polymers. However, with the advent of polymer matrix composite materials composed of a wide variety of reinforcements and difference in manufacturing processes, there is now a need for a systematic study of strain-rate sensitivity of mechanical properties of such materials to gain insight into their viscoelastic behavior.",

In particular, polymer nanocomposite materials are attractive for such cases due to the enhancement of mechanical properties with a lower volume fraction of nanomaterials compared to larger scale reinforcements [9] [10] [11] . Additionally, the presence of reinforcements in the polymer matrix also modifies the viscoelastic properties of the polymer nanocomposite. The method of incorporation of nanomaterials into the polymer matrix and the resulting effect on the polymer chain structure will also affect the viscoelastic properties of the polymer. Mechanical stirring and ultrasonic processing of polymer solutions are two widely used approaches used to incorporate nanomaterials in liquid state processing of polymer matrix nanocomposites. The physical mechanisms involved in the mixing process can introduce changes in the molecular structure of the polymer chains [12] [13] [14] [15] . Additionally, the degree of dispersion and distribution of nanomaterials in the polymer matrix can also influence the mechanical behavior of the polymer under different loading conditions [16] [17] [18] .",

The geometric configuration of the ultrasonic processing cell was selected based on a computational model which predicted the best performance for acoustic cavitation and acoustic streaming. The geometrical configuration includes the depth of immersion of the ultrasonic probe, volume of liquid, and the size and shape of the ultrasonic processing cell. Details of the geometrical configuration selection are reported in our earlier works [19, 20] . The ultrasonic processing cell was constructed from a borosilicate glass tube with one end closed with a glass plate. The glass plate was sealed with a heat-resistant silicone-based adhesive. The ultrasonic processing cell was first filled with oxylene solvent, which was then heated to a temperature of 100\u00b0C on a hotplate. PP pellets were then introduced into the preheated solvent at a ratio of 1:10, and an ultrasonic probe (QSonica Q700, USA) was immersed into the ultrasonic processing cell. CNFs were then gradually introduced into the PP-xylene mixture at a concentration of 0.5% w/w, while the ultrasonic probe is active. The amplitude of the tip of the ultrasonic probe was maintained at 60 \u03bcm for a period of 30 minutes. The temperature of the mixture of PP and CNFs in oxylene was kept constant at 100\u00b0C throughout the ultrasonic processing step. Although ultrasonic processing is effective for mixing CNFs in the hot liquid PP solution, the state of dispersion and distribution of CNFs in the final PP-CNF sol nanocomposite solution can be changed upon its cooling and solidification. To mitigate this issue, the hot PP-CNF nanocomposite solution was quenched in a bath of cold water immediately after ultrasonic processing was completed. The remaining solvent and water was evaporated by prolonged heating at 100\u00b0C in a fume hood for a duration of 48 hours, after which a dry mass of solid PP-CNF nanocomposite was obtained. Neat PP was also prepared without the addition of CNFs using the same conditions described for ultrasonic processing. The solidified materials were cut into smaller pieces for use in subsequent injection molding.",

Typical stress-strain curves obtained for the neat PP specimens are shown in Fig. 2 . The corresponding average with standard deviation of tensile strength and elongation values are listed in Table 2 . The tensile strength of the neat PP polymer subjected to either of the processing methods showed an increase in their magnitude when compared to the original neat PP polymer. The change in mechanical behavior based on processing method of the original polymer can be attributed to the reorganization of filler materials present in the original polymer. Mineral-based fillers are typically added to commercial PP materials as a reinforcing agent to enhance their tensile strength and toughness. In order to verify the presence and type of filler in the PP matrix, FTIR analysis was conducted on the residue obtained from one of the TGA tests of the neat PP samples. The FTIR spectrum of this residue is shown in Fig.  3 . From this FTIR spectrum, three intense peaks can be observed at wavenumbers of 1795 cm -1 , 1412 cm -1 , and 875 cm -1 , which indicate the presence of the compound calcium carbonate (CaCO3). CaCO3 is typically treated with acrylic acid to enhance the dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix. The surface treatment of CaCO3 results in the formation of calcium acrylate, which can enhance the bonding between CaCO3 and the PP matrix. During processing of PP in the solvent o-xylene, the calcium acrylate is also dissolved along with PP in the solvent. In case of processing PP by mechanical stirring, it is possible that the dissolution of the calcium acrylate can negatively affect the interfacial bonding between the CaCO3 filler particles and the PP matrix. The dispersion and distribution of these filler particles can be affected by the processing method. In the case of neat PP processed by mechanical stirring, increased agglomeration of the filler can lead to a reduction in the ductility, as can be seen in the stressstrain curve for specimen PP2.",

The energy released during acoustic cavitation occurring in ultrasonic processing of polymers can cause scission of long polymer chains, leading to a reduction in the molecular weight of the polymer [36]. However, the ductility of specimen PP3 is similar to that of the original neat PP (specimen PP1). Compared to case of specimen PP2, this behavior can be attributed to achieving a better dispersion of the mineral fillers using ultrasonic processing. Free radicals formed due to chain scission during ultrasonic processing can act as sites for enhanced attraction toward the CaCO3 filler particles [16, 37] . The enhanced bonding strength between the filler particles and PP matrix, combined with the better dispersion is a potential reason for the retention of ductility in the ultrasonically processed specimens. The effect of polymer chain degradation due to processing of polymer is reflected in the polymer's thermal stability. The results of the TGA tests of all neat PP samples were subsequently analyzed.",

The corresponding average with standard deviation of tensile strength and elongation values of two different specimens prepared by ultrasonic processing, PP3 and PPNC2are listed in Table 4 . No dramatic changes in the mechanical properties of the polymer are evident. This behavior can be attributed to the relatively low volume fraction of CNFs in the PP matrix. However, there is a small increase in ductility in the PP-CNF nanocomposite, compared to the neat PP. This behavior can be attributed to the stronger interactions and improved adhesion in polymer structure. In order to observe whether the addition of CNFs into the PP matrix has an effect on the thermal stability of the polymer, TGA tests were conducted on these categories of samples. The corresponding TGA curves are shown in Fig.  5 . From the TGA curves of neat PP and PP-CNF nanocomposites both prepared using ultrasonic processing, a minor decrease in thermal stability is observed. The low volume fraction of CNFs in the PP matrix therefore does not pose a significant effect on the chain degradation of the polymer. Additionally, as shown in Table 5 , when compared to the PP-CNF nanocomposite processed by mechanical stirring, ultrasonically processed PP-CNF showed an increase in the characteristic degradation temperatures, which indicated higher thermal stability. Based on the advantages presented by ultrasonic processing in terms of reduced processing time, higher mixing efficiency, and higher thermal stability, ultrasonic processing can be considered as a feasible method for preparation of PP-CNF nanocomposites.

As the strain rate decreases, polymer chains are prone to the stress relaxation near fiber ends, which induces easiler deformation showing lower tensile strength with higher ductility.",

            "text": "The strain-rate dependent deformation behavior of PP and PP-CNF nanocomposites has a strong relationship with the stress relaxation processes occurring in the polymer chains under applied loads. For a semi-crystalline polymer, the process for stress relaxation involves two relaxation processes, one in the crystallites and the other in the amorphous zone [1] . Stress relaxation occurs by chain movement through the crystallites which causes an additional shearing in the amorphous zone. As the yielding behavior of the polymer is dependent on its specific stress relaxation processes, an increase in the strain rate leads to a reduction in the ductility of the polymer. Yielding behavior of the polymer is affected by the ratio of the applied strain rates to the respective relaxation processes of the polymer, and, as this ratio increases, i.e. as the strain increases, the restriction to plastic flow increases in the polymer which leads to a brittleness in the polymer. As the restriction to plastic flow increases with an increase in the strain rate, the stress also increases as a response to this restriction of the plastic flow. As the plastic flow experiences a restriction, the molecules become capable of handling higher loads leading to further increase in stress.",

PP tensile test specimens have been manufactured through the ultrasonic processing and injection-molded following the standard ASTM D638-14. Compared to the mechanically-stirred PPs, ultrasonicallyprocessed PPs retain their ductility similar to the neat PP, and there is a significant reduction in the preparation time. Their thermal behavior studied using TGA shows that there is only a little change in the degradation temperature, indicating that the ultrasonic processing is relatively more efficient and effective processing method compared to mechanical stirring for preparation of the polymer and its nanocomposite.",

At higher strain rates, CNFs added in the matrix restrict the polymer molecule flowing and stress relaxation near them, inducing more efficiency in load transferring, which results in higher tensile strength, showing lower ductility. , but its ductility is still remained Future investigations related to this work include the study of the effect of variation in the volume fraction of CNFs on the strain-rate sensitivity and thermal stability of the polymer. Additionally, the influence of processing method and addition of nanofibers on crystallinity of the polymer matrix will be studied. Microstructural analysis of the polymer matrix will also be performed to observe the effect of the polymer processing method on the degree of dispersion and dispersion of the CNFs in the polymer matrix. Higher levels of strain rates up to 10 4 s -1 will be performed in order to gain further understanding of the strain-rate sensitivity.",
