Design Analysis of longitudinal records between 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2018. setting UK primary care database: 'The Health Improvement Network' (THIN). Participants 11 831 850 eligible patients from 787 contributing practices. Childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse (women only) were defined as the presence of a recorded Read code. Outcome measures The incidence rate (IR) and prevalence of childhood maltreatment (in children aged 0-18 years) and domestic abuse (in women aged over 18) between 1996 and 2017. An adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) is given to examine the differences in IRs based on sex, ethnicity and deprivation. results The age and gender breakdown of THIN has been previously reported to be representative of the UK population, however, there is substantial missing information on deprivation quintiles (<20%) and ethnicity (approximately 50%). The IR (IR 60.1; 95% CI 54.3 to 66.0 per 100 000 child years) and prevalence (416.1; 95% CI 401.3 to 430.9 per 100 000 child population) of childhood maltreatment rose until 2017. The aIRR was greater in patients from the most deprived backgrounds (aIRR 5.14; 95% CI 4.57 to 5.77 compared with least deprived) and from an ethnic minority community (eg, black aIRR 1.25; 1.04 to 1.49 compared with white). When examining domestic abuse in women, in 2017, the IR was 34.5 (31.4 to 37.7) per 100 000 adult years and prevalence 368.7 (358.7 to 378.7) per 100 000 adult population. Similarly, the IR was highest in the lowest socioeconomic class (aIRR 2.30; 2.71 to 3.30) and in ethnic minorities (South Asian aIRR 2.14; 1.92 to 2.39 and black aIRR 1.64; 1.42 to 1.89). Conclusion Despite recent improvements in recording, there is still a substantial under-recording of maltreatment and abuse within UK primary care records, compared with currently existing sources of childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse data. Approaches must be implemented to improve recording and detection of childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse within medical records.",

            "text": "as their secondary consequences. 13 In order to support a public health approach, high quality data recording relating to these exposures plays an important role. 13 Exploring the role of routinely collected data (which due its repeatable nature can be used for surveillance) in the UK as well as other countries is crucial in both the estimation of the societal burden of disease as well as the identification of risk and protective factors. 14 Exposure to domestic abuse and childhood maltreatment remain taboo topics in many cultures, despite the adverse consequences in terms of health and well-being, with significant stigma around disclosure of traumatic events. 15 16 As a result, survivors of such traumatic experiences often find it difficult to attend and seek support from public sector authorities such as healthcare staff. 17 18 There are also challenges for healthcare staff to routinely enquire or ask about such experiences in their patients' lives. 19 The combination of barriers to disclosure and enquiry are likely to lead to a hidden burden of domestic abuse and childhood maltreatment not captured in administrative public sector data. However, since introductions of new guidelines in the UK (National Institute of Health and Care Excellence in 2016 and 2017), the hope has been that administrative recording will have improved. 20 21 This drive towards improved reporting is spurred on by UK media and governmental interest in these topics (high profile events leading to media and governmental interest include: the death of Baby P, the Jimmy Savile inquiry, Operation Yewtree, the death of Daniel Pelka, the identification and referral to improve safety trial and the consideration of the domestic abuse bill), and the consequent expectation that administrative recording will have improved. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Current UK national estimates of domestic abuse are largely derived from self-reported surveys in conjunction with administrative data. The crime survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides self-reported information and used in conjunction with police records of the number of recorded domestic abuse incidents to define epidemiological estimates of domestic abuse. In women, the reported prevalence from the CSEW (for those aged 16-59 years old) was 7.9% in the financial year 2017/2018 while the crude estimate derived from police data for the year ending 2017 (not yet available for 2018 for those aged 16 and over) across England was 24.0/1000 population (in men and women). 27 28 Unfortunately, the use of alternative administrative records pertaining to information on domestic abuse are limited to recording processes such as hospital records. There is no specific international classification of disease code that are specific to domestic abuse: The closest matches are T74.1 (physical abuse, confirmed), Y07.0 (spouse or partner, perpetrator of maltreatment and neglect) and Z63.0 (and problems in a relationship with spouse or partner) which when specified in adults relate to physical abuse, maltreatment. 29 However, there are substantial limitations to utilising these codes to describe the epidemiology of domestic abuse, due to low numbers of such codes being recorded and also ambiguities in coding practice between hospital trusts. 29 The state of epidemiological estimates when exploring childhood maltreatment suffers from similar challenges. A recent observational study used data from 1858 to 2016 that was derived from child mortality records, police recorded-homicides, crimes against children, child protection data, children in care and data taken from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) to study long term trends of child maltreatment. The study found a decreasing long-term trend in child maltreatment until the year 2000 but reported an increase thereafter. 30 However, child mortality continued to decrease. 30 A recommendation of the report was to further research and establish whether child maltreatment is continuing to increase. 30 However, once again when taken from the CSEW, the estimated prevalence of experiencing childhood maltreatment was 18.9% (financial year end 2016). 31 The information relating to the incidence rate (IR) for those at risk of childhood maltreatment or domestic abuse is low. One approach to attempt to do so is to use records taken from general practice (GP). A previous study using GP recorded data between 1995 and 2010 explored the IRs and prevalence of childhood maltreatment-related concerns (includes information relating to suspected and possible maltreatment) and identified an increase in incidence and prevalence of maltreatment related concerns between this time. 32 In summary, the limitations of existing estimates relate to challenges with: (1) continuous recording of survey data to allow for active surveillance and examination of trends; (2) social desirability bias 33 leading to an underestimation in survey estimates; (3) selection bias 34 leading to an under-estimation in administrative datasets and (4) an appropriate denominator population to describe prevalence in administrative data.",

Additionally, there is debate about whether children living in a household where there is domestic abuse overlaps with the definition of child maltreatment as a form of adverse childhood experience (ACEs). 42 Therefore, to avoid confusion in definition between childhood maltreatment and experiencing ACEs which include other markers of household adversity, we have restricted our domestic abuse population to only those over the age of 18 years. statistical analysis and follow up For annual point prevalence, the numerator was the cumulative count of eligible individuals with any record of domestic abuse (occurred over 18 years) or childhood maltreatment (occurred under 18 years) identified at the 1 January each year from 1996 to 2017 who were then divided by the total eligible population on the same date (denominator).

Additionally, the prevalence of both childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse continued to increase in a linear fashion until 2017. Of interest there were similar patterns of risk in both groups. For both childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse, there was a substantially increased aIRR seen in those from a more deprived background when compared with the least deprived, and a greater IR of new cases of both childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse in those from an ethnic minority background despite taking into account other co-variates. The IR was also highest in the 0-1 year group and in females for childhood maltreatment and the 18-24 years group for those experiencing domestic abuse. The most notable finding is the high level of under-recording of childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse in the dataset in comparison to those reported in self-reported surveys including the CSEW and NSPCC survey.",

            "text": "Comparison to current literature As this was the first cohort to the authors' knowledge to explore the annual incidence and prevalence of domestic abuse (in women) using UK primary care records, it is difficult to compare the IRs directly with other studies. However, for childhood maltreatment, one previous study (including data from 1995 to 2010) reported the IR of childhood maltreatment related concerns using THIN. 32 The maltreatment-related concern codes included cases of suspected or probable maltreatment which would explain why their documented IR and prevalence are substantially higher than those reported in our study. 32 However, of note in that study they demonstrated an increased IR of childhood maltreatment related concerns in those in the under one group, those who are female and almost a five times increased risk in those from the most deprived group when compared with the lowest group, all of which are similar to our findings. 32 Of particular note, a key finding of our study was the prevalence and IR were much lower than estimates derived from currently existing sources of childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse epidemiology. When examining UK police reports of domestic abuse, although for both genders, the prevalence in England was 24.0 per 1000 population, much higher than in our study even though we only included a female denominator population. 27 When compared with the CSEW data which showed a prevalence of 7.9% in women, our figure seems even lower. 28 Similarly, although no combined child maltreatment figure exists for police reports, if we examine the estimated prevalence from the CSEW which suggested 18.9% of all adults have experienced some form of childhood maltreatment our figure of 4.2 per 1000 population (2017) is substantially lower. 31 When compared with other administrative data such as children in need data, which contains the rate of children on Child protection plans, GP recorded prevalence still remains low, which has also been shown in previous literature on maltreatment-related concerns. 32 45 The low values of incidence and prevalence of childhood maltreatment and domestic abuse and other interesting findings resonate and build on known literature. There have been national policy reports highlighting inconsistencies in data collected relating domestic abuse and childhood maltreatment to poverty and ethnicity. 46 47 However, we clearly demonstrate a linear relationship between IR and socioeconomic deprivation following adjustment for ethnicity. When adjusting for deprivation, GP data still highlights the burden of maltreatment and abuse experienced in ethnic minorities (although South Asians were not at a higher risk of childhood maltreatment, and mixed raced individuals were not at a higher risk of either childhood maltreatment or domestic abuse). It has been previously highlighted that black and minority ethnic children are over-represented in child protection records within the UK, but this may be related to poverty (a form of which we have been able to adjust for in our study), isolation and willingness to seek help due to stigma in some communities. 48 In contrast to our findings, the prevalence reported for domestic abuse exposure CSEW was highest in those from a mixed race Open access background, and lower in those from the South Asian, black or other community. 28 There are clear messages that need to be taken from this study relating to the under-recording of domestic abuse and childhood maltreatment in GP records. Although approaches and intervention have been implemented and evaluated to record both of these traumatic experiences, more needs to be done. 26 36 Healthcare professionals should be aware of the morbidity burden caused by such exposures and also the referral tools at their disposal highlighted in recent national guidelines. 20 21 Attempts to overcome barriers in asking about domestic abuse and childhood maltreatment such as the use of short question proformas are options to be trialled more broadly. 49 Although recording of domestic abuse and childhood maltreatment do not yet fall under the incentivised payment system for GPs, it should be strongly encouraged to improve our recording and implementation of appropriate referral mechanisms. 50 Although this study was unable to explore the reasons for underrecording by GPs, there is substantial literature on reasons for the under-recording and under-reporting of maltreatment and abuse summarised in a recent review. 51 Factors refer to either challenges in the recognition or reporting of maltreatment and abuse. Variables which may affect recognition include experience and knowledge levels of the treating clinician or variation in the threshold between clinicians as to what is reasonable suspicion of maltreatment or abuse. 51 52 Additionally, factors which affect the clinician reporting the maltreatment or abuse include: (1) knowledge of the family; (2) expected negative outcomes of reporting to child-protection services;",

Although this study was not designed to assess the impact of public policy or media attention at certain time points, it is also possible that spikes in IR seen in the dataset such as in 2012-2013 in the childhood maltreatment cohort may be related to high profile news events such as the exposure of Jimmy Savile which was shown to result in an increase of reports of childhood maltreatment to UK statutory bodies. 53 Additionally, as time progress, it may be possible to conduct an interrupted time series analysis to assess the impact of changes in the NICE guidance and whether this has led to improved recording and reporting.",
