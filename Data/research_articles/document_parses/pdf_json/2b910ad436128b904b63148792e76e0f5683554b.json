            "text": "There has been considerable public debate about whether the economic impact of the current COVID19 restrictions are worth the costs. Although the potential impact of COVID19 has been modelled extensively, very few numbers have been presented in the discussions about potential economic impacts. For a good answer to the question \"will the restrictions cause as much harm as COVID19?\" credible evidence-based estimates are required, rather than simply rhetoric 1 . Here we provide some preliminary estimates to compare the impact of the current restrictions against the direct impact of the virus. Since most countries are currently taking an approach that reduces the number of COVID19 deaths, the estimates we provide for deaths from COVID19 are deliberately taken from the low end of the estimates of the infection fatality rate 2 , while estimates for deaths from an economic recession are deliberately computed from double the high end of confidence interval for severe economic recessions. This ensures that an adequate challenge to the status quo of the current restrictions is provided. Our analysis shows that strict restrictions to eradicate the virus are likely to lead to at least eight times fewer total deaths than an immediate return to work scenario.",

It is worth noting that despite our intuition and some evidence for the link between unemployment and suicide, the link is not confirmed across the scientific literature. At least one large scale analysis suggests the association between increased unemployment rates and suicide is not statistically significant in most models and samples, so the evidence for an increase in suicides from an increased unemployment rate is not conclusive 6 .",

Meta-analyses show that prolonged severe loneliness can increase all-cause mortality by 15-29% 8 , 9 . It should be noted that this statistic comes from research examining severe and chronic loneliness, often associated with other factors such as depression, which also increases mortality rates. Very little research has looked at the effect of temporary increases in loneliness due to a situation like the current pandemic restrictions. Preliminary research from Poland suggests that in the first week of the COVID19 restrictions, only 6% reported spending the week alone (despite 80-90% compliance) and those who reported compliance with the restriction measures only reported a slight increase in loneliness compared to those who did not 10 . A recent review on the effects of quarantine suggests an increase in the number of people showing psychological distress by approximately 20% across multiple studies and measures, so we have used this higher value (even though quarantine due to contact with someone who is infected is likely to be more distressing than the population wide restrictions) 11 . We conservatively assumed severe restrictions continue for six months and used the estimate that 20% of Australians will experience loneliness during the restriction period. When multiplied by a 22% increase in the typical mortality rate per year (0.73%) for that 20% of the population (over six months) our calculations suggest up to 4,015 more deaths (with all these values probably reflecting very high estimates given the caveats listed above).",

However, to provide a challenge to the status quo of restrictions, we have assumed it will take 10 years for unemployment levels to return to pre-COVID19 levels. To calculate the effect of this on the number of suicides, we calculated an estimate based on an increase by 16.48% in suicides (double the upper range of the 95% confidence interval for the 5% of the most severe recessions in Europe over a 40-year period 4 ). As unemployment returns to the usual 5% over a 10-year period, we assume the suicide rate will decline proportionally across that time period. This pessimistic scenario would result in around 2,761 additional deaths from suicide over the ten-year period.",

If restrictions are lifted immediately, there will still be some individual reactions and government measures that will continue, which would not be otherwise be present in our typical economy. As such, for the sake of comparison, we have assumed that lifting restrictions immediately would mean the recession will result in half as many jobs lost (an increase from the current 5% unemployment rate to 10%, rather than the 15% we have assumed if restrictions continue).

Evidence from the 1918 Spanish flu even suggests that cities that administered more severe restrictions during the pandemic had economies that bounced back faster after the pandemic than cities that did not administer severe restrictions 19 . This suggests that continued restrictions might benefit us both in terms of reducing the spread of COVID19 and reducing its impact on the economy.

As such, the rate of fatalities per infection is likely to be lower than the rate used in the Australian government modelling 20 and the UK modelling 21 . We used the lower rate of fatalities per infection to be prudent (given the substantial range in estimates of the fatality rate per infection throughout the current literature). Using the lower estimate also provides the strongest challenge to the status quo of the current restrictions. We provide estimates for three different scenarios. Immediate return to work (which has been proposed by some to reduce the damage to the economy), Herd Immunity (reduced restrictions to allow increased economic function but still allow coronavirus spread to slowly spread until enough people are infected that the virus is limited by herd immunity), and Eradication (restrictions are maintained until the virus is completely contained, then extensive track and trace to completely eliminate the virus).",

In particular, young people are more likely to be affected by a recession 34 . Young people are also currently adhering to restrictions despite being at lower risk from COVID19.

This is twice the number of deaths predicted for Herd Immunity and eight times as many as Eradication. It is worth noting that Sweden (which is applying looser restrictions than most countries and discussing herd immunity as the outcome), has already reported more deaths from COVID19 than the number of deaths we have estimated due to unemployment related suicide and loneliness (on a per capita basis). Perhaps this is why over 252 economists recently signed a letter recommending against loosening restrictions to benefit the economy 18 .",
