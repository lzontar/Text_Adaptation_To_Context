With a bit of planning, audiences from all over the world can tune in from the comfort of the office or even home at a convenient time, to attend and learn from eminent experts from across the five continents. This may require a strict scheduling in a diary. It may even require locking an office from the inside to prevent being disturbed.

Young physicians would less frequently have an opportunity to network with established scientists. Established scientists would not as easily be able to network with and possibly recruit young talent. Certainly, the economic effects of a reduction of the rate of travel-even if just in medicine-would be felt throughout all of the economy as hotels, restaurants, airlines, and airports and all ancillary industries would suffer the loss and would require staff to find other lines of work (perhaps, e.g., in overstretched sectors such as healthcare?).",

While there may also be an argument for the ecological benefit of the reduction of travel, most of us in nuclear medicine will not have the level of ecological or climatological expertise to contribute with a thorough, fact-based argumentation on this aspect of the debate, regardless of which side of the ideological spectrum one is on. What we can do as physicians is oversee the medical implications of the quick spread of potentially deadly diseases. We saw the Covid-19 crisis unfold before our eyes. We see that in regions of the world previously estimated to have excellent healthcare, the system is under the stress of the sheer number of new infections in a few short weeks. We see that in order to save lives, to save time, which can be used to save lives, the spread of contagious diseases must be limited. As for any responsible physician, the saving of lives should be paramount to any personal preferences regarding travelling or economic factors, the argument for the reduction of professional travelling should really be a \"no-brainer\".",

However, nuclear medicine ever since its inception has been at the very forefront of new developments. Nuclear medicine practiced theragnostics for over half a century before this buzzword was invented around the turn of the millennium. A variety of imaging principles and techniques, which have later been adapted by, e.g. radiologists, found their origin in nuclear medicine such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Nuclear medicine physicians are technology minded, open for new developments and can usually be interested in anything that makes personal life more pleasant and more compatible with work. Hence, nuclear medicine is excellently suited to also fulfil and eminent role in science and education away from traditional patterns into the twenty-first century.",
