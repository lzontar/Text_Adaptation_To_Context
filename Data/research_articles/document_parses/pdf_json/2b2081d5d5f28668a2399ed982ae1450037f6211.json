Tianjin, one of the largest cities in China and a northern economic center, owns a population of over 15 million and a population density of almost 1, 000 people per square kilometer. As of Mar 13, 2020, 136 COVID-19 cases including three deaths were reported in Tianjin. Among them, there were 36 asymptomatic cases (26.47%). Most of these asymptomatic cases were identified from screening close contacts of COVID-19 patients. Of note, the asymptomatic cases reported in this study were found on the date of testing, but some cases may develop symptoms during the disease course and should be recategorized as the presymptomatic or symptomatic cases. 10 11 Thus, the proportion of the asymptomatic cases in our study might be overestimated. To date, the exact proportion of the asymptomatic cases is not fully explored. An estimated asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CI 15.5-20.2%) was reported in the Diamond Princess Cruise ship. 12 What is surprising is that 16 cases were finally confirmed based on at least three times nucleic acid detection. In line with our result, a previous study reported that nine COVID-19 cases were unconfirmed until a third-time nucleic acid detection. 13 17 Moreover, a positive result of SARS-Cov-2 in samples from air outlet fans was also observed, suggesting that small virus-laden droplets might be displaced by airflows and deposited on some equipment such as vents. 18 Given this, airborne transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is possible when virus-laden droplets might not be displaced by airflows quickly in a poorly ventilated place. 19 Furthermore, human coronaviruses such as SARS-Cov-1, MERS-Cov could persist on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days. 20 Meanwhile, SARS-Cov-2 was also found on inanimate surfaces like a door handle, cell phone, and window bench when environmental surveillance performed in confirmed COVID-19 cases, indicating that the indirect contact was another route of transmission for COVID-19. 21, 22 Therefore, the indirect contact transmission and potential airborne transmission could be possible contributors to the large-scale common-source outbreak of COVID-9 in this department store. Recently, a similar large-scale common-source outbreak of COVID-9 that happened in the poorly ventilated public place such as a shopping mall and a church was also reported. 23, 24 This meaningful case series is of great warning significance for other cities where large-scale local transmission has not yet happened in a poorly ventilated public place. In addition, the finding also further emphasizes the significance of taking basic protective measures (e.g. hand hygiene and maintaining social distance or using masks) when visiting a public place. A similar pattern did not emerge again as a strict isolation policy had been implemented since Jan 24, 2020 in Tianjin.

This phenomenon presented a serious threat to public health because of the difficulty to process a strict isolation among family members. Importantly, to interrupt household transmission as early as possible, individuals living with family members suffering COVID-19 infection should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection, even if they did not have any symptoms. 25 It was interesting to note that the disease severity in imported cases was more serious than that in other cases. In line with our finding, it had been reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 cases in Zhejiang Province were relatively mild compared with cases initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan. 30 Moreover, as of Mar 13, 2020 , the mortality of COVID-19 in the other part of China outside of Wuhan (2.04%) was far lower than that in Wuhan (4.89%), and especially lower in areas outside of Hubei Province (0.90%). 31 Furthermore, it was reported that the viral load of SARS-Cov-2 gradually decreased in tertiary patients. 32 Accordingly, we inferred that the pathogenicity of SARS-Cov-2 might decrease when transmitted to the next generation in China.

In the early stage (before Jan 27, 2020), most of confirmed cases were imported cases. Meanwhile, the peak of imported cases appeared on Jan 26, 2020, and then the number of imported cases decreased gradually. The number of cases linked to the Baodi department store increased gradually since Jan 21, 2020, and peaked on Feb 2, 2020. Thus, the second stage of the COVID-19 outbreak mainly included cases linked to the Baodi department store. According to this epidemic curve, it was considered as a large-scale common-source outbreak of COVID-19. Other cases of local transmission occurred at the same time as cases linked to the Baodi department store. With the decrease of the number of cases linked to the Baodi Department store, they gradually increased and peaked on Feb 10, representing the main transmission pattern in the late stage, which was considered as a propagated epidemic due to this epidemic curve. 2.4 Transmission chains of 43 COVID-19 cases linked to the Baodi department store in Tianjin The transmission chains of 43 COVID-19 cases linked to the Baodi department store in Tianjin are shown in Figure 2. According to the official epidemiological investigation, a saleswoman in the Baodi department store might be the index patient,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "This result may be partly explained by the fact of false-negative happened in virus nucleic acid detection. Forinstance, recent evidence demonstrated that the positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for COVID-19 was only 47.4% in suspect patients. 14 Hence, the problem of false-negative of RT-PCR for COVID-19 is a challenge to control the spread of the disease. Fortunately, some advancement had been achieved in this field, such as rapid IgM-IgG combined antibody test and a combination of nucleic acid detection and chest CT examination.15,16 To date, the transmission pattern of the COVID-19 outbreak in the well-developed cities is still not clear. In the early stages of an outbreak in Tianjin, the most of confirmed cases were imported cases and their close contacts. Our results suggested that Wuhan was not the only source of the imported cases in Tianjin, and about one-third of the total imported cases were from areas outside of Wuhan,especially like other cities in Hubei Province. This finding indicated that the local transmission in other cities of Hubei Province might be far earlier than that in cities outside of Hubei. In the late stage, the local transmission largely occurred within Tianjin, and the poorly ventilated public place had become an important transfer station for virus transmission. The Poorly ventilated public place including large supermarkets, major department stores, places of worship, and nightclubs, is usually crowded and suffering a weak circulation of fresh air. All these characteristics determine it as a high-risk place for SARS-Cov-2 transmission. In this study, a total of 43 cases were found an epidemiological link to the Baodi department store, indicating that a large-scale common-source outbreak of COVID-9 occurred in a typical poorly ventilated public place. It is easy to be infected with the virus if people have unprotected contact with the COVID-19 case in such a place. To our knowledge, droplets and fomites during close unprotected contact are the main transmission routes of COVID-19. However, the exact transmission routes in this department store were not very clear. Whether COVID-19 can also be transmitted by the airborne route is unconfirmed. Importantly, recent evidences had shown that both SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov-1 exhibited a similar half-live in aerosols with median estimates around 2.7 hours.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "COVID-19 was a mixture of the propagated epidemic and the common-source outbreak in Tianjin. Local transmission of COVID-19 mainly occurred within families and a poorly ventilated public place in Tianjin. To interrupt household transmission as early as possible, an active screening to prompt SARS-Cov-2 testing in individuals with family members suffering SARS-Cov-2 infection should be considered seriously. Besides, it was necessary to implement effective measures to prevent the large-scale spread of COVID-19 in poorly ventilated public places at the early stage of an outbreak. In view of local transmissions observed in a growing number of countries, our findings might offer several valuable information to support other countries to control a potential future spread of nationwide epidemics.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Figure legends", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "Figure 1 Epidemic curves of 136 COVID-19 Cases with different infection sources in", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Transmission chains of 43 COVID-19 cases linked to the Baodi department store in Tianjin A saleswoman was suspected to be the index patient, and other six saleswomen were suspected to be infected by this woman.
