The approaches to translational genomics can be broadly grouped into two methodologies, forward and reverse genomic translation. Traditional (forward) genomic translation begins with model systems and aims at using unbiased genetic associations in these models to derive insight into biological mechanisms that may also be relevant in human disease. Reverse genomic translation begins with observations made through human genomic studies and refines these observations through follow-up studies using model systems. The ultimate goal of these approaches is to clarify intervenable processes as targets for therapeutic development.",

For instance, the human applicability of genomic studies of the response to traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a mouse model require that the mouse's response to TBI is analogous to a human's, and that the approach taken to Pavlos Myserlis and Farid Radmanesh contributed equally to this work. create a TBI in the mouse provokes a similar pattern of injury seen in human TBI (6) (7) (8) (9) . As such, a great deal of careful work is required to demonstrate the validity of these model systems before the results arising from them can be judged relevant to human disease. The challenges of bridging this divide are illustrated by the universal failure of neuroprotection mechanisms that reached human trials in the last several decades, essentially all of which had promising model system data in preclinical development (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) .",

As such, there are few concerns as to the relevance of the system for discovery of biomarkers and mechanisms of disease. However, this approach carries a new series of challenges in study design and data acquisition (4) . Compared to isogenic cell lines or carefully bred animals in a controlled setting, humans are highly variable in both their environmental and genetic exposures. This is advantageous in identifying genetic susceptibility to disease risk and outcomes, but teasing out these small genetic effects from highly variable non-genetic exposures requires both careful computational techniques as well as large sample sizes. Furthermore, because genomic data is both identifiable and can potentially lead to discrimination, human genomic studies require complex consent and data management procedures (15) . In neurocritical care, the relative rarity of many of the diseases we encounter, coupled with the challenges of critical illness and surrogate consent make human genomic studies all the more difficult to execute effectively (16) (17) (18) (19) .",

The International HapMap Consortium obtained genotypes on individuals across 11 ancestral populations around the globe, creating a resource that described the patterns of allele frequency variation across diverse populations (32) . With these breakthroughs and a number of landmark evolutions that followed, case/control and population-based GWAS have led to the identification of over 11,000 associations with human diseases and other traits (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). Obviously there is an enormous disconnect between the discovery of genetic loci and leveraging of this information for human benefit, which is where the translational genomic work that serves as the topic of the present review becomes relevant (32) .",

Using these approaches, each nucleotide in the exome or genome is ascertained with high reliability, permitting the identification of rare and de novo variants that escape detection in traditional GWAS (33) . WES captures within-gene coding variation only, offering detection of variants that may more directly impact protein structure and function than non-coding variation detected by WGS (34) . Because the coding exome is only~2% of the overall genome, it is more cost-effective than WGS, but debate continues as to which is the more appropriate tool for large-scale study of the human genome (35) . Regardless, both WES and WGS remain orders of magnitude more expensive than traditional GWAS approaches at this time, and as such well-powered sequencing studies remain unreachable for many diseases in the current pricing models. Less common diseases and conditions that one may find in a neurocritical care unit are doubly disadvantaged, as even larger sample sizes are required for sequencing analyses than GWAS, due to the need for many observations to identify rare exonic or intronic variants associated with disease (17, 36) . As pricing models improve and larger and larger community or hospital-based cohorts receive sequencing through clinical or biobanking efforts, it is hoped that even uncommon conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or status epilepticus will benefit from the insights achievable through sequencing analysis, where case/control and smaller sequencing studies have shown promise (37, 38) .",

            "text": "Obviously genomic research need not be limited solely to human studies. A wealth of information about disease pathogenesis and response to injury can be gleaned from model systems of human conditions using genomic and transcriptomic approaches. Because animal models and isogenic tissue cultures are specifically designed to limit genetic differences between individual animals or plated cells, DNA-based association tests typically do not offer insight in the same way that they do in humans. As such, many model system studies start with RNA, examining how the genome responds to perturbation through the transcriptome. However, there are substantial genomic differences between model systems and humans, as coding sequences are not necessarily conserved, promoter and enhancer control of gene expression can vary, and in the case of immortalized tissue and cell-based assays, the chromosomal architecture itself can be quite different from the organism from which it was derived (39, 40) . These differences can be highly relevant when determining whether observed transcriptomic and proteomic results from model systems are likely to be shared in humans. With those caveats, the dynamic nature of the transcriptome in model systems offers opportunities to assess the way in which the genome responds to noxious insults or drug exposures, and in animal models this can even be done across specific organs or tissues of interest (40) . As one example, traumatic brain injury researchers have obtained insight into both the initial injury cascade as well as brain response to potential injury modulators such as valproate using animal models and transcriptional microarrays, in which RNA expression patterns in brain tissue can be rapidly and replicably assessed across the transcriptome (41) . Using more recent technological advancements such as Drop-seq, RNA expression can be assessed in single cells, as has been done in individual hippocampal neurons in a mouse model of TBI (42) . At a minimum, these elegant studies can help to identify relevant cell types important in the response to injury, highlighting testable hypotheses that may be important in human conditions, all with access to tissues and control over experimental conditions that would never be possible in human-based research. Given that diseases common to the neurocritical care population so rarely afford access to brain tissue for pathologic or genomic analysis antemortem, model system genomic studies offer an important adjunct for translational research.",

Currently, hemicraniectomy is the only available option to prevent death and yet it does not address the underlying pathophysiology. Hyperosmolar therapy is potentially useful as a bridge to surgery. Preclinical data based on a forward translation approach has been useful in highlighting mechanisms underlying postinfarct edema as potential targets for therapeutic manipulation. The sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) is encoded by the ABCC8 gene that is upregulated after CNS injury, forming an ion channel in association with transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM4). Continuous activation of this complex can lead to cytotoxic edema and neuronal cell death, which has been demonstrated in both animal and human models (44, 45) . SUR1 is also found in pancreatic beta cells, constituting the target for the oral hypoglycemic agent, glyburide. Studies of rodent and porcine stroke models demonstrated that in the first few hours after an ischemic insult, both SUR1 and TRPM4 are upregulated (46, 47) . Limited case series of human postmortem specimens also demonstrated upregulation of SUR1 in infarcted tissue (48) . Therefore, intravenous glyburide has been proposed for treatment of malignant cerebral edema. Targeting Sur1 in rat models of ischemia have consistently resulted in reduced edema and better outcomes (49) . In particular, glyburide infusion starting 6 h after complete middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in decreased swelling by two thirds and 5% reduction in mortality (50) .",

Differences in brain structure, including geometry, craniospinal angle, gyral complexity, and white-gray matter ratio, particularly in the rodent models, can result in different responses to trauma (65) . The limitation of extrapolating animal studies to human is also manifested at the genetic level, as differences in gene structure, function, and expression levels may suggest genetic mechanisms that are incompletely correlated with humans. As an example, female sex may be associated with better outcome through the neuroprotective effect of progesterone in animal models, but these observations did not carry over to humans in the ProTECT-III trial (67, 68) . Variable outcome measures, including neurobehavioral functional tests, Glasgow outcome scale correlates, and high-resolution MRI have been used in attempts to correlate animal responses to injury with those of humans. The lack of a large cache of standardized tools further limits comparison or pooling the results of different studies that use variable models of TBI or outcome measurement.",

Gene ontology analysis at 3 months post-TBI have shown similar changes, with upregulation of inflammatory and immune-related genes (69) . Importantly, late downregulation of ion channel expression in the peri-lesional cortex and thalamus suggests that this delayed examination of the transcriptome could be valuable for revealing mechanisms relevant to chronic TBI morbidities, including epileptogenesis and prolonged cognitive impairment (70) .

In addition, 9-31% of patients with SE develop refractory SE when they fail to respond to first-and second-line therapy, posing a significant management and prognostic challenge (72) .

In addition to being an end-measure and therefore precluding measurements at different time points in the same animal, varying degrees of tissue desiccation among samples may yield numbers different from actual in vivo values.

However, translational research using many of the above models has demonstrated that endothelin-1, nitric oxide, and an inflammatory cascade ignited by breakdown of blood products play predominant roles. Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor produced by infiltrated leukocytes, and based on this notion, clazosentan was developed as an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist to combat CV. In human trials, clazosentan was found to significantly reduce the incidence of the DCI without improving the functional outcome, and this or a related approach could ultimately prove beneficial if off-target drug effects, including pulmonary complications, hypotension, and anemia can be mitigated (95, 96) . Hemoglobin and its degradation products are also a strong stimulus for CV through direct oxidative stress on arterial smooth muscle, decreased nitric oxide production and, increasing endothelin and free radical production (97) . This suggests that facilitating clearance of hemoglobin degradation products from the CSF may be a potential therapeutic target. Modulating the intense inflammatory response is also intuitive and while preclinical results support this notion in general, the evidence has thus far not been judged adequate to justify clinical trials. For example, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) reduces blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, a biomarker that is itself correlated with the severity of brain injury, and work continues to determine whether this or related pathways mediating BBB permeability might have therapeutic promise (98) . Given these numerous and likely interconnected mechanisms of delayed brain injury, further research is needed to understand their relative applicability to humans, and whether targeting a single pathway or a number of pathways simultaneously is likely to be the most adaptive strategy to reduce CV and DCI in humans.",

It has been shown that candidate compounds with independent confirmation of their therapeutic target via human genomics are more than twice as likely to prove effective in clinical trials (100) . Therefore, the reverse translation approach would seem an adaptive strategy to identify disease-associated mechanisms and therapeutic targets with the best chance of impacting clinical care in the near term.

Recent GWAS and subsequent meta-analyses of ischemic stroke and stroke subtypes in very large case/control datasets have validated the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) region in chromosome 7p21.1 as a major risk locus for stroke due to large artery atheroembolism (LAA). This locus was also previously discovered in association with coronary artery disease (CAD) (101, 102) . Based on these findings, Azghandi et al. sought to investigate the role of the leading single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this genomic region (rs2107595) in increasing LAA stroke risk (103) . They found that rs2107595, both in heterozygotes as well as in homozygote human carriers, is associated with increased expression of HDAC9 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells on a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the effect of this locus in stroke risk may be mediated by increased HDAC9 expression. Additionally, they demonstrated that HDAC9 deficiency in mice is associated with smaller and less advanced atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic valves, curvature, and branching arteries, suggesting that HDAC9 may increase atherogenesis and therefore represents a novel target for atherosclerosis and LAA stroke prevention. Notably, recent studies have suggested that both nonspecific (e.g. sodium valproate) as well as specific HDAC9 inhibitors can have a positive impact on both stroke recurrence risk, as well as other phenotypes, including cancer. This highlights the central role that reverse translation can have in therapeutic target investigation and refinement, with potential beneficial off-target properties (104, 105) .",

The most significant SNP in this locus, rs2228315, which results in a missense mutation, has been successfully replicated in independent cohorts. Further functional analyses have demonstrated that SELPG expression was significantly increased in mice with ventilator (VILI)-and lipoprotein (LPS)-induced lung injury, and that PSGL-1 inhibition with a neutralizing polyclonal antibody led to an attenuation of inflammatory response and lung injury. In SELPG knockout mice, inflammatory response as well as lung injury scores were significantly reduced compared to wild-type mice (106) .

The first major consideration is that large populations of well-characterized individuals must be selected to ensure adequate statistical power to detect meaningful associations. Thorough and standardized phenotyping of study subjects is one of the main predictors of the success of a GWAS (111, 112) . Careful assignment of cases based on strict phenotypic criteria permits well-executed GWAS even in diseases with heterogeneous presentations and multiple pathogenic features, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke (113) . In neurocritical care populations where subtle characteristics of disease presentation and intermediate outcomes may represent important phenotypes for genomic investigation, such as SAH, these traits should be closely defined and recorded to the greatest degree possible in all participants. This initial step is critically important in the greater scheme of reverse translational genomics, as these associations with subclasses and endophenotypes of disease often provide the biological insights needed to continue translational efforts using model systems tailored to refine observations. The second major consideration is that the execution of genomic studies needs to be comprehensive and thorough so as to permit association testing in a hypothesis-free environment. At the moment, GWAS array-based studies seem to remain a favorable option of the genome, considering the lower cost associated with their utilization and proven track record in discovery, but over time, WES and WGS studies will become reachable even on more modest research budgets. For the transcriptome, RNA sequencing and RNA microarrays both offer unbiased surveys of global transcriptional variation, but because gene expression varies substantially by tissue it is critical that rational choices are made regarding the suitability of specific tissues for specific conditions. In uncommon conditions with necessarily small sample sizes, including neurocritical care-relevant diseases like SE, SAH, and ARDS, external validation studies can strengthen associations from an initial small discovery dataset, and in many cases these follow-up studies can make use of freely available resources. For example, in a recent expression-based GWAS (eGWAS), microarray data for ARDS from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were collected and combined in an effort to identify novel genetic targets (114) . The study not only validated previously known lung injury-and ARDSrelated genes, but also discovered 14 new candidate genes that may prove to be useful in future translational work.",

The fertilized egg is then inserted into the oviduct of a pseudopregnant female mouse, which is a female who has been mated with vasectomized male in order to achieve the hormonal profile of a pregnancy state. The offspring produced from this female can create an animal line that contains the human gene and allele of interest (115) . However, because the transgene is inserted randomly at one or more genetic locations as either one or more copies, the level of expression and regulatory influences of the gene of interest may not initially be well-controlled across animals. As such, there are several intermediate steps that can allow more specific genetic alteration using transgenesis, involving embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The first step is the introduction of regulatory sequences (such as expression cassettes) into ESCs. Then, by injecting the transgene first into these modified ESCs, gene expression can be more closely controlled. The ESCs with the transgene can then be inserted into blastocysts and give rise to new strains, using the same methods previously described (116) . There are multiple variations on the transgenic approach which are uniquely suited to the model system being employed and can give rise to models that express transgenes in response to a particular stimulus, or in particular tissues of interest.",

Endonucleases are enzymes that cause double stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks that can further be repaired either with non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), an imprecise method for rejoining the DNA breaks that involves various enzymes and may result in inactivating mutations, or with homologydirected repair (HDR), in which the DNA breaks are repaired based on a co-injected template. Four categories of programmable endonucleases have been used for direct and precise gene editing: homing endonucleases (HE), zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system. The common characteristic of these enzymes is that they possess sequence-specific nuclease activity, allowing researchers to cleave dsDNA at desired, pre-specified sites. The CRISPR/ Cas9 system has proven to be the most successful so far, in terms of efficiency, cost, and simplicity of use. Perhaps the most important advantage of this approach is that programmable endonucleases do not require the use of ESCs and can directly be inserted into one-or two-cell stage embryos, thus allowing more specific and direct gene-editing in a single step (116) . Drawbacks include enzymatic limitations as to where DNA breaks can be reliably introduced, as well as off-target endonuclease activity at other sites across the genome which can disrupt gene activity in unintended ways. Work is ongoing to refine these tools, improving the number of sites where gene editing can occur while also improving the specificity of the system (117).",

            "text": "One illustrative example of human genomic studies being used to refine models to understand disease processes is the case of human ICH-associated mutations in COL4A1 and COL4A2. COL4A1 and COL4A2 are the most abundant proteins in basement membranes. They form heterotrimers consisting of one COL4A1 and two COL4A2 peptides and are produced and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After their production, they are packaged into vesicles in the Golgi apparatus and transferred to vascular endothelial basement membranes (118) (119) (120) . The initial identification of mutations in this region in familial forms of cerebral small vessel disease, coupled with the subsequent detection of common COL4A1/COL4A2 variants associated with sporadic deep ICH led to the development of animal model systems to explore their effects (121) (122) (123) (124) . Through mouse models, representative COL4A1/COL4A2 mutations were found to recapitulate human disease phenotypes, with multifocal ICH in subcortical regions of the forebrain and the cerebellum, as well as porencephaly, small vessel disease, recurrent intraparenchymal and intraventricular hemorrhages, agerelated ICH, and macro-angiopathy (125, 126) . Using cellular assays and tissue derived from mouse models, mutations in COL4A1/COL4A2 have been associated with decreased ratio of intracellular to extracellular Col4a2, retention of abnormal collagen proteins in the ER, ER stress, and activation of the unfolded protein response (126) (127) (128) , suggesting that the intracellular accumulation and ER-stress could be an important molecular mechanism underlying ICH related to COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations. Notably, treatment with the molecular chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate resulted in decreased intracellular accumulation and significant decrease of ICH severity in vivo, which could point the way towards eventual forms of treatment for both familial and sporadic COL4A1and COL4A2-associated ICH (125) .",

Pyridoxal phosphate binding protein (PLPBP) variants have been associated with a rare form of B6-dependent epilepsy, which, if left untreated can lead to SE. In a recent study, Johnstone et al. utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to create a zebrafish model lacking its encoded protein (129) . They observed that PLPBP-deficient zebrafish experienced significantly increased epileptic activity compared to their wild type counterparts, in terms of physical activity (high-speed movements), biochemistry (c-fos expression) and electrophysiologicallyrecorded neuronal activity. Additionally, treatment of plpbp \u2212/ \u2212 larvae with PLP and pyridoxine led to an increase in their lifespan, and a decrease in their epileptic movements and neuronal activity. Lastly, in these PLPBP-deficient zebrafish, systemic concentrations of PLP and pyridoxine were significantly reduced, as well as concentrations of PLP-dependent neurotransmitters. Collectively, these results provide insights for biomarker development and preclinical target refinement in B6-dependent epilepsy. Understanding how novel treatments might impact rare disease presentations could ultimately lead to new insights for common forms of disease as well, just as the discovery of rare PCSK9 variants in patients with very low cholesterol ultimately led to PCSK9-inhibitors to treat more common forms of familial hypercholesterolemia.",

Although the direct impact of these variants in human tissue or animal models is difficult to discern, work with mutations of ANRIL in endothelial models have provided valuable insight. Specifically, upregulation of ANRIL has been associated with increased expression of inflammatory and oxidative markers in the vascular tissue such as IL-6, IL-8, NF-\u03baB, TNF-a, iNOS, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and COX-2 (130, 131) . These observations provide vital information about cellular mechanisms impacted by human disease-associated genetic risk factors without requiring the expense and time investment of creating, validating, and studying animal models. Ultimately such models may still be required, but prior knowledge about cellular phenotypes associated with genetic variation may be highly valuable in choosing the right model system and selecting efficient approaches to validate these systems.",

The same in vitro assays used to identify cellular phenotypes associated with genetic risk factors can be tested for amelioration or \"rescue\" of wild-type features after exposure to library compounds. This is particularly advantageous for the reverse genomic translation approach, as these assays are often critical components of the overall discovery cycle, and with optimization to provide ideal readouts, screening can proceed quickly. An example of success here is the identification of molecular chaperones that can ameliorate the unfolded protein response detrimental to cell survival in COL4A1-mediated cerebrovascular disease (125) . Identifying hits in these assays has the potential to accelerate drug-discovery, provided that the mechanism can be targeted by a small molecule and not a designed biologic entity such as a monoclonal antibody. While screening can be performed using novel compound libraries, it can also be accomplished using libraries containing already-approved drugs, providing an innovative way for compound repurposing based on genetic interactions. Numerous tools already exist for in silico evaluation of existing compounds based on known mechanisms, so this step can begin even in the genomic discovery phase prior to translational validation (133) .",

By summarizing the impact of many variants of small effect across the genome simultaneously, a polygenic risk score (PRS) can be developed which explains far more of the genetic risk of a disease than any common variant can individually (Fig. 2) . Application of these PRS in independent clinical populations as a predictive tool represents a novel translational approach. In a recent study examining stroke, a PRS combining SNPs associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) was found to be significantly associated with cardioembolic (CE) stroke risk and no other stroke subtypes, paving the way for a potentially useful tool to discriminate CE stroke from other etiologies without reliance on expert adjudication or longitudinal monitoring (134) . Another recent study compiled a PRS of CAD, demonstrating that individuals in the highest quantiles of the PRS exhibited CAD risk on par with known Mendelian cardiac diseases (135) . These studies highlight the potential uses of PRS as a genetic biomarker of disease, capturing orthogonal risk information compared to clinical risk factors alone. Much work is still needed in this arena, ranging from derivation of readily accessible clinical genomic testing, dissemination of PRS results in an interpretable format, disclosure of off-target results that may be clinically meaningful in their own right, and, critically, the validation of PRS in ancestrally-diverse populations (136) . Despite these challenges, utilization of polygenic risk data to directly inform patient risk independent of our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is an exciting and rapidly evolving use-case for translational genomics.",

Plotting percentiles by disease risk, patients in higher PRS percentiles (red dots) are at correspondingly highest risk for the disease outcomes are highly heterogenous, tools that might identify patients who are more likely to respond to certain treatments or identify individuals at highest risk for morbidity and mortality would be highly useful. In a recent study by Scicluna et al., the authors categorized sepsis patients based on peripheral bloodderived genome-wide expression profiles and identified four distinct molecular endotypes (Mars1-4) (137) . The Mars1 expression profile was the only category that was significantly associated with 28-day and 1-year mortality. In addition, combination of the APACHE IV clinical score with this genetic scoring system resulted in significant improvement in 28-day mortality risk prediction, compared to APACHE IV alone. To further aid translation to clinical application, the authors used expression ratios of combinations of genes to stratify patients to the four molecular endotypes. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM): Transporter 2, ATP binding cassette subfamily B member (TAP2) ratio reliably stratified patients to Mars1 endotype; while other protein ratios were able to assign individuals to the other three MARS categories. Using this approach, not only could BPGM and TAP2 transcripts potentially be used to identify patients with increased risk of mortality, but if these categorizations can be demonstrated to be causal, these molecular pathways could also be explored for therapeutic target identification and validation. Further work is required to extend these findings across clinical populations, but this approach could ultimately yield new tools for prognostication in sepsis.",

While in the current clinical landscape the vast majority of patients do not have readily accessible genome-wide genotypes prior to events like acute stroke, increasing uptake of clinical genomics and genomically-enabled electronic health record systems could soon enable real-time risk prediction calculations incorporating both clinical and genetic information, providing more accurate tools for clinicians to incorporate into medical decision-making.",

Some studies reported the area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.76 to 0.987, indicating a potential for clinical utility as early diagnostic markers when neuroimaging is not immediately available or is limited by feasibility. Subsequent studies were able to partially replicate these findings, showing three miRNAs (miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-143-3p) that were upregulated in the acute poststroke period, an effect independent of stroke pathophysiology and infarct volume (141) . These transcripts were associated with an AUC of 0.90 in differentiating ischemic stroke and healthy controls, a metric that significantly outperformed computed tomography, as well as previously reported bloodbased biomarkers.",

Only a minority are seen in adultonset status epilepticus (144) . The patients in the former group usually have accompanying intellectual disability related to their epilepsy syndromes. However, the evidence supporting a genetic etiology in the latter group may be absent, posing a diagnostic challenge. The available options include gene panel sequencing, whole exome sequencing, or whole genome sequencing. Sequencing a pre-selected panel of genes is more common, but with decreasing cost, exome and genome sequencing are being used with increasing frequency. Bioinformatic filtering and genotype-phenotype correlation are the main challenges, particularly with the large number of genetic variants identified during whole exome or genome sequencing. The yield of sequencing studies depends on pretest probability that is determined by early age of onset, consanguinity, or affected siblings. As such, to date, only a few genes associated with adult-onset SE have been identified, posing a practical limitation that predominantly limits next-generation sequencing to pediatric patients at present (144) . As clinical tools for determination of putative functional significance and deleteriousness of variants identified through sequencing are refined, it is hoped that sequencing approaches find a home in the armamentarium of the clinicians treating refractory or recurrent SE in the neurocritical care unit.",

Similar efforts through the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium and other partners could lead to biorepositories of specific conditions relevant to neurocritical care that could provide sample sizes sufficient to drive unbiased genomic discoveries (151) . Close alliances with model systems researchers are another critical component to accelerating translational genomics in neurocritical care. As characterization of human disease through multimodal and continuous physiological monitoring, electrophysiology, medical imaging, and biomarker sampling continues to evolve, it is imperative that this information is shared and explored with allied model systems researchers to ensure that models are re-evaluated for their correlation with these endophenotypes, and potentially for dedicated exploration of how these human-derived phenotypes inform on the utility of specific model systems to investigate disease.",
