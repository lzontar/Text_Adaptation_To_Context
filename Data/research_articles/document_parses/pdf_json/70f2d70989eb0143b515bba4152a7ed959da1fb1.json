Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is considered as a subgroup of nosocomial pneumonia and is an infectious pulmonary process which develops 48 hours after the presence of an artificial airway and mechanical ventilation. Since a large proportion of the patients who develop nosocomial pneumonia are intubated and receive mechanical ventilation, most epidemiological and clinical studies on nosocomial pneumonia have been focused on critically ill patients and those receiving mechanical ventilation.

Likewise, previous antibiotic administration may influence the development of VAP in two different ways: Its use may be associated with a protective effect against early-onset pneumonia, while, on the other hand, it may be associated with an increased risk of lateonset pneumonia. To determine the baseline and time-dependent risk factors for VAP, Cook et al. [8] evaluated 1014 patients. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of VAP were a primary diagnosis on admission of burns (risk ratio 5.09), trauma (risk ratio 5.00), central nervous system disease (risk ratio 3.40), respiratory disease, cardiac disease (risk ratio 2.72), mechanical ventilation within the previous 24 hours (risk ratio 2.28), witnessed aspiration (risk ratio 3.25) and paralytic agents. Exposure to antibiotics conferred protection (risk ratio 0.37), but this effect attenuated over time. Rello et al. [17] evaluated the risk factors for VAP within the first 8 days of mechanical ventilation in 83 consecutive intubated patients undergoing continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions. Multivariate analysis showed the protective effect of antibiotic use (relative risk 0.10) whereas failure of continuous aspiration of subglottic secretions (relative risk 5.29) was associated with a greater risk of pneumonia. In addition, Sirvent et al. [18] evaluated the use of systemic prophylaxis with cefuroxime before intubation on the incidence of VAP in 100 patients with coma, 50 of whom received one dose of 1.5 g of cefuroxime intravenously at the time of intubation and a second dose 12 h later. The global incidence of early-onset VAP was 37 % (n = 37): 12 (24 %) in the cefuroxime group and 25 (50 %) in the control group (p = 0.007). All these studies demonstrate the protective effect of antibiotic therapy in early VAP caused by endogenous flora. In a prospective study in 277 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, Kollef [10] determined that the following four factors were associated with VAP: Index of systemic organ failure 3 (odds ratio [OR]=10.2), age 60 years (OR = 5.1), previous antibiotics (OR = 3.1), and supine head position within the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.9). In addition to the importance of antibiotic therapy as a risk factor for VAP, the influence of antibiotics on the etiology of this disease is also relevant. In a prospective study, Rello et al. [19] studied 129 consecutive episodes of VAP to evaluate the influence of prior antibiotic administration on the etiology and mortality of VAP.

As a general rule, tracheobronchial aspirate has very good sensitivity with a specificity a little lower than the invasive tests when using a quantitative culture of the respiratory secretions obtained by this method [31] . In different studies, the sensitivity of this test varies from 38 -100 % with a specificity of 14 -100 % [32] . A negative tracheobronchial aspirate culture in a patient who has not received antibiotic treatment has a high negative predictive value for the presence of VAP.
