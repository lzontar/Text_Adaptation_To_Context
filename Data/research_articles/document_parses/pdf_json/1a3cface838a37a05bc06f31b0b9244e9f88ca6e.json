The operation of the sharing economy often involves a platform that facilitates relationships between buyers and sellers to arrange access to rent or purchase resources (e.g., Hagiu and Wright, 2015; Horton and Zechhauser, 2016) . The success of the business model relies on peer-to-peer accommodation networks on a platform that connects sellers and buyers (e.g., Rochet and Tirole, 2003; Evans and Schmalensee, 2016) . Airbnb is the most successful room sharing business model; it provides a platform to connect hosts and guests on opposite sides of the same platform. Airbnb hosts offer unused or underutilized space while Airbnb guests look for a place to stay.

On the one hand, room sharing business models may distort housing rents or sales prices through the reduction of housing supply in the market. After the entry of room sharing platforms, property owners can remove their property previously occupied by residential tenants from the housing rental market and reallocate them onto Airbnb for short-term accommodation. The reduction in the supply of rental properties in the housing market would then increase rental prices. Similarly, housing sales prices can rise if property owners decide to reallocate their properties from the housing sales market to Airbnb (Lee, 2016) . On the other hand, Airbnb may not affect the current supply of the housing rental market if the majority of Airbnb listings are spare or unused rooms that are otherwise not available.

Endogeneity bias occurs if there are unobserved factors that simultaneously affect housing rental or sales prices and the number of Airbnb listings. For example, property owners living in better quality communities may be less likely to engage with Airbnb because the platform could bring tourists that can worsen the living quality of the neighborhood due to increased noise, trash, or unsafe streets. On the other hand, unobserved community preferences for better environmental quality may lead to increased housing prices.

It provides the theoretical underpinnings for empirical models that estimate the marginal prices for a product's characteristics. This model has been widely used to examine the role of environmental factors and land characteristics on housing prices (see Sheppard (1999) for literature review). unobserved community preferences then results in endogeneity bias.
