New developments in molecular virology and immunobiology of SARS-CoV-2, improve our understanding about COVID-19 prevention, management, and possible long-term effects.

Similar to SARS-CoV 2002, viral entry into target cells by SARS-CoV-2 is likely mediated by the interaction between the viral spike (S) protein and cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (4, 5) . ACE2 is expressed in multiple organ systems including type II alveolar cells of the lungs, intestine, heart, kidney, and the testis (4, 5) .

Patients had one or more of these symptoms at the time of COVID-19 confirmation, but generally demonstrated milder symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was extracted using the automatic nucleic acid extraction system (3DMed\u00ae, Shanghai, China), per manufacturer's instruction. Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were amplified and tested using real-time RT-PCR (Anda Gene Ltd\u00ae, Guangzhou, China). A cycle threshold value less than 37 cycles was defined as a positive test, and a value of 40 cycles or more was defined as a negative test, per recommendation of the Chinese National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention. Samples with an equivocal cycle threshold were retested. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in semen samples was performed using an identical protocol. Semen sample testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Given safety concerns regarding viral transmission from the semen specimens, comprehensive semen analyses were not performed on the samples. To investigate the gene expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in different cells of the testes, we examined our prior published single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset of human testicular cells at the University of Utah (9, 10) . The scRNA-seq dataset was analyzed as described in prior work (9, 10) . In brief, single cell RNA profiling experiments were performed by loading single testicular cells from testes of three healthy, young adults to 10X Genomics\u00ae Chromium platform to generate libraries, which were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500\u00ae. The generated fastq files were then de-multiplexed and aligned using CellRanger\u00ae, which will generate the single cell gene expression matrices. The gene expression matrices were then analyzed using dimension reduction algorithm (t-SNE) and clustering approaches. Cells with similar transcriptomes were placed in proximity to each other with the same color. Known markers were utilized to help decode the major testicular cell type identities, as described in prior work (9, 10) . Detailed downstream analysis was performed using customized R script. The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were examined and displayed by projecting them onto the t-SNE plot. In addition, co-localization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were reported, and their correlation was calculated. Figure 1A ). Cells were colored based on cell identities (10) . We examined the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by projecting their expression to the t-SNE plot, observing very low expression of both genes ( Figure 1B) . Last, we examined coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in every single testicular cell ( Figure 1C ); only 4 of 6490 cells displayed expression of both genes (Pearson correlation value = -0.01), suggesting limited overlap expression.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1590, "end": 1593, "text": "(9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1597, "text": "10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1662, "end": 1665, "text": "(9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1666, "end": 1669, "text": "10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2390, "end": 2393, "text": "(9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2397, "text": "10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2739, "end": 2743, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2682, "end": 2691, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2889, "end": 2899, "text": "Figure 1B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2987, "end": 2996, "text": "Figure 1C", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Methods:"}, {"text": "In our study, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 within the semen of adult Chinese males recovering from COVID-19.

Many viruses such as Mumps, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human herpes virus, Ebola, and Zika can be detected in human semen after infection and can cause orchitis (11, 12) . These viruses, through febrile illness, can have a negative impact on male reproductive function and spermatogenesis (11) . Before our analysis, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function was largely unknown. Previously, Xu et al. reported testicular pathology after autopsy from six males who died from complications of SARS-CoV (13) . The authors found widespread destruction of germ cells and sperm, in a background of complex inflammatory infiltrate. Although they were unable to isolate a genomic signature from SARS-CoV itself, they postulated that SARS-CoV caused orchitis and reproductive impairment. ACE2, a likely receptor for viral entry by SARS-CoV-2, has been previously localized to human Leydig and Sertoli cells (14) . Our single-cell transcriptome data suggests ACE2 RNA expression occurs at low levels. Therefore, ACE2mediated viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into target host cells is unlikely to occur within the human testicle.

First, our results are impacted by the small sample size and selection bias, as men with COVID-19 in this study are more likely to have demonstrated milder symptoms. Prior research has suggested that higher viral loads are associated with more severe disease symptoms, and it is plausible that viremia or a certain viral threshold is not achieved to cross the blood-testis barrier (15) . Second, given safety concerns regarding viral transmission from the semen specimens, comprehensive semen analyses were not performed. We were only able to obtain a single semen sample for the purposes of this study, with only three patients providing a sample within 14 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis. This limits our ability to provide data on possible early viral shedding in the semen. Third, not all patients in our cohort had a comprehensive genitourinary examination, limiting interpretations regarding the incidence of scrotal findings consistent with orchitis during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fourth, we were unable to assess hormone profiles in our cohort, including total testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle stimulating hormone, which could provide an assessment of testicular function. This preliminary data is unable to characterize the long-term impact of COVID-19 on fertility and testicular endocrine function. Finally, we only examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the RNA expression level. We understand that gene expression may not always reflect protein abundance, and cannot explicitly conclude that these proteins are absent.

Additionally, we did not find evidence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in high fidelity RNA datasets from our prior published work at the University of Utah, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 would likely not be able to gain entry to testicular cells through an ACE2/TMPRSS2-mediated mechanism.
