In a modern and mobile society, however, there are also other scenarios with large numbers of severely injured persons, e.g. the recent train accident at Bad Aibling, which are unavoidable despite high safety standards.

Interestingly, the pre-hospital time, i.e. the time from the accident until arrival in the Emergency Department, is apparently not an independent risk factor, at least not for all patients as a whole. Nevertheless, even data collection by the best current risk prediction tool, the RISC II [13] , identifies pre-hospital time as an independent risk factor predicting mortality. On the other hand, it is known that in cases of severe intra-abdominal bleeding, a time delay of one minute increases mortality by 3% [5] . Since the predictive power of recognizing these injuries in the prehospital setting is low and the concerned patients can easily S36 go unrecognized [2, 10, 16] , it is advisable to transport all patients with potentially severe injuries as quickly as possible to the hospital, where the full range of diagnostic and targeted interventions can be performed. In the end, however, whether some time-consuming procedures are performed at the accident scene or are postponed until the early hospital phase must be weighed. It certainly plays a role here as to how urgent the indication for an intervention is, whether there are particular difficulties in carrying it out, or whether individual skills are sufficient to do it safely and correctly. In the meantime, it has also been found that the time gained by skipping interventions in the pre-hospital phase is lost again during the Emergency Department phase. Thus, the balance between the ''load and go'' and ''stay and play'' approaches to pre-hospital management must be based first and foremost on the urgency of the required intervention [12] . Life-saving interventions should not be foregone in favor of a shorter pre-hospital time. Conversely, some measures, e.g. surgical hemostasis of internal bleeding, must be performed in the hospital.

Recently, the benefits of air rescue in particular have proliferated, because it seems to be associated with improved survival after severe accident-related trauma. One suspected reason for this advantage is the ability of helicopters to reach an appropriate target hospital more rapidly than ground-based rescue services, especially when the hospital is far away. Particularly when it comes to special requirements, e.g. a neurosurgical department in cases of severe TBI, center-related effects could be a reason for the benefits of air rescue.

Criteria for the requirements there are listed in the ''Trauma Team Activation'' chapter of the ''Emergency Department'' section of this guideline. The guideline group placed low priority on the revision of this chapter. However, questions surrounding over-and under-triage based on the recommendations there continue to present in daily practice as a stress test for hospital resources. In 2012, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) published an update of its recommendations regarding assignment of patients to a trauma center, which has also been translated into German [19] . The criteria given there are similar to the German trauma team activation criteria. The main problem, however, is that especially the criteria regarding accident mechanism, in the absence of other criteria, might invite speculation that trauma team management is not indicated. Leaders in the emergency medical services (EMS) and the medical director of the EMS should work together with the trauma network to develop locally-adapted processes to meet their respective needs. In view of the difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis in the pre-hospital setting, however, the pre-hospital team should accept higher rates of over-triage over under-triage, for the benefit of patients.

With the ''Trauma Care Bundle'' for pre-hospital management of severely injured patients, the German Trauma Society's section on Emergency, Intensive care, and Injuries (section NIS) transferred key recommendations into a short and practical treatment guide, thus attempting to create a basis for improving quality of care [15] . There are also a variety of commercially available course formats, such as Prehospital Trauma Life Support\u00d2 (PHTLS), International Trauma Life Support\u00d2 (ITLS) or TraumaManagement\u00d2, which provide and distribute practical treatment protocols. The individual steps in these protocols conform to the key recommendations of the S3 guideline, but cannot be scientifically backed up in detail, as explained above. Thus, the present guideline did not aim to redevelop a similar concept. It should be emphasized here that all of these management interventions must be physically practiced and trained within the team. Within the ''pre-hospital'' section of the guideline, the current state of knowledge was accepted without much disagreement by the expert representatives, and high levels of agreement were attained. At the same time, the available knowledge remains incomplete in many areas, which is why consensus is often shaped by expert opinions. For this reason, the ''new'' recommendation grading system of GPP (Good Clinical Practice Points) was introduced for recommendations for which there is not evaluable evidence, but are considered important enough to make a recommendation. We hope that knowledge deficits and gaps, or recommendations that are not accepted universally, will inspire efforts to close these gaps, at least partially, with solid scientific research leading up to the next revision of the S3 guideline.

This is about securing the basic vital functions directly associated with survival. In established standards of trauma care, the ''A'' for airway and ''B'' for breathing are given the highest priority and thus, are S38 particularly important for both pre-hospital and early hospital management [4, 131, 183] . One problem with evaluating the evidence available is that information cannot be directly referred to the German rescue and emergency physician system, due to the divergent organization of emergency rescue services internationally and the resulting differences in experience and routines used to secure the airway. This applies particularly for negative results from paramedic systems [102, 157] . Although paramedics are often employed in the Anglo-American region, the emergency physician system is widely used in continental Europe. But even here there is variation. In Germany, (specialist) physicians from all disciplines can participate in emergency services after acquiring the appropriate qualification, but in Scandinavian countries, this is mainly reserved for anesthesiologists [14] . As a consequence, the evaluation of international studies regarding pre-hospital securing of the airway reveals emergency medical personnel with very different levels of training. Depending on the personnel employed and how commonly they perform intubation, high rates of unsuccessful intubations are found in the literature, with 15 to 31%.

In addition to the acute consequences of trauma on individual body regions, there is a mediatormediated whole-body reaction, i.e. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) [48, 93] . Tissue oxygenation takes on special significance in this damage cascade. Tissue oxygenation can only be achieved if oxygen uptake, transport and release are maintained. Oxygen uptake is only possible with a free airway. Direct consequences of trauma (e.g. facial fractures, laryngeal injuries or obstruction due to blood, vomit and/or secretions), but also inability to keep the airway open independently because of loss of consciousness, can make securing the airway necessary. Endotracheal intubation is the gold standard for definitive airway protection according to current European and non-European guidelines [56, 130, 131] .

Severe impairment of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) \\ 9 due to a traumatic brain injury is regarded as an indication for intubation [12] . For the trauma patient with impairedconsciousness GCS B 8, endotracheal intubation in both pre-hospital and hospital settings is also recommended in the guideline of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) [56] and other training programs (e.g., ATLS \u00d2 [4] , ETC [70] ). Hypoxia and hypotension are the ''lethal duo'' inducing secondary damage particularly in polytrauma patients with traumatic brain injury [36, 37, 90, 155, 158] . Abnormal brain computed tomography (38%) and intracranial bleeding (28%) have been reported even in patients with GCS of 13 or 14 who were endotracheally intubated in the pre-hospital phase [61] . In a pre-hospital cohort study, endotracheal intubation had a positive effect on survival following severe traumatic brain injury [96] . A comparative registry database study, which due to a number of factors is not comparable to the German emergency physician system, found a higher mortality for patients with a GCS of 3 who were intubated in the pre-hospital setting (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.93; 95 % CI: 1.74-2.15, p \\ 0.0001) [88] . However, in the post-hoc subgroup analysis by the Resuscitation Outcome Consortium (ROC) Hypertonic Saline (HS) trials (RCT) [173] , which looked at data from two randomized clinical studies using hypertonic infusions, there was no increased 28-day mortality in TBI patients intubated in the pre-hospital setting versus those intubated in the Emergency Department (OR 1.57; 95% CI: 0. 93-2.64 ). This study is also not transferable to the German emergency physician system for numerous reasons. There was increased 28-day mortality for patients in shock (SBP \\ 70 mmHg or SBP 71-90 mmHg + HR [ 108 bpm) who had been intubated in the pre-hospital setting (OR 5.14; 95% CI: 2. 42-10.90) . Limitations in the interpretations of the secondary analysis of the ROC HS trial [173] include the pre-hospital paramedic system, the lack of data regarding the type of airway/anesthetic management, and the fact that muscle relaxants were used in only 70% of cases. Another retrospective study showed reduced mortality for children with severe TBI who were intubated by emergency physicians in the pre-hospital phase versus those receiving Basic Life Support (BLS) and delayed intubation in regional trauma centers [159] . Limiting consideration to the pediatric population, pre-hospital intubation was carried out by emergency medical physicians in this study, meaning good transferability to the German emergency physician system. Using the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), another study also confirmed that pre-hospital intubation yields improved survival and neurologic outcomes [63] . Another paper showed improvements in the measured systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) compared to baseline values prior to pre-hospital intubation in patients with severe TBI [16] . A methodically weaker retrospective analysis in a paramedic system showed no survival advantage for patients with TBI [30] . Regarding the time point of intubation in patients with traumatic brain injury and decreased level of consciousness, important results can be found in a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which intubation was performed by paramedics with a standard rapid sequence induction (RSI) protocol (fentanyl 0.1 mg + midazolam 0.1 mg/kg + succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg) in patients with GCS \\ 10 (intubation success rate of 97%) compared to cases intubated by physicians on arrival to the hospital [17] . Using the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (eGOS), patients undergoing pre-hospital intubation had better neurological outcomes after six months [eGOS 5-8 (n = 157 vs. n = 142): 51% vs. 39% with RR 1.28; 95% CI: 1.00-1.64, p = 0.046] than those managed in-hospital [17] . However, duration of intensive care and hospital admissions as well as survival until discharge did not differ [17] . A comparative registry database study also supports the recommended indications for intubation in TBI listed above, particularly for severely affected patients [47] . A retrospective cohort study of comparable patient groups (ISS 10 vs. 11) reported that delayed endotracheal intubation (n = 34, intubation 24 min) was associated with higher mortality than earlier intubation (n = 56, intubation 10-24 min) after admission to the Emergency Department (11.8 % vs. 1.8 %, p = 0.045) [112] .

On the other hand, however, the authors of the EAST Guideline also found no studies presenting a proven alternative treatment strategy.

A current investigation on airway protection in moderately injured patients supports apnea as an indication for intubation [85] .

Hypoxia and respiratory failure have been established as consequences of severe chest trauma (multiple rib fractures, lung contusion, flail chest). If hypoxia is refractory to oxygen administration, exclusion of tension pneumothorax, and basic measures of airway support, endotracheal intubation is recommended [56] . Pre-hospital endotracheal intubation in patients with severe thoracic trauma can prevent hypoxia and hypoventilation, which are associated with secondary neurologic damage and severe repercussions on the rest of the body. However, with difficult, prolonged attempts at intubation and the associated hypoventilation and risk of hypoxia, endotracheal intubation itself can cause procedure-associated secondary damage or even death. A database analysis of the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society showed no advantage in prehospital endotracheal intubation in patients suffering chest trauma without respiratory insufficiency [141] . Severe chest injury with respiratory insufficiency does present an indication for prehospital endotracheal intubation; however, the decision to intubate should be made based on respiratory insufficiency and not the (suspected) diagnosis of severe chest injury, which is associated with a degree of uncertainty [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 238, "end": 242, "text": "[85]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 342, "end": 347, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 661, "end": 665, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1303, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1616, "end": 1620, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indications for Intubation"}, {"text": "Endotracheal intubation is included as an ''Advanced Life Support'' procedure in the pre-hospital action algorithms of various training programs (e.g., PHTLS\u00d2, ETC) [70, 126] .

Using a scoring system to evaluate management problems along with the relevant autopsy reports, a series of fatal traffic accidents were retrospectively analyzed to characterize the effectiveness of pre-hospital care and potentially avoidable mortality [136] .

A retrospective cohort study of 570 intubated patients versus 8137 non-intubated patients reported that patients intubated prehospital had pre-hospital times lasting 5.2-10.7 minutes longer than that of non-intubated patients [43] . A prospective non-randomized study assessed the influence of early intubation within two hours of trauma on subsequent organ failure [169] . Despite a significantly higher degree of injury in the group of patients who were intubated ''early'' (within 2 hours of trauma), the incidence of organ failure and mortality were decreased compared to those intubated ''later.'' A retrospective trauma registry database study compared 3571 patients intubated pre-hospital to 746 patients intubated in the Emergency Department and 11 586 patients who were not intubated at all [7] . Intubation performed in the Emergency Department was associated with significantly higher mortality risk compared to non-intubated patients (OR 3.1; 95% CI: 2.1-4.5, p \\ 0.0001) and patients intubated in the pre-hospital setting (OR 3.0; 95 % CI: 1.9-4.9, p \\ 0.0001) [7] . It should also be noted that patients intubated in the prehospital setting did not have a higher mortality risk than patients who were not intubated in the Emergency Department (OR 1.1; 95 % CI: 0.7-1.9; p = 0.6). The authors concluded that patients who weren't intubated before arriving in the Emergency Department should have been intubated in the pre-hospital setting [7] . Thus, when choosing the optimal time point for anesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation, one must consider the pattern of injury, the personal experience of the emergency physician/anesthesiologist, the ambient environment, the time needed for transfer, the equipment available, and the procedure-related complications. With these points in mind, for definitive care, the polytrauma patient must undergo emergency anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and ventilation. Endotracheal intubation must be carried out for appropriate indications and corresponding level of training in the pre-hospital setting, or at the latest in the Emergency Department. According to an analysis of the German Trauma Society's trauma registry database, of 24 771 patients, 31% unconscious at the accident scene (GCS \\9), 19% showed severe hemodynamic instability (SBP\\ 90 mmHg), and 55% were intubated by the emergency physician in the pre-hospital setting [140] . According to this analysis, 9% of polytrauma patients' time in the Emergency Department was cut short for a necessary emergency intervention, 77% of the polytrauma patients eventually underwent an operative intervention, and 87% were in intensive care [140] . A large number of polytrauma patients require intensive care ventilation and invasive ventilation therapy because of traumatic brain injury and/or chest trauma, and all require adequate pain therapy.

A large retrospective study using the trauma registry of a Level I trauma center evaluated 6088 patients in whom endotracheal intubation had been performed within the first hour of hospital admission [156] . According to this trauma registry, an additional 26 000 trauma patients were intubated on the day of hospital admission after the first hour of hospital care. As shown in this hospital study, in the hands of experienced anesthesiologists, rapid sequence induction is an effective and safe procedure. No patients died during intubation. Of 6088 patients, 6008 were successfully intubated orotracheally (98.7%), and a further 59 nasotracheally (0.97%). Only 17 patients (0.28%) needed cricothyroidotomy and 4 patients (0.07%) underwent emergency tracheotomy. Three other patients later required emergency tracheotomy after endotracheal intubation [156] . Another retrospective study of a monocenter trauma registry studied 1000 trauma patients (9.9% of 10 137 patients) who had been endotracheally intubated within 2 hours of admission to the trauma center [153] . At\\1%, the incidence of surgical airway placement was also uncommon. Aspiration occurred in 1.1% of intubations. Early intubation was also considered safe and effective by the authors [153] . These data also confirm that endotracheal intubation of trauma patients is a safe procedure in the hands of anesthesiologists. Another retrospective study from a paramedic-supported system showed a success rate of 96.6% and a markedly higher cricothyroidotomy rate of 2.3% in 175 endotracheally intubated patients [62] . In 1.1% of cases, patients were ventilated by bag-valve-mask during transfer to hospital. There were five cases of right endobronchial intubation (2.9%) and two cases of tube displacement (1.1%). There were no documented cases of failed intubation. In pre-hospital emergency medicine, intubation success varies among various provider types and physicians of various specialties [72] . An observational study of 7259 trauma patients examining failed intubation found significant differences between anesthesiologists and non-anesthesiologists performing the procedure (11/2587, 0.4 % vs. 41/4394, 0.9 %, p = 0.02) [105] .

In fact, an analysis of patients with ISS C 16 in the German Trauma Society database found that endotracheal intubation at the accident scene is associated with an average pre-hospital time increase of 9 \u00b1 1 min [184] . However, this does not necessarily reflect a disadvantage regarding the entire treatment time for patients from trauma to end of Emergency Department care. Another comparative study of the German Trauma Society's trauma registry over the years 2002-2007 performed by Kulla et al. [99] stratified the patients into three groups: Group AA (n = 963, pre-hospital intubation and chest tube placement), group AB (n = 1547; pre-hospital intubation and in-hospital chest tube placement), and group BB (n = 640; in-hospital intubation and chest tube placement). While the pre-hospital care times of all groups differed (time of trauma until hospital arrival: 80 \u00b1 37 vs. 77 \u00b1 44 vs. 64 \u00b1 46 min), there was no difference in overall treatment time (time of trauma until end of Emergency Department care: 152 \u00b1 59 vs. 151 \u00b1 62 vs. 148 \u00b1 68 min). This study makes clear that in cases where prehospital (indicated) interventions are postponed, although the time to Emergency Department arrival is decreased (while life-threatening risks persist), the saved time is lost again during the Emergency Department care phase. Thus, no overall time benefit (pre-hospital phase + Emergency Department phase) is produced. For this reason, indicated pre-hospital and potentially life-saving interventions (e.g., endotracheal intubation, chest tube placement) should also be performed in the pre-hospital phase [99] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 351, "end": 356, "text": "[184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1614"}, {"start": 639, "end": 643, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1751, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indications for Intubation"}, {"text": "In the German-speaking emergency physician system, pediatric and adult emergency patients are endotracheally intubated with very high success rates when the procedure is carried out by experienced and trained personnel.

Owing to the inclusion criteria, it appears, at least after the fact, that the authors endorsed relatively minor needs for invasive airway management. These patients were matched with comparable cases who were treated without pre-hospital endotracheal intubation. Comparison of the two homogeneous groups showed that intubated patients differ significantly from non-intubated regarding longer prehospital time, increased volume replacement, and worse coagulation parameters on admission to the Emergency Department. In addition, intubated patients had higher rates of sepsis (not intubated 1.5% vs. intubated 3.7%; p B 0.02) and organ failure (not intubated 9.1% vs. intubated 23.4%; p B 0.001). Regarding the harder treatment outcome ''hospital mortality,'' however, the groups did not differ (intubated 0.5 vs. non-intubated 1.0%, p = 0.32). One weakness of this study is the retrospective design based on registry data, since it remains unclear what the pre-hospital indications for intubation were. Accurate determination of true severity of injury is often difficult in the pre-hospital setting [75, 122] , and it is possible that the indications for intubation in the investigated cases later proved to be unnecessary, distorting the end results of the study. In cases of doubt, it is advisable to favor pre-hospital intubation if it is indicated by the airway evaluation or the suspected pattern of injury, since there is no difference in hospital mortality. The basic prerequisite for this is that the provider is proficient with the procedure.

In a non-randomized controlled study of 34 intensive-care patients, the mean paO2 at the onset of pre-oxygenation was (T0) 62 \u00b1 15 mmHg, after 4 minutes (T4) 84 \u00b1 52 mmHg, after 6 minutes (T6) 88 \u00b1 49 mmHg, and after 8 minutes (T8) 93 \u00b1 55 mmHg. The differences in paO2 were significantly different between T0 and T4-8, but not individually between T4, T6 and T8. In 24% of patients, there was even a PaO2 reduction between T4 and T8. A longer period of pre-oxygenation for 4 to 8 minutes did not lead to any marked improvement in arterial oxygen partial pressure and it delays securing the airway in critical patients [119, 120] . Thus, appropriately performed pre-oxygenation for 4 minutes has particular importance in securing the airway of polytrauma patients. The recommendations listed here correspond to those in the Treatment Recommendations for Pre-Hospital Emergency Anesthesia in Adults by the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr An\u00e4sthesiologie und Intensivmedizin) as well as of the S1 Guideline (AWMF) by the same name [19] . Pre-oxygenation by emergency personnel begins immediately after the decision to anesthetize/intubate, while anesthetic and emergency medications as well as equipment for airway support and ventilation are being prepared. Pre-oxygenation must be performed exclusively with 100% oxygen using a face mask or a tight-fitting bag-valve-mask, each with an oxygen reservoir (at least 12-15 L O2/min) or, even more effective, through use of a demand valve or by non-invasive ventilation (NIV) when contraindications are excluded [19] . Even with maximum oxygen flow, a facemask without a reservoir is not sufficient. One approach that can facilitate pre-oxygenation (particularly in non-cooperative patients) is the use of dissociative anesthesia by administration of ketamine (similar to ''delayed sequence intubation) [182] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 251, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 873, "end": 878, "text": "[119,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 879, "end": 883, "text": "120]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1344, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1872, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2164, "text": "[182]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1612"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pre-Oxygenation"}, {"text": "Key recommendation: 1.5 Recommendation 2016", "cite_spans": [{"start": 20, "end": 23, "text": "1.5", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Education and Training"}, {"text": "GoR A Emergency personnel must be regularly trained in emergency anesthesia, endotracheal intubation, and alternative methods of airway protection (mask ventilation, laryngeal tube, cricothyrotomy).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Education and Training"}, {"text": "In a recent survey of emergency physicians working in the emergency physician service, questions were posed regarding knowledge of and experience in endotracheal intubation and alternative methods for securing an airway [163] . This survey received responses from 340 anesthesiologists (56.1%) and 266 non-anesthesiologists. It found that all anesthesia-trained emergency physicians had performed more than 100 in-hospital endotracheal intubations compared to only 35% of non-anesthesiologists. A similar picture emerged for alternative methods of securing an airway. 97.8% of anesthesiologists-as-emergency physicians had used alternative methods of securing an airway on more than 20 occasions, while only 11.1% of nonanesthesiologist emergency physicians had equivalent experience (p \\ 0.05). In addition, it came out that only 27% of emergency equipment included CO2 monitoring (capnography). From this study, it can be concluded that there is an urgent need for training of non-anesthesiologist emergency physicians in endotracheal intubation, capnography, and alternative airway methods [131] . Studies on first-year anesthesiology residents have reported that more than 60 intubations are necessary to achieve a success rate of 90% within the first two attempts under standardized, optimum conditions in the operating room [98] . Another proficiency study of 20 non-anesthesiologist physicians performing endotracheal intubation on 438 patients for elective anesthesia found an increasing success rate and better vocal cord visualization up to the S44 35th intubation. An 80% success rate was observed after the 35th intubation, and 90% after the 47th [123] . The largest prospective monocenter study to date on the development of intubation proficiency of first year anesthesia residents (n = 21) showed progressive intubation success rates from the 25th to the 200th intubation for first pass intubation success (FPS: 67 vs. 83%, p = 0.0001) and overall intubation success (OPS: 82 vs. 92%, p = 0.0001) [20] .

The investigation found that a trainee needs a range of approximately 100-150 intubation procedures performed to reach an overall success rate (OPS) of 95% [20] . There are no published studies to date reporting on the development of proficiency for endotracheal intubation under pre-hospital, Emergency Department, polytrauma, or severely injured in emergency situations. In clinical practice, only the most experienced providers perform airway support during these situations, and thus, the availability of such studies with inexperienced trainees can hardly be expected in the future. The evidence regarding proficiency during endotracheal intubation in well-observed and safe elective situations led to the key recommendation by the German Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine that endotracheal intubation should only be carried out by providers who have performed at least 100 endotracheal intubations overall and perform 10 intubations per year [164] . Regarding proficiency of securing the airway with alternative methods, a prospective monocenter study of first year residents (n = 10) and 394 patients compared placement success rates for the ProSeal laryngeal mask for the first five insertions and the 40th insertion. The first pass success increased from 72 to 86% (p = 0.09) and overall success from 74 to 96% (p = 0.001) [113] . The evidence regarding proficiency during alternative airway management in well-observed and safe elective situations led to the key recommendation by the German Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine that alternative airway placement should only be carried out as a primary procedure when the indications for endotracheal intubation listed above are not met or as a supraglottic alternative for a difficult airway, and by providers who have performed at least ten alternative airway placements overall and perform three alternative airway placements per year [164] . However, since the success of alternative methods for securing an airway (e.g., supraglottic airways: laryngeal mask, laryngeal tube) are only as good as the corresponding level of training for the procedure, and current evidence indicates that the appropriate level of training is not available everywhere [163] , endotracheal intubation continues to be the gold standard. These findings also illustrate that emergency medical personnel must be regularly trained in endotracheal intubation as well as alternative airway management [131] . This is particularly important because the experience level of the person securing the airway is negatively correlated with patient mortality. A systematic review study and meta-analysis showed higher mortality rates for patients with TBI intubated by less experienced providers in the pre-hospital setting (OR 2.33; 95 %-CI: 1.61-3.38, p \\ 0.001). In cases where experienced providers performed pre-hospital intubation, there was no increased mortality (OR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.52-1.08, p = 0.126). Meta-regression identified experience in airway management as a significant predictor for mortality of these patients (p = 0.009) [25] . Regarding emergency crichothyrotomy, a retrospective cohort study for the years of 2007 to 2013 found that of 493 airway protection procedures performed by ''ambulance nurses,'' a helicopter emergency physician detected and corrected failed intubation and hypoxia in 42% (8.5%) of cases [134] . For a further 1406 endotracheal intubations, there was a success rate of 98.4%. Seven patients were ventilated with bag-valve-mask ventilation (n = 2) and alternative airway support (n = 2); in 30 cases, surgical airway procedures (emergency crichothyrotomy n = 28 and tracheotomy n = 2) were performed; in three cases airway management was abandoned for non-survivable injuries. This data shows that a surgical airway is rarely necessary, but to perform it, the appropriate training is necessary and this measure can be life-saving [134] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 184, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 988, "end": 993, "text": "[164]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1377, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1951, "end": 1956, "text": "[164]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2271, "text": "[163]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2496, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3124, "end": 3128, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3418, "end": 3423, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3959, "end": 3964, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "In the literature, there are numerous references to standard operation procedures (SOPs) and checklists for anesthetic induction and airway management [114, 149] .

Thus, a difficult airway must always be anticipated when endotracheally intubating a trauma patient [131] . In a large study of 6088 trauma patients, risk factors and impediments to endotracheal intubation were foreign bodies in the pharynx or larynx, direct injuries to the head or neck with loss of normal upper airway anatomy, airway edema, pharyngeal tumors, laryngospasm, and difficult pre-existing anatomy [156] . In another study, a difficult airway was present more frequently in trauma patients (18 [78] . In a prospective study of 598 patients, adverse events and complications occurred significantly more often in patients with severe injuries than non-traumatized patients (p = 0.001) [162] . At least one event was documented in 31.1% of traumatized patients. The number of attempts required for intubation was also significantly increased in trauma patients (p = 0.007) [162] . Patients with severe maxillofacial trauma in particular show increased risk for difficult intubation (OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.9, p = 0.05) [41] . In fact, maxillofacial trauma represents an independent risk factor for difficult airway management (OR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-4.4, p = 0.038). A retrospective analysis of a trauma registry over seven years identified 90 patients with severe maxillofacial injuries. Of these, 93% initially received definitive airway protection, by means of endotracheal tube in 80% of cases and through a surgical airway in 15% [39] . Based on this data, the presence of blood, vomit or other fluids in the oropharynx is to be expected, and with it, a difficult intubation. The patient should also be assumed to be nonfasting. A high-performance suction unit must therefore be available as a matter of course. Because of structural and procedural considerations of the pre-hospital setting, backup with an experienced anesthesiologist often isn't possible. In-hospital, however, the standard is for an anesthesiologist to participate in the anesthesia and intubation of patients expected to be difficult. A prospective cohort study found that the presence of an attending anesthesiologist at in-hospital emergency intubations resulted in significantly fewer complications (6.1 versus 21.7%, p \\ 0.0001) [147] . However, there was no difference in the number of ventilator-free days or the 30-day mortality rate. If endotracheal airway protection fails, oxygenation must be ensured using an appropriate algorithm to revert to bag-valve-mask ventilation and/or alternative methods of airway management [5, 27, 79, 130, 131] . Treatment Recommendations for Pre-hospital Airway Management by the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine and the Treatment Recommendations for Pre-Hospital Emergency Anesthesia in Adults suggest readiness and implementation of alternative methods for airway protection [19] [164] . In a prospective study, intubation success was evaluated in 598 patients in an emergency physician system staffed solely by anesthesiologists. Endotracheal intubation was successful at the first attempt in 85.4% of all patients, and the second attempt in 10.4%. Only 2.7% required more than two attempts; in 1.5% (n = 9), alternative methods such as the supralaryngeal combitube (n = 7), laryngeal mask (n = 1) or an emergency cricothyroidotomy (n = 1) were used after the third unsuccessful intubation attempt [162] .

In a retrospective study of 2833 patients intubated in-hospital at a Level I trauma center, the risk of airway-associated complications was markedly increased with more than 2 intubation attempts: hypoxemia 11.8 vs. 70%, regurgitation 1.9 vs. 22%, aspiration 0.8 vs. 13%, bradycardia 1.6 vs. 21%, cardiac arrest 0.7 vs. 11% [117] . Another prospective, multicenter study examined the number of intubation attempts (through the oropharynx) necessary for successful endotracheal intubation in emergency patients over an 18-month period [176] . Endotracheal intubation was carried out by paramedics in 94% of cases and by nurses or emergency physicians in the remaining 6%. Overall, 1941 intubations were carried out, of which 1272 (65.5%) occurred in patients with cardiac arrest, 463 (23.9%) were performed without drug administration in patients without cardiac arrest, 126 (6.5%) occurred under sedation in patients without cardiac arrest, and 80 (4.1%) took place by rapid sequence induction using a hypnotic agent and a muscle relaxant. Over 30% of patients required more than one attempt to achieve successful endotracheal intubation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 109, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 440, "end": 444, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 771, "end": 776, "text": "[117]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 981, "end": 986, "text": "[176]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1606"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "More than 6 intubation attempts were not reported in any case.

The specific success rates were not further differentiated according to provider type (paramedics, nurses and emergency physicians). The results of this study [176] show that the cumulative success rate of endotracheal intubation in a paramedic system is markedly below that of emergency physician systems staffed solely by anesthesiologists, with rates of 97-100% [78, 162, 165] . In addition, the use of medications, e.g. those used in rapid sequence induction (including muscle relaxants), helps facilitate intubation in patients without cardiac arrest and thus leads to a markedly higher success rates. Both are often crucial to survival during an emergency situation. According to the abovecited study and other study results [18, 55, 73, 74, 95, 109, 117, 138] , alternative methods must be considered to secure an airway after two unsuccessful intubation attempts [5, 117] . In particular, it must be considered that the intubation success rate after the second attempt by inexperienced providers is \\ 1% in elective anesthesia [20] .

However, a correctly positioned c-spine immobilization device restricts the mouth opening and thus, the ability to insert a laryngoscope during an intubation maneuver. The c-spine immobilizer prevents reclination of the head. Thus, a prospective multi-center study reported cervical spine immobilization as a cause of a difficult endotracheal intubation [100] . For this reason, c-spine immobilizers are replaced by manual in-line stabilization (MILS) during endotracheal intubation. In such a case, the c-spine is immobilized by an assistant using both hands to manually immobilize the c-spine. The consequent direct laryngoscopy under MILS was the standard of care in emergency situations for many years. However, MILS is not without controversy, and some negative effects have been reported [108, 145] . As an alternative to direct laryngoscopy, fiberoptic intubation by an experienced provider is the gold standard of care for conscious and spontaneously breathing, hemodynamically stable patients inhospital [24, 131] . Current data show that video laryngoscopy allows good laryngeal visualization when the c-spine immobilizer is in place, so that it can be used here as an alternative procedure [29, 83, 84, 160] . [150] . Additional prehospital studies of trauma patients appear to support these observations [84] . Currently, the high price of a video laryngoscope is often cited as an argument against use in the pre-hospital setting. However, the first studies in the pre-hospital setting have given overwhelming evidence in favor of video laryngoscopy. In a prospective monocenter observational study in an air rescue system with a high trauma fraction of 71.5%, VL was successful in 227 of 228 patients (99.6%), and supraglottic airway was necessary in only one case (0.4%) [83] . In 57 of these patients, who were treated by experienced anesthesiologists, vocal cord visualization was improved from CL grade III/IV with DL to grade I/II with VL (p \\ 0.001). Similar positive results were achieved during intubations by U.S. paramedics using VL in a retrospective data analysis of an air rescue system over a nineyear period with 790 emergency patients with a trauma fraction of 60%. Here, VL showed a higher FPS than DL (94.9 vs. 75.4%, p \\ 0.0001) [23] . VL increased the success rate of endotracheal intubation within two attempts (97.4 vs. 89 .2%, p = 0.0002). The overall intubation success rate using VL was also significantly higher than with DL (99.0 vs. 94.9%, p \\ 0.011). In addition, VL reduced the average number of intubation attempts until success (1.08 vs. 1.33, p \\ 0.0001) and the need to use supraglottic airways by group (0.5 vs. 3.2%, p = 0.036) [23] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 510, "end": 515, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 950, "end": 955, "text": "[108,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "145]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1173, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1178, "text": "131]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1361, "text": "[29,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1365, "text": "83,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1369, "text": "84,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1370, "end": 1374, "text": "160]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1382, "text": "[150]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1476, "text": "[84]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1946, "text": "[83]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2422, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2514, "text": "(97.4 vs. 89", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2834, "end": 2838, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "The advantage of VL is particularly evident with c-spine immobilization.

Animal studies have found decreased mortality when Ringer's Malate is used. The challenge of the slight hypoosmolarity of Ringer's Lactate and the associated potential for increased cerebral edema after traumatic brain injury is not present with Ringer's Acetate/Malate solutions, since these are completely isoosmolar [55, 82] . In summary, the use of Ringer's Lactate is no longer worthy of recommendation. Because of the clear limitations for HES in volume replacement, other colloids like gelatin or albumin have experienced a renaissance. However, the use of albumin appears to be associated with increased mortality after severe trauma, and because of additional logistical reasons like the need for cooling and glass bottles, it is not recommended [32, 36] . Regarding the use of gelatin, there is the risk of an immune reaction. In 1977, Ring et al. published a study in Lancet that this risk is significantly higher than for other colloids (probability of an immune reaction: HAES 0.006%, dextran 0.0008%, gelatin 0.038%) [59] .

Transurethral catheterization should thus be avoided in patients with clinical signs of urethral injury, until further diagnostic studies can be performed.

Potential causes for improved outcomes in multiply injured patients include shorter pre-hospital times (time of accident until hospital admission) as well as more aggressive pre-hospital management. Whether the use of air rescue services actually leads to decreased mortality, however, has remained controversial. Newer studies, some based on data from the DGU trauma registry database (TraumaRegister DGU\u00d2), seem to have found recognizable positive effects from air rescue, at least in Germany [2, 23] . More recent studies focus less on the value of air rescue itself, and more on, e.g., whether operations should be expanded to 24 hours. Regarding pre-hospital management, up to 40% of polytrauma patients are treated by ground and air rescue teams together [48] . The importance of pre-hospital treatment time may need to be reevaluated. On the other hand, pre-hospital treatment time was also found to be approximately 16 minutes longer with air rescues than with ground rescue alone [2] . The reasons for this are primarily logistical aspects like the post-alarm of the air rescue service instead of immediate parallel alarm, such as can be seen e.g., in the BoLuS study (ground and air rescue interface, multi-centric cross-system interface analysis) from Hessen. The need for the sometimes enormous logistical costs for trauma centers was also examined. In addition to more complex technology, personnel resources in particular are necessary for optimal logistical support of multiply injured patients. To date, healthcare research has not yielded a clear evidence-based need for organization of trauma management within the DGU Trauma Network S92 (TraumaNetzwerk DGU\u00d2, TNW) and the trauma centers of that structure, but this is most likely because no structured data is available for comparison prior to the introduction of the TNW. One current study from Schweigkofler et al. reported improved survival for severely injured patients when treated with air rescue and hospital treatment [35, 36, 38, 39] in a national trauma center [50] .

It is important here to distinguish between isolated mechanical instability and hemodynamic instability, although both can also occur together. Evidence of instability should promote increased awareness of the hemodynamic situation. Instability should be differentiated according to iliac wing hinging inwards or outwards, internal and external rotation. In cases of translational instability, there can be craniocaudal instability in the horizontal plane or anterior-posterior instability in the sagittal plane. In addition to the increased bleeding risk, instability can lead to further complications such as thrombosis and secondary nerve, vascular, and organ injuries. The latter can be primary injuries and must be excluded during the primary diagnostic survey in unstable pelvic injuries. Pelvic instability should be managed with early surgery. Depending on patient condition, this can be a quick damage control procedure, or direct definitive treatment (more time intensive). There is consensus, however, that mechanical stabilization (regardless of method) has highest priority and should ideally be performed at the scene of the accident. Hemostasis has a similarly high priority and should be implemented according to the available alternatives. Signs of pelvic instability can be identified on diagnostic imaging. These include, for example, widening of the public symphysis or the SI joints. Displacement of the iliac wings horizontally or vertically should also be considered a sign of instability. It should be kept in mind that displacement is frequently much greater at the time of trauma than at the time of diagnosis.

On the other hand, reliable stabilization with an external fixator is not always possible when there is posterior instability. Siegmeth et al. [55] theorize that an external fixator is sufficient for instability of the anterior pelvic ring, but that injuries to the posterior pelvic ring need additional compression in an emergency.

Although Croce [13] reported benefits of the pelvic girdle in his study, these findings were not confirmed by Ghaemmaghami et al. [25] . One important change, however, is that in recent years, the use of pelvic girdles and other non-invasive external stabilization techniques has increasingly established itself in the pre-hospital setting.

Circulatory decompensation does not emerge gradually, but appears suddenly, because pediatric physiology offers few compensation possibilities. Emergency stabilization of the pelvis can be performed with simple compression bilaterally, manually if needed. There are no large series of studies on pediatric pelvic fractures available in the literature.

There are no reports of the use of a pelvic C-clamp in children. The need for volume replacement and surgical hemostasis are applicable just as in adults. Regarding diagnostic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the advantage versus CT that it depicts non-ossified structures and thus, enables multiplanar characterization of a pelvic injury. Plain x-rays have a significantly weaker predictive value than computed tomography as a diagnostic study of bony pelvic structures and can be used as a complement or completely omitted according to Guillamondegui et al.

The reasons for this are radiographic studies that are inadequately or not at all performed, or inconsistent follow up on necessary diagnostic assessments [46, 88, 90, 117] , which is why unconscious patients without imaging of C0-C3 and/or C6/C7 should be evaluated with CT [20, 139] . 20 % of spine injuries are overlooked because diagnostic assessment is not complete [16, 34] . This has been confirmed with data from 39 polytrauma patients, of whom nine had C-spine injuries, only six of whom could be diagnosed with conventional x-ray. In the remaining three patients, however, additional studies (1x functional views and 2x CT) were required [124] . The ''polytrauma'' diagnosis itself involves a considerable risk that important injuries will be overlooked on the primary survey [113] . Fifty percent of missed injuries in polytrauma are spine injuries. One result of this is prolonged hospitalization time and need for additional surgeries [117] . Thus, in polytrauma it is recommended to routinely image the entire spine [36, 100] .

Another practical advantage of CT diagnosis is the markedly more rapid clearing of the spine compared to conventional radiography [57, 60, 61] , because inadequate images, for example of the cervico-thoracic junction, almost never occur. Generally, diagnostic CT is performed with intravenous contrast medium. CT is also considered beneficial in children, even though the radiation dose, with approximately 400 mRem (Millirem), is higher than that of conventional radiographs (150-300 mRem), according to a pseudorandomized study [1] . Despite the problem mentioned above, it is recommended that children maximize their chances for clinical findings [54] . Basically, the emergency department approach to trauma in children does not differ from that in adults. Detected spine injuries should not undergo surgery without CT [64] , as assessment and classification of the fracture often change significantly after CT compared to the initial plain x-ray [57, 59] . Preoperative CT imaging and analysis is particularly important in fractures with rotational instability [127] . The spiral CT from head to pelvis, without conventional radiographs, is particularly suitable for evaluation of the spine in polytrauma because it saves time, is more reliable than conventional radiographs, requires fewer positioning maneuvers, and is less expensive [97] . If the spine is normal on CT, additional conventional radiographs are superfluous [21, 22, 28, 108, 119] , because the negative predictive value is almost 100 %.

CT is significantly more accurate than conventional radiography for C-spine injuries. In a study of 70 patients, conventional radiography identified 38 with C-spine injuries, while CT identified 67 [123] . A current meta-analysis [66] and the review studies by Crim et al. 2001 [33] and Link et al. 1994 [83] found similar results. Conventional lateral x-ray views detected 60-80 % of C-spine injuries, and CT 97-100 % [103] (Table 2) . Additional studies have found that CT layer thickness affects diagnostic accuracy [59] , which must be taken into account when evaluating older studies using CT equipment that would be obsolete by today's standards. Based on figures in the literature, Blackmore et al. also concluded that primary diagnostic CT offers better clinical and cost-effective results compared to conventional radiography in patients with average to high risk of spine injuries [15] . CT examination of the C-spine offers not only accurate assessment of bony injuries, but also detects disco-ligamentous injuries, which are associated with instability. Vanguri et al. [143] demonstrated this, where disco-ligamentous instability was detected on CT in 38 % of cases.

In particular, lesions of the spinal cord, the intervertebral discs, and the ligaments can be visualized [33, 48, 76] . However, Patton et al. [102] consider the search for ligamentous injuries with MRI superfluous, considering the rarity of this injury. No studies have directly compared conventional functional views and MRI images; thus, both options seem to be worth recommending. With sensitivity of only 12 % and specificity of 97 %, MRI is not suitable for the detection of fractures [77] . MRI is indicated over the course of follow up for neurological symptoms and has partially replaced functional views for defined situations, for example in Hangman fractures [74] . In general, there is no need to worry about false negative results, but specificity is low [20] . If a neurological deficit is present without correlating morphology on CT, MRI of the corresponding section of the spine is urgent.

Caution is required during closed reduction without operative stabilization and/or disc removal, as the disc can herniate posteriorly, with detrimental neurological effects [51] . On the basis of three randomized studies [18, 98, 104] , a Cochrane review [17] found that methylprednisolone improves neurological outcomes a year after trauma compared to placebo, when it is given within 8 hours of trauma. The recommended dose (NASCIS protocol) is methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg body weight i.v. over 15 minutes within the first 8 hours after trauma, then 5.4 mg/kg BW per hour for 23 hours. The NASCIS-3 study found that administration of methylprednisolone over 48 hours showed a tendency for improved results [19] and was recommended there for patients in whom therapy was begun 3 hours or more after trauma. In cases of verified neurological symptoms with corresponding CT confirmation of spinal cord narrowing, the NASCIS (National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study) protocol can be begun at an early stage [9] . This can shorten rehabilitation time.

In recent years, a series of algorithms have been published taking the specifics of TCA into account. The ERC guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation 2015 discuss the divergent approaches to TCA versus non-traumatic cardiac arrest. In TCA, the response time is critical, and outcome depends on a well-established chain of survival, from advanced pre-hospital management to trauma center care. Chest compressions are the basic measure for cardiac arrest of all kinds, regardless of etiology. In cases of hypovolemia, tension pneumothorax, or pericardial tamponade, however, chest compressions are not as effective as they are in non-traumatic cardiac arrest. In cases of hypovolemia or obstructive forms of shock like tension pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade, the end diastolic filling volume remains low despite correctly performed external cardiac massage, even in normovolemic patients. Because of this, chest compressions have lower priority in TCA compared to immediate treatment of the abovementioned reversible causes (e.g., thoracotomy, hemorrhage control) [65] . However, this approach diverges significantly from the universal ALS algorithm for nontraumatic cardiac arrest, in which cardiac etiologies predominate (see also ''non-traumatic etiology'' section).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 43, "end": 46, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 47, "end": 50, "text": "31,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 51, "end": 54, "text": "38,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 55, "end": 58, "text": "57,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 59, "end": 62, "text": "58,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 63, "end": 66, "text": "65]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1376, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Resuscitation"}, {"text": "Key recommendation:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Criteria for Cardiac Arrest"}, {"text": "Recommendation Modified 2016 GoR A When there are no vital signs, when there is uncertainty regarding a pulse, or when there are other clinical signs suggesting likely cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures must begin immediately.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2.85"}, {"text": "Cardiac arrest after trauma itself is not a hopeless situation [31] .

In the meantime, further evidence has been collected regarding outcomes after treatment for traumatic cardiac arrest, and they are more much more positive. In an evaluation of the DGU Trauma Registry of 10 359 patients from 1993-2004, 17.2 % of polytrauma patients were successfully resuscitated after traumatic cardiac arrest, 9.7 % with moderate to good S164 neurological outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale GOS C 4, Table 14 ). 77 (10 %) of the resuscitated patients underwent emergency thoracotomy with a survival rate of 13 % [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 63, "end": 67, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 382, "end": 386, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 916, "end": 920, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 804, "end": 812, "text": "Table 14", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "Other more recent studies have reported survival rates up to 29 % [27, 31, 36, 49, 54, 58, 64, 68] .

Now it must be assumed that traumatic cardiac arrest can be survived more often and with better neurological outcomes than was previously believed. The criteria for detecting cardiac arrest in trauma patients is distinct from those detecting cardiac arrest from non-traumatic causes. There are differences in the recognition of impending cardiac arrest [6, 48, 60] . Clinical signs of unsurvivable injury as well as potentially reversible causes of death are unreliable. The ''Casper sign,'' known from legal medicine, describes severe internal injuries without visible external injuries.

In previous resuscitation guidelines, state of consciousness, breathing, and circulation were checked with highest priority [23, 24] . In the meantime, however, studies have found that both evaluation for spontaneous breathing [14, 53] and especially checking for a pulse [14, 17] are fraught with high error rates, even when performed by trained personnel.

The treatment of severe hypovolemic shock consists of several elements. The most important principle is hemostasis without delay, which usually happens through surgical measures, but can also be achieved with radiological interventions if necessary. If hypovolemia is the cause of cardiac arrest, the success rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be increased with hemostasis and volume replacement [1, 26] .

DCR combines permissive hypotension and aggressive coagulation therapy with ''damage control surgery,'' surgical damage control aimed at temporary stabilization of injuries without additional surgical trauma. In cases of unclear evidence, there is general consensus to restrict intravenous fluids until bleeding is surgically controlled. With permissive hypotension, just enough volume is given to maintain a radial pulse [4, 25, 33, 64] .

Accordingly, the German Medical Association (Bundes\u00e4rztekammer, B\u00c4 K) recommends that the goal should be a hemoglobin concentration around 10 g/dl (6.2 mmol/ l), due to the favorable effects of higher hematocrit values on primary hemostasis in cases of massive, acutely bleeding hemorrhages until the time of hemostasis [20] . The 2004 review study by Hardy et al. [58] supports this B\u00c4 K recommendation with experimental evidence that hematocrit levels up to 35 % are necessary to maintain hemostasis in bleeding patients. The B\u00c4 K emphasizes that Hb value alone is not an indication for transfusion; rather, the capability for physiologic compensation and signs of anemic hypoxia should be considered [20] . Thus, it is possible that in individual cases the goal should be Hb values [ 10 g/dl [3, 152] . In cases of massively bleeding patients, it can be necessary to begin transfusion of pRBCs and FFP and plasma derivatives if needed before reaching the Hb target range of 7-9 g/dl due to other causes (e.g. hypoxemia, shock, etc.). A Cochrane review from 2012 examined 19 studies of 6264 patients (a general patient population, not specific to trauma patients with active bleeding!). The restrictive transfusion trigger (7-9 g/dl) did not appear to affect the rate of side effects (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, arrhythmia, thromboemboli) compared to liberal transfusion strategies (9-12 g/dl). The restrictive strategy was linked to a significant reduction of hospital mortality (RR 0.77; 95 CI: 0.62-0.95), but not 30-day mortality (RR 0.85; 95 CI: 0.70 -1.03) [24] . The analysis of 391 985 inpatients found that reduction of average Hb values to 7.6 g/dl prior to transfusion did not significantly worsen the 30-day mortality [136] . Analysis of two studies of 549 patients refusing transfusion showed that mortality is extremely high in post-operative care without transfusion for Hb under 5-6 g/dl. The probability of death increased in patients with post-operative Hb B 8 g/dl, calculated around 2.5 times per gram of Hb decrease. There were no deaths in the Hb range of 7-8 g/dl: however, there was a cardiovascular and/or infectious morbidity of 9.4 % [25, 147] . The authors of the 3rd ET offer a grade 1C recommendation (Rec. 17) for a target Hb of 7-9 g/dl after hemostasis; however, the text specifies that the optimal Hb/Hct for stabilization of coagulation in massively bleeding patients is unclear [150] . In the case of TIC, a restrictive transfusion trigger can be unfavorable [114] , since significant impairment of coagulation can develop before oxygenation is affected [59] . Similarly, neurological outcomes can be worse when there are lower Hb values after resuscitation (e.g., Hb \\ 10 g/dl after resuscitation for non-traumatic cardiac arrest + poor cerebral saturation + poor central venous saturation) [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 866, "end": 870, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 958, "end": 961, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 962, "end": 966, "text": "152]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1758, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1926, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2352, "end": 2356, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2357, "end": 2361, "text": "147]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2610, "text": "[150]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2691, "text": "[114]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2785, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3019, "end": 3022, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "2.116"}, {"text": "A possible correlation between pRBC transfusion with poorer outcomes is intensely debated, and better data through prospective studies is needed [171] .

As an acute phase protein, levels can increase up to 20 times during inflammation and thus, also in association S182 with TIC [113] . Factor I (i.e., fibrinogen) is a clotting substrate essential not only for the formation of the fibrin network but also as a ligand for the GPIIb-IIIa receptor on the platelet surface, and thus, responsible for platelet aggregation. In the context of dilution or severe bleeding, fibrinogen seems to be the most vulnerable of all coagulation factors and is the first to reach its critical concentration [20, 63, 68] . In cases of TIC, fibrinogen is reduced not only by hyperfibrinolysis, but also by increased degradation, acidosis, reduced synthesis as a result of hypothermia as well as loss/dilution [6] . According to B\u00c4 K, the minimum plasma concentration following fibrinogen replacement must be 1.0 g/l. The critical threshold where spontaneous bleeding can occur is \\ 1.5 g/l in cases of heavy bleeding (cross-sectional guideline 7.1.6.2). In adults, generally a single dose of 3-6 g is required. The administration of 3 g of fibrinogen in 3 liters of plasma increases the measured fibrinogen concentration by approximately 1 g/l. In the case of congenital deficiency, the half-life of 96-120h should be considered. In cases of shorter half-life, the fibrinogen concentrations are more frequently controlled (Cross-Sectional Guideline 7.1.7) [20] . Already in 1995, Hiippala [67] determined that in patients receiving colloid infusions, the measurement of ''derived'' fibrinogens (determined with the PT/INR) as well as those determined with the Clauss method were significantly higher than the actual fibrinogen levels. The B\u00c4 K recommends that patients who have received hydroxyethyl starch preparations or dextran and whose fibrinogen levels are determined with the ''derived fibrinogen method'' should be treated with an intervention threshold of 1.5 g/l instead of 1.0 g/l. When hyperfibrinolysis is suspected, an antifibrinolytic (e.g., 1 g tranexamic acid) should be given beforehand [20] . The following presents studies regarding fibrinogen replacement in acute bleeding and controls, grouped according to size and profile and thus, enabling conclusions based on the study results. Recently, Hagemo et al [41] published a multicenter study (International Trauma Research Network, INTRN) of 808 patients from four trauma centers in England, Denmark, and Norway (2007-2011) with the goal to reevaluate smaller cohort studies to characterize TIC and to evaluate the threshold values for fibrinogen concentrations (VET); they found that MT was necessary in 6.1 % of cases, and that TIC was present in 11 %. The most important conclusions came in addition to the results stated above (VET as a valid method for threshold determination of fibrinogen concentration), which confirmed the results of earlier cohort studies that the Clauss method determinations were comparable with the best parameters of VET, and that future studies should be planned to test coagulation therapy guided by VET in trauma. Hagamo et al. published a multicenter study of 1133 patients treated within three hours in a trauma center. They examined the initial fibrinogen concentrations (prevalence of hypofibrinogenemia), as there is still little evidence regarding the use of fibrinogen in the acute phase. In 8.2 %, the fibrinogen concentration was B 1.5 g/l, and in 19.2 %, it was \\ 2.0 g/l. With initial concentrations under 2.29 g/l, there was a marked increase in the 28-day mortality. The average initial fibrinogen concentration of 28 day survivors was 2.68 g/l and it was 1.95 g/l in nonsurvivors (p\\0.001). With fibrinogen concentrations under 2.29 g/dl (95% CI: 1.93-2.64), there was a 90 % reduction in mortality for each unit increase of fibrinogen concentration, although the results must be interpreted cautiously due to the large confidence intervals. The authors recommended that these results be validated using interventional studies with fibrinogen concentrates [56] . A larger prospective cohort study of 517 patients from Rouke et al. was devoted to the course of fibrinogen concentrations, monitored with VET and Clauss method determination. The blood samples were collected at admission and after transfusion of four units pRBCs. Low fibrinogen levels on admission were independently associated with ISS (p = 0.002), shock (p = 0.002), and the quantity of pre-hospital volume given (p \\ 0.001). Fibrinogen concentrations varied significantly between non-survivors after 24 hours (1.1 g/l vs. 2.3 g/l, p \\ 0.001) and after 28 days (1.4 g/l vs. 2.4 g/l, p\\0.001) [137] . Other studies are mostly monocentric cohort studies examining fibrinogen replacement in smaller patient groups. When a concentration of \\ 2 g/l is used as indication for fibrinogen substitution (average 2 g, range 1-5 g), Fenger-Eriksen et al. found significant reductions in the need for pRBCs (p \\ 0.0001), FFP (p \\ 0.0001), and PC (p \\ 0.001) as well as blood loss (p \\ 0.05) in 35 heavily bleeding adult patients [40] . In a retrospective analysis of 30 massively bleeding patients with hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen \\ 1.5 g/l) of varying etiologies, Weinkove et al. raised the level from 0.65 to 2.01 g/l (Clauss method) with administration of 4 g fibrinogen (median; range 2-14 g) [166] . In a retrospective analysis, Farriols Danes et al. found that patients (n = 81) with acute, bleeding-related hypofibrinogenemia (substitution below 1 g/l) react with a marked increase on fibrinogen replacement and, in contrast to patients with chronic fibrinogen deficiency (p = 0.314), they have a significantly better 7-day survival rate (p = 0.014) [34] . In an in vitro study, the blood of subjects (n = 6) was diluted 1:5 with NaCl 0.9 % solution. To optimize the rate of clot formation, a fibrinogen concentration[2 g/l was necessary. The results of this in vitro study cannot be directly transferred to a clinical situation, and must be prospectively verified with clinical studies [130] . Matched-pair analysis (registry study; n = 294 patients per group) with data from the DGU Trauma Registry found that patients receiving fibrinogen concentrates between admission and the ICU showed significantly decreased 6-hour mortality (10.5 % vs. 16.7 %, p = 0.03), prolonged time until death, but also an increased rate of multi-organ failure, although the overall mortality during admission did not vary compared to patients receiving no fibrinogen (28.6% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.40). These results should be verified with prospective, randomized controlled studies [161] . In a prospective cohort study of 144 patients with ISS [ 15 by Innerhofer et al., 66 patients were treated with fibrinogen and/or PPSB concentrate (CF group) and 78 patients received additional FFP (FFP group). Patients treated with fibrinogen concentrates and/or PPSB received significantly less pRBCs and PC than those receiving additional FFP (pRBCs median 2, range 0-4 units vs. median 9, range 5-12 units; PC median 0, range 0-0 units vs. median 1, range 0-2 units; p \\ 0.001). In addition, patients of the CF group showed less multi-organ failure (18.2% vs 37.2%, p 0.01) and sepsis (16.9% vs. 35.9 %, p = 0.014) [77] . In a prospective in vitro study comparing 63 trauma versus 63 critically ill non-trauma patients, thrombopenia \\ 150 x10 9 /l and fibrinogen concentration \\ 2 g/l were the only factors associated with enhanced bleeding tendency, according to special measurements with the TEG (MA) [70] . A retrospective analysis evaluated fibrinogen concentrations of 290 patients on admission (3- year period, level I trauma center). In this retrospective analysis of 290 blunt trauma patients, fibrinogen concentration \\ 2 g/l on admission was an independent predictor for 7-day mortality [88] . A retrospective analysis of 260 trauma patients (average ISS 26 \u00b1 13) with massive transfusions (C 10 units pRBCs within the first 24 hours) divided patients into three groups according to fibrinogen concentration on admission: normal (C180 mg/dL), abnormal (C101 to \\ 180 mg/dL), and critical (B100 mg/ dL). A value B 100 mg/dl led to significantly increased 24h mortality (adjusted OR 3.97; adjusted p = 0.013; R 2 = 0.141), significantly increased hospital mortality, and was the most important independent predictor for mortality (p = 0.012). The impact of a fibrinogen replacement strategy requires prospective evaluation [75] . There is evidence that a fibrinogen concentration C 2 g/l can be advisable in trauma patients with acute bleeding, but there are no large prospective RCTs. Once the acute bleeding is controlled, the fibrinogen concentration should not drop below 1.5 g/l. The costs for fibrinogen concentrates are not reimbursed by the state health insurance for every case, especially in emergency therapy. Currently (DRG 2016), fibrinogen cannot be billed through additional charges in polytrauma patients (exceptions: congenital coagulation deficiencies, exceeding a total sum of clotting factors). For cost reasons and because there is a lack of randomized multicenter studies proving a survival benefit at higher target thresholds for fibrinogen replacement, the previous threshold of 1.5 g/l for fibrinogen replacement was maintained, and the 1C recommendations of the 3rd ET (Rec. 27 [150] ) and the ESA (Rec. 7.1.2 [91] ) of 1.5-2 g/l were not adopted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 252, "end": 257, "text": "[113]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 663, "end": 667, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 668, "end": 671, "text": "63,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 672, "end": 675, "text": "68]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 863, "end": 866, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1514, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1547, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2159, "end": 2163, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2382, "end": 2386, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4129, "end": 4133, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4732, "end": 4737, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5157, "end": 5161, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5428, "end": 5433, "text": "[166]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5788, "end": 5792, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6125, "end": 6130, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6697, "end": 6702, "text": "[161]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7324, "end": 7328, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7612, "end": 7616, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7709, "end": 7712, "text": "(3-", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7906, "end": 7910, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8540, "end": 8544, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9421, "end": 9426, "text": "[150]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9453, "end": 9457, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Platelet Concentrates (PC):"}, {"text": "There is very little data currently available regarding adverse effects of fibrinogen (concentrates).

Because fibrinogen has a long half-life (approximately 3-4 days) and there is a risk of accumulation at high or repeated doses, the risk of thromboemboli can be increased.

This indication has been validated in many studies; for patients taking Vitamin K antagonists, the B\u00c4 K [20] recommends pre-operative administration of PPSB for bleeding prophylaxis. In TIC, the prothrombin complex deficiency can be so pronounced that FFP administration must be supplemented with PPSB S184 [20, 141] . In cases of severe bleeding, the B\u00c4 K recommends an initial bolus of 20-25 IE/kg BW; significant individual variations in effectiveness must be considered [20] . The weak 2C recommendation of the 3rd ET includes a note that PPSB administration is coupled to the thromboelastometric signs of delayed initiation of coagulation (Rec. 31.2 [150] ). Thus, after PPSB administration, careful laboratory monitoring of coagulation should be performed. Joseph et al. compared the administration of FFP alone or in combination with PPSB in 252 polytrauma patients (median ISS 27) [81] . Supplemental PPSB resulted in faster normalization of INR (394 vs. 1050 min; p = 0.001), reduced consumption of pRBCs (6.6 vs. 10 units; p = 0.001) and FFP (2.8 vs. 3.9; p = 0.01) as well as reduced mortality (23 vs. 28%; p = 0.04).

In trauma patients, PPSB administration leads to a sustained and pronounced increase in endogenous thrombin potential as well as reduced anti-thrombin levels; both can cause an increased risk for thromboembolic events [146] . These adverse effects have also been reported in association with the rapid suspension of vitamin K antagonist activity during surgery. In a retrospective review study with data from twelve hospitals (n = 193), Hedges et al. reported that eight patients (approximately 4 %) suffered acute venous thromboemboli after PPSB [64] .

Administration of antifibrinolytics must be included in the overall coagulopathy management concept, since in hyperfibrinolysis there is often a heavy consumption of fibrinogen up to and including complete defibrination of the patient [17] .

Accordingly, TxA (or placebo) was infused as an initial bolus (1 g over ten minutes) followed by 1 g over 8 hours. After the inclusion of 10 060 patients (TxA group) and 10 067 patients (placebo), the primary endpoint of mortality was reduced with TxA (14.5 % vs. 16 .0 %, p = 0.0035), absolute mortality risk reduction (AMRR) = 1.5 %: number needed to treat (NNT) 67. Bleeding-related mortality was also reduced (4.9 % vs. 5.7 %, p = 0.0077, NNT 119). There was no significant variation in the secondary endpoints of thromboembolic events (1.7% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.084), need for surgical intervention (47.9% vs. 48.0%, p = 0.79), or transfusion of blood products (50.4% vs. 51.3%, p = 0.21). Despite the immense effort required for this study, no data regarding laboratory parameters, injury severity (e.g., injury severity score), or administration of other coagulation-active products/substances was documented. Although the study findings yield a recommendation level GoR A, one major criticism is that the majority of participating hospitals are located in developing countries where one cannot assume modern management of severely injured patients. In addition, the mechanism of action for TxA remains unclear; hemorrhage was not the main problem of the study population, since only 50.4 % of patients received blood transfusions (median 3, range 2-6 units pRBCs) and since of 3076 mortalities (15.3 %), only 1063 were bleeding-related. MATTERs, a retrospective study in the military sphere, found that treatment with 1 g TxA, followed as needed with one further gram, yielded an AMRR of 6.5 % (NNT = 15) for the patients overall and an AMRR of 13.7 % (NNT = 7) for massive transfusion patients [120] . Neither CRASH-2 nor MATTER were able to demonstrate reduced need for transfusions in trauma patients (in contrast to studies of a perioperative setting, e.g. [85] ). Based on the CRASH-2 data, the 3rd ET gave a 1A recommendation for the earliest possible administration of 1 G TxA over 10 min, followed by 1 g over 8 h, for all bleeding trauma patients (Rec. 24.1 [150] ).

The examination is based on a logistic regression model.

Huber-Wagner et al. also developed a WBCT score to aid decision-making using an analysis of 78 180 patients of the DGU Trauma Registry. Propensity score analysis was systematically performed. A score of 0-3 points indicates moderate benefit of performing WBCT. A score of -16 to -1 indicates no survival benefit for WBCT, of 4-16 shows benefit, and a score of 17-35 shows high survival benefit of WBCT. Scores are assigned as follows: intubation at trauma scene (+8), suspicion of injuries to C 3 body regions (+8), high energy trauma (+7), air rescue transport (+5), GCS B 14 (+3), suspicion of injuries to 2 body regions (+3), shock at trauma scene (+2), male gender (+2), penetrating trauma (-7), low fall\\3 m (-7), age\\70 years (-1), suspicion of injury to one body region (-1) [33] .

According to analyses of the trauma registry, the primary treatment for femoral shaft fractures in multiply injured patients by some German hospitals is, almost dogmatically, always with external fixators. In other hospitals, it is almost always with intramedullary nails, and finally, in many hospitals, there is every conceivable combination, sometimes with fixators and sometimes with nails [1] .

The benefits of operative decompression can be derived from several retrospective analyses [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 17] . Due to decades of consensual experience, the need for surgical intervention can be considered a basic incontrovertible assumption of good clinical practice [14] . Space-occupying intracranial injuries are an absolute, urgent indication for surgery. This applies both for traumatic intracranial bleeds (epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, intracerebral hematoma/contusion) as well as space-occupying impression fractures. The definition of space-occupying refers to a shift of cerebral structures, particularly the 3rd ventricle, which is normally located at the midline. In addition to findings on computed tomography (CT) (thickness, hematoma volume and location, magnitude of midline shift), clinical findings are crucial to the decision of whether and how rapidly operative intervention will take place.

This seems sensible for pathophysiological reasons, since clinical monitoring of many cerebral functions is S222 limited. In sedated patients, it can indicate imminent midbrain compression secondary to progressive swelling or expanding intracranial hematoma and thus, enable early countermeasures to be implemented. Although to date there have been no prospective randomized controlled studies comparing clinical results related to use of ICP monitoring [18] , several prospective as well as registry cohort studies [5, 16, 19, 22, 23, 29] in recent years have reported positive effects of ICP measurements on the overall course and outcomes. The much-discussed work of Chesnut et al. [12] did not find this positive association compared to close clinical monitoring and regular CT scans; however, in addition to the diverse criticism regarding the study's methodology, there is a question as to how well these results from Bolivia and Ecuador relate to our standard of care. For example, fewer than half of the patients were brought to the hospital in an official ambulance. The introduction of guidelines, which include ICP monitoring, also led to more favorable outcomes for TBI patients [15, 25] . ICP measurement is used for monitoring and as a guide to the management of unconscious TBI patients, considering the clinical course and the morphological findings on imaging. However, it is not necessary for every unconscious patient. ICP monitoring is also unnecessary in patients with hopeless prognosis and no meaningful therapeutic alternatives. Adequate cerebral perfusion requires sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), which can be easily calculated as the difference between the mean arterial blood pressure and mean ICP. The literature offers different answers to the question of whether the focus of treatment for increased ICP should be to decrease ICP or to maintain CPP. Evidence available to date suggests on the one hand that CPP should not fall below 50 mmHg [1, 3] , and on the other hand that it should not be raised through aggressive therapy to over 70 mmHg [1, 3] . Continuous CPP determination requires invasive ICP measurement. As long as the ventricles are not completely compressed, ICP monitoring via a ventricular drain offers an alternative to lower ICP through cerebrospinal fluid drainage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 203, "end": 220, "text": "[2-4, 11, 14, 23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 677, "end": 681, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 739, "end": 742, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 743, "end": 746, "text": "16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 747, "end": 750, "text": "19,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 751, "end": 754, "text": "22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 755, "end": 758, "text": "23,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 759, "end": 762, "text": "29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 908, "end": 912, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1418, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1422, "text": "25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2208, "end": 2211, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2214, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2311, "end": 2314, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2317, "text": "3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "The determination of the individual optimal CPP requires understanding of cerebral perfusion, oxygen supply and demand, and/or brain metabolism.

Explanation: An effective alternative for lowering elevated intracranial pressure is surgical decompression by craniectomy and expansive duraplasty, if necessary.

Other indications are expanding or pulsatile peri-renal hematomas [ 3.5 cm, contrast medium extravasation, and grade IV-V renal trauma [49, 63] . The goal of operative exploration of renal trauma is first hemostasis, if possible with suture of the defect (renorrhaphy) and drainage of the peri-renal hematoma or urinoma if necessary. The decision to operate is based, among other things, on the revised classification of kidney trauma according to Moore et al. and Buckley et al. [11, 48] : In 2011, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma amended the classification from 1989 [11] . Stages I-III remained unchanged [11] .

In a literature review summarizing several case series and comparative studies on the treatment for urethral ruptures, Koraitim reported the following rates of stricture, incontinence, and impotence. For suprapubic catheterization alone they were 97 %, 4 %, and 19 %; for primary stent placement rates were 53 %, 5 %, and 36 %; and for primary closure they were 49 %, 21 %, and 56 % [18, 24, 25, 27, [35] [36] [37] 50] . Correspondingly, in cases of complete urethral rupture in men, he recommends suprapubic catheterization or stent placement for larger gaps between the urethral ends [36] .

Especially when there is contamination of the abdominal cavity from colon injuries, primary closure of the urethra over a stenting catheter seems appropriate, to avoid a complicating infection [9] . Even in cases when a conservative approach appears possible, urethral injuries can be treated with primary surgery if definitive osteosynthesis of the bony pelvis cannot be performed without it [41] . Rupture of the anterior urethra in males are somewhat less common than of the posterior urethra [9] . Primary operative reconstruction can be necessary in cases of open injuries. In the majority of cases, however, preference should also be given here to suprapubic catheterization and delayed reconstruction, since reconstruction of the anterior urethra and the external male genitalia, which are often concomitantly affected, is usually difficult and time-consuming [14] . However, in cases of penis fracture with injury to the corpus spongiosum, it is recommended that the urethral injury also undergo primary surgery [14, 51] . The severity of the urological injury and the severity of the injuries overall are crucial to the selection of primary operative versus conservative management [14, 46] . Urethral injuries are significantly less common in female patients compared to men. When they do occur, however, they are very pronounced and associated with bladder injuries [14] . For this reason, primary treatment should consist of suprapubic catheterization alone, assuming that the patient is hemodynamically unstable and/or other injuries require more urgent operative care [68] . On the other hand, for women with less severe polytrauma, ruptures of the proximal urethra can undergo primary reconstruction through a retropubic approach [5, 52, 65] . These recommendations generally apply to children, with whom a similar distinction should be made according to gender. In a series of 35 boys with posterior urethral tears, Podest\u00e1 et al. 1997 compared suprapubic catheterization (with later urethroplasty), suprapubic catheterization with catheter splinting of the urethra, and primary anastomosis [57] . Since the continence rate after primary anastomosis only reached 50 %, and ten patients in the catheter splinting group eventually required urethroplasty, the authors recommended suprapubic catheterization with delayed secondary urethroplasty [57] . In a study of urethral injury in girls with pelvic fractures and other concomitant injuries, the same authors found the most advantage for delayed treatment, since good results were observed despite accompanying bladder and vaginal injuries [56] . Figure 11 : Algorithm for the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedure for Suspected Kidney Injuries [21] displaced during positioning maneuvers such as during treatment for chest trauma, there is an indication for primary operative stabilization [8, 13, 29, 67] . If there is a contraindication, the goal should be stabilization and decompression at the earliest possible time. This was confirmed by Fehlings et al. [23] . Here, the recommended goal is decompression within the first 24 hours. Our data shows significant improvements in neurological symptoms according to the ASIA protocol when decompression and stabilization are performed within the first six hours. Animal studies have found benefits regarding neurological symptoms for the earliest possible spine stabilization [18, 20] . [15] . According to the results of Aebi et al. [1] , immediate operative treatment of cervical spine injuries is more important for neurological outcomes than improved operative techniques. In a 2005 study, Kerwin et al. [30] found that primary stabilization of the spine in severely injured patients (ISS [ 25) shortened hospital stays from 29 to 20 days. The indications listed above are based on an assumption that the injury has undergone adequate assessment and diagnosis in the emergency department. The patient should be hemodynamically stable, and surgical causes of bleeding should be excluded. Additional vital parameters such as intracranial pressure, core body temperature, and coagulation should be in the normal range. If there is reasonable risk that primary reduction, decompression, and stabilization of the spine would significantly worsen the patient's condition, a spinal stabilization procedure is relatively contraindicated. If their condition is stable according to intracranial pressure, respiratory, and hemodynamic parameters, multiplyinjured patients benefit particularly from early management of spine injuries; there is stability for positioning maneuvers, and secondary ''hits'' from subsequent procedures can be avoided. In addition, the antigenic load created by an unstable fracture in close proximity to the trunk can be reduced. On the other hand, critical conditions such as hypothermia, mass transfusion, coagulopathy, pulmonary insufficiency, and higher catecholamine dependency are relative contraindications for immediate spinal stabilization. In this context, McLain and Benson 1999 [45] found that immediate (\\24 hours after trauma) stabilization achieved the same outcomes as early (24-72 hours after trauma) stabilization of an unstable spine fracture in patients with multiple injuries, neurological symptoms, and concomitant thoracoabdominal injuries. Nevertheless, the authors recommend stabilization at the earliest possible opportunity. Schlegel et al. [57] and Chipman et al. [12] reported that operative stabilization of unstable spine fractures within 72 hours was associated with decreased morbidity (fewer pulmonary complications, fewer urinary tract infections, shorter hospital and intensive care stays) in polytrauma patients. When an abdominal injury is present, which leads to laparotomy in 38 % of patients with spine fracture [6] , the decision of whether an unstable spine fracture must or can be stabilized during the same operative session must be made after the abdomen has been treated. In contrast, for cases of hemothorax, the presence of blood in the thorax itself supports early stabilization of an existing thoracic spine injury [16] . The results of Petitjean et al. [48] also support early stabilization of thoracic spine fractures for concomitant chest trauma with lung contusion S232 among other things. If there is primary paraplegia or unreducible dislocation, the operation can be postponed until organ functions are stabilized with intensive care. In conclusion, benefits for early surgery in polytrauma patients have been reported, particularly in recent publications from 2006 to 2010 [2, 4, 5, 11, 21-24, 31, 32, 43, 52, 54-56] . Early fracture stabilization and decompression enable favorable neurological shift, decrease general complications, and shorten hospital stays. Because general complications, particularly lung-related, occur frequently in polytrauma patients, the result is a recommendation for surgery to be performed as early as possible. et al., these measures are considered the damage control strategy for the spine in polytrauma [38] . When necessary, ventral fusion can be performed electively during the secondary operative phase. In addition, according to Been and Bouma, dorsal stabilization alone should be sufficient for burst fractures of the thoracic/lumbar spine [7] . Both logistical and technical effort as well as OR time must be considered for the various spine surgery methods. Laminectomy increases instability [1, 17, 41, 61, 71] and at best can serve as access to slide posterior edge fragments forward during dorsal decompression. It is debated whether the removal of bony fragments from the spinal canal (''spinal clearance'') is really clinically beneficial [9, 40, 66] . In this respect, the indication for laminectomy should be very narrow and considered only if there are neurological symptoms and compression caused by bone and disc fragments that cannot be removed from a ventral approach. Regarding blood loss and post-operative pain, percutaneous insertion of the internal fixator for dorsal stabilization of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae would be preferable to an open procedure. A study by Vanek et al. showed significant benefits for this. Screw malposition was not more frequently observed [63] . In cases of neurological deficits, however, an open approach is advisable, because laminectomy for decompression of the spinal cord must be performed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 193, "end": 196, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 392, "end": 395, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 695, "end": 698, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1070, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1223, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1227, "text": "51]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1394, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1398, "text": "46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1576, "end": 1580, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1785, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1947, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1951, "text": "52,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1952, "end": 1955, "text": "65]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2306, "end": 2310, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2556, "end": 2560, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2804, "end": 2808, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2908, "end": 2912, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3054, "end": 3057, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3058, "end": 3061, "text": "13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3062, "end": 3065, "text": "29,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3066, "end": 3069, "text": "67]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3224, "end": 3228, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3590, "end": 3594, "text": "[18,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3595, "end": 3598, "text": "20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3601, "end": 3605, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3648, "end": 3651, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3822, "end": 3826, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3907, "end": 3912, "text": "[ 25)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5225, "end": 5229, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5603, "end": 5607, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5627, "end": 5631, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5988, "end": 5991, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6301, "end": 6305, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6340, "end": 6344, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6767, "end": 6810, "text": "[2, 4, 5, 11, 21-24, 31, 32, 43, 52, 54-56]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7231, "end": 7235, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7361, "end": 7369, "text": "Been and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7474, "end": 7477, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7628, "end": 7631, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7632, "end": 7635, "text": "17,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7636, "end": 7639, "text": "41,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7640, "end": 7643, "text": "61,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7644, "end": 7647, "text": "71]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7880, "end": 7883, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7884, "end": 7887, "text": "40,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7888, "end": 7891, "text": "66]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 8427, "end": 8431, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2811, "end": 2820, "text": "Figure 11", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "La", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "S228"}, {"text": "Injuries of the upper extremity are common in multiply injured patients [1, 26] .

Severe extremity injuries lead to increased operative interventions and prolonged duration of treatment [1] .

This can be used to make an initial assessment of the depth of injury (grades 1 to 3). There is debate regarding whether blisters should be removed from superficial dermal lesions (grade 2a) [68, 90] . Proponents of blister retention postulate that the blister fluid creates a favorable wound-healing environment. In addition, pain intensity should be less and processes like cellular proliferation and angiogenesis are supported [64, 71] . In most German-speaking burn treatment centers, the blisters are removed during the initial treatment on admission. The reason is the high concentration of proinflammatory cytokines within the blister, which can lead to delayed wound healing. The protein-rich fluid within the blister also offers a fertile breeding ground for bacterial growth [41, 62] . In addition, after extensive initial debridement, circulatory disorders can be better detected and treated appropriately. When there are deep-grade, circular burn lesions around the hands, perfusion problems should be suspected. Immediate fasciotomy should be performed (for the technique, see the section on compartment syndrome). After completion of the primary operative measures, an antiseptic dressing should be applied. Moist dressings with clear, antiseptic substances (e.g., octenisept, polyhexanide) are preferred. For clearly superficial dermal lesions (grade 2a), hydrocolloid, PU foam, or membrane dressings can be applied after the initial care measures. When these biosynthetic dressings are used, re-epithelization of the area should occur within two weeks, due to the vital skin integument, among other things. There are other dressing arrangements known to support the regeneration process [39] . However, the decision to place these dressing systems can also be made during the reevaluation at 24 hours postinitial treatment. Silver sulfadiazine cream should not be used in superficial (grade 2a) and deep dermal (grade 2b) burns. In addition to impaired determination of injury depth, a meta-analysis found worse wound healing outcomes when silver sulfadiazine cream was applied [102] .

Of all published controlled studies examining femoral shaft fractures in polytrauma patients, only a minority have prospective or randomized study designs. The majority of papers were based on retrospective hospital data. Along with the primary objective criterion of mortality, there are numerous secondary outcomes: complication rates (from malunion to sepsis and organ failure), intensive care duration, ventilation parameters, cardiopulmonary changes, and hospital stay. Only a few authors backed up their treatment regimens with prospectively raised laboratory findings. Approximately one third of the investigations favored later treatment of the long bones, while two thirds considered early treatment superior. Other authors were undecided regarding the ideal timeframe. Most of the authors emphasized that there are particular patient groups (chest and/or brain injured patients) in whom one method is particularly (contra)indicated. Specifically, controlled studies on management strategies for isolated tibia fractures in polytrauma were not identified. In summary, early definitive operative stabilization is increasingly favored in the literature; however, the type and timing for this stabilization remain topics of debate. Thus, overall, it is best to take a risk profile-adjusted approach. In this way, the majority of severely injured patients who are hemodynamically stable within 24 hours can be safely treated primarily. Patients with hemodynamic instability, hemorrhagic shock, or a distinct combination of severe individual injuries should be initially managed with an external fixator as part of a damage control strategy. In borderline cases, particularly in patients with concomitant traumatic brain injury or lack of adequate improvement in hemodynamic and respiratory parameters despite extensive, initial ED and intensive care management (quantified by the lack of normalization of lactate levels as well as improved ventilation parameters), the decision to use external fixation as a damage control procedure should be liberal [32, 39] . Management strategies for multiple femoral and lower leg fractures in polytrauma patients have not yet been conclusively investigated. Although the reported incidence of multiple femur and tibia fractures suggests its clinical significance, with 2-7 %, it is rarely discussed in the literature. Most studies rely on retrospective hospital data (n = 42, 4-222 patients) and case reports (n = 29). Along with the primary objective criterion of mortality, there are numerous secondary outcomes such as complication rates, length of stay, and associated injuries. The vast majority of authors see the advantages of early stabilization of fractures; however, debate remains regarding the procedure and the timing. In the only prospective study to date, a high number of pulmonary complications were seen in the group with multiple intramedullary nails (8.2 versus 62.5 %) [209] . As a consequence, the author recommends a staged treatment strategy. In other studies with retrospective data, authors found no increased risk for pulmonary complications such as (fat) pulmonary emboli after multiple intramedullary nails. On the other hand, they found shorter rehabilitation times and lower complication rates in operatively stabilized (pediatric) patients, and advocate primary definitive stabilization. In summary, early definitive operative stabilization is increasingly favored in the literature; however, the type and timing for this stabilization remain topics of debate. Thus, analogous to treatment of isolated injuries of the lower extremities (see above), it is best to take an approach adapted to the risk profile [32, 39, 181] . In this way, the majority of severely injured patients who are hemodynamically stable within 24 hours can then be safely treated primarily with (multiple) intramedullary nails.

The following cites studies including both monotrauma and polytrauma patients with proximal femur fractures [36, 105, 106] . Proximal femur fractures are classified according to location as intracapsular, extracapsular (trochanteric), and subtrochanteric fractures. Femoral head fractures (Pipkin fractures) are rare and often associated with hip dislocation and/or acetabular fractures. Operative treatment ranges from the removal of small osteochondral fragments to re-fixation up to femoral head reconstruction. Femoral neck fractures are common among the elderly after relatively trivial trauma; however, in younger patients they are mostly caused by high velocity trauma, often associated with multiple additional injuries. As a femoral head preserving procedure, (cannulated) screw fixation is favored [10, 94, 133, 134, 136, 137] . Prosthetic replacement is reported as equivalent [87, 133, 134, 136, 142, 156, 191] . While the meta-analyses of Bhandari et al. [11] and Parker et al. [135, 138, 139] found much higher revision rates after fixation for isolated femoral neck fractures, the group with joint replacement had increased infection rates, blood loss, operative time, and tendency for mortality [11] . To date, there has been no evidence that a bipolar prosthesis is superior to total joint replacement in polytrauma patients [33, 38, 135, 138, 139] . For extracapsular fractures, treatment can be performed with extramedullary fixed plate sliding screw fixation (dynamic hip screw, Medoff sliding plate, etc.) or intramedullary procedures (proximal femoral nail, gamma nail, etc.) [7, 27, 28, 37, 53, 64, 72, 73, 91, 102-104 [, 124, 132-136, 138, 139, 141, 147, 197] . Generally, surgical management of proximal femur fractures is considered standard treatment [7, 23, 43, 55, 62, 100, 135, [138] [139] [140] 202] . There is no evidence from randomized studies regarding the timing of fracture management; and observational studies have reached various conclusions [22, 45, 70, 140, 194] . Early operative management (within 24-36 hours) after physiological stabilization is recommended for most patients. Unnecessary delays of surgery can increase complication rates (decubiti, pneumonia [26, 31, 97, 201] . The central argument of proponents is the ability for early weight-bearing. Nevertheless, in a retrospective study of 255 patients with femur fractures, Neudeck et al. [121] reported that only 29 % of these patients, considering injury severity, pattern of injury, and clinical course, were able to benefit from early weight-bearing after primary intramedullary nailing. Thus, the choice of primary operative approach (nailing versus plate fixation) in polytrauma patients remains a matter of debate for a few authors [5, 16, 18, 84, 92, 128, 163, 170, 176] . Bone et al. [16] found that the incidence of pulmonary complications is not dependent on the type of stabilization (nail/plate), but solely on the lung injury. In a retrospective study of 217 patients with reamed femoral nail and 206 patients with plate fixation, Bosse et al. [18] also found no difference in the incidence of respiratory failure (ARDS) in multiply injured patients with and without chest trauma. In a retrospective study of primary plate fixation, Aufmkolk et al. [5] reported no increased mortality and morbidity of patients with and without chest trauma (AIS Thorax C 3). In support of this, several animal models, including one by Wozasek et al. [203] , found no evidence of a significant pulmonary-hemodynamic effect between medullary nailing and plate osteosynthesis. There is no dispute that fat embolism occurs as a result of increased intramedullary pressure during nailing and has been proven in many animal studies especially with echocardiography [148] . Whether this is clinically relevant remains unclear and thus, also the question of whether unreamed intramedullary nails should be favored. Correspondingly, several prospective randomized studies comparing reamed and un-reamed medullary nailing found no differences in the ARDS rate, pulmonary complications, or survival [4, 34] . Primary intramedullary nails are considered contraindicated in hemodynamically stable patients with open grade III femur fractures and vascular involvement [52, 121, 184] . In these cases, alternative procedures such as external fixators are applied [168] . Femoral shaft fractures are characterized by good callus formation and low risk of complications [25] . Ten to twenty percent of femoral shaft fractures are associated with ligamentous injuries in the knee joint. Potential complications are: bleeding, infection, wound healing disturbances, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, malunion, rotational deformity, limited range of motion, thrombosis, embolism.",

The following cites studies including both monotrauma and polytrauma patients with ankle fractures. Operative treatment overall and the type of internal fixation for fibula fractures depend on the overall pattern of injury in the patient with multiple injuries. Some authors prefer external fixation when the ISS [ 25 or 29 points and/or there is chest trauma of AIS [ 3 [120, 3, 167] . In addition, the fracture type determines the choice of fixation materials. Proximal Fibula: In Maisonneuve injuries, the distal fibula should be operatively fixed to the tibia in the upper ankle [47] . Two syndesmosis screws should be inserted. Because they are tricortical, they offer 5-fold greater tear and rotational strength than syndesmosis suture alone [56, 206] . Fibula Shaft: High fibular fractures such as those after a pronation-eversion injury Lauge Hansen type III or IV should be treated operatively (plate fixation). The complex disruption mechanism may have resulted as well in other bony (medial malleolar) and ligamentous (syndesmosis, medial/lateral capsular ligament) injuries [161] . Distal Fibula: Isolated malleolar fractures must be distinguished as ''stable'' and ''unstable'' fractures. Stable fractures are those at the level of the syndesmosis (Weber B1) and supination-eversion fractures SE type II according to Luage Hansen [24, 44, 160, 207] . A lateral malleolar fracture is considered stable when there is no fibular shortening, displacement is not[2 mm, there is no angular deformity, and the posterior syndesmosis is intact [44, 160] . Stable lateral malleolar fractures can be treated conservatively, e.g. in a plaster cast or a synthetic orthotic. Other fractures must be treated operatively. The type of internal fixation depends on the accompanying soft-tissue injury (contusion, swelling, compartment syndrome) [150] . In higher grade soft-tissue injuries or complex fracture types (e.g., fracture-dislocations), the initial goal is external fixation regardless of the extent of remaining injuries, to prevent neurovascular damage [21] . In cases of stable lateral malleolar fractures or lateral malleolar fractures that have been operatively stabilized, significant improvements of ankle mobility and shorter rehabilitation times have been achieved with a follow up treatment strategy including early functional therapy and weight-bearing [152] .

There is wide variation among worldwide collectives regarding the severity, mechanism of injury, localization of vascular injury (and other injuries), and the quality of preoperative evaluation and management [151, 179, 185, 189, 193] . The morphological damage to the vessels depending on the mechanism of injury is specifically reported regarding its importance for the type of management [195] . Treatment recommendations given here are based primarily on the experience and recommendations of experts who have published their results and conclusions for individual patient collectives. Only one publication was based on a controlled, randomized study [196] . However, the published recommendations from various areas of trauma and vascular surgery enable only limited conclusions regarding the treatment for severe injuries of the lower extremity with vascular involvement in multiply injured patients. Thus, ultimately, an individual decision must be made for each individual patient. Provided the overall injury severity of the patient allows, operative treatment of vascular injuries of the lower extremity should be performed as soon as possible also in polytrauma patients, i.e. directly after treatment of lifethreatening injuries. There is no consensus in the literature whether the greatest advantage is offered by fracture stabilization prior to vascular reconstruction or vice versa. Interim solutions (such as primary shunt placement to stabilize perfusion, fracture stabilization, and later definitive vascular reconstruction, or providing a damage control framework until physiological recompensation after severe trauma) are also under discussion [82, 110, 119, 122, 125, 129, 146, 183] . In cases of complex trauma when there is a high probability of vascular injury, primary vascular revision should be performed, with immediate vascular reconstruction if needed [196] . The resources, operative principles, and operative techniques correspond to those for management of non-trauma-induced arterial and venous reconstructions and sometimes extend beyond the indication spectrum. Arterial injuries of the iliac and femoral vessel tracts should be reconstructed and are usually technically easily accessible. An isolated crural artery injury can be ligated if there is confirmation that the major distal arteries are patent. When there are injuries affecting at least two vessels, there is almost always a critical perfusion disorder that requires primary revascularization. The combination with venous injuries increases the rate of amputation, which is why venous reconstruction should be widely performed when treating combination injuries [51, 179, 185] . Arterial injuries of the lower extremity should be treated with (in descending order) direct suture, insertion of a continuitypreserving anastomosis, patch angioplasty (autologous, synthetic), or bypass reconstruction (autologous, synthetic, composite) [46, 193] . Venous injuries of the lower extremities should be treated with (in descending order) patch graft, autologous vein interposition graft, PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) interposition graft, or primary ligature [1, 113, 131, 143, 144, 158, 186] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 342, "end": 347, "text": "[151,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 348, "end": 352, "text": "179,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1609"}, {"start": 353, "end": 357, "text": "185,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1615"}, {"start": 358, "end": 362, "text": "189,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1619"}, {"start": 363, "end": 367, "text": "193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1623"}, {"start": 524, "end": 529, "text": "[195]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1625"}, {"start": 788, "end": 793, "text": "[196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1626"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1802, "text": "[82,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1807, "text": "110,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1812, "text": "119,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1813, "end": 1817, "text": "122,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1818, "end": 1822, "text": "125,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1827, "text": "129,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1832, "text": "146,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1837, "text": "183]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1613"}, {"start": 2016, "end": 2021, "text": "[196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1626"}, {"start": 2794, "end": 2798, "text": "[51,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2799, "end": 2803, "text": "179,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1609"}, {"start": 2804, "end": 2808, "text": "185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1615"}, {"start": 3064, "end": 3068, "text": "[46,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3069, "end": 3073, "text": "193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1623"}, {"start": 3283, "end": 3286, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3287, "end": 3291, "text": "113,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3292, "end": 3296, "text": "131,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3297, "end": 3301, "text": "143,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3302, "end": 3306, "text": "144,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3307, "end": 3311, "text": "158,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3312, "end": 3316, "text": "186]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1616"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "The indication for fasciotomy should be made early; if necessary, it should be carried out before the vascular reconstruction [50, 179] .

Because of the destructive consequences occurring with a few hours, they require rapid decompression (fasciotomy) during fracture stabilization. Van den Brand et al. [20] even support prophylactic versus therapeutic fasciotomy. Early diagnosis of compartment syndrome is crucial, since irreversible damage of muscle and nerves results within eight hours [199] . The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical criteria [74] . Normal coloration and temperature of the skin as well as the presence of distal pulses [65, 74, 117, 199] do not rule out compartment syndrome. The cardinal symptoms of pain and pain provoked by muscle extension and sensory tests are generally of no use in unconscious or sedated polytrauma patients. Therefore, in unconscious patients, Rowland et al. [165] suggest that definitive diagnosis should be made with a pressure-measurement device. Compartment pressures over 30 mmHg or, in cases of hypotension, exceeding the difference BP(diastolic) -30 mmHg, are considered threshold values and are indications for fasciotomy in an unconscious patient [65, 90, 112, 117, 199] . Once the diagnosis of compartment syndrome is made, immediate fasciotomy (emergency procedure) is indicated [65, 74, 117, 199] . All four muscle compartments of the lower leg should be released. The prognosis depends on the overall injury pattern and has the most favorable prognosis in cases of isolated compartment syndrome without fracture. In cases of concomitant fracture, stable bony fixation should be performed with the fasciotomy. Preferred means of stable fixation is intramedullary nailing [49, 192] over other procedures because it leads to less soft-tissue irritation and avoids the need for pin transfixation of the tissues. A meta-analysis by Bhandari et al. [13] evaluated reamed versus un-reamed nails for the relative risk of compartment syndrome. Although the difference was not significant (relative risk 0.45; 95% CI: 0.13-1.56), the authors concluded that reaming the intramedullary nail appears to decrease the risk for compartment syndrome.

The local and overall condition of the patient plays a decisive role.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "Critical injuries of the lower extremities can present a complex problem in the treatment of patients with multiple injuries. Often the critical decision between amputation and limb preservation must be made. The literature has shown that the loss of neurological function is correlated with delayed amputation and increased morbidity and mortality [2] . Early amputation should be considered if there is loss of function and sensation of the foot/extremity. Conversely, when function and sensation of the foot/extremity remain intact, the goal should be preservation [2] . Thus, amputation should be standard for all patients such as those with a type IIIc fracture and completely severed sciatic or tibial nerve. No study has shown benefits for extremity salvage versus amputation when there is significant nerve separation [15, 111, 166] . Vascular integrity increases the probability for limb salvage [164] . Perfusion disorders should be remedied as quickly as possible. Ischemia lasting[6 hours is correlated with irreversible nerve injury and loss of function [96, 180] . For practical reasons, necrotic (parts of the) extremities should be amputated. Delayed amputation leads to significant increases in sepsis, immobility, number of required operative procedures, mortality, and costs [15, 111, 166] . Many reports have been published regarding the objective criteria to decide between amputation and limb salvage [58, 76, 86, 98] . However, to date none of these studies has been able to define guaranteed prediction instruments for this decision. Scoring systems (e.g. predictive salvage index, mangled extremity severity score MESS, limb salvage score or nerve injury, ischemia, soft-tissue injury, skeletal injury, shock and age of patient NISSSA scoring index) can serve as supplements to clinical assessment. Thus, it is absolutely necessary that an individual decision be made for each patient and each injury. The decision to amputate or to salvage an extremity should never be made purely based on the basis of a protocol or algorithm [14] . In summary, primary and secondary amputation rates for injuries of the lower extremity (without being predictable, e.g. through scoring systems) depend on the number and location of concomitant arterial and venous injuries, injured nerves, overall severity of injuries, and the magnitude of accompanying soft-tissue damage [6, 50, 51, 83, 88, 109, 114, 125, 154, 173, 174, 177, 179, 185, 193] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 352, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 568, "end": 571, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 826, "end": 830, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 831, "end": 835, "text": "111,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 836, "end": 840, "text": "166]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 905, "end": 910, "text": "[164]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1067, "end": 1071, "text": "[96,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1076, "text": "180]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1610"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1298, "text": "[15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1303, "text": "111,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1308, "text": "166]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1423, "end": 1427, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1431, "text": "76,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1435, "text": "86,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1439, "text": "98]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2053, "end": 2057, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2386, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2387, "end": 2390, "text": "50,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2394, "text": "51,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2398, "text": "83,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2402, "text": "88,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2403, "end": 2407, "text": "109,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2408, "end": 2412, "text": "114,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2413, "end": 2417, "text": "125,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2422, "text": "154,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2423, "end": 2427, "text": "173,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2432, "text": "174,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2433, "end": 2437, "text": "177,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1607"}, {"start": 2438, "end": 2442, "text": "179,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1609"}, {"start": 2443, "end": 2447, "text": "185,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1615"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2452, "text": "193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1623"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "Often, despite a high level of personnel and material resources devoted to management of patients with multiple injuries, there are residual complaints and restricted function in the foot.

Secondary split thickness skin grafts are suitable for superficial defects of non-weight-bearing areas. These require a clean (non-sterile) wound base without exposed bone, cartilage, or tendons. In children, the demands for the wound base are much less [2] . There are still unresolved problems with marginal hyperkeratosis at the borders between graft and local foot skin [13] . In degloving injuries, the superficial layer (approximately 0.3 mm) of hypoperfused and potentially avital abraded skin can be detached with the dermatome and used for coverage of neighboring areas with vital wound base (split thickness skin excision) [100] .

The choice of flap here depends on the defect size and the pattern of blood supply and takes into account the functional-anatomical foot zone divisions and the like with like principle [2, 32, 51] . Due to their limited range of use, local pedicled flaps are suitable for covering smaller lateral, medial, or plantar defects [24] . Free flaps with microvascular anastomosis require an intact point of attachment, and in addition to the technical feasibility, consideration must be given to the types of shoes worn and cosmetic aspects [76] . Preoperative angiography (and phlebography if necessary) should be routinely carried out [42] . More extensive defects on the flat dorsum of the foot do well with free fasciocutaneous flaps, while deep, contaminated defect cavities need to be filled with splitthickness muscle flaps (e.g., latissimus dorsi). The latter are less bulky than myocutaneous flaps [49] . When the main vessels are insufficient, a salvage procedure can be performed with a pedicle-rotated sural flap [7, 14, 45] . Even when there is successful limb preservation, there are often considerable functional deficits, particularly after Pilon, talus, and calcaneus fractures [31, 78, 84] . This is explained partially by arthrogenic and tendogenic fibrosis with corresponding mobility deficits after the longer immobilization required. In grade II and III open lower leg fractures, early defect coverage with free flaps has proven superior to delayed coverage [12, 18, 23] . Experience with the foot is less due to smaller patient numbers. In initial series, patients with larger, contaminated defects in open foot trauma reached good functional outcomes with early flap coverage within 24-120 hours and primary stable bony fixation [14, 56, 93] [62] [54 ] .

Thus, one point is awarded for each injured foot region and one point for the grade of soft-tissue damage according to Tscherne and Oestern [91] ; complex foot trauma is defined by a score of five or more points. The absolute score value also enables a prognostic statement [101] . The criteria for amputation when complex foot trauma is present in multiply injured patients are not well defined in relation to overall injury severity. Tscherne [91] recommends primary amputation by a PTS score (Hannover Polytrauma Key [75] ) of 3-4, and a case-by-case decision with a PTS of 2. Additional help for the decision is offered by the validated Hannover fracture scale (HFS [92] ), MESS (Mangled Extremity Severity Score [36] ), NISSSA score (Nerve injury, Ischemia, Soft tissue injury, Skeletal injury, Shock and Age of patient [50] ), Predictive Salvage Index (PSI) [34] , and Limb Salvage Index (LSI) [77] . In a prospective multicenter study of 601 patients with complex injuries of the lower extremity (Lower Extremity Assessment Project, LEAP), all scores (HFS, MESS, NISSSA, PSI, LSI) achieved high specificity but low to moderate sensitivity [8] . This means that a low score can reliably predict limb preservation, but a higher score is not predictive for amputation. Thus, the authors caution against non-critical application of these scores when deciding in favor of amputation [8] . Also, such scores cannot replace the individual considerations of the overall polytrauma course as well as the specific local pattern of foot injury [103, 104] . In addition to general criteria such as age, concomitant medical problems, and accompanying injuries, the following points regarding the foot are important for the decision to amputate. Large portions of the foot sole, with its unique chambered profile, cannot be replaced by equivalent tissue and loss of these is potentially more serious than defects on the dorsum of the foot. Vascular injuries endanger the viability of distal foot sections and severely impair the recovery of foot function [9, 27, 82, 104] . The loss of the protective sensitivity of the foot sole from a traumatic tibial nerve lesion entails greater potential for late soft-tissue related complications even though sensation can be restored within two years for about half of the cases of blunt tibial nerve injury [10] . Severe comminution of the bony framework and joint destruction that requires primary arthrodesis to support internal fixation will potentially lead to a rigid foot with non-physiological pressure distribution on the foot sole, which has often already been compromised by the trauma itself. Traumatic loss of the talus or its joint surfaces with the necessary tibio-talar, tibio-talo-calcaneal, or pan-talar arthrodeses leads to a rigid foot with considerable functional impairment even when there is unproblematic bone and wound healing [25, 78, 81] . In all of these cases, the indication for amputation should be considered early even if there are no life-threatening concomitant injuries [27, 57, 78, 83] . In these cases, the Pirogoff amputation enables the original sole of the foot to bear weight; it is also suitable in cases of critical perfusion conditions [101] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 180, "end": 185, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 328, "end": 332, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 462, "end": 467, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 633, "end": 637, "text": "[91]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 708, "end": 712, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 858, "end": 862, "text": "[92]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 905, "end": 909, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1017, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1056, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1092, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1334, "end": 1337, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1576, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1733, "text": "[103,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1738, "text": "104]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2236, "end": 2239, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2240, "end": 2243, "text": "27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2247, "text": "82,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2252, "text": "104]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2533, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3073, "end": 3077, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3078, "end": 3081, "text": "78,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3085, "text": "81]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3227, "end": 3231, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3232, "end": 3235, "text": "57,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3236, "end": 3239, "text": "78,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3240, "end": 3243, "text": "83]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3402, "end": 3407, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "In the LEAP Study at eight North American Level I trauma centers, the most important criteria for amputation in severe high-energy injuries of the lower leg and foot were: severe muscular injury (OR 8.74), severe venous injury (OR 5.72), lack of plantar sensation (OR 5.26), open foot fracture (OR 3.12), and absent foot pulses (OR 2.02). Patient-related factors that influenced the decision in favor of amputation were hemorrhagic shock and concomitant diseases; in this series, the overall injury severity (ISS) had no significant influence [88] . In the LEAP study subgroup analysis of 174 severe open foot injuries, there were significantly worse SIP values after limb preservation versus lower leg amputation when flap coverage and/or ankle arthrodesis were necessary [21] . In an analysis of 50 complex foot injuries, Kinner et al. (2011) reported a significant correlation between amputation and ISS [ 16 as well as the primary soft tissue damage [39] . In contrast to the vascular surgery principle of waiting for demarcation of hypoperfused limb areas, in acute trauma, an early decision regarding the need for eventual amputation is advisable to enable early definitive soft-tissue closure [101, 102] . In principle, tourniquets should be avoided during surgery so that the viability of bones and musculature can be accurately assessed [57, 74] . Experience with replantation at the foot is disproportionately less than that at the hand and are limited to case reports and small case series [4, 6, 19, 38, 99] [61]. The outlook for successful replantation is markedly higher in children than in adults [5, 35] . Essentially, the attempt should only be undertaken when a plantigrade, stable foot with intact sole sensation is a realistic endpoint to be achieved from surgery, without endangering the patient. Important criteria for successful replantation are ischemia time of less than 6 hours and high patient compliance with the prospect of slow, difficult rehabilitation [19] . It is almost impossible to estimate this criterion in multiply injured patients, and a replantation that lasts several hours within the critical ischemia period is generally not indicated due to the overall condition of the patient [82] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 773, "end": 777, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 824, "end": 844, "text": "Kinner et al.

According to case series, the best prognosis for the clinical course is offered by direct repair of all layers within the first 24 hours [12, 13] . The literature states that intrathoracic esophageal injuries should always undergo surgical treatment; there are no studies supporting conservative therapy. In cases where esophageal perforation cannot be directly repaired, partial resections, with interposition grafts if necessary, are recommended [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] ; alternatively, endoluminal glue application with fibrin adhesive can be considered. It should be noted that none of these recommendations stem from clinical studies, rather from case series and individual reports. The procedure should be surgical reconstruction, if necessary with arterial vessel interposition grafts. Various nonlumen-occluding injuries can also be treated conservatively (e.g., dissections). Venous reconstruction must not be performed/is not indicated. Angiography, computed tomography, and duplex/Doppler ultrasound are the investigations of choice for injuries to the neck vessels [21] ; this applies unconditionally to Roon and Christensen zones I and III [23] . In zone II, additional surgical exploration is recommended. Although this remains a subject of debate in the literature, it is undisputed that this procedure enables detection and therapy for 100 % of defects [21, 23] . The largest clinically controlled study was performed by Weaver et al. [24] and concluded that reconstruction of the arterial vessels offers the best outcome in penetrating injuries. Reconstruction of arterial vessels must be performed within a timeframe of 120 minutes [20] . However, injuries that don't occlude the lumen can be successfully treated conservatively with monitoring by duplex ultrasound [24] .

Explanation: A ''second look'' operation is necessary within the damage control sequence for further treatment of organ injuries after packing of the intra-abdominal bleeding and subsequent intensive care stabilization. This surgical intervention can be definitive surgical care or simply exchange of the used packing material and further contamination control. Here, a balance must be maintained between the risk of renewed bleeding and that of possible complications (infection, fistula formation, restricted pulmonary function, abdominal compartment syndrome). The available data from retrospective cohort studies shows that unpacking after 24-36 hours is associated with increased risk of bleeding (pooled relative risk, fixed effects: 3.51, 95% CI: 1.39-8.90) [13, 53]. There is no clear evidence that the risk of septic complications is increased when abdominal dressings are left for 48 hours (pooled relative risk, fixed effects: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.59-1.70) [1, 13, 19, 53]. However, the study by Abikhaled found that when packing materials were left in place for longer than 72 hours there was an associated 7-fold increase in the relative risk for intra-abdominal abscesses (6.77; 95% CI: 0.84-54.25) [1]. These results were confirmed in a current study by Ordonez on 121 patients undergoing DC laparotomy with abdominal packing after penetrating abdominal trauma. When removing abdominal packing within 24 hours, bleeding complications dominate, and after 72 hours, infections are in the foreground[55].

Improvement rates were 8 % and 59 % in the delayed stabilization group, and 25 % and 59 % in the conservative management group. The only randomized controlled study on this topic included 62 patients with isolated cervical spine injury[59]. Although the authors found no difference in neurological results for earlier (\\ 72 hours) versus later ([ 5 days) stabilization, they recommended earlier stabilization. Levi et al. also reported indifferent results regarding earlier (\\ 24 hours) and late ([ 24 hours) stabilization of cervical spine injuries, but also ultimately recommended the earlier procedure[62]. Wagner and Chehrazi also found no correlation between time of surgery and neurological symptoms, and concluded that primary medullary damage determines prognosis[65]. However, other studies related to primary and secondary damage show that secondary damage is not negligible and that patients benefit from avoiding it[3, 70]. McKinley et al. draw a similar conclusion[44]. However, Papadopoulos et al. found better neurological results after earlier surgery[47]. In 1999, Mirza et al. also reported that early stabilization (\\ 72 hours) had more favorable neurological outcomes than later stabilization ([ 72 hours)[46]. All of these are data from studies not exclusively investigating polytrauma patients. In addition to the studies focusing primarily on neurological outcomes, there are a number of studies focusing on non-neurological effects of earlier stabilization. A 2001 study by Croce et al. found evidence that early stabilization (\\3 days) of thoracic spine injuries in polytrauma (average ISS 24) decreased intensive care duration, pneumonia rate, costs, and time of mechanical ventilation compared to later stabilization ([ 3 days)[13].

The indications for surgery include atlanto-occipital dislocation, translational atlanto-axial dislocation, unstable Jefferson fracture, unstable dens fracture (especially type II), Hangman's fracture (pars interarticularis fracture C2 and disc injury C2/C3), C3-C7 fractures (A3, B, and C types) also in terms of dislocation, and T1 to L5 fractures (A3, B, and C types) also in terms of dislocation. According to prevailing opinion, there is also an absolute indication for surgery when there is an open spine injury [19, 51] . Also useful in establishing indications for primary management of spine injuries in polytrauma is to classify according to a) complex spine injuries with injury to essential neural pathways and organs such as spinal cord, lungs, large vessels and abdominal organs, b) unstable spine injuries (types A3, B, and C), in whom functional management can lead to severe deformity and neurologic damage, and c) stable spine injuries according to . If complex or unstable spine injury is present, operative stabilization should be sought as soon as possible-on the day of the injury if none of the contraindications listed below is present [8] .According to , a complex spinal injury is a multi-level spinal injury or one accompanied by concomitant intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal injury or by polytrauma. That polytrauma ''creates'' a complex injury is substantiated by, among others, the studies of Hebert and Burnham [26] , who determined that hospital stays are longer and the number of surgeries increased in these patients, and that the combination of spine injury with multiple trauma is associated with higher morbidity and mortality as well as increased degree of disability. Nevertheless, according to a North American survey by Tator et al. 1999 , one third of spine injuries with neurologic damage were still treated conservatively and only 60 % of operations were performed before the 5th day, with 40 % afterwards [60] . The goal of primary operative management in unstable spinal injuries with confirmed or assumed neurologic deficits or with deformity is first, early spinal decompression while avoiding secondary neurologic damage and second, to achieve stability for positioning maneuvers during intensive care [36] .

As a rule, corpectomy is the procedure of choice, with removal of the disc, replacement with iliac crest bone graft or a cage if necessary, and stabilization with a plate, possibly with a fixed-angle [14] . Because of the bridging effect during fixation, the use of chips and locking plates has not yielded better healing [53] .In polytrauma patients, ventral management of unstable cervical spine fractures is preferable to dorsal stabilization procedures, particularly on the day of trauma [37] . According to Brodke et al. [10] , there are no significant differences regarding bony consolidation, reduction success, neurological symptoms, or long-term complaints in ventral versus dorsal approaches to the C-spine; however, the latter is much more complex and time-consuming, which is why it should not be recommended in patients with multiple injuries. If there is an unstable dens fracture, ventral screw placement is generally indicated. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, a Magerl screw is preferable due to the lower rate of screw displacement. In cases of a Jefferson fracture, dorsal screws or occipitocervical fusion might be indicated.

There is often risk of suffocation from foreign bodies (e.g., dental prostheses, tooth and bone fragments, blood clots, mucus, vomit). This risk should be eliminated by manually clearing the oral cavity and the pharynx as well as suctioning the deeper airways [2] . An unstable mandible as a result of comminution or dispersal of the middle fragment can cause the tongue to fall back and displace the airway. This dangerous situation can be remedied through reduction and stabilization of the mandible with wire ligatures attached to available teeth [2] . If the airways in the head and neck area are obstructed by heavy bleeding, tongue swelling, and displacement, then depending on the urgency and feasibility, intubation, tracheotomy, or crichothyroidotomy (coniotomy) are necessary [3, 28] .If the larger vessels are involved (generally the origin of the external carotid artery), surgical hemostasis is necessary. Open surgical hemostasis with vascular ligation, bipolar electrocoagulation, or embolization through angiography is recommended [16, 18, 28] . The exact source of bleeding should be localized for effective hemostasis [38] . Epistaxis is one of the most common types of bleeding. Most bleeding can be stopped through primary compression with tamponade placement [26, 40] . When there is persistent nasopharyngeal bleeding, it is necessary to place Bellocq packing or a balloon catheter [15] . When there is bleeding in the maxillofacial area, particularly from the maxillary artery, an attempt can be made to arrest the bleeding by compressing the maxilla dorsocranially against the base of the skull (e.g., spatula head bandage, dental impression tray with extra-oral brace) [2] . In the case of sagittal maxillary fractures, compression might be necessary, e.g. by a transverse wire suture from the molars on one side to those on the contralateral side [2, 37] .

The most unfavorable prognosis is for avulsed teeth that have been preserved in dry condition for several hours, although there have been individual reports of successful replantations in such cases.

Particular value is placed on the restoration of occlusion, articulation, joint function, and aesthetics, as well as the function of motor and/or sensory nerves. Treatment strategy, operative technique, and procedure are comparable in isolated and combination injuries of the mandible and/or midface. Ideally, early definitive primary treatment of maxillofacial and mandible fractures can be performed [7, 36] . In maxillofacial fractures, early treatment with anatomical reduction and fixation minimizes the development of edema and enables better re-contouring of the facial soft tissues [12, 23, 34] . However, the timing of the procedure is very vaguely reported, with ''immediately'' or ''within the first few days.'' Bos et al. [4] recommend surgical treatment of maxillofacial fractures with open reduction and internal fixation within 48-72 hours to achieve good aesthetic and functional results and to avoid the need for secondary corrections. In children with maxillofacial fractures, better reduction of the bony fragments and more rapid healing and thus, also better aesthetic results were observed when surgery was performed within a week of trauma [19] . Regarding concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) gives valuable information regarding the prognosis of the injured patient. However, this does not mean that patients with low GCS must be automatically excluded from the management of craniofacial fractures. Manson [23] reported that patients with head injuries can undergo surgery without increased complication rates, provided that intracranial pressure is kept below 25 mmHg during the procedure. In a retrospective study of 49 patients with mandibular and/or maxillofacial fractures and concomitant traumatic brain injury, Derdyn et al. [8] observed that patients with intracranial pressure below 15 mmHg after early surgical management (0-3 days after trauma) had comparable survival rates to patients undergoing medium-term (4-7 days after trauma) and later ([ 7 days) procedures. Postoperative complications were comparable between the patient cohorts undergoing early, medium-term, and late surgery. In contrast, craniofaciallyinjured patients with low GCS, intracranial bleeding, and shifts in median brain structures after lateral and multisystem trauma had significantly worse prognoses. Due to improvements in functional and aesthetic outcomes through the use of mini-and microplates and through less invasive surgical techniques [14] , there is increasing debate regarding early management within 24-72 hours. If higher priority is given to the overall condition or other injuries, then definitive management of craniofacial injuries can be postponed to 7-10 days after trauma, with primary management limited to soft tissue injuries and temporary stabilization (e.g., with splint bandaging, wire ligatures, splints) of fractures [7] . Ideally, soft-tissue injury care and temporary stabilization can be performed in the Emergency Department [20] .In a retrospective study of comparable groups with a total of 82 multiply injured patients with mandibular and/or maxillofacial fractures, Weider et al. [47] found that delayed management (C 48 hours) did not extend intensive care or hospital admission times. The infection rate was negligible and the complication rate comparable to patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours. Schettler [35] reported no disadvantages when definitive management of maxillofacial fractures occurred within 14 days. Neither infections nor residual eye motility disorders were increased compared to immediate treatment. On the other hand, once the initially severe edema subsided, the complicated reduction of even the smallest bone fragments was much easier to perform. He considers the time between the 5th and 10th day post-trauma as the most favorable period to perform definitive management. K\u00fchne et al. [20] retrospectively analyzed 78 trauma patients with mandibular and/or maxillofacial fractures who underwent surgery. There was a practically identical rate of postoperative complications in the patients treated with early primary (within 72 hours) or delayed (after 72 hours) surgery. The group of patients undergoing delayed surgery had markedly higher overall injury severity than those undergoing early primary management. Exceptions for delayed management are incessant bleeding from fractures requiring immediate reduction and internal fixation as well as intraorbital or intracranial injuries of the optic nerve requiring therapeutic intervention within a few hours [7] . Retrobulbar hematomas, elevated eye pressure, or direct optic nerve compression with visual impairment can require immediate administration of a cortisone", "cite_spans": [{"start": 455, "end": 458, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 459, "end": 462, "text": "36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 643, "end": 647, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 648, "end": 651, "text": "23,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 652, "end": 655, "text": "34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 787, "end": 790, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1219, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1522, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1847, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2545, "end": 2549, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2946, "end": 2949, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3058, "end": 3062, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3217, "end": 3221, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3453, "end": 3457, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3956, "end": 3960, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4630, "end": 4633, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanation:"}, {"text": "Key recommendations:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Neck"}, {"text": "GoR A Provided that intubation or tracheotomy has not yet been performed, clinical findings relating to the airways must be observed and evaluated prior to anesthetic induction for intubation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Recommendation 2011"}, {"text": "GoR A Intubation tools and a crichothyrotomy (coniotomy) set must be kept available for immediate use.
