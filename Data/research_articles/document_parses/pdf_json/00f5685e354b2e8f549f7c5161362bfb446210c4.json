In case of positive results, either a follow-up of patient in order to confirm results by seroconversion or a NAT might be necessary. However, comparing different blood specimens significantly different results were obtained either on quantitative or qualitative evaluation. Hence, there is an urgent need for quality standards to be implemented, harmonization of tests allowing to compare test results and to guide further decisions.
