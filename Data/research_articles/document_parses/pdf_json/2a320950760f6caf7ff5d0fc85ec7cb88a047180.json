This practice arose from an earler proposal [5] to use the name 'retinoids' collectively for both natural forms and synthetic analogs of vitamin A that are capable of preventing the development of cancer. General usage of this term is, however, misleading for two reasons. Firstly, the customary practice gives the name 'retinoids', which has an agreed definition based on chemical structure [3] , to a class of compounds defined by their biological activity. Secondly, many synthetic members of this class of compounds, the so-called 'arotinoids' [9] or 'retinoidal benzoic acid derivatives' [10] as well as others, are not chemically retinoids. They contain, e.g., aromatic rings replacing either the basic -ionone type ring structure or unsaturated bonds of the tetraene side chain of tire retinoid skeleton (Formula II). We now suggest that the compounds that control epithelial differentiation and prevent metaplasia, without processing the full range of activities of vitamin A, should be termed 'retinoate analogs'. Although they are usually called 'retinoids', we discourage their designation by a term that has a defined, but different, meaning.",

Allergen nomenclature. The World Health Organization/ International Union of Immunological Societies (WHO/IUIS) published a revised nomenclature for protein allergens in 1994 (see above, document No. 11 of the WHO/IUIS list). These recommendations extended the original taxonomic source-based nomenclature to permit the designation of allergen genes; the proposals have been fully implemented in the Swiss-Prot database. Readers are encouraged to submit information on new protein allergens to the IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee for the assignment of an approved name.
