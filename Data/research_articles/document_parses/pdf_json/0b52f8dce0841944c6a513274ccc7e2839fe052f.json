The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is one of the greatest destinations of religious congregations of Muslims. One of the largest religious gatherings is the Hajj that is anticipated to produce serious challenges of mass level exposures and spread to every corner of the world. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah (KSA), must regularly analyze the prevailing situation of COVID-19, and involve the religious scholars to make appropriate decisions about Hajj 2020. Although the Saudi government has been continuously taking all possible measures to contain the pandemic, people's cooperation is crucial in the fight against COVID-19. \u00aa 2020 Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control.

            "text": "Hajj is an annual evangelistic ritual accompanied by over two million Muslims originating from all across the globe and all destined to the Holy City of Mecca, KSA. According to the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, KSA, the most recent number of Hajj pilgrims have enrolled equivalent to 7, 457, 663 pilgrims during 2019. During the past five years, a growth of over 1.7 million pilgrims has been recorded, which is overwhelming. The inter-annual comparisons based on Hajj data collected from the preceding five years ( Fig. 1) suggests that more Muslims are expected to participate in the 2020 Hajj congregations [1]. The 2020 Hajj rituals will commence from the end of July and continue until early August. Nonetheless, the holy month of fasting i.e., Ramadhan, is forthcoming in a month from now, which also attracts an approximately similar number of Umrah pilgrims (although it is open year-round except during the Hajj).",

The first case of COVID-19 detected in a Saudi national who traveled from Iran to the Kingdom via Bahrain. Since then, COVID-19 cases have been increasing continuously and reached to 2795 cases as of 7 April 2020 [2]. It exposed a rapid local transmission of COVID-19 inside the kingdom as well. Even though stringent measures have been taken by the government to mitigate the spread of this deadly virus, infection is expanding at an alarming state. In this backdrop, the Saudi government needs to take further actions to prevent this rapid spread across the country.",

It warrants other countries with sizeable Muslim masses to take immediate preventive measures to counteract the COVID-19 spread. The majority of pilgrims are of older ages, so they are highly prone to a greater risk of mortality. So all the stakeholders need to coordinate and take rigorous measures to mitigate its spread and associated risks to global human populations.",

RMS is very crucial in the context of religious and emotional attachments of the masses, which require sensitive administration and decision-making. Therefore, any choices opted in this regard will influence the masses and their religious sentiments around the globe. To cope with it efficiently now is the time to look into plausible solutions to evade the impending outbreaks culminating into adverse circumstances, which may strike everywhere [8] . We urge the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, and with the assistance of leading religious scholars, should investigate the potential issues related to Hajj and propose feasible solutions to contain the prevailing situation. The Saudi government should seriously consider the option of a complete lockdown in the country until the pandemic is under control. However, public support is crucial to surmount this crisis; hence, the government may focus on awareness drive among people, including social media. Let us hope that appropriate measures contribute to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the kingdom; otherwise, it may affect the Hajj and pilgrims in 2020.",
