            "text": "SN is an 84-year-old African-American male who developed renal failure after undergoing a triple-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) following a myocardial infarction in 2004. He has a history of hypertension and has been stable on hemodialysis via an AV fistula. He has excellent exercise tolerance, a normal ejection fraction on cardiac catheterization, and was asymptomatic with regard to his coronary artery disease. He is fully functional and living independently since he retired from his job as a bus operator. He was placed on the waiting list for renal transplant in 2007. He received a zero mismatch offer from a 75-year-old deceased donor in August 2008. The donor was a 125 lb woman with no significant medical history who died from a cerebrovascular attack (CVA). Her serum creatinine was 0.7 mg/dL and postprocurement biopsy revealed minimal glomerulosclerosis. Both kidneys were pumped and then implanted ipsilaterally in a 4\u00bd-h operation. He exhibited good immediate function and mild troponin elevation, but no other complications. He received induction therapy with three doses of thymoglobulin (1.5 mg/kg/dose), Prograf, and steroids. He was discharged to home 5 days later with a creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL. No hospital readmissions occurred, and 1 year following transplantation, his creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL. He is currently being maintained on Prograf 2 mg twice daily and prednisone 5 mg daily. He remains quite active working as a producer for a local radio station, and he travels extensively visiting family. loss and death, and the degree and type of immunosuppressive therapy. This discussion focuses primarily on deceaseddonor organ transplants into the elderly, since fewer live-donor transplants are performed in the aged (670 transplants in 2008) . The kidney being the most frequently transplanted solid organ offers the most data in older patients and is therefore a primary focus of this chapter. No consensus exists as to what age defines \"elderly\" or \"geriatric\" within the transplant literature, and therefore, no attempt is made to offer such a definition; rather, the studies and data are examined with regard to the issues to be examined and the principles to be applied to older transplant candidates.",

The U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) collects and provides national demographic information about patients with kidney disease treated with either dialysis or transplantation. The average age of the dialysis patient continues to increase each year, with nearly half of patients undergoing regular dialysis now over 65 years of age, and the mean age of those beginning treatment is now greater than 60 years [2]. There are currently 48,773 patients on the waiting list for a kidney, with 7,800 (16%) over the age of 65.

In one longitudinal study of mortality, investigators evaluated data collected over 6 years on 228,552 patients who were receiving dialysis as treatment for their end-stage renal disease. Of these, 46,164 were deemed healthy enough to be placed on the waiting list for transplantation, and 23,275 received a first deceased-donor kidney transplant. The mortality ratio for the patients on dialysis who were awaiting transplantation was 38-58% lower than that for all patients on dialysis (annual death rates of 6.3 and 16.1 per 100 patient-years, respectively). The long-term mortality rate was 48-82% lower among transplant recipients than patients on the waiting list (annual death rate 3.8 per 100 patient-years). Recipients over the age of 60 demonstrated significant benefit in mortality after transplantation, with annual death rates per 100 patient-years at risk for all patients on dialysis, patients on the waiting list, and transplant recipients being 23.2, 10, and 7.4, respectively. It is estimated that, among those over the age of 60, projected remaining years of life are approximately 6 and 10 years for those who remain on a waiting list or undergo renal transplant, respectively [4] . Multiple studies over the past 10 years have confirmed that patients older than 60 years of age have longer life expectancy with deceased-donor kidney transplantation when compared to patients of the same age group on the waiting list. Post-kidney transplant recipients report a better quality of life, from mental well-being to physical functionality and social functioning. In addition, after adjusting for comorbidities, there is no significant difference in graft failure compared to younger patients [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Older recipients, however, do have a higher risk of cardiovascular events, infection, and malignancy after kidney transplantation compared to younger patients [9] .

Clearly, a younger recipient would more likely experience more years of allograft function with the same kidney. With ever-increasing organ shortages, the ethical dilemma of including age as a potential allocation factor has been raised. The argument pits the increased survival and quality of life for the older transplant recipient against the population gain in allograft survival by transplanting kidneys preferentially into younger recipients. What is the best way to deal with these competing allocation philosophies, namely, giving everyone an equal chance to receive an organ vs. getting the maximum benefit from each organ transplanted? In the U.S., the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) provides regulatory oversight and balances these ethical principles in an effort to achieve socially acceptable allocation policy.",

The current allocation of expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys attempts to do this. These kidneys are procured from donors older than 60 years of age or donors aged 50-59 years with at least two of the following conditions: cerebrovascular accident as cause of death, a history of hypertension, or a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL [11] . While ECD kidneys carry a relative risk of graft failure greater than 1.7 compared to a reference group of donors aged 10-39 years without any of the above three conditions, elderly recipients of ECD kidneys were found to have a survival benefit compared with waiting-list candidates (RR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.65-0.86; p < 0.0001) [8] . The benefits (shortening of waiting time) and risk (impaired long-term graft function) associated with the use of ECD kidneys should be addressed on an individual basis. As with all recipients, elderly patients do best with an ideal donor kidney; however, the ECD policy achieves a compromise that enhances the donor pool and provides good alternative to dialysis.",

Both kidneys from an older donor, which individually would be considered marginal or inadequate for transplantation, are transplanted into a single recipient. This expands the use of kidneys that otherwise would not be used. There is a misconception that dual kidney transplantation involves the transferring of an inferior organ; on the contrary, it is just a different type of organ transplant. For all kidneys being evaluated for donation, the creatinine clearance is calculated. If it is greater than 65 mL/min, each individual kidney may be transplanted into two different recipients. If it is below 40 mL/min both kidneys are usually deemed unsuitable for transplant. The area in between, 40 and 65 mL/min, constitutes the range to use two kidneys together to give recipients the function of one kidney. This allows for the transplantation of as much kidney function as, if not more than, a standard single transplant from a nonexpanded criteria donor. With careful selection, the amount of kidney function that is being transplanted with dual kidney is comparable to a single kidney transplant [12] .",

            "text": "Regardless of the age of the recipient, a thorough medical, surgical, and psychosocial history needs to be obtained, along with a detailed physical examination. Careful examination of the abdomen for previous operations is important, as is the presence or absence of peripheral arterial pulses. Initial laboratory testing includes blood type, HLA typing and a panel reactive antibody assay to detect for previous sensitization, complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, albumin, liver function tests, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. Serologic studies for cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are routine. One element of the evaluation process includes baseline age-appropriate screening tests. It is also important and appropriate to maintain a higher index of suspicion for malignancy in patients of this age group. In women, this consists of gynecologic examination and Papanicolaou smear, breast examination, and in those over the age of 40 without a family history of breast cancer in the premenopausal years, mammography. In men, testicular examination, prostate examination, and for those over age 50, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay should be performed. All patients over the age of 50 should undergo screening colonoscopy. A screening purified protein derivative (PPD) test may be used depending on the patient population and patient history. Radiologic studies include chest X-ray and electrocardiogram as routine and can include ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen to evaluate anatomy if indicated. Estimation of urine output preoperatively is important because it determines the significance of postoperative urine output and helps determine the need for any urologic evaluation. A history of claudication warrants a workup for peripheral vascular disease and may also point towards a higher chance of ischemic heart disease. The presence of strong femoral and peripheral pulses indicates that the pelvic vessels will likely be adequate for the transplant vascular anastomosis. Assessment of cardiac risk is critical in the evaluation process of elderly patients. Cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias are common in elderly transplant recipients and account for most of the deaths in this population. Blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol control is of particular concern because this patient population frequently have or develop these complications. The prevalence of ischemic heart disease is very high in patients with end-stage renal disease, and almost half of the deaths that occur during the first 30 days posttransplant are due to ischemic heart disease [15] . The current guidelines from the American Society of Transplantation recommend assessing ischemic heart disease risk factors in any patient with a prior history, men over the age of 45 or women over the age of 55 years, cardiac disease in a first-degree relative, current cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, fasting total cholesterol > 200 mg/dL, highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol < 35 mg/dL, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Any patient at high risk, including those with renal disease from diabetes, prior history of ischemic heart disease, or more than two of the above risk factors, should undergo an echocardiogram and cardiac stress test. Angiography with possible revascularization, if indicated, should be performed prior to any transplantation. Asymptomatic patients can also undergo noninvasive tests first that may help determine the risk for posttransplant complications, in the form of chemical stress echocardiography or scintography [15] .",

The concern is that malignancies are common after transplantation, possibly due to immunosuppression favoring the growth of malignant cells and/or viral infection. This part is addressed in a later section on postoperative issues. While it has been reported that patients with ESRD on dialysis have a higher rate of cancer compared to the general population, this relative risk has been shown to be higher in younger patients [18] . Most patients previously treated for cancer benefit from a waiting period prior to renal transplantation to decrease the risk of recurrence. Depending on tumor characteristics, recommendations range from no wait time to 5 years. No waiting time is required for basal cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cancer of the bladder or cervix. A 2-year waiting time is proposed for lymphoma, leukemia, cancers of the prostate, lung, breast (early stage), testicle, thyroid, uterine body, bladder, Wilm's tumor, renal cell carcinoma (<5 cm), or Kaposi's or other sarcoma. Patients with localized, successfully treated carcinoma of the uterine cervix may benefit from waiting 2 years, and in some cases 5 years, prior to transplantation. A 5-year waiting time is recommended for colorectal, invasive breast, and renal cell carcinoma (>5 cm), and malignant melanoma [15, 16, 19] .",

Most infectious episodes occur in the first 6 months posttransplant, likely due to the degree of immunosuppression. The risks of overimmunosuppression and cardiovascular disease are related to the natural effects of aging and factors having to do with end-stage renal disease. Overimmunosuppression will increase infectious complications in all patients, regardless of age. However, the elderly are less immunocompetent, leading them to be more susceptible to infection at lower lev-els of immunosuppressive therapy. Most likely to contribute to this are high-dose corticosteroids and antilymphocyte antibodies at induction. Other causes of death in the elderly recipient include malignancy and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Death due to malignancy has been reported to increase disproportionately with time after transplantation in the elderly recipient [22] . Despite the mortality risks, there is still a better life expectancy and quality of life afforded by kidney transplantation compared to dialysis. With careful selection and responsible follow-up, advanced age alone is not a contraindication to successful transplantation. Age should not be the primary determinant of donor allocation; rather, the focus should be on baseline comorbidity or functional status [10] .",

Some investigators reported that recipient age had an influence on allograft failure [48] , while others found that older recipient age and prolonged cold ischemia time increased the risk of graft failure [49] . One of the larger studies investigated the impact of age in living-donor liver transplantation by following recipients over 60 years of age over a 10-year period. They found the following parameters as risk factors influencing survival rate in patients after LDLT: MELD score equal to or greater than 25; Child's classification C; preoperative status of the recipient being in an intensive care unit; and blood type incompatibility. Recipient age of 60 years of age or older had no influence on the survival. 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival of the recipients older than 60 years were 81.9, 78.7, and 78.7%, respectively. Interestingly, their results in older patients were better than in younger patients (1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals in patients younger than 60 years is 75, 70.8, and 69.3%, respectively). A possible explanation for this better survival is that the selection criteria of older recipients were more stringent. The MELD score for older group recipients was significantly lower, and high-risk older patients were not considered for LDLT as a treatment option for their advanced liver disease in that study [43] .",

With increases in life expectancy and improvements in medical care, more elderly patients are being seen by cardiologists and cardiac surgeons for end-stage heart failure. Cardiac transplantation is the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage heart failure who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy. The 2007 report from the Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) estimated that slightly more than 5,000 heart transplants are performed annually worldwide [61] . The SRTR estimates that anywhere from 2,000 to 2,400 heart transplants were performed in the Older patients have been excluded from consideration for heart transplantation in the past, typically due to the supposed adverse effect of increased age on long-term survival and the shortage of donor organs. However, advances in posttransplant care have improved outcomes in older patients, and several centers have demonstrated results comparable to younger patients. The criteria regarding the recipient's older age limit continue to be expanded, and older patients are increasingly being considered as potential heart transplant candidates [62] [63] [64] [65] .",

The ideal heart transplant candidate is a person with endstage heart disease for whom conventional therapy is not likely to provide acceptable symptomatic benefit or satisfactorily improve life expectancy. The Clinical Practice Committee of the American Society of Transplantation published recommendations in 2001 for considering heart transplantation in patients with cardiac conditions that have not responded to maximal medical management [13] . Although severe heart failure refractory to medical therapy is the most common indication for transplantation, other circumstances warranting transplant include severely limiting ischemia not amenable to interventional or surgical revascularization, recurrent symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmia refractory to medical therapy, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or surgery and rarely, for the management of cardiac tumors. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy accounts for approximately 45% of cases, and coronary artery disease accounts for about 38% of cases. Nonischemic conditions include systolic heart failure, defined by left ventricular ejection fraction < 35% (Ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease); intractable arrhythmia uncontrolled with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with persistent heart failure despite valve replacement, pacemaker, or medical therapy.",

The prognosis of HIV has changed since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and guidelines are being amended so that HIV infection itself is not a sufficient reason to refuse heart transplantation [68] . Age greater than 70 years was an absolute contraindication in previous guidelines, but the ISHLT has recently modified their recommendations in 2006 to state that \"carefully selected patients > 70 years of age may be considered for cardiac transplantation. For centers considering these patients, the use of an alternate-type program (i.e., use of older donors) may be pursued.\" [63] The guidelines regarding neoplasm were also modified, with new consideration being given to tumors with low recurrence rate, response to therapy, and negative metastatic workup.",

The percentage of patients 50-64 years of age receiving lung transplants has not changed substantially over the past few years, with 54% of deceased-donor lungs going to these patients in 2007, up slightly from 48% in 1997. The most recent data list 1,005 active patients on the waiting list, with 91 (9%) being over the age of 65. The median time to transplant in this elderly group is 57 days. Donor lung shortage has been the major limiting factor to the number of lung transplants performed. The procurement rate of lung from deceased donors has consistently been lower than those for kidney, liver, and heart. While kidneys and livers are harvested from more than 85% of all cadaveric donors, and hearts from 30% of deceased donors, lungs are harvested from only 15% of all cadaveric donors [1]. This discrepancy may be attributed to the lung's vulnerability to potential complications that arise before and after donor death such as aspiration, pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Over the past several years, the number of single lung transplants performed annually in the United States has remained stable, while the number of bilateral transplants has consistently increased and even surpassed the number of single lung procedures [81] .",

It is not delineated if this survival advantage is related to the underlying patient characteristics or choice of operation. The impact of underlying diagnosis on survival after lung transplantation has often been linked to age, with older recipients having a significantly shorter survival than younger ones. Recipients with COPD have the best 1-year survival, but a lower 10-year survival when compared to those with cystic fibrosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

            "text": "Kidney and liver transplantation has been successfully performed and results substantiated in patients over the age of 70. The results depend on the selectivity used to identify those elderly candidates on the waiting list for transplant. Cardiac and lung transplants have shown some promising results in patients over the age of 65, but not over the age of 70. It is important to note that with cardiac and lung transplantation, there is a slight discrepancy with the proportion of elderly patients on the waiting list and with overall survival rates. This is likely due to patient selection more than the overall results. This patient population is a highly selective group of elderly patients with cardiac and lung disease, who are often not placed on the waiting list until they worsen clinically. All things being equal, discrimination against older candidates for organ transplantation on age-related grounds alone is not warranted. Despite potential utilitarian gains to be made limiting transplantation in the elderly recipients, the sense of fairness in the system will be harmed. Elderly patients who are healthy will be the ones who suffer. Older patients already face huge hurdles to get on the waiting list for transplantation, and they are already such a small number. There already is enough discrimination against the elderly, and we ought not to add to that injustice by further limiting their access. ",
