Radiographs of each foot were acquired first in a bipodal stance, immediately followed by the same radiographic projections obtained in a unipodal stance. The following measurements were recorded for each stance: distal interphalangeal joint (DIPJ) space width on both projections; mediolateral joint balance as the difference between lateral and medial DIPJ space widths on DP projections; extensor process-to-middle phalangeal condyle distance; and deep digital flexor tendon angle on LM projections. Statistical significance was tested using a matched pairs design and student's t-test with a 95% confidence level. Compared to a bipodal stance, lateral DIPJ space width was significantly reduced on unipodal DP views, whereas mediolateral joint imbalance and to a lesser extent medial DIPJ space width were significantly increased.

Descriptive statistics were reported. Seventy-two horses had suspected NSE that resolved with medical treatment; 59 of 62 horses underwent laparotomy when medical management failed, and three were subjected to euthanasia without surgery. Twenty-five of the 59 horses had confirmed NSE that was surgically corrected, and 34 had lesions other than or in addition to NSE. All horses that had surgically corrected NSE and 18 of 34 horses that had other lesions survived to hospital discharge.
