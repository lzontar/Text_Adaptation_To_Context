The investigation is due to the increasing number of diabetic patients in South Africa, where large segments of the population experience technological forms of exclusions. The context warrants research in geographical areas where ICT use is not pervasive yet. This research, used the UTAUT model with purposive sampling for 497 diabetic respondents, residing in low socio-economic communities. It analysed survey data using linear regression. It found that age had a strong moderating effect on all four UTAUT constructs. Gender only had a moderating effect on performance expectancy and social influence. In contrast to findings in the extant literature, income and location had no significant moderating effect in this context.",

However, it was found that \"having adequate (m-health) applications for diabetes, is low [20] . The low usage is prevalent, especially amongst older patients [20] . A population study in Germany supports this finding. It revealed that age and socio-economic status led to disparities in m-health usage [21] . However, the most prominent type of diabetes (90%) is type 2 diabetes [22] . Type 2 diabetes is most often diagnosed in older patients [22] . Therefore, the introduction of ICT, will not lead to the improvement of self-care unless it is accepted and used by the intended user population, i.e. older patients with diabetes [23] .",

It was found that the eight models used to develop UTAUT, including TRA, TPB and TAM, explained between 17% and 53% variance in user intentions to use technology [27] .

In that study, it was found that despite a high behavioural intention, there is low usage to almost 70% of the target population not using forms of ICT, such as mobile health. However, the Petersen et al. [29] study did account for how socio-demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, income or location), could explain the lack of use.

Therefore, intervention design in the case of ICT applications for diabetes self-management should take into consideration these factors.",
