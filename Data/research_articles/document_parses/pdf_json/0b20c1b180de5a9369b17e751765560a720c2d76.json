Such increase represents a huge shift of STEMI patients from a time frame where primary PCI is expected to provide substantial benefit, to a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f time frame where the benefit may be minimal. Although we were not able to directly ascertain that the significant patient-related delay is due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly likely that patients were reluctant to call EMS or present to the emergency department for fear of getting infected and/or transmitting infection to their close contacts. A similar pattern of delay in seeking medical care due to fear of contracting infection within the hospitals was seen in the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2013 as evident by a post epidemic survey. 11 Noteworthy, various other causes for patient-related delay in STEMI have been previously described in literature. 12, 13 However, considering that these causes remained largely unchanged between 2019 and 2020, as well as the fairly similar baseline characteristics of both groups, the COVID-19 pandemic comes out as the major new variable that could possibly explain this substantial difference in patient-related delay. Similar patterns from the United States 14 and Asia 15 were observed during the current pandemic. The significant drop in STEMI volume (33%) in our study is similar to that observed in the US (38%).
