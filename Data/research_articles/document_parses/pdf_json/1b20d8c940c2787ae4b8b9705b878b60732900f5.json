The CPIS score can be more valuable if used in conjunction with a good lower respiratory tract sample, which includes Gram staining [32]. In Of the various measures included in CPIS, oxygenation measured by the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen compared to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2 / FiO 2 ) has consistently proven to be a good indicator of outcome, particularly when followed serially [34] . Several biomarkers, including soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), procalcitonin (PCT), copeptin, and C-reactive protein (CRP), have been studied in patients with VAP.
