Currently, the cost and difficulty of testing limit diagnostic facilities to small mobile laboratories or centralized facilities with turnaround times measured in days rather than in a few hours, meaning that diagnosis is largely used to confirm disease. Ebola diagnosis can be achieved in two different ways: measuring the host-specific immune response to infection (e.g. IgM and IgG antibodies) and detection of viral particles (e.g. ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test Kit for VP40), or particle components in infected individuals (e.g. RT-PCR or PCR). The most general assay used for IgM and IgG antibody detection are direct ELISA assays. Considering the physiological kinetics of the humoral immune system as well as impaired antigenpresenting cell function as a result of viral hemorrhagic fever, antibody titers are low in the early stages and often undetectable in severe patients prior to death [6] . This leaves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for antigen detection as a viable option for early diagnostic assays. PCR is a chemical reaction that amplifies pieces of a virus's genes floating in the blood by more than a millionfold, which makes detection of pre-symptomatic individuals likely identifiable. Indeed, a research article published in 2000, illustrates the power of this technology to detect Ebola virus in humans in the pre-symptomatic stage [7] . In this study, 24 asymptomatic individuals who had been exposed to symptomatic Ebola patients were tested using PCR. Eleven of the exposed patients eventually developed the infection.

Hence, for the case of highly effective isolation, the parameters concerning early diagnosis and isolation have a significant impact on the reproduction number.
