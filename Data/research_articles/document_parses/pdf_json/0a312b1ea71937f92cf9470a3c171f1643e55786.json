The findings of the study point out a detrimental effect of the imbalanced class distribution on classification performance. In our dataset, there are very few COVID-19 class images compared to the other classes. To overcome this unfavorable situation, we perform a detailed offline augmentation over the COVID-19 class images in our dataset. Firstly, we obtain the mirrored version of the original images by flipping each image. Then, the listed augmentation technics are applied to both original and flipped images.1) Noise: Adding Gaussian noise to images, 2) Shear: Shearing the images in affine form, 3) Brightness decrease: Decreasing the brightness of the images by subtracting 30 from every pixel, 4) Brightness increase: Increasing the brightness of the images by adding 30 to every pixel. Offline augmentation: A demonstration on original image As Figure 5 describes, we obtain twelve different images from a single image with the aid of the augmentation techniques and their combinations. The same operations depicted in Figure 5 are also implemented to the flipped images, which are the mirrored versions of the original images. At the end of the day, we gain twenty-four different images for a single image. Thus, the number of images in the COVID-19 class is augmented offline in the pre-processing of the dataset resulting in an acceptable amount.
