Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "the European Union closed all its external borders to prevent a further spreading of the virus (European Commission 2020).

By 18 March, 2020, more than 250 million people in Europe were in lockdown (Wikipedia 2020) .

One possibility to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions is mathematical modeling (Hsu 2020) . Mathematical modeling of infectious disease dates back to Daniel Bernoulli in 1760 (Bernoulli 1760) and has been widely used in the epidemiology community since the 1920s (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) . The most common approach to model the epidemiology of an infectious disease is to represent the stages of the disease through a number of compartments and introduce constitutive relations that define how individual subpopulations transition between them (Hethcote 2000) . A popular compartment model is the SEIR model that represents the timeline of a disease through the interplay of the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations (Aron and Schwartz 1984) . The transition rates \u03b1 from exposed to infectious and \u03b3 from infectious to recovered are the inverses of the latent period A = 1/\u03b1, the time during which an individual is exposed but not yet infectious, and the infectious period C = 1/\u03b3, the time during which an individual can infect others (Li and Muldowney 1994) . In theory, both are disease specific parameters, independent of country, region, or city. For COVID-19, depending on the way of reporting, they can range between A = 2 to 6 days and C = 3 to 18 days (Park et al. 2020; Prem et al. 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 267, "text": "(Hsu 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 353, "end": 369, "text": "(Bernoulli 1760)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 441, "end": 470, "text": "(Kermack and McKendrick 1927)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 727, "end": 742, "text": "(Hethcote 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 922, "end": 946, "text": "(Aron and Schwartz 1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1264, "text": "(Li and Muldowney 1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1484, "text": "(Park et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1485, "end": 1502, "text": "Prem et al. 2020)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The most critical feature of any epidemiology model is the transition from the susceptible to the exposed state.

The product of the contact rate and the infectious period, R 0 = C \u03b2 = C/B, is called the basic reproduction number (Delamater et al. 2019) . It defines how many individuals are infected by a single one individual in an otherwise uninfected, susceptible population (Dietz 1993) . Naturally, the basic reproduction number provides valuable insight into the transmissibility of an infectious agent, and its change is a critical measure of behavioral changes and political actions (Fang et al. 2020 ).

To simulate the country-specific epidemiology of COVID-19 with the SEIR model, we utilize these data to identify the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B using the latent and infectious periods A = 1/\u03b1 = 2.56 days and C = 1/\u03b3 = 17.82 days, which we had previously identified for the COVID-19 outbreak in N = 30 Chinese provinces (Peirlinck et al. 2020 ), since the current European data are not yet complete for the identification of all three parameters. In addition to the basic reproduction number R 0 = C/B, which is a direct measure of the contact period B = 1/\u03b2, we also identify the initial community spread \u03c1 = E 0 /I 0 that defines the initial asymptomatic exposed population E 0 (Maier and Brockman 2020), and the affected population \u03b7 = N * /N that defines the fraction of the epidemic subpopulation N * relative to the total population N (Eurostat 2020).

These drastic measures have stimulated a wave of criticism, not only because they violate international law, but also because of a strong belief that they only slow, but do not halter, the spread of the pandemic (Mason Meier et al. 2020) . A recent study based on a global metapopulation disease transmission model for the COVID-19 outbreak in China has shown that the Wuhan travel ban essentially came too late, at a point where most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers (Chinazzi et al. 2020 ). Our study shows a similar trend for Europe, where travel restrictions were only implemented a week after every country had reported cases of COVID-19 (Johns Hopkins University 2020). Nonetheless, our side-by-side comparison of simulations with and without travel restrictions illustrates the rapid spreading of COVID-19 across Central Europe. Our results suggest that the emerging pattern of the COVID-19 outbreak closely follows global mobility patterns of air passenger travel (Pastor et al. 2015) : From its European origin in Italy, the coronavirus spread rapidly via the strongest network connections to Germany, Spain, and France, while slowly reaching the less connected countries, Estonia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Figure 3 supports the decision of the European Union and its local governments to implement rigorous travel restrictions in an attempt to delay the outbreak of the pandemic. Austria, for example, rapidly introduced drastic mitigation strategies including strict border control and massive travel bans. Its national air travel was cut in half by March 20 and soon after converged to a reduction of 95% (Eurostat 2020 ). This has rapidly reduced the number of new cases to a current fraction of 10% of its all time high three weeks ago (Johns Hopkins University 2020), which has motivated a gradual lift of the current constraints. Our prognosis for Austria in Figure 3 suggests that, without travel restrictions, Austria would still see a rise of the infected population. Critics argue that community-based public health measures such as physical distancing, contact tracing, and isolation would be equally successful, but less restrictive, alternatives to restricting the freedom of movement (Mason Meier et al. 2020 ). Admittedly, this points toward a limitation of our current model in which the basic reproduction number is constant and does not account for local mitigation strategies (Peirlinck et al. 2020) .
