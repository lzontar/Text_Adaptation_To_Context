Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression *p < 0.05 in multivariable models moderate or severe BPD beginning at 36 weeks PMA with serial echocardiography thereafter [5] . Compared to cardiac catheterization, echocardiographic screening for PH has been limited in its ability to detect and grade the severity of pulmonary hypertension [7] . We found that infants with documented abnormal RVSP or septal position had approximately double the odds of mortality, compared to infants with normal echocardiographic parameters. This association persisted even after adjusting for other significant predictors of mortality including gestational age, receipt of mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks' PMA, atrial septal defect, bloodstream infection, postnatal corticosteroid use, and PMA at admission to the participating center.

Mourani et al. found that the sensitivity and positive-predictive value of echocardiographic parameters for the detection of PH is enhanced when tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity can be measured as a proxy for pulmonary artery pressure [7] . Unfortunately, several studies have noted the challenge of obtaining tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity measurements, even when echocardiography is being performed in accordance with prespecified research protocols and on older pediatric patients [19, 20] . Indeed, in our cohort, tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and resultant right ventricular systolic pressure was recorded in only 27% of echocardiographic reports, highlighting the practical limitations of obtaining this important variable at the bedside. Septal position was more commonly documented in our cohort, with 73% of echocardiographic reports having documentation of septal position. Assignment of septal position may be subject to considerable subjectivity and interobserver variability [21] . More quantitative measures of septal position, such as eccentricity index, are now being investigated in infants with BPD and hold promise as a means of standardizing the echocardiographic approach [19, 22] . Nonetheless, our finding that infants with missing echocardiographic data had mortality rates similar to infants with documented normal echocardiographic parameters suggests that the inherent difficulties of obtaining standard echocardiographic measurements should not prevent efforts at screening. Further, echocardiography correctly identified infants who were likely to survive, as shown by the high specificity and negative predictive values of both septal flattening and RVSP in our study. As such, septal position and RVSP measures on echocardiography between 34 and 44 weeks' PMA can be helpful in delineating risk status for in-hospital mortality in infants with sBPD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 488, "end": 491, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 741, "end": 745, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1254, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1459, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1463, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Surprisingly, only half of our initial cohort of infants with severe BPD had screening echocardiography between 34 and 44 weeks' PMA.

This survey found that 83% of physicians would obtain an echocardiogram at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age for infants with moderate or severe BPD, but only 46% of respondents had a formal screening program in place at their institution that facilitated the implementation of these guidelines [23] . Our study cohort occurred prior to the publication of the recent American Heart Association screening guidelines; future work, including our observations in this study, should serve to increase the rate of screening for PH in infants with BPD. Quality initiatives to standardize the approach to PH screening in infants with BPD across sites are now being developed. Even as screening efforts advance, we acknowledge that data are limited on whether early detection and pharmacologic treatment of pulmonary hypertension in infants with severe BPD improves survival. Retrospective evaluations of this association may be plagued with concerns about confounding by indication, and the feasibility and cost of randomized controlled trials can be prohibitive. Additionally, the natural course of milder forms of pulmonary hypertension is to resolve without pharmacologic therapy [24, 25] . However, identifying the patients at risk for poor outcomes is essential in the neonatal period to allow appropriate risk categorization and followup after hospital discharge. Overall, one in four infants with severe BPD may develop pulmonary hypertension, but 41 \u221262% will be diagnosed after hospital discharge and will experience morbidity and mortality in the first year of life as a result of their diagnosis [1, 2, 24, 26] . As such, even while the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary hypertension is being evaluated, echocardiographic screening for infants with severe BPD may allow proven interventions such as aggressive management of respiratory acidosis, prevention of intermittent hypoxia, targeting of optimal nutrition and feeding modes, and engagement of multidisciplinary care to be employed early and aggressively in order to improve outcomes for high-risk infants [1, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 537, "end": 541, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1421, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1425, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1841, "end": 1844, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1845, "end": 1847, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1851, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1852, "end": 1855, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2324, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2325, "end": 2329, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2334, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2335, "end": 2339, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2340, "end": 2344, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2349, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has important limitations.
