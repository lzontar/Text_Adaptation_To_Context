Also, the level of lithium can be affected by various causes, including the interaction with other medications, patients' illness, and infection. Lithium intoxication leads to numerous fatal complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, neurological disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and kidney failure [3, 4] .
