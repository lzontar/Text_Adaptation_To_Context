In a study of feline CoV 50 positive cats, 90% had antigen detected in the conjunctiva after testing conjunctival swabs, 51 suggesting ocular tissues and tears could be infectious. (4) Human studies assessing ocular 52 transmission of coronaviruses are needed to confirm these theories from animal models. 53 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2003 54 Given that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from the same family of coronaviruses and 55 share phylogenetic similarity, it seems likely that findings from the SARS epidemic of 2003 may 56 be demonstrated with COVID-19. SARS-CoV was found to have a primary mode of 57 transmission through direct or indirect contact of infectious droplets with mucous membranes 58 including the eyes, nose, or mouth. (5) A study of health care workers infected by contact with 59 intubated patients with confirmed SARS demonstrated a statistically significant relationship (p-60 value= 0.001) between infection and eye protection. Health care workers who did not properly 61 wear goggles or other eye protection had higher rates of infection compared to those who did, 62 yielding an odds ratio of 7.34. (6) This study provided evidence that ocular transmission of 63 respiratory illness may occur without eye protection, particularly in healthcare settings, and 64 highlights that the conjunctiva could have been a portal for entry for SARS-CoV. 65 Furthermore, a 2003 case series first reported the detection of SARS-CoV in tears after 66 RT-PCR analysis. In this study of 36 patients with probable SARS, three patients were found to 67 have tear samples positive for SARS-CoV via conjunctival swab. (7) The samples were collected at one time point for each patient no more than nine days after onset of fever. This study 69 highlighted the second possibility demonstrating the ocular transmission of SARS: that the tears 70 are direct sources of infectious material. Given there is a viral load in tears, it is possible that 71 contact with the eye and subsequent fomites can lead to inoculation of the virus in other persons 72 much in the way demonstrated by respiratory droplets. The authors from this study 73 recommended against the use of reusable eye equipment such as applanation tonometers and 74 urged the use of goggles in addition to masks, gowns, and gloves for PPE. 75 Ocular COVID-19 Studies 76 There are currently few peer-reviewed studies demonstrating ocular manifestations of 77 SARS-CoV-2; most studies published to date originate from China and consist of small case 78 series. A study of 38 COVID-19 positive patients in Hubei Province, China demonstrated that 79 12 patients reported ocular symptoms and two had positive conjunctival swabs. (8) Signs 80 included conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, epiphora, or increased ocular secretions. The 81 roughly one third of patients who were found to have ocular signs were noted to have more 82 severe manifestations of COVID-19 in general. 83 Other smaller studies have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is shed in tears, albeit with a low 84 incidence. A study at Wuhan University identified 67 laboratory-confirmed or suspected 85 COVID-19 positive patients. Of these patients, three had positive RT-PCR results from 86 conjunctival swab but no ocular symptoms. (9) One patient reported conjunctivitis as his first 87 symptom but had a subsequent negative conjunctival swab. Another single-center cross-sectional 88 study at Tongji Hospital in Shanghai, China demonstrated similar results. Of 72 patients with 89 laboratory confirmed COVID-19, two patients reported conjunctivitis and of the two, only one 90 tested positive via RT-PCR from conjunctival swab. (10) A prospective interventional study was also performed at Zhejiang University. The protocol called for two tear and conjunctival 92 collections per patient at intervals of two to three days which were tested via RT-PCR. Of 30 93 patients enrolled, only one patient had conjunctivitis and he was the sole patient with positive 94 conjunctival swab. (11) 95 A case report from Shenzhen, China highlighted a patient presenting with bilateral ocular 96 redness, foreign body sensation, and tearing without blurred vision on day 13 after developing 97 systemic COVID-19 symptoms. (12) The patient then had a slit lamp examination that showed 98 bilateral moderate conjunctival injection, watery discharge, inferior palpebral conjunctival 99 follicles, and tender palpable preauricular lymph nodes consistent with acute viral conjunctivitis. 100 RT-PCR results from conjunctival swab on days 13, 14, and 17 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 101 but were found to be in lower concentration than respiratory specimens. The patient was treated 102 with ribavirin eye drops and had resolution of ocular symptoms by day 19 of illness. 103 Similarly, a case report from the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, Italy 104 confirmed ocular symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR conjunctival samples in a 105 COVID-19 positive patient.

            "text": "122we recommend including questions for the eye portion of the review of systems. Suspected 123 COVID-19 patients should be asked about eye redness, itching, and discharge when a full review 124 of systems is sought by the emergency physician. Emergency physicians should also include 125 COVID-19 in their differential diagnosis for patients presenting with conjunctivitis or isolated 126 ocular signs given the various aforementioned case reports demonstrating conjunctivitis as a first 127 symptom of the disease. 128In addition, we recommend informing patients of the possibility of ocular transmission of 129 SARS-CoV-2. This includes informing patients that there has been anecdotal demonstration of 130 COVID-19 seropositivity with isolated ocular symptoms and signs. Regardless of whether they 131have ocular signs, patients should be instructed to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth to 132 prevent viral spread. They should be advised to discontinue contact lens use if conjunctivitis is 133 diagnosed. In addition, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) has recently published 134 an article asking all contact lens wearers to consider switching to glasses during this outbreak. 135 (14) They urge that reducing contact lens use will reduce the amount of times the patient touches the eye and can provide a physical barrier between respiratory droplets and ocular mucosa in 137 order to limit ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 138For the ophthalmic examination in particular, universal precautions should be followed139 including standard infection prevention strategies as well as new approaches geared toward 140 COVID-19, as outlined by AAO. (15) Disposable equipment such as tonometer tips should be 141 used wherever possible and ophthalmic examination should be performed in a limited number of 142 rooms by a limited number of people. Equipment including slit lamps should be thoroughly 143 wiped down with disinfectant wipes, as should all other surfaces in the patient room. Extra 144 caution should be taken during ophthalmic examinations due to the close proximity of the 145 provider's and patient's face. AAO has recommended the use of N95 masks for ophthalmologists 146 or other physicians providing ophthalmic care to patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2 147 for this reason. (15) Given the shortage of PPE, if N95 is not available, a surgical face mask 148 should still be worn by both parties. If the patient's presentation constitutes a slit lamp 149 examination, breath shields should be installed on all slit lamps, and the patient should be 150 instructed to refrain from speaking during the exam. The use of a direct ophthalmoscope should 151 also be limited in the emergency department setting. 152 Conclusion 153 SARS-CoV-2 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets, though aerosolized 154 transmission is important as well. The eye may represent a source of transmission through 155 infected tears as well as a window for infection via respiratory droplets or aerosolized particles 156 contacting the conjunctiva. Moving forward, all emergency departments, hospitals, and physician 157 offices should follow precautions to limit potential ocular transmission of COVID-19.
