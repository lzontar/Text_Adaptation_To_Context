Our estimation approach relies on countypairs across state-borders where one state has SIPO whereas the other state does not, controls for matched county-pair fixed effects and day of observation fixed-effects. The county-pair sample from southern, mid-western, and mountain region states (from March 1, 2020 to April 25, 2020) shows that daily COVID-19 incidence case growth rate is 1.994 percentage points lower for counties in SIPO states relative to those bordering in non-SIPO states. Specifically, we find SIPO reduced daily growth rates by 1.97, 2.14, 2.03, and 2.27 percentage points after 1 to 5 days, 6 to 10 days, 11 to 15 days, and 16 to 20 days, respectively. Our effect sizes are much smaller than in the previous studies with the caveat that states in the northeast and on the west coast could not be included in the border county-pair specification. We find limited evidence of heterogeneous effects in counties with a higher population density, percentage of black or Hispanic residents, proportion of population over 65 years, and social association rates in a county. Nor do we find evidence of meaningful differences in effects of SIPO by county Gini index, unemployment, or GDP.

As such, much of the available data remains right-censored. Though causality is difficult to establish, the border-county pair analysis along with matched-pair county and day fixed-effects and three-way clustering aim to provide additional estimates to the ongoing stream of studies on SIPO and decline of COVID-19. Though closures of offices and schools from across state lines might spillover across border county, such effects would downward bias our estimates and control for matched-pair county fixed-effects control for potential spillovers. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the US COVID-19 pandemic daily growth rate slowed at 1.99 percentage points in SIPO counties relative to non-SIPO counties and suggests smaller benefits of SIPO.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": ".
