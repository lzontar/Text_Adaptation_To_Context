The COVID-19 pandemic has swept into over 200 countires with considerable confirmed cases and deaths, and has caused public panic and mental health stress. In China, the public has shown severe anxiety-related behaviors, causing a significant shortage of medical related materials across the country. Besides, many front-line medical staff work overloaded for a long time causing them to not get enough rest. Evidence indicated that mental health problems could occur in both healthcare workers and survivors during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak (Lee et al., 2007Lee et al., 2018 . Based on the above research evidence, we have reason to speculate that the psychological condition of the Chinese public may also be affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover, nearly one in five participants had depressive symptoms and sleep problems, indicating that the uncertainty of the outbreak progression would cause greater psychological stress on the Chinese public.
