These 14 viruses belong to two lineages: one from Guangdong (GD/P) and the other from 15 Guangxi (GX/P). The GD/P viruses are particularly intriguing as the amino-acid 16 sequence of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein is very similar to that of 17 the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (97.4%) 2 . This characteristic suggests that GD/P viruses 18 are capable of binding human ACE2 receptor and may therefore be able to mediate 19 infection of human cells. Whereas all six GX/P genomes were deposited as annotated 20 sequences in GenBank, none of the two GD/P genomes assembled in previous studies 2,3 21 are currently available. To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the 22 Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in 23 five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD/P virus of 24 poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the 25",

The GD/P2S dataset 2 contains reads that are 26 identical to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting either the coexistence of two SARS-CoV-2-like 27 viruses in the same pangolin or contamination by the human virus. In the four other 28 GD/P datasets 1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from 29 three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified 30 three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD/P sequences. Such low levels of 31 polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus 32 raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were 33 infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity. 34",

            "text": ", many mitochondrial reads of pangolin (\u2265 7727) 60 were found for these four GD/P samples. Pairwise distances between assembled 61 mitochondrial genomes were between 0.12% -0.41%, confirming the four samples were 62 collected on different pangolins, and suggesting they came from different localities in 63 Southeast Asia. It should be noted mitochondrial reads could not be analysed for GD/P2S 64 because the authors 2 have removed all non-viral reads. It is therefore impossible to prove that 65 the pangolin (GD/P2S) analysed by Lam et al. 2 differs from those studied by Liu et al. 1 . 66 Surprisingly, numerous mitochondrial reads from other species (nucleotide identity = 100%) 67 were also detected in the sequencing data. The GD/P7L dataset contains 1634 reads of mouse 68 (Mus musculus), representing 2% of pangolin reads. The GD/P8L dataset contains 183 mouse 69 reads (2%), and 1333 human reads (17%) (M7b haplogroup, which is found in humans from 70 China and Southeast Asia). The GD/P9L dataset includes 3447 reads of tiger, subspecies 71 Panthera tigris altaica (25%) and the GD/P11L dataset includes 1394 tiger reads (<1%). This 72 unexpected range of mammalian species that I have identified clearly warrants an 73 explanation. The most likely hypotheses are that laboratory experiments were contaminated 74 by RNA molecules from multiple organisms, or that different RNA extractions were pooled 75 into the same library. 76 When the five partial GD/P genomes were compared to each other, only three 77 nucleotide sites were found to be polymorphic: (1) position 1807: A in 21 GD/P2S reads 78 versus C in four GD/P8L reads; (2) position 5228: A in two GD/P9L reads, one GD/P7L read, 79 and one GD/P8L read versus C in three GD/P2S reads; (3) position 24979: G in 15 GD/P2S 80 reads and one GD/P8L read versus A in three GD/P7L reads. Considering the low-coverage 81 of GD/P genomes, these differences can be interpreted as sequencing errors. I suggest 82therefore that all five pangolins were infected by the same GD/P virus strain, approximately 83 at the same time, and most probably during their captivity 5 . I decided therefore to assemble a 84 consensus GD/P genome by pooling together all reads sequenced from the five GD/P 85 samples. The quality of the assembled genome is still very low with a mean coverage of 13X 86 being composed of 26 fragments and containing 6.4 % missing data by comparison with the 87 human SARS-CoV-2 genome. In particular, the sequence of the gene coding for the spike 88 protein is composed of three fragments and includes 6.4 % missing data. 89Reliable whole genome sequences of the virus detected in pangolins from Guangdong 90 are crucial to better understand the origin of Covid-19. These sequences could be used in 91 many studies, in particular to estimate mutation and recombination rates during the 92 evolutionary history of viruses related to SARS-CoV-2. For this reason, I strongly encourage 93",
