However immunological insights are restricted due to a lack of ferretspecific reagents and limited genetic information about ferret B and T cell receptors. Here, variable, diversity and joining genes within the ferret kappa, lambda and heavy chain immunoglobulin loci were annotated using available genomic information. A multiplex PCR approach was derived that facilitated the recovery of paired heavy and light chain immunoglobulin sequences from single sorted ferret B cells, allowing validation of predicted germline gene sequences and the identification of putative novel germlines. Eukaryotic expression vectors were developed that enabled the generation of recombinant ferret monoclonal antibodies. This work advances the ferret as an informative immunological model for viral diseases by allowing the in-depth interrogation of antibody-based immunity.",

Primary reactions were carried out in 50\u03bcL volumes using Hotstart Taq plus polymerase (Qiagen), 1X reaction buffer, 2.0 mM MgCl 2, 0.1mM dNTP (Bioline) and 5 nmol each of primary forward and reverse primer pools (S1 Table) . 4\u03bcL of primary PCR product was used as template in a secondary, nested PCR (50 \u03bcL volume) containing 1 X reaction buffer, 1.5mM MgCl 2 , 1 x solution Q and 5 nmol secondary forward and reverse primer pools (S1 Table) . For recovery of antigen-specific B cells from an infected ferret, the protocol was amended by substituting primary and secondary heavy chain reverse primer pools with 5 nmol reverse primer binding in the heavy chain joining gene (IGHJ) (S1 Table) . Cycling conditions for both heavy and light chain amplification are as follows: Primary PCR: 95\u02daC for 5 mins, 50 cycles of 95\u02daC for 30s, 55\u02daC for 30s and 72\u02daC for 55s. Final extension for 7 mins at 72\u02daC. Secondary PCR: 95\u02daC for 5 mins, 50 cycles of 95\u02daC for 30s, 50\u02daC for 30s and 72\u02daC for 60s. Final extension for 7 mins at 72\u02daC. PCR products were visualised by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to standard purification and standard sanger sequencing using the reverse constant chain primer (IgM, IgK, IgL) from the secondary amplification steps or the IGHJ reverse primer.",

We therefore identified and annotated genomic contigs containing potential heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes using iterative rounds of BLAST. A total of 27 unique IGHV-like genes were initially identified, including potential pseudogenes and/or non-functional segments. 20 IGHV genes retaining an open reading frame (ORF), downstream recombination signal sequence (RSS; heptamer and nonomer) and critical amino acid residues (eg. Cys 74) were considered potentially functional, although 4 of these lacked identifiable functional leader exons. Based on DNA sequence homology, three groupings of immunoglobulin genes, corresponding to the three vertebrate \"clans\" [21] could be delineated ( Fig 1A) : clan I (3 genes), clan II (1 gene) and clan III (16 genes). In line with reports from other Carnivora such as dogs [22] and cats [23] , the majority of IGHV gene diversity in ferrets lies within Clan III (human IGHV3-21 or 3-69 homology), with sequence variance concentrated within the CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 regions ( Fig 1B) . Based upon the conserved arrangement of RSS sequences, we identified 7 putative D gene segments (numbered IGHD1-7) (Fig 1C) , of which 3 appear orthologous to canine, murine and/ or human variants. Similarly, 5 putative germline J gene segments (IGHJ1-5) were identified ( Fig 1D) including 2 conserved orthologues.",

Nevertheless, we recovered clusters of IGHV gene sequences that were highly conserved (>99% homology) to predicted germlines including examples from two of the three clans (II-HV1, III-HV7, III-HV8, III-HV9, III-HV12, III-HV16). A single clan I sequence was recovered, albeit with more limited homology to the putative germline gene (97.6%). The 18-20 IGHV genes we found within genomic contigs is less than observed in felines (24 genes) and canines (38 genes) [24] , suggesting additional variable germlines may remain undiscovered. Supporting this, we repeatedly recovered multiple heavy chain immunoglobulin sequences that shared identical IGHV gene sequences, but recombined with different D and J genes, strongly suggestive of a common germline progenitor (III-HV17, III-HV18, III-HV19 and III-HV20, III-HV21). The existence and identity of these additional putative germlines (listed in S1 Table) will be clarified as genomic sequencing of ferrets continues. Utilisation of all five predicted IGHJ gene segments and 6 of 7 IGHD gene segments (not IGHD6) was evident within recombined BCR sequences. CDR-H3 regions, often a critical determinant for antigen recognition, ranged from 5 to 25 amino acids (mean 13.2) in length ( Fig 3C) ; broadly comparable to canines [25] and potentially shorter on average than observed in humans [26] .",

Annotation of genomic immunoglobulin gene segments enabled the design of a multiplex PCR approach to recover ferret BCR sequences. A broad cross-section of predicted germline segments from both heavy and light chain loci were amplified, including several potentially novel germline genes currently absent from available genomic contigs. We noted highly biased V gene utilisation for both heavy and light chain na\u00efve repertoires, with a majority of recovered sequences derived from the most numerous V gene clans (which we termed HV-III, KV-II and LV-II respectively). This observation mirrors the gene distribution in other carnivores, where majority of recovered heavy chain sequences are similarly biased [22, 23, 33, 34] . Light chain bias has been reported for mice (kappa) [35] and both dogs and cats (lambda) [36] . However, humans display more balanced usage of both the kappa and lambda chains [34, 37] , as did ferrets in the current study. The distribution of ferret CDR-H3 (mode 13-14 AA) and lambda and kappa CDR-L3 lengths (mode 11 AA and 8-9 AA respectively) were broadly similar to reports from cats [23] , dogs [33] and humans [38] . Using the new information on ferret Ig sequences, we were able to generate a chimeric ferret/human mAb that retained specificity for influenza HA, and also two novel fully ferret mAbs that exhibited potent binding and neutralisation against A/California/04/2009. These reagents and similar mAbs could be used in repeated immunotherapy studies in ferrets with less concern about the generation of ferret-anti-human responses to human mAbs. We note that while we were successful in the recombinant expression of chimeric human/ferret or fully ferret lambda chain utilising antibodies, further work is needed to generate analogous kappa chain utilising mAbs.",

While we employed a multiplex PCR approach to amplify immunoglobulin genes, the use of template switching based methods such as 5'RACE has been applied to other species such as dogs [39] and may reduce the potential for primer bias driving preferentially recovery of specific immunoglobulin gene segzments. Alternatively, next generation high throughput approaches and tools for the analysis of large RNA-seq data sets such as VDJPuzzle [40] , BraCer [41] , BALDR [42] and BASIC [43] have been deployed for analysis of antibody repertoires from cats [44] and rhesus macaques [45] . While the entire ferret kappa loci is assembled in the current copy of the ferret genome, the lambda and heavy chain loci were distributed across a number of contigs and the gene arrangement of these two loci remains unclear. Recent advances in long-read NGS approaches such as Oxford Nanopore [46] technologies could enable high resolution mapping of these loci in ferrets, as recently demonstrated by the assembly of reference gene loci in rhesus macaques [45] which facilitates the in depth analysis of antigen-specific immunoglobulin gene repertoires and the characterisation of antigenic epitopes [47] . Additional germline inference methods such as IgDiscover [48] and TIgER [49] could also be deployed in ferrets to more accurately assess and categorise allelic variation within these outbred animals.",

We identified two ferret mAbs, derived from a single clonally expanded family, which displayed anti-HA reactivity and mediated virus neutralisation in vitro. Interestingly, a single mutation (K163E) was able to mediate complete escape from neutralising activity, and similar mutations have been described in both circulating viruses in human populations [55] and from viral escape mutants selected under pressure from human serum [31, 32] or mAbs [56] . Futher cataloguing differential recognition of HA at the mAb level would complement serological studies, since serum samples from humans, guinea pigs, mice and ferrets have been shown to exhibit differential immunodominance hierarchies within polyclonal responses targeting the canonical epitopes of HA [57] and drive different patterns of viral escape [58] . The tools reported in the current study may also be informative for other emerging human respiratory viruses, most notably the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Ferrets can be productively infected with SARS-CoV2 [59, 60] and will serve as a critical model for testing therapeutic options and vaccines against the virus. The capacity to characterise immune repertoires and recover ferret mAbs from SARS-CoV2 infected or immunised ferrets might further support global efforts to develop effective countermeasures against COVID-19.",
