Here we used Vienna RNA 1.5 4 to predict the 5' UTR secondary structures of nine coronaviruses (summarized in Table 1 ). The results of Vienna RNA folding predictions carried out for MHV and SARS-CoV are shown in Figure 1 . All coronavirus 5' UTR secondary structural models are strikingly similar, and are characterized by three major helical stems, denoted SL1, SL2, and SL4. Some sequences show a fourth stem-loop, denoted SL3, in which the leader TRS (TRS-L) is folded into a hairpin loop. SL2 is absolutely conserved and previously unrecognized. The (C/U)UUG(U/C) pentaloop sequence is the most highly conserved contiguous run of nucleotides in the entire 5' UTR outside of the core TRS-L, and covariation analysis clearly reveals that this loop is always stacked on a 5-bp helix.

In a UNR loop, U 0 is stacked on the noncanonical base pair and is engaged in two critical hydrogen bonds: the U 0 imino proton donates a hydrogen bond to the nonbridging phosphate oxygen following R +2 , and the U 0 2'-OH proton donates a hydrogen bond to the N7 of R +2. Substitution of U 0 with any other nucleotide will abrogate formation of these hydrogen bonds and therefore destabilize the loop.

Our genetic and biophysical studies support the prediction of SL2 being a UNR U-turn stem-loop. One feature shared by both models is a stem-loop designated as stem-loop III in the earlier BCoV model, which corresponds to stem-loop 4B in our model. The previous BCoV minimum free energy model is also supported by nuclease mapping studies, particularly for stem-loop III, and by genetic studies using DI RNAs. This raises the remote possibility, not addressed here, that the two competing confirmations may exist in equilibrium and perhaps have different functional roles in coronavirus replication.
