In hospitals, clinics, physician offices, and clinical laboratories, LF-based tests are used for the qualitative and quantitative detection of a wide variety of antigens and antibodies. More recently, they are being developed to measure the products of gene amplification. They can be used to test just about any biological sample, including urine, tears, sweat, saliva, serum, plasma, whole blood, and biopsied tissue and fluids. LF-based tests are also used in veterinary medicine, for quality control, to assure product safety in food production, environmental testing, water safety, and pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturing. In these circumstances, rapid tests are used to screen for pathogens and toxins in raw materials, the manufacturing environment, and the finished product. Water utilities test drinking water for chemical toxins, metals, and pathogens. Rapid test systems are also used to assess progress in environmental remediation of soil and ground water pollutants. Veterinarians use rapid tests to screen commercial livestock and household pets for a number of medical conditions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Another reason for the continued popularity of LF tests is the low development cost and ease of production.

Predictions are that patient self-testing will skyrocket because of rising consumer expectations, technological innovations, and the surge of consumer activism in healthcare.

A patent does not prevent competition, it encourages competition. Once the patent is published, the whole world knows what the patentee is doing and has a detailed road map of the invention and its intended use.

Lateral flow is best for yes/no type tests. If you need quantitation, then they probably are not as good as some of the other new technologies are more appropriate.
