They reviewed surveys conducted between 1990 and 2019 at 1,062 locations in 88 countries. Many of the 153 surveys they assessed were observational, meaning that investigators had visited households and seen handwashing stations for themselves.",

However, as high as it is, that number may actually be quite conservative-the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene put the estimate at just over 3 billion people in 2017. 8 The Brauer team's model, which also estimated long-term trends over the 30-year study period, did show expansion of access in some locations. This reflects progress toward improving sanitation and reducing childhood mortality, Brauer says. Yet, the study showed access is still limited overall, particularly among rural populations and informal urban slums in the developing world. Modeling suggested that more than half the population in the provinces of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Nairobi, Kenya, lack access to handwashing facilities.",
