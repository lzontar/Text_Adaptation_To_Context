The COVID-19 Contact (CoCo) Study follows 217 frontline health-care professionals at a university hospital with weekly SARS-CoV-2-specific serology (IgA/IgG). Study participants estimated their personal likelihood of having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection with a mean of 21% [median 15%, interquartile range (IQR) 5-30%]. In contrast, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG prevalence was about 1-2% at baseline.

We confirmed the specificity in a set of 156 sera from non-European refugees and migrants [7] collected in 2015 as negative controls (mean age 31.6 years, range 18-67 years, 78% male). All but one tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (specificity 99.3%) and 2 out of 90 tested equivocal positive for IgA (specificity 97.8%). The serum of 18 patients after recovery of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 served as positive controls or to generate a standard curve (mean age 44.8 years; mean duration of symptoms 11.8 days, range 3-35 days; mean time since start of symptoms 30.4 days, range 21-61 days). 16/18 tested positive (n = 1 equivocal positive) for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (sensitivity 90%) and 15/18 positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgA (sensitivity 85.7%). Interestingly, the duration of symptoms as a surrogate for disease severity correlated significantly with the IgG ratio (extinction of sample to calibrator ratio) of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Fig. 1a) .",

Both positive results were about 20-fold lower as compared to one patient with severe COVID-19 (Fig. 1a) . The majority of participants (n = 214) had no evidence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA was positive/equivocal positive in n = 9 and n = 10 subjects, respectively, and combined IgG and IgA-positive/equivocal positive in three subjects. Altogether, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG prevalence was in the range of 1-2% and the self-perceived likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these individuals similar to the entire cohort. Our data on SARS-CoV-2 IgG is only partially representative for our university hospital, not fully representative for other clinics, and we do not know the source of infection in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive HCP. However, the gap between perceived risk and evidence for an infection is most likely a phenomenon in many health-care settings. Additionally, we have only limited information about the full validity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology tests for screening. In a setting with low COVID-19 prevalence, the use of the spike protein S1 to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG may be suboptimal, and testing for antibodies against, e.g., the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 could increase sensitivity. Interestingly, given the significant association between disease severity and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in our ELISA, we hypothesize that asymptomatic seroconversions could lead to numerous equivocal positive ELISA results (Fig. 1a) , which still may represent neutralizing activity [9] . Such data may be difficult to interpret in cross-sectional studies and our longitudinal study design combined with neutralization assays will be informative about the magnitude of ELISA result changes over time. Finally, a matter of debate remains whether serological tests can also inform about COVID-19-specific immunity. Preliminary studies in rhesus macaques suggest that reinfection does not occur after survival of COVID-19, supporting the notion of at least temporary immunity after primary infection [10] .",

This is in stark contrast to the relatively high rate of self-estimated SARS-CoV-2 infection probability of our hospital's frontline HCP and strikingly different from currently high infection rates in medical personnel from Italian regions [1] . Also, our data show that personal risk perception correlates to age and sex, which should be taken into account when advising hospital staff on protective measures against COVID-19. Regular anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing of health-care workers may aid in monitoring the pandemic, assessing the quality of immune responses, and directing resources to assure COVID-19 care in the long run.",
