The mortality rates in the investigated flocks ranged from 1 to 47%. Results showed that mixed infection represented 66.3% of the examined flocks. Mixed infectious bronchitis (IBV) and avian influenza (AI)-H9N2 viruses were the most common infection (41.7%). Lack of AI-H9N2 vaccination and high rates of mixed infections in which AI-H9N2 is involved indicate an early AI-H9N2 infection with a potential immunosuppressive effect that predisposes for other viral infections. High pathogenic AI-H5N1 and virulent Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) infections were also detected (26.7% and 8.1%, respectively). Interestingly, co-infection of AI-H9N2 with either AIV-H5N1 or vNDV rarely resulted in high mortality. Partial cell-mediated immunity against similar internal AI genes, as well as virus interference between AI and vNDV, could be an explanation for this. Highly prevalent IBV and AI-H9N2 were isolated and were molecularly characterized based on S1 gene hypervariable region 3 (HVR3) and hemagglutinin gene (HA) sequences, respectively. IBV strains were related to the variant group of IBV with multiple mutations in HVR3. Though AI-H9N2 viruses showed low rate of evolution in comparison to recent strains, few amino acid substitutions indicative of antibody selection pressure were observed in the HA gene. In conclusion, mixed viral infections, especially with IBV and AI-H9N2 viruses, are the predominant etiology of respiratory disease problems in broiler chickens in Egypt. Further investigations of the role of AI, IBV, and ND viruses' co-infections and interference in terms of altering the severity of clinical signs and lesions and/or generating novel reassortants within each virus are needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Respiratory disease outbreaks with variable mortality rates and different clinical manifestations have been increasing in Egyptian commercial chicken flocks during the last few years.

Also AI-H9N2 infection alone resulted in severe respiratory signs, tracheal caseation, and 20% mortality rate. These data highlight the pathogenicity of AI-H9N2 as previously reported (Nili and Asasi, 2002) . Mixed infections of AI-H9N2 with other respiratory pathogens (particularly IBV, Mycoplasma gallisep-ticum, and Escherichia coli) are thought to be responsible for severe clinical disease with subsequent high mortality (Nili and Asasi, 2003; Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008) . Though not analyzed in this study, the role of secondary agents as bacteria, and environmental factors in the AI-H9N2 pathogenesis, cannot be neglected. Interestingly, co-infection with AI-H5N1 and H9N2 infrequently resulted in very high mortality rates. The early exposure to H9N2 viruses possibly provoked cellmediated immunity against H5N1 due to their similar internal genes. Therefore, partial protection by what is called the \"protected window\" after H9N2 infection can mask the lethal infection of H5N1 that may go unnoticed while the virus is shed by infected birds. This is a potentially important problem for countries such as Egypt that use H5N1 vaccines and cull flocks only when clinical disease is evident (Khalenkov et al., 2009) . Although co-circulation of H5N1 and H9N2 has been suggested to limit the spread and the epizootiologic pattern of the infections for both subtypes , their co-circulation in susceptible host populations can increase the likelihood of generating novel reassortant viruses with public health implications (Guan et al., 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 435, "text": "(Nili and Asasi, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 656, "end": 678, "text": "(Nili and Asasi, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 679, "end": 710, "text": "Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1457, "text": "(Khalenkov et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1781, "text": "(Guan et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Low mortality rates in vNDV infected flocks may be the result of partial protection offered by previous vaccination with live lentogenic NDV vaccines (Hadipour et al., 2011; Munir et al., 2012) .
