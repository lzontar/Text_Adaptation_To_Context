            "text": "Heterogeneous population structure can have a profound effect on infectious disease dynamics, and is particularly important when investigating \"tactical\" disease control questions. At times, the nature of the network involved in the transmission of the pathogen (bacteria, virus, macro-parasite, etc.) appears to be clear; however, the nature of the network involved is dependent on the scale (e.g. withinhost, between-host, or between-population), the nature of the contact, which ranges from the highly specific (e.g. sexual acts or needle sharing at the person-to-person level) to almost completely non-specific (e.g. aerosol transmission, often over long distances as can occur with the highly infectious livestock pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus-FMDv-at the farm-to-farm level, e.g. Schley et al. in J. R. Soc. Interface 6:455-462, 2008), and the timescale of interest (e.g. at the scale of the individual, the typical infectious period of the host). Theoretical approaches to examining the implications of particular network structures on disease transmission have provided critical insight; however, a greater challenge is the integration of network approaches with data on real population structures. In this chapter, some concepts in disease modelling will be introduced, the relevance of selected network phenomena discussed, and then results from real data and their relationship to network analyses summarised. These include examinations of the patterns of air traffic and its relation to the spread of SARS in 2003 (Colizza et al. in ",

Though the original work [46] considered infectious states in greater generality, the most common version of this model makes the simplification of assuming a single exponentially distributed infectious stage, with all infected individuals being equally infectious. With this assumption, the system takes the form of a \"compartmental model\". Here there are a set of three ordinary differential equations to be integrated over time: (4.1)",

            "text": "In the system of equations (4.1), the compartments are: S the number of susceptible individuals, I the number of infected, and R the number of removed (usually considered to be recovered and immune, though other interpretations of this state are possible). The total population size N is fixed. The parameter \u03b2 is the rate per infected individual at which infections occur, while \u03b3 is the rate at which infected individuals are removed. Important principles that have guided mathematical epidemiology over the last century are apparent in this simple formulation. First, interest in the field has concentrated on the nonlinear interactions over time between a host population and a pathogen that exploits it. Second, individuals are treated as indistinguishable except for their disease state. Third, the nonlinear terms incorporate the \"mean-field\" assumption, where interactions between members of the population are considered to occur at random, with equal probability that any member will interact with any other element of the system. Finally, the model operates in continuous time and population-space. In contrast, under the network paradigm of disease spread, a population is a network (or \"graph\") of nodes (\"vertices\") representing epidemiological units at a relevant scale (e.g. individuals, towns, cities, farms or wildlife communities). Each node i is connected to other nodes by a number k i links (\"edges\"), this defining the degree of the node. The links usually represent potentially infectious contacts. For example, for sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, links may be sexual acts or sexual partners [32] , while for diseases transmitting within a hospital links may represent contacts occurring through room-and ward-sharing [53] . Multiple, simultaneous exposures to a pathogen are usually assumed to act independently; therefore, if a node is connected to two infected nodes each of which can infect with probabilityp, the probability of becoming infected is (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212p) 2 ), where in this case, all links have the same weight. In directed networks (e.g. where one individual can infect another but not necessarily vice versa), links are distinguished as being inor out-links, with nodes having in-and out-degrees. For infectious diseases, this is more likely to be appropriate for larger scale models, for example, where transmission may be related to the migration of individuals who do not return to their origin. In most epidemiologically relevant examples where network structure is important, k N , where k is the average node degree, and N the population size. Borrowing the concept from the simple ODE models, nodes typically possess one of a limited number of states (e.g. susceptible, infected or removed as in (4.1)). \"Meanfield\" models such as described by (4.1) are similar to maximally connected network models-i.e. where every individual in the population is connected to any other individual and k = k i = N \u2212 1 for all nodes i. Network models can in this sense be considered a generalisation of mean-field models. Both network models and ODE models differ from detailed simulations studies, by being abstractions for gaining insight into how heterogeneity in the contacts amongst individuals can contribute to disease spread and its control. However, mean-field and network models differ in terms of the philosophy behind their representations. Mean-field models often do have population structure, but this structure is imposed on the population, rather than being generated from individual properties. In the network perspective, each node only has information about a limited subset of neighbours. Links are generated from this \"local neighbourhood\" that defines the social network. Thus the network model displays corresponding \"emergent behaviour\" in a way that the Kermack-McKendrick model does not. An important question is the extent to which the pattern, or the population structure, and process, or temporally-dependent changes as highlighted in mean-field models, are important in determining how epidemics spread. That most work has previously concentrated on the dynamics amongst simplified compartments is at least partially because observational data on overall disease incidence, and detailed data describing the time course of individual infection states have historically been more available than meaningful population contact structure data, particularly for humans. One of the most detailed and successful models of disease transmission on structured human populations is the description of measles outbreaks in post-WWII Britain (e.g. [7, 28] ) which includes comprehensive measles incidence reports, but where location is only specified to the level of city or town. Contact structure is therefore highly abstract (though more recent work in this field has used gravity models to described the underlying demographic contacts between cities [72] ). The development of the field has also benefited from the rich literature of dynamical systems, and the development of analogous models in chemical kinetics, reflected in the early appellation of \"mass-action\" dynamics when referring to what is now commonly known as \"density dependent\" contact. 1 Nevertheless, many of the ideas explored in social network analyses have been pre-viously explored using other approaches, though the social network paradigm has often proved to be more natural, and provided new insights.",

When R 0 > 1, each person who becomes infected will infect on average more than one person, so the epidemic will spread (i.e. dI dt t=0 + > 0). While this definition is intuitive, conceptual problems immediately arise. For example, can one define a \"typical\" infected individual? At what stage of the infection process is the infected individual introduced? What if there are distinct subpopulations or population structures? Is R 0 then a meaningful concept? Considerable attention has been devoted to these questions (e.g. [31, 60, 66] ), in particular due to the generalisation to more complex population and infection structures via the next generation matrix formalism [15] . However, these definitions are meaningful only if meaningful sub-populations can be defined, allowing for an exponential growth phase in an epidemic.

Here, each individual has C(N) potential infectious contacts (infectious with probability \u03c4 ), and this is dependent on the total popula-tion N . 2 The region in the parameter space where R 0 < 1 then defines a globally stable disease-free state if dC/dN \u2265 0 (usually, d 2 C/dN 2 \u2264 0 but this is not required), and none of C(N), \u03b2 or \u03b3 are functions of I . In particular, if dC/dI > 0, d\u03b2/dI > 0, or d\u03b3 /dI > 0, global stability is lost. This can occur if, for example, removal of infected individuals requires the availability of limited resources, so that d\u03b3 /dI > 0 (e.g. foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001, see [30] ) or one may have dC/dI > 0 if, for example, contacts are increased by otherwise sedentary individuals attempting to flee an epidemic, as may have occurred during the Black Death in the fourteenth century Europe. Each infected individual has a probability S/N per contact of interacting with a susceptible individual. For density dependent contact, C(N) = N and the form of system (4.1) is obtained. For \"frequency dependent\" contact, C(N) = \u03ba, a constant. In this case, the rate that new infections appear is \u03c4 SI \u03ba/N, and R 0 = \u03c4 \u03ba/\u03b3 . A critical difference between the two cases is that, with density dependence, thinning of the total population reduces N and therefore the value of R 0 , while with frequency dependence the reduction in population density or size has no effect on R 0 . In frequency dependent models, the number of contacts (links) is independent of population size. However, they differ from network models in that the contact is made with a random individual in the population. Thus the two are only equivalent in the case of a dynamic network with links that switch to new partners at an infinite rate [57] . An important consequence of this is that any infected individual still has \u03ba outward potentially infectious contacts in a frequency dependent model, while in static network models with bi-directional links, at least one of them is \"used up\" because the node was infected along one of its existing links (see, for example, [14] ).",

Thus even for a disease with low probability of transmission and where the disease has been identified within a few generations of infection after its introduction, it would be difficult to identify and isolate subgroups of individuals who are at higher risk of becoming infected. Localisation is exemplified by spatial spread, such as found in lattice models, where nodes are positioned on a regular grid of locations, and neighbouring individuals are connected. Such lattice models/networks exhibit homogeneous contact but have much longer average path lengths and diameters than Poisson networks. Empirical measurements confirm that many real-world networks are characterised by greater localisation of connections-i.e. the tendency for links to occur with greater probability than average amongst subgroups of nodes, but have small average path lengths very similar to that of Poisson random networks. Motivated by social structures where most individuals belong to localised communities composed of work colleagues, neighbours or people sharing similar interests, but some individuals also have connections with individuals that belong to other localised communities (e.g. relatives living considerable distances away and thus likely to belong to distant social communities as well) and old acquaintances, Watts and Strogatz [71] proposed the famous \"small-world network\" (SWN) model, which uses a one-parameter model to interpolate between a regular lattice model and a Poisson network. Their model starts with a ring lattice with N nodes where each node is connected to an arbitrary fixed number K of its closest neighbours. Two types of SWNs have commonly been studied. In the original version, a random rewiring of all links is carried out with probability q. A variant with similar properties does not rewire, but adds long range links randomly, with probability q to generate the same number of long range links as in the original model ( Fig. 4.1 ). Both approaches produce on average qKN/2 \"long-range\" links (or more correctly, they connect nodes at random). As the latter approach simplifies some calculations but has the same key properties as the original model, it will be referred to 1 An example small-world network, with each node connected locally to its four nearest neighbours later in the chapter. For a broad range of q, the SWN generates average path lengths approaching those observed in Poisson random graphs, yet with much greater localisation. The smaller average path length driven by the limited number of longrange connections (shortcuts) makes the network more connected, with fewer edges needed to connect any two nodes. A smaller average path length also means a smaller number of infectious generations with a shorter epidemic time scale, and a lower threshold for a large epidemic. The critical idea put forward by this model is that a relatively few \"long-distance\" connections are important for the transmission and persistence of disease. This has long been established, for example, within the metapopulation paradigm developed in the 1960s [50] where occasional migration between habitat patches was invoked to explain the persistence of species that would otherwise go extinct-in the case of epidemiology, the metapopulation is the pathogen operating on the host (or communities of hosts), which represent the habitat patches, such as the cities and towns in the previously mentioned measles models [7, 28] . Where the model of Watts and Strogatz' differed, however, was showing in an elegantly simple model, and in a quantifiable way, how simple couplings defined only as a property of individuals could be weak, yet produce dramatic effects in communities.",

More generally, there are often subgroups or communities of individuals that are more likely to be associated with each other, and there is an extensive literature devoted to identifying network-based measures of community (for a review, see [12] ). One measure of localisation is the clustering coefficient which can be quantified as c = 3\u00b7triangles triples , where a triangle is defined by a set of three nodes X, Y and Z in a triplet, where X is connected to Y which is connected to Z, and X is also connected to Z. Clustering can be viewed as expressing the probability of two friends of any one individual being themselves friends of each other, and this is illustrated in the classic signature of the small world effect, which is the rapid decline in the average path length between nodes, when the clustering coefficient remains high [71] . This definition is not unique; for example, clustering can also be computed by averaging the clustering coefficients of individual nodes c i = E i k i (k i \u22121)/2 , which represents the ratio between the number of links E i present amongst the neighbours of node and the possible maximum number of such links. For any meaningful definition, in networks approximating the structure of Poisson random networks have small inherent clustering, and in the limit of infinite populations, zero. Clustered networks can be generated by randomly distributing individuals/nodes in a given n-dimensional space (e.g. a specified two-dimensional surface) and assuming that the probability of a connection between two individuals is a function of their distance. By choosing an appropriate function, the average degree and clustering can be varied. Of course, clustering alone does not uniquely define a network; for example, an infinite number of networks can be generated with zero clustering.",

The closure at the triplet level (i.e. ignoring loops incorporating four or more nodes) is a compromise between incorporating contact heterogeneity and retaining analytical tractability, and it has been successful in accounting for correlations that form due to diseases spreading amongst clusters of connected individuals. An important feature of even moderate levels of clustering is the rapid decrease in the average number of new infections produced by each infectious individual. Largely due to the depletion of the susceptible neighbourhood; past the first generation, infected nodes often have at least one neighbour that is already infected. In networks clustered in two dimensions, there is a corresponding spatial localisation of epidemics ( Fig. 4 .2). While moment closure can provide a good approximation to the time course of stochastic simulations on clustered networks [42] , as always such good agreement depends on the underlying model being considered. Based on a model using Poisson-random networks with contact tracing and a delay before infectiousness [47] , Fig. 4 .2 shows how, even with no \"forced\" clustering (i.e. clustering only occurs due to population size effects), there is poor agreement between simulations and the analytic approximation, and this difference quickly becomes pronounced as clustering increases. While the sources of the discrepancy are not entirely clear, the delay in the onset of infectiousness and the addition of contact tracing add considerably to the complexity of the system being studied, highlighting the need for further research into analytical models of this type of contact heterogeneity. Despite these difficulties, as a strategic tool, moment closure equations allow us to explore the relationship between clustering and epidemic spread [42] , showing how clustering can lead to a dramatic reduction in the value of R 0 if generations of infection overlap with equivalent effects on the probability of successful disease invasion. Using additional equations incorporating links between nodes along which tracing takes place, the moment closure approach can also be used to explore the effect of network dependent disease control, such as contact tracing, i.e. identifying potentially infectious connections from infected individuals (e.g. [17, 34, 47] ). On a practical level, moment closure approaches have been used to explore the consequences of exploiting spatial proximity in the case of the Great Britain 2001 footand-mouth disease epidemic [21] .",

Assume that the probability of transmission of an STI to an individual depends only on the number of potentially infectious contacts per individual and the probability of transmission per contact. Then the population can be divided into distinct groups, with each group defined solely by the number of contacts. The number of individuals with k contacts is N k (k = 1, . . . , n).

Although random graphs have been extensively used as models of real-world networks, particularly in epidemiology, they can have serious shortcomings when compared to empirical data characterising social structures such as networks of friendship within various communities, as well as structures in physical and biological systems, including food webs, neural networks and metabolic pathways. With surprising frequency, the empirically measured degree distribution has significantly higher variance-to-mean ratio compared to a Poisson distribution. Examples include the World Wide Web, the Internet, ecological food webs, protein-protein interactions at the cellular level (e.g. [25] ), and most relevant for this discussion, human sexual networks, all with degree distributions reasonably approximated as scale-free, i.e. p(k) \u2248 k \u2212\u03b3 with 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3, over several orders of magnitude (but see also [38] ).

While the empirically determined distribution of sexual contacts is more precisely fit with a truncated scale-free distribution [38] , in the limiting approximation of a scale-free infinite population with no truncation, R 0 \u2192 \u221e since k 2 / k \u2192 \u221e even though k is finite. It follows that even an arbitrarily small transmission rate \u03b2 can sustain an epidemic [58] . As implied by the name \"scalefree\", random removal of nodes does not reduce the variance. Therefore, no amount of randomly applied, incomplete control (i.e. vaccination, quarantine) can prevent an epidemic. However, this is not the case for finite populations where the threshold behaviour is recovered [52] , and targeting the small pool of highly connected nodes is sufficient to prevent an epidemic, so long as these individuals can be identified and treated or removed. Further, even in the absence of control, the supply of highly connected nodes is quickly depleted, resulting in rapid disease extinction. Barth\u00e9lemy et al. [6] showed that a further consequence of high variance distributions is the non-uniform spread of the epidemic. The higher probability that any node will be connected to a highly connected node means that disease spread follows a hierarchical order, with the highly connected nodes becoming infected first, and the epidemic thereafter cascading towards groups of nodes with smaller degree (Fig. 4.3 and [48] ).",

The concurrency of links is well-studied [16, 18, 23, 55, 70] in the modelling of STIs, where the nature of the partnerships between individuals is emphasised, rather than the individuals themselves. This dyad-based approach often assumes that epidemic dynamics are driven by serially monogamous relationships [16, 55] .

An example of an ergodic, dynamic network is one where the network evolution is a Markov chain, and all states are accessible from the initial state. This is considerably less restrictive than other explorations of network dynamics, where the number of links for each node is assumed fixed (e.g. [57, 68] ). Here, the static network is generated by assigning to each node an infectious period drawn from an exponential distribution with mean period \u03c4 inc .

Because the removal and replacement of a link \"frees\" up the link from already connecting two infected nodes, epidemic dynamics would be expected to be different on the static and dynamic networks (Fig. 4.6 ). Early on, it is more likely that a \"used\" up link will be replaced by a \"free\" link, whereas the opposite would become true later in the epidemic, as more nodes are infected. Here, link dynamics are represented by a switching rate that defines an effective infectious period over a given link. Construction of a transmission network where every node has the same infectious period distribution is equivalent to a bond percolation model [65] . The static representation allows us to quantify these differences, by considering the effective infectious period of a node, with respect to a dynamic random link. Assuming SIR infection dynamics with exponentially distributed periods, the average infectious period is \u03c4 inc = 1/r inc and for transmission over the random links, the average effective infectious period must be modified by the switching rate, and therefore \u03c4 eff = 1/(r inc + r switch ). The relative probability of infection over random links is given by e \u2212\u03b2\u03c4 eff /e \u2212\u03b2\u03c4 fixed . To correct an effective transmission rate \u03c4 eff must ",

This is often the only logical approach if, for instance, no disease data are available, or if the properties of the underlying social network are being exploited for disease control. For example, for the purposes of analysing the efficacy of tracing of potentially infectious contacts for disease control, understanding the social network is vital [17, 34, 47] . However, in the absence of control, or when control is not based on exploiting social network structure, given a contact network and the characteristics of a disease that can spread on the network, one can thin links to generate the network of truly infectious links (as disease will not necessarily spread across all available links), referred to as the \"transmission\" network. Such a network is inherently directed (since one must consider separately the probability of infection in each direction) even when the social network is undirected; however, the thinned network is usually significantly more sparse. Further, while the social network may have weights attached to links and nodes, the transmission network is unweighted so long as the infectious state of any node is not dependent on any network parameters (e.g. one cannot have a node that is more infectious if it has been infected by exposure to multiple infected neighbours). It is also often the case that networks generated with different disease assumptions will have different properties to the underlying social network. For example, following Trapman [65] , consider two systems in which both have a constant infectiousness per link per unit time \u03c4 (t), but with either fixed infectious periods \u03b8 A (system A), or bimodal infectious periods, with a proportion 1 \u2212 X with a zero infectious period, and proportion X with an infectious period of length \u03b8 B (system B), such thatp",

This is illustrated in the case of the small-world network for which both the bond and site percolation threshold problems have been solved [54] . In the absence of long range connections, increases in the transmission probability per link will result in the growth of local clusters in the transmission network that would correspond to the local epidemic size, should an element in that cluster become infected. In the simplest case of a one-dimensional small-world lattice (i.e. with all nodes having local connections to exactly two neighbours), the probability p C that a local cluster of infected individuals will be of size C depends in a straightforward fashion on the probabilityp that a given link is infectious, if one assumes that, during the initial spread of the disease, the probability of a long range link returning to an already infected cluster is small. Then in this case, p C = (1 \u2212p) 2pC\u22121 , since the two end links must be non-infectious and all others C \u2212 1 links in the cluster must be infectious. Moore and Newman [54] use the expression for the local cluster size to determine the percolation threshold via a direct calculation based on the number and size of clusters connected together by long range shortcuts. Another, related approach is to construct a directed transmission network and contract all nodes in connected components joined by only local links into a single \"supernode\". The probability that there will be a supernode of size C in the (now directed) transmission network is p C = C(1 \u2212p) 2pC\u22121 ; e.g. for a cluster of size C = 3, with three consecutive nodes X, Y and Z, one could have a cluster of size C with X \u2192 Y \u2192 Z, X \u2190 Y \u2192 Z or X \u2190 Y \u2190 Z. Each supernode will have an average ofpqC infectious long range connections if the probability of a node having a long range connection in the original network was q. For a sufficiently large population, with all clusters contracted into supernodes, the resultant network of supernodes is randomly connected, and so (4.16), while not equal to R 0 , is the epidemic percolation threshold of the network, and therefore what one might call R SN 0 (i.e. for the system of supernodes) reduces to",

Whether or not such phenomena have a bearing on the transmission of real diseases over real networks is dependent on the interaction between the disease transmission characteristics and the underlying pattern of contact. A rule of thumb for the appropriateness of social network approaches is through a comparison of the relative timescale and distance of the activity of the host, compared to the transmission range and duration of infectiousness of the pathogen, which defines the scale over which social network-based approaches are useful. In the case of sexually transmitted diseases, transmission occurs over a very short range, specific action. In the case of SARS, at the worldwide scale, the airline transport network occurs over a much greater range than person-to-person disease transmission-equivalently, the action of the person has longer range than the action of the virus, and this is a similar case to the spread of pandemic influenza. In the case of livestock infectious diseases, the long range movement of livestock is greater than the local airborne spread of the pathogen.",

The airline interaction network in SARS has been extensively studied [9, 35] and some key elements are described here. The model formulation is similar to that of the measles metapopulation models [7] ; however, the SARS/airline network models are able to utilise the extensive data regarding the potentially infectious social contacts, rather than inferring them from the disease reporting numbers. The populations are reported as V = 3,880 vertices (major airports) joined by E = 18,810 weighted edges. These data are supplemented by the urban population data associated with these nodes (the human populations serviced by them) and, in the case of the later paper, the full disease outbreak data by reporting location.

[8] are discussed, which extend this using a Langevin equation formulation (originally to describe Brownian motion), based on stochastic SIR models with density dependence, discretized for numerical simulation. The approach results in a system of almost 10,000 differential equations where there are variables associated with 3,100 major centres with large airports, and three differential equations per centre. Demographic parameters are well-described by the airline network data, allowing for an analysis of the effects of well-described demographic stochasticity on epidemic occurrence. Of interest is the issue of repeatability-how often is a single set of events replicated, given an initial starting point for disease introduction? This has several implications: first, it impinges upon the usefulness of modelling exercises to predict, at a tactical level, how to target epidemic control. Second, comparison of simulation repeatability to a single simulation output (where the model structure is identical to that of the data) to repeatability in replicating a real epidemic is an indicator that, even if a model is a \"poor\" fit, it may, nevertheless, be a \"good\" model from the model selection point-of-view. Colizza et al. identify the \"Hellinger\" affinity sim( \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 I , \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 II ) = j \u03c0 I j \u03c0 II j measure of repeatability, where \u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 l (t) is the vector whose j th component represents the probability that an active individual (i.e. carrying infection) is in city j at time t. As the measure is scale invariant, it is only a measure of the epidemic pattern; therefore, a comparison of the overall prevalence between any two iterations I and II must also be included as an additional term, sim( \u2212 \u2192 a I , \u2212 \u2192 a II ) = j a I j (1 \u2212 a I j ), resulting in an overall measure",

Compartments are also treated generically, with the same structure and parameters for all regions despite the likelihood of epidemiologically important differences in the way people behave around the world. Thus the within-centre model remains highly abstract, and there is no consideration of the balance in detail accorded the disease model and the network model complexity. Is the detail of the transport network necessary for understanding the level of stochasticity and outputs generated? These simplifications imply that direct interpretation of model parameters must be treated with caution; scientifically this relatively parsimonious approach is appropriate if the intention is to concentrate on the relationship between air transport contact heterogeneity and disease transmission. The availability of epidemiological data is critical for getting this balance right. Optimisation is relatively unsophisticated, using a least squares approach to optimise the Hong Kong data (in the paper, they do not seek to optimise the Hellinger measure of (4.18)). Despite these issues, the integration of more explicit disease dynamics at a lower population scale, with the explicit demographic interaction is a welcome consideration, and the approaches used in this analysis have the potential to be broadly applicable across other disease systems, and would provide useful insights. Here, the critical result of the model is that it is a good predictor of regions that did have meaningful numbers of cases, with the majority of these being directly related to the activity originating from Hong Kong. The most telling indicator of the role of network heterogeneity and the interaction between the network model and within-node dynamics is the risk to Spain, which is mainly due to secondary connections from other European countries (UK, France, and Germany) rather than direct links from Hong Kong.",

            "text": "The movement of livestock in Great Britain is exceptionally well recorded, with detailed informing concerning the movement of large livestock between agricultural premises in Great Britain. Such data, recorded on a day-to-day basis, is an exceptional record of a dynamic disease-relevant network for which there exists disease data on which to test our concepts of social networks in epidemiology. These livestock networks have been extensively analysed, and have been shown to exhibit both small world and scale-free properties [41, 48] . Particularly well described is the movement of cattle, as individual animal movements are recorded, largely due to concerns over the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the 1990s. Bovine Tuberculosis (BTB) is a zoonotic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the tuberculosis clonal complex and an important cause of tuberculosis in humans, though less importantly in developed countries due to milk pasteurisation. It has been an endemic disease in British cattle for centuries which, however, was largely eliminated from most herds with the introduction of a widespread testand-slaughter programme in the first half of the twentieth century. However, BTB incidence in cattle has been steadily on the rise for the last four decades, with the estimated cost of control reaching \u00a390 million in 2005 and including \u00a335 million in compensation to farmers. Disease spread at the national level is likely due to both cattle movements [24] and other factors, most controversially transmission from infected badgers in high-risk areas. As BTB in cattle is a notifiable disease, all cattle testing positive for BTB are recorded centrally, with regular tests of all herds occurring every one, two, three or four years, depending on the perceived risk of transmission to cattle. This combination of long term disease plus demographic data allows for an exceptional opportunity to identify the role of detailed network structure in the transmission of disease. In Green et al. [27] , a livestock network is constructed probabilistically so that each premises i maintains a probability of infection through the simulation, P i , updated using one-day time-steps. Each potential infection event causes infection with probability p. This causes an increase in P i , conditional on the probability of i already being infected, such that P i \u2192 P i + \u0394P , where \u0394P = (1 \u2212 P i )p. The summation of \u0394P across all infection events gives the expectation of the total number of infections produced during the simulation, I , and it may be partitioned into the causes of infection listed below: total infections due to livestock movements (M), infections within high-risk areas (G) and background rate, countrywide (B). The expected prevalence at a given time is given by i P i , according to the following criteria:",

Maximum likelihood estimates were initially determined using the Nelder-Mead algorithm [56] , and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [29] was then used to explore parameter space around the best-fit parameters through a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation (MCMC). The model showed that the outbreak data are best explained by a model attributing roughly 16% of observed breakdowns to recorded cattle movements, and with only low levels of cattle-to-cattle transmission. High risk areas by circles surrounding BTB breakdowns were found to be better predictors of future risk of BTB breakdowns than officially designated high risk parishes, with predictions based on these unidentified high-risk herds being also responsible for an estimated 47 breakdowns through movements of infected cattle. The results also suggest that eliminating transmission associated with high-risk areas would reduce the number of BTB breakdowns by 75% in the first year alone. Of particular relevance here is the identification of cattle life histories as a better indicator of the role of network spread, than simply the connections between premises, emphasising the importance of accurate definition of the appropriate network structure.",

This provides a direct insight into the likely underlying network of transmission contacts. If the pathogen mutation rate per replication per base pair analysed is sufficiently high, then the genetic sequences from samples taken from infected individuals provides a signature indicating how closely related the virus population from different individuals are. Bayesian MCMC approaches are used to obtain the best fit transmission tree, using a measure such as the Hamming distance from information theory to identify the relatedness between individuals (i.e. how many genetic substitutions must be made to create identical sequences?). Standard phylogenetic fitting models assume that the rate of replication is not affected by density dependence considerations; however, the integration of epidemiological models can be used to correct this. While most current approaches are bespoke and require generalisation to be broadly applicable, theoretical foundations are being built to support the general development of these \"phylodynamic\" models [69] . Two excellent examples of the use of phylogenetics as tracers of the transmission network are the documentation of the clusters within the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease in GB in 2001. In both cases, a connection to network models is shown, and these data represent an exciting opportunity to validate the importance of putative social network connections for the transmission of infectious diseases, and an opportunity for social network analyses to inform our understanding of phylogenetic models.",

AIDS progressively compromises the immune system and leaves individuals vulnerable to opportunistic infections and tumors. Despite the development of increasingly effective drug therapies, in 2007, it was estimated that 33.2 million people lived with the disease worldwide, with AIDS and AIDS-related complications having killed an estimated 2.1 million people, including 330,000 children. Over three-quarters of all these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. The high rate of HIV evolution, combined with the availability of a very high density sample of viral sequences from routine clinical care in GB creates a system highly amenable to using phylodynamic approaches. Hughes et al. [36] studied extensive viral sequences from 11,071 heterosexual patients infected with HIV. Of these, 2774 were closely linked to at least one other sequence by nucleotide distance. Including the closest sequences, 296 individuals were identified to be in groups of three or more individuals in the UK. The analysis revealed that heterosexual HIV transmission in the UK is clustered, but compared to transmission amongst MSM (men who have sex with men) groups, are on average in smaller groups and with slower transmission dynamics. Despite the reduced clustering compared to MSM, highly heterogeneous contact rates were indicated, consistent with heavytailed distributions indicated in previous studies [37, 51] . Using molecular clock estimates, temporal patterns could also be analysed, rather than just social ones, which is crucial when relationship concurrency (i.e. network dynamics) is important [70] . The analysis of these data revealed extremely long intergenerational periods (27 months), almost twice as long as for MSM. This long generational time makes contact tracing (and thus direct identification of the social contact network) difficult. However, the relationship between the identified clusters and the known heavy-tailed distributions from epidemiological studies (Fig. 4.10 ) would suggest that, while a snapshot of the direct contact network would not identify truly at risk individuals, the overall pattern is consistent with the dynamic, evolving network over which HIV is transmitted.",

However, this does not allow for direct inference into the nature of such missing links. Indeed, such approaches on their own, cannot distinguish between sequential events that occur at different scales. For example, if a sequence AAA is taken from individual X, a sequence ABA from individual Y and ABC from individual Z, this implies that X and Y are more closely related by the Hamming distance measure, but it is not known, for example, if all the mutations occurred in X and therefore whether or not Z is a descendant of Y, or they are \"siblings\".

Endemic in large parts of Africa, South America and Asia, both Western Europe and North America are FMD free, and derive considerable economic benefit from this status. FMD was introduced into GB in 2001, and the resulting epidemic cost well over \u00a35 billion to control, with the loss of over 3 million livestock [30] . In 2007, FMD was again introduced into GB, this time via an escaped strain derived from virus held either the World Reference Laboratory in Pirbright, or the adjacent Meriel vaccine production facility; while considerably less extensive, nevertheless, the epidemic caused widespread disruption of the livestock industry at the national level, and cost almost \u00a3100 million to control [11] . Both the 2001 and 2007 footand-mouth disease epidemics are exceptionally well described, with detailed demographic and epidemiological information, including virus samples from across the entire epidemic. It is therefore an exceptional model system for understanding and developing phylodynamic principles [33] . FMD virus is an RNA virus with an exceptionally high mutation rate, sufficient so that discrimination of mutations down to the individual-to-individual level is possible. Preliminary studies into the phylodynamics of the 2001 epidemic have used a combined likelihood function that incorporates both Hamming distance measures and the spatio-temporal dynamics models used in previous studies. In this case, the likelihood function is fixed by epidemiological parameters. The most likely date of infection for each farm was estimated to be the date on which disease was reported on the farm, minus the age of the oldest lesion on the farm as estimated by veterinary investigation, less five days for the maximum within-host incubation period. There is uncertainty around the most likely date of infection, due to errors in the lesion dating, and possible variation in the incubation period by I i (t), and the possibility of missed, infected livestock. Given the estimated most likely date of infection of farm i, the most likely infection date of the first on-farm infection, and the examination date of the farm, allowing for a two day incubation period, determined the very latest possible infection time. The probability that a farm i was infectious at time F i (t) is then given in terms of I i (t) and the incubation period distribution L(k) (where k is the incubation period ",

            "text": "There is a rich interplay between two recent, but now mature, subject areas: disease dynamics and social network analysis. While the history of mathematical epidemiology contains many of the ideas that have since been replicated in social network theory, nevertheless, the study of social networks has generated both new ideas and new impetus to understanding the role that contact heterogeneity can play in the spread, persistence and control of infectious diseases. This interplay offers new ideas that are applicable to many other fields where heterogeneous structure is important. Apologies are offered to the authors of many valuable and interesting papers originating from both traditions that have been omitted. Of particular note amongst the omissions are the numerous recent epidemiological analyses that consider complex population structure and its impact on the H1N1 influenza pandemic starting in 2009 (e.g. [3, 10, 22] ). While many of these analyses are of epidemiological interest, the models are fundamentally similar to those discussed here in the context of SARS. In general, rather than presenting an exhaustive study of the results from either, illustrations have been presented of how it is only by considering a combination of both pattern and process can disease dynamics be properly understood. Critical to this is the interplay of individuals from both traditions, who will bring together the analytical strengths and insights they both have to offer (e.g. [5] ). Of growing interest is the increasing use of molecular epidemiology as a tracing tool, which brings both new opportunities and new challenges, as a coherent, rigorous framework for dealing with phylogenetics, disease dynamics, high dimensional statistical inference and network structure is yet to be established. This will undoubtedly be a major subject of interest over the next decade, and this is the central problem in the growing field of phylodynamics [33] .",

The best fit model attributes roughly 16% of spread to the movement of cattle, 9% of spread to unknown causes, and 75% of BTB spread to being present in high risk areas, where these areas are defined as 6 km radial disks surrounding breakdowns in the previous year. The movement of cattle that have previously passed through high risk areas is a better predictor than the full network of movements (i.e. allowing for secondary infection outside of high risk areas), indicating that networks must be carefully chosen.From Green et al., Proc.
