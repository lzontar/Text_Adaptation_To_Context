Research were terminated, vaccines are out of date, and new ones are neither developed nor investigated. 5 . The old vaccine is not suitable for people, suffering from immuno-deficient diseases, and number of such persons for the last 20 years has grown considerably. Besides, it is unlikely that terrorists would use wild strains of smallpox. It's more probable they would choose genetically modified variants with much stronger harmful action, in the absence of effective immune response. 6 . It is known that virus of monkey pox can be transferred from animal to human being and cause disease similar to mild case of natural smallpox, but it can pass from human to human by air as well. It was confirmed by outbreak in Zaire in 1996, when about 800 persons were ill.

All of these children consumed macaroni contaminated with mycotoxins [17] . There are known cases of using the biological weapon in Cambodia, Laos and Afghanistan (so called \"yellow rain\"), active components of which were, probably, mycotoxins.",
