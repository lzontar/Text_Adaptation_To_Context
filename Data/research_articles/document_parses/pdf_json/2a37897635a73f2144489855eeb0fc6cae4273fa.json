With the arrival of COVID-19 in Scotland, it was very quickly realized that CHAS would no longer be able to deliver respite and end-of-life care to families, while meeting their needs and adhering to government social distancing advice. Physical bed capacity was reduced from 8 beds to 3 beds in each hospice allowing for physical distancing and reducing the potential for families to inadvertently mingle. At this time, families were not keen to leave the safety of their own homes, preferring to cope with existing care packages or on their own.

Kindness Calls also enabled staff to enquire about the families' circumstances such as how they are managing during the lockdown and what support they may require.

For everyone in CHAS, the first and foremost desire was to ensure the babies, children, young people, and their families were supported through this very challenging time. Due to this desire to respond to need and an overwhelming aspiration to support and nurture, one of the main activities of the management team was to keep track of initiatives started. CHAS wanted to ensure that there were robust processes in place to reduce the potential for person dependent or location dependent interventions happening. The senior leadership team viewed equity and parity of service delivery to be an essential and fundament aspect of the virtual hospice and not limited by geographic location of staff delivering services. Second, setting out our intention to measure outcomes has allowed us to gather feedback and data to support the on-going development of the virtual hospice.
