These data support the idea that CAPE can be useful as an agent to stop or inhibit coronavirus-induced fibrosis in the lungs. 16 Although propolis belongs to the safest natural remedies, on rare occasions, adverse effects of propolis or its constituents are to be expected, especially allergic reactions. Therefore, when used in prevention or treatment of COVID-19, hypersensitivity reactions should be taken into account. 8",
