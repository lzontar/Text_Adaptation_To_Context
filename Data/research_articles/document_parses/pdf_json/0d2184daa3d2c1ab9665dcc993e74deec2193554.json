Here, we isolated a strain of PEAV, named GDS04 that is identified by immunofluorescence and typical crown-shaped particles observed with electron microscopy. Genomic analysis reveals that PEAV GDS04 shares a close relationship with SADS-CoV and SeACoV. Furthermore, newborn piglets orally challenged with PEAV GDS04 developed typical clinical symptoms as watery diarrhoea in neonatal piglets. Viral RNA was detected in faeces and various tissues of the infected piglets.",

The cells were cultured continuously at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for cytopathic effect (CPE) observation. The plates were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and thawed twice around 4 day postinoculation (d.p.i). The cells and supernatant termed as \"passage 1 (P1)\" were harvested together. Samples collected at 0-hr postinoculation and 4 d.p.i. were tested by PEAV-specific RT-PCR as described previously (Gong et al., 2017) . The RT-PCR positive samples were used as seed stocks for the next passage and plaque purification. For virus plaque purification, supernatants from virus-infected cells were serially diluted and used to infect Vero cells in the maintenance medium for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 and then the maintenance medium was discarded, followed by overlaying 2 ml maintenance medium containing 1.25% Agarose LM GQT (TaKaRa, Dalian) to immobilize the virus. After 24 hr, cells were fixed and visualized with 2 ml maintenance medium containing 1.25% Agarose LM GQT and 0.01% Neutral red solution (Sigma, USA).

Furthermore, four piglets from group 2 as cohabitation controls also developed watery diarrhoea from 5 to 12 d.p.i. (Figure 4e ). Since PEAV GDS04 caused severe watery diarrhoea in newborn piglets, we also recorded the mortality of newborn piglets in each group. As shown in Figure 5 , in PEAV-inoculated groups, except that two piglets were necropsied at 7 d.p.i., all remaining 10 piglets died from 5 to 12 d.p.i. And the PEAV-inoculated piglets had 1, 1, 3 (+2 euthanized), 1, 1, 2, and 1 death (s) at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 d.p.i., respectively. In addition, 2/4 piglets from group 2 as cohabitation controls also died at 7 and 9 d.p.i. No piglets (6/6) died in control group except that two piglets were necropsied at 7 d.p.i. Taken together, these results suggest that PEAV GDS04 is highly pathogenic to the newborn piglets.",

As shown in Figure 6a , the PEAV RNA was detected by qRT-PCR in faecal swabs collected from orally inoculated piglets from 1 to 11 d.p.i., and peaked on 4 d.p.i. and kept up until 11 d.p.i. We also examined the faecal viral shedding in piglets from group 2 as cohabitation controls. PEAV RNA was detected in rectal samples collected from these piglets from 3 to 13 d.p.i. (Figure 6a) , indicating that these piglets may be infected by the PEAV-challenged piglets. No PEAV RNA was detected in the negative control piglets during the study. To examine the distribution of the PEAV virus in different tissues in PEAV-challenged piglets, two piglets from each group were necropsied at 7 d.p.i. As shown in Figure 6b , the PEAV RNA was detected in all collected samples of duodenums, jejunums, ileums, caecum, and colons. The virus was also detected in 2/2 hearts, 2/2 F I G U R E 2 Electron micrographs of PEAV-inoculated Vero cells. Crown-shaped spikes of PEAV are visible (arrows).

The scale bar represents 1, 0.2, or 0.5 nucleotide substitutions per site livers, 2/2 spleens, 2/2 kidneys, 2/2 stomachs, and 1/2 lungs, but no viral RNA was detected in blood. No PEAV RNA was detected in the tissue samples from the control piglets. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PEAV GDS04 strain could be widely distributed in different tissues, but mainly concentrated in the intestines of pig. ",

Genomic analysis shows that the isolate manifests close relationship with SADS-CoV and SeACoV apart from several unique genetic characteristics. Remarkably, inoculation of newborn piglets with PEAV GDS04 P12 by oral feeding reproduced clinical symptoms, including vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhoea with a mortality of 100% in neonatal piglets. Collectively, these findings suggest that PEAV GDS04 is highly virulent in piglets.",

The isolation and characterization would lay solid foundation for understanding this virus and the strain GDS04 can be further used for virological and serological assays, as well as vaccine development.",

The samples were washed twice by sterile 1\u00d7 PBS (pH 7.4) and dehydrated using increasing concentrations of acetone. The samples were then embedded in Araldit 520 resin and polymerized in oven at 90\u00b0C for 24 hr. Tissue semithin sections (1 \u03bcm) were prepared, stained by Toludin blue stain for 5 min and inspected under conventional light microscope. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were prepared using Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, collected on 200 mesh copper grid (PELCO) and stained with uranyl acetate for 15 min and lead citrate for 5 min. The ultrathin sections were screened by 120-kV JOEL1230 transmission electron (TEM)(Akishima, Japan) and images were obtained using side-mounted digital camera (Gatan 780AJ03FA, Pleasanton, CA, USA).",

As shown in Figure 1b, one inoculated cell monolayer with the supernatant from virus-infected cells of passage 10 (P10) showed visible CPE in the form of syncytium and detachment at 1 d.p.i. as compared with the control in Figure 1a. To confirm PEAV replication in Vero cells, viral RNA was extracted from the inoculated cells at 1 d.p.i. and tested by specific RT-PCR. This cell culture-passaged sample was positive for PEAV but negative for other porcine enteric coronaviruses (data not shown). PEAV from the first passage in Vero cells was named GDS04 (Gong et al., 2017).

Plaquepurified PEAV in Vero cells was further confirmed by IFA with PEAV-specific mouse antisera. As shown in Figure 1d, PEAV-specific immunofluorescence was detected in infected cells, as compared to the control (Figure 1c). To characterize the morphology and size of the virus particles, the PEAV GDS04 virus purified from infected Vero cells were examined with EM. Typical crown-shaped particles with spiky surface projections as in other coronaviruses were observed by negative staining on EM. The size of the viral particles was 80-160 nm in diameter (Figure 2).
