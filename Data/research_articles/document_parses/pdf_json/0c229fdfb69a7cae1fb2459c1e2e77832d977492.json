            "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of failure of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) after cardiac surgery in pediatric patients with respiratory failure after extubation and to identify predictive success factors. This was a prospective cohort study of pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital heart disease who underwent heart surgery and used NIV. Data were collected from 170 patients with a median age of 2 months. No patient presented cardiorespiratory arrest nor any other complication during the use of NIV. The success rate for the use of NIV was 61.8%. Subjects were divided for analysis into successful and failed NIV groups. Statistical analysis used Chi-square, Mann-Whitney, and Student's t tests, which were performed after univariate and multivariate logistic regression for p < 0.05. In the multivariate analysis, only the minimal pressure gradient (OR 1.45 with p = 0.007), maximum oxygen saturation (OR 0.88 with p = 0.011), and maximum fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) (OR 1.16 with p < 0.001) influenced NIV failure. The following variables did not present a statistical difference: extracorporeal circulation time (p = 0.669), pulmonary hypertension (p = 0.254), genetic syndrome (p = 0.342), RACHS-1 score (p = 0.097), age (p = 0.098), invasive mechanical ventilation duration (p = 0.186), and NIV duration (p = 0.804). In conclusion, NIV can be successfully used in children who, after cardiac surgery, develop respiratory failure in the 48 h following extubation. Although the use of higher pressure gradients and higher FiO 2 are associated with a greater failure rate for NIV use, it was found to be generally safe.",

These and other complications can lead to respiratory failure (RF) [1] [2] [3] , which is treated with invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) protects the airways against aspiration or obstruction, creates positive pressure ventilation, and provides optimal airway control, allowing diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. However, IMV exposes patients to important complications, due to causes such as the trauma caused by intubation and the presence of the endotracheal prosthesis, and the reduction of the natural defense mechanisms of the respiratory system, which may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia [1, 4] These complications associated with IMV increase the chance of extubation failure, which increase the mortality rate and increase hospital stay duration [4, 5] .",

As in the adult environment, the use of NIV in neonatology and pediatrics has been gaining acceptance [6, [8] [9] [10] . However, despite growing interest, few studies have been conducted on this topic. The indication of NIV for pediatrics in different clinical settings is controversial. Existing studies were either performed in single centers or with a small number of patients, or without taking into account the parameters used for mechanical ventilation (ventilatory variables), which are highly relevant for identifying factors prognostic of success or failure. Conventionally, acute RF in postoperative cardiac surgery children is treated with orotracheal reintubation and invasive ventilatory support [6] [7] [8] [9] 11] . The use of NIV in this population as an alternative ventilatory support is not well established, in contrast to studies in adults where its use is already consolidated [9, 10] .",

Reintubation was decided by team consensus using the absolute criteria cardiorespiratory arrest, hemodynamic instability, and lowering of consciousness level. Relative indications for reintubation were refractory hypoxemia, persistence of respiratory acidosis upon arterial gasometry examination, and clinical signs of respiratory fatigue. The following variables were considered as primary: reintubation, risk-adjusted classification for congenital heart surgery (RACHS-1) score, age, NIV duration, and duration of extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Secondary variables were gender, presence of genetic syndromes, pulmonary hypertension, type of congenital heart disease, surgery performed, inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO 2 ) used, maximum and minimum pressure gradient, maximum and minimum positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), type of ventilator, interface used, use of sedatives, complications, total time of IMV, and pre-existing respiratory diseases.

However, after adjustment for covariates in the multiple analysis (Table 4) , only a few ventilatory parameters had an influence on the occurrence of NIV failure: the minimum pressure gradient, the maximum SpO 2 , and the maximum FiO 2 . The analysis indicates that a higher minimum pressure gradient, maximal FiO 2 , and a lower SpO 2 were associated with reintubation. Table 3 shows the NIV results in relation to ventilatory parameters with univariate analysis, whereas Table 4 presents only the ventilatory parameters with p < 0.05 after multivariate analysis.",

In contrast, in our study, which had a larger number of participants (170 vs. 29), the median NIV durations were very similar between the success and failure groups (p = 0.804). However, the NIV durations were also much lower than those presented in the aforementioned article (48 h and 46 h for failure and success groups, respectively), despite similar success rates.

Other critical actions include watching for the presence of pulmonary secretions, to rapidly eliminate them; monitoring the level of awareness of the child and trying to calm the child or administer sedation in case of agitation or, in cases of lethargy, re-evaluating the therapy; and making the appropriate choices of interface and supply fan.

Initial studies were done with a variety of patients with respiratory failure. Recently, some authors, such as Hernandez [22] , in a study comparing the use of HFNC with NIV after extubation in patients at high risk of extubation failure, showed that NIV was not superior to HFNC in preventing reintubation. However, the definition of high risk of failure in that study was quite broad. Despite the promising results of the HFNC, this therapy costs more than NIV, which can be performed with the same ventilators that are already present in intensive care units. In developing countries, this cost factor is critical in choosing the therapeutic method to be used.",
