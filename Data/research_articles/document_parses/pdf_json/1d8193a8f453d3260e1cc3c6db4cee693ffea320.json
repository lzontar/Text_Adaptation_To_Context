To study this, we choose economic production networks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels-linkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors (mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical properties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral epidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and potentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to be immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the meso/macro-levels. We propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the mechanism of distress propagation, across different modules of a network, initiated at different epicenters. Vulnerable modules often lead to large degrees of destabilization. We demonstrate our methodology using a unique empirical data-set of input-output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one administrative state of India, a developing economy. The network has multiple hub-and-spoke structures that exhibits moderate disassortativity, which varies with the level of coarse-graining. The novelty lies in characterizing the production network at different levels of granularity or modularity, and finding 'too-big-to-fail' modules supersede 'too-central-to-fail' modules in distress propagation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "\"The current crisis is more complicated. It is not a financial crisis, but a real crisis affecting the supply and demand system. . . . If the supply chain is broken, an increase in demand will not solve the problem.\" -Joseph Stiglitz on coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath 1 [17th March, 2020] The coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic has brought the entire world to a standstill; a crisis of gigantic proportion and unprecedented. This could happen at a rapid pace and to such a great extent because of the extremely dense global connectivity in the human socio-technological world. A complex interdependent system is often 'robust yet fragile' 2 and its fragility with respect to external or internal perturbations may represent emergent phenomena. 3, 4 Both robustness and fragility of a complex system can originate from the network of interdependencies among the constituents and, the mechanism of distress propagation in turn, is known to be dependent on its topological properties, ranging from the node-level local characteristics to the network-level global characteristics. [5] [6] [7] On one extreme, the failure of a single individual node might cause a cascading failure in the whole network, e.g., power grid, traffic system, societal spreading of rumor/infection. 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] At the other extreme of systemic robustness with respect to localized external perturbations, we have economic networks, where the fluctuations and economic cycles of boom and bust are thought to be driven by aggregate shocks like monetary shocks, productivity fluctuations and so forth. 12 However, this traditional view of an economic crisis has been challenged in the aftermath of the recent financial downturn of 2007-09. In an important paper, Gabaix 13 showed theoretically and empirically that aggregate fluctuations in an economy could be driven by firm-level shocks. A complementary approach was proposed by Acemoglu et al. 14 where they showed that the phenomenon of shock propagation through sectoral linkages could impact aggregate volatility.

The idea of aggregate shocks 15 is quite appealing: if production clusters (say, firms or sectors) have uncorrelated disturbances, such disturbances would tend to average out as we disaggregate the economy into finer and finer levels of production, essentially due to the central limit theorem. This in turn, would imply that only aggregate shocks can have macroeconomic consequences. Indeed, the source of fluctuations in most of the business cycle literature can be traced back to aggregate supply side or demand side shocks. [16] [17] [18] In contrast, there is new literature that emphasizes the inter-linkages in the production structure of modern economies and how they might actually amplify rather than mute the idiosyncratic effects arising out of production units. 17 In this paper, we examine the role of network architecture (modularity) of a granular economy on the origin of a shock and how it percolates in an interdependent economy, which can be considered as an ideal example of a complex system. We combine features from both the approaches and show that clusters of firms (modules), which are closely connected through supply chains, can serve as a model for understanding the effects of shock or distress propagation. In particular, we study the architectures of the firm-to-firm production network at different levels of coarse-grained filters and the resultant shock propagation mechanisms.

In particular, the modular architecture of the network should be seen as the basic building block. Below we explain why and how it differs from the firm-level 13 and sector-level 14 granularity. First of all, we note that potential shocks might be local in nature affecting individual firms. A sector is a collection of firms that produces similar goods classified under the same type of production processes, which is more coarse-grained and granular than a firm. Firms on the other hand, might be made of production plants. Ideally, we should be able to trace the epicenter of a shock to the plant-level, which is literally the smallest production unit. However, such fine-grained data is extremely rare and largely not available. Here, we have utilized an unique administrative data-set obtained from the Indian state of West Bengal, which was generated by matching the tax-collection records of nearly 0.14 million firms while they carried out bilateral trades of purchasing and selling of manufactured goods. We have constructed the networks from the data collected in four quarters of the fiscal year 2016. The time-period considered is special as on 8th November 2016, the Indian government carried out demonetization, which entailed the existing currencies to be declared ineffective and not backed by the government. The goal was to reduce the extent of the shadow economy and the use of counterfeit cash. Since the Indian economy does not yet have a well-developed financial market and trades mostly depend on cash transactions, such a move can be expected to have an effect on bilateral trades between production units.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A summary of our main results is as follows:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "(i) Macroscopic properties of the production network are quite stable.

We have already noted before that the network of communities obtained from the Infomap algorithm is more coarse-grained than the one obtained from modularity maximization algorithm (see Fig. S2 ). Also, it is worthwhile to note from Table 3 that the network of communities obtained from the Infomap algorithm substantially less disassortative (very mildly assortative) than the one obtained from modularity maximization algorithm.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 799, "end": 806, "text": "Fig. S2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 846, "end": 853, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Distress propagation in empirical network of communities"}, {"text": "In Fig. 4 , we have plotted distress propagation on the network of communities constructed via modularity maximization algorithm in quarter 2 in the fiscal year 2016. Panel (a) shows the network of communities. We give a unit shock to the largest node (denoting the largest community) and record the response across all nodes over time, as shown in panel (b). We see that a large number of nodes respond after one to three periods and the peak response is about 20% of the original shock (the z-axis denotes the shock intensity; colorbar shown in the figure). We implement the same exercise on the same dataset where the network of communities has been constructed via Infomap algorithm. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . By nature of construction, modularity maximization recovers more granular network than Infomap consistently across all quarters. A notable difference from the earlier result (i.e. the network of communities based on modularity maximization) is that here the effects are much more heterogeneous; fewer number of nodes respond and the response intensity is also comparatively smaller in magnitude. Following an alternate approach, we studied distress diffusion on the networks of communities where the epicenter of the shocks are the nodes with highest eigenvector centrality. 7, 14, 31, 32 We have provided complementary analysis of these experiments with all quarters (quarter 1-4, 2016 fiscal year) data in Figs. S3-S4 (modularity maximization) and S5-S6 (Infomap) in the Supplementary information. Findings are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar.

In this paper, we leveraged on the unique administrative data-set obtained from the Indian state of West Bengal that allowed us to construct firm-to-firm buyer-seller network at the smallest level of granularity, by matching the tax records produced for each transaction by both parties of the transaction, i.e., the buying firm and the selling firm. Therefore, by matching the records we created a bilateral linkage between two firms and by collating all such linkages arising out of transactions within a given period of time (data had been collected every quarter in a fiscal year), we created the complete network of transactions across all the registered firms.

(iii) The nature of distress propagation was substantially different across the networks of communities, viewed at different levels of coarseness. In particular, the more disassortative, coarser networks gave rise to network-wide diffusion of shocks and the magnitude of the diffused shock was large; the more assortative, less granular network led to muted diffusion of shocks with a limited region of spread. Our simulation results on the empirical coarse-grained structures indicate that 'too-big-to-fail' nodes are more dominant than 'too-central-to-fail' nodes in terms of distress propagation, which is a significant result in the context of identifying the relative contribution of size vis-a-vis centrality to network fragility.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary and Discussion"}, {"text": "Our results complement the current literature on diffusion processes on complex networks.

Therefore, shocks emanating from one state, in principle, could be transmitted to the network we have studied via trading partners within West Bengal. This is amenable in our framework, where instead of individual communities, we would need to give shocks to a set of firms (affected by exogenous shocks) and simulate the shock diffusion processes. However, such data is currently not available to us. Furthermore, the computation over a country-wide firm-firm network (even without considering international linkages) would be immensely costly.

However, our data-set does not overlap with the GST regime. In the tax collection scheme, each firm had an unique identification number. Due to the tax collection structure, both the buyer and the seller parties of a transaction were supposed to produce a record of the transaction amounts-the nature of the transactions and amount of money exchanged, along with the identification number of the trading partner. Then records from both sides were matched to rule out false reports of trades. Therefore, a successful match between the buyer's record and a seller's record indicated successful completion of a trade between the buyer and the seller. In our database, a successful trade shows up as a linkage between two firms. The state officials collected and aggregated such data through tax filing in every quarter of the year. Therefore, one could construct a network arising out of all the reported binary linkages in a given quarter.
