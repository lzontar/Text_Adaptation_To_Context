Although not full assessed for HIV before these are well characterized mutants of IFITM3 and the addition to the knowledge of IFITM3 is marginal.

From the methods the impression is that only one BLAST hit for IFITM3 would be returned for each primate and is represented in Figure 4A . However, it is well known that the IFITM genes are highly pseudogenized in genomes and paralogous duplicate IFITM3s have been proposed. Therefore simple BLASTN and BLASTP analysis cannot distinguish the true IFITM3 from pseudogenes or paralogs, with the later being more interesting. The only reliable means to identify IFITM3 is to map it within the locus defined by IFITM1, 2 and 5 flanked by two genes B4GALNT4 and ATLH1. Therefore it is very likely that the authors are analyzing pseudogenes in Figure 4 .",

Figure 1 . Del21 appears smaller than full length but why is the Del-palm smaller? 2. Why does Del Y20 run significantly higher than WT IFITM3 (and del 21)( fig 1I) -where does delY20 localize -would assume plasma membrane as published but would be good to see. 3 .

            "text": "In this study, Compton et al. describe how the subcellular localisation of IFITM3 affects its antiviral restriction activity. They identify specific residues in the N-term domain that are critical for endosomal accumulation of IFITM3, pinpointing to phosphorylation of Y20 as the key element. The authors show that residues around Y20 are important for NEDD4 mediated ubiquitination of IFITM3, which regulates its abundance. Aberrant localisation of IFITM3 to the plasma membrane due to changes at or around Y20 results in greater incorporation of the protein into HIV-1 particles and greater restriction of infection, a phenotype maintained in CD4+ T cells. Conversely, less abundant IFITM3 mutants are less restrictive of HIV-1. Next, the authors examine IFITM3 sequences in several primate species and detect substitutions in the critical N-term domain. They test such IFITM3 variants and find that some of them are defective for ubiquitination or endosomal localization and this correlates with HIV-1 restriction. Interestingly, due to their localisation at the plasma membrane, IFITM3 variants with potent HIV-1 restriction have weak flu restriction. The authors speculate that divergent evolutionary pressures might have caused IFITM3 species-specific variations at the N-term region to counteract different viral infections. IFITM3 has recently been described as a novel, early-acting restriction factor so little is know about its mechanism of action. A polymorphism at the N-term of human IFITM3 was proposed to be a determinant of severe flu, suggesting that IFITM3 is actually important in vivo. This study provides important new information on the function of IFITM3 and hints at the possibility of species-specific evolution caused by viral infections. The study, however, does not address the actual mechanism of action of IFITM3, which remains rather elusive. Nonetheless the study is intriguing and well performed.",

We believe our results point exactly to what you are suggesting-that the repeated duplication and divergence of IFITM genes may add to the \u00ab antiviral coverage \u00bb for a given host species. This is an important point, and we have now added to the Abstract. We have included new data showing that some primate species encode multiple IFITM3 genes which, together, may allow for simultaneous restriction of viruses at different cell compartments (HIV and IAV, for example). We also highlight that IFITM2 is a recent genetic innovation present only in Humans, Chimps, and Gorillas. IFITM1 is present in a few additional species, but it is not ubiquitous. Furthermore, we include data showing that IFITM1 is not an efficient inhibitor of viruses entering late endosomes (Influenza). Thus, while IFITM2 and IFITM1 may provide balance to the antiviral coverage of human cells, this doesn't seem to be the case in other species. A surprising finding is that IFITM3 is the oldest antiviral IFITM family member and that it has proliferated to multiple copies in many different species. Indeed, we believe that this is likely the result of increasing the antiviral coverage of the cell, and it is analogous to the recent duplication of IFITM3 to form IFITM2 in human ancestors. These novel findings are now presented in the new Figures 3-5 and EV4-5.",

However, it is well known that the IFITM genes are highly pseudogenized in genomes and paralogous duplicate IFITM3s have been proposed. Therefore simple BLASTN and BLASTP analysis cannot distinguish the true IFITM3 from pseudogenes or paralogs, with the later being more interesting. The only reliable means to identify IFITM3 is to map it within the locus defined by IFITM1, 2 and 5 flanked by two genes B4GALNT4 and ATLH1.

Our sequence retrieval and presentation is not based on BLAST results, but rather comparative genomics using fully sequenced reference genomes from a panel of primate species. To address the reviewer's concerns about possible pseudogenes, we have excluded any sequence that is annotated as a pseudogene or any sequence that resembles a pseudogene in any way. Each sequence derived from the Ensembl database represents an open reading frame and is annotated as proteincoding. While this annotation is not strictly based on experimental evidence for protein production, the sequences do not exhibit characteristics used to define pseudogenes. For example, they do not encode premature stop codons and they retain a high level of sequence similarity to IFITM3 in humans. Furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis proved essential because it showed that certain \"non-canonical\" IFITM3 genes are conserved in multiple species, allowing us to date their origins and suggesting that they have been selectively maintained (results presented in the novel Figure 4 and Figure EV4 ). If these genes were pseudogenes by definition, genetic drift would lead to signs of decay in this signal, and by definition, gene inactivation would occur. Naturally, we cannot prove that each and every sequence here can give rise to protein. However, the sequences selected for in depth study exhibit a high degree of similarity to Human IFITM3 on the protein level. Finally, we have supplemented our genomic analysis to include IFITM3 orthologs in additional Strepsirrhine primates which allowed us to reveal the primitive state of the IFITM locus (Figures 3 and 4) . In these species, only IFITM3 and IFITM5 are found in the canonical locus (flanked by B4GALNT4 and ATLH1), and moreover, duplication in IFITM3 has led to two adjacent IFITM3 genes in this locus, with one copy exhibiting mutations in the NEDD4 and/or AP-2 binding sites. RNA-seq data from NCBI also show that these genes are expressed. Thus, the mutations we chose to analyze in functional experiments are identical to or similar to naturally occuring mutations identified in IFITM3 genes, whether they be located in the canonical IFITM locus or elsewhere in the genome. We hope that this combined set of novel analyses addresses the important question raised by the reviewer.",

Additionally, we believe that deviations between a gene tree and a species tree are not problematic, but rather interesting, as they indicate selective forces have likely been at play.",

They identify specific residues in the N-term domain that are critical for endosomal accumulation of IFITM3, pinpointing to phosphorylation of Y20 as the key element. The authors show that residues around Y20 are important for NEDD4 mediated ubiquitination of IFITM3, which regulates its abundance. Aberrant localisation of IFITM3 to the plasma membrane due to changes at or around Y20 results in greater incorporation of the protein into HIV-1 particles and greater restriction of infection, a phenotype maintained in CD4+ T cells. Conversely, less abundant IFITM3 mutants are less restrictive of HIV-1. Next, the authors examine IFITM3 sequences in several primate species and detect substitutions in the critical N-term domain. They test such IFITM3 variants and find that some of them are defective for ubiquitination or endosomal localization and this correlates with HIV-1 restriction. Interestingly, due to their localisation at the plasma membrane, IFITM3 variants with potent HIV-1 restriction have weak flu restriction. The authors speculate that divergent evolutionary pressures might have caused IFITM3 species-specific variations at the N-term region to counteract different viral infections.",

This study provides important new information on the function of IFITM3 and hints at the possibility of species-specific evolution caused by viral infections.

Unfortunately, the ubiquitinated forms of IFITM3 are not detectable by the anti-FLAG antibody. This is because 1) the FLAG detection requires an anti-mouse secondary antibody, which interacts strongly with the light and heavy chains of the antibody-coupled beads used to perform immunoprecipitations, preventing the detection of ubiquitinated forms in the same area of the membrane and 2) the FLAG antibody has lower affinity than the IFITM3-specific antibody. Thus, the IFITM3-specific antibody, produced in rabbit, proved to be more useful to this end. The relatively smaller panel with the FLAG antibody is still shown because it shows comparable immunoprecipitation was achieved using FLAG-coupled beads. The Figure 5 is nonetheless clearer and more concise, and former Fig 5D  ( showing stable expression levels in 293T cell lines) has now been moved to Fig EV5. Referee #2:",

The former Figures 1, 2, 3 and 5 have been simplified and reassembled as Figures 1 and 2. We have performed an extensive analysis of the evolution of IFITM genes in primate species and their function, with novel findings that are presented in the new Figures 3, 4 and 5. These new figures allowed us to address in detail the referees' concerns (in particular referee 1#, third point and referee #2, regarding pseudogenes). The manuscript is now more balanced, with a better emphasis of the novel results about IFITM3 evolution in primates and consequences on antiviral properties of this family of proteins. Referee #1: Compton and colleagues have investigated the antiviral role of the predicted truncation that occurs in the rs12252-C polymorphism of IFITM3. This results in the that removal a YxxPhi AP-2 binding endocytosis motif and an overlapping PPxY binding site for HECT Ub ligases. They find that overexpression of this variant increases antiviral activity against HIV-1 in transient expression/induced expression systems and there is and additive affect of truncating the ligase binding site and the endocytosis motif. Interestingly mutations in these sites are present in primate sequences and vary restrictive potency against HIV and flu.The MS is clearly presented. However, in my opinion is falls short of the general interest required for EMBO.",
