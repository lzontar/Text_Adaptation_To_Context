Achieving containment demands accurate and timely collection of the infected individual's location and contact history. Traditionally, this process is labor intensive, susceptible to memory errors, and fraught with privacy concerns. With the recent almost ubiquitous availability of smart-phones, many people carry a tool which can be utilized to quickly identify an infected individual's contacts during an epidemic, such as the current 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID- 19) crisis. Unfortunately, the very same first-generation contacttracing tools can also be -and have been -used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most private details about individuals.",

Finally, we express our belief that citizen-centric, privacyfirst solutions that are open source, secure, and decentralized (such as MIT Private Kit: Safe Paths) represent the nextgeneration of tools for disease containment in an epidemic or a pandemic. With this paper, our aim is to continue to grow the conversation regarding contact-tracing for epidemic and pandemic containment and discuss opportunities to advance this space.

However, 'lock down' like containment can also disrupt the productivity of the population, distort the markets (limiting transportation and exchange of goods), and introduce fear and social isolation for those that are not yet infected or that have recovered from an infection. Finally, and most importantly, contact tracing can be quickly deployed at the first warnings of an outbreak, but continues to be effective when disease resurgence concerns exist. Thus, following an initial epidemic peak, contacttracing can be an effective means to enable disease decline and avoid multiple peak periods and disease resurgence.",

This is specifically related to the R0 (R naught) that determines how contagious an infectious disease is. R0 is a description of the average number of people who will catch a disease from one contagious person. Ideally, a lower number will optimize reduction of disease spread, which will facilitate time to develop a vaccine or for the disease to die out. Three factors that define R0 are the infectious period (which is generally fixed for a given disease), the contact rate (i.e., how many people come in contact with a contagious person), and the mode of transmission (which is similarly fixed for a given disease). Thus, for a given disease, the most adjustable factor is the contact rate.",

Understanding if paths have been crossed between an infected individual and any number of other individuals will allow for identifying those who have been exposed (and maybe should be tested resulting in appropriate resource allocation or may isolate themselves in the absence of available testing). Thus, at a societal level, this may limit the economic and public impact.",

For example, if we assume uptake of an application amongst x% of a population, and assuming that portion of the population responds to known exposure by self-quarantining or pursuing texting to confirm lack of infection, the R0 will decrease in turn by a multiple of that percentage based on the degree of mixing in the population. The reason for the multiple decrease is R0 partially depends on the population size and density and the exact number of people an individual may come in contact with after exposure which varies amongst individuals. Furthermore, with an increasing number \"x\" in terms of user base, there will be an exponential decrease in R0 (e.g., for 100% use and appropriate action, R0 would be expected to fall <1 due to maximal reduction of contact rate). Thus, for example, a 10% uptake will have downstream impacts on individuals that person may have come in contact by more rapid exposure/contact identification. This may eventually disrupt the contact rate with may significantly reduce the R0 more than is accounted for by the 10%.",

Limiting the publicly published data helps protect the known carrier's identity from the public. To date, with the exception of participatory sharing models, the diagnosed carrier's data must be shared with a third-party entity, requiring the carrier to relinquish at least some control over their data. Ending the need for third party involvement would represent an immense step forward in privacy protection for diagnosed carriers. Access and usage of the data by an entity, mostly governments, should be limited and highly regulated. Harsh penalties for the abuse of such data should be established. Obtaining true user consent further protects diagnosed carriers. Not all approaches in use today require consent to share personal data. Particularly in non-democratic regimes, diagnosed carriers may be unable to deny consent. In other instances, all users must consent to share their data in order to be informed of their own exposure risk. We believe no one should be obligated to share their personal information. Time limited storage of location trails further protects the privacy of diagnosed carriers.

            "text": "Private Kit: Safe Paths Private Kit: Safe Paths is an MIT-led, free, open-source and privacy-first contact-tracing technology that provides individual users information on their interaction with COVID-19, while also empowering governments' efforts to contain an epidemic outbreak. The solution is a 'pull' model where users can download encrypted location information about carriers so the users can self-determine their likely exposure to COVID-19 and coordinate their response with their doctor using their symptoms and personal health history.The Private Kit: Safe Paths solution, in its first iteration, enables individuals to log their own location. With consent they can provide health officials with an accurate location trail once they are diagnosed positive. Additionally, governments are equipped with a tool to redact location trails and thus broadcast location information with privacy protection for diagnosed carriers and local businesses. In its second iteration, Safe Paths provides users with information on whether they have crossed paths with a diagnosed carrier. Safe Paths' ability to do so without collecting information on the user in an external cloud prevents government surveillance. As an open-source tool, Safe Paths fosters public trust and utilizes experts to audit its security and privacy features.In the last phase of development, Private Kit: Safe Paths will move to a mix of participatory sharing and unicasting, eliminating the need for a central entity while still providing a highly personalized exposure risk assessment to users. In this third iteration, Safe Paths enables privacy protected participatory sharing of location trails by diagnosed carriers and direct notification of users who have been in close proximity to a diagnosed carrier without allowing a third party, particularly a government, to access individual location trails. Different technological interventions for contact-tracing pose various risks to individuals and the public. We will discuss and compare the main challenges of deploying these technologies in the following chapter and compare how the Private Kit: Safe Paths solution maximizes stakeholder value when trading off the key constraints as compared to existing solutions.",

Blanket-testing to avoid missing asymptomatic cases, of course, is not always feasible. Another approach is contact tracing, which involves keeping track of the possible routes of infection:The process for contact-tracing, according to WHO, occurs in three steps:1. Contact Identification: From confirmed cases, identify those the infected patient had contact with (according to the transmission modalities of the pathogen)2. Contact Listing: Record the possible contacts of the infected patients and contact those individuals3. Contact Follow-UpContact tracing is a key public health response to slowing the spread and containing infectious diseases. By mitigating the flaws of detection based solely on symptoms, contact-tracing increases the sensitivity and the readiness of the community for an emerging epidemic. Further, contact-tracing allows citizens to relieve burden from a community's containment measures, as it pushes perspective infected members to isolate themselves voluntarily as shown recently in the NYC area.",
