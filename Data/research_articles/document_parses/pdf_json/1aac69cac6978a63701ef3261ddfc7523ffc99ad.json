Traditionally, public health programs have focused on the health of populations, whereas the practice of medicine has focused on the health of individuals. It should be noted, however, that the population health management owes much to the effective delivery of clinical care. This chapter demonstrates how public health is intimately linked to patient care through human movement. Nearly a century ago, people typically did not develop a disease where it is contracted or even close to that place. Today, daily travel is a common way of life in modern metropolitan areas. Large, localized mosquito populations in areas that people visit regularly may be both reservoirs and hubs of infection, even if people only pass through those locations briefl y. By examining of the role of human movement across different scales, this chapter examines how public health communities can use information on pathogen transmission to increase the effectiveness of disease prevention programs and clinical care.",

The current chapter will highlight the role of geographic forces in the fi eld of travel medicine (also known as geographic medicine) and emphasize the role of geographic knowledge and thought in a study of disease that views humans has vectors and hosts. Chapter 9 will introduce a relatively new discipline, called geospatial medicine, that utilizes the advances in geospatial data and technology to uncover the genetic, social, and environmental effects of disease as it occurs throughout human development. This is an exciting new fi eld in which there is a tremendous potential for geographers to take center stage in answering some of the hard research questions that scientists have been grappling with for a long time. Lastly, Chap. 10 puts the fi nishing touches on the new portrait of medical geography that we have been painting, and frames it in a more centralized role on the national stage of the U.S. health care reform. A main objective of this book is to present a new model of patient care that emphasizes the patient's geographic and medical history, against the backdrop of contemporary globalization, while taking advantage of the current advances in geospatial data and technologies.",

Studies have shown that the ability to identify the sources (origins) and sinks (destinations) of imported infections due to human travel and locating the high-risk sites of parasite importation could greatly improve the control and prevention programs [ 3 , 4 ] . For instance, a group of researchers have combined mobile phone data with a high-resolution malaria prevalence map to analyze the regional travel patterns of nearly 15 million individuals over the course of a year in Kenya, in the context of parasitic dispersals. In this way, they were able to identify and map the sources and sinks of human and parasite travel in this country ( Fig. 8.1 ) [ 5 ] .",

An increase in the number of international travelers and local commuters has caused a surge of global and regional epidemics in the past several decades [ 8 ] . Travel-related risks include infections from food, vectors, and bodily fl uids. Most travelers (20-70 %) report health problems while traveling, but many do not seek pre-travel advice -such as vaccinations, prophylactics, and therapeutic medications [ 9 , 10 ] . Moreover, the risk of travel-related diseases is 2.3 times higher in those with an underlying medical conditions than in health individuals [ 10 ] . Given the unique health situations of travelers, there is a need for better characterization of the geographical and environmental risk factors underlying travel-related illnesses. To address these concerns, this chapter describes how human travelers who are infected can serve as an important route for the transmission of the virus from their place of origin to their place of destination. By understanding the effects of human movement on disease transmission, researchers can appropriately identify high-risk areas for effective intervention and control.",

            "text": "Historically, epidemiologists have viewed human movement from two main perspective. The fi rst perspective is from that of the populations of susceptible hosts moving into high-risk areas. The second perspective is from that of populations of infected hosts moving into susceptible populations. Movements of infected hosts across different spatial scales affect pathogen transmission in a variety of ways. Noted historian and geographer R. Mansell Prothero published one of the fi rst studies describing the role of human movements in epidemiology based on his experience in Africa, in 1977. Drawing on the geographic literature concerning diffusion and migration processes, he discussed the relevance of these movement patterns to public health in his seminal paper published in the International Journal of Epidemiology . He carefully outlined the differences between circulatory and migratory movements and categorized these movements by their spatial scale (i.e., a rural-urban gradient) and temporal scale (i.e., the time and timing of displacements). Circulatory movements are those in which the individuals return home after some period, and migratory movements are those which usually result in permanent changes of residence. Prothero's argument was that knowledge of the nature of these movements would help inform the public's understanding of the incidence and prevalence of disease on a population level and provide informed options for control [ 11 ] . For instance, seasonal migratory movements from one rural area to another for agriculture could potentially expose individuals to different areas where the risk of African trypanosomiasis, or malaria, is high [ 12 ] . At broad spatial scales (e.g., national, international), individual movements can drive pathogen introduction and reintroduction. For example, the global spread of dengue virus via shipping routes was characterized by periodic, large, spatial displacements. Globalization and mass air transportation have changed the transmission of pathogens by dramatically shortening the time required to travel around the earth. At fi ner scales (e.g., regional, urban-rural, intra-urban), movement associated with work, recreation, and transient migration into high-risk areas not only lead to individual infection, but also contribute to local transmission when infected hosts return home and infect other individuals ( Fig. 8. 2 ) [ 13 ] .",

Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of dengue virus. It bites during the day, disperses only short distances, and is heterogeneously distributed within urban areas. Humans, on the other hand, move frequently and allocate different amounts of time to multiple locations on a regular basis. Not only does this infl uence the individual risk of infection with dengue virus but it also infl uences overall patterns of transmission [ 16 ] . In addition, commuting and non-commuting patients have different diffusion patterns and determinants in a dengue epidemic. Non-commuters (e.g., elderly adults and housewives) may initiate a local epidemic, whereas commuters carrying the virus to geographically distant areas can cause a large-scale epidemic [ 17 ] .",

In addition, the ability to apply this knowledge to a variety of diseases creates an opportunity to identify common areas where infection occurs across multiple diseases and to leverage public health programs to target the most important locations that serve as sources for more than one disease. By examining of the role of human movement across different scales, public health communities can use this valuable information on pathogen transmission to increase the effectiveness of disease prevention programs. As transmission rates are reduced through intervention efforts, scientists can expect the importance of heterogeneity in exposure to increase and play an even more important role in pathogen persistence.

            "text": "Using a meta-population analysis where mobile humans connect with static mosquito subpopulations in a very structured pattern, a group of researchers found that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is independent of the duration of contact [ 26 ] . The researchers hypothesize that, since the biting rate is frequency dependent (and independent of the density of the human population), a mosquito will bite the same number of people per day. In addition, their modeled results indicate that people who travel regularly to areas with large mosquito populations form a high-risk group, and have a relatively high level of infection compared to people that travel regularly to patches with small mosquito populations. Furthermore, extensive variation in human movement patterns causes the number of interactions between human and mosquito populations to increase. More variable human movements increases the likelihood that people will carry the infection from these highly infested areas to mosquito subpopulations where the pathogen has died out. Therefore, a large mosquito population in a frequently visited area may be suffi cient to ensure infection is endemic, even if there are relatively few mosquitoes elsewhere. When people do not vary their travel patterns very much and there is no direct connectivity between mosquito populations, the transit corridor can signifi cantly enhance disease persistence by acting as a reservoir and hub. If people vary the areas they visit even occasionally, the effect of the transit corridor is overridden [ 26 , 27 ] .",

Nearly a century ago, it was observed that people do not develop a disease where it is contracted or even close to that place [ 28 ] . Today, widespread mass transportation makes that observation even more relevant. The incidence and persistence of vector-borne diseases on relatively small spatial scales may be strongly infl uenced by infectious humans who remain mobile because the infection is mild or silent. Increased human movement on a local scale may be a key factor behind increased incidence of vector-borne diseases.",

Further study of networks formed by human movement in urban areas are need, and cell phone records are one potential source of such detailed information [ 19 ] .",
