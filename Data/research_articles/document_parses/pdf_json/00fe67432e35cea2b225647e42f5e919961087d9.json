            "text": "24 A subset of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs, aka 25 mono-PARPs) is induced by type I interferons. Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral 26 activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-27 ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus 28 conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a 29 macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. 30 This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in 31 replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection 32 are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication 33 and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified 34 ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-35 dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein 36 nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a 37 functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction 38 of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a 39 decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This 40 suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a 41 hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We 42 hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found 43 that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing 44 polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized 45 by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic 46 explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. 47 3 Author Summary 48 Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever 49 new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased 50 human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause 51 world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic 52 rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs 53 are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic 54 function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-55 ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this 56 modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because 57 macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets. 58 59 Introduction 60 Upon viral infection host cells initiate an antiviral immune response. Because the regulation 61 of protein function through post-translational modifications (PTMs) is among the quickest 62 mechanisms to adapt to challenges such as viral infections, PTMs display an essential part of 63 antiviral signaling. Viruses have developed multifaceted strategies to evade or even hijack 64 cellular mechanisms, e.g. encoding proteins that regulate PTMs and thereby counteract the 65 antiviral reaction of the host [1-5]. Recent findings have elaborated on the role of intracellular 66 ADP-ribosylation at the host-pathogen interface [6-12]. ADP-ribosylation is an ancient PTM of 67 proteins and intracellularly mainly catalyzed by members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase 68 diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as poly-ADP-ribosylpolymerases (PARPs)), 69",

Based on their 71 4 catalytic features the ARTDs are subdivided into three classes. The first class contains ARTD1, 72 2, 5, and 6, which are capable of transferring multiple ADP-ribose moieties in an iterative 73 process and thereby forming long polymers. This results in poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) 74 of substrate proteins. The second and largest class is defined by members that are restricted 75 to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) (ARTD3, 4,(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(14)(15)(16)(17), whereas the third 76 group is defined by ARTD13, which lacks the ability to bind NAD + and thus is catalytically 77 inactive [18]. 78 79 PARylation, arguably best known for its function in DNA damage response, has also been 80 linked to chromatin organization, ribosome biogenesis, telomere maintenance, signaling 81 processes and cell death [1, 19, 20]. In contrast functions of MARylation are less well 82 understood but expanding with links to DNA damage repair, gene expression, signaling, stress 83 response and cell death [1, 21]. Recent findings indicate a role for MARylation in host-84 pathogen conflicts [1, 21, 22]. The expression of several mono-ARTDs is triggered by type I 85 interferons (IFNs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like LPS, as part of an 86 innate immune response to pathogens [6, 8, 11,[23][24][25]. Among these mono-ARTDs are ARTD7, 87 ARTD10 and ARTD12, which have been identified to mediate clearance of Venezuelan Equine 88",

In contrast, co-expression of nsP3 or the isolated nsP3 241 macrodomain was not sufficient to rescue replication of a hydrolase deficient replicon mutant 242 (Supplementary Fig. 4d-f ). To overcome possible differences in the subcellular localization of 243 replication hubs and plasmid-expressed nsP3 macrodomain, we fused the macrodomain to an 244 anti-GFP-nanobody to enhance targeting to sites of replication of the EGFP encoding 245 replicons.

Furthermore, MARylation is reported to 264 affect protein-protein interactions, mRNA stability and translation [1] .

His6-tagged fusion proteins of CHIKV nsP2 or nsP2-459-268 798, comprising the protease domain, were incubated with His6-tagged catalytic domains of 269 ARTD7, ARTD8, ARTD10 and ARTD12 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The corresponding genes 270 are IFNa responsive (Supplementary Fig. 1a and [6] ). Moreover, we tested ARTD15, which is 271 not regulated by IFNa ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). For all ARTD catalytic domains auto-ADP-272 ribosylation was measurable in presence of 32 P-NAD + even though the signal intensities varied 273 considerably between the different enzymes ( Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 6a The presence of nsP3 in ADP-ribosylation reactions using the catalytic domains of either 279 ARTD10 or ARTD12 reversed MARylation of nsP2 and the protease domain. Similarly, the 280 isolated macrodomain also efficiently de-MARylated nsP2 (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 6b) . 281",

In this context the 333 best studied ARTD family member is ARTD13 (ZAP, Zinc-finger antiviral protein), which is able 334 to bind viral RNA, promoting its decay or interfering with its translation [53] . Further, ARTD13, 335 which is catalytically inactive, contributes to the establishment of an antiviral immune 336 response by crosstalk with the miRNA pathway, thereby stimulating expression of antiviral 337 proteins, and by amplifying RIG-I signaling [53] . Antiviral activities have also been assigned to 338 ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14. Overexpression of these ARTDs was shown to interfere with 339 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication [7] .

ARTD12 has also been 343 identified to restrict Zika virus (ZIKV) replication, which is mediated by depletion of the ZIKV 344 non-structural proteins NS1 and NS3 [26] . Dependent on its catalytic activity, ARTD12 seems 345 to promote poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of these two viral proteins. PAR chains in turn 346 are argued to serve as scaffold to recruit E3 Ubiquitin-ligases that modify NS1 and NS3 by K48-347 linked polyubiquitination and thereby enable their proteasomal degradation [26] . Indeed, this 348 concept has already been established for PARylation mediated by ARTD5 and 6 (tankyrase 1 349 and 2, respectively) [1]. More than 70 substrates have been identified to be regulated through 350 PAR-mediated poly-ubiquitination [54] . The proposed mechanism is that ARTD12, as it is 351 limited to MARylation, modifies NS1 and NS3, which serves as a seeding event for polymer 352 forming ARTDs, possibly ARTD5 or 6 [26]. However, the effect of MARylation on CHIKV 353 replication seems to be different as demonstrated by experiments with inhibitors of 354 proteasomal and lysosomal pathways in this study (Fig. 3a, b) . In addition to the ZIKV proteins, 355 the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus (CoV) was recently suggested to be ADP-ribosylated 356 during infection [55] . It will be interesting to identify the enzyme that catalyzes this 357 modification and moreover to define the molecular consequences, for example on capsid 358 formation. 359",

Macrodomain mutations, 366 which disable hydrolase activity, interfere with SINV replication in neurons and prevent 367 neuropathy in mice [56], decrease pathogenicity and modulation of the host immune 368 response of CoV [11, 39], and severely impair viral replication of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) [57]. 369 Similarly, CHIKV replication is dependent on the MAR hydrolase activity of the macrodomain 370 (Figs. 2 and 3, Supplementary Fig. 4) [9, 45]. As pointed out above, in most cases it remains to 371 be defined what the relevant substrates of mono-ARTDs and viral macrodomains are and how 372 MARylation affects substrate functions. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the 373 inhibitory role of MARylation in CHIKV replication and establishes the concept that ARTD10-374 dependent MARylation of the viral protease inhibits its function, which is antagonized by the 375 viral macrodomain.

GFP-nsP2 or nsP2-2 EGFP translated from the replicon RNA were 605 immunoprecipitated with 5 \u00b5l GFP-Trap magnetic agarose beads (Chromotek) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. 606 Afterwards beads were washed in RIPA buffer and reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM 607 TCEP, 4 mM MgCl2). Subsequent hydrolase assays were carried out with bacterially expressed 608 and purified His-nsP3-macro in 10 \u00b5l reaction buffer for 30 min at 30\u00b0C. The reactions were 609 stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and 610 subjected to immunoblotting to visualize MARylation using the MAR reagent (with in vitro transcribed RNA or a plasmid encoding EGFP, cells were washed once 615 and resuspended in 500 \u00b5l PBS containing 2% heat-inactivated FCS. For the propidium iodide 616 (PI) single stain control, cells were then fixed and permeabilized in 80% ethanol for 30 min at 617 27 -20\u00b0C and afterwards were washed twice and resuspended in 500 \u00b5l PBS containing 2% heat-618 inactivated FCS. All other samples were not fixed or permeabilized. Subsequently 50 \u00b5g/ml of 619 PI solution (Sigma) were added to all samples and incubated in the dark for 20 min. A BD 620 FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience) was used for the flow cytometry analysis of the samples. 100,000 621 events were counted per sample per experiment. Evaluation of the experiments was 622 performed with the FlowJo software (BD Bioscience). 623 624 Virus infection and analysis of replication 625 Infectious CHIKV, strain LR2006-OPY, was produced by in vitro transcription of the linearized 626 full-length viral genome including an EGFP under a second subgenomic promotor [47] and 627 subsequent electroporation of the RNA in BHK-21 cells. The virus was passaged once in BHK-628 21 cells. Infections were performed under BSL-3 conditions using MOI determined by titration 629 on HEK293T cells. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA and infection efficiency was measured as the 630 proportion of EGFP-positive cells 24 and 48 hours post infection by flow cytometry using a BD 631 FACSLyric instrument (BD Bioscience). Evaluation of the experiments was performed with the 632 FACSSuite v1.2.1.5657 software (BD Bioscience). 633 634",
