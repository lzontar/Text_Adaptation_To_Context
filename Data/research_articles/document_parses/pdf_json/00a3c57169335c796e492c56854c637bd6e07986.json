One important objective of research on explainable agents is the evaluation of explanation approaches in humancomputer interaction studies. In this demonstration paper, we present a way to facilitate such studies by implementing explainable agents and multi-agent systems that i) can be deployed as static files, not requiring the execution of server-side code, which minimizes administration and operation overhead, and ii) can be embedded into web front ends and other JavaScript-enabled user interfaces, hence increasing the ability to reach a broad range of users. We then demonstrate the approach with the help of an application that was designed to assess the effect of different explainability approaches on the human intelligibility of an unmanned aerial vehicle simulation.",

A particularly motivating factor is that emerging laws and regulations, most notably the European Union's GDPR, require that certain decisions of information systems must be humanly interpretable [3] . Recent works in the literature highlighted explainability as one of the cornerstones for building trustworthy responsible AI systems [11, 12] . In this context, an obvious research frontier for the autonomous agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) community is the design of explainable intelligent agents [8] . This frontier is explained by the fact that while intelligent agents have been established as a suitable technique for implementing autonomous highlevel control and decision-making in complex AI systems [13] , there is still a need for these systems to be understood and trusted by the human users.",

Because the program code consists only of static files that are to be provided by a web server, it can be deployed in a straightforward manner, without the need of a complicated installation routine or the requirement to have extensive permissions on the target server. In particular, the program files can be moved to traditional static file servers (e.g., via FTP upload or via the upload feature of a content management system), or integrated into light-weight developer operations-oriented tools and services (e.g., continuous deployment to GitHub pages on push to a git repository's master branch). Reach. The explainable ABS can be easily shared with any potential human user who can access the Internet with a recent web browser. While for running HCI studies, oftentimes video vignettes are created to allow for easier sharing [1] , using such vignettes i) severely limits interactive features and ii) does not allow for convenient updates (minor changes, for example to the user interface, require re-recording the video(s)). Scalability. Because all program code is executed by the client, in particular by the browser of the corresponding end-user, applications developed with the proposed approach scale well; the server merely needs to provide (by all practical means: small) static files, which means researchers can host the applications essentially free of costs.",
