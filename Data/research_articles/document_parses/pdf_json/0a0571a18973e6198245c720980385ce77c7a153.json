The protein sequence of the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase (CCP) responsible for SARS viral replication has been identified as a target for developing anti-SARS drugs. Here, I report the ATVRLQ p1 A p1' -bound CCP 3D model predicted by 420 different molecular dynamics simulations (2.0 ns for each simulation with a 1.0-fs time step). This theoretical model was released at the Protein Data Bank (PDB; code: 1P76) before the release of the first X-ray structure of CCP (PDB code: 1Q2W). In contrast to the catalytic dyad observed in X-ray structures of CCP and other coronavirus cysteine proteinases, a catalytic triad comprising Asp187, His41, and Cys145 is found in the theoretical model of the substrate-bound CCP. The simulations of the CCP complex suggest that substrate binding leads to the displacement of a water molecule entrapped by Asp187 and His41, thus converting the dyad to a more efficient catalytic triad. The CCP complex structure has an expanded activesite pocket that is useful for anti-SARS drug design. In addition, this work demonstrates that multiple molecular dynamics simulations are effective in correcting errors that result from low-sequence-identity homology modeling.

The main-chain H atom of Leu p2 interacts with the main-chain O atom of Glu47 via a hydrogen bond relay of a water molecule. An oxyanion hole comprises Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 in the active site, and the scissile bond O atom of the substrate anchors at the oxyanion hole (Fig. 6) . The carbonyl group of the scissile bond is best oriented for the nucleophilic attack by the thiolate of Cys145. This structural feature suggests that the Michaelis-Menten state of the CCP complex is close to the transition state, and therefore the catalytic efficiency of the CCP is expected to be high. The methyl group of Ala p1' is rigidly packed in the active site, preventing His41 from forming hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The side chain of Gln p1 adopts at least five different conformations that enable one or two hydrogen bonds with the main-chain O atom of Arg p3 , the side-chain O atom of Glu166, the main-chain O atom of Leu p2 via the hydrogen bond relay of a water molecule, the guanidinium H atoms of Arg p3 , and the N \u2440 atom of His163 (Fig. 6 ). Both side chains of Leu p2 and Val p4 are rigidly packed in the hydrophobic regions of the active site. The Arg p3 residue is flexible in the active site as well.",

Related to this conformational difference, the ammonium group of Lys61 forms a hydrogen bond with His80 in the MMDS model, but it is away from His80 in the X-ray structures (Fig. 8) . The SWISS-MODEL program incorrectly predicted the side-chain conformation of Lys61 in which the ammonium group was surrounded by hydrophobic residues Ile43, Leu58, Phe66, Leu87, and Leu89. It has been reported that substrate binding in acetylcholinesterase can cause a large conformational change of a remote Arg residue (Fig. 9 ). Interestingly, the conformational difference of Arg in acetylcholinesterase between the bound and the unbound states is akin to the conformational difference of Lys61 in the CCP between the bound and the unbound states. 28 Further computational and/or experimental studies are required to determine whether this difference is caused by substrate binding or by an error of the homology modeling that cannot be corrected by the MMDSs.",

Therefore the methyl group of Met165 leaves more room to accommodate Val p4 of the substrate in the MMDS model than it does in the X-ray structure of the apo-CCP (Fig. 8) . This reflects the difference of the CCP in the bound and the unbound states and suggests that the MMDS model with an expanded active-site pocket is useful for virtual screening of chemical databases for the CCP inhibitor leads. 29 Table II lists the torsions for the comparison of the backbone conformation of the substrate in the MMDS model with that of the inhibitor in the X-ray structure of a CCP complex (PDB code: 1UK4). 5 In the crystal structure, the inhibitor, AsnSerThrLeuGlnChloromethylKetone, was soaked into the active site of the CCP. 5 Residues at the p6, p1, and p1' positions in the MMDS model are excluded in the comparison because the corresponding residues are either missing or modified in the X-ray structure. 5 The side-chain conformations are excluded in the comparison too, because the sequences of the two peptides are different except for the p2 residue. For Leu p2 , the RMSD of all heavy atoms of Leu between the theoretical and experimental structures is 0.72 \u00c5, indicating that the two conformations of the p2 residue in the two structures are almost the same. As apparent from Table II , the two backbone conformations of the peptides in the theoretical and experimental structures are nearly the same; on the contrary, the two backbone conformations of the same peptide before and after the two-stage MMDS refinement are radically different as indicated by the large differences of torsions in the p3 and p5 residues. Again, the MMDS refinement is significant and necessary in protein complex structure modeling as demonstrated by the torsions in Table II .",

Sequence analysis reveals that Asp187 of the CCP corresponds to Asp186 of TGEVMP (Fig. 1) . Asp186 is reportedly conserved among the main proteinases of feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus, human coronavirus 229E, bovine coronavirus, murine hepatitis coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (GenBank accession codes: AF326575, X69721, AF391542, M55148, M95169, and AJ271965, respectively). 15 In the first set of simulations, a water molecule was occasionally sandwiched by Cys145 and His41 or by His41 and Asp187 when the peptide substrate failed to shield the catalytic triad from water (Fig. 5 ). This observation is consistent with reports that a water molecule is entrapped by the catalytic His and Asp residues in X-ray structures of coronavirus cysteine proteinases and a related 3C proteinase. 3, 14, 15 Interestingly, no water molecule was entrapped at the catalytic triad in the second set of simulations because the tight binding of the peptide at the active site completely shields the triad from water. The present results suggest that substrate binding leads to the displacement of a water molecule entrapped by Asp187 and His41, thus converting the dyad to a more efficient catalytic triad in which the nucleophilicity of the thiol group of Cys145 is increased by the hydrogen bonding of His41 to the carboxylate of Asp187.",

The last instantaneous structure could be misleading, but it is reasonable to expect that 200 such structures resulting from different simulations represent the sampling of the MMDSs. The two calculated distances (D S-C and D H-O ) of the 200 simulations range continuously from 3.1 to 5.9 \u00c5 and 2.1 to 17.5 \u00c5, respectively and demonstrate the conformational diversities of the substrate and the active site of the CCP in the 200 simulations. Furthermore, 99% of the D S-C and D H-O values can be found in multiple simulations, indicating that there was sufficient sampling of the conformations of the CCP and its substrate.",
