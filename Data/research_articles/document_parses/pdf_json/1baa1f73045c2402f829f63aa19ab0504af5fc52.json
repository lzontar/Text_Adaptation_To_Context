By enshrining the BRI in China's own Party constitution in 2017, its long-term significance as a major pillar of external engagement cannot be overstated. 6 In a bid to support funding for its initiative, aside from Chinese state-owned policy banks and the US$40 billion Silk Road Fund, China also created a new multilateral development institution in the form of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Comparisons have already been made by Beijing between the BRI and the US Marshall Plan, raising awareness of the high ambitions China has put behind the initiative.",

            "text": "The EU, on the other hand, did not feel any urgency to openly react to the BRI until more recently, but China's rhetoric and active engagement forced the EU to draft a strategy to engage with the BRI in a more coordinated fashion. The news of targeted tech-takeovers of European companies by Chinese companies in 2015 and 2016, together with 'promise fatigue' about China's economic reform process and restricted access to the Chinese market, also led to changes in the EU's perception of China as a reliable partner in building a multilateral system based on reciprocal market access and competitive neutrality. Against this backdrop the EU launched the Connectivity Strategy for Asia in September 2018, which tries to engage Eurasian connectivity in accordance with the EU's values and operating principles and is seeking closer coordination on Eurasian infrastructure investment with Japan. 7 Other consequences of the above-mentioned change of perception are ongoing adjustments in the EU's policies towards China, especially the establishment of a foreign direct investment screening mechanism and the heightened tenor of 'reciprocity' in EU-China relationships. In the EU's Strategic Outlook on China from March 2019, the EU for the first time referred to China as a 'systemic rival', marking a new level of sobering realism in EU-China relations. 8 closIng In on evolvIng chInese and european IdentItIes Identity can be seen as a foundational moment of collective distinctiveness and purpose. 9 It is also relational, which incorporates the dichotomy of the 'self' vis-\u00e0-vis the 'other' and affects actors' speech and actions. 10 This is also true for the European Union and China. Identity is in a sense a form of essentialisation of certain characteristics or events that form part of the history of a person, group, party, nation, etc.-an ephemeral and constantly evolving configuration. What it lacks in accuracy and objective truth, it makes up through emotive charge and its potential to coordinate and arouse individual or collective action. Identity or narrative construction is an essential part of nation building. States build identity around categories such as shared values or history, thereby creating expectations regarding the behaviour of individuals and groups. For this chapter, it is therefore useful to explore the most prominent official narratives that to this day shape perceptions of self and otherness in China and the EU, and analyse in what sense these narratives also form a part of the BRI and the Connectivity Strategy.",

            "text": "In the case of China, it is recognised that its transformation from the end of the Qing dynasty in 1911 to a modern nation state has been a painstaking and difficult process fraught by foreign incursions, war and rivalling ideologies. The official key narrative shaping Chinese identity and national consciousness is that China is heir to an ancient and rich civilisation, which perceived itself as the centre of the world, not as a nation among many. The contact with militarily superior foreign imperialist powers of the nineteenth century humiliated and degraded China, forcing it to agree to unequal treaties and granting extraterritorial privileges to foreigners on their own terms. China's quest for modernity starts with the desire to remove this stain of national humiliation inflicted at the hands of foreign powers. When the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) emerged victorious from the Civil War and founded the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong in 1949, it set as its task to restore China's pre-eminent position among nations. China's rise however does not stop there. In the years after the death of Chairman Mao and with the beginning of economic reform and opening-up in 1979, supreme leader Deng Xiaoping brought China's economy back on track, growth was restored and China gradually created a more open and international image through the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. At the same time, China's core narrative of the need to avoid current and future humiliation by foreign powers by achieving national rejuvenation has not changed but is continually evolving. In 2013, China's President Xi Jinping coined the newest version of that narrative by proclaiming the 'Chinese Dream of National Rejuvenation'. 11 What is at the core of national rejuvenation and avoiding humiliation is to increase China's national wealth and power. 12 The term fuqiang (wealth and power) is akin to 'national interest' in a Westphalian sense, and has become the single most coherent pursuit of Chinese political modernity. Also today, whenever its national interest is under perceived or real threat, China reflexively invokes the nefarious influence of 'foreign forces' 13 and the need to keep working on increasing its national strength as the only way to avoid future bullying by foreign powers.",

It has been accompanied by a new assertiveness since President Xi came to power in 2012. This assertiveness is compounded by China's international achievements over the past decade, such as overtaking Germany and Japan as the world's export champion and becoming the second-largest economy in terms of GDP after the US. China's slowing but still competitive economic growth rate of over 6 per cent in early 2020 before Covid-19 hit the world, its success in poverty alleviation over the last decades, impressive infrastructure development and rapid industrialisation have all contributed to the awareness of being a rising economic power. Under President Xi, China felt prepared to eschew Deng Xiaoping's well-proven doctrine of 'avoiding the limelight and honing one's abilities' (taoguang yanghui) in favour of a more confident display of its new 'four confidences'-confidence in the way of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, 15 its theories, 16 political system 17 and culture. 18 This new confidence has also meant China becoming more vocal about defending its national interests abroad and not shying away from using its economic and rhetorical muscle to pressure foreign companies or countries into submission in cases where they dare criticise official Chinese policy or otherwise 'hurt the feelings of the Chinese people'. 19 At the core, we see that national humiliation and rejuvenation in the case of China, and national reconciliation and a rules-based global order in the case of the EU, are still the defining hallmarks of their respective identities to this day. What will be the bearing of these narratives on China and the EU's economic diplomacy in the twenty-first century?",

The Connectivity Strategy has its sources in joint economic cooperation under the ASEM process, without the large political fanfare associated with the BRI. It instead aims at transforming Asian and European societies by delivering quality projects through comprehensive, sustainable and rules-based economic cooperation (Table 8. 2). 22 In order to better illustrate these differences, this chapter will present here a comparison of the BRI and the Connectivity Strategy according to several parameters.",

For the EU, with its strong multilateral tradition, the Connectivity Strategy includes the 30 European and 21 Asian partner countries of the ASEM process, and among others the ASEAN Plus Three, Russia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, etc. The BRI incorporates 6 main economic corridors and stresses the priority of its immediate neighbourhood policy. 23 But in addition to that, the BRI is inherently open by design. It does not have any geographical or institutional limitations and was also mentioned in connection with the participation of African and Latin American countries. As stated by President Xi, every project that serves China's interest and helps to 'make friends' and improve people's life can be a part of the BRI. It is thus open to cooperation from all countries or multilateral institutions and is intended to provide a friendly narrative to mollify critics of China's economic rise and help promote its strategic interests. While its main focus is on connectivity as a means to sustain growth and improve livelihoods, it also includes This purported 'open design' or lack of precision regarding geographic reach and purpose of the BRI is to some extent deliberate. Ambiguity is not only an important part of the initiative itself, it is one of its key advantages. Vagueness or openness fit with China's doctrine of 'experimentalism', where the central government first pronounces a policy framework and then lets others try to look for ways towards its realisation. Successful examples are then scaled up and can become national policy. 24 In addition to being open in terms of participation, China also remains vague about the financial scale of the BRI and the timescale of its implementation, with estimates ranging from several hundred million to several trillion dollars in connectivity finance over the next few years. At the second BRI summit in April 2019, President Xi signalled both China's determination and openness about the financing of the BRI, while also confirming that China had signed new BRI-related deals worth US$64 billion: \u2026we will continue to make good use of the Belt and Road Special Lending Scheme, the Silk Road Fund, and various special investment funds, develop Silk Road theme bonds, and support the Multilateral Cooperation Center for Development Finance in its operation. We welcome the participation of multilateral and national financial institutions in BRI investment and financing and encourage third-market cooperation. 25 Also, the EU is working hard on building financial leverage of the Connectivity Strategy and has increased its external action budget for 2021-2027 to \u20ac123 billion, of which \u20ac10 billion would go to Asia and the Pacific as part of the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument. An additional \u20ac60 billion euro is being included as investment framework for external action, such as connectivity projects in the EU neighbourhood, the Western Balkans, Africa, etc. 26 Second, regarding core principles, we see that there are a lot of synergies and co-dependencies between the initiatives. According to Zou Lei from the Shanghai Party Institute, the central principles of the BRI are openness for cooperation, market principle and shared benefits (win-win). 27 To these three, the often-cited principle of 'extensive consultation' would definitely have to be added. What Beijing means by this term is a reference to pragmatism and national interest, as well as to the importance of diplomacy in international relations to strike a balance of interests.",

Additionally, in terms of the number of people reached, the Connectivity Strategy is currently no match for the BRI, in part because of the coherent diplomatic effort that the Chinese government has put into promoting their flagship initiative.

The ability to co-opt other groups and states by one's mere behaviour and have them identify with one's own narrative or cause is a key element of diplomacy, and an indispensable step towards becoming a global power. China can lay claim to its ancient sources of soft power in form of the 'lai hua narrative' (come to China and become sinified), the attraction of Confucian civilisation and the pre-eminent status of the Chinese emperor, which influenced other states or people through the attractiveness of China's superior culture and civilisation rather than brute force. Having understood the need to have China's official story heard across the globe, Chinese leaders have launched large-scale initiatives to increase China's international discourse power. A decade before the BRI, China launched its Confucius Institutes under then President Hu Jintao to spread the Chinese language and culture overseas. In 2013, with the BRI under President Xi Jinping, the focus shifted from cultural to economic diplomacy, but under the same principles. The BRI represents in its essence a grand strategy to increase China's 'discourse power' (huayu quan) 31 abroad, and to have its official voice heard. Its reference to the historic Silk Roads is of great benefit in this regard as it evokes positive associations and creates a sense of historic legitimacy in support of China's narrative.",

Starting from China's reform and opening-up period under Deng Xiaoping, it has consistently projected its identity through its values and policies. These can be summed up in three points: (1) the right of sovereign states to a pragmatist and flexible foreign policy, (2) being a role model in terms of national rejuvenation and economic development for the Global South or other developing countries, and (3) straddling the twin objectives of preserving one's traditional culture and values together with rapid modernisation of the country.",

In its understanding of international relations, China did not move very far from the five principles of peaceful coexistence dating from the 1950s, which are still relevant for it today. 32 Being aware that China has to show more than that to the international community if it wants to present itself as a positive actor in building a multilateral system of global governance, it skilfully created another narrative-President Xi Jinping's 'Community of shared future for mankind'. 33 This phrase has also been enshrined into the Party Constitution, and was adopted in a UN Security Resolution for the first time in 2017, marking a major diplomatic victory for China.

Furthermore, China funded projects most often are tied with Chinese companies, and are much more to the benefit of China than of the local countries. Frequently lacking a transparent bidding process, they are generally less open to local or international companies. Importantly, China typically provides loans to countries rather than investments, which can have a profound impact on national debt, as in the case of Montenegro. 38 The EU has come to terms with the fact that China's new status in the world and economic overtures of win-win cooperation across the globe require some level of policy coordination on the part of the EU. In that regard, 2019 was an important year. In the new EU Strategic Outlook on China from April 2019, China was referred to for the first time as a systemic rival. The report further elaborated that The European Commission now regards China simultaneously as a cooperation partner with whom the EU has closely aligned objectives, a negotiating partner with whom the EU needs to find a balance of interests, an economic competitor in pursuit of technological leadership, and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance. 39 The launch of the Europa Connectivity Forum in Brussels in September 2019, jointly opened by EU President Jean-Claude Juncker and Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe, marks a decisive step towards advancing the EU's flagship connectivity strategy with Japan as its key partner in Asia. While China's BRI is still perceived as a major chance for reviving investment and growth, the EU seems to be more and more 'receptive to business complaints that China is buying up EU firms and their technologies while denying reciprocal access to Chinese markets'. 40 To further protect its economic interests, the EU also adopted a regulation on screening foreign direct investment from non-EU countries in March 2019, with the aim of protecting security and public order. 41 While the EU mandate for action is still small in that regard when compared to similar mechanisms in the US, Japan or China, it still marks an important step towards economic realism.",

He added that for China, supporting European unity and prosperity was a strategic choice given the absence of geopolitical contradictions and conflicts of interest. 42 The question China has yet to answer, and which will be essential for gauging its reliability to other nations, is whether it would submit under international norms and rules that it itself has helped co-create? Will it allow rules to limit its radius of action or will its famous 'win-win' mean that China always wins twice? At the second international BRI forum, China showed that it can be responsive to international criticism and tried to perform adjustments to the BRI in 2019 in reaction to accusations of debt traps and seizures of strategic assets.",

With a bilateral trade volume of more than \u20ac500 billion a year and a joint belief in multilateral engagement, the EU and China know their partnership is too important to the world to not get it right. While the official objectives of the BRI and the Connectivity Strategy show many synergies and there is a healthy level of competition between them, it is rather the political question of how to guarantee 'reciprocity' and 'shared benefits' in a closer relationship with China that causes uncertainty and tension. In a pre covid-19 world, the year 2020 was seen as a critical juncture for the future of China-EU relations with two high-level meetings and a possible breakthrough in negotiations on the much-anticipated EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). While covid-19 and its wider impact have somewhat dampened these hopes, China and the EU should eventually realise that their respective connectivity agendas are best served by further strengthening mutual economic cooperation and assisting each other to make a speedy recovery from the crisis. Worsening geopolitical rivalry and lingering mutual mistrust will however not make this an easy task.",
