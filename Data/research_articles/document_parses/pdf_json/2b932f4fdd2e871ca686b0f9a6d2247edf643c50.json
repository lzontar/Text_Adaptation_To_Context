Here, the physiological role of chromosomally encoded type II TASs in EcN was examined. We showed that gene pair ECOLIN_00240-ECOLIN_00245 and ECOLIN_08365-ECOLIN_08370 were two functional TASs encoding CcdAB and HipAB, respectively. The homologs of CcdAB and HipAB were more conserved in E. coli species belonging to pathogenic groups, suggesting their important roles in EcN. CRISPRi-mediated repression of ccdAB and hipAB significantly reduced the biofilm formation of EcN in the stationary phase. Moreover, ccdAB and hipAB were shown to be responsible for the persister formation in EcN. Biofilm and persister formation of EcN controlled by the ccdAB and hipAB were associated with the expression of genes involved in DNA synthesis, SOS response, and stringent response. Besides, CRISPRi was proposed to be an efficient tool in annotating multiple TASs simultaneously.

Previous studies showed that biofilm formation promotes the ability of Lactobacillus strains in resistance to temperature, gastric pH and mechanical forces (Salas-Jara et al. 2016) , and a bile-induced biofilm formation during stationary growth allows Bifidobacteria strains for strong colonization in the gastrointestinal tract (Ambalam et al. 2014) . It is evident that the probiotic mechanism of EcN is inseparable from its colonization ability (Hancock et al. 2010) . Beyond the contribution of pili (F1A, F1C, and curly fimbriae), iron chelating carriers, and uptake systems, the better capacity of EcN in biofilm formation competitively inhibits adhesion and invasion of pathogenic E. coli to intestinal epithelial cells (Dembinski et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2014) . Persister cells firstly reported in the early 1940s are phenotypic variants in a given population that presents antibiotic tolerance due to their slow or non-growing state (Page and Peti 2016) . Persister cells are able to revert to normal growth when the adverse stimuli such as antibiotics are removed. As studies progressed, forming persister cells has been generally accepted as an important strategy for bacteria to survive upon hostile environments (Page and Peti 2016; Van den Bergh et al. 2017) . Moreover, the persistence phenomenon has been widely described and determined in E. coli. Therefore, it is likely that cells in a persistent state will be helpful for EcN to become the winner during outcompeting with the pathogenic enteric microbiome in the intestine. However, the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the biofilm and persister formation of EcN is inadequate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 377, "end": 401, "text": "(Salas-Jara et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 550, "end": 571, "text": "(Ambalam et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 669, "end": 690, "text": "(Hancock et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 948, "end": 971, "text": "(Dembinski et al. 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 972, "end": 990, "text": "Jiang et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1185, "text": "(Page and Peti 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1448, "end": 1468, "text": "(Page and Peti 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1495, "text": "Van den Bergh et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Multiple signaling layers have been reported to participate in modulating biofilm and persister formation, including stringent control (Fujita et al. 2017 ), quorum sensing system (Li et al. 2018 ), c-di-GMP signaling pathway (Moreira et al. 2017) , and toxin-antitoxin system (TAS) (Sun et al. 2017 ). Among these, TAS has attracted much attention due to their critical roles in cell physiologies such as programmable cell death, biofilm formation, and persister formation (Harms et al. 2018; Page and Peti 2016) . A typical TAS constituted a bicistron line which is composed of a stable toxin or growth arrest factor and its unstable inhibitor (antitoxin) (Yang and Walsh 2017) . Currently, six types of TASs have been classified, wherein the distribution and prevalence of type II are the most dominant and universal in bacteria and Archaea (Page and Peti 2016) . In E. coli, more than ten kinds of type II TASs have been studied, of which the F-plasmid-based ccdAB and high persistence allele hipAB are two of the best characterized and identified that are mainly responsible for the plasmid maintenance and persister formation, respectively (Ogura and Hiraga 1983; Semanjski et al. 2018; Wen et al. 2014 ). However, the relevant knowledge in EcN is still insufficient. In addition to their critical roles in physiologies, TASs have recently been developed as an efficient counterselectable marker in E. coli recombineering. For example, the toxic gene ccdB is developed as a counterselection module to improve seamless mutagenesis and the efficiency of high-throughput, restriction-free cloning, and screening process in E. coli (Wang et al. 2014; Lund et al. 2014) .

Almost, the probiotic EcN and pathogenic E. coli, rather than the commensal group, shared the same types and distribution of TASs. Previous studies revealed that the distribution of TASs in E. coli is linked with living niches, and the number of TA loci per strain is different among phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, and D) (Fiedoruk et al. 2015) . Furthermore, horizontal gene transfer is responsible for the TAS evolution of E. coli by gene insertion and deletion (Ramisetty and Santhosh 2016) . Therefore, the TASs in EcN and other pathogenic strains are suggested to undergo similar evolutionary history, which may result from similar stress stimuli. CcdAB and HipAB are well-known modules involved in plasmid maintenance and bacterial persistence. As the firstly identified and well-studied TAS, plasmid-encoded CcdAB is mainly involved in plasmid maintenance via a process known as postsegregational killing (Ogura and Hiraga 1983) . The chromosomal ccd operon of E. coli O157 is involved in drug tolerance, conferring protection from cell death indicates the same strain. \"*\" represents that there is a significant difference between two studied groups (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001) during exposure to multiple antibiotic stress (Gupta et al. 2017) . To our knowledge, the role of CcdAB in biofilm formation is still unclear to date. Our results suggest that CcdAB facilitates the biofilm formation of EcN under given conditions (Fig. 5a) . Accordingly, changes in the transcription level of several genes associated with biofilm formation were observed. The inhibition of ccdAB expression induced the upregulated expression of genes involved in the stringent response (rpoS and relA) (Fig. 6a) , which supported the previous findings in E. coli wherein rpoS deletion increased the biofilm formation of strain O157:H7 and a relA mutant of DS291 had improved ability to build biofilm (Balzer and McLean 2002; Sheldon et al. 2012) . Previously, HipA has been restricted to its role in persistence mediation via triggering nutrition starvation through the phosphorylating of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GltX), tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, and other substrates, whereas its role in biofilm formation is rarely reported (Germain et al. 2013; Semanjski et al. 2018; Vang Nielsen et al. 2019 ). Zhao and co-workers showed that HipA affects biofilm formation through DNA release (Zhao et al. 2013) . Here, transcriptional repression of hipAB significantly reduced the expression of gyrA, suggesting that one positive role of HipAB in regulating the biofilm formation of EcN is achieved by increasing the DNA synthesis. Knockdown expression of hipAB also caused the upregulated expression of genes involved in the stringent response, which further suggests that stringent response may function negatively in the biofilm formation of EcN. Interestingly, the expression of hfq and recA were upregulated when the transcription of hipAB and ccdAB were inhibited, contradicting the previous finding that recA deletion reduced the biofilm production by 22-80% in E. coli when exposed to the sub-MIC of ciprofloxacin (Recacha et al. 2019 ). Our results suggest that recA may act negatively in the biofilm formation of EcN. Thus, how SOS response contributes to the biofilm formation of EcN needs future investigation. RNA chaperone Hfq is a well-known stress response regulator and functions primarily in sRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation via facilitating the pairing between sRNAs and their target mRNAs (Henderson et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2019 ). E. coli seems less prone to form biofilm upon the deletion of hfq, which contradicts our observation here that upregulation of hfq expression corresponded to lower biofilm formation (Kulesus et al. 2008; Ramos et al. 2014) . Furthermore, it is interesting that decreased expression of focA that is responsible for F1C fimbriae synthesis in EcN only appeared in case of the simultaneous knockdown expression of ccdAB and hipAB (Fig. 6a ). F1C fimbriae has been shown to be indispensable in the biofilm formation of E. coli wherein focA mutant is defective in biofilm building (Lasaro et al. 2009 ). Thus, we propose that the contribution of F1C fimbriae to the biofilm formation of EcN is mediated by CcdAB and HipAB on multiple levels. Overall, the mechanisms involved in the biofilm formation of EcN are complicated; CcdAB and HipAB are suggested to achieve a collectively positive regulating role at least (Fig. 7) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 602, "end": 624, "text": "(Fiedoruk et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 744, "end": 773, "text": "(Ramisetty and Santhosh 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1215, "text": "(Ogura and Hiraga 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1541, "text": "(Gupta et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2200, "text": "(Balzer and McLean 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2221, "text": "Sheldon et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2507, "end": 2528, "text": "(Germain et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2529, "end": 2551, "text": "Semanjski et al. 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2552, "end": 2576, "text": "Vang Nielsen et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2681, "text": "(Zhao et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 3393, "end": 3413, "text": "(Recacha et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3798, "end": 3821, "text": "(Henderson et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3822, "end": 3837, "text": "Liu et al. 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 4023, "end": 4044, "text": "(Kulesus et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 4045, "end": 4063, "text": "Ramos et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 4416, "end": 4435, "text": "(Lasaro et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1722, "end": 1731, "text": "(Fig. 5a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1987, "text": "(Fig. 6a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 4267, "end": 4275, "text": "(Fig. 6a", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 4749, "end": 4757, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Studies of bacterial persistence in E. coli have been widely performed, of which toxin-antitoxin systems are generally accepted to be the regulators of persistence (Page and Peti 2016; Semanjski et al. 2018) .

Nevertheless, we suggest here that the persister formation of EcN in the stationary phase is mediated by CcdAB and HipAB. On the other hand, it was interesting to find that knockdown expression of hipAB induced upregulation of rpoS and relA expression, which was usually observed in case of HipA overexpression (Durfee et al. 2008; Kaspy et al. 2013 ). This may be explained that the stringent response is simultaneously controlled by other mechanisms while the silence of hipAB expression seems to promote this process. Besides, we found that the transcriptional halt of hipAB induced SOS response (Fig. 6b) . The direct link between HipAB and SOS response is rarely reported in E. coli, whereas our results suggest that persister formation mediated by HipAB may have an indirect correlation with SOS response in EcN (Fig. 7) . CcdB inhibits DNA replication by binding to gyrase-DNA complex and blocking the DNA polymerase passage, leading to DNA doublestrand breaks and cell growth inhibition (Bahassi et al. 1999 ). Thus, it is possible that the repressed expression of ccdB will promote DNA replication. This case was found in EcN where knockdown expression of ccdAB resulted in the upregulation of gyrA expression. Moreover, it was surprising to find the upregulation of recA expression in \u0394ccdAB mutant since this generally happens upon ccdB overexpression (Tripathi et al. 2012 ). This could not be ascribed to the experimental bias since the survival of the \u0394ccdAB mutant was significantly increased during exposure to norfloxacin (Fig. 6b) , indicating that expression of recA is regulated by other unknown mechanisms. Thus, a future study aiming to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying intrinsic correlation between TASs (e.g., CcdAB), SOS response, and persister formation will enhance our understanding of the persistence phenomenon in EcN.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 184, "text": "(Page and Peti 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 185, "end": 207, "text": "Semanjski et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 297, "end": 322, "text": "(Goormaghtigh et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 637, "end": 657, "text": "(Durfee et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 658, "end": 675, "text": "Kaspy et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1341, "text": "(Bahassi et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1689, "end": 1710, "text": "(Tripathi et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 925, "end": 934, "text": "(Fig. 6b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1152, "text": "(Fig. 7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1874, "text": "(Fig. 6b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Toxin-antitoxin systems, the potential regulator in EcN for bacterial interference?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The use of antimicrobial compounds in the treatment of bowel disorders caused by the infection of pathogenic E. coli and other fatal bacteria is controversial because of the emergence of antibiotic resistance (persistence) as well as observed increased endotoxin release after antibiotic exposure in some enteropathogen (Bielaszewska et al. 2012; Mohsin et al. 2015) . In past decades, the probiotic EcN has been widely used in the treatment of intestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and inflammatory bowel disease due to its high ability in competing with enteropathogen (Chen et al. 2017; Huebner et al. 2011; Rembacken et al. 1999) . EcN has been reported to have a better capacity in biofilm formation and help to outcompete the most known pathogenic E. coli (Hancock et al. 2010) . However, in addition to the finding that F1C fimbriae are necessary for the biofilm formation of EcN, largely unknown factors involved in the regulation of biofilm formation are waiting for elucidation (Lasaro et al. 2009 ). Besides, whether the formation of persister cells helps EcN combat with other bacteria and survive under hostile environments in the intestine remains elusive. The results obtained in this study shed some light on this field. Thus, to prompt the application of EcN in bacterial interference, a future study focusing on the elucidation of the correlation between TASs, robust biofilm, and persister formation of EcN during intestine colonization will be helpful.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 346, "text": "(Bielaszewska et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 347, "end": 366, "text": "Mohsin et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 599, "end": 617, "text": "(Chen et al. 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 618, "end": 638, "text": "Huebner et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 639, "end": 661, "text": "Rembacken et al. 1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 790, "end": 811, "text": "(Hancock et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1035, "text": "(Lasaro et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "CRISPRi is proposed to be an efficient tool in annotating toxin-antitoxin systems in situ A common difficulty encountered during the study of specific TAS is functional redundancy with other TASs as well as the number duplicates (Ramage et al. 2009 ). Deletion and restoration of gene expression are the methods that have been usually adopted to annotate the function of a given gene. In contrast to one gene, sometimes, multiple TASs needed to be knocked out before there is an observable phenotype, which asks for a long period for molecular manipulation (Kim et al. 2009; Kolodkin-Gal et al. 2009 ). In this case, an efficient and convenient molecular tool is of great importance. Currently, the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system has been widely employed in the regulation of gene expression (Kim et al. 2020; Qi et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2019) . However, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the CRISPRi tool is applied in the functional Fig. 7 Model of identified HipAB and CcdAB-mediated genes in EcN. Transcriptional silencing of hipAB by CRISPRi inhibits the expression of a gene involved in DNA replication (gyrA) and upregulates the expression of genes involved in stringent response (rpoS and relA), SOS response (recA and lexA), and RNA interaction (hfq); transcriptional silencing of ccdAB by CRISPRi inhibits lexA expression and upregulates the expression of gyrA, rpoS, relA, recA, and hfq. These changes eventually lead to the reduced biofilm formation and persister formation upon gentamycin treatment in EcN annotation of type II TASs. To inhibit the expression of either ccdB or hipA, we designed three N20 sequences for each gene. The results showed that each of them was functional but with different efficiency (data not shown). By choosing the best N20 sequences, two chromosomal TASs ccdAB and hipAB in EcN were annotated smoothly, suggesting that CRISPRi could be a strong candidate tool in TAS study among E. coli as well as other bacteria. On the other hand, CRISPRi is capable of producing different levels of the expression of a targeted gene either by knocking down or activating, thus helping to study the behavioral changes of cells upon various conditions (Tao et al. 2018) . This makes sense when we consider the clinical application of EcN where cell viability is one important factor that determines the therapeutic process. In general, we could enhance the oral delivery to guarantee the therapeutic effect. Our findings suggest that sustaining the cell viability of EcN dynamically under the intestine environment by regulating the expression of TAS is preferable and constructive. In addition, genetic engineering of the EcN chromosome usually happens for EcN-based vaccine development, in which the increased or decreased gene expression of interest is necessary (Chaudhari et al. 2017; Ou et al. 2016) .
