One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.\" JFK The Covid-19 pandemic has been disruptive to individuals, organizations, universities, markets, governments and the healthcare industry worldwide. It has simultaneously provided an opportunity for thoughtful engagement and potential improvements in nearly every circumstance. While the COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed health care management, there has also been a significant impact on surgical training. Much of the resident and fellow operative experience is completely halted or significantly reduced as surgical trainees are deployed elsewhere to perform shift work, mostly in intensive care units or emergency rooms, managing the sickest of those affected by COVID-19. Most programs have suspended all nonurgent procedures. In some programs, residents are not operating at all as efforts exist to reduce individual exposure to COVID-19 infection by maintaining in-patient services to an absolute minimum except for the occasional emergency. For many future cardiothoracic surgeons, their principle procedures at present may be simple bedside procedures learned during internship such as arterial and central venous line insertion, intubation, tracheostomy or peripheral cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation rather than complex cardiac surgical procedures that would enhance their skill base. Across procedural fields, a major imbalance of resident-ability to case-complexity has occurred.",

For many trainees in cardiothoracic surgery, the latter half of their final year of training is the most impactful, with access to increasingly complex cases and greater autonomy. These trainees have matured to competently perform their most complex cases during this crucial time while still under the guidance and supervision of seasoned faculty educators. Training is most commonly time delineated and progressive prior to transition to the next phase of their career -either an additional subspecialty fellowship (e.g., congenital, transplant, structural heart, etc.) or their first \"job\" as a staff surgeon. While this precious developmental time for senior residents is currently threatened, there may be a competing interest of assuring that the \"outgoing\" residents have received all of their necessary training, even if that means a time extension for their training, while minimizing the potential detrimental effect of this increased resident complement on the \"incoming\" or junior residents. Certainly, the delay in surgical training will be widespread and the effect thereof felt throughout surgical training, regardless of post graduate year. It is safe to assume that during this break in routine training, every resident will be impacted to varying degrees.",

Rapidly developing percutaneous technology such as angioplasty, drug eluding stents, atrial septal defect closure devices and transcatheter aortic valve replacements are some examples that have replaced many \"open\" straightforward operations. In addition, there is an expectation by the public for institution/program transparency with increased public reporting and, associated with it, mounting scrutiny on surgical outcomes 3 .

In addition, simulation requires ownership with maintenance of equipment and a significant time commitment by faculty. The \"Top Gun\" program demonstrated that simulation practice leads to improved skills performance for CT surgery trainees. 9 Other programs such as the Thoracic Surgery Directors Association (TSDA) Boot Camp have favorable reviews from residents but have limited enrollment availability. Surgical coaching programs that focus on individual continuous improvement of technical and non-technical skills such as leadership, teamwork and communication provide excellent resources and promote performance improvement in the operating room. 10 Lastly, there is ample evidence that videotaping of operative cases provides valuable data on technical skills and communication skills between faculty, operating room staff and trainees. 11, 12 Such assessments may be limited due to hospital resources, feasibility, time, cost, bias and adequate review. 12 It is imperative to explore ways to make these resources more widely available and affordable.",
