As the availability and speed of SARS-CoV-34 2 testing platforms improve, results of these tests are increasingly relied upon to inform critical decisions 35 related to therapeutic intervention, use of personal protective equipment, patient isolation, and workforce36 readiness. While the analytic performance of SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 37 reaction (RT-PCR) tests are well described[1], clinical performance is impacted by several factors that are 38 difficult to measure, such as low levels of shedding during incubation and early infection[2], variability in 39 the site of specimen acquisition[3,4], and sufficiency of sample collected. In addition, early reports and 40 characterizations in the press have left the medical community and general public with concerns about the 41 reliability of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing and the interpretation of negative results. Data characterizing 42 the scope of false negative results observed in the context of current US testing practices are needed to 43 guide clinical protocols and inform the public, but are lacking. 44 45 The initial US introduction of COVID-19 through Washington State[5] followed closely by Northern 46 California[6], combined with the early availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing in both regions[7,8], provides 47 an opportunity to evaluate clinical test performance in a population of repeatedly tested patients.
