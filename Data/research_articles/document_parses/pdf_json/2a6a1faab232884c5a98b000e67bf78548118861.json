Timely identification and management of DCI are crucial to improving outcomes in patients with SAH [2]. However, diagnosing DCI remains challenging. Multiple confounders may present as worsening of the neurologic examination, potentially delaying recognition of underlying DCI. Moreover, confounders may hinder efforts to monitor the clinical response to a chosen therapy. Here, we present the case of a patient with SAH in whom the use of CT perfusion (CTP) scans was used to diagnose and subsequently manage DCI in the setting of multiple confounders.",

Nimoidipine and leviteracetem had been continued since her admission. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) was raised with a norepinephrine infusion to 140-160 mm Hg (a 25% increase from her baseline SBP) for management of suspected DCI. Importantly, the upper SBP limit was set at 160 mm Hg in an attempt to balance cerebral perfusion with cardiac stress. Her troponin I had risen from 16.5 ng/mL on presentation to 32.2 ng/ mL at its peak on post-ictus day 1. ECGs demonstrated diffuse ST-segment depressions.

Since it remained unclear whether subclinical seizures, infection, or DCI were responsible for this change, a CT brain, CTA, and CT perfusion (CTP) were requested, with the goal of evaluating for perfusion mismatch with CTP. Her CT showed a new infarct in the left anterior cerebral artery territory, and CTA showed severe narrowing of the anterior cerebral artery A2 segments (Fig. 2) . CTP showed elevated Tmax (time to the maximum of the residue function) in the anterior cerebral artery territory bilaterally with a 40 mL volume of tissue exceeding the Tmax threshold of 6 s (Fig. 3a) . Prior studies have shown that a Tmax delay of greater than 6 s is a good predictor of critically hypoperfused tissue that will infarct in the absence of timely reperfusion in stroke patients [3, 4] . Although the plain CT showed an infarct and CTA showed severe vasospasm, it would have remained unclear whether there was further tissue at risk or whether the stroke had been completed. However, due to the large mismatch seen on CTP, a trial of increased SBP targets of 160-200 mm Hg was initiated and the norepinephrine infusion was then titrated to the lowest level required to improve the neurological deficit. By this time, her troponin had trended down to 0.65 ng/ mL. Her cardiac biomarkers were repeated daily along with a repeat echocardiogram during the increase in vasoactive medications. A milrinone infusion was also initiated at 1 mcg/kg/min based on preliminary evidence of benefit in treatment of DCI [5] . By maintaining her SBP 160-170 mmHg, her neurological examination improved to consistently obeying, with 4/5 power in hip flexion and knee extension bilaterally compared to 3/5 bilaterally the day before.",

Review of the CTA showed that the area of vasospasm was too distal to permit safe angioplasty, and the decision was therefore made to continue medical management with induced hypertension (IH) and milrinone. The INR team requested a repeat CTA/CTP after 24 h to follow up on the vasospasm progression. Our INR colleagues would have considered performing chemical angioplasty if persistent vasospasm and increased perfusion mismatch were present. However, despite persistent vasospasm, cerebral angioplasty was not offered due to improved perfusion mismatch. The CTA showed possible mild improvement in the caliber of the anterior cerebral arteries. More impressively, the CTP showed substantial reduction in the volume of tissue with Tmax > 6 s to 4 mL (Fig. 3b ), indicating that she had improved perfusion with reduced tissue at risk. IH and milrinone were continued. A final CTA/CTP scan was requested the following day due to persistent and increasing agitation, raising concern for progression of ACA territory DCI rather than the default culprit of ICU delirium. Reassuringly, the repeat CTP showed complete resolution of the perfusion abnormality with volume of tissue with Tmax > 6 s reduced to 0 mL (Fig. 3c ). The patient's level of consciousness improved, no further fluctuations in her neurological examination were observed, and her lower limb motor examination improved from 3/5 to 4/5 for hip flexion on the left and from 2/5 to 4/5 on the right. The patient's kidney function remained stable with repeat contrast exposures. Milrinone and norepinephrine were weaned at day 14 of admission, outside of the time window for DCI and after finding radiographic resolution of perfusion mismatch and vasospasm on the final CTP. The patient was transferred to the neurosurgical ward on day 18, with eventual discharge from hospital on day 34. An MRI obtained 3 weeks after SAH (Fig. 4) showed the small infarct in the left anterior cerebral artery territory, and edema around the right-sided ventricular drainage catheter tract, but no subsequent infarction in the anterior cerebral artery territories.",

            "text": "New insights into the pathophysiology of DCI suggest that it may result from a combination of microthrombosis, cortical spreading depolarizations, and microcirculatory dysfunction [8, 9] . These changes may not be captured by large-vessel imaging modalities and could explain the finding that DCI often exists in the absence of vasospasm [8] . Moreover, up to 70% of patients will demonstrate vasospasm with conventional imaging (e.g., CTA) yet only approximately 30% will develop delayed neurological deficits due to DCI [10] , highlighting the important concept that vessel narrowing alone may not be clinically relevant, whereas clinical deterioration may occur despite a normal CTA scan. CT perfusion (CTP) is an emerging and attractive imaging modality to detect cerebral ischemia because it overcomes several of the previous limitations [11, 12] . CTP may show microcirculatory disturbances not evident on plain CT, CTA, or DSA [13] and may additionally identify ischemic tissues remote from the site of large-vessel spasm. CTP scans may also assist with monitoring response to therapy for DCI. For example, a decrement in the area of ischemia between two CTP scans obtained during treatment with vasoactive medications could indicate physiological responsiveness, and a possible benefit to continuing therapy. Obtaining CTAs for this purpose may not be sufficient, especially in the presence of confounders, since improvement in vessel caliber alone may or may not signify an improvement in perfusion, and if it does, the findings may be disproportionate (this was the case between our patient's first and second CTA). Furthermore, at many centers screening for vasospasm commonly occurs with TCD or TCCD ultrasonography. However, this monitoring modality is affected by Fig. 3 Serial CT perfusion maps and CT angiography during milrinone and induced hypertensive therapy. Perfusion map before milrinone and hypertensive treatment, a (8 days after presentation) shows increased Tmax (top row) in the anterior cerebral artery territories bilaterally. Using a threshold of Tmax > 6 s, there is 40 mL of tissue with abnormal perfusion (bottom row). CTA shows severe narrowing of the anterior cerebral artery A2 segments (arrow). Perfusion map after initiation of milrinone and induced hypertension, b (9 days after presentation) shows reduced extent and severity of the Tmax elevation (top row), and 4 mL of tissue with abnormal perfusion (bottom row). CTA shows possibly mild improvement in the caliber of the anterior cerebral arteries (arrow). Perfusion map 48 h after initiation of milrinone and induced hypertension at 10 days, c shows complete normalization of Tmax, and no tissue with abnormal perfusion (bottom row). CTA shows no change in the caliber of the anterior cerebral artery A2 segments (arrow) multiple variables (e.g., skull thickness, vessel anatomy), is highly operator-dependent, has poor predictive characteristics for vasospasm outside the middle cerebral artery, and (while it may be specific for vasospasm) does not directly translate into a high risk of DCI [14, 15] . CTP may have several advantages over TCD because it provides a more nuanced assessment of blood flow derangements and may help predict DCI when used early, or may identify DCI later in the admission.",

CTP may allow clinicians to tease apart the contribution of DCI to the neurologic deterioration, and provide justification for initiating therapies which carry risk (e.g., vasopressors and inotropes). A final advantage of CTP relates to patients with poor grade SAH. For example, if vasospasm is detected incidentally (e.g., by TCD or CTA alone), it may not be possible to decide whether this is a clinically relevant finding or an epiphenomenon, since the clinical examination is unlikely to change from baseline [1] . Here, again, CTP may allow clinicians to make the distinction and potentially consider treatment if ischemia is detected due to perfusion mismatch.",

Thresholds for abnormal limits of cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, mean transit time (MTT), and Tmax have not been firmly established for the diagnosis of DCI, and while small, single-center studies have suggested possible values [11, 12] , these have not been validated with larger patient samples. Furthermore, obtaining high-quality CTP scans involves important technical considerations relating to image acquisition and postprocessing which may be challenging to standardize [16] . Finally, each additional scan exposes the patient to a radiation burden between 1.1 and 5.0 mSv [17] ; a dose of 5.0 mSv may increase the risk of cancer by 0.025% compared to unexposed individuals [17] . In light of these limitations, careful selection of patients is necessary to minimize inappropriate use of this technology. Patients likely to benefit may be those at high risk of DCI, and in whom the clinical examination or other investigations (e.g., cEEG, serial TCDs) are non-diagnostic. Furthermore, CTP should not be obtained without a comprehensive workup of confounders, since evaluation often reveals metabolic or structural causes for neurologic deterioration. Finally, the decision to obtain CTP must also carefully weigh the risks of additional radiation and contrast burden to the patient.",
