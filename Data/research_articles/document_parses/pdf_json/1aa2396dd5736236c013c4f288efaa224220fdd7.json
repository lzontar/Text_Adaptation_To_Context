This prospective cohort study that was conducted by the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, together with the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China to monitor COVID-19 cases have collected and analyzed 2007 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions [1] . In this study, cancer was 3 times higher among COVID-19 patients, compared to the overall Chinese population [1] , with a prevalence of 2.2%, which is 1.7 times higher than that of the Chinese population of the same age according to the International Agency for research on cancer [2] . Patients with cancer have also been found to have more severe symptoms with COVID-19, compared to non-cancer patients; Yang and colleagues [3] observed worsening acute respiratory syndrome in COVID cancer patients. Similarly, Whehua and associates [1] observed that the percentage of patients being admitted to intensive care units requiring ventilation, or ultimately dying, was 39% compared to 8% in non-cancer patients (p=0.0003).",
