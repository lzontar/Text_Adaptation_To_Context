COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines.

Differences in some symptoms and CT findings were found also when comparing patients with cancer with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (table 2) . When comparing biochemical indexes of COVID-19 between patients with and without cancer, we found that pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-2R were higher in patients with cancer than in those without cancer. Infection-related biomarkers procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were also higher in patients with cancer. In terms of immune cells, the decline of lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T -cell counts, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells were more pronounced in patients with cancer (table 1) . Additionally, there was greater evidence of multiple-organ damage in patients with cancer compared with those without cancer, since patients with cancer presented with higher levels of neutrophils, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and hs-cTnI, whereas eosinophils, albumin, globulin, and total protein were decreased (table 1) . Furthermore, coagulation-related indicators, such as falling platelet counts and prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were also pronounced in patients with cancer (table 1) . Notably, aggravated inflammatory responses, lymphopenia, and multiple-organ damage, especially decreased albumin-globulin ratio and elevated NT-proBNP, were more pronounced in patients with cancer who had severe COVID-19 compared with those with non-severe disease (table 2). Other laboratory indices or organ damage biomarkers in both patients with and without cancer, as well as patients with cancer and severe or non-severe COVID-19, are presented in the appendix (pp [11] [12] .",

We found that TNF-\u03b1, NT-proBNP, albumin-globulin ratio, and CD4+ T cells were also associated with the risk of death from COVID-19 (appendix p 16), and the dynamic change of these four indices over follow-up are shown in the appendix (p 20).

            "text": "Here, by integrating clinical data from nine hospitals, we found that patients with cancer infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19. Furthermore, in addition to previously reported risk factors for this population, such as older age and elevated IL-6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, we identified novel risk factors including advanced tumour stage, elevated TNF-\u03b1 and NT-proBNP, and decreased CD4+ T cells and albumin-globulin ratio. Our enrolled patients without cancer were statistically matched to those with cancer, which helped to minimise the effects of common confounders such as age, sex, and other comorbidities on the severity of COVID-19. The lower prevalence of sore throat and coryza and increased prevalence of dyspnoea and expectoration in patients with cancer compared with those without cancer are in line with the findings of previous studies, 13 and might be due to patients' subjective perception of their disease severity. Moreover, in most situations, CT images of chest lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneu monia is explicitly different from those of lung cancer or metastasis in distribution, density, and size. 14 Notably, all patients in our current study were symptomatic for COVID-19; therefore, a screening or an epidemiological study in the patients with cancer is warranted to understand the rate of asymptomatic infection.",

Risk factors reported previously in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated IL-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein; and decreased lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. Additionally, we identified several risk factors for COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer, including advanced tumour stage, elevated TNF-\u03b1 and NT-proBNP, and decreased CD4+ T cells and albumin-globulin ratio. Older age has previously been reported as an important independent predictor of mortality in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19. [15] [16] [17] Moreover, we observed that advanced tumour stage aggravates COVID-19 progression, which might be due to the tumour burden. Among the measured cytokines, elevation of IL-6 was most pronounced, consistent with recent published studies. 18, 19 It is known that IL-6 plays multifaceted roles in regulation of vascular leakage, complement activation, and coagu lation pathways, which ultimately causes poor outcomes for acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and SARS. [20] [21] [22] TNF-\u03b1, a potential novel biomarker for COVID-19 identified here, has been reported to facilitate the apoptosis of both lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells, ultimately resulting in vascular leakage, alveolar oedema, and hypoxia. 23 TNF-\u03b1 has also been reported to mediate airway hyper-responsiveness and pathogenesis in influenza and SARS-CoV infection. 24 Additionally, TNF-\u03b1 was originally identified as an effective mediator inducing haemorrhagic necrosis in tumours. 25 Collectively, these findings help to explain our results showing that TNF-\u03b1, compared with indicators such as C-reactive protein and D-dimer, might be more predictive for COVID-19 severity, especially in patients with cancer. Reduced CD4+ T cells in patients with COVID-19 has been confirmed by Qin and colleagues, revealing that an immunosuppression feature is pronounced in severe COVID-19 cases. 19 A rapid and well coordinated innate immune response is the first line of defence against viral infections. CD4+ T cells can enhance the ability of cytotoxic T cells to clear pathogens. 26 However, persistent stimulation by the virus might induce T-cell exhaustion and facilitate host immune response disorders, causing excessive inflammation and even death. 23, 27 Notably, in addition to dysregulated inflammatory and immune responses, organ damage biomarkers such as elevated NT-proBNP and decreased albumin-globulin ratio, were also associated with COVID-19 severity, as has been confirmed by other studies. 28 Collectively, these findings suggest that aggravated inflammatory storm, dys regulated immune responses, and multiple-organ damage appear to be possible mechanisms in patients with cancer with severe COVID-19.",

Here, we found that clinical interventions, especially ventilation treatments (high-flow nasal cannula oxygen or mechanical ventilation), were more intensive in patients with cancer than in patients without cancer. In particular, more than 75% of patients with cancer and COVID-19 received antiviral treatment and antibiotics, and approximately a third of patients received immunomodulators. Several clinical trials are underway to define potential roles for antiviral agents (remdesivir, lopinavir, or ritonavir) 29 and specific immunomodulators such as IL-6 receptor blockade (tocilizumab; ChiCTR2000029765) in COVID-19. Interactions between several chemotherapy agents and antiviral drugs need to be considered when treating patients with cancer and COVID-19; 30 the sample size in our study was too small to permit this analysis. In view of the uncontrolled inflammatory responses, impaired adaptive immune responses, and multipleorgan dysfunction in patients with cancer and COVID-19-especially those with severe COVID-19-the current management of COVID-19 should be focused on inflammatory reaction and immune dysfunction, supportive care including ventilatory sup port, and treatment of complications.",
