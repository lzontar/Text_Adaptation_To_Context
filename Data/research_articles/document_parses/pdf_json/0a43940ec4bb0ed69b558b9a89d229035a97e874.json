On oceanic islands, the ecology of IAV could be affected by the relative diversity, abundance and density of seabirds and ducks. Seabirds are the most abundant and widespread avifauna in the Western Indian Ocean and, in this region, oceanic islands represent major breeding sites for a large diversity of potential IAV host species. Based on serological assays, we assessed the host range of IAV and the virus subtype diversity in terns of the islands of the Western Indian Ocean. We further investigated the spatial variation in virus transmission patterns between islands and identified the origin of circulating viruses using a molecular approach. Our findings indicate that terns represent a major host for IAV on oceanic islands, not only for seabird-related virus subtypes such as H16, but also for those commonly isolated in wild and domestic ducks (H3, H6, H9, H12 subtypes) . We also identified strong species-associated variation in virus exposure that may be associated to differences in the ecology and behaviour of terns. We discuss the role of tern migrations in the spread of viruses to and between oceanic islands, in particular for the H2 and H9 IAV subtypes.",

The emergence of the H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 virus subtypes in domestic birds in southeastern Asia, as well as the introduction of the swine-origin H1N1 virus in human populations, have demonstrated the ability of IAV to spread beyond species barriers and to adapt rapidly to new hosts and environmental conditions [7] [8] [9] . Over the past decade, ducks have been extensively studied and recognized as important hosts for IAV ecology. Other groups of birds, such as shorebirds and seabirds, are also often infected with IAV, but the epidemiological position that these hosts occupy between wild ducks, domestic birds and humans is not well understood [10] .",

In addition to spatial isolation, the small duck community size could limit opportunities for virus transmission and also negatively affect virus subtype diversity on these islands (ducks are the natural hosts for 14 of the 16 described hemagglutinin subtypes of avian IAV; [6] ). Seabird migration and breeding behaviour could favour virus dispersal over long distances and transmission patterns within and between colonies.

On these islands, seabird communities are highly heterogeneous in term of species richness, population size and density (S1 Table) . To take into account this heterogeneity, our sampling strategy was designed to provide representative numbers of samples as a function of colony size and to include a maximum number of species on each island. For instance, eight seabird species breed on Europa, with population size ranging from ten to hundreds of thousands of breeding pairs (S1 Table; [15]). On this island, five of the eight breeding species were sampled and sample size was adjusted to be representative of the population size of each species (S2 Table) . This sampling strategy was modified as needed related to local geographic, safety and ethical constraints that restrict access to bird colonies, such as in highly mountainous regions (e.g. on Reunion Island) or for species highly sensitive to human disturbance (e.g. frigatebirds).",

Prior to transfer, MDCK plates were washed twice with DPBS (150 \u03bcL per well) and media in each well was replaced with 150 \u03bcL of trypsin-supplemented MEM (as described above). Examination for cytopathic effects was performed with light microscopy; samples were considered positive when no cytopathic effect was observed. A single well without antigen was included for each sample to test for toxicity. In addition, a positive and negative well (MEM only) was run for each antigen and all antigens were back titrated to confirm the proper dilution. Positive reference antisera for the 16 HA subtypes were provided by National Veterinary Services Laboratory, APHIS, USDA.",

Secondly, as North American IAV isolates were used as reference viruses in the VN and HI assays (except for H15), we cannot exclude that they may be antigenically different to IAV circulating in the Western Indian Ocean, and this may have resulted in underestimating subtype prevalence.

For instance, Sooty terns breed in colonies of hundreds of thousands of pairs, with high bird densities [13] , potentially generating optimal conditions for virus transmission. Yet, in our study, IAV were not directly detected and the seroprevalence was relatively low in these breeding colonies which in some cases were composed of more than a million pairs and very high nest densities (e.g. six nests per square meter on Bird Island [36] ). A potential relationship between nest density and seroprevalence might nevertheless exist because higher prevalences were measured on Bird Island and Juan de Nova, where nest density was higher than on Aride and Europa (less than two nests per square meter). This potential trend needs to be validated by taking into account inter-annual variation as well as intra-colony differences in nest density.",

In contrast, brown and lesser noddies tend to visit and roost on a large number of islands in the Indian Ocean after the breeding season [37] . These postbreeding roosting sites may favor high contact rates within and between species, which could favor virus transmission. Although further research is necessary on these aspects, our findings indicate that differences in the ecology and behaviour of closely related tern species could significantly affect virus exposure and transmission opportunities.

This is suggested by the significant differences in seroprevalences estimated at different time of the year, in the populations of lesser noddies sampled on Bird and Reunion islands. In a recent study, Verhagen et al. reported very high prevalence of infections (up to 72%) in nesting and fledging black-headed gulls [38] . The authors did not detect virus in the adults they sampled throughout the course of the breeding season, but seroprevalence in these birds reached about 40% [38] . In our study, higher seroprevalence was found in lesser noddies on Reunion Island (78.9 \u00b1 10.6%), where sampling was conducted in a roosting site during the post-breeding migration, than on Bird Island (52.9 \u00b1 8.3%), where sampling was performed during the breeding season. This pattern suggests that, in addition to spatial variation, a strong temporal variation associated to the host life cycle may affect virus transmission opportunities. The high prevalence of infection we report on Reunion Island (27.6 \u00b1 11.5%) highlights that transmission may occur preferentially on roosting sites rather than on breeding colonies and further supports that significant temporal as well as age-associated variations in virus infection could exist for seabirds.",

In wild ducks, co-infections with different virus subtypes frequently occur [40] , resulting in high rates of genetic reassortment without clear patterns of gene segment association or virus fitness costs [41] [42] [43] . In gulls, high intercontinental virus gene exchange has been reported suggesting that seabirds could represent important vectors for geographically reassorted viruses [39] . It remains unknown whether co-infection frequently occurs in noddies, or if the detection of antibodies against multiple IAV subtypes results from sequential infections.

The detection of IAV subtypes usually associated with wild ducks and poultry (H3, H6, H9, H12) further suggests that noddies might share habitats with ducks at some stage during their life cycle. Mixing between species and populations originating from different geographic areas favour virus gene flow between hosts and facilitates cross-species transmission, in particular during the course of migration [44, 45] and, for pelagic birds, in wintering areas [46, 47] .

The Garganey (Anas querquedula) is also present on the eastern coast of Africa and is an occasional non-breeding visitor to several Western Indian Ocean islands [12] . This long-distance migrant is a major host for IAV [49] [50] [51] [52] ; one could thus hypothesize that it may be involved in intercontinental virus gene flow from the Northern to the Southern hemisphere.

Genetic analyses indeed showed that the virus detected on Reunion Island was closely related to H2 IAV isolated in black-headed gulls in the Republic of Georgia, and suggested that this virus might have been introduced to the Western Indian Ocean by long-distance migrants in the East-Asia-East-Africa or Black Sea-Mediterranean migratory flyway. Overlap between the spatial ranges of black-headed gulls and noddies could have favoured direct virus transmission of this virus subtype, usually isolated in ducks. The limited information on IAV circulation in wild birds in Eastern Africa, as well as the limited knowledge on seabird migrations in this area, however, precludes a more precise conclusion on the geographic and host origins of the Reunion Island viruses.",

The H9 IAV subtype is relatively uncommon in wild ducks [54, 55] and has occasionally been found in seabirds and shorebirds (e.g. [56, 57] ). The H9N2 virus subtype has been circulating in poultry in Asia since the mid-1990s [58] and was identified as being the donor of the internal segments of the Asian strains of the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses [9, 59] . This virus subtype has also been responsible for infections in humans [60] , and has been reported as the predominant virus subtype in poultry and live-bird markets, between 2008 and 2011 in Bangladesh [61, 62] and in 2003 and 2004 in India [63] . Interestingly, recent studies have revealed that sooty terns from Bird Island spend long periods of time in the Bay of Bengal during their post-breeding migration [64] . Although it remains unclear if prolonged activities of sooty terns in this region could have led to infection with H9N2 viruses circulating in poultry, this finding nevertheless supports that terns may regularly be infected with virus subtypes that are considered at threat to veterinary and human health. Future isolation and genetic analyses of H9 IAV subtypes infecting sooty terns will provide precise information on potential gene flows between Southern Asia and the Western Indian Ocean.",
