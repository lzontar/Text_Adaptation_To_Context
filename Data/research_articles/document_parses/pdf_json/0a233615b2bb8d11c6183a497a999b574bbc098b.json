This reported prevalence is likely to be substantially underestimated, particularly given the increased recognition of interstitial lung diseases in the pediatric population in recent years, due to: (1) a recently developed classifi cation system for categorizing pediatric interstitial lung disease; (2) increased recognition particularly of the unique interstitial lung diseases which occur in infants; and (3) increased use of thoracoscopic lung biopsy in pediatric patients for defi nitive diagnosis.

First, there has been substantial confusion and diffi culty associated with the description and classifi cation of specifi c interstitial lung diseases in infants and young children with multiple terms used for similar abnormalities and sometimes the same term used for differing conditions; and there has been a tendency to attempt to fi t these pediatric disorders into the diagnostic schema used for adults. As the adult ILD classifi cation became more refi ned and as more knowledge was gained about certain forms of infant ILD, it became clear that using the adult classifi cation was both suboptimal and limiting as conditions common in adults are rare or nonexistent in infants and children and recently recognized infant conditions have no place in the adult classifi cation. Second, the adult ILD classifi cation system did not acknowledge the important role of heritable and genetic disorders that have become widely recognized as an important component of ChILD. The recognition of the role of genetic disorders of the surfactant system was pivotal in changing this understanding. And, now genetic underpinnings are being sought for a wider group of ChILD. Classifying ILD in the pediatric patient based on the adult ILD classifi cation system is no longer a viable approach.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ".3.1 Rationale and History Behind the Development of the New Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease Classifi cation"}, {"text": "Recognition of the substantial differences between pediatric and adult ILD led to the evolution of the current and evolving classifi cation system for ChILD. A European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force addressed this issue in a retrospective review of 185 pediatric cases of chronic interstitial lung disease in immunocompetent patients; most, but not all, had lung biopsy and histologic material which was not reviewed as part of this project; the diagnoses made at initial examination were accepted. The ERS review divided the diagnoses made clinically into four categories based on a proposal by Fan and Langston [ 6 ] :", "cite_spans": [{"start": 620, "end": 625, "text": "[ 6 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History"}, {"text": "(1) Diffuse lung parenchymal disease of unknown association (drug reaction, aspiration, connective tissue disorders, infection, environmental disorders);", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "History"}, {"text": "(2) idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (nonspecifi c interstitial pneumonia [NSIP] ), cellular/fi brotic, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP), diffuse alveolar damage/acute interstitial pneumonia (DAD/AIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) to include familial cryptogenic fi brosing alveolitis, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI); (3) other forms of interstitial pneumonia to include lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Langerhans cell granulomatosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), sarcoidosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, idiopathic/infantile pulmonary hemosiderosis; and (4) congenital disorders (DIP, LIP, lipoid pneumonia, NSIP/UIP, and surfactant defi ciencies). Although this concept was an important step toward improved understanding and diagnosis of ChILD, there was clearly a need for further refi nement, particularly as diagnostic criteria were not provided for these entities, disorders of immunocompromised children were not addressed, and the requirement for chronicity excluded severe and rapidly progressive conditions. Additionally, adult terminology continued to be used in large part for quite different entities including idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), conditions that are common in adults, but vanishingly rare in childhood. This study was a major advance in redirecting thinking about ChILD, and it is important for this reason, but does not truly present a new classifi cation system, nor did it resolve many of the issues leading to diagnostic confusion. A truly new classifi cation system for pediatric interstitial lung disease [ 7 ] evolved out of the recognition that clinical setting is an important consideration in the diagnosis of pediatric ILD and that combined clinical, imaging, and pathological correlation is a more powerful diagnostic tool, than any one single component. This new pediatric interstitial lung disease classifi cation system was validated for infants and very young children in a retrospective review of 186 lung biopsies done between 1999 and 2004 [ 2 ] with accompanying clinical histories and images from children under age 2 contributed by 11 pediatric institutions in North America. The importance of this new classifi cation system lies in its acknowledgment of the unique nature of ILD in infants and the overlap of other lung disorders seen in infants and young children with the varied spectrum of conditions seen in older children and adults. Based on this new classifi cation system, ChILD is classifi ed into three main groups: (1) disorders of infancy; (2) other categories (not specifi c to infancy); and (3) unclassifi able. This expandable and fl exible system for categorization has gained wide clinical recognition. This chapter uses this classifi cation scheme (Table 8 .1 ) as its organizing principal focusing initially on those disorders seen almost exclusively during infancy and not in older children or adults.

Due to their rapid clinical course of respiratory failure, most infants with this type of interstitial lung disease die during the fi rst 2 months of life despite supportive management including advanced ventilation support strategies, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and therapeutic interventions for PHT. Infants with acinar dysplasia, the rarest of these conditions, present at birth and their survival is shortest. While most reported cases are female infants, male infants may be affected as well. Those with CAD typically present within hours of birth and require continuous and often maximal supportive measures for survival with such support they may survive weeks, but cannot be weaned from these measures. Infants with ACD/MPV typically present within the fi rst few days of birth, but a few have a delayed presentation at weeks or sometimes a few months of age. Once they present, their course with respiratory failure and PHT rarely ameliorates and death by 1 month following presentation is the usual outcome. Familial cases have been reported in all and account for about 10% of ACD/MPV cases; they have been identifi ed rarely in each of the other disorders. This feature has suggested a genetic basis for all these disorders. In addition, the majority of infants with ACD/MPV have other congenital anomalies most commonly involving the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (including absence of the gallbladder), and/or genitourinary system. A search for the genetic basis of ACD/MPV has resulted in the recent recognition of mutation/microdeletion of the FOXF1 gene in a proportion of ACD/MPV cases and the recognition of familial cases highlights the need for genetic testing and counseling in cases with suspected ACD/MPV.
