We used root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE) to compare the predicted and 38 observed data, then recalculated the predictions again.",

The waves continue to follow 121 each other, until appropriate mitigation measures, prevention or treatment are implemented, or 122 the pool of the susceptible population becomes infected. This is a theoretic curve, that is 123 generally influenced by lots of other factors. 16 124 Several studies investigated the impact of different interventions with respect to minimizing 125 contact rates in the population to slow the infection spread, minimize COVID-19 mortality rates 126 and health care utilization or to suppress the epidemic per se.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are specifically 188 designed to cope with sequential input, characteristic of textual or temporal data. 22 This 189 architecture is a neural network-based architecture, that contains hidden layers chained190 according to the time step, with a possibility to predict the next sequence element(s). A time 191 series has a special temporal form, where the input to the i-th hidden layer is at the i-th time-192 step that has a corresponding x(i) observation. In its original form a simple RNN tries to predict 193 the next sequence element, however, for the purposes of the current analysis, an encoder-194 decoder variant is a more natural choice, similarly to machine translation. 25 For our specific 195 scenario this means that the during the encoder phase including time steps 1,\u2026,t the RNN is 196 fed with the already known time series data (the average of the number of new cases normalized 197 to 100 000 inhabitants for day 1\u2026t, respectively), followed by prediction in the decoder phase 198 for the future time steps t+1,\u2026,T. In our analysis T=t+1=90 days is the longest known (Hubei) 199 time interval. Since this covers quite a long data sequence, we have used gated recurring units 200 (namely Long Short-Term Memory -LSTM units) in compliance with the general 201 recommendations. 23 Figure 3 depicts our RNN architecture showing how unknown time series 202 elements are predicted. Figure 3 also shows how the information collected in the first t time-203 steps are aggregated with a fully connected (dense) neural network layer and a consequent 204regression output layer to determine a predicted number of new patients as x(t+1).(Fig 3)",

This update step is based on the general recommendations of transfer learning 211 that considers the already known time interval for the given country and re-training is done 212 in small increments of the RNN network accordingly. 26 Thus we start predicting the first 213 unknown element x(t+1) from the last 5% of the known data, and the same principle is 214 applied to each subsequent element. Moreover, after each prediction step our RNN 215 architecture is re-trained and the subsequent elements are predicted with this updated RNN.
