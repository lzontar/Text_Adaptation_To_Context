The world-wide standard for pasteurization, according to the International Dairy Federation, is either a 'low-temperature-long-time' treatment (at least 63\u00b0C for 30 minutes; batch pasteurization) or a 'high-temperature-short-time' treatment (at least 15 seconds at 72\u00b0C), or treatments with an equivalent effect (Juffs and Deeth, 2007) . These treatments effectively reduce the level of pathogenic bacteria present in milk. Sterilization of milk needs an ultra-high temperature treatment (UHT), a short time at least at 135\u00b0C, which ensures a microbiologically stable product when stored at 30\u00b0C for 15 days or for 7 days at 55\u00b0C (in closed containers).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 224, "end": 250, "text": "(NSW Food Authority, 2016;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 251, "end": 267, "text": "NVWA BuRO, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 582, "end": 605, "text": "(Juffs and Deeth, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f"}, {"text": "Furthermore, thermization is used, a sub-pasteurization process, conducted at temperatures ranging between 57 and 68\u00b0C lasting for a short time (10-20 seconds).

Furthermore, it is suggested by Gonzales-Barron et al.
