It is essential to be able to project the final extent of the epidemic to assess the healthcare resources and interventions needed to efficiently cope with the outbreak in different phases. Comprehending the prevalent trend of COVID-19 is crucial to establishing the appropriate precautions to control the epidemic spread. Different mathematical models were used to estimate the COVID-19 dynamics in the literature depending on the stage of the epidemics.

While, logistic growth model was used to estimate the COVID-19 dynamics such as the final size, maximum growth rate, peak and expected end-time. In order, to deal with the trend oscillation of COVID-19 cases in the last three months, models were developed to predict the epidemic dynamics for two scenarios embracing different phases. The first scenario covered the period between 2 nd March and 28 th May when the first peak was observed and incidence of new cases started to decline, and the model predicted the epidemic to end on August 4, 2020 if the lockdown and curfew were not interrupted. The second scenario covered the period between 29 th May and 21 st June where a sudden jump in COVID-19 new cases was witnessed due to lessening of the lockdown and non-compliance of folks to safety rules and authority guidelines upon gatherings.

It is terrifying to observe that the numbers of positive and fatality cases are increasing daily, which mandate groundbreaking means to be taken to win the battle over (21, 22, 29) . At present, there is no effective cure or vaccine for COVID-19, and NPIs and mass surveillance to early discover positive cases are the only means to mitigate and suppress the virus spread. Therefore, understanding the dynamic and trend of COVID-19 is crucial to establish the appropriate precautionary measures to limit the epidemic consequences and to avoid overwhelming healthcare facilities, especially ICUs. The interventions implemented by the Saudi government in its battle against COVID-19 since 4 th March, included social engineered distance, isolation of infected cases, quarantine of their corresponding exposed cases (case-based) and non-case based (self-hygiene and lockdown), (5, 29) .

Saudi health authority took fast actions and implemented strict precautions even before the report of the first positive case of COVID-19 on the 2 nd of March 2020, which lead to a reduction in the daily and total new cases. Consequently, less mortality was observed in Saudi Arabia, where the estimated death rate is only (0.7%) in COVID-19 positive cases, compared to other countries of about (7%),(31). It is essential to estimate the peak-time, final size and possible new cases of the epidemic to allow the health authority to take the necessary precautions, prepare the infrastructure and provide materials needed for patients in time, to cope with the different phases of the epidemic.

Especially, for the trend of COVID-19 outbreak which tended to be exponential at early phases and was directly affected by the precautionary interventions imposed by the government and the compliance of the citizens. Consequently, Logistic Growth models have been developed in this study to give more realistic long-term forecast of COVID-19 pandemic in KSA. In order to deal with the fluctuating trend of COVID-19 incidence in the last three months, two different scenarios were depicted to predict the epidemic dynamics by mathematical models. The first scenario covered the period between 2 nd March and 28 th May when the first peak was observed around mid-May and dropped afterwards. Our analysis projected that the COVID-19 epidemic to end on the 4 th August if folks followed the recommended personal and social safety guidelines upon relaxation of curfew. The second scenario was simulated as a result of the sharp spike witnessed in the trend of the new cases on the last week of May and continue to escalate till the time of current writing-21 st June and estimated the epidemic to end on 29 th September, assuming that the NPIs will be maintained while normal life is resumed carefully. Previous reports employed Exponential Logistic and SIR models to estimating the COVID-19 dynamics in KSA in the very early phase of the epidemic before the introduction of active mass screening (6) . They utilized data until the first of April 2020, and their forecasts of the epidemic's final-size was found to be only 2064 and the pattern of recovery and mortality rates in Saudi Arabia could not be estimated, due to incomplete data at the time of their analysis (6) . The predictions given by logistic growth in our study were more realistic as it employed historical data covering longer periods with more interventions, than the one used in the previous study (6) . The results presented here in this report projected the epidemiological aspects of high concerns to health authority and the general public. It estimated trajectory trends and prevalence of the pandemic of COVIDs in the near future. Indeed, the models developed in this study could be used in the future for other infectious diseases epidemics. COVID-19 is caused by a novel virus with many unknown factors, and its epidemiology is associated with dynamic features. Mathematical Models are data driven projections, sensitive to alteration in the prevalence trend that may occur due to new mediations.

Currently, as of 21 st June 2020 more than one million individuals have been screened. Early detection of the cases was the central goal of the screening; initially, over 150 teams from the Ministry of Health conveyed the visits to crowded neighborhoods and residential complexes of workers in Makkah and Madinah. The surveillance also covers Dammam, Jeddah, and Hofuf. Initially, community active screening was conducted selectively in crowded high-risk areas that reported many COVID-19 positive cases and residential buildings with suspected cases. 82% of the cases identified through active screening were clinically asymptomatic(33). Collectively, these mediations limited the spread of Covid-19 in Saudi Arabia, and eventually, the total recoveries have surpassed the number of new cases as of the last week of May 2020. Meanwhile, healthcare infrastructure was prepared by increasing ICU units and other patient's needs to handle the epidemic waves and surges properly. Komies et al.(6) reported that the extreme 22 intervention measures imposed early by the Saudi government, led to a significant decline in the numbers of infected and mortality cases per day in Saudi Arabia compared to the UK. Subsequently, social disruption was alleviated in steps, and the lockdown of the country was eased after two months and a half(34). The reported cases reached the first observed peak on 15 th May then declined on the subsequent week which corresponds to the last week of Ramadan where partial curfew was implemented. Nonetheless, a second complete lockdown was imposed on the following week (corresponding to Eid Elfitr which preceded an incomplete lockdown and relaxation of the curfew which resulted in the sighted jump in the incidence of the new cases from 29 th May. Almost, more than three months has passed since the first reported incidence of COVID-19 in the KSA and the trend of new incidence over the last two months of April and May were observed to fluctuate remarkably with sharp spike. This could be explained in part by the introduction of active screening surveys, improvement in contact tracing and interruption of NPIs matched with intermittent episodes of relaxations. Many surges occurred during these episodes of relaxation as witnessed recently in big cities (Riyadh, Jeddah and Makkah), which led to revert to complete lockdown of Jeddah on 6 th June as excessive occupancy rates of ICUs were observed (35). Cultures and environment play a significant role in epidemics' behavior, and people tend to gather on religious and social ceremonies, which might affect the prevalence of the disease.Thus, transmission of the virus increased when people didn't abide by the rules of safety imposed by health authority guidelines specially as active screening revealed that most of the COVID-19 were asymptomatic (36). It was reported that the increase in the COVID-19 new cases observed during the last period was attributed to crowded social gatherings violating health advice and universal rules as reflected in the increase in percentages of women and children of COVID-19 positive cases. Some of these cases were linked to gathering of 30 or more people, as reveled by epidemiological investigations, which violated the precautionary rules set by KSA authorities (37). Mathematical models have always helped in short-and longterm predictions of cases and have assisted the decision-makers in their planning for the needed resources and monitoring measurements desired to control the outbreak(7,8). ARIMA and logistic growth models have been developed to model the short and long-term forecasts, respectively of COVID-19 in KSA.

The governing mathematical models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) have been utilised for short-term forecasting of COVID-19 cases with excellent results. Alzahrani et al. (15) developed an ARIMA model to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia from April 21 st to May 21 st . However, recovery and death were not included in his projections as he used data from the early phase of the outbreak till the April 21 st . Furthermore, ARIMA models have been utilised to display the trends of COVID-19's prevalence in Italy, Spain and France (16). Chintalapud et al. (17) applied AIRMA model to forecast the confirmed infected and recovered COVID-19 cases in Italy after sixty days of lockdown. Bayyurt et al.(18) has applied AIRIMA model to forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths in Italy, Spain and Turkey. Tandon et a (19) has developed an ARIMA model to forecast the COVID-19 cases in India. However, others implemented logistic growth model to estimate COVID-19 dynamics. Shen CY (10) utilised Logistic Growth model to predict the new COVID-19 cases using non-linear least square method in multiple regions in China and nations with a large amount of cases.
