The computational results complement the experimental and analytical approaches by providing a cost-effective alternative to simulating real fluid flows. For example, the visualisation capabilities such as vectors and contours of computational models are extremely useful in describing the physics that occur in observed flow results in experiments. CFPD can be used to assist in precise prediction of fluid-particle flow behaviours, particularly for drug particle delivery and inhalation toxicology where experimental methods are naturally invasive and often difficult to perform.

This is especially significant in the medical and pharmaceutical fields where invasive experimental setups that deal with human subjects are difficult to undertake. For example, during normal respiration, inhaled air often contains foreign particles such as dust, fumes and general pollutants ( Fig. 1.2 ). In addition, drug delivery via the nose and mouth involves drug particles suspended in the airflow. These flow behaviours of normal respiration and drug delivery can be simulated using the CFPD approach, which is indeed much safer and easier to perform than experimenting on a live human subject.",

For example, the frontiers of CFPD research are still in a primitive state of development, and newly developed models rely on experimental data as validation for such topics as complex multiphase flows including drug powder aggregation or deaggregation, chemical reactions, and particle breakup. With the recent increased interest in this field, more capabilities and physics will be attainable. By using CFPD models through CFD software packages, visualization of numerical solutions using vectors, contours, or animated movies of unsteady flows can have a significant impact on delivering solutions to respiratory research problems. Some of the aims of this book are to introduce to the reader the current research trends and to enable the reader to understand and be able to make the right decisions when setting up the CFPD models. In particular, new users often encounter incorrect numerically produced flow characteristics that could have been wrongly interpreted as acceptable physical phenomena. Numerical results obtained must always be thoroughly examined before they are accepted. Therefore, the new user needs to learn how to properly analyse and judge the computed results.",

            "text": "One of the many uses of CFPD is to reveal the physical nature of the interactions of particles in a fluid around and within designated objects. Fluid and particles are transported through a domain by many physical processes including dissipation, diffusion, convection, boundary layers and turbulence. The capabilities of CFPD are vast and while great advancements have been made there still remains a large undeveloped territory. CFPD, analogous to wind-tunnel and laser-photography particle analysis, can be employed as a research tool to perform numerical experiments in order to better understand the physical nature of the fluid-particle dynamics. By performing these numerical experiments, advanced models can then be developed to increase the capabilities of the computational modelling. One area of high level research activity is in the areas of atomization and sprays which are also applicable for the drug delivery devices. Models are being developed to account for the complex nature of atomization which involves a liquid phase breaking up into small droplets, which in turn experience further breakup and collisions or coagulation. Figure 1 .3 shows a snapshot in time of the unsteady atomization of a spray close to the nozzle region, which is referred to as the primary breakup. The flow structures reveal that the liquid exits the nozzle with a wave-like energy and atomizes into small droplets downstream. Following the primary breakup, the small droplets experience further atomization, which is referred to as the secondary breakup. This example illustrates how CFPD can provide detailed visualisation to better understand the observed flow structures and some important physical aspects of the fluid-particle flow, similar to a real laboratory experiment. More importantly, the simulations complement the experiments not only providing qualitative comparison but also a means to interpret some basic phenomenological aspects of the experimental condition.",

Surgical procedures can be made virtually, and then its effect on fluid flow patterns through the anatomy can be analysed. The surgeon therefore can make a more informed decision on the surgical procedure as well as devising a more effective post surgery recovery plans. One final advantage of the virtual anatomy and surgery (although not technically a training tool), is that communication between medical practitioners and the patient and their family will be improved through the visually demonstrating the anatomy and why surgery is or is not needed.",

            "text": "Pulmonary drug delivery has traditionally been used for the treatment of respiratory ailments such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. Research in this area has increased due to a number of factors including a rise in respiratory illnesses, the ability to deliver proteins and peptides, and the lung's large absorptive surface area that enables optimum bioavailability. Having said this, the physiology of the lung is not designed for systemic drug absorption but for gas exchange. The lung's defence mechanisms by either physical or mucosal clearance or breakdown by macrophages and enzymes need to be overcome for effective drug delivery. The delivered drug is usually introduced through the mouth via an atomizing delivery device. For asthma treatment these devices can be a dry powder inhaler, metered dose inhaler, or nebuliser. The drug particle is released from the device and must pass through the oral cavity, pharynx, upper airways, and preferably reach the deep lung. The main obstacle in pulmonary drug delivery is its efficacy. Inefficient drug delivery can arise, owing to excessive particle aggregation in an inhaler, early deposition in the mouth and throat, and overly rapid particle removal from the lungs by mucocilliary or phagocytic clearance mechanisms (Edwards et al. 1998), making it difficult to prolong a residence time to allow an effective drug release. The search for more effective delivery methods has been a long-time motivation for research in this pulmonary drug delivery. From a CFPD perspective, the drug delivered into the mouth involves a secondary phase material (e.g. drug particles, liquid drops, or a gaseous mixture) transported by the primary phase, air. The modelling involves many disciplines of science including the atomization of the drug formulation, fluid-particle dynamics during the particle trajectory, and finally a chemical related diffusion process at the alveolar epithelium during final absorption. CFPD studies of pulmonary drug delivery can be divided into three categories: (1) deposition in the airways, (2) drug morphology and (3) delivery device. Firstly, deposition studies in the airways (Fig. 1.5) Secondly, drug particle morphology also plays an extremely important role in the aerodynamic behaviour. Edwards et al. (1998) discusses the potential for increasing particle size but lowering the particle mass density in order to achieve large porous particles, which have less tendency to agglomerate than convectional small nonporous particles. Nano and ultrafine particles, including nanofibres, have also been cited as a potential for site specific drug delivery because of their ability to enhance drug absorption, traffic through tissues and target cells (Gelperina et al. 2005) . However, for pulmonary delivery, problems, such as stability of nanoparticles after preparation and high diffusion leading to early deposition in the mouth and throat, need to be overcome. Targeting capability is influenced by particle size, surface charge, surface modification, and hydrophobicity-characteristics which need to be considered in the particle physics. Porous nanoparticle-aggregate particles (PNAPs) (Fig. 1.6 ) are another approach which combines the aerodynamic flight ability of micron-scale porous particles with the composition of biodegradable nanoparticles that delivers the nanoparticles effectively to the lungs (Sung et al. 2009). As you will see later in Chap. 5, the particle size and, to a lesser extent, density plays a significant role in a particle's trajectory. Finally, as a further example of CFPD application for pulmonary drug delivery we present some recent research for an inhaler design. Coates et al. (2004) investigated the effects of modifying the design of the inhaler grid of a dry powder inhaler on the device performance. A variety of modelling methodologies may be used to evaluate the performance of the device and assist in characterising the dose concentration, dose variation and particle dispersion. Figure 1 .7, adapted from the work by Coates et al. (2004) , shows the velocity contours and particle tracks generated from two different inhaler grid configurations. The presence of the inhaler grid straightened the flow and reduced the level of swirl generated in the device. Particle tracking allows the frequency and location of particle impactions for the two different grid cases to be determined.",

            "text": "Research activity in nasal drug delivery has historically lagged behind pulmonary drug delivery. Today, however, there is as much interest and development in the nasal route for delivery of systemic drug formulations such as peptide and protein drugs. Its attraction is due to the large surface area of the nasal cavity that allows drug absorption. The walls are highly vascularised and the venous blood (deoxygenated a b blood returning back to the heart) from the nose passes directly into the systemic circulation leading to a rapid onset of action from the initial drug absorption. This has further advantages, including avoiding loss of drug by first-pass metabolism in the liver, fewer side effects, painless compared to injections, and the drug may even be delivered directly to the brain along the olfactory nerves (Oberd\u00f6rster et al. 2004). Similar to lung airways, the physiological function of the nose is for respiration as well as olfaction. The nose's unique geometry has defence mechanisms to prevent foreign particles from entering into the main nasal passage. Experimental studies have found that particle deposition from nasal sprays primarily occurs in the anterior third (up to the nasal valve region) of the nasal cavity (Cheng et al. 2001; Newman et al. 1998 ). CFPD research can be used in conjunction with experiments to better understand the particle dynamics and final deposition in the nasal cavity.",

Although 10 \u03bcm particles deposit more readily in the middle turbinate regions of the nasal cavity, their transport beyond the nasopharynx leads to undesirable deposition in the lungs. The fate of each particle released from specific points was achieved by individually tracking the particle's trajectory through the nasal cavity. The deposition patterns can be recorded and visualised through CFPD which helps to guide a pragmatic engineering design of the spray device or lead to better instructions for patients applying the spray (i.e. insertion at different angles, deeper insertion etc.).

This stops breathing, and the brain reacts by briefly waking the subject in order to re-open the airways and allow breathing to restart. In severe cases, a person may experience upto 600 apnoea events per night while for less severe cases the obstruction is only partial, and the airflow limitation is called hypo-apnea (Huupponen et al. 2009 ). In either case it has a significant impact on health, quality of life, and productivity. Symptoms during the night include loud snoring, choking or gasping during sleep (to get air into the lungs), and loss of sleep while long-term consequences contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness, weight gain, depression, irritability, high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke (Kiely and McNicholas 2000). The main treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP, (see Fig. 1 .9) which can be used for the management of mild and severe OSA. The airway obstruction is relieved due to the positive intraluminal pressure, produced by the CPAP device, which overcomes the collapsing pressure of the upper airway.",

Up to about 50 % of patients gave up the treatment because of some minor side effects, such as rhinitis, nasal bridge sores, discomfort, abdominal bloating, and claustrophobia. One common complaint made by patients is that the CPAP pressure is too high, leading to the discomfort (Polo et al. 1994) prior to sleep onset and increased expiratory effort as well.",

For example, numerical measurements inside the nasal cavity can identify regions of discomfort which can help future designs of CPAP devices. These measurements allow an evaluation of the CPAP device to determine whether the effects on the airflow are beneficial for preventing OSA. This can lead to improved treatment therapy planning, cost-effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, and patient use of CPAP devices. In addition, CFD studies in the pharyngeal region can also help in presurgical planning, for irreversible therapies such as tracheostomy or pharyngeal surgery. As an example a study into the flow characteristics that are produced by obstructive sleep apnea is shown (Jeong et al. 2007 ) which provides insight into the pathophysiology of the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) disease ( Fig. 1.10) . The results found that the flow in the pharyngeal airway of patients with OSA comprises a turbulent jet formed by area restriction at the velopharynx-the region in between the nasopharynx and the oropharynx as shown in Fig. 1.10 . This turbulent jet causes higher shear and pressure forces in the vicinity of the velopharynx, and it can be deduced that the most collapsible area in the pharyngeal airway of OSA patients is the velopharynx where minimum intraluminal pressure and maximum aerodynamic force lie.",

However, inhaled particles transported in the alveolar region of the lung are important for possible health risks or as a therapeutic inhaled drug therapy. Olfaction takes place in the upper regions of the main nasal passage within the nasal cavity, and this can lead to translocation of inhaled ultrafine particles to the brain. In this section we present some CFPD results in the literature firstly for the acinar airway, then for olfactory uptake. (Fig. 1.13) .

The many advantages in using computational modeling as a tool for 'virtual surgery'include the ability to explain the surgical procedure and its predicted outcome to the patient and family members; better visualization which allows the doctors to be more confident in planning the surgery; and evaluation of the potential physiological performance of the nose based on the 'virtual surgery' which facilitates a more effective post-surgical treatment plan.",

As such there has been a lot focus on ultrafine particle deposition in the lung airways (Hofmann et al. 2003; Longest and Xi 2007; Zhang et al. 2005a). CFPD studies in the lung airways may be traced back to the establishment of a single, representative lung model by Weibel (1963) and the models of Horsfield et al. (1971). These models lay the foundation for many early studies into particle deposition in the lung airways using computational and experimental approaches. The use of CFPD studies of the nasal cavity and extrathoracic airways began later than those of the lung airways and included the early work byElad et al. (1993)  who used a simplified model. A more realistic model was then studied by Keyhani (1995). Ultrafine particle deposition in the nasal cavity includes nanoparticle deposition(Wang et al. 2009; Zamankhan et al. 2006).
