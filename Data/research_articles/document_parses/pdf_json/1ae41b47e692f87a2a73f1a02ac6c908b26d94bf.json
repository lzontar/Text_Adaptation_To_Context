The goal is to handle thoracic cancer patients in a concerted and, above all, in a standardized manner. These proposals may be updated (04/10/2020) as situations arise and are incorporated into them. They must be tailored to our institutions and fluctuating resources during the COVID-19 epidemic. The proposals are based on those of the French High Council for Public Health, on published data on thoracic oncology outside the context of COVID-19, and on a concerted analysis of the risk-benefit ratio for our patients.

This will depend on the limited availability of this technique during the lockdown period. We suggest that bronchoscopy not be performed in patients whose surgery is postponed as outlined above.

Retrospective analyses suggest that the effect of postoperative chemotherapy on survival is maintained if chemotherapy is initiated 3 months after surgery. If adjuvant therapy is initiated, the following regimens should be offered to limit the risk of infection: cisplatin and vinorelbine with no D8 , or Carboplatin and -paclitaxel, once every 3 weeks and consider concomitant G-CSF (recommended given the current coronavirus situation to limit infection risks and patient visits to the hospital).",
