State-owned 193 enterprises (SOEs) created substantial employment for labor released from agriculture, following 194 spectacular productivity growth in the 1980s, but unchecked SOE expansion resulted from local 195 governments' financing enterprises via a combination of sales of land, taxation, and bank 196 borrowing, leading to questions of their efficiency and transparency.

Comparative analysis of the reforms and of state investments in India and China 221 222 The Chinese state has played a key role in addressing internal structural issues of an overall 223 strategy, secure land titles, human capital, and infrastructure, explaining China's extraordinarily 224 rapid transformation from agriculture, with unlimited supplies of labor to a modern industrial 225 state. Attributing China's superior performance mainly to market reforms, most studies 226 understate the critical role of the state, underemphasizing its lessons for lagging countries.227Lessons include long-term vision and consistency; substantial investments in public goods; and 228 experimentation, adaptation, scaling up; and evolution based on lessons learned. The implementation of the household responsibility system (HRS) in China was a \"market\" reform,230    returning collectivized land to farm households, allowing households to make farming decisions.231 HRS was followed by unprecedented rates of investments in agricultural research and 232 development (R&D) (ASTI 2019) and accompanied by physical infrastructure, education, and 233 institutional reforms in the agricultural and rural sector, directly and indirectly contributing to 234 China's extraordinary economic transformation [see supplementary Fig. A.3]. 235 236 With slowing globalization and world trade, the external and internal environments for both are 237 less favorable in 2019, than prior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). India's Economic Survey 238 (MOF, 2018, 68) noted the potential risk of a \"late converger stall\" from backlash against 239 globalization. However, The Economist (2019) has argued that causes of India's less than stellar 240 performance are domestic, that successive governments-state as well as national-have failed 241 to promote sensible, consistent policies to promote growth. China has had an exceptional record 242 of speedy design, implementation, experimentation, and learning from successes and failures of Chinese reforms: China's three-legged development strategy 246 247 China has displayed a unique blend of political centralization with economic and administrative 248 decentralization, leading it to be a strong conceptualizer and implementer of strategy. In India, 249 political will to adopt tough policies is often limited, reforms are slow to materialize and state 250 capacity to implement the policies has weakened over time (Bardhan, 2020). China's overarching, three-legged strategy is described well by Yukon Huang (2017): (1) 253 agricultural reforms starting with the household responsibility system (HRS); (2) industrial 254 reforms through town and village enterprises (TVEs) metamorphosing into a full-fledged 255 industrialization strategy, by promoting partnerships between local authorities and private 256 entrepreneurs; and (3) establishment of special economic zones (SEZs) in coastal areas, allowing 257 market forces to counter forces that previously benefited well-placed local authorities, while 258 taking steps to foster production for international trade on a highly competitive basis. Until the 259 1980s, when China became member of the Bretton Woods institutions, China was isolated.260Exports were needed to finance imports, and hence, it had a strong incentive to become export-261 oriented (World Bank 2018c) [see supplementary Fig. A.4]. 262 263 With agility, ideological flexibility, and results ranging from physical and human capital, R&D, 264 and institutional reforms of service delivery, China has pursued decentralization of development 265 to provincial and local governments to co-opt, if not overcome vested interests, in the pursuit of 266 \"bottom-up\" reforms and entrepreneurship on a large scale (Gulati and Fan, 2007; Bardhan, the important areas of reforms were in the trade sector. China's trade-weighted statutory 270 tariffs stood at 40 percent in 1992. In the next decade, before becoming a WTO member in 2001, 271 the tariffs declined to an estimated 7 percent (Huang, 2017). In a comprehensive literature review 272 and analysis of agricultural reforms in transition economies of Asia and Eastern Europe, Rozelle and Swinnen (2004) credited China's market reforms for its performance. Indeed, the narrative 274 of China's market reforms has been a consistent theme in the literature and among international 275 organizations. The World Bank illustrates the point: \"Since initiating market reforms in 1978, 276 China has shifted from a centrally planned to a more market-based economy and has experienced 277 rapid economic and social development. GDP growth has averaged nearly 10% a year-the 278 fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history-and more than 850 million people 279 have lifted themselves out of poverty\" (World Bank, 2018b).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Swinnen (2004, 405)  stressed the pragmatism of reforms, noting their gradual 282 sequencing, initially focused on reforming land rights, and attributed the success of agricultural 283 reforms to the \"the rise of incentives provided by decollectivization.\" Huang (2017) noted that 284 agrarian reforms drove the initial surge in production. Growth increased sharply in the first half 285 of the 1980s with the new HRS. Land leases also emerged, shifting user rights from collectives 286 to households. By simply allowing farmers to sell their surplus on the market, increasing 287 procurement prices, and reducing state-mandated quotas, rural per capita incomes tripled 288 between 1978 and 1984. The HRS reforms revealed spectacularly how far below the production 289 possibility frontier that Chinese farmers had been operating before its introduction. The HRS 290 contributed to a surge in GDP growth rate to 14 percent by the mid-1980s. Sicular (1994) 291 discussed the continued quota system and subsidies to grain prices in the 1980s and its gradual 292 reform in the 1990s (see, also, Gulati and Fan, 2007).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "land is not tradable, arresting the pace of the land rental market and land consolidation(Rozelle   297    andSwinnen, 2004).

Rebuilding the R&D system brought yields in line with other 308 high-performing countries.309 310 By the late 1980s, when momentum from the initial agrarian reforms was ebbing, growth was 311 given a new impetus with the emergence of rural-based TVEs. Together, these reforms helped 312 push GDP growth rates well into double digits during the first half of the 1990s.

Yet, 325 since 2000, China's support to agriculture increased substantially (Huang, et al., 2015; Huang 326 and Yang, 2017). Using OECD's standard method of estimating agricultural assistance, China's 327 agricultural producer subsidies in 2018 amounted to the subsidies of all OECD countries 328 combined (OECD 2018a, b) [see supplementary Fig. A.5]. Even considering input subsidies, 329 India's support to agriculture has been negative since 2000. Analysts have explained this 330 difference as due to China's tendency to appease rural populations given its history of rural 331 revolts compared to India's tendency to keep urban food prices low to appease urban consumers. 332 Not surprisingly, China accumulated mounting grain stocks. Year-to-year variance is 333 considerable. Grain stocks in 2017 were 71 percent of all agricultural production in China, 334 compared to 16 percent in India (AMIS 2018) [see supplementary Fig. A.6]. On average, since 335 3.2. India's import-substituting industrialization, aid dependence, and weak role for agriculture 339 in the overall development strategy 340 341 The United States and the West supported India as an antidote to Communist China. India was a 342 founding member of the non-aligned movement. With its colonial experience, Indian leadership 343 embraced an import-substituting industrialization strategy to become a great industrial power, as 344 its once thriving textile and steel industry attested to. India's first balance of payments crisis 345 (1958) led to realization within the World Bank of the growing capital needs of a rapidly 346 industrializing India, prompting the establishment in 1960, of the International Development 347 Association (IDA), the concessional window of the World Bank. Developing countries sought 348 aid through the United Nations, but Western donors opted for establishing IDA in the World 349 Bank and providing technical assistance through the United Nations Development Programme 350 (UNDP) (Lele and Goswami, 2020, forthcoming). India's second and third balance of payments 351 crises occurred in 1964-66 and at the end of the 1980s, respectively. According to Srinivasan 352 (1996), the mid-1960s crisis was a missed opportunity for reforms; but the late 1980s crisis led to 353 major internal reassessment and reform of the industrial and trade policy, led by Finance 354 Minister Manmohan Singh in the Rao Cabinet of the Congress Party (see Mohan, 2017). Until 355 the second financial crisis, the Bank's view about India was that it could do no wrong.356 357 When India's external situation began to deteriorate in 1964-1965, the World Bank mounted the 358 Bell mission, recommending a major devaluation, substantial liberalization, and abandonment of 359 the import-substituting industrialization strategy based on heavy industry, in support of light industrialization to meet the requirements of the growing food and agriculture sector. Prime Implementation of the 2006 Forest Rights Act has been slow, due to competing interests of tribal 516 populations with relatively little policy influence, environmentalists, civil society actors, and 517 those controlling mining interests (PRS, 2006). Forest-dependent people fare better in China than greater water scarcity than China. In a comparative paper on how China and India are 521 addressing water scarcities, I document that China's investments in surface irrigation are more 522 than 10 times India's, and groundwater use is controlled by a combination of new technology 523 including remote sensing, community responsibility, and rationing of water use in agriculture 524 together with change in water saving cropping patterns. India is already facing excessive 525 groundwater overdraft, and a combination of drip irrigation and solar energy calls for stronger 526 water governance at all levels (Lele, forthcoming).527 528 4.1. Public investments in agriculture 529 530China's public expenditure in agriculture reported by FAO is large.Fig. 3shows the towering 531 differences between China and India in the total gross fixed capital formation and FDI inflows in532 agriculture.

Certainly, national contexts are very different. State control 540 is stricter in unitary China. It has become conventional wisdom among China watchers that 541 accountability of the government and the party at multiple levels to deliver development 542 outcomes is greater, as the primary source of the regime's legitimacy, given the absence of 543 democratic institutions. Government takes delivering results seriously as a means of political 544 stability and indeed barring exceptions of human rights protectors, most of the population is 545 content to see improving standards of living. Effective participation of the poor in development 546 outcomes is weaker in India. Elections lend legitimacy to the party (or parties with coalition 547 governments) in power, but party competition makes it difficult to enforce regulation in India. 548 For example, restrictions on water demand or on crop burning to reduce pollution remain 549 unpopular, even as concerns grow about environmental sustainability. India's power subsidies 550 for farmers result in 30-40 percent of power and groundwater going to waste, but collective parties, is needed for agricultural science and technology: an effective extension system, 581 infrastructure, investment in human capital, and market access, involving key stakeholders-the 582 scientific community, private sector, civil society, and farming communities-taking advantage 583 of India's innovative industries, such as IT and pharmaceuticals.
