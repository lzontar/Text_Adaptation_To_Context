However, there is often a need to move beyond vegetational description and to attempt to relate these patterns to environmental variables. Despite the proliferation of numerical classificatory and ordination techniques in the last 25 years, comparatively little attention has been paid to the development of methods for relating vegetational data to external environmental variables such as soil chemistry, slope, aspect, climate, etc. (Kent & Ballard 1988) . Ter Braak (1987a: 132-136) and van Tongeren (1987: 199-203) in some way, to environmental data. Although useful in some cases, there are several important theoretical and practical limitations in these indirect approaches (ter Braak 1987a : 153-156, ter Braak & Prentice 1988 . Ter Braak has recently developed two potentially powerful numerical tools for establishing vegetation-environmental relationships. These are (1) simple discriminant functions for relating a hierarchical classification of vegetational data to external environmental information (ter Braak 1986a) , and (2) canonical correspondence analysis for deriving a multivariate direct gradient analysis where the vegetational ordination axes are constrained to be linear combinations of the environmental variables (ter Braak 1986b (ter Braak , 1987a . Both approaches are potentially useful, depending on whether the emphasis of a particular study is on classification (for example, vegetation-mapping or conservation purposes) or on ordination (for example, comparative autecological studies of particular species in a range of vegetation types).",

The ferns are Athyrium distentifolium, Matteuccia struthiopteris, and Thelypteris limbosperma, all of which can be dominant over large areas on steep hillsides in western Norway. The areas studied cover broad ecological ranges with respect to altitude, climate, and edaphic conditions. A 5m x 5m quadrat was used at each sampling point. For each quadrat all species present were given cover values according to an extended Hult-Sernander scale (Du Rietz 1921) . The value 0.5 was used for species nearby in the stand but not within the actual quadrat. The values 1-5 used are equal to the normal Hult-Sernander-Du Rietz scale.",

According to Geiger (1965: 417ff ) the amount of heat received during a day is highly dependent on the aspect. The values are highest on south-west facing slopes and lowest on north-east facing slopes. Westfacing slopes are also warmer than east-facing slopes. In this paper, aspect is given on a simple 1-8 ordinal scale, arranged to give a crude relative index of the amount of heat received by different aspects (1 = SW, 2 = S, 3 = SE, 4 = W, 5 = E, 6 = NW, 7 = N , 8 = NE) (cf.

In some stands, the humus layer (denoted by 0) was underlain by a bleached soil layer (denoted by E) which was 2-10 cm thick. In general, however, the humus layer was directly underlain by a reddish brown minerogenic soil. The humus layer from which one normally takes soil samples for analyses was often very thin (2-5 cm), and it was therefore difficult to take samples only from this layer. For comparative investigations it is essential to take samples from the same layer because chemical properties can be highly variable within a soil profile. Therefore, all the soil samples were taken from the uppermost part of the brown minerogenic soil layer. This is normally 8-14 cm below surface. Soil chemistry may also vary during the year. All samples were collected in the later part of the growing season (July-September) and kept in a refrigerator prior to chemical analyses.",

As ter Braak (1987~) discusses, it is important when interpreting the percentage of variance accounted for to realise that the aim is not loo%, as part of the variance in the data is due to noise. An ordination that explains only a low percentage of the variance can, in some circumstances be very informative. (ter Braak 1987b) . Environmental variables with long arrows are, in general, more strongly correlated with the ordination axes than those with short arrows, and so are more closely related to the pattern of vegetational variation illustrated in the ordination plot (ter Braak 1987b) . In addition, small angles between arrows may indicate a positive correlation between those variables, arrows meeting at right angles may suggest a correlation near to 0, and arrows pointing in opposite directions may reflect high negative correlation between variables (ter Braak 1987a) . Interpretation of these angles can be difficult, however, because the correlations between environmental variables are not optimised in CCA and the scaling of the axes in CCA is not strictly appropriate for representing intervariable correlations in two-dimensions (C.J.F. ter Braak, pers. comm.) . Figs 4 and 5 show the length and direction of the 17 environmental variables analysed. The longest arrows are for altitude, July and January temperatures, base saturation, CEC, K, and Ca, suggesting that these variables may represent the major environmental factors (among those measured) influencing these vegetational data. The shortest arrows are pH, loss-on-ignition, and slope. These environmental variables are thus poorly correlated with the species distribution. Interestingly, they also play a minor role in the DISCRIM results ( Fig.3) .",

Interestingly, all the environmental variables serve as indicator variables in characterking one or more division in the first four levels of the vegetational classification. At level 1 the estimated regional climatic variables constitute 40% and the measured soil variables 60% of the environmental variables. At the second level regional and local climatic variables are 58% of the indicator variables and soil variables 42%. At level 3 climate provides 54% and soil 46% of the indicator variables and at level 4 50% each are from the climatic and edaphic variables.

            "text": "The use of the discriminant-function approach presupposes that classification of the vegetational data is not only possible but also that it is desirable (cf. Webb 1954) . In many instances, particularly in broad-scale studies such as this, classification is useful and hence desirable for initial data analysis. In such cases the use of discriminant functions provides a useful tool for relating the vegetational classification to external environmental data. Van Tongeren's (1986) FLEXCLUS method may also to be useful for this purpose (see van Tongeren 1987) . The major disadvantage of using DIS-CRIM or related methods is when one has vegetational data that are essentially homogeneous and continuous and have no obvious discontinuities within the data. In such instances any classification, either numerically or non-numerically derived, is arbitrary and DISCRIM will be trying to relate environmental variables to an arbitrary classification that may not reflect at all the Tab. 4. Summary statistics of ordinations by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA): eigenvalues, percentage variance of the species abundance data accounted for, axis lengths in standard deviation units. species-environment correlations, and inter-set correlations between environmental variables and the quadrat scores. It is in such circumstances that direct gradient techniques such as canonical correspondence analysis can be most useful, as they attempt to display the relationships between individual species, individual samples, and external environmental variables. The relative lengths of the environmental-variable biplot arrows (Fig. 6 ) serve as a guide to the relative importance of the individual variables. In this case all the environmental variables appear important, with the possible exception of losson-ignition, pH, and slope. Canonical correspondence analysis is, in our experience, an extremely robust procedure and effectively analyses both homogeneous but continuously varying data and heterogeneous, discontinuous data. Its main disadvantages are that with large data sets the plots of species, samples, and environmental variables often become very crowded and difficult to comprehend and that, like any geometrical ordination method, it is attempting to summarise several dimensions of variation in a few axes. Inevitably some distortion may occur, particularly with heterogeneous data. This is exactly the situation where the combined use of TWINSPAN and DISCRIM becomes most effective.",

CCA has the bonus of providing a means of 530 implementing a simple form of direct gradient analysis of individual species in relation to selected environmental variables (e.g . Figs 4,7, 8, 9 ). Such analyses are easy to implement by means of the CANOCO program and provide a useful exploratory analysis of species responses in relation to environmental variables. These responses can then be modelled in greater detail by means of generalised linear modelling, e .g. Gaussian regression (ter Braak & Prentice 1988) .

Bkland (pers. comm.) has proposed using indirect gradient analysis, in particular DCA, to analyse these vegetational data, with rescaling of the ordination axes in compositional turnover units, and subsequent correlation of the measured environmental variables with the DCA axes. To test this proposal and to compare the relative merits of indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA) gradient approaches, we implemented D C A using CA-NOCO 3.0 (ter Braak unpubl.) with detrending by segments and default settings except that rare species were downweighted (Hill & Gauch 1980) . For comparative purposes only, this downweighting option was used here in CCA, even though it was not used in CCA analyses discussed above. Summary statistics of the analyses are given in Tab. 4. As expected the eigenvalues and axis lengths (in standard deviation units) are slightly smaller in CCA than in DCA because of the constraints imposed by the environmental variables in CCA. The multiple correlations (= species-environment correlation) are all correspondingly higher in CCA than for DCA. The DCA and CCA ordination plots are very similar, not surprisingly as the species-environment correlations obtained in DCA and subsequent regression of quadrat scores on axes 1 and 2 on the environment variables (0.83, 0.87 respectively) are high. If this regression is implemented within the ordination, as in CCA, the correlations increase to 0.88 and 0.90 respectively. We conclude from these high correlations that the measured environmental variables account for the major patterns of variation in the vegetational data.",

Direct CCA techniques result in higher species-environment correlations and higher correlations between many of the individual environmental variables and the ordination axes (Tab. 4). Indeed the strikingly larger species-environment correlation for CCA axis 3 (0.85 cf. 0.60 in DCA) (and for axis 4, 0.86 for CCA, 0.61 for DCA) confirms ter Braak's (1987a: 136-137) suggestion concerning the serious limitations of using indirect gradient analysis followed by interpretation in terms of environmental gradients. We concur with ter Braak & Prentice's (1988) view that indirect \"ordination is the tool for exploratory analysis of community data with no prior information about the environment\", whereas direct \"constrained ordination is the equivalent tool for the analysis of community variation in relation to environment\".",

Climate and soil factors are most closely correlated with the vegetational classification and with species distributions within the ordination plots. The ferns T. limbosperma, A. distentijolium, and M. struthiopteris appear to be ecologically well separated. T. lirnhosperma-dominated stands are mainly characterised by low soil fertility, high January temperatures, and high humidity. The separation of floristically different groups within this dominance-type is mainly correlated with differences in altitude and oceanicity (January temperature). The main variation within the A. distentifolium-dominated group is closely correlated with soil fertility. Edaphically the poorest A. distentifolium stands are similar to the richest T. limbosperma stands. They are, however, very seldom mixed in the same stand, and this is probably due to snow conditions. M. struthiopteris is associated with high soil fertility and high summer temperatures.",

They extend the usefulness and ecological power of numerical classification and ordination, respectively. They both help to explore the relationships between species, quadrats, and external environmental variables and provide a guide to the interpretation of these relationships. Both methods can analyse environmental data originally recorded as binary, nominal, ordinal, or continuous variables and as mixed variable types although careful considerations must be given to questions of appropriate transformation and coding (see ter Braak 1982 ter Braak , 1986a ter Braak , 1987a . Crude estimates of grazing on a 1, 2, 3 scale or land-use types on a 110 basis can thus be analysed (after appropriate recoding) by these methods as well as variables such as soil pH or altitude measured on a continuous scale. These methods clearly have much potential. They provide useful, complementary techniques for ecologists interested in looking beyond vegetation description to questions of species-vegetation-environmental relationships.
