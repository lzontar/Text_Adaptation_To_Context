In order to do so, it is necessary to share procedures that can be implemented in the whole Country (Italy). The goal is to avoid deepening the disparities of mental health resources within Regions or resistances to deliver appropriate mental health care.",

However, several lines of evidences support this decision, whenever supplies allow for its implementation. Subjects diagnosed with a mental illness have a life expectancy 15-20 years shorter compared to the general population (Nordentoft et al., 2013) . The degree of risk of COVID-19 transmission within individuals with a severe mental illness is still unknown; however, it is reasonable to presume this risk is higher than that in the general population, because of persistent unhealthy behaviours and lifestyles. It is well known, for example, that this fragile population suffers from higher rates of respiratory diseases (Joukamaa et al., 2001) (because, in part, of the higher prevalence of cigarette smokers (Lasser et al., 2000) ). Moreover, almost 15% of the patients currently treated by the community mental health care system had at least one admission to medium and long-term inpatient facilities during the previous year (Ministero della Salute, 2018), with the subsequent risk of acquiring nosocomial respiratory infections (Fukuta and Muder, 2013) .",

Moreover, the mental health professional will stress the continued availability of acute services, in case of an emergency, during open hours (which will stay the same, resources permitting). (3) The scheduled appointment should be maintained in the following scenarios: (a) critical clinical situation, as assessed during previous visits or the phone check-in mentioned in point 1, and reported by the patient or caregivers (e.g. current exacerbation of symptoms, manifestation of new side effects, lack of adherence to the pharmacological treatment); (b) the necessity to administer pharmacological therapy at the centre (e.g. long-acting medications, direct observed therapy); (c) legal obligations (mandated to care). (4) Scheduled appointments can be postponed in the following scenarios: (a) clinically stable conditions; (b) patients with pre-existent vulnerable physical health conditions; (c) ascertained good adherence to treatment; (d) presence of supporting family; (e) preference expressed by the patient of phone/ video call. If a patient is mandated to care (legal obligation), the designated professional will offer alternatives to in-person assessment to the judicial authority. (5) At the end of the phone call, the designated professional and the patient will agree on the frequency of follow-up phone/ video calls which will be recorded in the electronic medical records and the professional's calendar. Services should implement an adequate telemedicine software both on telephones and laptops/computers accessible to all professionals. (6) The phone check-ins (point 1) can trigger a sense of abandonment to some of our patients. Please ensure that the patient understands that those phone calls are intended to reduce the risk of diffusion of the epidemic, and that the decision to postpone the scheduled appointment is shared by both the professional and the patient (if clinical conditions allow that). (7) Electronic medical records should report: name of the patient, professional who made the phone check-in, date of the next scheduled appointment, clinical notes. The head of the team should oversee that the above-mentioned procedures are carried out as instructed. (8) A list of daily accesses to the service for appointment that cannot be deferred and pharmacological therapy administration/pick up should be compiled, making sure to avoid crowding in the waiting area.",

(4) In the triage area, health care professionals at the front desk will check the information reported on the self-administered form and collect the following data: name and reason for visiting (e.g. scheduled appointment, acute-direct access, emergency). (5) Each center is asked to ensure a clear path to access the building, and will guide users from the triage zone to the waiting area. (6) In the waiting area, social distancing must be guaranteed (therefore, the number of people allowed should be carefully monitored, chairs can be moved/removed from the area). (7) Outside the triage area, signs will report the new procedure for access, and will remind users about the necessity to maintain interpersonal distancing while in line. (8) Accompanying people are discouraged to access the building. Exceptions are made for caregivers of subjects with severe physical disabilities. However, their presence in the waiting area should be taken into account in order to maintain the minimum interpersonal distance. (9) Before the in-person visit, users are encouraged to use hand sanitisers. During the visit, the minimal interpersonal distance is mandatory (3 ft), mental health professionals will wear fluid-resistant surgical masks, and the room will be ventilated whenever safe and appropriate. If the user shows signs of fever (T > 99.5 F) and/or shortness of breath, the mental health professional will provide a fluid-resistant surgical mask to the user while he/she will wear a long sleeve disposable apron and gloves. (10) Before performing a visit at home or at any other external facility, mental health professionals should take all the steps to minimise the risk of transmission through safe working procedures. Information on health conditions should be collected from the patient and family members. ",
