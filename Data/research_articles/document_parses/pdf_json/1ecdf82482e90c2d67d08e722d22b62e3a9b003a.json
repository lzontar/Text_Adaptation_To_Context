Of interest another key immune cell, the Innale Lymphoid Cells type 2 (ILC2) , which are so important to keep lung integrity, do not migrate efficiently from the bone marrow to the lungs with aging. Transfer of young ILC2 to the old lung enhances mice resistance to infection. In addition TNF\uf061\uf02c IL6 levels and neutrophils increase with age. and may contribute to increased inflammation in the lungs. Furthermore it is well known that IL6 inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity. Therefore IL6 appears certainly a key molecule.",

CD8 T cells also decline and weaken with aging, a feature of immunesenescence (5). We do not know yet which is the relevance of vaccinations performed in early childhood as a tool to stimulate the system. This is an area of intense clinical research.. It has been suggested that SARS.CoV2 may enter into Alveolar Type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells, through ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) present on the membrane of AT2 and employs the serine protease TMPRSS2 for priming (6) . Once AT2 are infected they provide an innate immune response and synthesize Interferon type 1 (IFN\uf061\uf02f\uf062), type 2 (IFN\uf02d\uf067), IL6 and IL8 (7). The majority of the patients with this response, clear the infection. Once the SARS.CoV2 ssRNA, is released inside the AT2 cells, it is recognized by the Toll like receptors 7-8 (TLR 7-8). TLR 7 ligation induces signal transduction via the adaptor protein MyD88 and the activation leads to synthesize and release cytokines and chemokines.This may explain the inflammation and lung symptoms (Fig. 1) .",

H Henderson et al (1) on the therapeutic approach with Glucocorticoids (GC) to the inflammation and Cytokine Storm phases of SARS.CoV 2 infection. We would like to expand their analysis and discuss the data , so far reported in Children and Autoimmune patients ( Rheumatoid Arthritis , Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), about the chance of undergoing a \"severe\" infection. So far children (and autoimmune patients) , who should be extremely fragile, rarely entered into the third phase \"the cytokine release syndrome-CRS \" of COVID-19, leading only some patients to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Rheumatic patients did not emerge as principal targets of the severe infection in all the cohorts until now reported from China, Europe and US in the major Journals.. The latest report from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance shows that out of 334 registered infected patients (121 RA, 33 PsA, 58 SLE, 28 Axial SpA, 27 Vasculitis, 19 primary Sjogren's, et al.-of whom 74.25 females and 25.75 males) only 38 were hospitalized and 19 (5.69%) died. Out of 171 infected kids in China, only 12 had radiologic pneumonitis and only 1 died in pediatric ICU (2). This percentage does not appear higher than in the general population considering that > 65 % of adults rheumatic subjects were on DMARDs ( disease modyfying anti rheumatic drugs), 5.39 % were in Jak inhibitors, 36.5% were in Biologic DMARDs and 30.2 % on GC. Only 25.7% were on",

The key point is whether to use or not, and when, GC since the ATS and IDSA (10) did not strongly support the use of GC once the inflammatory phase progresses to the CRS and ARDS-like phase. Data from drug trials and real world are badly needed to give support to the theories.
