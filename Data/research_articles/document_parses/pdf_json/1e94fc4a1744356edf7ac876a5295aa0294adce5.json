            "text": "In this paper, the impact of human migration on the dynamics of dengue epidemic has been discussed. The vector-host model considers two patches with different dengue serotype in each patch. The model considers the constant rate of migration in susceptible and recovered class from one patch to other. Recovered migrants from prior infection are exposed to secondary infection in the patch where different serotype is present. The basic reproduction number is computed and analyzed in terms of migration parameters. The model is analyzed for the existence and local stability of various equilibrium states in terms of migration parameters. The numerical simulations for the choice of relevant data from literature have been performed to verify analytical results and to further explore the dynamics of the system. The sensitivity analysis of basic reproduction number with respect to migration parameters is carried out. It is found that immigration in a patch increases the basic reproduction in respective patch and vice-versa. The basic reproduction number has been estimated for the two states of Brazil which verifies the occurrence of severe epidemic in one of the states of Brazil.",

However, it has now been spread to more than 100 countries in the tropical, subtropical and temperate areas of North America, South America, Africa and Southeast Asia. According to one estimate, it affects 50-100 million people every year [1]. In fact, World Health Organization has declared dengue as the fastest communicable mosquito-borne disease in the world in terms of human morbidity and mortality [2, 3] . The causes of emergence and resurgence of dengue disease are attributable to multiple factors including urbanization, fast transportation, economic development and changes in human behavior. The fast increase in modes of transportation, their reach, speed and efficiency led to the global movement of human population [2, 4] . This may be responsible for the spread of infectious diseases from isolated locations to the new regions. It has been reported that another 100 million people travel to dengue affected areas where they not only increase the risk of contracting the disease but also spreading it further afield.",

The origin of all four dengue serotypes is found to have in Asian forests and subsequently they have spread worldwide because of the migration of human and commerce [5] . The mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the main carriers of these viruses. It is transmitted through infected mosquito bites. Once a person becomes infected by a serotype, he/she will never be reinfected by that serotype due to induced lifelong immunity against it. However, only temporal cross immunity is developed against the other serotypes [6] . Therefore, the recovered individuals from a serotype may get secondary infection when exposed to a different serotype. Primary infections are generally asymptomatic and nonfatal, while secondary infections sometimes lead to the fatal forms of dengue infection, namely, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1, 7] . Mathematical modeling has been applied to understand and control the many vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, leishmaniasis, chagas diseases etc [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Some mathematical models on dengue dynamics incorporating primary and secondary infection have been proposed and analyzed by various investigators [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Some studies on dengue have also confirmed that human migration is the main cause of its spatial spread [18, 19] . In particular, human movement was identified as an important factor for the spread of dengue serotype-1 from the southern region of Vietnam to its northern and central regions [20] . Also, human migration from one patch (area) to another increases the chances of secondary infection [6, 21] . During 1977 During -1978 , the dengue epidemic in Cuba occurred due to DEN-1 serotype with not a single case of DHF [22] . However, human migration from endemic countries (with DEN-2 serotype) to municipalities in Cuba has been reported to be responsible for DHF/DSS cases of subsequent epidemics in 1981 and 1997 [22, 23] . These facts exemplify the two largest outbreaks of secondary infection cases by DEN-2 in Cuba in 1981 and 1997 [22] [23] [24] . Further, human migration may be one of the reasons for the spread of secondary infection.",

The model considers human migration between two discrete patches having different dengue serotypes. Due to imperfect cross immunity towards heterologous serotype, the recovered migrants of patch-1 may get sec-ondary infection in patch-2. The impact of human migration on persistence or extinction of disease in patches has been discussed by considering all possible combinations of migration parameters. Stability analysis and numerical simulations have been carried out for various equilibrium states. Further, sensitivity indices of basic reproduction numbers for migration parameters have been computed. In the case study, the estimation of basic reproduction has also been performed for the two states of Brazil. The conclusion is given in the last section.",

Human (host) population is compartmentalized into S i , I i and R i for susceptible, infected and recovered individuals respectively in the ith patch, i = 1, 2. It is assumed that the infected individuals are unable to migrate due to disease-induced weakness. The susceptible individuals of patch-1 (patch-2) may become primary infected with serotype-2 (serotype-1) when they migrate to patch-2 (patch-1). The recovered migrants from patch-1 to patch-2 may become secondary infected when exposed to serotype-2 and form a new compartment of secondary infection I 12 in patch-2. As, the serotype DEN-2 is more associated with secondary infection [7, 23, 24, 34, 35] , the almost perfect cross immunity has been assumed for the recovered migrants from patch-2 to patch-1. The probability of getting secondary infection from serotype-1 is assumed to be negligibly small in patch-1. Accordingly, the recovered migrants from patch-2 to patch-1 will not get secondary infection. The secondary infected population I 21 is not being considered (I 21 \u223c 0) in patch-1. Further, this simplifying assumption reduces the dimension of the model.",

During summer 2002 a large outbreak of dengue due to DEN-3 serotype occurred in Rio de Janeiro [44] . In 2003, the human migration rate in Ceara was quite high as compared to Rio de Janeiro [45] . The sequential infection by DEN-2 serotype led to severe secondary infection cases in the form of DHF in the state Ceara [46, 47] . Keeping these facts in mind, let us consider the state Rio de Janeiro as patch-1 with DEN-3 serotype prevalent at time t and the state Ceara as patch-2 where DEN-2 serotype is present. The estimation of R 0 has been performed for the two patches from the initial growth phase of the epidemics [48] . Let us consider that at the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases, K (t), varies exponentially as K (t) \u221d K 1 exp(\u03bbt) (33) where, \u03bb is the force of infection and K 1 is constant.

By using the monthly temperature records of the states Ceara [52] and Rio de Janeiro [53] and substituting in Eq. (42) , the range of mortality rate for the two respective states has been calculated. The mortality rate of Aedes aegypti mosquito is found to be in the range of 0.02987767-0.0363767 for the state Rio de Janeiro. However, for the state Ceara, it is coming in the range of 0.02714614-0.03403341. Using the average value of the mortality rates, the estimated value of basic reproduction number of the respective states are given in Table 4 .",

It is assumed that the two distinct serotypes are predominant in respective patches. The main emphasis is given on inter-patch migration of human pop-ulation and its impact on spatial spread of primary as well as secondary infection. The existence conditions for equilibrium states are obtained in terms of R 0 . The disease-free state is found to be globally stable provided the basic reproduction numbers (R 10 , R 01 ) of both the patches are less than one. It is found from analysis that for the equilibrium state E 1 (E 2 ), where disease persists in patch-1 (patch-2), it will persist there irrespective of migration if the basic reproduction number of patch-2 (patch-1) is less than 1. Numerical implementations have been carried out for the relevant data from the literature to explore the stability of endemic state. For the set of data where E * exists, it is found that starting from the initial conditions in the neighborhood of the states E 1 and E 2 , the solution trajectories converge to the state E * . This shows the stability of the state E * .",

When equal rates of migration are considered in both the patches, the status of disease will not be affected due to migration. In other words, the disease-free state will not become endemic or vice-versa in any patch due to migration. However, the level of primary/secondary infection changes without affecting the disease-free/endemic status. On the other hand, when rate of migration is different in the patches, the persistence/extinction of infection will depend on the magnitude of the basic reproduction number of patches as well as the migration parameters.",
