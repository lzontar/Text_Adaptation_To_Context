Ebola had a low risk of spread once infection control measures were stringently applied. This was well understood in both villages. In Tawoveihun the chiefs led a community-based quarantine initiative and no cases occurred. In Taninihun there was a devastating outbreak caused by a funeral for a respected Islamic teacher as a result of which many of his pupils died. Enforced quarantine was a very painful experience, but people later realised this action had ended the outbreak. It seems clear from comments given to explain preferences that prospects for infection control had considerable weight. Choices were related to preventive measures or local byelaws in 42 per cent of comments (Table 5 and S1 Data). One player from Tawoveihun made the link between community action and avoidance of infection explicit by commenting that with Covid-19 \"we will survive through rules and regulations like we did during the Ebola crisis\" (Female, Tawoveihun, our emphasis). Perhaps disease preferences also reflected lack of confidence in the possibility of cure. Neither local nor hospital treatments were effective for EVD. At the outset, only 30 per cent or so patients recovered, and even in the later stages, survival was hardly better than 60 per cent. Whether someone sick with the disease lived or died was more a matter for God. For this reason, it may have seemed better to pick the option with the lower risk of infection in the first place and stick to the rules.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 745, "end": 753, "text": "(Table 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Nevertheless, a considerable minority (27 per cent) preferred disease \"orange\" (with a Covid-19-like profile).

No one can be sure whether or not the swearer is a brazen liar. But sickness, it is suggested, is not something that can be evaded by bluster; risks of infection are real. Overall, our evidence suggests that rural people in Sierra Leone respond to infection risks in rational and calibrated ways. The benefits of this response were experienced in the Ebola epidemic of 2014-15 [8] . We see no evidence that the same will not also be the case with Covid-19.
