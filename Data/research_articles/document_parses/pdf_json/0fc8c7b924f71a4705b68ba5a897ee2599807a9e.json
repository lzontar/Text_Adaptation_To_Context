In this regard, it is desirable to study the coughing-and sneezing-generated pathogen aerosols, its dispersion and transportation in isolation rooms, clinics, confined spaces and other general public places to evolve efficient ventilation system along with suitable protective measures to limit the spread of the virus. The present paper describes the overall experimental scheme supported with computational fluid dynamics evaluation to address this problem for evolution of optimal ventilation system using the National Aerosol Facility at IIT Kanpur set up in collaboration with BARC Trombay. The outcome of this study is aimed to evolve a national standard for optimum isolation rooms that would provide adequate protection to health workers.",

Moreover, in the present-day scenario of pandemic COVID-19 and for other future applications it is desirable to limit the exposure of health workers. The optimal design evolution of isolation rooms, quarantine facilities and clinics is desirable as different ventilation schemes are functions of pathogen size, initial velocity at the source, air quality described by its humidity and temperature. Controlling pathogen transport in confined spaces due to coughing, sneezing or talking requires efficient ventilation management for isolation wards, clinics and clean rooms with specified air changes, to protect the health professionals for their sustenance on a long-term basis with protective measures. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) generic guidelines require maintenance of negative pressure rooms with minimum of 12 air changes per hour or at least 160 l/s per patient in facilities with natural ventilation. However, the existing isolation rooms, clinics and quarantine facilities with multiple patients and medical workers need to be provided with an optimum ventilation system.",

            "text": "It was observed that within the indoor environments, there is a strong association between transmission of different pathogens, such as measles, tuberculosis, smallpox, and SARS, and the air movement, which is largely influenced by ventilation types as presented by Li et al. (2007) . Ventilation is the process of supplying fresh air to an enclosed space to refresh/remove the existing atmosphere. Efforts have been IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, India made in the past to understand the effect of ventilation types, human-to-human orientation, sneezing velocities, and droplet sizes on the transmission of exhaled micro droplets in different environments such as office rooms, hospital wards, or air cabins. However, most of these studies were limited to numerical analysis. A numerical study was carried out with two people sitting opposite to each other in a room by Gao and Niu (2006) . It was found that cross infection may occur because of the long distances travelled by the sneezed air in a specific direction. Another group studied the transmission of pathogens under different ventilation schemes, such as well mixed ventilation (WMV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under floor air distribution system (UFAD), in an office room as reported by Li et al. (2011) . Seepana and Lai (2012) conducted experiments and numerical simulation in a controlled chamber with two mannequins (source and susceptible) situated opposite each other at a fixed distance. The results at measured points indicated that droplet concentrations around the susceptible mannequin were higher when the mannequins were placed near the wall, rather than at the center. In a study conducted in a mock airborne infection isolation room, reported by Thatiparti et al. (2017) , an optimum ventilation configuration involved a linear supply diffuser. The optimum ventilation was achieved by interchanging the square supply and exhaust locations to place the exhaust closer to the patient source and allow clean air from supply vents to flow in clean-to-dirty flow paths. A recent study applicable to a restaurant in Guangzhou by Lu et al. (2020) suggested an improved ventilation for reducing droplet transmission. Thus, ventilation and air flow in a room or any controlled space plays a very important role in the spread of viruses like COVID-19. This knowledge will help to design optimal ventilation systems for hospitals and quarantine zones very efficiently to reduce spread in highrisk areas. The existing experimental and modelling setup at the National Aerosol Facility, IIT Kanpur, with minor modifications, can be used to understand the efficacy of isolation rooms considering virus as being produced from a group of sources (taking more number of patients) and studying its concentration distribution inside the room for an optimized ventilation strategy.",

We have developed a detailed numerical model where we have coupled aerosol microphysics with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for high-temperature aerosol source.

The formulation uniquely couples standard k-epsilon scheme (including mass, momentum, energy and boundary layer equations) with aerosol dynamics equations (nucleation, condensation, coagulation and deposition) through residence time. The model can be used to simulate spatial and temporal characteristics of evolving aerosol spectrum using experimentally measured input parameters and wire composition data. The coupling of CFD and aerosol dynamics offers better insights in comparison to standalone aerosol microphysics models or standalone CFD models.
