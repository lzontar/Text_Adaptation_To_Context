Traditionally, patients were kept on bedrest after subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and neurotrama, due to neurologic limitations such as fluctuation in mental status, requirement for sedation and paresis. Additional challenges associated with mobility in this population include the potential for positional changes to impact intracranial pressure Physician comfort level and concern for adverse neurological outcomes such as vasospasm or increased bleeding also decrease mobilization. While it is imperative to be cautious with NICU patients, prolonged bedrest and restricted mobility come with its own set of complications including muscle atrophy, decreased activity tolerance, delirium, pressure sores, nosocomial infections and deep vein thromboses.

She was refractory to benzodiazepines, so she was intubated and started on a propofol infusion. At 50mcg/kg/min of propofol, she was still having generalized clonic tonic seizures. She was transferred to our neurological ICU for continuous EEG monitoring. Propofol infusion was increased to 180mcg/kg/min (10 mg/kg/hr) to control her seizures. She remained seizure free for 24 hours. Propofol was weaned over 12 hours because she became hypotensive and required norepinephrine. When the propofol was turned off, CPK was 800, lactate was 1.3, and creatinine was 0.4. She received propofol for 36 hours. Twelve hours after propofol was stopped, she developed a metabolic acidosis, lactate increased to 3.6, creatinine increased to 1.5, urine output decreased, and CPK increased to >20,000. She then developed bradycardia with wide complex QRS, which progressed to asystole. She could not be resuscitated and died.",

Prior characterization of the mutant Wlds protein showed that it is a fusion gene product between the non-functional, truncated N70 amino acids of UBE4B and full functional sequence of nuclear NMNAT1, a rate-limiting enzyme in NAD+ synthesis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the mutant Wlds protein protects axons from stroke injuries remain unclear. We sought to understand how Wlds is able to robustly protect axons from ischemic injuries, and in doing so possibly identify novel therapeutic targets to attenuate axonal loss in stroke.",

We further observed that exogenous addition of NAD+, but not its precursors or immediate metabolites, was sufficient to confer axonal protection, while attenuating NAD+ levels abolished WldS axon protection.

Texas Children's Hospital recently opened a new pediatric ICU tower and subdivided the PICU into six specialty units: surgical, neurology/neurosurgery, pulmonary, hematology/oncology, medical and transitional (for patients with complex needs).

Neurologic complications occurred most frequently in the setting of mitral valve disease (15 infarcts, 5 SAH, 5 ICH) and in those with Staphylococcus (11) and polymicrobial infection (7).
