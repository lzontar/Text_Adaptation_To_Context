Although overall case fatality rates are remarkably similar in both China and Italy, 8 published rates vary dramatically when stratified by age, and early fatality rates in the elderly or those with coexisting diseases may range as high as 15%. 9 More recent observations suggest that with widespread testing and more accurate data on incidence, these numbers are decreasing.",

In addition to published descriptions such as those above, informal descriptions of critical care for COVID-19 patients in China and Italy have circulated among intensivists worldwide. From these informal descriptions, several aspects of severe respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients are atypical. Most patients who require noninvasive ventilation will progress rapidly to intubation, and early intubation is considered safer for providers and equivalent for patients. Unlike classical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung compliance is not severely reduced, and lung-protective ventilation is well tolerated. Hypoxemia is severe and advanced therapies such as pulmonary vasodilators and prone positioning have met with some success. Once instituted, mechanical ventilation may continue for 10-14 days.",

Rather, they represent clinical impressions and empiric observations from intensivists on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic and are likely to change as experience grows. Although the relationship between age, comorbidities, and COVID-19-associated respiratory failure described in early reports has been replicated in our clinical observations, 4 other observations represent new manifestations of the disease. Among these are clinically severe infections in younger patients and a wide diversity of presenting symptoms, including altered mental status, hepatic, myocardial, and kidney injury, and prolonged periods of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These observations suggest that critical care of severe COVID-19 is likely to evolve rapidly, and the tactical management of critical care resources will need to keep pace. The most dynamic focus is likely to be the search for more consistently effective treatments. A therapeutic ability to alter the clinical course of severe COVID-19 infection has the potential to improve critical care management dramatically. E",
