The hallmark microscopic lesions of MHD are transmural haemorrhages in the heart muscle and severe necrosis of heart muscle fibres (Sharp et al., 1972b) . This disease and its associated lesions are known Summary Mulberry heart disease (MHD) in pigs is characterized by lesions of acute haemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. The objectives of this study were to determine the levels of vitamin E and selenium and 13 other trace minerals in heart and liver tissues and to determine the prevalence of certain viral infections in heart tissues from MHD-affected and MHD-unaffected pigs and the vitamin E and selenium concentration in feed samples from selected farms with MHD. Based on the pathological examination, 114 pigs were separated into MHD lesion-negative (L-NEG) (n = 57) and MHD lesion-positive (L-POS) (n = 57) groups. Seventy-three samples (40 L-NEG and 33 L-POS) were subjected to chemical analysis, and 66 (32 L-NEG and 34 L-POS) were subjected to PCR detection for viral pathogens. Lower (P < 0.05) levels of myocardial copper, lower (P < 0.05) levels of hepatic magnesium and higher (P < 0.05) levels of myocardial and hepatic sodium were detected in the L-POS cases. Although lower (P < 0.05) levels of hepatic selenium were detected in L-POS group, all were within the normal range. Analysis of feed samples (n = 22) revealed that selenium levels in all the samples were above the legal limit (0.3 ppm) for pigs. Vitamin E levels in all feed samples were above 20 IU/kg. Among the 66 pigs subjected to PCR detection, there were 19, 4, 13, 8, 2 and 1 animals positive for porcine circovirus type 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, pan-herpes virus, porcine enterovirus, pan-pestivirus and porcine parvovirus, respectively.

Similarly, in Denmark, MHD persisted among young pigs even though abundant supplies of selenium and vitamin E were added to feedstuffs for sows and pigs (Nielsen et al., 1989) . In the present study, analysis of feed samples revealed that the selenium concentration for all samples was above the 0.3 ppm legal supplementation limit, and all vitamin E levels were above 20 IU/Kg. Based on these results, it is not likely that a deficiency of selenium and vitamin E is the cause of MHD in the present study. MHD may be a vitamin E-and seleniumresponsive condition in pigs but evidence continues to build indicating MHD is not because of a deficiency of either vitamin E or selenium in the diet. The level of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) in tissue is an important parameter to measure to further investigate the role of vitamin E in the occurrence of MHD. In spite of apparently adequate amounts of dietary alpha-tocopherol, previous results indicate that pigs with MHD (microangiopathy) had lower tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations than the control pigs (Rice and Kennedy, 1989) . Investigation of MHD cases revealed that mean liver vitamin E concentrations were lower in pigs with MHD than in pigs that died of causes other than MHD (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002) . In cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Iowa State University from 1999 to 2009, only 24.6% (30/122) of the MHD cases were actually deficient in liver concentrations of vitamin E, and similarly only 5.6% (6/106) cases were deficient in liver concentrations of selenium. The concentrations of selenium and vitamin E in the liver and heart tissues of young pigs that died suddenly and had characteristic lesions of MHD were not significantly different from the concentrations found in pigs of the same age that had died from other causes (Nielsen et al., 1989) . In the present study, in heart tissues, more pigs in the L-NEG group had deficient levels of vitamin E compared to L-POS pigs (8/33 L-POS; 23/40 L-NEG). This pattern was similar for liver tissues where a total of 40 pigs were deficient in vitamin E (11 L-POS; 29 L-NEG). This study does indicate a close association of heart and liver concentrations of vitamin E. As the concentration of vitamin E in the liver changed, the heart concentration also changed. With this information, it is difficult to associate MHD with a vitamin E deficiency as this study clearly provides evidence that pigs affected by MHD (L-POS) had high levels of vitamin E in tissues similar to levels in pigs with no lesions of MHD (L-NEG).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 252, "text": "(Sharp et al., 1972a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 253, "end": 272, "text": "Mahan et al., 1973;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 273, "end": 289, "text": "Van Vleet, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 538, "end": 562, "text": "(Rice and Kennedy, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 718, "end": 740, "text": "(Nielsen et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1621, "end": 1645, "text": "(Rice and Kennedy, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1801, "end": 1824, "text": "(Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2407, "text": "(Nielsen et al., 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Several studies investigated the selenium concentration of tissues originating from MHD-affected pigs. In one experimental study, tissue selenium concentration did not appear to be related to the incidence of MHDrelated lesions (Sharp et al., 1972b) . In Western Australia, hepatic selenium concentrations were not low in pigs with MHD (Moir and Masters, 1979) . In field cases, heart and kidney selenium concentrations were similar in pigs of either group, i.e. spontaneous MHD (microangiopathy) and control pigs (Rice and Kennedy, 1989) , and liver selenium concentrations were adequate in all pigs including MHD cases and non-MHD cases (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002) . In pigs that died of MHD (microangiopathy), hepatic selenium concentration in pigs was lower than levels found in healthy pigs (Korpela, 1990a ). In the present study, there were no significant differences in selenium levels in heart tissue; however, there was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in selenium in liver tissues. Even though the significant difference exists, the level of selenium for MHD pigs is not considered deficient, in fact it is considered within the adequate range (0.1-2.9 ppm). Of all the livers tested, the selenium levels were considered adequate in 71/73 and within the toxic range (3.0-120 ppm) in 2/ 73. This is not surprising when looking at the 22 feed samples, where all were above the legal supplementation limit. Selenium does occur naturally in corn and soy diets, which are the most common in swine rations; however, the level of selenium that naturally occurs in these diets is not higher than 0.1 ppm. When taking this into consideration, 19/22 feed rations were still above the legal supplementation limit as defined by the food and drug administration (FDA). It is most likely the excess selenium observed in these rations was because of added selenium, not naturally occurring selenium in the diet.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 249, "text": "(Sharp et al., 1972b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 336, "end": 360, "text": "(Moir and Masters, 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 514, "end": 538, "text": "(Rice and Kennedy, 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 639, "end": 662, "text": "(Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 792, "end": 807, "text": "(Korpela, 1990a", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Some mineral changes, including iron, (Korpela, 1990b) , calcium (Korpela, 1991) and magnesium (Korpela, 1991) , have been reported to be related to MHD.
