Historically, lowdose radiation was successfully used for treatment of infectious diseases such as pneumonia 3 . The concept of using low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia was first introduced by a group of Iranian and American scientists in March 2020 4 . Subsequently, Canadian, Spanish, American, German and more recently French scientists also confirmed the potential efficacy of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia. These reports have mainly focused on the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of LDRT and suggested that lung doses ranging 100 mGy-1000 mGy could be beneficial for treatment of severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.",

The current knowledge about the LDRT effect on the cytokine storm is extremely limited and there is no report about controlling systemic inflammations by LDRT. On the other hand, one of the most important concerns about utilizing anti-inflammatory approaches in infectious diseases is the suppression of immune responses against the invading pathogen which areAccepted ArticleThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved necessary for fighting and eliminating the pathogen. Tile now, numerous numbers of antiinflammatory drugs and approaches have been investigated for cytokine storm management in infectious diseases. However, none has been proved to be effective, and some have even worsened outcome13 .Some studies have reported a significant increase in uptake, activation, transcription, and spread of some viruses after irradiation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, apoptosis induction by ionizing radiations beams to the virus-infected cells as the reservoirs of millions of virus particles, might accelerate the spreading of the virus and consequently disease progression[14][15][16][17] . Therefore, due to the lack of knowledge about radiation beams' effects on SARS-CoV-2 and its infected cells, it's even possible that radiotherapy worsens the progression of the COVID-19 disease.Taking together, it seems necessary to comprehensively assess the different aspects of utilizing LDRT for COVID-19 treatment including LDRT effect on SARS-CoV-2 virus and the infected cells, the ability of LDRT to control cytokine storm of COVID-19 and its effect on the immune system fighting against SARS-CoV-2. Paying attention to these fundamental points may significantly enhance the efficacy and outcomes of further clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with LDRT.Rebuttal: SMJ Mortazavi, Ph.D.My PCP colleague has raised concerns about the efficiency of LDRT for treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. He, particularly believes that the early studies were mostly case reports, without randomization and blinding. The accidental discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming (1928) that changed the course of medicine started with a mold that developed on a staphylococcus culture plate. Previous studies clearly show LDRT can potentially afford therapeutic benefit against respiratory complications of COVID-19. Given this consideration, researchers have suggested clinical trials of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia \"we consider low-dose irradiation to be worth investigating in the clinical setting\"5 . It is worth noting that my research team is getting ready to start a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled trial that fully investigates the effects of LDRT on COVID-19 associated pneumonia.",
