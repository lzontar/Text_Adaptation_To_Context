Recently, new tests exploring the presence of subgroups of antibodies directed to \u03b22glycoprotein I (anti Domain 1 and Domain 4/5 antibodies), could be useful as an additional test in presence of incomplete APL antibody profiles for better antithrombotic treatment [9]. Moreover, antibodies to phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) have been evaluated with favorable results in APS diagnosis [4;9]. In conclusion, COVID-19 pneumonia appears to induce an inflammatory and hypercoagulable state with elevated interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels that could explain the high incidence of VTE. Abnormalities in coagulation screening measures, including a possible prolonged aPTT, in absence of bleeding signs and in presence of VTE, should suggest to clinicians the possible presence of aPL antibodies; it could prevent the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f anticoagulant suspension in high risk COVID-19 patients. Further studies are necessary to establish the exact mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of thrombosis that still appears unclear. Disclosure None to declare. 8.

In this prospective observational study, the authors evaluated the presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies (anticardiolipin and anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein I) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and venous thromboembolism (VTE). They chose not to assess lupus anticoagulant (LAC) due to false positivity in patients treated with heparin. This study found that the prevalence of aPL antibodies among COVID-19 patients with VTE was low, suggesting that aPL antibodies might not be involved in the pathogenesis of VTE in COVID-19 patients. These conclusions allow us to make some observations.",

[3] found an elevated positivity of LAC assays (91%) in patients with severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated with a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT). A different clinical significance can be attributed to positivity in individual tests. For example, isolated positive tests for the diagnosis of LAC do not appear to be associated with a significant increase in thromboembolic risk and, equally, the isolated positivity for anticardiolipin or anti-\u00df2 glycoprotein I antibodies. It is widely proven that positivity in more J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f than one test is associated with a higher thromboembolic risk, while triple positivity is associated with the highest risk of thromboembolic complications [5] .",

A LAC result should always be considered in the context of a full laboratory aPL profile. Moreover, positive laboratory tests should be confirmed 12 weeks after the initial testing[4].",
