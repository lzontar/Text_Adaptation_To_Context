Since then, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was reclassified as a pandemic, and health systems around the world have faced an unprecedented challenge. Objective: To summarize guidelines and recommendations on the urology standard of care during the COVID-19 pandemic. were retrieved using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL. This was supplemented by searching the web pages of international urology societies. Our inclusion criteria were guidelines, recommendations, or best practice statements by international urology organizations and reference centers about urological care in different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Of 366 titles identified, 15 guidelines met our criteria. Evidence synthesis: Of the 15 guidelines, 14 addressed emergency situations and 12 reported on assessment of elective uro-oncology procedures. There was consensus on postponing radical prostatectomy except for high-risk prostate cancer, and delaying treatment for low-grade bladder cancer, small renal masses up to T2, and stage I seminoma. According to nine guidelines that addressed endourology, obstructed or infected kidneys should be decompressed, whereas nonobstructing stones and stent removal should be rescheduled. Five guidelines/recommendations discussed laparoscopic and robotic surgery, while the remaining recommendations focused on outpatient procedures and consultations. All recommendations represented expert opinions, with three specifically endorsed by professional societies. Only the European Association of Urology guidelines provided evidence-based levels of evidence (mostly level 3 evidence). Conclusions: To make informed decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are multiple national and international guidelines and recommendations for urologists to prioritize the provision of care. Differences among the guidelines were minimal.

Goldman and Haber [4] stated that surgery can be delayed beyond 3 mo, and Ribal et al [5] and Kutikov et al [6] recommended treatment before the end of 3 mo. Indeed, considering the EAU guideline, depending on the local situation of the pandemic, surgery for highrisk PCa can be postponed until after the pandemic [5] . Prescribing neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy in this situation is an option [5] [6] [7] . In the case of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, several authors stated that radical cystectomy is nondeferrable and neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be omitted [5,6,8,] . Carneiro et al [7] suggested that neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be delayed for up to 6-8 wk and cystectomy can be delayed for up to 10 wk. The authors agreed that a delay of <3 mo is acceptable for T1b-T2 renal tumors. Another concern is metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The EAU panel discussed that cytoreductive surgery is controversial irrespective of the pandemic [5] . Only two articles covered recommendations regarding adrenal masses, and both agreed that adrenal masses >4 cm or functional should be treated in <1 mo [4, 8] . Orchiectomy for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f suspected testicular tumors is nondeferrable. While several authors suggested starting adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy for stage I seminomas, the EAU guidelines recommended active surveillance as the first choice of management for stage I seminoma [5] .
