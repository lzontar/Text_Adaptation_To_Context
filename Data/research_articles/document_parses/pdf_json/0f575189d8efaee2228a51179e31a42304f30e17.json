This novel virus was initially identified through next-generation sequencing (NGS) and suggested to have a possible zoonotic origin 2 . Till date, detailed morphology and ultrastructure of this virus remains incompletely understood.",

The throat swab from this case was kept in commercially available transport medium (HiViral\u2122 Transport Medium, HiMedia, Mumbai). A 500 \u03bcl aliquot from this specimen that had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was centrifuged to remove the debris. The supernatant was removed, fixed at a final concentration of one per cent glutaraldehyde and adsorbed onto a carbon-coated 200 mesh copper grid. Negative staining was done with sodium phosphotungstic acid as described earlier 3 . The grid was examined under 100 kV accelerating voltage in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) Tecnai 12 BioTwin\u2122 (FEI Company, The Netherlands). Imaging was done using a low-dose mode and images were captured using a side-mounted 2k \u00d7 2k CCD camera (Megaview III, Olympus, Japan).",

This particle was 75 nm in size and showed patchy stain pooling on the surface and a distinct envelope projection ending in round 'peplomeric' structures ( Figure A) . We used a mild defocussing of the projector lens away from the conventional Fresnel focus in an attempt to image the finer details of the envelope projections. All focusing operations were carried out using a Fourier fast focus transform under the TIA imaging software (FEI Company, The Netherlands). The defocussed image under low-beam current conditions prominently brought out the finer morphology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus surface projection as typical of a coronavirus ( Figure B ). We further increased the magnification under low-dose image capture and generated a pixel-corrected image of the projection to image single glycoprotein organization. The image revealed the presence of stalk-like projections ending in round peplomeric structures typical of a coronavirus particle ( Figure C) .",

A recent cryoEM study imaging the purified envelope spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has reconstructed three-dimensional images at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution 7 .

Although TEM imaging was limited by particle load in the specimen, we could still detect morphologically identifiable intact particles in stored clinical sample without initial fixation. Imaging other specimens such as stool and use of immunoelectron microscopy techniques can improve the detection frequency of virus in direct clinical material. This finding emphasizes the merit of the use of conventional negative-stained TEM imaging in clinical samples along with other diagnostic tests in parallel, especially in situations identifying aetiologic agents 9 .

Saha, P. Shinde, S. Salve, V. Vipat Figure. Transmission electron microscopy imaging of COVID-19. (A) A representative negative-stained COVID-19 particle showing morphodiagnostic features of family Coronaviridae. (B) Defocussed image of the same particle resolving the virus envelope glycoprotein morphology in finer details. The boxed area A shows a tetramer-like aggregate of four distinct peplomers, arrows shown by B show a more orthodox morphology of coronavirus surface projections. M indicates the matrix of the virus particle. C shows a distinct 'peplomer head' with negative stain silhouette. The area D is interesting as possible linear projections could be imaged. Five distinct peplomers could be imaged as shown by the arrows. (C) A highly magnified processed image for pixel corrections shows a distinct evidence of direct 'stalk' connecting the peplomer to the virion surface. The peplomers are shown with asterisk and the stalk with an arrow. Magnification bars are built into the micrographs.",
