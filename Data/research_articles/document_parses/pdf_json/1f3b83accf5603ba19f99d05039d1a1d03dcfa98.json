Thus, pure physics simulations and human systems simulations did not fulfil the inclusion criteria.

Moreover, SD was used in several studies to evaluate the long-term health impact of smoking by comparing policies such as increasing cigarette excise taxes, raising the legal smoking age to 21 [SD4] and introducing tobacco harm reduction policies [SD8, 9, 11] . They suggested that a large tax increase would have the largest and most immediate effect on smoking prevalence. Control over the cigarette content would bring a net gain in population health, although 'healthier' cigarettes make smoking more attractive and increase tobacco consumption. SD has also been used by health planners to gain a better understanding of diabetes population dynamics [SD7]; to model the feedback effects of reconfiguring health services [SD10] by shifting towards the primary level and bringing services 'closer to home'; to investigate the impact of privacy legislation in the individual health insurance market and the social costs that are borne when applicants do not divulge private information about their medical conditions [SD14].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 793, "end": 795, "text": "9,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 796, "end": 799, "text": "11]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discrete-Event Simulation"}, {"text": "Modelling healthcare systems and infrastructure disruptions A healthcare system consists of many individual sub-parts that interact with each other, for example the national health system (NHS) consists of vast numbers of GP clinics, walkin centres, hospitals, tertiary care centres, A&E, IT infrastructure, NHS supply chains, etc. SD allows modelling of several sub-parts of these complex healthcare systems, such as a city's delivery of emergency and on-demand, unscheduled care [SD12], an A&E dynamics of demand pattern, resource deployment and parallel hospital processes [SD15].

Six are reported in the MCS category, four in DES and one in SD. However, this is not to say that the case-oriented simulation studies that have not implemented their results have gone astray. Neither should it be implied that their impact is only academic and does not reflect the real world. Looking further at the issue, one may realise that healthcare simulation studies generally have a long gestation period before they reach the ultimate decision makers in a comprehensive format. These decision makers need to decide among a plethora of similar studies, taking into consideration various other factors, and come to a conclusion of turning a specific recommendation from a study into a policy applicable in health organisations and settings. Subsequently, it is unlikely that implementation will be part of the paper. Moreover, researchers are eager to publish once they have the first results in hand and only very occasionally will they wait until the impact of their method is shown in the real world in order to incorporate it into their paper. Perhaps a better measure of the interest in the research being conducted in the healthcare simulation studies is the funding process. Of the 201 studies, 87 (43%) have received full or partial funding.

One reason for this is possibly that the number of journals indexed by ISI WoS has swelled with the rising popularity of the Internet and the availability of electronic bibliographical information (this may not have been the case during 1970s-1980s). Furthermore, it is arguable that although simulation has been applied to manufacturing, defence, supply chains etc., for a long time, its application in the healthcare context is comparatively new.

The ascending lines show the increasing number of published papers in the field especially after the mid-1990s for all three simulation methods.

Cost-benefit analyses health studies with the use of MCS are also popular. They assess the economic value of population-based screen-and-treat alternative strategies for diseases and medical conditions. Some of these studies hold the first positions in terms of research impact and are found to have the maximum average number of citations in our dataset. Moreover, it is particularly noticeable that of the 142 MCS papers, none were published in an OR journal (as defined by the Association of Business School-ABS list). One reason for this may be that MCS is extensively used by health professionals/academics who wish to publish in health-related outlets, or that OR academics have lost interest in the use of MCS and have focused in the use of other simulation techniques to tackle health problems.

A very apparent example is that all simulation techniques deal with screening strategies and cost-benefit analysis of medical interventions. Assuming that the categorisation of papers was made according to the health problem tackled and regardless of the simulation technique employed, the papers of cost-benefit analysis would be at about the same level of the health risk assessment category. However, many researchers will agree that, although the application area is the same, the extent, the level and the detail at which this is examined differs according to the technique employed. SD takes a holistic approach and thus the health problem or situation is looked at from a more global level to a greater extent. Consequently, this technique is appropriate for facilitating health policy making at the macro-level. DES and ABS examine the health problems in more detail (micro-level), taking into account the properties of individual entities, yet this restricts the extent of the system that can be modelled. Therefore, decisions can usually be reached with the use of DES and ABS only at the operational level. Monte Carlo simulation incorporates the random sampling element at aggregated level, which makes modelling of population-based diseases easy to handle. When the individual aspect is important then DES is more appropriate. Moreover, DES and SD are more suitable for modelling problems in which the time element plays a significant role, such as utilisation of health services' resources and bed/equipment capacity management. Nonetheless, looking at the categories presented in this study, one can see that health risk assessment is pertinent to MCS modelling; planning of health services is most of the times handled with the DES models (and less with SD); and training of health students and managers is prevalent in the SD approach.

This gives the opportunity to a number of people, including some stakeholders of the systems under question to engage in modelling and quantify their problems and the impact of alternative actions.

They also relate to identifying areas of improvement of service through possible reorganisation of existing resources, for example; reorganisation of surgical and anaesthesia care surrounding laparoscopic surgery [DES21]; experimenting with real-time health information system to reduce response time [DES40]; evaluating operating policies in clinical environments [DES28] and allocation policies for liver transplantation [DES17]; forecasting the impact of changing demand for treatment of irreversible renal failure [DES33] and planning for the geographical locations of new healthcare services taking into account the demographics of the population and the location of the patients who need the services [DES18]. Furthermore, DES is well-suited to tackle problems in A&E departments, where resources are scarce and patients arrive at irregular times [DES2], and effectively combine Total Quality Management strategies [DES24] and data mining [DES8] for better results. Moreover, DES applications relate to estimating performance measures impacting facilities design and planning of veterinary practice [DES37].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF14": {"text": "[DES1]; for comparing methods of managing chronic osteoarthritis pain [DES3]; for modelling the treated course of schizophrenia so as to estimate the long-term costs and effects of new interventions [DES15]; for evaluating the cost effectiveness of screening strategies for diabetic retinopathy by varying the screening method and interval [DES27, 36] and of introducing a range of automated image analysis systems for cervical screening programmes [DES16]; and for estimating the cost-effectiveness and the direct healthcare costs pertaining to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [DES34]. The use of DES health economic models have also been reported for the economic evaluation of pacemakers. For example, DES was used for modelling the health benefits and economic implications of implanting dual-chamber versus single-chamber ventricular pacemakers in the UK [DES14] and of implanting a Cardiac Resynchronization device of Therapy for reducing heart failure as opposed to Optimum Pharmacologic Therapy that does not require a pacemaker [DES13]. DES was also used to improve the National Blood Service supply chain by investigating different blood ordering and distribution policies [DES7]. and methodology papers Our research methodology identified a number of review papers in the healthcare literature. Some of these papers compared modelling techniques used in healthcare, such as DES, Markov and semi-Markov chain models, queuing models and deterministic models (in the context of patient flow models [DES39] and economic evaluations of healthcare technologies [DES22]) and presented taxonomies of modelling structures [DES5, 10, 32]. Other papers present a personal reflection of DES [DES12] and outline a vision of the future use of simulation in healthcare [DES9]. They all found DES to be particularly suitable for estimating cost and health benefits of dynamic population-based models with individual attributes and patient care systems with scarce resources. In our search, five methodology papers were identified. They deal with various issues such as the use of patientchart-driven computer simulation to advance A&E system [DES20]; the use of DES as one emerging modelling technique for supporting decision making in randomized clinical trials of breast cancer [DES31], for modelling patient behaviour when screening for diabetic retinopathy [DES25] and for evaluating imaging technologies [DES4]. Moreover, DES has been acknowledged as a well-suited methodology for modelling health systems [DES38] and a valuable training tool for students who learnt to analyse and design efficiently work-flow processes in healthcare [DES30]. disease interventions DES applications in this category usually relate to proposing ways to suppress the spread of HIV in developing countries [DES19,23], and to the public response to control the outbreak of contagious diseases that may be caused by natural occurrence [DES11] or an act of terrorism [DES26].
