            "text": "In the rush to arrange instruction for language students who are temporarily homebound due to the coronavirus pandemic, it may be easier for teachers to focus on providing access to content rather than to worry about how well the content is designed and delivered. It is certainly understandable if language instruction, at least temporarily, relies more on teacher-based instructional resources such as drill-and-practice worksheets or multiplechoice responses; these are relatively simple to package and students may be able to complete them with less (or no) instructional support. However, there are alternative approaches which are both feasible and practical. It is still important to make sure that learners are able to take advantage of the learning opportunities offered to them, particularly now that language learning tasks may compete with other (perhaps more fun, more challenging, or more time-consuming) activities at home. Teachers can continue to help their learners make progress in their language learning by using a task engagement framework to support the design and delivery of tasks. A focus on task engagement is useful not only because task engagement can support student motivation and achievement (Henrie, Halverson, & Graham, 2015; Reeve & Lee, 2014) , but because the research literature notes that when students are engaged in a task they are less likely to be affected by variables external to the task (Christenson, Reschly, & Wylie, 2012; Fraser, 1986) . At a time when learners may be experiencing fear and chaos in other aspects of their lives, this learning focus is essential across both online and offline language learning contexts.",

For example, with an interesting and authentic topic to attract their attention (perhaps something about how the pandemic is affecting them and others or what they think about it) and a list of resources/tools that students can choose among (e.g., news at their level, relevant blogs, or social media streams), students can remain fully engaged in their online or offline tasks. Likewise, with engagement facilitators integrated into the task goal/product elements, learners may be more likely to be engaged in the process, even if it includes subtasks that they might otherwise find boring. Focusing on a few of the task elements, rather than the whole set, can assist teachers to create tasks that take less time to design but are still engaging to students. While schools are closed, language teachers can use some of the time free from managing their classrooms to reflect on simple ways to engage all students by choosing a few task elements on which to focus' examples are presented in the next section.",

            "text": "In addition, understanding the facilitators that support student task engagement, in general, can assist teachers in engaging students, specifically. For example, authenticity, which can be defined as learners' perceptions that the task is meaningful, valuable, and/or enjoyable, is a facilitator that is often mentioned in the literature (see, e.g., Guariento & Morley, 2001) . Some students will find a worksheet that asks them to conjugate verbs authentic, while, for others, the task might be more engaging if the same type of verb conjugations were integrated into a task about people in their community or with whom they might want to use the target language in the future. Because it is less likely during this crisis that teachers are fronting whole classrooms, this may be an opportunity to differentiate and engage students with tasks that focus on their individual interests and needs. For example, the curriculum may require that all learners are able to use past tense verbs well. The teacher can quickly search the Newsela (https://newsela. com) website for the English language standard that applies and the news stories that support that standard. She can then provide learners with a list of appropriate stories and help them choose those that are both interesting and at the appropriate level (out of the five that the app provides for each story). In this way, while still focusing on the curricular goal, learners can engage in reading and complete exercises that are interesting to them without the teacher having to create an individual lesson for each learner.",

Interaction can include sending letters/audio recordings through the mail, finding a pen pal in another country, or having a specific time to meet with peers and teacher online (or by audio through an app such as Discord (https://discord.com) or any Voice over Internet Protocol service such as Skype).

Scott Fitzgerald: The Real Gatsby?\" (http://questgarden.com/203/20/4/190702134551/) provides a lesson in which older students conduct research and decide the answer to the title question. Teachers can search by grade level or content area for one or more appropriate Quests (out of thousands available) and assign them with or without changes. Learners can then use feedback from each other and from the Quest resources to complete their tasks while the teacher works with students or groups who might need more help. Further, WebQuests may be more accessible to learners than other resources are because they use less bandwidth by often incorporating static, text-based resources.
