Numerous OAS1 and OAS2 mRNA iso forms are produced by alternative splicing. The OAS1 domain comprising the first 346 amino acid residues and encoded by five exons is repeated with a high degree of homology twice in OAS2 and thrice in OAS3.

The Chukchi, an Arctic Mongoloid population, live in the area not endemic for ticks and have not been exposed to the TBE virus at least for a very long time [25] . In the previous study, we found that the frequen cies of the OAS3 genotypes T/T (SNP rs2285932) and G/G (SNP rs2072136) and of the OAS2 allele A (SNP rs15895) were significantly higher in patients with severe TBE forms in comparison to patients with milder TBE and/or population controls [20] .

Next the PCR product was digested with 5 units XbaI restriction endonuclease (Sibenzyme) for 12 h at 37\u00b0C. samples with the genotype G/G produced one fragment of 369 bp, those with the genotype A/A produced two fragments (229 and 140 bp), and those with the geno type G/A produced three fragments (369, 229 and 140 bp).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Interpopulational Significant differences are shown in bold (P < 0.05).(6.0%) and in a small number of Caucasians and Kha kass.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Allele and genotype frequencies of the OAS3 SNP rs2285932 in seven North Eurasian populations", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Genotype frequency, % </td><td>Allele frequency, %\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Population </td><td>N\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03c7\n2 HW\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>C/C </td><td>C/T </td><td>T/T </td><td>C </td><td>T\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Russians </td><td>265 </td><td>57.0 </td><td>35.8 </td><td>7.2 </td><td>74.9 </td><td>25.1 </td><td>0.57\n</td></tr><tr><td>Germans </td><td>96 </td><td>35.4 </td><td>57.3 </td><td>7.3 </td><td>64.1 </td><td>35.9 </td><td>5.73*\n</td></tr><tr><td>Altaians </td><td>99 </td><td>72.7 </td><td>27.3 </td><td>0.0 </td><td>86.4 </td><td>13.6 </td><td>2.47\n</td></tr><tr><td>Khakass </td><td>85 </td><td>83.5 </td><td>14.1 </td><td>2.4 </td><td>90.6 </td><td>9.4 </td><td>2.52\n</td></tr><tr><td>Shorians </td><td>86 </td><td>89.5 </td><td>10.5 </td><td>0.0 </td><td>94.8 </td><td>5.2 </td><td>0.26\n</td></tr><tr><td>Tuvinians </td><td>110 </td><td>90.0 </td><td>10.0 </td><td>0.0 </td><td>95.0 </td><td>5.0 </td><td>0.30\n</td></tr><tr><td> Chukchi </td><td>112 </td><td>69.6 </td><td>28.6 </td><td>1.8 </td><td>83.9 </td><td>16.1 </td><td>0.39\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Allele and genotype frequencies of the OAS3 SNP rs2072136 in seven North Eurasian populations", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Genotype frequency, % </td><td>Allele frequency, %\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Population </td><td>N\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03c7\n2 HW\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>G/G </td><td>G/A </td><td>A/A </td><td>G </td><td>A\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Russians </td><td>260 </td><td>50.0 </td><td>41.2 </td><td>8.8 </td><td>70.6 </td><td>29.4 </td><td>0.02\n</td></tr><tr><td>Germans </td><td>89 </td><td>61.8 </td><td>36.0 </td><td>2.2 </td><td>79.8 </td><td>20.2 </td><td>1.16\n</td></tr><tr><td>Altaians </td><td>98 </td><td>29.6 </td><td>51.0 </td><td>19.4 </td><td>55.1 </td><td>44.9 </td><td>0.10\n</td></tr><tr><td>Khakass </td><td>77 </td><td>29.9 </td><td>53.2 </td><td>16.9 </td><td>56.5 </td><td>43.5 </td><td>0.53\n</td></tr><tr><td>Shorians </td><td>83 </td><td>26.5 </td><td>45.8 </td><td>27.7 </td><td>49.4 </td><td>50.6 </td><td>0.59\n</td></tr><tr><td>Tuvinians </td><td>107 </td><td>36.4 </td><td>43.0 </td><td>20.6 </td><td>57.9 </td><td>42.1 </td><td>1.49\n</td></tr><tr><td>Chukchi </td><td>107 </td><td>53.3 </td><td>41.1 </td><td>5.6 </td><td>73.8 </td><td>26.2 </td><td>0.44\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Pairwise linkage disequilibrium between rs2285932 and rs2072136 (OAS3) and rs15895 (OAS2) SNPs in seven North Eurasian populations assessed by the permutation test using the EM algorithm SNP pair", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Haplotype frequencies of the rs2285932 (C/T), rs2072136 (G/A) (OAS3), and rs15895 (G/A) (OAS2) SNPs in seven North Eurasian populations Note: Nucleotide order in the haplotypes structure corresponds to the SNP order on the chromosome (rs2285932, rs2072136, and rs15895).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "This work was supported in part by the Integration Project of Gene Pool Characteristic According to the Polymorphism in Genes of Susceptibility/Resistance to Infectious Diseases as part of the Biodiversity and Gene Pool Dynamics Basic Research Program of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences (project no.11.6).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"}]}
