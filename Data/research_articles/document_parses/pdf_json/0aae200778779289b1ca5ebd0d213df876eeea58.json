In this context, and to allow a rapid start of research projects, the French Ministry of Health decided to initiate a fasttrack process for approval of prospective research protocols in humans by the National Ethics Committee (NEC)(1). The present letter reports the worldwide registration of human research clinical studies on COVID-19, with a specific focus on French specificities.Worldwide studies recording:All clinical studies in the field of COVID-19 recorded on the national registries between May 15 th and 20 th (search terms: COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) were carefully identified (2). They were classified into study type i.e interventional (\"expanded access\" studies were considered as interventional) or observational, recruitment status (recruiting, not yet recruiting, or completed), and country (countries with < 10 studies were grouped in \"others\").French studies recording:In France, all prospective clinical studies must be approved by one of the 39 NECs before the first inclusion. These studies are divided into 3 different categories according to the risk/benefit ratio for the patient (Category 1: randomised controlled trials (RCT)), Category 2: interventional; Category 3: observational). During the COVID-19 outbreak, all NECs maintained their assessment of submitted studies (non-COVID-19 studies: one meeting per month). Some volunteer NECs were assessing the COVID-19 studies daily leading to decrease the time between submission and first assessment < 5 days (3).Results:On May 20 th , 2255 clinical studies about COVID-19 were registered in 18 national registries (1319 (58%)",
