The virus was isolated from biologic samples and identified as genus betacoronavirus, placing it alongside other Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 1 At the time of writing, the number of persons infected by the virus has now surpassed 67 091 and Chinese authorities have reported 1527 deaths from the virus, most in Hubei, the provincial epicenter of the outbreak. 2 Over 25 countries have confirmed cases to date, including countries from Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East (see Figure 1 ). 2 The virus spread internationally within 1 month of the first identification, and can be transmitted via close human-tohuman contact. 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as of 1 February 2020.",

The WHO did not receive an update from the Chinese government until the end of March, with 792 cases and 31 deaths reported. The lack of transparency of the Chinese health ministry has been cited as one of the largest contributors to the spread of the virus globally. 4 At the end of the epidemic, China reported >8,000 cases of the disease and 774 deaths, and a case-fatality rate of 7%. 5 The reservoir host of the disease was thought to be the Asian civet cat (Paguma larvata). The foci of transmission from host to human were thought to be the open markets, much like the COVID-19 outbreak currently ongoing. 5 The SARS global outbreak was contained in July 2003 and since 2004 there have not been any known cases of SARS reported. 6 After the emergence of SARS, MERS was the second coronavirus resulting in a major global public health crisis. It first emerged in 2012 in Saudi Arabia when a 60 yearold man presented with severe pneumonia. 7 An outbreak of the virus did not occur until 2 years later, in 2014, with a total number of identified cases of 662 and a 32.97% case-fatality rate. 8 From 2014 to 2016, 1364 cases were observed in Saudi Arabia. A total of 27 countries were affected by MERS during the outbreaks spanning Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America. Cases that were identified outside of the Middle East, including the outbreak in South Korea in which 186 individuals were infected as a result of a super spreader, were transplanted individuals that had previously been infected in the Middle East. 9 Since 2012, 2494 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS have been reported, and 858 associated deaths have occurred (34.4% case-fatality ratio). 8, 10 Key Messages \u2022 Inadequate risk assessment by the Chinese government hampered efforts to contain the virus.",

            "text": "With respect to COVID-19, diagnosis was conducted initially by assessing clinical characteristics of the presenting patient, chest imaging and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pneumonia. Once common bacterial and viral pathogens were ruled out, lower and upper respiratory tract specimens were obtained for cell culture and deep sequencing analysis. These specimens indicated a novel coronavirus initially known as '2019-nCoV'. 3 PCR, using the 'RespiFinderSmart22kit' (PathoFinder BV) realtime reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay, was used to detect viral RNA by targeting a consensus RNA dependent RNA polymerase region of pan b-CoV. 3 A diagnostic test was developed soon after viral isolation. Treatment in some hospitals involves prophylactic antibiotics to prevent secondary infection. 3 To date, no antiviral agent has been proven effective against COVID-19. Initial reports showed that oseltamivir was given to 93% of patients (orally administered 75 mg 2x/day) in combination with antibiotics. Patients experiencing severe illness (22%) were given corticosteroids (40-120 mg/day) to reduce lung inflammation due to high levels of cytokines caused by the virus, as part of a combined regimen for cases that were communityacquired and diagnosed at the designated hospital. 3 Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the local hospital, a randomized controlled trial was initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. 3 A suspected case according to the WHO is a patient 'with severe acute respiratory infection (fever, cough and requiring admission to hospital), and with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation and at least one of the following: a history of travel to or residence in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in the 14 days prior to symptom onset, or the patient is a health care worker who has been working in an environment where severe acute respiratory infections of unknown etiology are being cared for'. 11 A confirmed case is 'a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms'. 11 On February 13 2020 the Hubei National Health Commission said it would include cases confirmed by clinical diagnosis using CT scans in addition to rt-PCR, adding several thousand new cases to the total count. Diagnosis of MERS by the WHO is defined initially as patients presenting with a fever, cough and hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract involvement. 12 Patient history was obtained upon hospitalization and prominent considerations for diagnosis involved a history of contact with probable or confirmed cases of the illness, or a reported history of travel or residence within the Arabian Peninsula. Severe cases were subjected to laboratory testing. 13 Similar to COVID-19, RT-PCR was used for diagnosis. Additional serum tests for antibodies of the virus were developed. In Saudi Arabia, a clinical trial revealed that a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon beta-1b was shown to be effective among MERS cases. 14 Additionally, a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug named remdesivir presented potent efficacy for the treatment of MERS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus in preclinical studies. 15, 16 A patient was considered to have laboratory-confirmed SARS if there was a positive RT-PCR result from two or more clinical specimens, either from different sites or tested in different laboratories, obtained from patients before or after death, or if there was seroconversion by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay, indirect fluorescent antibody test or neutralization assay. 17 Similar to MERS, serologic testing for IgG antibodies was developed for SARS coronavirus. Treatment of SARS involved combination therapy of lopinavir and ritonavir and was associated with substantial clinical benefit with fewer adverse clinical outcomes. 18 A broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug named remdesivir presented potent efficacy for the treatment of MERS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus in preclinical studies. 15, 16 There are several similarities between these viruses in their diagnosis and treatment. All three viruses are definitively diagnosed by utilizing cell cultures of respiratory fluids, serum antibody analysis or RT-PCR analysis of respiratory fluids from patients. All three viruses cause pneumonia, and radiography of the lungs is an important diagnostic tool for preliminary and broad identification of the severity of the disease. These viruses are similarly treated with antiviral therapies, although no specific antiviral therapy has yet been approved for COVID-19, with clinical trials underway. The major difference between COVID-19 and its predecessors is that this virus rarely produces runny noses or gastrointestinal symptoms in those infected, which are commonplace in MERS and SARS cases. 3",

Furthermore, fomites, fecal transmission and handling of animals (killing, selling or preparing wild animals) were less common methods of transmission. 20 The modes of transmission, although still in part unclear regarding COVID-19, are thought to be the same mechanism for all three viruses. Infection via respiratory droplets or secretions of infected individuals are thought to be the predominant mode of transmission from human to human.

The suspected reservoir hosts are currently believed to be bats, similar to the SARS epidemic. The focal point of the epidemic is the Huanan seafood market. SARS was also hypothesized to have arisen from one of these types of markets. These commonalities may signal the need for closure of these wholesale markets in China. China has a long history of live-animal markets considered vital to communities across the country. As such, it is unlikely that these markets will be closed permanently, although their closure would be the strongest deterrent to another zoonotic disease outbreak. Re-opening of these markets should be under strict purview of the CCDCP, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure health and hygiene protocols that limit live-animal and human contact are used. Surveillance of these markets may be vital for controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases.

Among them are limited coordinated efforts among stakeholders with few policies in place for inter-sectoral collaboration, a lack of medical supplies (shortages of masks, goggles) and laboratory facilities for assessment of the disease. Additionally, many cases may have been asymptomatic; so it is difficult to predict when the epidemic will peak and introduces further difficulty in the detection of cases. A recent correspondence to the New England Journal of Medicine documented an asymptomatic contact in Germany. 25 In order to contain the virus, Chinese authorities prevented travel to, from and within the city of Wuhan on 23 January, as airline and railway departures were suspended. Between the 23 and 25 January, travel restrictions were implemented in 18 additional cities, affecting nearly 60 million people. The orders issued by Beijing were significant, but late in coming: the first official case of the virus was confirmed almost 2 months previously (8 December 2019) and the length of time it took for China's state-controlled media to reveal the nature of the illness was too great. This can be attributed to a failure of proper risk assessment and management by the Chinese government and health ministry. By the time travel was suspended, however, millions of Chinese citizens had passed through the affected region, unaware of the risks involved. SARS too, spread globally, due to many of the clinical features of the disease being unknown early in the course of the outbreak, and the significant variation in clinical infection control among South East Asian countries. Similar to the current situation in China, there were inadequate supplies of protective gear for the general population, which, had they been available, could have slowed the spread of the illness. SARS signs and symptoms presented rapidly, and health and hospital authorities were illprepared. This combined with insufficient communication of the Chinese government with the public led to panic. Additionally, the lack of infrastructure such as infectious disease hospitals in China added complexity to its control. The pandemic cost the global economy an estimated $30-$100 billion. 26 MERS on the other hand, did not spread globally rapidly, in part due to the lower risk of human-to-human transmission of the virus. Asymptomatic cases also provided an extra layer of complexity in the control of the disease. The biggest threat to the eradication of the disease is the variability and inadequacy of infection control in the region most heavily impacted by the virus (the Middle East). These inadequate infection control measures included a lack of physical barriers between patients, lack of negative pressure rooms and overall non-adherence to infection protocols such as proper hand hygiene and sanitation methods. 27 Parallels can be drawn between SARS and COVID-19 which can partially be attributed to their origins in China. Similar conditions led to the explosive spread of these viruses, including exposure to live animals at open markets, overcrowded conditions, lack of health infrastructure and lack of transparency between government officials and the general population. MERS and COVID-19 are also similar in that cases can remain asymptomatic while still spreading the disease. 25 These viruses all erupted with no specific vaccine or treatment recommended. This is hampering efforts by public health and medical practitioners to limit the spread of COVID-19.",

Scientists also believe that an animal source is 'the most likely primary source', and human-to-human transmission has occurred, with growing numbers of cases reportedly without exposure to animal markets. 3 Early in the outbreak, a top Chinese government-appointed expert stated a mysterious respiratory illness had killed at least four people with evidence of human-to-human transmission, heightening public concern. 36,37 It is likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, and similarities can be drawn more closely to SARS than MERS, because of the virus' rapid rate of infection. 38 When person-to-person spread occurred with SARS and MERS, it is thought to have happened via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how other respiratory pathogens spread. 12, 29 This is the same hypothesized mechanism of transmission for COVID-19. The spread of MERS and SARS between people has generally occurred between close contacts, similar to the current epidemic in China. According to the WHO, common signs of COVID-19 infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Serious cases can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death. 39 The WHO has advised avoidance of 'unprotected' contact with live animals, to thoroughly cook meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms. Additionally, the CDC issued a travel statement to avoid all non-essential travel to China (Level 3 Travel Notice). 40 Control measures have been put into effect, although the timing of these measures and the relatively rapid spread of the current virus suggests that lessons from the previous SARS and MERS epidemics were not heeded.",

Lessons learned from the MERS and SARS outbreaks can provide valuable insight into how to handle the current epidemic. These include proper hand hygiene, isolation of infected individuals in properly ventilated hospitals (negative pressure rooms), isolation of individuals with suspected symptoms or fever, and preventing direct contact with suspected animal reservoir hosts. Unfortunately, some lessons were not heeded. Transparency was lacking between government officials and the public, which in turn led to the rapid spread of the virus. In contrast, the rapid sharing of the genetic sequencing of the virus has led to faster diagnoses on a global scale. The Chinese government was also able to quickly build hospitals in order to house the infected, although these steps came too late to prevent the spread. The top concern of health officials now should be halting the spread of the infection. Thus far, >40 000 people have been infected, with no end in sight to the epidemic. Basic epidemiological parameters of patients including person, place and time of diagnosis, as well as clinical signs and symptoms, outcome of the infection, severity, exposures and travel histories must be ascertained for each case. The role that live-animal markets have played in the SARS and COVID-19 epidemics highlight the need for a paradigm shift in China away from their use. Closure or suspension of these markets would be the most conservative approach to preventing zoonotic transmission, however China has a long history of live markets, and their permanent ban is unlikely. In this case, the use of proper hygiene and protocols for limiting animal-to-human contact would be ideal, as well as increased epidemiologic surveillance and monitoring. More research should be carried out on the development of effective methods to provide early and timely detection of such diseases. These methods have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Future research should attempt to address the uses and implications of IoT technologies for mapping the spread of infection. Necessary effective measures need to be taken to avoid the unpredictable risk of continuing outbreaks in China and the possibility of a local outbreak turning into a global pandemic.
