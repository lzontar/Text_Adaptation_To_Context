In particular, there is the argument that collective selfishness, thoughtless behaviour, and over-reaction would make the effects of COVID-19 much worse. The same kinds of claims have been made in relation to other kinds of emergencies, such as fires, earthquakes, and sinking ships. We argue that in these cases as well as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, other factors are better explanations for fatalitiesnamely under-reaction to threat, systemic or structural factors, and mismanagement. Psychologizing disasters serves to distract from the real causes and thus from who might be held responsible. Far from being the problem, collective behaviour in emergenciesincluding the solidarity and cooperation so commonly witnessed among survivorsis the solution, one that should be harnessed more effectively in policy and practice.",

Thus, back in the early days of COVID-19, many commentators argued that collective 'panic' would potentially be more disastrous than the pandemic itself, through its effects on markets, availability of goods, 2 relations between different groups, 3 and crime. 4 'Panic'meaning selfish, thoughtless behaviour, and over-reactionwas said to be as 'contagious' as the virus itself. 5 Such collective psychology would therefore turn an emergency into a disaster.",

The Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire of 1942, in which 492 people died, has been presented in psychology textbooks as an embodiment of the received wisdom that 'most deaths in night-club fires are due to crowd panic'. Chertkoff and Kushigian's (1999) detailed re-analysis of events suggests instead failure of management of two types. First, there was mismanagement of space. The emergency exit door was locked. The windows were also nailed shut to prevent people leaving without paying their tab. Second, there were failures of communication. There were no exit signs or training in emergency evacuation, so when staff tried to help lead survivors out, they could not find the fire exit. In the official investigation, the major causes of the loss of life were said to be the locked doors, the unfamiliarity and inaccessibility of normal exits, and the jamming of the revolving door.",

'Panic' explanations once dominated, but a recent systematic review cites as the most common causes of fatalities not collective psychology but overcrowding, closure of exits, congestion at bottlenecks, deficiencies in safety barriers, and lack of coordination with local authorities (de Almeida & von Schreeb, 2019) . Notoriously, the fatal crush at Hillsborough in 1989 was initially explained by some in terms of the disorderly behaviour of fans. But it was later demonstrated that disproportionate concern among authorities with preventing football hooliganism led to neglect of crowd safetyincluding the disastrous decision to let fans into an already overcrowded terrace. 7 In short, Hillsborough, like Cocoanut Grove, did not happen because of failings at the level of collective psychology.",

When the World Trade Center was subject to a terrorist attack in 1993, the evacuation was relatively slow (Aguirre, Wenger, & Vigo, 1998) . Subsequently, regular drills were introduced so that people became familiar with the locations of emergency exits. This measure helped make the 9/11 evacuation so successful. 8 In the case of mass casualty decontamination following a chemical incident, failure of responders to communicate effectively has led to reduced public compliance with the procedure, increasing risk of fatalities (Carter et al., 2015) . The solution has been to train responders with the skills to communicate to the public both why decontamination is needed and how to carry it out (Drury et al., 2019) .",

Many people had to cram into Tube trains to go to work because they needed money to survive and government support schemes were insufficient. People were told they could go out to exercise, but those in urban areas had limited public space. And some employers failed to provide the support for social distancing and hygiene. 16 Those with less income and wealth also live in more crowded homes. 17 The outcomes of these systematic inequalities are predictable: Poorer people have repeatedly been shown to be more vulnerable to infection and more likely to die. 18 These inequalities have persisted into the second phase of lockdown (from May 2020), with lower income people being less able to work from home and more likely to be in jobs that bring them into contact with others. 12 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dhsc-and-phe-statement-on-coronavirus 13 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext 14 The use of the term 'panic' in this case illustrates why it is seen as an unhelpful concept by disaster researchers (Chertkoff & Kushigian, 1999) ; the judgement about whether a behaviour is an overreaction is either subjective since criteria are unclear (how much shopping does one really need?) or post hoc (and therefore not explanatory). 15 https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/opinion/why-stockpiling-is-not-the-crazy-selfish-behaviour-that-it-seems/3483 16 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52243179 17 https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/04/coronavirus-spread-map-city-urban-density-suburbs-rural-data/609394/ 18 https://www.health.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/deaths-from-covid-19-in-the-most-deprived-areas Finally, there is evidence of a specific mismanagement in the form of failure of communication.

There have been many reports of mutual social support by members of the public during the COVID-19 crisis. 22 Reviews suggest that cooperation among survivors is very common in emergencies and that members of the public save more lives than professional responders (Drury et al., 2019) . But, in some emergencies, people compete, push, and even trample each other. What are the conditions for this to occur? Chertkoff and Kushigian's (1999) comparison of different evacuations found that there was more competition when exits were narrow and unfamiliar. We also know that people compete more and coordinate less in evacuations when they are positioned psychologically as individuals rather than as group members. As Mintz (1951) shows, when an evacuating crowd blocks the exit, this can be explained in terms of the prevalence of individual competition in a collective setting (rather than in terms of excessive emotion). In these cases, then, the emergency ends badly due to the absence of collective psychology (i.e., lack of coordination and cooperation).",

In mass evacuations, the larger the group, the slower the egress, because speed is reduced through people interacting with each other (Aguirre et al., 1998) . And the motivation to give support to other survivors can lead some to take risks with their personal safety; so, what is good for the collective in emergency is not always good for particular individuals (Drury, Cocking, & Reicher, 2009). 23 In the case of COVID-19, the risk to the individual from supporting the group is clear where that supportive behaviour involves physical proximity (whether delivering food or giving emotional support face-to-face).",

Under-estimation of risk has sometimes been characterized as an 'optimistic bias' (Kinsey, Gwynne, Kuligowski, & Kinateder, 2019) . But in a context where emergency events are rare (i.e., most of the time), it is reasonable to assume that 'it won't happen to us'. This assumption can reverse when emergency events become more commonfor example, in 2017 after a spate of terrorist attacks in London, hundreds of people in Oxford Street fled from a noise that turned out to be harmless. In general, then, the extent to which information concerning a threat is seen as plausible is a function of the broad social context of dangers. Expectations of danger are raised (and the readiness to flee or take other action is greater) in a context of recent incidents relevant to our social group.",

Based on what we know about social influence processes in other contexts (Bruder et al., 2014) , in the case of COVID-19, it is plausible to suppose that the sight of others in our community routinely observing (or ignoring) social distancing regulations, for example, is likely to send a strong signal to us around the safety of doing the sameparticularly where we identify with the community or see these exemplars as prototypes.",

The existing literature on disasters does not support this view, and prima facie major problems in the COVID-19 response and outcomes can be better understood otherwisein terms of (political) under-reaction, systemic issues, and mismanagement.",

Rather than a neutral description of how people actually behave, it is best understood as part of a particular discourse or cultural representation, one which psychologizesand indeed pathologizespublic responses in emergencies and disasters. Given what is known about under-reaction, systemic factors, and mismanagement in emergencies, to emphasize instead the role of collective 'bad behaviour' has clear ideological functions. In naturalizing fatalities, it distracts from the real causes and thus from who might be held responsible for mismanagement, instead blaming the victims. The irony, of course, is that, far from being the problem, collective psychology in emergenciesthe solidarity and cooperation so commonly witnessed among community members and strangersis usually the solution. Collective psychology therefore can and should be harnessed more effectively in policy and practice in the COVID-19 response (Elcheroth & Drury, 2020 )through framing both the threat and the solution in collective terms, and through emphasizing shared norms around collective well-being and safety (Drury et al., 2019) .
