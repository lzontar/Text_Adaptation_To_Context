Nonetheless, the diversity of viral agents that cause pulmonary disease is extremely broad, and continues to expand (Table 13-1) . Several newly recognized viral pathogens have been identifi ed in the past two decades that are among the most feared and lethal of all emerging infections, including those caused by Hantaviruses, Nipah virus, and SARS coronavirus. Conversely, certain viral infections, particularly those that occur in vulnerable patient cohorts, have diminished during this same interval. For example, the U.S. incidence of varicella pneumonia has declined more than 65% since universal childhood vaccination for varicella was implemented in 1995, and advances in the clinical management of transplant recipients have reduced the incidence of cytomegalovirus pneumonia.",

Most pediatric cases of adenovirus pneumonia occur between 6 months and 5 years of age, and serotypes 3, 7, and 21 are the most common causes of pneumonia in this patient cohort. Serotypes 3 and 7 are particularly pathogenic adenoviruses that can cause disseminated and often fatal disease in previously healthy children. In adults, pneumonia is generally associated with serotypes 3, 4, and 7. Periodic epidemics of adenovirus pneumonia in young adults have been identifi ed, particularly among military recruits. In a manner similar to other pathogens, adenoviruses take advantage of impaired or destroyed immune systems to establish persistent and disseminated infections in immunocompromised hosts. Immunocompromised patients are also susceptible to a broader range of different adenovirus serotypes. Because some adenoviruses establish latency in lymphoid tissues and the kidneys of their host, it is believed that many, possibly most, cases of clinical disease caused by adenoviruses in immunocompromised patients are reactivated infections.

Affected airways may be occluded by homogeneous eosinophilic material, mixed infl ammatory cells, detached epithelium, and cellular debris. The lamina propria of bronchi and bronchioles is typically congested and infi ltrated by predominantly mononuclear infl ammatory cell infi ltrates. Bronchial serous and mucous glands are also often involved and show necrosis and mixed infl ammatory infi ltrates. As the infection progresses, there is involvement of the more distal pulmonary parenchyma, forming foci of bronchocentric necrosis with hemorrhage, neutrophilic and mononuclear cell infi ltrates, and karyorrhexis. These fi ndings occur against a background of diffuse alveolar damage. Adenoviruses form intranuclear inclusions in respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, in the acinar cells of bronchial glands, and in alveolar pneumocytes, and are generally most abundant at the viable edges of necrotic foci. On hematoxylin-eosin stain, early inclusions appear as small, dense, amphophilic structures surrounded by a cleared zone and peripherally marginated chromatin, similar to herpetic inclusions. As the cellular infection progresses, the inclusion becomes larger (as large as 14 microns in some cells) and more basophilic, and the margins of the nuclear membrane become blurred to form the characteristic \"smudge cell\" (Figure 13 -1B).",

Mucocutaneous herpetic infection generally precedes HSV pneumonia, and aspiration of virus-containing secretions into the lower respiratory tract is believed to be the most frequent cause of pulmonary infection with HSV; however, oral lesions may be absent in patients with herpetic laryngotracheitis and bronchopneumonia.

Newborn infants, severely immunosuppressed or burned patients, and patients with severe trauma are at greatest risk of developing HSV pneumonia.

VZV also establishes latent infection within satellite cells and neurons of the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate under various conditions to cause herpes zoster, a painful unilateral vesicular eruption distributed in a dermatomal distribution. Although chickenpox is usually a relatively benign infection in children, adult patients are approximately 25 times more likely than children to develop pneumonia. Pneumonia occurs in approximately 10-15% of adults primarily infected with VZV; however, the incidence of pneumonia in bone marrow transplant recipients and acute leukemia patients may be as high as 30-45%. The greatest risk of severe disease and pneumonia occurs in those patients with chronic lung disease, immune-suppressing conditions, neonates, and pregnant women. The occurrence of pneumonia during herpes zoster is rare, and limited primarily to profoundly immunosuppressed patients, particularly bone marrow transplant recipients. VZV pneumonia develops 2 to 7 days following the onset of rash and is characterized by fever, cough, tachypnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Massive pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary infarcts are frequent terminal events. Hematopoietic cell transplant recipients may present with signs of visceral dissemination and pneumonia 1 to 4 days before the localized cutaneous eruption of herpes zoster appears, and lower respiratory tract disease has been described in the absence of skin lesions, particularly in neonates and bone marrow transplant recipients.",

Serologic surveys have shown that 90-100% of children aged 5 years and older have antibodies to HPIV-3, and about 75% have antibodies to HPIV-1 and -2. The different HPIV serotypes differ in clinical presentations, with HPIV-1 and HPIV-2 most frequently associated with outbreaks of croup and HPIV-3 more often associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia. HPIV-4 is infrequently detected, possibly because it is less likely to cause severe disease. The incubation period is generally from 1 to 7 days. The HPIVs can also cause repeated infections throughout life, usually manifested by an upper respiratory tract illness (e.g., cold and sore throat). Serious lower respiratory tract disease (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis) can also occur with repeat infection, especially among the elderly, and among patients with compromised immunity.",

However, the term \"viral hemorrhagic fever\" (VHF) is usually reserved for systemic infections characterized by fever and hemorrhage caused by a special group of viruses transmitted to humans by arthropods and rodents. VHFs are febrile illnesses characterized by abnormal vascular regulation and vascular damage and are caused by small, lipid-enveloped RNA viruses. This syndrome can be caused by RNA viruses belonging to four different families that differ in their genomic structure, replication strategy, and morphologic features (Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Filoviridae). Arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and fi loviruses are negative-stranded, whereas fl aviviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses. Hemorrhagic fever viruses are distributed worldwide, and the diseases they cause are traditionally named according to the location where they were fi rst described. The oldest and best known is yellow fever virus; others include Lassa fever, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Ebola, and dengue viruses. The distributions of the individual VHFs are related to the distributions of their specifi c arthropod and rodent vectors.",

Only one type of HA and one type of NA are recognized for infl uenza B. Infl uenza A occurs in both pandemic and interpandemic forms. The epidemiologic pattern of in-fl uenza in humans is related to two types of antigenic variation of its envelope glycoproteins, namely antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Fortunately, pandemics, defi ned as worldwide outbreaks of severe disease, occur infrequently and result from antigenic shift and emergence of new potentially pandemic infl uenza A viruses that possess a novel HA alone or in combination with a novel NA. Interpandemic infl uenza occurs virtually every year as a result of antigenic drift resulting from point mutations in the surface glycoproteins, and emergence of new strains related to those circulating in previous epidemics. This enables the virus to evade the immune system, leading to repeated outbreaks during interpandemic years.",
