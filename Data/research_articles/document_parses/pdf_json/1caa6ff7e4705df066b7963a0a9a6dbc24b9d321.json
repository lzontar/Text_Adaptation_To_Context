We adopt our states using the clinical states as described by the CDC and also introduced by the SEIR model of Hill. 3,8 A susceptible patient can be infected with COVID-19 only after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 by a contagious patient. If an individual is exposed to COVID-19, then s/he will move to the Exposed (E) state, and stay there during the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. The individual may transmit the virus during the last several days of the incubation period, as evidenced by the literature. 9-12 After the incubation period is over, the individual becomes symptomatic with mild to moderate symptoms. There is a possibility (also representing the limited availability of COVID-19 testing) that the symptoms will be very mild that the individual will not be tested and the case will not be confirmed by health authorities, which is represented by the Infected with mild to moderate symptoms that is undetected (IM-) state. If the mild symptoms lead to testing that confirms the case, the patient moves to Infected with mild symptoms that is detected (IM+) state.

This is because, we assume that patients with severe symptoms require hospitalization and will stay in the hospital throughout this episode of the illness. We assumed that the probability of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to a health care worker is 0 because due to heightened awareness of COVID-19 in the hospitals, patient to health care worker transmission possibility is very low. Furthermore, there is little impact of this parameter on the overall epidemic, therefore we made this simplifying assumption. -If the patient is experiencing critical symptoms, we assumed that the probability of transmitting SARS-COV-2 to a health care worker is 0. These patients are assumed to be receiving care in the ICU setting and there was not sufficient information to estimate its value. Furthermore, there is little impact of this parameter on the overall epidemic, therefore we made this simplifying assumption. With these assumptions, the key input for transmissibility is the probability of transmitting SARS-COV-2 from a patient experiencing mild to moderate symptoms to a susceptible individual when the patient is tested and confirmed positive with COVID-19. For this purpose, we followed a multi-step approach to adjust this parameter. We first started our parameter adjustment using the baseline estimate of R0 for COVID-19 as 2.6, which uses data from early days of the epidemic in China. 14 We then used our model's base input parameter values to find the probability of transmitting SARS-COV-2 from a patient experiencing mild to moderate symptoms to a susceptible individual such that the theoretical R0 value is 2.6, as listed next: there are 10 close contacts per person per day, duration for mild to moderate symptoms is 6 days, the transmission rate for patients experiencing severe or critical symptoms is 0. We found that when the probability of transmitting SARS-COV-2 from a patient experiencing mild to moderate symptoms to a susceptible individual is equal to 0.0418, the theoretical R0 value would be equal to 2.6 with these parameter settings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1800, "end": 1802, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Details of Parameter Estimation"}, {"text": "Note that for this calculation, we did not account for the probability of transmitting disease from asymptomatic patients or from patients who experience mild to moderate symptoms and are not tested positive for COVID-19.

This R0 is still within the range of reported R0 values, that vary between 1.5 and 6.5. 13, 14 In particular, a recent study based on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy reported an R0 value of 3.47 (when a SIR model is used) for the early days of the epidemic. 15 Similarly, a recent study estimated the median R0 value for Wuhan region as 5.7. 16 Therefore, we concluded that our transmission parameters are within the acceptable range.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 393, "end": 396, "text": "13,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 397, "end": 399, "text": "14", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 562, "end": 564, "text": "15", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Details of Parameter Estimation"}, {"text": "An important input to COVAM is adherence to social distancing measures.

COVAM does not have the ability to differentiate such behaviors from less frequent traveling. Our primary source for this parameter is traveling distance and keeping at least 6-feet distancing during person-to-person interactions.

For example, Google Mobility Report provides the data on the percentage change in the number of visits to different types of destinations including retail & recreation, grocery stores, parks, transit stations, and workplace. 19 For example, for NYC, the data from Google website (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) shows significant increase in adherence to social distancing measures over time especially in late March and April. Unacast, on the other hand, reports three metrics to measure the efficacy of social distancing measures: change in average mobility (based on distance traveled), change in non-essential visits, and difference in encounter density. 17 Since all of these sources report different metrics and values for adherence to social distancing, we estimated the input values (as reported in Table 2 in the main text) using calibration. Our calibration procedure evaluated the adherence inputs that are higher than reported mobility values by these three different sources. This is because, as explained before, while our adherence parameter is a proxy for individuals' behaviors that reduce the transmission of the disease such as wearing masks and frequent hand washing, none of the data sources on mobility reported such behaviors. Instead, they only report data related to the reduction in the frequency of daily contacts. Our calibration procedure selected the adherence to social distancing values that allowed COVAM to match observed number of cases over time.

Adherence to social distancing measures changes on a daily basis for each region therefore, it is adjusted at regular time points as shown in Table 2 in the main text. Our modeling approach is very flexible therefore it is possible to match the observed number of cases almost perfectly by simply adjusting adherence to social distancing on a daily basis or changing the probability of testing for each day. However, we preferred to not perfectly match the observed data to prevent overfitting. For example, the model's predicted number of cases in the early days of the pandemic in Dane County are higher than observed number of cases, which is most likely due to the very limited testing in the early days.

Each replication of the simulation can last from a few seconds to an hour on a standalone desktop PC depending on the population size and number of infections. Although COVAM currently represents simple behaviors for the agents, it can easily be used to represent more complex behaviors by the agents. For example, the model is able to define the adherence levels of the individuals to the outcomes associated with COVID-19, i.e. when there are many cases/deaths in a week, individuals could become significantly more compliant with the social distancing measures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COVAM Mechanics"}, {"text": "Given the lack of data on SARS-CoV-2, health systems and public health officials rely on mathematical models for policy decisions such as school closures and the extent and timing of social distancing measures. Most commonly used models compartmentalize the transmission and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Examples include the susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model and the susceptible-exposed-infective-recovered (SEIR) model, which extends SIR model by including a compartment representing the latent period. 43 After the sudden rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., several models specific to COVID-19 were quickly developed and made available online. 3-5 Some of the models provide both U.S. and state-specific prediction. 5 However, given vast within-state variability in transmission dynamics and adherence to social distancing, these models are severely limited in their applicability to local settings. 6 Some limitations include the assumption of a closed population, the inability to represent dynamic social distancing measures with different adherence levels accurately, and the inability to account for the effect of limited testing capacity on the number of confirmed cases. The major strength of our work is a simple and flexible model that incorporates similarities to existing compartmental models, but allows additional granularity when simulating critical features, thus capable of addressing complex policy questions. For example, COVAM can be used to evaluate the impact of increasing testing capacity on COVID-19 control as well as when it would be optimal to implement contact tracing for containing COVID-19 as it explicitly tracks individuals. As the COVID-19 epidemic has spread throughout the world, estimates of disease transmissibility in terms of basic reproduction number (R0) in subpopulations have varied widely. 13,14 Another strength of our ABM approach is that there is no static R0 input. Instead, the model directly models daily interactions and chance of viral transmission at each interaction, allowing these parameters to be varied independently at any point in time, and stratified by age group or other demographic characteristic. This allows evaluation of the impact of specific policy decisions on an epidemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 526, "end": 528, "text": "43", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Comparison of COVAM to other models"}, {"text": "In this section, we present the results of the model validation for the base inputs.
