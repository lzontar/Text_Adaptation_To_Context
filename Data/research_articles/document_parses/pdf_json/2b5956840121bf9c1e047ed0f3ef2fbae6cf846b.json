Table 1 is a suggested list of surgeries that should be prioritized if COVID-19 surges warrant cancellation of most elective surgery. These recommendations, which can be applied in the current and any future situation in which ventilators and other operating room resources are scarce, prioritize moving forward with cases where evidence suggests that even short-term delays may affect patient survival. We also suggest alternatives for the management of common urgent or emergent urologic procedures that may spare the use of ventilators, and consider the use and impact of common urologic treatments on patients during an infectious outbreak.
