Second, the Community Food Action Initiative was part of the ActNow BC program. ActNow BC was the first crossministerial initiative to promote health, created to promote BC as the healthiest jurisdiction ever to host the (2010 winter) Olympics. ActNow BC mandated all provincial government ministries to develop a health initiative, arguing that if health were not addressed through all ministries, the health budget would soon overtake all other budgets. Many ActNow BC initiatives focused on food security. The Community Food Action Initiative is drawn upon heavily in this analysis, as it was the only initiative at that time with the stated intent of working in partnership with civil society; it had one of the broadest food security committee representations in the province; and many interviewees who were involved in other programs were also involved in the Community Food Action Initiative. It was implemented at both province-wide and regional levels.",

This report was remarkable in that it brought together in one document the areas of food insecurity, food sustainability, nutrition and food safety; it reflected current interest in these topics at that time.

At the time, the community nutritionists and civil society representatives who wrote the paper were concerned that the use of the term 'food security' was too frequently associated only with household and individual food insufficiency. 15 Mirroring the origins of the term 'community food security', 16, 17 they sought a more comprehensive term. Food Security Core Programs and the Community Food Action Initiative subsequently adopted the following definition: \"Community food security exists when all citizens obtain a safe, personally acceptable, nutritious diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes healthy choices, community self-reliance and equal access for everyone\" (a definition adapted from Bellows and Hamm 18 ). An adaptation of this definition was also used in the Provincial Health Officer's Report. As these terms are used interchangeably in BC, they are also used similarly in this paper.",

Ritchie and Spencer's framework was found to be congruent with research objectives and policy frameworks posed by many research scholars, including such components as stakeholders, context, drivers, consequences and power; 20-23 it also provided a succinct framework for both the research questions and data analysis.

In the broader analysis, key informant interviews were completed with government, civil society, and food supply stakeholders, most of whom were involved in the food security initiatives under review. However, food supply stakeholders were not involved in the three Public Health initiatives examined in the stakeholder analysis, so were excluded in this stakeholder analysis. Government interviewees consisted of nutritionists, food security managers, Food Protection (food safety) inspectors, and administrators from the three aforementioned levels of Public Health in BC; other ministries with representation were Agriculture, Employment and Income Assistance, and Education. Civil society representatives included representatives from food security networks, health non-governmental organizations (NGOs), media, funders, and those with Aboriginal affiliations. A semistructured interview format using open-ended questions was developed from Ritchie and Spencer's 19 applied policy research categories, focusing on stakeholder mandates, relationships, mediating factors and consequences of the integration of food security into Public Health policies and programs. Questions aimed to elicit organizational responses. Thirty-five out of 38 interviews were conducted in person; 3 were completed by telephone. Interviews were recorded with a digital recorder and transcribed.",

Policies and programs that had previously been led by lower-level Public Health employees and civil society were now integrated into a higher level of Public Health. Two key Public Health NGOs in BC were also involved as partners. Initiatives helped food security to acquire some legitimization within Public Health and at community and municipal levels, including the provision of food security funding to communities. Finally, while still acknowledged as a low government priority, this introduction of numerous food security initiatives within a short period of time supports some legitimization of food security within the government.",

Additionally, health NGOs have a similar \"professional\" health culture to that of Public Health, comprising mainstream health promotion and disease prevention groups, including Public Health employees. Thus, limitations related to public involvement centred primarily on engaging civil society food security networks. Civil society took a strong role in lobbying for the integration of food security into Public Health and anticipated an ongoing collaborative approach. However, many interviewees in both Public Health and civil society saw Public Health as expert-driven and top-down, suggesting that they did not know how to work effectively with the community.

Food security has broad determinants (e.g., economics, food systems, culture). For Public Health to effectively take a leadership role in food security, it must address the determinants of health. This reflects global recommendations. The World Health Organization identifies food as one of 10 social determinants of health, focusing on the issues of both excess intake and food insecurity, with policy implications focusing strongly on food systems. 27 While the literature embraces this shift in scope, as evidenced by this research, in practice there is a growing divide between these calls and the reality for practitioners. The need for a broader lens and understanding reinforces the notion of Muller et al. 28 that when faced with \"numerous policy drivers that impact the food system\", Public Health professionals \"often focus on narrow objectives with disregard for the larger system\". Muller et al. also suggest that Public Health may then focus on the familiar, echoing interviewee comments. Even the Population Health Framework has been criticized in the literature for ignoring some of the broader political and socio-economic forces and contexts in which people live, as well as focusing on top-down expert knowledge (versus lay knowledge). 29 Another key limitation articulated by some interviewees suggested that their trust in Public Health's leadership was diminished by the Food Protection arm of Public Health: their enactment of the Meat Inspection Regulation was seen to impede local food security. Food Protection monitors and regulates food safety standards. These standards are increasingly set at an international level as part of a system of global agrifood governance overseeing the corporate-dominated global food system. 30 As many interviewees from both civil society and Public Health distrust the industrial food system, they questioned Public Health's ability to advocate for a broad notion of food security, given the powerful legislative position of Food Protection within Public Health. Interviewee concerns reflect literature articulating adverse health impacts arising from food safety policy. 28, 30, 31 These findings also mirror global tensions between centralization and decentralization of the food supply. 16, 32 Public Health's limitations in relation to \"public involvement\" and \"collaboration\" narrow the lens with which they analyze and address food security issues, limit and create tensions with their partners, and threaten the source of external pressure needed from outside of Public Health to advance food security. These findings highlight the notion that Public Health limitations have institutional roots. This understanding can lead to less judgement at the individual level, but it also means that mitigating these systemic limitations is more difficult.",

This political paradigm calls for greater engagement of civil society, and for all sectors to work together toward common goals. Gunningham and Sinclair 33, p. 5 define regulatory pluralism as occurring when the \"government harness(es) the capacities of markets, civil society and other institutions to accomplish its policy goals more effectively, with greater social acceptance, and at less cost to the state\". Koc et al. 34 support the adoption of the concept of regulatory pluralism in food policy. Indeed, food security and other initiatives under ActNow BC demonstrate a shift toward regulatory pluralism, in that the government declared that all ministries, and to some extent industry, needed to work toward a greater goal of public health in order to address upwardly spiralling health care costs. Moving toward regulatory pluralism requires governments to be committed to a greater engagement of other sectors. Food policy councils may be an emerging form of regulatory pluralism; they have been effective in bringing together multiple stakeholders at local levels and often incorporate bottomup input. [35] [36] [37] Other approaches were identified by this research to either move toward regulatory pluralism or mitigate Public Health limitations. Public Health should define what outcomes they are capable of working toward and what they are not, within a broader systematic approach to food security. Clear articulation of agendas by all partners will help increase understanding of stakeholder limitations, as well as create mutual agendas. Increasing capacity building for civil society and finding ways to share power will help to strengthen community engagement.",
