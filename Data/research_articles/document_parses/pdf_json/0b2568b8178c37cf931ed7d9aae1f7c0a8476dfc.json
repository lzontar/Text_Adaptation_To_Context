The answer to these questions can enlighten our ability to provide prophylactic interventions to limit transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 as governances look to reopen society and effectively treat patients that have contracted SARS-CoV-2 to limit their progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome that has been a hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Hypertension has been shown to be associated with COVID-19 and its severity in a number of early demographic studies of COVID-19 [1, 2] . It remains unclear if this association is due to the pathogenesis of hypertension or confounded by an associated co-morbidity or medication. In this setting, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), medications commonly used to treat hypertension amongst other disease such as diabetes mellitus and heart failure have also been associated with COVID-19 and its severity. ACEi and ARBs have garnered particular interest given previous studies demonstrating its regulation of the carboxymonopeptidase enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been shown to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells [3, 4] . ACE2 expression is seen throughout the body including the respiratory tract, heart, kidney, endothelium, and intestines. Studies in rats have shown upregulation of ACE2 in cardiac [5, 6] and renal tissues [6, 7] with ACEi and/or ARB therapy, with mixed results in humans [8, 9] . Recent data evaluating gene expression in human lung samples suggest that ACEis lower ACE2 expression further clouding our understanding [10] . Though ACE2 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells, it also serves a protective role in the setting of lung injury through its effect on generating angiotensin 1-7 from angiotensin II and counterbalancing effects of angiotensin II signaling [11] . This leads to the question; \"Is ACE2 expression a risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or protective in limiting COVID-19 severity? M a n u s c r i p t Jung et al. evaluated in-hospital mortality and found mortality rates of 9% in RAASi users and 3% in non-RAASi users but this difference was not present after adjustment for confounders. Given hypertension is noted to be associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality, Jung et al. did a subgroup analysis of hypertensive patients and found in-hospital mortality in this group to be 9% amongst RAASi users and 13% amongst non-RAASi users demonstrating the influence of hypertension and its pathogenesis. A large cohort in Spain evaluating hospital admission with COVID-19 found no impact of RAASi use but upon sub-group analysis found diabetic patients had a lower rate of hospital admission when on RAASi suggesting certain sub-groups could gain benefit from RAASi in setting of COVID-19 [13] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 133, "end": 135, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 803, "end": 806, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 807, "end": 809, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 992, "end": 995, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 996, "end": 998, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1017, "end": 1020, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1023, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1086, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1089, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1233, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1488, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2454, "end": 2458, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The authors noted most of the RAASi use in their study was from ARB with minimal use of ACEi in Korea limiting the extension of the findings to ACEi use.
