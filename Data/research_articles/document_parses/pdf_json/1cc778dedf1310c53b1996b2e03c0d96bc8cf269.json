Her CLL was treated with rituximab initially that was switched to ibrutinib three months earlier but was discontinued a few days before her hospitalization due to palpitations and arthralgia. On admission, she was hypoxic, requiring supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min to maintain oxygen saturation, SpO2 > 93%, and in atrial fibrillation with no hemodynamic instability. Laboratory studies were significant only for elevated CRP at 74 mg/L (normal < 10mg/L). Nasopharyngeal swab specimen for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, but negative for other respiratory viruses. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (Figure 1, panel A) . The patient was enrolled in John 4 the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 expanded access program for convalescent plasma (CCP) on day 9 of her illness and received one dose of CCP. The patient's respiratory status rapidly improved the day following CCP transfusion, maintaining SpO2 on room air.",

Given the radiological appearance of migratory lung infiltrates and rapid improvement with corticosteroids, we hypothesize that this is OP due to the associated hyper-inflammation phase commonly seen in the later stages of COVID-19. 3 Moreover, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia, a subtype of organizing pneumonia is described in COVID-19; which could be the case in our patient, although it cannot be confirmed without a tissue biopsy. 4 Although we conjecture that this is likely the explanation in our case, other plausible mechanisms of OP in our patient are a) an immune activation-like phenomenon following cessation of ibrutinib or b) augmentation of immune response by convalescent plasma. 5 Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are involved in toll-like receptormediated signaling and triggering of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release. 6 John 5 Ibrutinib, a highly potent inhibitor of BTK, is considered to protect against lung injury in COVID-19. 6 Corticosteroids are not currently recommended in the management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 unless there is a separate indication like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or in intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. 7 OP as a delayed presentation of COVID-19, should be considered for which corticosteroids have significant benefit. Moreover, given the increasing use of convalescent plasma, OP as a possible downstream consequence should be investigated.",
