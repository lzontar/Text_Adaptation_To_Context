Although deserving deeper investigations, this molecular mechanism is considered to mediate antimalarial drug activity in vitro on various viruses such as HIV, SARS-CoV-1, and orthomyxoviruses. 16, 17 However, when discussing any potential benefits of interacting with the ACE/ACE2 system, we should acknowledge that the clinical effects of ACE inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 still remain controversial. These drugs may appear attractive to treat cardiovascular diseases by reducing pulmonary inflammation; however, their use may be accompanied by enhanced ACE2 expression that facilitates the viral invasion. 18 Interestingly, as a weak base, hydroxychloroquine increases the intracellular pH, mainly in the acidic organelles such as endosomes/lysosomes (pH 4.5) where it intensively accumulates. Moreover, hydroxychloroquine alkalinizes the phagolysosomes (pH \u223c6.5; known as the lysozomotropic activity) and may thus inhibit the viral cleavage mediated by pH-dependent proteases, disrupt the fusion process and stop the viral replication.

Additionally, azithromycin is responsible for a global amplification of the host's interferon pathway-mediated antiviral responses. Finally, it may alter SARS-CoV-2 entry by interfering between its spike protein and host ACE2 receptor. Very recently, an energetics-based modeling provided high binding affinity for azithromycin at the interaction point between SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2, whereas hydroxychloroquine appeared ineffective to directly inhibit this interaction. 24 Clinical studies have shown the ability of azithromycin to reduce the viral load with demonstrated benefits on patient outcome including accelerated recovery (influenza A infection), reduced respiratory morbidity (respiratory syncytial virus and SARS infections) and improved mortality (Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus infection). 22 Several trials in addition to those testing the hydroxychloroquineazithromycin combination are currently ongoing to investigate the anti-COVID-19 benefits of azithromycin alone or in combination with other drugs, focusing as end points not only on viral load but also on clinical outcomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 232, "end": 240, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Drug 2: Azithromycin"}, {"text": "Interestingly, azithromycin is a known substrate of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), a member of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters superfamily, highly expressed and oriented from the cytosolic to the internal side of the lysosome membrane. 25 Therefore, we hypothesized that azithromycin accumulates more intensively under the ABCB1 trapping effect inside the lysosomes and like hydroxychloroquine, reduces lysosomal acidity and exhibits its antiviral properties. Consistently with our hypotheses, synergistic in vivo and in vitro properties have been attributed to the azithromycin/chloroquine combination, used to protect against malaria and treat sexually transmitted infections. 26, 27 Similarly, the antiviral synergy of the azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine combination was observed in vitro at concentrations achieved in vivo and detected in pulmonary tissues 28 and was shown to accelerate viral clearance in humans in comparison to hydroxychloroquine alone. 1 Thus, azithromycin ABCB1-dependent lysosomal sequestration plus hydroxychloroquine is very likely an optimal combination to hamper the low-pH-dependent steps of viral replication and limit COVID-19 progression.
