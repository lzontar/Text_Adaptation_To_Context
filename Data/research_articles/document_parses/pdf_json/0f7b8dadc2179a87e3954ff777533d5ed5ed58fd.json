Immigrant nurses are essential team players of the global nursing workforce and play a vital role in improving the global healthcare system and providing culturally sensitive care. According to Trines (2018) , the global immigrant population of nurses is 15.2% in the UK, 23.3% in Australia, 26.7% in New Zealand, 18.7% in Switzerland, and 7.7% in Canada. Patel, Ly, Hicks, and Jena (2018) determined that 1.3% to 23.1% Registered Nurses, Nurse Practitioners, Licensed Practice Nurses, and nursing aids in the US are immigrants (non-US born and non-US citizens). Possibly, the actual number of immigrant nurses in the developed countries cannot be estimated accurately because many of these nurses have not obtained the practicing license and are working as personal care attendants, home, and developmental support workers.",

We received a message from one of the immigrant nurses working as a frontline care provider in the most stricken city in the US. She said, \"COVID-19 is all over in our hospital. Many staff nurses are positive, if asymptomatic, in 72 hr-back to work. No more quarantine for 14 days\". Such experiences of both immigrant and non-immigrant nurses may not be uncommon during this public health crisis as all the nurses are working in high-risk environments without adequate personal protective equipment (Bagnasco, Zanini, Hayter, Catania, & Sasso, 2020) . The safety of nurses in hospital and community settings is one of the major concerns for all the governments (Choi, Jeffers, & Logsdon, 2020) and measures have been taken to offer them compensations and additional rights during this pandemic.",

It is believed that the immigrant nurses did not receive quality education, therefore, they are not suitable for the job (Dempster & Smith, 2020; Ghazal et al., 2019; Moyce et al., 2016) . Arguably, this may not be entirely true. For example, nurses from Europe may be equally qualified to practice in the US and the UK and vice versa. Similarly, many low to middle-income countries have well-developed and high-quality nursing education environments that produce highly qualified front line nurses. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many high-income countries have eased their restricted policies concerning education and regulatory requirements and called for more immigrant nurses to combat the pandemic (Dempster & Smith, 2020) . If the softening of migration policies is a consequence of the pandemic, perhaps now is the time that governments and nursing regulatory bodies initiate measures to mitigate the challenges of immigrant nurses in the near future.",
