If they did, then most infectious disease specialists would suffer from this disorder, and apart from seeing the value of frequent handwashing, sneezing in your elbow, and not touching your face, there is no evidence they are more likely to suffer from OCD than anyone else. Yet, the meaning we can attach to these life forms is quite different.

In many situations, it seems relatively harmless, like in children's cartoons that show naughty, delinquent germs running across the screen being chased by heroic white blood cells. Although the personification of viruses and germs has been found to be associated with heightened fears of contamination among non-clinical controls (Riskind & Richards, 2018) , it is unlikely to play any direct causal role in OCD, nor would a tendency to personify viruses and germs be necessarily expected to differentiate between normal and obsessional fears of contamination. However, the personification of viruses and germs illustrates how these life forms are not only a physical threat, but can also represent a psychological threat as an enemy or invader able to threaten the self (Connelly and Macleod, 2004) . Indeed, the wider literature suggests that those with OCD might be particularly vulnerable to experience viruses and germs as a psychological threat due to an already fragile and incoherent identity (Aardema & Wong, 2020) .

Before this time, ideas on the origin of disease were not as established, either viewed as the result of evil influences, or considered to spread through bad air from decaying organic matter. In addition, views on what constituted a contaminant was quite different in earlier times. Prior to the 17 th century, historical records that describe obsessivecompulsive fears of contamination are scarce to non-existent. Instead, earlier accounts more commonly describe a fear of inner corruption as the result of evil influences (Luibheid & Russell, 1982; p. 212; Kempe, 1436 Kempe, /2015 , and later on in theological doctrines derived from the notion of original sin (Bunyan, 1666), as well as secular notions of inner corruption as the \"devil\" that exists inside all of us (McAdams, 1993) . In other words, the historical evolution of OCD suggests that a fear of mental contamination might be more central to an understanding of this disorder than fears of physical contamination. That is, in the obsessional case, physically oriented forms of contamination represent a historical continuation of a fear of inner corruption through other means.",

In addition, improvements in feared selfperceptions during psychological treatment is significantly associated with lessened concerns about physical contamination (Aardema, Wong, Audet, Melli & Baraby, 2018).

Those with phobia do not show the same degree of selectivity. Fears revolve around a consistent objectively quantifiable category of objects or situations where they avoid all spiders, or all heights, or all planes. In contrast, obsessional fears are highly idiosyncratic and domain-specific with variations within even specific subdomains of any particular subtype, like the case of the client who feared the Hep C virus, but showed no heightened concerns about the coronavirus. This high level of selectivity can even have a protective effect against the negative effects of a pandemic as compared to other disorders that are characterized by a more generalized tendency to overestimate threat.",

While threat itself is almost always a concern in OCD, this relates to how the aversive stimulus is perceived to threaten the underlying self-theme.

In other words, obsessional fears arise without there being any direct evidence for risk of infection. For example, a fear of a virus finding its way through the walls, as opposed to feelings of discomfort when someone walks up to you to shake your hands in the middle of a pandemic. In the case of the latter, someone with obsessional fears of contamination will obviously experience anxiety, but this reaction does not necessarily indicate OCD. The thought about being contaminated would be an entirely normal intrusive thought even when it occurs to someone with obsessional fears of contamination. In other words, a truly obsessional reaction occurs not on the basis of direct evidence pertinent to the here and now, but as the result of an overreliance on the imagination that takes real objects, events and facts out of context due to its association with the vulnerable self-theme of inner corruption.",

These guidelines note how the difference between normal and abnormal fears of contamination can be difficult to tell, and given potential risks to clients with engaging in exposure and response prevention (ERP), pharmacotherapy is proposed as a first option for clients with contamination fears. However, the unique features of OCD make a different set of recommendations possible. In particular, there are evidence-based cognitive approaches that align strongly with a cognitive formulation of fears of contamination as outlined in the current paper (O'Connor, Aardema & Pelissier, 2005; Julien, O'Connor, & Aardema, 2016) First and foremost, it would advise that therapists engage in psychoeducational efforts that highlight the difference between normal and obsessional fears of contamination. Learning how to tell the difference between normal and obsessional doubts is already an intrinsic part of inference-based cognitive therapy for OCD (O'Connor & Aardema, 2012) . It teaches those with OCD that obsessions typically occur out-of-context and without any direct evidence justifying the doubt. Specific examples in line with recent events can be provided that illustrate the differences between normal and obsessional fears of contamination. For example, an urge to wash one's hands following grocery deliveries, or after physically bumping into another person in the street, is entirely justified in the context of the current pandemic. It is a concern that occurs in-context with direct evidence for potential contamination, and aligns with the facts about possible contamination. Next, examples can be provided highlighting the unique features of obsessional concerns, but applied to a situation that is neutral to the client.",

That is, since obsessional fears are irrational fears of contamination that occur outof-context and without any direct evidence, there should be no risks in exposing individuals to situations where this applies. This is not exposure with safety behaviors included, but exposure that more specifically target the unique characteristics of obsessional fears.

The model would predict that a fear of of inner corruption, and the specific qualities and traits they fear acquiring, is closely aligned with the negative qualities and psychological meaning ascribed to contracting contaminants like viruses and germs, resulting in the occurrence of out-of-context obsessions and compulsive urges to wash and clean to preserve a normal, unblemished sense of self. In addition, in line with recent findings, it would predict that therapy specifically targeting a The potential effects of the current pandemic on mental health should not be underestimated.",

However, this effect may not be as specific to OCD as assumed, since it is not just a heightened concern about danger that characterizes this disorder, but rather, whether or not threats are associated with an underlying vulnerable selftheme. In some individuals with OCD, recent events might be incorporated or strengthen obsessional narratives leading up to obsessional fears of contamination and contagion, but these can never form any real justification for the reality of an obsession that arises from the imagination. For any specific obsessional effect to occur, a fear of viruses and germs has to hit the person's vulnerable self-theme, and the extent to which it is able to do so remains to be seen.",

It's a fine line between reality and imagination, and yet for some reason, it does not cross over into COVID-19. When I see people walking less than 6 feet away from me, my OCD does not latch onto that. It does seem like this COVID thing puts the OCD in context.
