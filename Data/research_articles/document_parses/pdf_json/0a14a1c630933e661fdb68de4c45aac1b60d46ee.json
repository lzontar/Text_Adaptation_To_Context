World Health Organization soon declared it a worldwide pandemic. 1 The spread of the disease was soon identified as droplet contact. Hence facemasks and respirators are important components of personal protective equipment for HCW. The protection efficacy of facemasks and respirators is of importance as they filter fine airborne particles from reaching the respiratory system and thus prevent interhuman infection. It was generally accepted that N95 respirator is more effective for filtration compared to facemask. 2 A pressure injury is localised damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony prominence. It occurs as a result of intense or prolonged pressure or pressure in combination with shear. It can present as an intact skin with erythema or an open ulcer and painful. 3 The usage of N95 respirator is recommended during aerosol-generating medical procedures performed on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. 4 The long term physiological effect of the N95 has been previously described. 2 However, there has not been any report of nasal bridge pressure ulcers associated with the N95 respirator. We describe a series of five HCW who presented to us with nasal pressure ulcers within a span of 2 weeks. This HCW were all involved in treating COVID-19 positive patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at a designated COVID-19 Hospital. This sudden surge in the number of HCW developing pressure ulcers in such a short duration is both alarming and worrying.",

Then slide fingers down both sides of the nosepiece to seal it against the nose and face. HCW's are advised not to push the respirator against the face. A seal test is done by the HCW to ensure proper fit of the N95 respirator. 5, 6 As the world is currently facing this pandemic together, countries are expectantly running low on personal protective equipment such as N95 respirators. This then propagates new guidelines on extended use and limited re-use of N95 respirators to tide us over this pandemic. 7-10 All our HCW use their N95 for prolonged durations. This is to ensure they do not exhaust the limited supply of N95 respirators that are available. To overcome these issues, we advocate proper personal protective equipment training. This is carried out by our Occupational and Safety Health department who provides the training, which includes proper donning and doffing of N95 respirator. This training and retraining are done on a regular basis for all HCW prior to serving in the COVID-19 wards. This will reinforce the proper use of the N95 respirator and address the insecurities experienced by HCW. As for HCW who have developed the pressure ulcers, we introduced the use of a barrier dressing, DuoDERM Extra Thin. This dressing was selected predominantly because of its physical property. It is strong, yet thin enough to allow a good seal during donning of the N95 respirator.",
