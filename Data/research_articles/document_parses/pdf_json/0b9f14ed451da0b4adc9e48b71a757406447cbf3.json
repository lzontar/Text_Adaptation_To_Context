We sampled and tested rodents (851) and other mammals and found betacoronavirus RNA in 12 rodents. The sequences belong to two separate genetic clusters and are closely related to those of known rodent coronaviruses detected in the region and distantly related to those of human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1. Considering the close human-wildlife contact with many species in and beyond the region, a better understanding of virus diversity is urgently needed for the mitigation of future risks.",

The suspected index case probably contracted the virus at a local seafood and wildlife market in the city, yet the exact species of animal that hosted the virus remains unknown. Phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates a strong likelihood that the reservoir species is a bat, as in the case of the related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2] . An involvement of another intermediate host between bats and humans in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Wildlife and bushmeat markets are common across Southeast Asia, and represent a significant risk for the transfer of zoonotic pathogens between wildlife and humans. Indeed, 75% of all emerging infectious diseases in the past decades have their origin in wildlife, including highly pathogenic influenza viruses (H5N1), ebolaviruses, henipaviruses, and hantaviruses, among others [3] .",

People contact rodents incidentally and intentionally in various ways. In traditional-style homes, especially in rural areas, rodents are often able to easily enter the houses in search of food and shelter. These circumstances promote incidental contact with rodent urine and feces during everyday life when household members clean their houses. Rodents also commonly raid food storage areas, including rice storage huts near paddies. In terms of more direct and intentional contact, some species of rodents, including the Indian giant flying squirrel (Petaurista philippensis), Finlayson's squirrel (Callosciurus finlaysonii), red-cheeked flying squirrel (Hylopetes spadiceus), and others, are hunted or trapped in rural forested areas using traps, guns, sticks, or other implements. Designated for food or for medicinal purposes, depending on the species, the rodents are consumed within the hunter's village or enter the value chain to reach markets. The value chain involves a series of intermediaries that transport animals from small villages to progressively larger populated areas. At the market, animals are sold to locals or to Lao people visiting from other areas of the country, and often to foreign visitors from neighbouring Thailand, China, and Vietnam [8, 9] . Even though the sale of these animals is illegal, Laos attracts many wildlife trade tourists simply because wildlife products are more available. Throughout this value chain, people are exposed to blood, viscera, feces, and saliva of rodents and can be further exposed to these materials during the butchering process, where butchers can accidentally cut themselves with knives, allowing efficient transmission of viruses from rodents to humans to occur [9] . Considering the significant interactions of wildlife and especially rodents with humans in Laos, we were interested in investigating the presence of CoVs in these animals, which can be primary or intermediate hosts for CoVs with zoonotic potential.",

Both versions amplify 387 nt between the primer binding sites. CoV-RNA-positive samples were subjected to a cytochrome b PCR assay to verify the host species.

The rodents belonged to the families Sciuridae (475), Muridae (370), Diatomyidae (5), and Hystricidae (1); the carnivores belonged to the families Viverridae (121), Mustelidae (2), and Felidae (1); the primates belonged to CoV RNA was detected in 12 rodents, which corresponds to 1.4% of the rodents sampled.

We found CoV RNA in swab samples from several of the rodents examined in the study. Earlier, we noted a relatively high number of diverse CoVs detected in various species of bats all over Laos (Supplements 2 and 3) [5] . This corresponds to similar findings in other countries with a tropical climate, and a hypothesis has been suggested that bats may serve as a seeding host for zoonotic CoV infections [15, 16] . The 1.4% prevalence of CoV RNA in rodents was much lower than what had been detected in bats in Laos; however, such observations have been made repeatedly, re-emphasizing the role of bats as a primary CoV source [5, [15] [16] [17] [18] . It is worth noting that we targeted rodents most likely to be in contact with humans and transmit virus and found fewer CoV-RNA-positive animals than in other studies of rodents in the region or elsewhere. A variety of factors may explain the lower incidence of coronavirus-positive animals in this study, including the sample types tested. Studies in which CoV RNA was more frequently detected in rodents have used intestine or fecal matter for their studies, while we tested oral and rectal swab samples [18] [19] [20] . We employed swab sampling to minimize harm to live animals and to avoid any damage to rodents possessed by hunters or market vendors during sampling. Organ collection was rarely feasible, even from dead rodents in market settings, since the size and mass of the animals are used to determine their selling price. While potentially underestimating the actual CoV circulation, swab sampling has the advantage of being minimally invasive, quick, and applicable to all species.",

Nevertheless, the rodent CoVs do fall into the same cluster as human CoVs OC43 and HKU1, and these two human CoVs probably originated from direct or indirect spillover events of rodent viruses sometime in the past [21] . However, we still do not know enough about the molecular mechanisms and drivers of zoonotic events to determine the level of risk with certainty. We conclude that Laos' wildlife harbors diverse CoVs and that a potential for interspecies transmission of viruses and novel diseases exists. Human contact with wildlife such as bats and rodents is common throughout the country, with many rural households consuming bushmeat as a main source of protein and utilizing it as a trade commodity, and this risk potential is particularly relevant. Therefore, behavioral risk reduction, vigilance, ongoing surveillance and research are important to help mitigate the risks of coronavirus zoonotic disease emergence and transmission in the region, especially in the aftermath of COVID-19.
