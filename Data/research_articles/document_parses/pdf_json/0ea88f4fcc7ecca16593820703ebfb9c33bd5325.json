            "text": "Some 35 years ago, Gerard K. O'Neill used the large context of space travel with his undergraduate physics students. A Canadian physics teacher, Art Stinner, independently arrived at a similar notion in a more limited but, therefore, more generally useful sense, which he referred to as the \"large context problem\" approach. At a slightly earlier time the large context problem type of approach had already been used in the study of medicine, pioneered by McMaster Medical School. And the Faculty of Education at the University of Calgary currently uses a large context problem method to deliver its entire curriculum. These approaches are four distinct ways of presenting large context problems to students. This paper will discuss these approaches historically, look at their grounds and their applications, weigh their successes and characterize their limitations. It will try to see what they take most deeply for granted as viable approaches to teaching science, both theoretical and applied. Finally, it will relate these approaches to the constructivist prejudices of our own time, suggesting their relation to earlier forms of philosophical idealism.",

            "text": "In order to answer the large context problem one has to pose many other subordinate problems and answer each of these in turn. Indeed, they may all have to be answered before one can have a plausible answer to the main question or problem, itself. For example, the question suggests that there may be more than merely colonizing the moon or an asteroid or another planet as a means to colonize space. So, the first thing of which one has to conceive is whether or not there are any possible alternatives, for example, \"Could one live in space indefinitely on a space ship or on a space ship writ large, say, a space station, and, if so, what would such a space station look like?\" \"Would a colony on such a space station have advantages over a colony on the moon or an asteroid?\" \"Are there many possible solutions to its design or are there a very limited few?\" \"What minimum or maximum size might it have?\" \"How earth-like might it be?\" \"How would its design differ from the design of a colony on an asteroid or the moon?\" \"What does one mean by design, here?\" \"Are we only interested in the physics LARGE CONTEXT PROBLEMS -APPLICATIONS TO EDUCATION 9 of constructing a space colony or are we interested, as well, in the broadly understood human environment in all its variety of aspects and details?\" Now, you can see that the questions multiply very rapidly, here, and, in O'Neill's case, they did so multiply, and he and his students, using elementary physics and elementary considerations from other disciplines, attempted to answer most of them in the advanced section of his Physics 103 seminar. There is a suggestion by Freeman Dyson (1993) , a close friend of O'Neill, in his celebration of O'Neill's life and work, that O'Neill's reorganization of Physics 103 remains at Princeton to this day. In particular, the Princeton Learning Guides are supposed to follow directly from O'Neill's influence. That may be so, but I can see hardly any use of serious large context problems in the present-day version of that course, which can be read entirely on the web. There are some difficult problems, to be sure, with a lot of help in the guides, but there are none of the problems mentioned by O'Neill in his books, The High Frontier (1977) and 2081 (1981) , which he worked through with his advanced seminar. The problems in today's Princeton learning guides are all the standard problems you could find in any textbook. The gradation of the difficulty of the problems is also similar, and there is no sense in which a very large context is the vehicle from which students are to generate and solve a host of problems that arise when one tries to answer a seriously large-scale problem like \"Is colonizing the moon or an asteroid the best way for us to populate space?\" So, we depend on O'Neill's account of what he was up to in that seminar and in his subsequent work to see his characterization and treatment of such problems. O'Neill, subsequently, became a consultant to NASA on space colonies and on techniques for approaching space, a widespread lecturer, and public figure, and founded an organization to further his approaches to large context problems relating to space. Art Stinner's large context problems have a slightly different cast from those of O'Neill and were devised originally for use in his physics classroom. Although Stinner remarked to me in the early 1970s that he had been inspired by O'Neill, he deviated from O'Neill's conception in a number of ways. (In fact, his recollection now is that he worked quite independently of O'Neill and only subsequently discovered him as a fellow traveller). In particular, while Stinner retains a wide context for his problems, they are not as wide as those of O'Neill. Nor is Stinner interested in using any manner of science necessary to handle his problems. He is interested in physics. So, his large context problems are circumscribed by that interest entirely.",

Stinner reconstructed for his students the physics of busting the dam, specifying a variety of problems which have to be solved in order to land an explosive drum, bouncing along the water, such that its repeated skip distance enables it to hit the dam and blow it up. He subsequently published this problem collection in a British science education journal (Stinner, 1989) to great popular acclaim. Although the context of Stinner's early efforts is less expansive than that of O'Neill, there is a similarity in that, again, a large number of questions have to be asked and answered before the main question, namely, \"Can we devise a scheme actually to blow up the dam?\" can be answered. Perhaps, we should call Stinner's problems medium context problems, though I think the actual terminology large context problems is his, not O'Neill's. Or, perhaps, we should refer to O'Neill's problems as vast context problems.",

We primarily asked the question: \"Given contemporary physics, what sense can we make of faster than light travel for a space ship?\" Again, a large number of intermediate questions arise, including \"Does contemporary physics permit faster than light travel, and if so, what does it imply for physical objects like a space ship?\" \"If contemporary physics does not permit faster than light travel, why not?\" \"Even if we did not have motion approaching the speed of light, what are the implications for star travel at less than light speeds?\" and finally, \"What does such travel imply for payload, for example?\" Subsequently, following the Stinner-Winchester article published in a bumper Christmas issue of The New Scientist, an entire book has been written on the physics of Star Trek by an American physicist (Krauss, 1996) , the bits of which could be considered components of a large context problem, or, at least, a medium context problem. Interestingly, this latter work was written in complete ignorance of our earlier work. Stinner, subsequently, developed many such problems, some of which he has incorporated into a manuscript for a book that will, I trust, be published in the near future.",

O'Neill's concern was to specify problems of vast context of gripping near future importance, such that the answers to the problems were not known in advance but could be tackled to the extent possible by present day physics and technology. Stinner's concern was either: (a) to pick contexts in which one might develop known physics to solve the problems that necessarily arise or actually arose in that context (such as in the case of Dambusters); or (b) to show how known physics might relate to the context of a speculative situation as Star Trek, or travel to or between asteroids, or the impact of a meteorite on the earth or the moon and the like. Klassen is interested in the actual interaction between history and physics as a learning context for students, especially in historical contexts of great breadth and depth. Stinner's latest ventures, namely the writing of manuscripts illustrating imaginary dialogues between great scientists surrounding topics like \"the age of the earth\" or the scientific and social life of great international figures like Count Rumford, suggest that his interest has moved definitely towards the historical, perhaps inspired by, perhaps inspiring, the work of Klassen.",

The approach to education in medicine followed by a Canadian institution, McMaster Medical School, on its founding in 1966, was to teach medicine in context, always bringing in the patient and the larger social and family context in which a patient finds herself or himself. A patient is usually in a family setting, comes from a particular social, religious, linguistic, ethnic, or educational background. A patient has a complex history which is more than the history of the disease process or processes which the patient or his family have previously suffered, about which histories in medicine are characteristically taken. Also, as the recent SARS, mad cow, and West Nile Virus outbreaks in Canada suggest, the context of a disease process may be very large and goes beyond the treatment and, perhaps, cure of an individual patient.",

The task for the student is to ask a complex set of questions, assuming this is a large context problem, and to engage in a series of investigations until what lies behind the breathing difficulties might be determined. These might include determining whether the patient has ever had breathing difficulties before. Has the patient a history of asthma? Has the patient ever been treated for it? Has the patient just moved house or changed residence or recently come to town or gotten any new pets or taken up new activities like riding horses? Or has the patient an occupation that requires, for example, a lot of flying? And does the patient travel by air a lot, sleeping on the plane, and if so, has the patient any leg pain, particularly in the calf region? Has the patient a family? Is the family context helpful and restful, or does it provide a lot of stress in the patient's life? Has the patient any new friends or lovers? Has the patient been in any accidents lately, perhaps automobile accidents? Is the patient in any difficulty with the law? Or are any of her or his family in such difficulty? And so on.

At McMaster, the study of organ systems forms the basis both of the fundamental sciences underlying the study of disease processes in the human context and the study of the pathology relating to those organ systems. But it is always remembered that it is an individual human being with her or his social, psychological, cultural, ethnic, religious, and personal historical context in which the disease processes are studied. Knowing neither of O'Neill nor Stinner's work, since they actually anticipated it, the faculty at McMaster referred to their approach as that of problem-based learning, but clearly, the problems used were of the large context kind. As John Evans, the school's first dean, remarked to me: \"We backed into it. We knew we wanted to teach in an entirely new way, but we had no idea what that was to be other than it would not be the old 'lecture to a 100 students' method.\"",

Also, the study of curriculum follows a case-based approach in which the complex context of the curricular material to be learned and taught is approached. At the beginning of the program, the large context problems which make up the cases are potted, in the sense that the students are given fairly explicit instructions on how to proceed to tackle their cases. They are even supplied with exemplary initial readings from a variety of sources. But they are not supposed to stop there. They are supposed to develop their cases in their own way, finding new problems not identified in the initial materials and, perhaps, investigate such problems. Thus, a graduate of this program should be able, better than the next teacher, to identify complex educational contexts and educational problems or learning difficulties, and to diagnose what is wrong, and to offer plausible solutions to such learning difficulties or educational problems which may be faced by a student or an entire class or sub group in a class of learners.",

Are these presuppositions plausible for the large context games now being humanly played? I think they are. This does not mean that we could not devise educational research to help us determine whether or not they really are as plausible as we take them to be, or whether there are other equally plausible ways to bring about deep, relevant, and nonfragile learning.",

            "text": "The large context approach is sometimes seen, by those with a constructivist view in mind, as a plausible ally, indeed as a very strong version of the constructivist approach. Remember that the constructivist approach does not think that a scientist actually discovers anything, but, in a very human sort of way, makes it, builds it up, or constructs it. Thus, science for such a thinker is a human enterprise all the way through. There is nothing simply out there to be found. There is only what we make of what is out there. And, so, what is out there and what we make of it cannot be separated, in the end. Thus, our imagination, both theoretical and practical, is essentially involved in the human enterprise of science. Indeed, for someone with this view the objects of science -the particles, the laws, and so forth -are in the head of a scientist; they are creations of her or his imagination, albeit constrained in certain ways by the possibilities of our sensing or measuring or extending our senses for observational purposes. Now, when one takes a sociological turn and thinks of the constructions of science as social constructions, either for the furtherance of science itself or for its practical uses, one presumes that science is essentially an enterprise involving many human heads and hands. But whether one is thinking of science as an individual or social enterprise, it remains a species of idealism, not realism. For a realist, the theories of science are, at least, attempts at approaching the truth, if not the truth itself, and scientific theories are assumed to mirror the world. Truth, for a realist like, say, Russell or Rom Harr\u00e9, is a result of the conformity between one's theories and reality, but for an idealist, whether the Kantian, Bradleyian, or Collingwoodian kind, there can be no possible conformity between one's theories and the world, between theory and reality, for the only reality is the reality shaped by our thought and actions, individually or collectively, or both. That is to say, essentially the world is a world which is produced by our imagination, not one simply found in nature, and that is as true of the aspect of the world which we inhabit that we call science as that aspect which we refer to as art, or for that matter, religion.",

            "text": "If constructivism is a species of philosophical idealism, as it certainly appears to be, and if the large context problem approach is a strong version of constructivism in action, then does that necessarily make those following such an approach philosophical idealists? Well, the logic of the situation inclines me to think that they must be. Yet, my knowledge of those actually working in such contexts suggests to me that at least O'Neill, Stinner, Klassen, and those at McMaster Medical School, think of themselves as philosophical realists. Only the Calgary MT program has largely and clearly been drafted by those with a definitely idealist bent. So, I am also inclined to think that the large context adherents are not necessarily, in their own hearts, idealists. But if one looks at what they are saying and doing, perhaps, they are.",
