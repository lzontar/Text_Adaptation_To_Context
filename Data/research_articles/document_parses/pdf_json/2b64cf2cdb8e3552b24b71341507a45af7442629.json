Clinical and radiological presentation: In our cohort, early clinical symptoms at admission were milder than in the general population, with lower rates of fever (67% vs. 88%), fatigue (25% vs. 45.6%) or cough (44% vs. 57.6%) 25 This is consistent with similar findings in the MHD population reported by Wang et al and Yiqiong et al 21,22 , which could be related to the immune system dysfunction MHD patients 22 . While most patients had no evidence of more marked fatigue, a high proportion presented with basal peripheral oxygen saturation under 95% on admission (61%). This finding could be due to the well-known rightward shift of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve in MHD patients 26 . Most patients (85.7%) presented with or developed bilateral pneumonia with the typical radiological pattern of peripheral ground glass bilateral opacities, consistent with other published data. Treatment scheme: To date, no randomized controlled trials have been published comparing different therapies for COVID-19 in patients on MHD therapy. Our study population received number different treatment protocols that are commonly reported. In the general population, Gautret et al.10 reported virological cure in a select cohort of patients but there is very low certainty of the efficacy results with this treatment, mainly due to very high-risk selection bias, making any claims of effectiveness highly uncertain.
