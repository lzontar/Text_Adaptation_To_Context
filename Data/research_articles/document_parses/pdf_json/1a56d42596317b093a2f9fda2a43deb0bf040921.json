It is important to contact patients the day prior to the scheduled nuclear cardiology testing to screen patients by history following latest local infection control recommendations for COVID-19 exposure risk. It is important to contact patients the day prior to the scheduled nuclear cardiology testing to ensure that the patient is not experiencing clinical signs (fever) or symptoms (cough, dyspnea, unusual fatigue, myalgia, diarrhea, anosmia, hyposmia, dysgeusia, or ageusia) suggesting possible occult COVID-19 infection, and that they have not been exposed to any case or high-risk subjects in the preceding 2 weeks, and have not travelled to high COVID risk areas (Table 1 ). An equally important consideration is the potential risk of the patient being exposed to COVID-19 infection through exposure to the nuclear laboratory equipment and laboratory personnel. Suggest patients to arrive for the test alone, if feasible. If the patient must be accompanied, the accompanying person should also be screened for history of COVID-19 exposure risk. Depending on Is your sense of smell less than it usually is? Is your sense of taste less than it usually is? Have you been exposed to any person with the virus in the last 2 weeks? Have you been exposed to any person who has a high risk of getting the virus, in the last 2 weeks? Have you travelled to any place where a lot of people have COVID-19? During this pandemic, with hospital resources stretched in many parts of the world, there is limited role for performing nuclear cardiac stress tests in patients who are known to have active COVID-19 virus infection. The results of nuclear cardiology procedures would be very unlikely to alter short-term patient management in most patients with active COVID-19 infection.

They are also attempting to conserve cleaning and decontamination chemicals as these resources are of limited supply. Thus, patients who do not have an urgent need for testing should have their testing deferred. Procedures with a potential to change management within the next few weeks and could impact short-term prognosis should be performed. Procedures that have a low probability of identifying serious abnormality that can change management acutely, for which benefit would primarily be over the intermediate or long term, can be postponed.

Decisions are made based on clinical judgment on expected benefit to guide management, on the urgency of the test, and in discussion with the referring clinician.
