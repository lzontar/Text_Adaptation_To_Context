There were seven research themes in the retrieved publications; six for burnout and one for compassion fatigue. Approximately 36% of the retrieved publications were about nurses; 36% were about physicians, 10% were about medical residents and the remaining did not include a specific profession. The retrieved publications received an average of 22.2 citations per article. Four of the top 10 active journals were in the field of nursing and two in the field of general medicine, one in public health, one in neurology, one in psychology, and one was multidisciplinary. The USA ranked first with 1292 (29.3%) articles followed by Spain (n = 248; 5.6%) and the UK (n = 247; 5.6%). Mayo Clinic was the most active institution (n = 93; 2.1%) followed by Harvard University (n = 46; 1.0%) and University of Washington, Seattle (n = 45; 1.0%).

            "text": "Burnout (BO), the opposite of wellbeing, is defined as an emotional and behavioral impairment in response to the prolonged and high level of exposure to occupational stress [1, 2] . Burnout encompasses feelings of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced professional efficacy [1, 3] . Several national studies indicated that BO has reached high levels among healthcare providers and resulted in documented negative effects on patients' health [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Nurses are known to be at higher risk of developing BO than other professions due to high responsibilities and work demand [10, 11] . Compassion fatigue (CF) has been defined as a state of physical or psychological distress in caregivers or rescuers, which occurs as a consequence of an ongoing and snowballing process in a demanding relationship with needy individuals [12] . Burnout and CF are closely related and overlapping. A systematic review of the prevalence of BO and CF among professionals in intensive care units found a wide range of prevalence data among different studies due to lack of unity in measurement and \"lack of common understanding of the theoretical constructs, which is reflected by the variously defined (and interpreted) negative outcomes of providing care in the ICU setting among the included studies\" [13] . The findings of the systematic review made the door open for the true prevalence of BO and CF in published studies due to the complexities in measuring and defining the outcome of emotional distress. However, it is believed that BO and CF have different underlying mechanisms. Burnout is thought to develop from occupational factors that could lead to lack of enthusiasm and productivity, whereas CF results unknowingly and from being in a caregiver role leading to inability to get engaged in a caring relation [14, 15] .",

The US Critical Care Societies Collaborative (CCSC) acknowledged the importance of BO and other psychological disorders in critical care health-care professionals and published a statement calling for publications that would focus attention on this issue to (1) raise awareness of BO within the critical care community and (2) inform multiple stakeholders of their potential roles in reducing BO and its negative consequences in health-care professionals and their critically ill patients [21] . Investing in the wellbeing of healthcare providers is important because BO and CF negatively affect all components of the health system including patient satisfaction and health cost [4, 5, 7, [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

The quotation marks were used to indicate the specific keyword or phrase while asterisk was used as a wild card to retrieve similar terms. Examples of keywords or phrases related to healthcare providers included: health*, nurs*, physician, doctor, pharmac*, \"healthcare\", \"medical\", resident, clinician*, paramedic, hospital, \"ICU\", emergency, surgeon, orthopedic, residency, surgical, oncology, neurology, neurologist, \"medicine\", oncologist, psychiatrist, midwife, clinic. These keywords were followed by an exclusion step. In the current study, all documents on medical or nursing students were excluded since the focus was on healthcare providers and medical or nursing students are not yet an official healthcare provider. The current study was limited to journal publications. Therefore, books, book chapters, and conference abstracts were all excluded. The study period was defined as all times until 2020.

The criteria included the absence of any false-positive (irrelevant) publication in the top 200 cited publications and the absence of false-negative (missing publications) publications. The search query utilized title search and therefore the presence of false-positive results was minimum. The use of certain phrases such as \"depletion of energy\" was associated with certain false-positive results. To avoid this, a certain constraint was added with the phrase \"depletion of energy\". The constraint was the presence of the keyword \"burnout\" or \"compassion fatigue\" in the abstract of the publications having the phrase \"depletion of energy\" in the title. Validation for the absence of false-negative results (missing data) was carried out using the profile of most active authors in this field. In the current study, Shanafelt, T.D.; Dyrbye, L.N.; and West, C.P. were among top 10 active authors and were used in the validation step by comparing the number of publications retrieved for each one of them (78; 43; and 37 respectively) with the actual number of relevant publications present in their personal Scopus profile. This process was carried for the top 10 active authors and yielded a significant and strong correlation (p = 0.003; r = 0.97) between the number of publications retrieved and the actual numbers present in active authors' profiles.

The current study showed a steep increase in the number of publications after 2005. The steep growth in the number of publications is, in part, due to the natural growth of science, increased number of researchers and the genuine demand to increase the efficiency of health services and patient satisfaction. Healthcare providers are required to do more than just patient care. A national survey on physician satisfaction and burnout revealed that 87% of physicians identified paperwork and other administrative activities as the leading cause of BO and stress [40] . The increased global health challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, infectious diseases outbreaks, hundreds of millions of refugees, and conflicts and wars in several parts of the world increased the pressure on healthcare workers which could be listed as one potential reason for increased publications in this field.",

The MBI has shown excellent psychometric properties [41] and is now considered the standard measurement of BO. Compassion fatigue and satisfaction were a separate theme. Compassion is considered fundamental to nursing practice and failure to have compassion can lead to distress and decreased job satisfaction [42] . In the current study, compassion fatigue was represented by one theme while remaining six themes were about BO suggesting that literature on compassion fatigue was less than 15% (~660) of the total number of the retrieved publications. A recent study found 652 publications on CF using the Web of Science database and title/abstract search strategy [43] . Several studies have pointed out the limited number of publications on CF [15, 44] . A third important theme was coping strategies. Several approaches have been suggested to manage burnout among healthcare providers. The strategies include interventions at the individual and/or organizational levels [45, 46] . Intervention programs for reducing burnout at the individual level include a cognitive behavioral approach, coping skills and social support. The organization-directed programs focus on enhancing the work environment and decreasing job demands [39, 47, 48] .",

Studies on BO among nurses were mainly published in few specialized nursing journals. In contrast, documents on physicians were published in a wide range of journals including general medicine, health services, surgery, public health, psychiatry, and health management. This is one possible reason for the presence of four specialized nursing journals in the top 10 active journals.",

This was expected given the gap in research capabilities and funding between these countries and other ones in low-and middle-income category. The high number of publications in these countries does not mean that the prevalence of burnout or compassion fatigue among healthcare providers is higher than that in other countries. It might be the opposite. The work load of healthcare providers in low-and middle-income countries is high given the limited number of physicians and nurses in these countries. Furthermore, the lack or inadequate technology in some low-and middle-income countries adds the burden of documentation and follow up for healthcare providers in these countries. The limited resources and the volatile political and economic situations in many of these countries add up to the stress among healthcare workers in these countries. The limited number of publications from low-and middleincome countries could be attributed to lack of research experts, funding, or absence of an observatory health In ranking system equal values were given the same rank and one rank is skipped body concerned with the efficacy of the health system and satisfaction of the patient with reasonable cost [49] [50] [51] [52] .",
