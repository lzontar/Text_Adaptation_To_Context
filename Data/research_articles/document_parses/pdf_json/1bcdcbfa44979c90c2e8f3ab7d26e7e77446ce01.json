The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200-5,000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 \u00d7 10 3 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 \u00d7 10 3 -8.2 \u00d7 10 4 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 \u00d7 10 2 -2.5 \u00d7 10 3 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5,000 mL.

This discrepancy in the results could be due to the difference in the initial volume of water samples used for concentration. The volume of secondary-treated wastewater samples (5,000 mL) filtered was 25 times greater than that of the influent samples (200 mL), which leads to higher LOD for the influent samples (4.0 \u00d7 10 3 -8.2 \u00d7 10 4 copies/L) as compared to LOD for the secondary-treated wastewater samples (1.4 \u00d7 10 2 -2.5 \u00d7 10 3 copies/L).

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in the positive secondary-treated wastewater sample was two orders of magnitude lower (2.4 \u00d7 10 3 copies/L; Ct of 39.96 in only one of two PCR wells) than that reported in a previous study in Spain (2.5 \u00d7 10 5 copies/L) (Randazzo et al., 2020) . Randazzo As of June 1, Yamanashi Prefecture has been one of the prefectures with relatively low COVID-19 prevalence in Japan. Lower infection prevalence could be responsible for the lower detection ratio of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples in this study. Nevertheless, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (even in low concentration) that corresponded to the peak of daily new cases of infection provided an assurance that even in the areas of low prevalence, WBE can be used as tracking or warning tools for monitoring the status of COVID-19 prevalence in a community. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater has been reported from a country with a low prevalence of COVID-19 cases, and even prior to COVID-19 cases had been reported (Randazzo et al., 2020) .

Besides these determinants, some country-specific factors, such J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Despite the successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in secondary-treated wastewater, it is uncertain if the detected viral RNA was infectious at the time of sampling. Besides, secondary-treated wastewater is further chlorinated before being discharged to an open water body. Coronaviruses are generally known to be sensitive to chlorine and inactivated relatively faster in water compared to non-enveloped viruses, such as PMMoV (La Rosa et al., 2020) . Wang et al.

Chlorine-based disinfectants, such as household bleach, chloroxylenol, chlorhexidine, and benzalkonium chloride, were found effective for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (Chin et al., 2020).

For this purpose, PMMoV was selected as an indicator virus, considering its extremely high abundance in wastewater(Kitajima et al., 2018). The EMV method outperformed the adsorption-direct RNA extraction method with approx. 2.4-log 10 higher observed concentrations of indigenous PMMoV RNA in the samples. The adsorption-direct RNA extraction method was expected to work well as the recovery of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) was high in a recent comparison study, although HA filter (0.45-\u00b5m pore-size, 47-mm diameter electronegative membranes) was used (Ahmed et al., 2020b), while AA filter (0.8-\u00b5m pore-size, 90-mm diameter electronegative membranes) was used in the current study. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV is a non-enveloped RNA virus. Besides, PMMoV is negatively charged, whereas coronaviruses are positively charged at neutral pH. Thus, the recovery of an enveloped surrogate virus with a similar structure to SARS-CoV-2, such as MHV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and Pseudomonas phage \u03a66, should be evaluated in future studies(Kitajima et al., 2020).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "et al.

Thus, there is a necessity to perform further studies on reduction of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a WWTP. Out of five sampling dates of this study, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in four dates (March 17, April 22, 30, and May 7) and detected only on April 14. Before March 17, the reported cumulative cases of COVID-19 in Yamanashi Prefecture was only 2. As of April 14, when SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the current study, 36 cumulative cases had been reported, corresponding to 4.4 cumulative cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The curve of cumulative cases started to rise after March 30. The highest daily new reported cases (5 cases/day) were recorded on April 7 and 11 after which the daily new cases reduced noticeably. The curve of cumulative COVID-19 cases started to flatten after April 16.
