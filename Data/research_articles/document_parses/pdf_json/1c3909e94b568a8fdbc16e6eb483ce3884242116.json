In addition to those arising in the areas of religious toleration, judicial practice, treatment of labor and forced abortion, which were extensively reported by the media in the past, some newly emerged problems concerning human rights violation are much more alarming, due to the size of population affected and the degree of challenge caused to the public's psychological endurance and confidence in the social ethnics and administration of the nation. Most of all, these problems concern nearly every Chinese citizen's wellbeing and impact on their personal prosperity, as well as the prosperity of the nation as a whole. These problems are mainly associated with failures in environmental protection, food safety, and medical security.",

This course has been accelerated since the 1990s with an average urban population growth rate of more than 3.4%. 10 Nowadays, the number of urban population has reached 7711.6 million, account for 56.1% of the total population of the nation. 11 In the meantime, China has scored an extraordinary GDP growth rate ranging from the lowest 6.8% to the highest 13% between 1991 and 2014. 12 If these are to be seen as modernization or development, the modernization or development droughts and storms, deforestation, desertification, etc., affected more than two billion people and the economic toll multiplied compared with the previous decades. 17 This trend has an even acuter presentation in China. In the past three decades, China experienced extraordinary economic growth, accompanied by rapid industrialization and urbanization. The emergence of many city clusters has resulted in centralized and condensed population in urban areas. The economic development, together with urbanization, has generated substantial environmental problems. Nowadays, China is facing nearly all of the world's ecological challenges including climate change, desertification, deforestation, declining water resources, acid rain, soil erosion, air and water pollution and biodiversity loss. 18 Apart from increasingly frequent natural disasters caused by climate change, air and water pollution has become a paramount concern to the general public, which is acutely perceived in their daily life. As mentioned in the beginning of this section, the cost of environmental degradation in China is massive and profound, from people's lifespan to economic toll.",

Good environment is a pre-requisite for the enjoyment of fundamental human rights. 19 In China, for a long time, human rights violations and environmental degradation have not been treated by central and local governments as related issues and addressed in a coherent and integrated way. It has become evident that environmental protection and human rights are prima facie interrelated, interconnected, and mutually responsive, since they both serve the purpose of improving and sustaining the well-being of humanity. 20 Human well-being has a basic requirement for safe food, clean air and drinking water, safe shelter and protection from diseases. 21 Human activities such as rapid industrialization and urbanization result in environmental degradation 17 including rising of sea levels, air and water pollution, drought, flooding, which in turn, affects people at a large number. At the international law level, the vital role that environment plays in guaranteeing individuals' fundamental human rights has been recognized at a much earlier time. The Stockholm Declaration of 1972, Nairobi Declaration of 1982, World Charter for Nature of 1980, Earth Summit of 1992, Johannesburg Conference on Sustainable Development of 2002, UN Conference on Sustainable Development of 2012 have all acknowledged the interdependence between environment and human rights by conveying the message that environment may lead to long term impact on humanity and violation of human rights. 22 The Human Rights Council in its resolution 7/23 of March 2008 and resolution 10/4 of March 2009 focused specifically on human rights and climate change, pointing out that environment change impairs and undermines directly and indirectly the effective enjoyment of human rights. 23 Traditional international environmental laws commonly address environmental issues through creating and determining rights and obligations between states. Human rights laws, on the other hand, place individuals' rights at the center of the focus. The establishment of the linkage between human rights and environment enables individuals victimized by environmental degradation to seek remedy on human rights violation ground, which traditional environmental laws gives little focus.",

In his keynote report in the opening ceremony, Hu Jin Tao, the President of China by then, emphasized the term \"ecological civilization\" for fifteen times. His successor, the current president Xi Jin Ping, in his speeches at the National People's Congress 2015 and at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 2015, called for environment protection and pointed out that protecting environment is as important as protecting productive forces. 24 With the initiative from top leaders, the governments of all levels have become more and more mobilized to change their focus and give particular importance to environment protection. Although the areas like Beijing, Hebei and Shanxi are still frequently blanketed by hazardous smog and problems caused by environmental degradation and climate change are still acute, people are more willingly to adopt an optimistic attitude when speaking likely environmental improvement in the coming decades.",

In today's China, eating occupies nearly all occasions and businesses. Visitors to China are likely to find that eating is arranged as a highlight for them by the hosts. Some research suggests that the current food consumption pattern in China even poses as an exception to Engel's Law, that is: as the income of an average Chinese family rises, the proportion of income spent on food increases, rather than decreases. 25 Some other research finds that in fact, the share of Chinese households' income spent on food fell from over half in the 1970s to about one-third nowadays. 26 Nevertheless, one-third of household income being spent on food is still spectacularly excessive, compared with 6.7% in the U.S., 9.3% in the U.K., and 6.7% in Singapore. 27 While all levels of the population take any possible opportunities to indulge with feasts, disturbing facts concerning food safety emerge. This article concerns itself with some of the most severe problems associated with food safety in China, which mainly refer to the cases involving deliberate contamination of food for profits. These include problems such as manufacturing and trading imitation food (e.g., selling pork as beef), processing and selling contaminated food, adding chemical additives into food products for improving visual appeal, taste, or simply for falsely 24 increasing nutritional value (e.g., adding melamine into baby formula to inflate the protein levels), and producing and trading tainted food (e.g., profiting from recycled oil mainly dredged up from restaurant gutters). 28 Worst of all, the above problems are not sporadic but are widespread and rampant, and in some cases, systematic. It needs to be borne in mind that the above issues are the most severe ones and only account for a small part of the avalanche of food scandals. Here, incidents relating to sanitation or foodborne illness outbreaks caused by negligence in manufacture and service processes are not taken into account, though they are also serious problems.",

It is high time for the Chinese to review their policies and strategies in dealing with social issues, including social justice, equal distribution, anticorruption and clean governments, social ethics and public morality, and public psychology. Regulation is surely a necessary instrument to control illegal conduct.

Research has shown that the managerial costs in Chinese firms are chiefly caused by defects inherent in the governance of these firms. 35 Without fundamental improvements in the corporate governance system, 30 34 Xu, supra note 32. 35 See, for detailed discussions on managerial costs and corporate governance in Chinese firms, Yuwa Wei, \"Directors' Duties under Chinese Law -A Comparative Review\", 3(1) University of the costs are likely to continue to inflate.

            "text": "It took the government 8 years to realize that giving enterprises free rein in regards to food quality control was an unwise decision. It was at least partly responsible for the current culpable culture in the food industry. In the aftermath of a series of food scandals, policy and regulatory mechanisms have been introduced as the main crisis control efforts. On The current law imposes full responsibility on food producers and manufacturers to ensure that their products meet safety standards throughout each process, including purchase of raw materials, production, storage, package, transport and delivery. 37 In addition, they need to faithfully record the safety management throughout the whole course. However, China's experiences reveal that without fierce scrutiny, the industry is unlikely to comply with such requirements. Under the current regime, the supervision and administration are given to local governments at or above the county level, who formulate annual plans for food safety and undertake food sampling inspection. 38 Specific branches of government, including the departments of agriculture administration, quality supervision, industrial and commerce administration, and the food and drug administration carry out the routine work of food sampling inspection. 39 (2006) China, \u00a7 3 (2009) , an English version is available at <www.fdi.gov.cn/1800000121_39_4037_0_7.html>. The section states: \"The food producers and traders shall, in accordance with laws, regulations and food safety standards, carry out productive and operational activities, establish and improve the food safety management system and adopt efficient management measures to ensure food safety. The food producers and traders shall be responsible for the safety of produced and trade food themselves as well as society and the public, and also bear social responsibility.\" 38 Ibid, at \u00a7 47. 39 Ibid, at \u00a7 48. Persons with direct responsibility in the above mentioned governments are subject to disciplinary punishment comprising of the recording of serious demerits, demotion, dismissal or expulsion, in the event of a failure to perform their supervisory and administrative duties, particularly where the failure causes a serious social effect. 40 The same penalties are imposed directly on persons responsible for the above mentioned government branches, in the case where negligence is committed, daily supervision and inspection of food samples are omitted, abuse of power occurs, or favouritism is shown in the supervisory and administrative processes. 41 From the above overview of the new regulatory regime, a few inadequacies can be identified. First, the legal (regulatory) framework is far from comprehensive. The supervisory model of food safety mapped out in the new laws can be summarized as: relying mainly on the segment-based approach, supplemented by a categorybased approach. 42 In other words, the administration of food quality is undertaken by multiple inspection and administrative agencies, exercising their authorities in different stages of food production and services and targeting different types of foods. 43 Such an arrangement poses a potential risk in regards to conflict of powers, though the new laws allude to the benefits of efficient coordination among these agencies by identifying their authorities and duties in different stages of production and services. 44 Given the gaps in the existing laws, it is very likely that China will encounter further challenges in food supervision caused by its inefficient administrative system. Speaking from a broader perspective, China is not the only country that has applied a multi-agency approach to food supervision and administration. The United States and Japan have also adopted a scheme of assigning duties of food administration to multiple governmental agencies and departments. 45 However, their comprehensive and detailed stipulations on division of responsibilities, quality standards, transparency and public scrutiny have ensured effectiveness of the system and smooth coordination among the agencies. Moreover, it is noteworthy that even in countries such as the United States, there are increasing calls for combining their multiple agencies into a single agency to further the operational efficiency. 46 It is therefore necessary for China to improve its food safety administration system to further enhance its regulatory regime on the one hand, and to rationalize the administrative chains and procedures in food supervision on the other.",

Among government staff of relevant departments, only those directly responsible for administrative negligence or abuse of powers that result in serious social impact may face disciplinary action. 50 Criminal penalties imposed on food producers for breaches of the law are also weak. Moreover, no single criminal penalty is available to penalize delinquent public servants. The Criminal Law of China only punishes the conduct of producing 45 For instance, in the U.S., the powers of food administration are divided amongst the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. 46 See Chamus Burnside-Savazzini, \"Training in an Integrated Food Safety System: Focus on Food Protection Officials\", Food Safety Magazine (April/May 2011), <www.foodsafetymagazine.com/ article.asp?id=4018&sub=sub1>. 47 The People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, supra note 36, \u00a7 96. 48 The Food Safety Law does not address the issue of burden of proof. Hence, the rules of general law apply, rendering that the burden of proof lies upon he who brings the claim. 49 See Tonghai Liu, \"On the Shortcomings of the Foot Safety Law and Some Suggestions on Improvement\", Blog of Tonghai Liu on Legal Study Net (October 10, 2011), <http://wq.zfwlxt.com/ newLawyerSite/BlogShow.aspx?itemTypeID=fdf950ea-312b-4519-91ea-9bfb01037315&itemID= de914f78-54bd-4f50-9bdc-9f80015e3473&user=9947>. 50 The People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, supra note 36, \u00a7 61. and selling foods causing serious food poisoning and diseases, and the conduct of producing and selling foods mixed with toxic or harmful non-food substances. 51 It can thus be observed that the scope of application of the criminal law provisions is limited to offences occurring in food production and sale. This leaves the conduct of processing, packaging, storing and transporting defective or harmful foods unpunished. 52 Furthermore, the amounts of the penal fines provided in the Criminal Law are even less than those stipulated in the Food Safety Law, and are subject to a higher threshold in application. 53 Finally, the most essential issue to be addressed by the Chinese is the enforcement of the laws. According to a survey carried out by the National Survey Research Center at Renmin University of China in 2011, 68% of people interviewed attributed the cause of food scandals to administrative inefficiency and supervisory failure. 54 In the meantime, judicial failure to rigorously implement food laws has cast a further shadow over effective law enforcement in the future. It is reported that courts are reluctant to support consumers' claims for damages up to 2 or 10 times the amount of the commodity price provided for in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests 1993 and the Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China 2009. 55 Many manufacturers also promise 51 The Criminal Code of China states: \"Whoever produces or sells food that does not confirm to hygiene standards in a manner that is sufficient to cause a serious food-poisoning accident or any serious disease caused by foodborne bacteria shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than 3 years or criminal detention, and concurrently or independently be sentenced to a fine of not less than half of the sum obtained through sale and not more than twice of that. If the offence causes serious harm to human health, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 3 years and not more than 7 years, and concurrently be sentenced to a fine of not less half of the sum obtained through sale and not more than twice of that. If the consequences are especially serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less 7 years or life imprisonment, and concurrently be sentenced to a fine of not less than half of the sum obtained through sale and not more than twice of that or confiscation of property.\" A person who knowingly mixes the food to be produced or sold with toxic and harmful non-food stuffs is subject to the same penalties. : \"When any manufacturer produces any food not conforming to the food safety standards or sells any food knowing its nonconformity with the food safety standards, the customer can demand the manufacturer or the seller to pay a penalty 10 times of the paid amount, in addition to the compensation for the loss thereof.\" The amount of the compensation provided for in Article 49 of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests 1993 is up to two times upon occurrence of fraud. Junhai Liu, the Deputy President of China Consumer Association pointed out that due to judges' misunderstanding of legal reasoning, consumers' that an amount of compensation of up to 10 times the amount of the commodity price will be paid to consumers upon violation of food safety. However, such claims are likely to be rejected by courts. Some judges insist that such an amount appears to be punitive and thus does not have legal basis in contractual relations. The stance of courts in such cases renewed the public's suspicion of judicial corruption. The worst scenario concerns events involving arrest and conviction of consumer advocates. The Zhao Lianhai case is a typical example. Zhao Lianhai was a man who became an activist after his son experienced kidney problems linked to contaminated baby formula. He was convicted of inciting public disorder by setting up a web site to help other parents with sick children share information, seek compensation, and organize protests. 56 It is clear that despite legislative efforts, tackling the food safety problem is an overwhelming challenge. Compared to assessing legislative improvements, evaluating law enforcement in China presents a far more demanding task and is entangled with a number of social, political, economic and cultural issues. More discussions on enforcing food safety law in China will be carried out in Section III of this article.",

For promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals, governments are obliged to act in certain ways or to refrain from specific acts. 58 The most common universal human rights claims for compensation provided in the above provisions are rarely supported by courts in the past. See Social and Cultural Rights 1966 , the right to food is recognized as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. 63 The Rome Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action 1996 reaffirms everyone's right to \"have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger\" and describes food security as: \"[W]hen all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\" 64 It is therefore clear that as a part of human rights, the right to food is inalienable and indivisible from other fundamental rights including the right to life, the right to health, the right to know, 65 (13-17 Nov. 1996, Rome) . 65 Here, \"right to know\" is a term used in environmental law, referring to the legal principle that the individual has the right to know the chemicals to which they may be exposed in their daily living. It comprises two aspects -Community Right to Know (environmental hazard information) and Workplace Right to Know (workplace hazard information). Nowadays, the term is used in the field of human rights in reference to the right of access to information concerning citizens' human rights, or their rights under freedom of information laws. For instance see Sandra Coliver, The justifiable to say that the right to food incorporates at least the following dimensions: availability, accessibility and adequacy. 66 In other words, food must not only be available as a resource and affordable in order for people to be able to satisfy their dietary needs, but must also be safe for human consumption and free from contaminants. Everyone must have access to food that is not only nutritionally adequate, but also free from harmful substances, so that it does not endanger people's lives or health.",

The government should help those who do not already enjoy the right to food by creating opportunities for them to provide for themselves. In the case where people are unable to enjoy the right to food due to events out of the individuals' control (natural disaster for example), the government ought to provide food to them directly. 69 China is a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a contracting party of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 1979 and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989.

After decades of effort, China has mostly solved the problem of feeding its people. 71 However, new problems associated with agriculture and food have arisen since the commencement of market oriented reforms. It is reported that due to accelerated industrialization and urbanization, arable land has been shrinking and farmland capacity has declined. 72 This constitutes a threat to China's future food security. The government has introduced the National Land Consolidation Plan (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) that aims to increase the effective area of arable land by 1.6 million hectares before 2015, though the enforcement of the Plan faces challenges such as lack of mechanisms for protection of cultivated land and inefficiencies in the management of land tenure rights.",

Food availability and accessibility have been a top agenda item for the government in the past and will continue to remain a central issue in the future. The adequacy aspect received far less attention. The recent outbreak of food scandals is chiefly a result of a lack of oversight within the food industry. This can be partly attributed to the understaffing of supervisory authorities, partly to the misfeasance, malfeasance, nonfeasance and unprofessionalism of administrative officers. It is noteworthy that administrative personnel's unsupportive attitude and behavior towards businesses has been the cause of changes in inspective practice, resulting in a switch of models from official inspection to enterprise self-inspection. 73 Under the enterprise self-inspection regime, the working manner of administration is even more unprofessional. For instance, in the recycled buns case, when doing their sample inspection, the governmental inspectors, once arriving at a food factory or workshop, would only come into the administrative office and wait for the factory managerial staff to provide the samples to be examined. It is no surprise that they did not get any clues over the years. 74 In one of the clenbuterol contaminated pork 71 S Z Gu and Y J Zhang, \"Food Security in China\", in Sun Honglie and Shidong Zhao (eds.), Area Studies -China: Regional Sustainable Development Review (Vol. 1, 2009) incidents, the problematic pigs were sold from Henan pig farms to Jiangsu Province and had to go through several checkpoints conducted by the trade bureau, health inspection station, veterinary station, etc. However, some inspectors acted as middlemen between pig sellers and slaughterhouses for a commission of RMB10 Yuan per pig, which caused wide dissemination of the contaminated pork and pork products. 75 The recycled buns case showed workers in a filthy workshop \"recycling\" buns by throwing the stale buns into a vat, adding water and flour, and repackaging them to be sold anew. The clenbuterol contaminated pork case involves pig farmers feeding pigs with pig feed mixed with clenbuterol used to make the pigs have leaner bodies, which sell for a higher price. Other food scandals involve melamine-contaminated baby milk; pork sold as beef after it was soaked in borax; rice contaminated with cadmium, arsenic-laced soy sauce; popcorn and mushrooms treated with fluorescent bleach; bean sprouts tainted with an animal antibiotic; and wine diluted with sugared water and chemicals. 76 The alarming fact is that most of the food related offences were first discovered and disclosed by journalists, and not the personnel in charge of the surveillance authorities, or even the police or national security authority. It is inexcusable for administrative agencies to claim that ill-training, poor quality equipment and understaffing are the main causes for such an appalling incidence of food scandals in the country, since journalists are by no means in a position to be better trained and better equipped than food inspection agencies or police. As a matter of fact, detection and disclosure of food safety problems is not the expertise of journalists, nor their major business.",

The primary duty of the food safety inspection service is to inspect food manufacturing, processing and handling facilities, importing/exporting of foods and the monitoring of a company's facilities for compliance with the national legal and regulatory requirements. 94 In some countries, the food inspectorate also conducts the functions of investigating food poisoning and injury cases and fraudulent marketing practices, as well as handling consumer complaints. 95 of individual inspectors and the quality of their work. It is thus important to make sure that inspectors have detailed guidance and rules to follow when discharging their responsibilities.

Inspectors should receive up-to-date training in the new technologies used in processing and manufacturing, including what is required for the control of these technologies in order for them to function at maximum effectiveness and to assure proper performance. They must also be able to evaluate the performance of equipment and instruments used in production to guarantee that they are appropriately controlled and monitored. 96 The impotence of China's food safety inspectorate has been widely reported and acutely recognized by consumers. It is officially perceived that the food safety inspection administration suffers from insufficient resources, a lack of qualified personnel, and deficient coordination among layers of governments and among various institutions, particularly among those administrative agencies at the provincial level and below. 97 Apart from the above-mentioned vices, three more factors must be taken into account: corruption, shirking and laziness. China's public services have long suffered from a number of bureaucratic problems such as authoritarianism, routinism, elitism, corruption, shirking of responsibility, deceit, laziness, formalism, red tape, nepotism, seeking special privilege, overstaffing, duplication, ineffectiveness, and over-centralization. 98 Upon close study, one can discern that corruption, shirking and laziness are the most prominent problems that induce or exacerbate the other problems.

The law allowed the largest segment of workers to benefit from access to public health care through insurance funds. In the event of accidental injury, illness or old age, workers were entitled for minimum indemnity for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks. This initial system was financed by workers and employers, with the employers contributed one third, while the workers contributed two thirds to insurance funds. In 1884 Germany passed the Accident Insurance Act covering serious and fatal accidents occurring on the job in certain industries. The 1884 Act went a step further by placing the entire cost of the liability on the employers. The significance of the German health insurance program introduced in the 1880s lay in that it was for the first time in history that a national health insurance system was institutionalized. 112 Following the German practice, industrialized countries commonly introduced social security programs in the following decades, i.g., the UK 111 114 The medical insurance program as an indispensable part of the modern social security system has carried human societies into a new era where the government of a country provides economic assistance to persons faced with unemployment, disability, or agedness for the purpose of advancing the benefits of the members of the community as a whole. 115 The key feature of the scheme is: it is imposed and controlled by the government. Before the introduction of social security schemes, the dominant mode of support for people unable to provide for themselves was charitable relief proffered by benevolent societies, sometimes with financial help from the authorities.",

As a result, China's health care program has experienced a change from a scheme performing universal social welfare function to a model that is a mixture of free market and medical insurance.

By the 1980s, the administrative and financial support for the health care was removed from the national agenda through decentralization before a nationwide health insurance system was provided. 125 With local governments having little incentive to promote local healthcare, individuals of rural areas and urban non-salaried residents primarily relied on out-of-pocket spending for medical and health services. In the meantime, prices for provision of medicines, diagnostic tests, surgical implants, and specialized care were deregulated. As a direct impact, many Chinese were in short of medical services and supplies since they simply resolved to not seeking medical help. It was reported in 2003, about 50% of the Chinese people refused to see a doctor when ill and 30% of those refused to go to hospital, mainly out of financial concerns. 126 There was still worse to come. After the collapse of the previous model, no strategy was adopted to mitigate the lack of integration and coordination in the later medical system. Due to a lack of reliable local clinics, people had to wait in long queues for basic health care, with no scheduled appointments and little privacy. After all the inconvenience, what they could receive was usual a very brief face to face consultation of a few sentences or a couple of minutes. 127 During this period, health care was seen \"as a consumption activity rather than a fundamental right of the people or a responsibility of the state\". 128 Indeed, this unsustainable, reactionary approach had to be subject to review and amendment. 129 As a result, in 2003, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) for rural population, mainly funded by the government, was launched. 130 Since 2007, a health insurance scheme for urban non-salaried residents, especially for children and old people has been implemented. 131 Although China's health care system has appeared to get back on the track of government subsidy since the mid-2000, it is far from offering accessible, affordable, equitable and quality health care services with a universal coverage. Some believe that the current health care reform is unlikely to solve the fundamental problems of accessibility, affordability, equity and quality. As long as the buck-passing polity does not fully change and the health policy process is still influenced by interested groups, the problem of dis-125 See Jason Shafrin, \"An Olympic Post: The History of the Chinese Healthcare System\", Healthcare Economist (August, 2008), available at <http://healthcare-economist.com/2008/08/ page/3/>. 126 parity inherent in China's health care system will continue to affect the country's social environment. 132 The worst part of China's health care system is the rampant medical corruption stemming from the medical reform over the past decades, particularly in the period between the mid-1980s and the mid-2000s. The usual scenario is that doctors and other staff expect to be paid extra fees (usually in the form of \"red envelops\" 133 ) to perform operations and take kickbacks from pharmaceutical firms and medicalequipment suppliers. The practice is so prevalent that an unsullied doctor nearly does not exist. 134 Almost all practitioners and medical staff tell the same story as the defence of their unclean hands -low salary or underpayment. Whistle blowers also tell that doctors have economic income targets allocated by hospitals and hospital administrators for them to meet and exceed. Only upon completion of their quotes, they are paid benefit bonuses which can be much higher than their basic salaries. 135 In other words, they are under pressure to charge patients extra fees and to recommend patients to go through unnecessary but expensive tests and procedures as well as purchase expensive medicines.",

China is a contracting party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). It is thus under treaty obligation to protect individuals against corrupt acts of third parties. Though corruption and abuse of the health care scheme committed by practitioners and professionals in hospitals, insurance companies and suppliers of medical and health care goods and services impact on patients' human rights, the guilty individuals are not in direct breach of the UNCAC. Instead, the UNCAC is directed primarily at Member States rather than non-state actors. Hence, it is the obligation of the Chinese government to prevent corruption involving governments, industries, companies and individuals in fight against corruption and to raise public awareness of the matter. 139",

Some professions including teachers, doctors, lawyers and those safeguarding consumptive goods are not only important to people's lifestyle and well-being and society's progress, but also play a social role in which trustworthiness is an expectation in every tradition. 140 In China, these professions, because of the rampage of the unethical performance conducted by a majority of the people in the trades, have definitely failed to honor their part of social compact with society, which in turn exacerbates human rights related problems. It is a high time for China to review the ethical conduct of these key professions. The Chinese government has an obligation to protect citizens' human rights to health, access to healthy food, safe drinking water, clean air, and a healthy environment. In discharging this obligation, effective mechanisms combating corruption in various forms need to be established in order to sustain the country's social stability and economic prosperity.",
