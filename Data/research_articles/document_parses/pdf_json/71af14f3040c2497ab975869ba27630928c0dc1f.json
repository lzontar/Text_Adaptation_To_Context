At least 10 litters from each farm were investigated. I. suis was present on 83% of the farms and 42.5% of the litters, the infection rate being highest in the third week of age (48.2%). I. suis was found more frequently in samples of diarrhoea than in firm faeces (49.2% compared to 22.2%). Twenty naturally infected piglets from six of these farms underwent examination post mortem, including histology, virology and bacteriology. Histological examination revealed atrophy of the villi in various degrees, mild crypt hyperplasia, fusion of the villi, metaplastic epithelium, erosions and necrosis, especially in the medium and the posterior jejunum and in the ileum. Asexual and sexual developmental stages of the parasite were found in varying numbers in the epithelium of the whole of the small intestine.

However, these coccidia are often neglected as a primary pathogen since clinical findings are not specific and detection of oocysts can be difficult and is rarely attempted. Piglets with isosporosis develop diarrhoea of varying consistency, mostly at 7 to 15 days of age; overall depression and dehydration can occur. In particular, reduced weight gain and overall poor performance of infected animals are of economic importance, while death occurs only rarely (Sangster et al., 1978; Stuart et al., 1980; Sanford and Josephson, 1981; Lindsay, 1989; Driesen et al., 1993) .

On some farms piglet diarrhoea was a health problem, while on others it occurred only sporadically. On each farm at least 10 litters, preferably those with diarrhoea, were examined between 5 and 28 days of age. Individual faecal samples were taken mostly rectally, from three to five piglets of each litter and pooled. For coproscopy a combined sedimentation-flotation method was used. Two to three grams of faeces were suspended in tap water and sieved (mesh size: 250 lm) into a 100-ml glass beaker. After 3 minutes of sedimentation the supernatant was discarded, and the sediment was transferred to a 10-ml tube and centrifuged (400 \u00b7 g, 5 min). The supernatant was discarded again and the sediment was resuspended in sodium chloride/zinc chloride solution (specific gravity: 1.53 g/ml; Takla, 1985) with subsequent centrifugation as above. The tube was then filled with salt solution up to a convex meniscus. After 10 min of flotation the meniscus was lifted with a microscopical slide and examined microscopically (100 \u00b7 magnification).

For histology samples were taken from the following locations: duodenum (pars descendens duodeni), cranial, medial and caudal jejunum, ileum, caecum (caudal third) and colon (flexura centralis). Samples were fixed in 10% buffered formaline, embedded in paraffin, cut (3 lm thickness) and stained with haematoxilin-eosin (HE). Coccidia stages were counted in 10 fields (400 \u00b7 magnification) and assigned to the developmental (sexual or asexual) stages. Microbiological examination was performed by direct cultivation on blood agar with subsequent subcultivation on MacConkey agar and finally further differentiation on endoagar. Salmonella were enriched in Preu\u00df liquid medium, and material was also transferred to liver bouillon to test for clostridia.

(1996) and Meyer et al. (1999) the results of the present study show that in Germany I. suis is widely distributed amongst young suckling piglets and that infection is associated with diarrhoea. In other studies, coccidia were also found in 60-80% of the farms investigated (Driesen et al., 1993; Eysker et al., 1994; Ilieff, 1997) . The average litter infection rate lies in the range of those (36.3%) found in the Netherlands by Eysker et al. (1994) . Higher (cumulative) infection rates of 53.8-62.2% were found when litters were examined several times in weekly intervals (Eysker et al., 1994; Otten et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 1999) . We found that the highest rates of infection of the litters was in the third week of age, which is in concordance with Otten et al. (1996) . In contrast, Meyer et al. (1999) found that in large piglet production units with good management the prevalence increased until the fourth week, which Daugschies et al. (1999) put down to slower spread of the infection on farms with good hygiene management. According to Lindsay et al. (1992) and Otten et al. (1996) isosporosis can occur on any farm, independently of the size or management. However, we found that I. suis was regularly found in small to medium-sized units and on farms with straw bedding. Additionally, the prevalence was negatively correlated with the percentage of perforated floor areas, perhaps due to less contact between the piglets and their faeces, which is in concordance with the results of other authors (Sayd and Kawazone, 1996; Meyer et al., 1999) . Sangster et al. (1978) speculated that isosporosis is more common in units with straw bedding due to a poor hygienic status. Meyer et al. (1999) , however, frequently found the parasite also in large, well-managed piglet production units, while above-average hygiene measures in a nucleus herd were associated with low infection rates. Contaminated farrowing units are probably the most important source of infection of the piglets (Lindsay, 1989) , and consequently hygiene is of utmost importance to lower the infection pressure; however, even after thorough cleaning and disinfection few oocysts can remain which are sufficient for the spread of infection (Christensen and Henriksen, 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 20, "end": 39, "text": "Otten et al.

Histological lesions were found mainly in the medial and caudal jejunum and in the ileum, and in these sections parasite stages in the epithelium were most common. We therefore recommend that several tissue samples be removed from these areas of the small intestines. The microscopic alterations of the intestinal mucosa were also described by other authors for piglets with natural (Eustis and Nelson, 1981; Vitovec and Koudela, 1987) or experimental (Matuschka and Heydorn, 1980) isosporosis. In cases of field infections more asexual than sexual stages were found in the epithelium (Sanford and Josephson, 1981; Chae et al., 1998) , which is in agreement with our findings. Piglets infected primarily with asexual stages at necropsy displayed the most prominent pathohistological changes of the intestinal mucosa, as described by Stuart et al. (1980) and Robinson et al.

The position of the endogenous stages in the epithelium was identical to previous observations Matuschka and Heydorn, 1980; Harleman and Meyer, 1984) ; occasionally the large intestines are affected without significant histological alterations (Sangster et al., 1978; Sanford and Josephson, 1981; Harleman and Meyer, 1984) .

Since in cases of field infections time and dose of infection are unknown, we could not correlate the pathohistological changes to the infection rate of the epithelium. However, it could be demonstrated that infection of the intestinal epithelium with coccidia is unambiguously correlated with pathohistological changes of varying degrees.

C. perfringens type A can lead to mild villous atrophy, but it can also be found in the faeces of healthy animals (Waldmann and Plonait, 1997) . C. perfringens type A was found in five out of 10 animals examined. A synergistic effect of these bacteria with I. suis, as described by Nabuurs et al. (1983) for rotaviruses, cannot be excluded and requires further investigations. E. coli was found in 12 animals. Enterotoxic E. coli (ETEC) are amongst the most important causes for diarrhoea in suckling piglets and weaners; however, the cause for diarrhoea is hypersecretion with little or no mucosal lesions of the mucosa (Waldmann and Plonait, 1997) . Only three of the 12 E. coli isolates were haemolytic and have to be considered as pathogenic for piglets. In previous works ETEC were also only rarely found in Isospora-infected piglets (Ilieff, 1997; Chae et al., 1998) . The rare occurrence of pathogenic E. coli in our study is probably due to vaccination of the sows.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 198, "text": "(Waldmann and Plonait, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 338, "end": 359, "text": "Nabuurs et al.

We only found necrotic enteritis in one case of isosporosis with concurrent infection with C. perfringens type A. It can be assumed that secondary pathogens can exacerbate an Isospora infection, and that the infection rate of the epithelium with parasite stages causing primary damage plays a crucial role for the course of the disease. Competing infectious agents make diagnosis more difficult and may be misinterpreted as primary causes of diarrhoea (Greve, 1985; Lindsay et al., 1992) , so that a complete diagnosis even after isolation of one enteropathogen is important (Chae et al., 1998) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 6, "end": 27, "text": "Driesen et al.
