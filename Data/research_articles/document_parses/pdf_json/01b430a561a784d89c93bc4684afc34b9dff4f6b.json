            "text": "Justification: During the current rapidly evolving pandemic of COVID-19 infection, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their newborn infants form a special vulnerable group that needs immediate attention. Unlike other elective medical and surgical problems for which care can be deferred during the pandemic, pregnancies and childbirths continue. Perinatal period poses unique challenges and care of the mother-baby dyads requires special resources for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. Process: The GRADE approach recommended by the World Health Organization was used to develop the guideline. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) comprising of obstetricians, neonatologists and pediatricians was constituted. The GDG drafted a list of questions which are likely to be faced by clinicians involved in obstetric and neonatal care. An e-survey was carried out amongst a wider group of clinicians to invite more questions and prioritize. Literature search was carried out in PubMed and websites of relevant international and national professional organizations. Existing guidelines, systematic reviews, clinical trials, narrative reviews and other descriptive reports were reviewed. For the practice questions, the evidence was extracted into evidence profiles. The context, resources required, values and preferences were considered for developing the recommendations. Objectives: To provide recommendations for prevention of transmission, diagnosis of infection and providing clinical care during labor, resuscitation and postnatal period. Recommendations: A set of twenty recommendations are provided under the following broad headings: 1) pregnant women with travel history, clinical suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 infection; 2) neonatal care; 3) prevention and infection control; 4) diagnosis; 5) general questions.",

            "text": "The disease spreads by droplets generated by infected people during sneezing and coughing. These are large droplets that travel for 1-2 m and settle on surfaces on which the virus can remain alive for hours to days [5] . Infected persons can also spread the infection even before C oronaviruses are RNA viruses with glycoprotein spikes that give them a crown like appearance [1, 2] . Four species have been in circulation for a long time and cause mild respiratory disease. They have a lot of genetic diversity and have jumped the species barrier leading to severe respiratory disease ( the onset of symptoms. Infection is acquired by either inhalation of infected droplets or touching surfaces/ fomites contaminated with the infected droplets and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth. Incubation period varies from 2-14 days with a median of 5 days. The average number of people infected by one infected individual is between two to three. The clinical symptoms are variable, ranging from asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction. In adults, common symptoms include fever, cough, breathlessness, fatigue, myalgia, headache and sore throat, while vomiting, diarrhea, sneezing and conjunctivitis are uncommon. Current evidence suggests that 80-85% of cases are mild, 10-15 % are severe with lower respiratory tract involvement, and 5% are critical, needing ICU care. The fatality rate is reportedly between 2-3% but can vary from 0.5-10% depending on the number tested, the percentage of elderly people in the population and availability of critical care support in the hospitals. The severity and fatality are higher in the elderly, especially above the age of 60 (among those aged more than 80 years, fatality rate was 15%), and those with comorbidities like heart disease, hypertension, diabetes etc. There is paucity of data on COVID-19 in pregnancy and neonates. Available data suggests that in general the outcome among pregnant women and neonates is good. A large proportion of infected pregnant women are likely to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms [6] . However, severe disease needing admission to intensive care unit has been reported among pregnant women. Emerging evidence indicates that among women infected with COVID-19 in the third trimester, the risk of vertical transmission is low. Reported clinical features of COVID-19 infection in neonates include fever, lethargy, cough, vomiting and respiratory distress, thus mimicking the presentation of bacterial sepsis [2, 7, 8] .",

One died due to severe disease. No clinical trials have compared specific care including isolation strategies in pregnant women. Majority of women in these studies were delivered by Csection; however, in the only case-control study, all controls were also delivered by C-section. Incidence of Csection is high in China, from where all studies have originated, and it is not possible to infer that Covid-19 infection increases the probability of C-section. Literature indicates possibility of higher incidence of fetal distress in infected pregnant women. However, due to small sample size and lack of comparison group, no definite inference can be made.

Hydroxychloroquine in a dose of 600 mg (200 mg thrice a day with meals) and azithromycin (500 mg once a day) for 10 days has been shown to give virologic cure on VOLUME 57 __ JUNE 15, 2020 20.

The study included 20 treated patients with upper and lower respiratory symptoms. In this study, pregnancy was an exclusion criterion. However, as such, both these drugs have been used in pregnancy and during breastfeeding without significant effects on the mother or fetus. Alternative dosage regimens for hydroxychloroquine are to give 400 mg twice a day on day 1 and then 400 mg once a day for the next four days. Chloroquine can also be used as an alternative. The dose is 500 mg twice a day for 7 days. Some authorities recommend that azithromycin should be added only where there is a clinical suspicion of superadded bacterial infection. Lopinavir-ritonavir was the first antiviral combination used to treat COVID-19 infection. However, there was no difference in time to clinical improvement or mortality at 28 days in a randomized trial of 199 patients with severe COVID-19 given lopinavir-ritonavir (400/100 mg) twice daily for 14 days in addition to standard care versus those who received standard care alone [28] .
