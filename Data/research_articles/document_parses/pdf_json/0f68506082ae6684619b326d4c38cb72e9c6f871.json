Emerging data indicate that myocardial dysfunction can be detected presumably earlier than clinical decompensation by transthoracic echocardiography. However, use of echocardiography needs to be balanced against the risk for frontline sonographers of contracting COVID-19. A group of five American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography-certified sonographers volunteered to form a focused cardiac imaging protocol using high-end cardiac ultrasound machines (Table 1) .

It is important to obtain an RV-focused view from an elongated apical 4-chamber view (slide more laterally on the patient's chest). Obtaining this image will improve RV free wall endocardial definition, avoid foreshortening, and aid in lengthening the RV from base to apex. Additional RV parameters should include pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) as well as annular mobility (tissue Doppler imaging) for an overall comprehensive assessment of RV systolic function. In conjunction with the LV evaluation, RV longitudinal strain should be performed from the acquired RV-focused view after the sonographer leaves the patient room.
