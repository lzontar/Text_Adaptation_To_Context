However, many areas have faced diagnostic testing shortages, requiring difficult decisions to be made regarding who receives a test, without knowing the implications of those decisions on population-level transmission dynamics. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are commonly used tools to guide clinical decisions. We used data from electronic health records to develop a parsimonious 5-variable CPR to identify those who are most likely to test positive, and found that its application to prioritize testing increases the proportion of those testing positive in settings of limited testing capacity. To consider the implications of these gains in daily case detection on the population level, we incorporated testing using the CPR into a compartmentalized disease transmission model. We found that prioritized testing led to a delayed and lowered infection peak (i.e. \"flattens the curve\"), with the greatest impact at lower values of the effective reproductive number (such as with concurrent social distancing measures), and when higher proportions of infectious persons seek testing. Additionally, prioritized testing resulted in reductions in overall infections as well as hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) burden.

For example, when R e was lowered, as may happen with the introduction of other public health interventions such as social distancing, the effects of prioritized testing increased. This suggests that implementing prioritized testing concurrently with other non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduce R e , can help to maximize potential gains. Increasing the proportion of infectious people who seek testing (w I ) increases the effects of prioritized testing because of the indirect benefit (reduction of R e ) of isolating those individuals quickly.

Further, many countries and regions with lower resources may continue to have limited capacity for testing. Investment in a system of prioritized testing may be more cost-effective than the manufacturing or purchasing of more tests to meet demand.

Instead, we highlight the generalizability of the approach we have presented, and that the individual and population level impacts of prioritized testing are robust to the specific CPR used (Table S2) . Secondly, our model assumes that all individuals seeking testing would present at the same time.

Daily estimates of R t for Utah were obtained for April 20 through May 20, 2020 (36). The average R t value was 1.08, with no significant increase over that time (linear regression; t = -1.53, p > 0.1), suggesting that prevalence was approximately constant over that period. Using data from coronavirus.utah.gov (21) , the mean total daily testing number over this period was 4207 tests with an average of 181 new positive tests each day. To consider the corresponding daily deaths resulting from cases over this period, we assumed a lag of 11 days (37), considering the daily deaths from May 1-June 1, 2020, with data collected from the Covid Tracking Project (38). Over this period, the average number of daily deaths was 2.09. We assumed an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.5%, suggesting an average of approximately 418 new cases per day over this period. Assuming a daily recovery probability of ~1/6 (\u03b3 in the SEIR model), an infectious individual has a 5/6 probability of not recovering on a given day. Thus, at the start of a given day, the number of infected individuals is the sum of those becoming infectious that day (~418 people), plus the number who became infectious the day before and did not yet recover (~418*(5/6)), plus the number who became infectious two days before and have not yet recovered (~418*(5/6)*(5/6)), etc. This is a geometric series which converges to an estimate of 2508, o u r daily estimate of the average prevalence over this three-week period. This implies that 7.2% (181/2508) of infectious people are test eligible daily, i.e., w I = 0.072.
