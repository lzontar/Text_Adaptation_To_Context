            "text": "The COVID-19 with ARDS can mimic exacerbation of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) on imaging. The Berlin criteria can be used in differentiating ARDS and cardiac failure by assessing the timing of symptoms, bilateral opacities, volume overload, value of brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography findings [5] . Based on euvolemia, baseline cardiac markers and ejection fraction, our patient had ARDS due to COVID-19 rather than acute HFrEF. SARS CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor using spike protein, and pH, or lipid mediated endocytosis. The acidic endosomal pH activates virion, causing its release into the cytoplasm. The free virion undergoes transcription and translation to form new virions that ultimately exported out of cells in a new vesicle [6] . ACE-2 receptors are predominantly found in vascular endothelial cells and type 2 pneumocytes. SARS CoV-2 downregulates ACE-2 receptors in the cardiopulmonary system, leading to accumulation of angiotensin-II. Furthermore, increased expression of ACE-2 due to chronic RAAS activation increases COVID-19 predisposition in the setting of prior heart failure [7] . Literature review showed that angiotensin-II plays a critical role in widespread tissue injury by igniting cytokine storm consisting of more than 150 inflammatory mediators. Major inflammatory responses cause intracellular apoptosis by reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteasomal degradation, lipolysis and caspase mediated cytotoxicity driven by increased NkB levels that ultimately increases tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) [8] . The intracellular apoptosis is also enhanced by dephosphorylation of Akt, decreased atrogin 1 and phosphorylation of FOXO-1, a transcription factor that causes apoptosis of cardiac and pulmonary endothelial tissues, a probable explanation of cytotoxicity seen in the pulmonary system causing ARDS due to COVID-19 in our patient.",

RAAS inhibitors blockers can upregulate the ACE-2 receptors enhancing viral invasion [9] . Based on these recommendations, we stopped the initial regimen of valsartan-sacubitril in our patient. Some studies reported that RAAS inhibitors can limit cytotoxicity by inhibiting the angiotensin-II through indirect upregulation of ACE-2 [10] . Taking both RAAS blockers and statins into consideration, both drugs work by reducing endothelial dysfunction through decreasing ACE-2/Ang (1-7)/MAS axis and FOXO phosphorylation mediated apoptosis [11] . We reconciled the home dose statin in our patient that potentially wors- Given the patient's elevated inflammatory markers, chest radiographic findings of bilateral diffuse ground-glass (GG) infiltrates and positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19, the patient was treated for COVID-19 with non-invasive ventilation for ARDS. Gautret et al reported that azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine has shown significant viral eradication (P < 0.001) [12] . In our case, we administered a combined regimen of off-label tocilizumab single dose, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for 5 days. Despite the management directed toward COVID-19 infection, and maintaining cardiopulmonary function, our patient died of cardiopulmonary failure.",
