High frequency of recombination is believed to be contributed by the large genome size, the intrinsic templateswitching property of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during replication, and the abundance of subgenomic RNA strands for template switching (8, 9) . The role of RdRp in RNA recombination has been shown in poliovirus, where a single amino acid residue mutation in the RdRp of poliovirus can result in a decrease in RNA recombination frequency (10) .

MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels in the Middle East as well as in Africa, with the greatest virus diversity found in Africa (17) . Circulation of multiple lineages of clade B MERS-CoV in dromedary camels eventually resulted in the emergence of a recombinant lineage 5 virus that caused major outbreaks during 2015 within both Saudi Arabia and South Korea, following introduction of the virus by a returning traveler (18) . Recent studies have shown that two other coronaviruses, alphacoronavirus dromedary camel coronavirus 229E (DcCoV-229E) and beta-CoV dromedary camel coronavirus HKU23 (DcCoV-HKU23), cocirculate in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia (18, 19) . The cocirculation of at least three coronaviruses within camels provides an opportunity for the emergence of novel emerging infections via recombination. It is therefore important to look for evidence of recombination between coronaviruses cocirculating in dromedary camels because such recombination might have contributed to the emergence of MERS-CoV and might contribute to the future emergence of viruses of zoonotic and epidemic potential. Here, we report the genetic diversity of DcCoV-HKU23 in the African camel population and identify several recombination events that have taken place with clade A beta-CoVs, including recombination with bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and with more-distant species such as rabbit coronavirus (RbCoVHKU14) and rodent coronavirus (RodentCoV).

The observed diversity of DcCoV-HKU23 was comparable to that of BCoV, suggesting that the two viruses were introduced into their animal hosts at similar points in time.

Phylogenetic analysis of DcCoV-HKU23 with BCoV and HCoV-OC43 sequences. To infer the phylogenetic relationship of the newly identified African DcCoV-HKU23 strain to previously reported DcCoV-HKU23 strains from Saudi Arabia and to bovine coronaviruses which are closely related, phylogenetic trees based on the complete coding sequences of the RdRp gene (2,783 nucleotides [nt]), the spike gene (4,101 nt), and the nucleocapsid gene (1,347 nt) were constructed.

Using the genotyping nomenclature previously described for HCoV-OC43 and BCoV (23, 24) as a reference point, the sequences of DcCoV-HKU23 examined in this study were mapped into the 3 main subclusters of BCoV, namely, C1, C2, and C3, where C1 contains BCoVs from the Americas, C2 contains BCoVs from Europe, and C3 contains the prototype BCoV (Fig. 3 ).

The serological prevalence rates of DcCoV-HKU23 antibodies in camels were 92% in Nigeria, 91% in Ethiopia, and 79% in Morocco, suggesting widespread circulation of this or an antigenically related virus over a broad geographical area across Africa in a manner comparable with the circulation of MERS-CoV (29, 30). Younger camels had lower seropositive rates than adult camels in Morocco, but no age-related differences were observed in Nigeria and Ethiopia. Differences in DcCoV-HKU23 seroprevalence rates may be attributable to variations in husbandry practices, cohabitant animal hosts, or climatic factors between these countries. Similar seroprevalence rates were observed in camels in abattoirs and farms, suggesting that virus circulation had already been established at the farm or herd level and did not solely reflect amplification in the camel marketing chain. Extensive crossneutralization of DcCoV-HKU23 and BCoV was detected, with a trend to higher titers for DcCoV-HKU23. The high (92% to 97%) amino acid sequence identity of the spike proteins of DcCoV-HKU23 and BCoV very likely contributed the cross-neutralization seen between the two viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 660, "end": 664, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The full-genome sequences obtained from DcCoV-HKU23 isolates collected across Africa and Saudi Arabia allowed us to study the genetic diversity of this virus in camel populations.

The observed diversity of DcCoV-HKU23 was comparable to that of BCoV, suggesting that the two viruses have been established in their hosts for similar periods of time. It is of interest that DcCoV-HKU23 has a much higher level of diversity than MERS-CoV. At present, there are three CoVs (camel CoV 229E, DcCoV-HKU23, and MERS-CoV) cocirculating in dromedary camels; the narrower range of genetic diversity of MERS-CoV possibly indicates a more recent introduction into camels or a purifying selection event in its more recent evolutionary history.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Phylogenetic analysis of the full genomes of DcCoV-HKU23 in Africa with other published BCoV sequences available at GenBank identified incongruent topologies in the phylogenetic trees of the RdRp, S, and N genes, indicating events of recombination. With reference to the BCoV genotyping method described previously, the DcCoV-HKU23 strains obtained in this study were classified into 3 genotypes: C2/C2/C2, C2/C Outlier /C2, and C2/C Outlier /C3. The C Outlier clade has no BCoV sequences and is a uniquely DcCoV-HKU23 clade. Two DcCoV-HKU23 samples from Morocco (CAC2505 and CAC2753) showed a C2/C2/C2 genotype, which represents a nonrecombinant variant of BCoV clade 2, suggesting a BCoV evolutionary origin and the possibility that a BCoV spillover into the Moroccan camel population had taken place. This is the first time that a nonrecombinant BCoV variant has been detected in camels. Previously, BCoV was detected in a wide range of ungulate hosts, including bovines, waterbuck, sambar deer, white-tailed deer, alpaca, giraffe, stable antelope, buffalo, and yak (31) (32) (33) (34) . The expansion of BCoV to camel hosts further illustrates its ability to cross species and to infect other similar ungulate hosts. Recently, surveillance of BCoV has been expanded into regions of East Asia, including China (35), South Korea (36), and Vietnam (37) , and into the Caribbean (Cuba) (38) .

The C1 and C2 genotypes of BCoV correspond to the American-Asian and European clusters, respectively. In this study, the C2 genotype of the two Morocco strains clustered with BCoVs detected in France, suggesting a divergence from the common ancestor of genotype C2 BCoVs. Other DcCoVs identified in this study, as well as those previously identified in Saudi Arabia, are recombinants, because their S gene showed an outgroup topology with respect to BCoVs and HCoV-OC43, indicating that DcCoV-HKU23 acquired its S gene through recombination with an ancestor yet to be identified. However, we cannot infer whether the recombination occurred prior to or after the introduction of the virus to camels from the present data. The phylogenies of the N genes of DcCoV-HKU23 also differed among the 8 recombinant sequences with the C Outlier genotype in the S gene. A total of 7 DcCoV-HKU23 sequences (NV1010, NV1092, NV1097, NV1385, CAC1320, CAC1452, and CAC2586) were grouped into C3 in the N gene tree, indicating a close relatedness to the prototype BCoV in the N gene. DcCoV-HKU23/CAC1019 from Ethiopia and DcCoV-HKU23 from Saudi Arabia were grouped into the C2 European clade. These C2 genotype sequences suggest the possibility that an event of recombination between the N gene of a nonrecombinant BCoV strain and a recombinant DcCoV-HKU23 strain (as the backbone) had taken place. Overall, DcCoV-HKU23 exhibited broad diversity that contrasted with the genetic stability observed in BCoV. However, a limitation in the analysis was the lack of BCoV sequence data in Africa.

Rabbit-CoV14 is a virus initially discovered through surveillance in China (39), but similar viruses may be present in a much wider geographic region. Bootscan analysis of DcCoV-HKU23 strains from Nigeria and Ethiopia showed a recombination signal with RbCoV-HKU14-like virus at positions 22601 to 23600, harboring the NS2a and HE gene. The HE gene in clade A beta-CoVs has been suggested to have been acquired as a consequence of heterologous recombination with influenza C virus. The recombination identified here was located in a similar region, suggesting a possible recombination hot spot. The phylogeny of the signal region showed that the RbCoV sequence was linked to the DcCoV-HKU23 sequences from Ethiopia and Nigeria at a basal position, suggesting that the recombination event might have occurred with the ancestral sequence from these two regions. The HE protein encoded by clade A beta-CoVs plays a role in receptor binding through its receptor-binding or receptor-destroying activity with respect to glycan components (40) . An example of the functional properties of HE has been provided in the adaptation of HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 to infect humans, when the HE lectin domain was progressively lost through accumulated mutations (41) .

The deletion patterns of ORF4a and ORF4b observed in DcCoV-HKU23, RbCoV-HKU14, and HCoV-OC43 revealed stepwise deletions among these sequences. While these patterns may suggest a BCoV origin of these sequences, it is also possible that an ancestral virus that infected multiple hosts and bovines preferentially retained those ORFs. Nonsense mutations and deletions of these ORFs in DcCoV-HKU23, RbCoV-HKU14, and HCoV-OC43 supported the contention that this region may not contain essential genetic sequences and that the loss of such genetic information will not impair virus fitness in dromedaries. In fact, ORF4a and ORF4b in BCoV had previously been suggested to represent vestiges of an 11-kDa protein encoded by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) resulting from a nonsense mutation in the middle of ORF4 (26) . The region between the S and E genes may suggest a mouse or murine CoV origin of this region. As additional evidence, we also observed another 8.9-kDa protein encoded by ORF4a in DcCoV-HKU23 identified in this study which mapped to a similar protein in rodent CoV with 60% amino acid similarity. Bootscan analysis showed that DcCoV sequences from isolates collected in Morocco (CAC2586) and Nigeria (NV1010, NV1092, NV1097, and NV1385) were phylogenetically classified in an outgroup with rodent CoV at positions 27901 to 28800, suggesting a possible homologous recombination.
