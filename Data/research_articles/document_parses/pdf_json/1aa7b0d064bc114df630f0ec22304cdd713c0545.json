Examination revealed an ill appearance, diffuse rales bilaterally and tenderness of the left and right lower abdominal quadrants. Laboratory results included a normal white blood cell count (WBC), lymphopenia (19.5%), neutrophilia (73%), monocytosis (13%), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 87 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 53 U/L), C-reactive protein (CRP, 69 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 261 U/L), and creatine phosphokinase (131 U/L). X-ray and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral ground glass opacities (GGOs). Abdominal CT demonstrated thickening of the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon and rectum consistent with colitis ( Figure 1 ). A nasal swab was positive for COVID-19 by realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We treated him in hospital with off-label hydroxychloroquine, 400 mg b.i.d. on day 1, followed by 400 mg q.d. for 4 days, and azithromycin 500 mg q.d. and zinc sulfate 220 mg q.d. for 5 days. Patient was admitted for total of 5 days followed by clinical improvement, and then, he was discharged with instruction about 2 weeks of home quarantine.",

Patients with digestive symptoms had a longer period from symptom onset to hospital admission compared with patients without these symptoms (3, 5) , possibly due to mild symptoms or lack of awareness of gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 disease.
