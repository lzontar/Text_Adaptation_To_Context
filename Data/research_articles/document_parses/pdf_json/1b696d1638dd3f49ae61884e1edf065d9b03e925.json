Patients' perceptions of stress and their use of coping strategies may influence fatigue severity. This study extends our previous work describing distinct profiles of morning (i.e., Very Low, Low, High, and Very High) and evening (i.e., Low, Moderate, High, and Very High) fatigue in oncology patients by evaluating for differences in stress and coping strategies among these fatigue classes. Methods This longitudinal study evaluated for changes in morning and evening fatigue in oncology patients (n = 1332) over two cycles of chemotherapy (CTX). Patients completed measures of cumulative exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) (i.e., the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised), general stress (i.e., Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]), cancer-specific stress (i.e., Impact of Event Scale-Revised [IES-R]), and coping strategies (i.e., Brief Cope). Differences among the latent classes were evaluated using analyses of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, or chi-square tests. Results Patients in both the Very High morning and evening fatigue classes reported higher numbers of and a higher impact from previous SLEs and higher PSS scores than the other fatigue classes. The IES-R scores for the Very High morning fatigue class met the criterion for subsyndromal PTSD. Patients in the Very High evening fatigue class used a higher number of engagement coping strategies compared with the Very High morning fatigue class.

While previous research found associations between childhood SLEs and increased risk for greater fatigue severity in women with breast cancer [8] , our study is the first to evaluate the impact of SLEs on fatigue severity in a sample of patients with heterogeneous cancer diagnoses. Compared with the other three classes, patients in both the Very High morning and evening fatigue classes reported higher numbers of and higher impact from previous SLEs. The increased allostatic load associated with cumulative SLEs [4] is a plausible explanation for these associations. For example, higher levels of and higher impact from SLEs increased the risk of experiencing chronic pain [33] , as well as fatigue and depression [34] . These findings suggest that SLEs in oncology patients may be associated with increased risk for multiple cooccurring symptoms and warrant further study. Given that higher cumulative life stress was associated with increased allostatic load in healthy adults and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome [35] , our findings of higher PSS (3) SD, standard deviation scores in the Very High morning and evening fatigue classes, compared with the other classes, suggests that this mechanism may occur in oncology patients. Equally important, PSS scores were associated with greater fatigue severity in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and inflammatory bowel disease [36] and unexplained chronic fatigue [37] . Because these conditions and fatigue associated with cancer share inflammation as a common underlying mechanism, future studies need to examine the additive or synergistic effects of stress and inflammatory mechanisms on fatigue severity. A cancer diagnosis and its treatment(s) are significant stressors, with 20% of patients reporting cancer-related subsyndromal PTSD [1] . The IES-R total score for patients in the Very High morning fatigue class (i.e., 29.9) meets the criterion for subsyndromal PTSD [30] . This finding is consistent with previous reports of greater fatigue severity being associated with higher IES-R total scores in patients with Cushing's disease [38] and survivors of Middle East respiratory syndrome [39] . While the patients in the Very High evening fatigue class had IES-R total scores below the clinically meaningful cutoff for subsyndromal PTSD (i.e., IES-R total score of 21.7), their scores were significantly higher than those of the other three evening fatigue classes, which suggests that cancer-specific stress is a risk factor for greater evening fatigue severity. Given the negative impact of fatigue on oncology patients receiving CTX [40] , the higher scores on the avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal subscales of the IES-R are not unexpected. Our findings suggest that interventions to decrease cancer-specific stress (e.g., yoga [41] ) may decrease fatigue severity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 71, "end": 74, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 87, "end": 90, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 339, "end": 342, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 713, "end": 716, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 874, "end": 878, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 915, "end": 919, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1226, "end": 1230, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1604, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1637, "end": 1641, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2017, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2153, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2320, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2371, "end": 2375, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2819, "end": 2823, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 3020, "end": 3024, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In terms of the impact of coping strategies on fatigue, in older oncology patients (i.e., > 70 years), disengagement coping strategies were associated with higher fatigue severity [42] . In contrast, engagement coping strategies mediated fatigue's impact during [42] and after [42, 43] cancer treatment completion. In studies that explored the perceptions of effective coping strategies for fatigue in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [43] and end-stage kidney disease The coping strategies of positive reframing, acceptance, religion, and substance use are not included in the table because no significant differences were found between the highest morning and evening fatigue latent classes compared with the lowest classes (ESKD) [44] , both groups valued clinicians' acknowledgment of fatigue variability, support to deal with the impact of fatigue in their daily lives, and active participation in individualizing interventions [43, 44] . Noticeable similarities and differences were apparent in the coping strategies used by patients in the Very High morning and Very High evening fatigue classes (Table 3) . Patients in the Very High evening fatigue class identified using engagement coping strategies more frequently than patients in the Very High morning fatigue class. One possible explanation for this difference in the use of engagement coping strategies may be the impact of morning compared with evening fatigue. In healthy adults, awakening refreshed without fatigue is considered \"normal\" [45] . Therefore, a patient may not actively plan or seek support when they expect to feel less fatigued in the morning.
