In contrast to this, BMT can prevent or delay progression of the aforementioned complications. Approximately 70% of thalassemic patients lack a related matched donor. 19 For those patients who lack HLA-identical sibling donors, alternative sources of bone marrow must be sought. It is well known that thalassemia is more frequent in many developing societies where the mortality from this disease remains extremely high and few patients survive to adulthood because it is not possible to give conventional treatment due to inadequate transfusion services and cost of chelating treatment. In such circumstances an alternative BMT from a related donor may be the only salvage therapy for at least some groups of patients. In a preliminary study we reported some results of alternative BMT in patients with thalassemia. 20 In the present retrospective study we examined survival, rejection and transplant-related complications after BMT from an alternative donor in a larger number of patients with thalassemia.

For 10 patients HLA-DR and DQ polymorphysms had also been determined using molecular genetic analysis with sequence-specific oligonucleotides.

The patients, all mismatched at class II HLA, were MLC reactive. HLA disparity between recipient-donor pairs is shown in Table 2 . Three patients disparate for one antigen were homozygous at the mismatched locus and hence were a one locus mismatch with respect to rejection direction and no locus mismatch with respect to GVHD direction. All the remaining patients and donors were heterozygous at the mismatched locus, and therefore were disparate both in the direction of GVHD and in the direction of rejection. In two patients who received their BMT in 1982 typing of HLA class II antigens was incomplete. These patients had a positive MLC and were classified as class II HLA incompatible. (Table 3) .

In certain circumstances where adequate conventional treatment is not available and the search for an unrelated donor is impossible, BMT from an alternative related donor may become the only available approach for some patients. Most of our patients did not receive adequate treatment because this was impossible to give in their countries, due to religious reasons or to patient non-compliance with desferrioxamine.

One possible explanation of this high failure rate is that unlike hematological malignancies patients with non-malignant diseases, such as aplastic anemia and thalassemia have an increased risk of graft failure even after HLA-identical sibling BMT probably as a result of absence of prior immunosuppressive treatment, compared with patients with hematological malignancies. It has been suggested that the incidence of graft failure increases with the increasing degree of HLA disparity. 5, 24, 25 We could not confirm these data probably because of the small number of patients.
