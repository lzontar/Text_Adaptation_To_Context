            "text": "ABSTRACT-Radioactively labeled mouse mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) 60-70S RNA, obtained from virions grown In both murine and feline cells, was employed In molecular hybridization experiments to detect MuMTV-related sequences In the DNA's of rats (Rattus norveglcus). With the use of relaxed conditions of hybridization and assay for RNA-DNA duplexes, all strains of laboratory rats and feral rats examined were shown to possess endogenous MuMTV-related DNA sequences In the low repetitive range. These sequences were related to approximately 20% of the MuMTV genome and exhibited a melting temperature (Tm) approximately 5\u00b0C lower than MuMTV-speclflc proviral sequences In murine (Mus musculus) DNA\u00b7s. Certain colonies of the F344 strain of rat (Fischer) contained animals whose DNA's possessed additional MuMTV-related sequences. These sequences were related to the non-germ-line-transmitted, tumorassociated (TA) sequences of the highly oncogenic MuMTV (C3H). They were found In the DNA of some F344 rats and a cloned established F344 rat embryo cell line at a frequency of approximately one copy per haploid genome and exhibited a Tm 9\u00b0C lower than that of hybrid duplexes formed between radioactive MuMTV TA-sequence RNA and C3H mouse mammary tumor DNA. The DNA's of rats, therefore, contained two sets of sequences that were related to sequences of the MuMTV genome: One set was germ-line transmitted, whereas the other set appeared to be transmitted in some rats via a non-germ line or infectious process.-JNCI 62: 1279-1286, 1979. We have recently demonstrated that different strains of mice may differ both qualitatively and quantitatively in MuMTV-specific proviral sequences (1) . Whereas MuMTV is transmitted as a germinal provirus in GR mice (1, 2) , the comparably high oncogenic MuMTV of C3H/He and RIll mice are not (3) . The MuMTV sequences that are non-germ-line transmitted in C3H/He mice have recently been isolated by recycling radioactive MuMTV 60-70 5 RNA against an excess of C3H liver DNA from apparently normal mice. These MuMTV TA sequences hybridize to the DNA of early occurring C3H/He and RIB mammary tumors but not to the DNA of normal C3H/He and RIll organs (3) .",

            "text": "There are several possible explanations for the presence of these extra MuMTV sequences in the DNA of F344 rats and perhaps in other strains or colonies of rats not yet as thoroughly investigated. One explanation is that a rat virus related to the MuMTV, but as yet unknown, has infected and in some instances has jntegrated into the genome of F344 rats. This integration can be occurring in a manner similar to the integration demonstrated by mouse leukemia virus into mouse embryo DNA as described by Jaenisch (20) . The apparent integration of MuMTV(C3H) TA sequences in some F344 rats has a parallel in mice. As previously shown, these sequences are non-germ-line transmitted in C3H/He mice (3); however, a recent study (21) demonstrated the integration of these sequences as endogenous provirus in colonies of C3H/Bi mice. A second explanation of the results reported here involves a similar infection as described above but with a xenotropic or amphotropic variant of the MuMTV. This explanation is possible in light of the isolation of host range variants of MuMTV's that have the ability to infect heterologous cells in culture (11, 22, 23) . Other explanations are, of course, possible.",

The first set is present in the DNA's of all rats in the low repetitive range and is related to approximately 20% of the MuMTV genome. The second set of sequences, found thus far only in F344 rats, is slightly more diverged from the MuMTV genome than the endogenous sequences. These sequences are related to the part of the MuMTV genome that is nongerm-line transmitted in several mouse strains such as RIll and C3H/He. The role of these two sets of MuMTV-reIated sequences in the etiology of mammary neoplasia and other neoplastic diseases of the rat obviously merits further study.",

Animals.-Hamsters [stock Lak:LVG(SYR)] were obtained from Lakeview Hamster Colony, Wilmington, Massachusetts. Guinea pigs (Wright strain 2) were received from the FCRC, Frederick, Maryland. SD (Sprague-Dawley), W (Wistar), ACI (Irish), LEW (Lewis), OM (Osborne-Mendel), and F344 (Fischer) rats were obtained through the Small Animal Section, Veterinary Resources Branch, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. F344 rats were also obtained from the FCRC; Mason Research Institute, Worcester, Massachusetts; Charles River Breeding Laboratories, North Wilmington, Massachusetts; Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin; and Harlan Industries, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana. Tissues from germfree F344 rats (7) were supplied by Ms. M. Sacksteder, Leo Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research, Fe Lauderdale, Florida. Feral rats were supplied by Mr. H. Lester, District of Columbia Bureau of Community Hygiene, Vector Control Division, Washington, D.e.; and Dr. R. Marsh, University of California, Davis, California. F344 rats from NIH were tested for antibodies to adventitious viruses by either hemagglutination inhibition or complement fixation. The tests were performed at Microbiological Associates, Bethesda, Maryland, via the Office of Program Resources and Logistics, Virus Cancer Program, NCI. We tested for the following viruses: mouse pneumonia virus, reovirus, mouse encephalomyelitis virus, Kilham rat virus, Toolans H-I virus, Sendai virus, mouse adenovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and rat coronavirus. All results were negative.",
