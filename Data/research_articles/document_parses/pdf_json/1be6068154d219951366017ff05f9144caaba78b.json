Sehgal et al. examined the dynamics of coronary flow related to indomethacin treatment for ductal closure in premature infants. That study found a decrease in coronary flow immediately after treatment, and recovery 60 min after treatment [10] . Similar findings were reported using speckle-tracking echocardiography [11] . The initial decrease could result from an ischemic effect caused by indomethacin, reported to decreasing flow to organs like the intestines and kidneys [2, 5] . Our study, in accordance with the previous reports [10, 11] , though at different time points and different medications, did not show an increase in coronary flows 4.1 \u00b1 2.8 days post PDA treatment. Notably, the ductus was not closed after treatment in three out of the thirteen neonates in our study group. Another study by Sehgal et al. in premature infants examined the effects of ductal ligation on coronary flow at 1, 8, and 24 h after the procedure and suggest a postoperative increase in the coronary flow that did not reach statistical significance (baseline of 2.4 \u00b1 1.2 ml/min/kg to 3.3 \u00b1 1.2, 3.1 \u00b1 1.5, and 3.1 \u00b1 1.5, respectively; p = 0.09) [12] . They did demonstrate a significant increase in coronary artery flow relative to left ventricular output post PDA surgical ligation [12] . Harada et al. examined coronary flow after ductal ligation in children aged~1.8 years and showed an increase in coronary flow immediately after coil closure of PDA in the subset of patients with pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio of >1.5 [13] . While this could suggest a compromised flow while the PDA was open, this study population is different, being older and with longstanding PDA, and its findings cannot be generalized to the acute condition in small premature infants. Differences between studies during medical treatment, ours and others [10, 11] vs. surgical ligation [12, 13] could relate to a more severe condition compromising coronary flow prior to surgery. The hsPDA act as low vascular resistance circuit shunting blood from the systemic circulation to pulmonary, causing a wide pulse pressure with low diastolic arterial pressure. Doppler evaluation of the mesenteric, cerebral and renal artery showing reversal or absence of diastolic flow is pathognomonic of hsPDA [10] . The principal determination of coronary perfusion pressure is the difference between the aortic diastolic pressure and the left ventricular end diastolic pressure.

In addition, there were clinical and laboratory measures showing that the study group did have a hemodynamic clinically significant PDA.

In our study, we used the cardiac troponin T test since this test is considered a specific marker for myocardial ischemic injury, unlike other markers like troponin I and creatinine kinase [23] . The study group population was younger and with more comorbidities, which may raise concern for a confounding effect. For example, higher troponin values could be related to ischemic effects of respiratory distress syndrome [24, 25] . Hence, a multivariate analysis was performed and demonstrated troponin to be related significantly and independently to gestational age and ductus size. These findings may indicate that the PDA in our group was hemodynamically significant causing myocardial strain. It may also suggest that troponin was more or as sensitive as our echocardiography findings to the ductal effect on coronary flows. A previous study by El-Khuffash et al. found that PDA and large ductal size had significant correlations to higher troponin levels [23] , similar to our study results. They demonstrated normalization of troponin post treatment. An additional study evaluating the relation between PDA and troponin was conducted by Asrani et al. with similar conclusions [26] . The cumulative data might suggest that troponin level could be helpful in the assessment of clinically significant PDA. No follow up of troponin levels after ductal treatment or electrocardiography exams to demonstrate ST-segment depression [27] were made in our study due to technical difficulties. Future larger studies with troponin measurements before and after PDA closure could help strengthen the predictability of this marker, and may allow to set a threshold clinical level for hsPDA. To do that, more information regarding troponin levels in other conditions like placental insufficiency [28] , ashyxia [29] and respiratory distress syndrome [24, 25] is needed, because the current knowledge is limited.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 304, "end": 308, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 535, "end": 539, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 540, "end": 543, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1079, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1301, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1549, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1902, "end": 1906, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1917, "end": 1921, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1960, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1964, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Study limitations could affect our findings. Because the coronary arteries in premature infants are small in diameter and may undergo significant changes that could not be accurately measured during the echocardiography [14] the use of this tool may be misleading and operator dependent. Furthermore, small changes could dramatically affect the assessment of the flow. When we used FI as approximation for flow instead of calculating coronary flow taking into consideration the coronary diameter, we came to opposite results, showing an increase in FI with hsPDA (Table 3) . To assure that our results were accurate we performed an ICC analysis, that found that both the FI and the coronary flow measured by our senior cardiologist had good accuracy (0.77 and 0.78, respectively). Thus, taking into account the surface area of the LM coronary artery to assess flows, affected our results and interpretation of the data. In our study, a single senior cardiologist who has the expertise and the experience in evaluating coronary flow conducted all the measurements, reducing the possibility of human measurement error.

In addition, 28 infants were excluded due to good clinical condition, which may introduce selection bias to the study. The consideration for echocardiography testing was clinical and we did not interfere with the department's routine. Another limitation of our study is the different treatment protocols used during the study that could influence the results.
