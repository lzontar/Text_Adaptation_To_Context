An increased risk of infections has been described, being highest during the first month after each infusion, and decreasing over time. This spectrum includes viral infections, mostly by herpes virus (Wray et al., 2019) . Therefore, alemtuzumab carries a theoretical high risk of developing COVID-19 if the infection occurs before immune reconstitution and the general recommendation is postponing infusions until the pandemic is controlled (Brownlee et al., 2020; Costa-Frossard Fran\u00e7a et al., 2020; Giovannoni et al., 2020) . Interestingly, only a minority of patients develop severe infections. This means that some immunocompetence is maintained, probably because the remaining lymphocytes are functional, the depletion in lymphoid organs is scarce and the innate immune response is mostly preserved, since macrophages, NK cells and neutrophils have a low CD52 expression (Turner et al., 2013; Wray et al., 2019) .",

In some pwMS, especially young and otherwise healthy with highly active MS, the risk of a disabling relapse or disease progression might be higher than the risk of severe complications due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Brownlee et al., 2020) . On the other hand, given that innate immunity seems to be essential in the control of the virus (Baker et al., 2020) , it is possible that the risk of COVID-19 in our patients is lower than initially expected, since DMT in MS barely affect it. Moreover, a certain degree of immunosuppression might be protective because the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is related to a dysregulated immune response . Therefore, in selected patients we should consider continuing DMTs as planned, including alemtuzumab, if safe conditions are ensured: outside of the peak of the outbreak, availability of clean spaces in the hospital for the infusions and a proper self-isolation at home until immune reconstitution.",
