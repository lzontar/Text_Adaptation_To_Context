Most episodes of carriage result in improved immunity to future infection without the development of disease. As such, the mechanisms by which carriage is established, the immunity that results from carriage and the mechanisms that determine when carriage ends are all of critical importance in the design of mucosal vaccines against pneumococcal disease.",

Experimental human pneumococcal carriage has been safely established in two previous studies. [6, 7] From these studies, it is known that a variable proportion of those subjects inoculated with pneumococci become colonised. The variables determining carriage/non-carriage following inoculation are unclear. The rate of colonisation following nasal inoculation in these studies was reported as <50%, with a duration of carriage between 21 and 122 days. The immune response in nasal washings and serum showed an association between humoral responses (to protein and polysaccharide antigens) and carriage. The humoral and cellular responses in the lung that result in response to nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage have not been described.",

These proteins are common to the cell surface of all pneumococci. In addition, pneumolysin (Ply) is a cytoplasmic protein also expressed by all pneumococci. These surface and cytoplasmic proteins are both highly immunogenic and humoral responses confer protection against both invasive disease and carriage in mice [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Pre-existing antibody to cell wall polysaccharide has been demonstrated to be predictive of resistance to colonisation [6, 7] . Susceptibility to carriage does not appear to correlate with pre-existing levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the specific capsular polysaccharide. A rise in specific antibodies to protein (CbpA and PspA) during human carriage has also been demonstrated [6, 7] .",

Our group has recently demonstated the upregulation of Th17 lymphocytes in human lung following EHPC. Up-regulation of Th17 antigen-specific cells is consistent with enhanced protection against pneumonia; this could be tested in future by observing the association between Th17 response and vaccine protection against a pneumococcal challenge.",

We have previously demonstrated these responses to polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines [16] [17] [18] . Examination of individuals pre and post pneumococcal carriage, and comparison between the immune response of colonised against un-colonised subjects will provide new information on the innate, cellular and humoral immune responses to pneumococcal colonisation. In future this model will be used in testing the effect of new candidate vaccines. A major roadblock identified in the process of developing new protein vaccines has been a means of down-selecting from among the candidate antigen combinations proposed as vaccines -the EHPC model offers a means of doing just this by testing the effectiveness of candidate vaccines in blocking subsequent EHPC.",

None of these methods are clinically validated and so we will use conventional techniques to determine the primary endpoint.
