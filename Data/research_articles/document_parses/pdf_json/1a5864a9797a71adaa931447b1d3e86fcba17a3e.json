Complicating discovery of the sinister nature of a biological attack, however, is the fact that biological agents possess inherent incubation periods, a characteristic not shared with conventional, chemical, and nuclear weapons. These incubation periods, typically days to even weeks in length, allow for the wide dispersion of victims in time and space. Moreover, they make it likely that the \"first responder\" to a biological attack would not likely be the traditional first responder (fire, police, and paramedical personnel), but rather primary care physicians, emergency room personnel, and public health officials.

Moreover, in many cases, such findings present a very limited differential diagnosis. Smallpox is characterized by a very unique exanthem. The classic finding in inhalational anthrax is a widened mediastinum; in botulism, it is a descending, symmetric, flaccid paralysis. Although a single patient with flaccid paralysis should call to mind the possibility of disorders such as the Guillan-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and myasthenia gravis, the near-simultaneous presentation of multiple patients with flaccid paralysis should point one to a diagnosis of botulism. Similarly, plague victims often develop hemoptysis in the later stages of illness. Such a finding is otherwise uncommon among previously healthy individuals, but can be caused by tuberculosis, Staphylococcal and Klebsiella pneumonia, and carcinoma, among others. Multiple patients with hemoptysis, however, should prompt a diagnosis of plague. Yet, by the time each of these characteristic findings develops, treatment is likely to be ineffective. Therefore, therapy is best instituted during the incubation or prodromal phases of these diseases if it is likely to be of benefit. Because of this, and because many potential biological warfare diseases -such as tularemia, brucellosis, melioidosis, Q-fever, staphylococcal enterotoxin intoxication, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis are likely to present simply as undifferentiated febrile illnesses -prompt diagnosis is a possibility only with the maintenance of a high index of suspicion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "STEP 1.

Diseases unusual in a given locale, in a given age group, or during a certain season likewise warrant further investigation. Simultaneous outbreaks of a disease in noncontiguous areas should cause one to consider an intentional release, as should outbreaks of multiple diseases in the same area. Conversely, even a single case of rare disorders -such as anthrax or certain viral hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and many others)would be suspicious, and a single case of smallpox would almost certainly be the result of an intentional release. The presence, in the community or the environment, of dying animals (or the simultaneous occurrence of zoonotic outbreaks among humans and animals) might provide evidence of an unnatural aerosol release. Evidence of a disparate attack rate between those known to be indoors and outdoors at a given time should also be sought and evaluated.

Militarystyle protective clothing and masks, even if offered, however, would likely be unavailable at the precise moment of a release of agent. Moreover, the unannounced release by terrorists of odorless, colorless, virtually undetectable biological agents would afford no opportunity to don such gear, even if it were available.

The lone exception would be smallpox, where a high-efficiency particulate air filter mask would be ideal. With the exception of smallpox, pneumonic plague, and, to a lesser degree, certain viral hemorrhagic fevers, the agents in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) categories A and B (Table 9 .2) are not contagious via the respiratory route.

Anthrax vaccine-adsorbed (AVA; Bioport, Lansing, Michigan) was licensed by the U.S. FDA in 1970 and consists of a purified preparation of protective antigen (a potent immunogen, protective antigen is critical for entry of lethal and edema factors into mammalian cells; it is nonpathogenic when given alone). In a large controlled trial, AVA was shown effective at preventing cutaneous anthrax among textile workers (Brachman et al., 1962) . Based on an increasing amount of animal data, there is every reason to believe that this vaccine is quite effective at preventing inhalational anthrax as well. Moreover, at least 18 studies now attest to the safety of AVA (Cieslak et al., in press) . Nonetheless, logistical and other considerations make large-scale civilian employment of AVA impractical at present. The vaccine is licensed as a six-dose series, given at 0, 2, and 4 weeks, and again at 6, 12, and 18 months. Yearly boosters are recommended for those at ongoing risk. Further complicating any potential anthrax immunization strategy is the fact that AVA is approved by the U.S. FDA only for those persons 18-65 years of age. Although a large-scale pre-exposure offering of AVA to the public might thus be problematic, some authors allow that three doses of the vaccine, given in conjunction with antibiotics, may enhance protection and/or enable the clinician to shorten a postexposure antibiotic course (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002) . In this regard, a threedose series of AVA (given at time 0 and at 2 and 4 weeks after the initial dose), combined with 30 days of antibiotics, may be an acceptable alternative to longer (60-100 days) antibiotic courses alone in the treatment of, or postexposure prophylaxis against, inhalational anthrax.

Production of Dryvax \u00ae ceased in 1981 and lots currently in use are more than 20 years old. New generation vaccines are in production, however, and should be available very soon. Many health authorities have chosen to wait until these new products are available before readdressing the question of civilian vaccination. These new vaccines are produced in cell culture rather than calf lymph.

However, such an approach is currently hampered not only by the unknown risk of a smallpox release, but also by vaccine supply, safety, and logistics issues (Fauci, 2002; Amorosa and Isaacs, 2003) . The increasing number of persons at risk for severe vaccine reactions due to compromised immunity or dermatologic conditions (such as eczema) raises concern about the safety of a pre-exposure vaccination program in the era of epidemic HIV, organ transplantation, and immunosuppressive therapy (Bozzette et al., 2003; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003b; Grabenstein and Winkenwerder, 2003; Kemper et al., 2002) . In addition, the incidence of rare but severe smallpox vaccine complications in otherwise healthy recipients could result in a number of deaths and cases of severe disease that would be unacceptable were the risk of a smallpox release low. Risk analysis favors prerelease mass vaccination of the general population only if the probability of a large-scale or multifocal attack is high.

When the identity of a bioterrorist agent is known, the provision of proper therapy is straightforward. Our recommendations for such therapy are provided in Table 9 .3. When a clinician, in relatively austere circumstances, however, is faced with a Rifampin or clarithromycin may be acceptable alternatives to clindamycin as drugs that target bacterial protein synthesis. If ciprofloxacin or another quinolone is used, doxycycline may be used as a second agent, as it also targets protein synthesis. b Ampicillin, imipenem, meropenem, or chloramphenicol may be acceptable alternatives to penicillin as drugs with good central nervous system penetration. c Levoflxacin or ofloxacin may be acceptable alternatives to ciprofloxacin. d Assuming the organism is sensitive, children may be switched to oral amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/day \u03ec q8h) to complete a 60-day course. We recommend that the first 14 days of therapy or postexposure prophylaxis, however, include ciprofloxacin and/or doxycycline regardless of age.
