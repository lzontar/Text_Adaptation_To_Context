The RNA was eluted in 60\u03bcl of AVE buffer and used as template for all assays. For both assays, a 20\u03bcl reaction containing 5\u03bcl RNA template, 500nm each of forward and reverse primer, 150nm probe and 0.2\u03bcl QuantiTect RT mix was prepared using QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen).

Household cases AH1, AH2 and AH3 share identical sequences over the full genome length and differ by only 2 base differences from linked case AT1 as well as from early outbreak consensus sequences from Wuhan. All four linked cases in cluster A share a common base difference relative to the earlier sequences. The probability to have a shared base difference by chance is 3e-05 for any pair and 1e-18 for four sequences. Therefore, the genetic linkage of the 4 cases strongly supports the available epidemiological data. Methods: Phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor-Joining method [1] and confirmed to be consistent using Maximum Likelihood approaches (not shown). The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the 500 replicates bootstrap test are shown next to the subtree junctions [2] . The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the units of the number of base differences per sequence [3] shown below the branches. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 29891 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [4] . Strain names, GISAID EpiCoV accession numbers and collection dates are shown, followed by the case number if available.
