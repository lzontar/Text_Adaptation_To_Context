Under these unprecedented circumstances, there are no well-established guidelines for cancer patients. Recent Findings The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions. Since the emergence of the first case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, tremendous research efforts have been underway to understand the mechanisms of infectivity and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a fatal virus responsible for abysmal survival outcomes. To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately. Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy. Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease. Summary In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials.

ACE2 is expressed broadly in numerous tissues; however, lung alveolar epithelial cells are considered the primary targets [17] .

The common theme of these proposed guidelines is to categorize patients into high, medium, or low priority based on the Ontario Health Cancer Care Ontario criteria (Table 2) in order to plan their management course accordingly [106] .

Given the immunocompromised nature of the patient population, cancer centers have been adhering to strict infection control guidelines, in inpatient and outpatient settings. Outpatient visits, including ambulatory clinics and chemotherapy infusion visits, have been reduced [107] . Utilization of oral therapy regimens is recommended instead of parenteral anticancer therapies, if considered equivalent. This strategy can hence reduce patients' risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, without compromising oncological outcome, for instance, the use of capecitabine in place of 5-fluorouracil in patients receiving concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer [108] . Additionally, one must strongly consider delaying anticancer therapy in patients with stable cancer. Zhang et al. studied the outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19 on active anticancer therapy and reported more than fourfold higher likelihood of experiencing severe events in those who received therapy in the preceding 14 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (HR = 4.079, 95% CI 1.086-15.322, p = 0.037) [14\u2022 ]. However, for aggressive cancers, it is warranted to have a risk-benefit assessment and proceeding with cancer treatment if benefits outweigh risks. As precisely mentioned by Wang et al., the major risk factor for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is their inability to receive sufficient medical support [109] . To further minimize patient exposure to COVID-19, clinicians could consider the option of chemotherapy break and the possibility of performing home laboratory draws for toxicity assessment if feasible.

Despite these advisories, it is important for clinicians and patients to have risk assessment discussions prior to making treatment decisions. Part of the discussion should also entail resource availability, as surgeries often require post-operative care in the intensive care unit (ICU). Given the current shortage of ICU beds, it is important to delegate resources efficiently. In instances, specifically early stage cancers where surgery is often the first step in management, patients could be offered neoadjuvant therapy, and surgery could be delayed without compromising patient outcomes [104] .
