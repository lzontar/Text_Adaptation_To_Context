No simple, single-reaction diagnostic test currently exists for the simultaneous detection of major pathogens commonly associated with PRDC. Furthermore, the detection of most of the bacterial pathogens implicated in PRDC currently requires time-consuming culture-based methods that can take several days to obtain results. In this study, a novel prototype automated microarray that integrates and automates all steps of post-PCR microarray processing for the simultaneous detection and typing of eight bacteria and viruses commonly associated with PRDC is described along with associated multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR. The user-friendly assay detected and differentiated between four viruses [porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus, porcine circovirus type 2, porcine respiratory corona virus], four bacteria (Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis, Streptococcus suis), and further differentiated between type 1 and type 2 PRRSV as well as toxigenic and non-toxigenic P. multocida. The assay accurately identified and typed a panel of 34 strains representing the eight targeted pathogens and was negative when tested with 34 relevant and/or closely related non-target bacterial and viral species.

PRRSV (genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 15 kb. PRRSV is classified into two types with type 1 predominating in Europe and type 2 predominating in North America and Asia. PCV2 (genus Circovirus, family Ciroviridae) is a non-enveloped virus with a circular, covalently closed single-stranded DNA genome of 1767-1768 nucleotides (Meehan et al., 1997; Hamel et al., 1998) . IAV (genus Influenzavirus A, family Orthomyxoviridae) are enveloped viruses with a genome composed of eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. PRCV (genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae) are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positivesense RNA genome of approximately 28.5 kb. It was first isolated in Belgium in 1984, and it is a natural variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Pensaert et al., 1986 ) that contains a 5 0 deletion (621-681 nt in size) in the S gene which is used to differentiate PRCV from TGEV in PCR-based assays (Kim et al., 2000; Costantini et al., 2004) .

Some of these bacteria are of low pathogenicity and exist as commensals in the upper respiratory tract of healthy pigs.

Such methods (Grau-Roma and Segales, 2007) are time-consuming and require independent tests for each pathogen. Furthermore, the detection of bacterial pathogens typically depends on time-consuming culture-based methods that can take several days to obtain results. Due to their high sensitivity and ease of use, PCR and real-time PCR tests have been developed for several agents implicated in the PRDC; however, these tests typically target single pathogens (Lierz et al., 2008; Lomonaco et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2009) . A diagnostic test capable of simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens involved in PRDC (Atashpaz et al., 2009; Wernike et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012) would save time, labour and cost by providing more information with each test performed. A multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting five porcine viruses including two porcine respiratory viruses was developed (Giammarioli et al., 2008) . Duplex and triplex real-time PCR for porcine respiratory viruses have also been recently described (Chang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014) . However, to date, there are no diagnostic tests capable of simultaneous detection of multiple major viral and bacterial porcine respiratory pathogens in a single reaction. Microarray technology, with its capacity to incorporate a large number of capture probes, is a potentially useful tool for multiplexed detection and typing of pathogens. Here, a microarray assay with associated multiplex RT-PCRs for detection and differentiation of four viruses and four bacteria involved in PRDC using a novel user-friendly electronic microarray in which capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting are fully integrated and automated is described.

Microarray data were represented using the mean pixel intensity for each probe reaction. Probe reactivity was calculated using the mean pixel fluorescent intensity (MFI) of all probes as a ratio of the non-template control. Probe reactions above 29 the ratio of the non-template control were considered positive. Probes that showed good reactivity and specificity were selected for testing and validation on a novel automated electronic microarray in which capture probes are printed on streptavidin-containing acrylamide hydrogels and hybridization, washing and reporting are automated and computer controlled. Capture probes used on the electronic microarray were modified with 5 0 -biotin group to allow attachment to streptavidin-containing test sites (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). A selected set of 12 probes targeting the viruses, 14 probes targeting the bacteria and three control probes (a negative probe and two probes targeting the internal control), which exhibited high reactivity and specificity on glass slide microarrays, were selected for validation on the electronic microarray. The viral probes were tested against an expanded panel of 14 strains or isolates of the four target viruses and 14 non-target viruses (Table 3) . Similarly, the bacterial probes were tested against a panel of 20 strains or isolates representing the four target bacteria and 20 related or unrelated non-target bacteria ( Table 3 ). The electronic microarray assays were run using a protocol previously described (Lung et al., 2012) with modifications. The modifications included the replacement of the 'touch down' washing protocol with a 'touch up' protocol in which washing steps were carried out using Low Salt Buffer (Nexogen, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with incremental increases rather than decreases in temperature. Images were captured at each temperature increment. The Red Universal Reporter Probe was replaced with a 5 0 -Alexa Fluor 647 modified locked nucleic acid (LNA) variant (5 0 -/5Alex647N/TGT+CA+AGC-G+AT+AT+ACT+GC-3 0 ) (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) to increase its thermal stability over a more robust range of wash temperatures. All electronic microarray hybridizations were performed in duplicate, and a non-template PCR control (NTC) was included in all experiments. Raw fluorescent intensity (FI) data from all utilized electrodes at each temperature increment were obtained and analysed using Microsoft Excel. For each probe, positive-to-non-template control (P : N) ratios were calculated by dividing the FI value from each analyte by the FI value produced by the NTC. For each assay, samples that produced P : N ratios of 2.0 or greater were considered positive.

The electronic microarray has an open platform format with 400 test sites that can be individually activated and utilizes a single integrated instrument that automates capture probe printing and microarray processing using parameters set by the user.

The cost of consumables for testing a sample with an electronic microarray is expected to be between one and a few real-time PCR assays and will depend on the assay design (i.e. reducing the number of probes will decrease the cost by allowing more samples to be tested on each array with 400 test sites). In addition to glass and hydrogel (acrylamide)-based microarray matrices used in this study, the final probe sets have been tested successfully on reverse dot blots performed on nylon membranes (unpublished results). Thus, the probe set described should have broad applications in hybridization-based assays that use a variety of different matrices. Assays for simultaneous detection of multiple bacteria and virus implicated in PRDC have not been described previously. The limit of detection of a LAMP assay for PCV2 has been shown to be approximately 1 copy of DNA plasmid, much more sensitive than conventional PCR whose detection limit was 1 9 10 4 copies (Zhou et al., 2011) . However, LAMP assays typically detect a single pathogen and are difficult to multiplex. In multiplex real-time PCR assays, a duplex PCR assay had a detection limit of 1 TCID 50 /ml for PCV2 and 6.3 TCID 50 /ml for PRRSV (Chang et al., 2014) , while a triplex real-time PCR assay had a detection sensitivity of 10 copies/ll for PCV2 and PRSV and 100 copies/ll for PPV (Wu et al., 2014) . The multiplex PCR described here did not reduce the limits of detection for five targets although the detection limit of the PCR for three pathogens was an order of magnitude lower in the multiplex format. Thus, further improvements in sensitivity are desirable and may be partly achieved by increasing the number of PCR cycles, reducing amplicon lengths or reducing the amount of internal control used in the assay. The limit of detection for PCV2, PRRSV, and M. hyoneumoniae was lower with the electronic microarray in comparison with the multiplex RT-PCR indicating the use of the electronic microarray platform reduces sensitivity, and unpublished results show that only amplicons that were visible after agarose gel electrophoresis can be detected by the electronic microarray. Despite the reduced analytical sensitivity of the electronic microarray assay for some of the targets, the bacterial and viral targets were detected singly or in combination in clinical samples submitted for laboratory diagnosis. Furthermore, the assay detected P. multocida in a clinical lung sample that was not detected by traditional culture methods. This discrepancy may be due to the higher sensitivity of the microarray assay, or the lack of active infection (e.g. the use of antibiotics).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 976, "end": 995, "text": "(Zhou et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1238, "text": "(Chang et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1382, "text": "(Wu et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Isolates"}, {"text": "While primers and probes were evaluated using all sequences available on NCBI at the time of assay design and samples representative of both target and non-target bacteria and viruses were tested in this study, regular reevaluation of the coverage of the primers and probes and additional validation with clinical samples is desired.
