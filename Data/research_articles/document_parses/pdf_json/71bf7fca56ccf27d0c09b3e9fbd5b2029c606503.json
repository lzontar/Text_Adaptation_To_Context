However, this may depend on the overall number of COVID-19positive patients in the specific region and others consider patients only possibly positive if they display infectious symptoms or have been traveling to high-risk regions.",

However, in regions with a high disease rate of COVID-19, such as in Lombardy, all patients may be considered to be infective and the procedure should be performed in a dedicated COVID-19 cath lab. This may be possible because most of the European hospitals have significantly reduced or suspended elective procedures to preserve resources and avoid potential exposure of stable patients to the risk of COVID-19 infection. If timely reperfusion is not possible, some advocate fibrinolysis in this setting (. Fig. 1 ; http://www.escardio.org). However, all efforts should be made to deliver timely reperfusion even when taking all precautions to protect healthcare workers.",

Based on COVID-19 infection rates in the specific region, either only patients with suggestive symptoms or all patients with NSTE-ACS should undergo testing for COVID-19 as soon as possible following the initial medical contact in order to allow healthcare personnel to implement adequate protective measures and management pathways. Risk stratification should be based on the criteria as provided by ESC guidelines on NSTE-ACS [2] . Patients should be categorized into three risk groups (i.e., very high risk, high risk, and intermediate to low risk) and managed accordingly. For patients at very high risk, an immediate invasive strategy as in STEMI is required, whereas for high risk an invasive strategy within 24 h is appropriate. In this case, negative or even positive test results may already be available leading to strategies in different cath lab environments. For intermediate-to-low-risk patients, a medical strategy with early discharge may be more appropriate and these intermediate-risk patients should also be carefully evaluated taking into consideration alternative diagnoses totype 1 myocardial infarction, such as type 2 infarction, myocarditis, or myocardial injury due to respiratory distress or multiorgan failure or Takotsubo syndrome. In the event that any of the differential diagnoses seem plausible, a noninvasive strategy should be considered and coronary computed tomography angiography should be favored, if equipment and expertise are available.",

However, several reports have shown a significant decrease of STEMI patients admitted to cardiac catheterization laboratories in the range of 40% during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, times from symptom onset to reperfusion were four times longer in Hong Kong, China [4] . These observations may be understandable because people are reluctant to go to a hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. This would explain the potential delays in seeking special cardiological care. Another concern is that patients with ACS do not seek care at all. This is very likely to have a detrimental impact on outcomes in COVID-19 times, which induces collateral damage whose extent cannot be estimated at the current time.",
