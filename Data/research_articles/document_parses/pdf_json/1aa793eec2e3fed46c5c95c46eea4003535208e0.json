Here we analyze the dynamic Chinese guarantee network constructed from a comprehensive bank loan dataset that accounts for nearly 80% total loans in China, during 01/2007-03/2012. The results show that, first, during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the guarantee network became smaller, less connected and more stable because of many bankruptcies; second, the stimulus program encouraged mutual guarantee behaviors, resulting in highly reciprocal and fragile network structure; third, the following monetary policy adjustment enhanced the resilience of the guarantee network by reducing mutual guarantees. Interestingly, our work reveals that the financial crisis made the network more resilient, and conversely, the government bailout degenerated network resilience. These counterintuitive findings can provide new insight into the resilience of real-world credit system under external shocks or rescues.",

The guarantee relationship between two firms represents the responsibility of a firm (guarantor) to assume the debt obligation of another firm (borrower) if the borrower failed to meet its legal obligation of a loan (default). Based on the credit networks formed by the guarantee relationship, we can understand the systemic risk better by investigating the evolution of the credit system in downturn period. In particular, it is critical to identify the risk of cascading failure in the guarantee network caused by the failure of one or a few entities, because such cascading failure could potentially disrupt the connectivity and reliability of the whole credit system 3, 4 . Since the guarantee relationship can be naturally represented as networks, applying network science methods to the analysis of the cascading failures in financial networks has emerged as one of the most compelling and active research areas in economics and finance 5 .",

With the outbreak of 2007-2008 global financial crisis, Chinese government implemented the stimulus program worth of RMB \u00a54 trillion in 9 November 2008 to reduce the impact of the financial crisis on China's economy by investing hugely in infrastructure and social welfare by 2010. The credit condition was also loosen to encourage loan applications from firms 6 . This stimulus program, though successfully sustained China's economic growth and largely stabilized the world economy, has resulted in a surge in debt in China, and dramatic structural change of the credit system. There were a huge amount of loans going to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), many of which could not meet the credit standard to obtain loans before the stimulus program 7 . These SOEs could meet the loosened credit standard through guaranteeing each other 8 . Although many of these SOEs were saved by loans, economic studies suspected that the stimulus program could cause explosion of credit debt and trigger future disruptions in the financial system because of huge loans to low-quality firms [9] [10] [11] .",

Both in-and out-degrees exhibit a power-law distribution, with a slope (\u03bb in and \u03bb out ) ranging from 3.23 to 3.30, and 2.30 to 2.76, respectively, indicating that the guarantee network are scale-free, a property that commonly exists in real-world networks. In such a scale-free network, most firms have a small number of guarantee relationships, while a few hub firms provide/obtain guarantees to/ from many others. A closer examination of the loan guarantee data reveals that isolated mutual guarantee relationship (2-node (%)) is significantly more frequent than that would be expected for a random network generated (p-value = 0.002). Here, the random network ensemble is generated by the commonly adopted Directed Configuration Model (DCM), which is configured by the in-degree and out-degree sequences of the network. Please refer to (Squartini and Garlaschelli) 23 for details. The financial properties show that these isolated mutual guarantee couples are at the bottom of the whole system with low assets and credit line and high default rate, indicating that high-risk firms are more likely to obtain loans with the guarantee from firms that are also high-risk. We define two types of hubs: guarantor hubs and borrower hubs. The guarantor hubs are those giving guarantees to others most frequently (top 1% out-degree). The borrower hubs are those obtaining guarantees from others most frequently (top 1% in-degree). We find that the guarantor hubs are usually firms with large assets, liabilities, and credit line. About 15% of them are listed firms, (compared with 3.95 %, the listed ratio of the whole network). On the other hand, the borrower hubs tend to have medium amount of asset and liability, but with high default rate and risk rating. The overlap of guarantor and borrower hubs is rather small (around 15%) as compared with other real-world networks, echoing the aforementioned finding that guarantor hubs and borrower hubs have different characteristics.",

On the other hand, the average asset of the firms in the guarantee network increased, indicating that the failed firms were with a relatively lower asset as compared with those did not fail. The implementation of the stimulus program immediately stopped the decrease. Since then, the network had been increasing (almost linearly), even after the end of the stimulus program.

The network analysis shows that the guarantee network experienced dramatic changes during financial crisis and the stimulus program. The burst of mutual guarantees could be the main factor that influences the changes of the guarantee network. In this subsection, we used exponential random graph models (ERGM) 24 to verify the significance of the formation of mutual guarantee relationships. ERGM are a family of probabilistic models that identify the distribution over a specified set of graphs that maximizes the entropy subject to the known constraints 25, 26 . ERGM can effectively predict the edges as a function of these constraints, which usually represent the most important topological properties of the network structure 27 . It has been applied to analyze various networks in finance and economy, such as [28] [29] [30] 23 . Among all topological properties, network density and reciprocity are the defining characteristics of the guarantee network, and other properties are with similar patterns driven by the values of these two properties. Network density is the most basic property that had dramatic changes: first increasing because of many bankruptcies, and then decreasing because of many new loans and guarantees. Reciprocity is important because the stimulus program encouraged low-quality firms to obtain loans by providing mutual guarantees to each other. In addition, we have found that the reciprocal edges are significantly more frequent than that would be expected for a DCM null model (pvalue < 0.001, z-score > 3000) throughout the entire time period. Therefore, we adopt the reciprocity model 25 , which considers the number of edges and the number of reciprocal edges. The probability function of G is as follows:",

In this section, we examine the potential risk of cascading failures in the guarantee network using a simulation model.

Intuitively, the higher the leverage ratio a firm has, the more likely it would fail. The simulation is based on the aforementioned dynamic guarantee network and the financial characteristics obtained from real-world data. We simulate the failures of firms caused by random initial failures (random attack) in one month. In the simulation, \u03b4 is the average leverage ratio of firms from real-world monthly guarantee network data. k = 1.18, which is obtained by learning from the real data. Specifically, we adopt Eq.

First, China is the second largest economy in the world. The credit system is unique in many aspects (e.g., the significant role of indirect financing and bank credit in the credit system) as compared with those in many developed countries, making it important to examine how the uniqueness of the Chinese credit system is associated with the unique challenge in running the financial system, especially in crisis. Second, the credit guarantee relationship among Chinese firms are similar to those of other countries, as they are all following the standard procedure of commercial banks. Thus, the guarantee network is general, as well as the network science methodologies. If we have equivalent data for another credit system, the methods are directly applicable by calibrating the parameters of guarantee network and simulation model based on the new data. Many topological properties could be similar, such as the scale-free and small-world effects. In practice, it is very difficult to obtain similar nationwide guarantee system data. In such case, we still can use the topological and financial properties of the Chinese guarantee network as a baseline, and then calibrate the parameters to reflect our understanding of the guarantee system under consideration. For example, we may reduce the reciprocity to reflect the less prevalence of mutual guarantee behaviors in a non-Chinese credit system. Third, we have been witnessing crises frequently, particularly the 2019-2020 novel coronavirus pandemic, which may trigger another financial crisis in the near future. The results of this study provide needed data-driven insights into how the credit system may react and recover. Such insights are critical to the decision making not only in China, but elsewhere as well.",

These fine tuning did not directly change the monetary policy, but aimed to address the side-effect caused by the ultraloose monetary policy by making it more targeted, flexible and forward-looking [goo.gl/Nq9yA5]. It was perceived as a signal to change the monetary policy.
