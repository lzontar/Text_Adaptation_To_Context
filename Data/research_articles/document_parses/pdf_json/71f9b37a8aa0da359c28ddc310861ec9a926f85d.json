The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two-to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly",

Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, and whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.",

Indeed, survival was independent of overall glycaemic control, as assessed by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) on hospitalization. However, given the very small number of patients, this analysis has to be interpreted with caution. In the largest series of 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City in the US, it was only mentioned in passing that, of the patients who died, those with diabetes were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation or care in the ICU compared with those without diabetes, with no further information provided regarding the characteristics of those diabetes patients [17] .",

Age also played a major role (OR: 14) when diabetes patients > 75 years of age were compared with diabetes patients < 55 years of age. Previous long-term glucose control, as assessed by HbA1c measurement, was not significantly associated with the primary outcome, unlike early clinical (dyspnoea) and biological [elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)] markers of more severe disease. In fact, in age-and gender-adjusted non-linear models, plasma glucose concentrations at admission were significantly and positively associated with both the primary outcome and death by day 7. However, the negative impact of admission ambient glucose concentrations was no longer significant on multivariate analysis. It is also worth noting that diabetes-related disorders with severe hyperglycaemia, including ketosis and ketoacidosis, and also hypoglycaemic events were reported at the time of admission.",

On multivariate analysis, an increased BMI (already starting in the overweight range) was the only independent prognostic factor of COVID-19 severity, as assessed by the composite primary outcome in this large cohort of diabetes patients. Of major importance, however, having a history of vascular diabetes complications and treated obstructive sleep apnoea significantly increased the risk of death. In contrast, parameters of previous or admission glucose control and routine pharmacological therapies, including RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors, were not independently associated with such a prognosis.",

However, numerous factors may interfere with the relationship between COVID-19 infection and poor outcomes in patients with diabetes ( Fig. 1) .

This crucial point should be analyzed according to three separate periods: (i) prior to admission (assessed by HbA1c measurement); (ii) at the time of hospital admission (indicated by concomitant plasma glucose concentrations); and (iii) during the hospital stay (Fig. 1 ). An important message of the present results of CORONADO is that previous glucose control has no significant impact on severity of COVID-19 in people with diabetes who require hospitalization. Indeed, HbA1c levels were associated with neither the composite primary outcome nor the death rate [23] . Such results may seem surprising as chronic hyperglycaemia has long been known to damp down the immunological defences of diabetes patients [18, 27] . However, caution is still required, as HbA1c measurements were missing in about one-third of thestudied population. Thus, it would appear to be most prudent to wait for the final analysis of CORONADO in an even larger cohort before drawing any definite conclusions as to the role of patients' past glucose control on final outcomes. Moreover, as CORONADO was focused on hospitalized patients with diabetes, it is still not known whether poor glucose control might favour the occurrence of less severe COVID-19 infection in diabetes patients not requiring hospitalization.",

Of note in CORONADO, however, fewer of the people who died were using metformin. It has also been hypothesized that dapagliflozin (not available in France until only recently) can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load [46] . A large international randomized controlled trial is currently underway to investigate the potential role of dapagliflozin in both diabetes and non-diabetes patients with COVID-19 (Dapagliflozin in Respiratory Failure in Patients with COVID-19; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04350593). In ICUs, the proper use of insulin therapy is, without question, the mainstay therapy [33] . Nevertheless, in view of the major interest raised by COVID-19 in the diabetes population, it is anticipated that dedicated observational studies, and possibly randomized controlled trials, will be designed in the near future to investigate the various positive and/or negative influences of the available glucoselowering agents in patients with T2D when exposed to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [47] .",

The negative effects of obesity on the severity of COVID-19 [48] and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation [49, 50] have already been reported independently of the presence of diabetes. In addition, the CORONADO study has confirmed the deleterious role of obesity, and even overweight, in life-threatening outcomes in a large diabetic (mainly T2D) population with COVID-19 [23] . On multivariate analyses, BMI remained the only prognostic factor for the composite primary outcome. The negative impact of obesity on outcome was largely driven by its effect on tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation whereas its effect on mortality was considerably lower. While death is an unequivocal outcome, mechanical ventilation depends on both the physician's decision and patient's acceptance.",

Obese patients have impaired respiratory mechanics resulting from a combination of poor respiratory muscle strength, reduced lung volume, increased airway resistance and impaired gas exchange. In addition, more subtle yet complex interactions may arise between adipose tissue and the immune system [48, 51] . For instance, an overexpression of inflammatory adipokines from visceral fat depots can affect the immune response, impair chemotaxis and alter macrophage differentiation [52] . In addition, the inflammatory response of visceral, but also thoracic (epicardial and mediastinal), fat deposits can lead to an upregulation and greater release of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 [5] . It has been suggested that adipose tissue in people with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread and increased shedding, immune activation and cytokine amplification [53] . Indeed, it has even been hypothesized that excess fat might lead to the possible presence of ectopic fat deposits in the alveolar interstitial space, thereby directly exposing the lungs to viral infection. This, in turn, could aggravate the inflammatory infiltrate, a phenomenon that could then contribute to the massive oedema observed in COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation [50] .",

Of particular interest, in the CORONADO cohort, obstructive sleep apnoea was found to be an independent risk factor of early death, as were also elevated levels of aspartate transaminase (AST). While a previous history of NAFLD was not associated with the primary outcome, the elevated AST levels noted at admission may have been a reflection of liver cytolysis directly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection [56] or related to multiple-organ damage secondary to hypoxia, a systemic cytokine storm and/or haemodynamic shock [14, 57] . In fact, AST elevation has more frequently been observed in severe forms of COVID-19 infection, especially during hospitalization [56] . In a longitudinal retrospective cohort study of 5771 patients with COVID-19 in China, abnormal AST levels were associated with the highest mortality risk compared with other indicators of liver damage, with an HR of 4.81 with AST levels of 40-120 U/L and an HR of 14.87 when AST was > 120 U/L [58] . In a meta-analysis of 13 studies involving a total of 3027 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, AST > 40 U/L was associated with an OR of 4 for critical/fatal COVID-19 [12] .

However, not all studies reported the same BMI cut-off in association with greater risk of severe complications related to COVID- 19 . In CORONADO, a higher risk had already been observed in overweight patients with diabetes. However, an increased risk for the primary outcome appeared to be less pronounced in diabetes patients with grade-3 obesity (BMI \u2265 40 kg/m\u00b2). The authors considered this observation to be in agreement with the so-called 'obesity paradox' previously reported in ICUs in patients exposed to severe respiratory distress syndromes. Nevertheless, researchers in a French study reported higher risks if BMI was \u2265 35 kg/m\u00b2 [49] , whereas one US study [59] reported an even higher risk if BMI was \u2265 40 kg/m\u00b2 as did another large US study [60] in cohorts of COVID-19 patients not specifically focused on diabetes. In fact, it has been suggested that COVID-19 may be a challenge to the 'obesity paradox' [61] , although more data from patients with morbid obesity (BMI \u2265 40 kg/m\u00b2) are as yet required to support this conclusion [48] .",

In any case, given the potentially critical role of body weight and fat mass in determining the severity of pneumonia requiring respiratory assistance, it is important to systematically collect anthropometric information from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [63] . One noteworthy suggestion is that obesity could shift severe COVID-19",

Likewise, if adipose tissue related to obesity plays a deleterious role in the excessive immune reaction and inflammation, then diabetes patients with obesity might benefit to a greater extent from a pharmacological therapy that modulates cytokine activity, especially IL-6, and/or the complement system [50] . As such, tocilizumab has been proposed as a therapeutic option for compassionate use in patients with COVID-19 [66] . A recent observation has found that hyperglycaemia, both at admission and during the hospital stay, was associated with higher IL-6 levels and a reduced efficacy of tocilizumab, leading to poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients regardless of the presence or not of known diabetes [67] .",

The CORONADO study was designed to characterize the phenotype of patients with diabetes hospitalized for COVID-19, to determine the prevalence of the need for mechanical ventilation or death and to identify the prognostic factors associated with poorer outcomes. As the first such large-scale observational study, it has undoubtedly provided a major piece of the complex puzzle linking diabetes and COVID-19 infection: some prognostic factors have been identified, focusing on BMI in relation to the need for respiratory assistance and the presence of previous diabetes complications associated with risk of death. However, other answers still require further analyses in even larger cohorts, especially in order to reassess the influence of previous glucose control based on larger numbers of HbA1c measurements, which means that the final results of the CORONADO study are awaited with great interest. In addition, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19-which was not investigated in CORONADO-is certainly deserving of specific investigation. Moreover, the results of certain pharmacological therapies currently under investigation to improve the prognosis in high-risk populations, such as diabetes patients, are also likely to be available in the near future.
