Of all types of PPE, hospitals least frequently reported having eye protection equipment (other than face shields, which would serve a similar purpose) on hand. This likely indicates a preference for face shields over goggles among the responding hospitals and not a shortage of eye protection. However, because face shields are disposable, they may be more prone to supply shortages than goggles, which can be decontaminated and reused. All CAHs that responded to the question about the availability of N95 respirators in the facility indicated that such devices are available in at least 1 location-although not all locations-where COVID-19 cases are likely to present for care. Nearly all facilities reported keeping N95s in inpatient units and emergency departments; however, the survey also revealed some instances in which <50% of the other hospital-affiliated locations had N95s, such as urgent care clinics where patients with COVID-19 might present. Notably, given current federal guidance for optimizing supplies of respiratory protective devices in the healthcare sector, responding hospitals reported, in at least a few instances, using respirator types other than N95 filtering face-piece respirators (FFRs) in their respiratory protection programs.

More than half of facilities reported requesting that arriving patients, or patients and their accompanying parties, should wear face masks to contain potentially infectious respiratory sections.

For example, hospitals did not report uniformly following the CDC's recommended transmission-based precautions, which include contact and airborne precautions with additional face and eye protection (eg, goggles or face shields), when HCWs interact with potentially infectious COVID-19 patients. The largest group of facilities reported using a combination of contact, droplet, and airborne precautions plus eye protection, which may indicate that hospitals are following CDC guidelines. However, it was not immediately clear how, when, or why personnel would switch between droplet and airborne precautions. This lack of clarity was likely a limitation of the survey. The second most common response to this survey item indicated that hospitals were following contact and airborne precautions, potentially omitting eye protection necessary to protect HCWs under the prevailing CDC guidelines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Among the potentially more serious gaps is the finding that not all hospitals reported maintaining written respiratory protection programs. Where respirators are required to protect workers from infectious materials in the air, including SARS-CoV-2, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires such programs under its respiratory protection standard. 14 Having a written program also supports the implementation of requirements for fit testing, training, medical exams, and election and use of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified respirators appropriate to protect workers from respiratory hazards in the workplace. Not all hospitals reported complying with OSHA requirements for initial and annual fit testing. It is unclear whether this deviation from what would be expected under full compliance is due to hospital concerns over respirator supply usage associated with annual fit testing (ie, facilities may have decided on their own to temporarily bypass this requirement in an attempt to conserve respirators) or if an incomplete fit-testing protocol is the norm in such facilities.
