This reflects, in part, the frailty and vulnerability of older people living in care homes but has also, in part, been a consequence of the failure to include care homes in the systematic planning of a response to COVID, as well as a measure of neglect of standards and quality improvement in the sector. In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies in 2015. The standards consisted of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in nursing homes as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. The gravity of the concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as emerging insights on care improvement in nursing homes indicate that an update of these medical standards is timely. This was performed by the writing group from the original 2015 guidelines and is intended as an interim measure pending a more formal review incorporating a systematic review of emerging literature and a Delphi process.",

The urgency of so doing is partly due to the increasing numbers of people requiring residential care. By 2040, the world is projected to have 1.3 billion people over 65 years old (14% of the total population) compared to 506 million in 2008 [4] . While the majority of older people spend most of their later years living healthy, independent lives, the chances of needing NH care increases significantly with age. Currently around 4% of older people in Europe live in NHs [5] or in residential care institutions The number of people requiring institutional care is projected to increase by 127% and 111% in Germany and the UK respectively between the years 2000 and 2050 [6] . The ANCIEN (Assessing Needs of Care in European Nations) research project involving 20 EU member states provided estimates of future long-term care needs of older Europeans [7] . In this, a doubling of need for nursing and residential care beds from 2010 to 2060 was predicted in the Netherlands, and a 50% increase in Poland, the latter starting from a low base as is widespread in central and eastern European countries. This is necessitated in part by demographic changes affecting numbers and proportion of population age groups but also the changing nature of the health and healthcare needs of older people.",

We reported from a survey across members that only 12% of EUGMS countries had written medical care standards for physicians applicable to nursing home care provided by professional organizations [20] . In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies [21] . These standards comprised of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in NHs as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. Adoption of these standards is complicated by the fact that medical care is provided by a heterogeneous range of physician disciplines across Europe, in the main general practitioners, but also medical officers, internists or geriatricians [9] : only in the Netherlands is there a specific post-graduation career and training path to produce NH specialists (called 'elderly care physicians', distinct from geriatricians who have a longer training incorporating acute internal medicine of older people) [22] . Here we highlight the need for progress in widespread adoption and promotion of the EuGMS standards by drawing on the experience of the COVID pandemic.",

It would also better delineate care needs for the older person, whether continuing to live in the community or entering the NH. Such assessments have been shown to reduce deterioration in physical functioning and reduce need for contact with NH and emergency services in those assessed, as well as reducing levels of distress amongst their carers [23] . The role of the assessor, and associated multi-disciplinary team as required, is to act as a gate-keeper to NH care and advocate for the older person, ensuring older people receive continuing care in an environment appropriate to their needs and wishes. While old age psychiatry is not as yet recognized as a specialty in all European countries, the psychiatry section of the European Union of Medical Specialists recommended its development in 2013, and in general in countries where it is established it is accepted that geriatricians and old age psychiatrists will sufficiently understand their scope of practice to make due referral to the other specialism as required.",

It is clear that this cannot happen effectively without a mechanism for oversight and leadership for both individual nursing homes and also nursing homes within a region commensurate with provision of the range of services needed [24] .

The concern is that this task falls between the two stools of hospital-based specialist clinics and regular general practitioner (GP) input. For example, almost 70% of NH managers identified a lack of formal follow-up procedures for NH residents with stroke disease, one of the most prevalent comorbidities in NH residents [40] . Additionally, despite being reviewed more often by their GP than community dwelling older people, NH residents are less likely to be followed up by their GP after this review [41] . A structured format for review of chronic disease such as osteoporosis, heart failure or hypothyroidism, as well as a medication review and appropriately executed and supported advance care planning, seems the way forward, although this will obviously require increased support in terms of time and finances for the physician, responsible.",
