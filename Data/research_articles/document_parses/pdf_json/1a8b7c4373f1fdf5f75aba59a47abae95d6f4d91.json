            "text": "Developments in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are empowering those with severe physical afflictions through their use in assistive systems. Common methods of achieving this is via Motor-Imagery (MI), which maps brain signals to code for certain commands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is preferred for recording brain signal data on account of it being non-invasive. Despite their potential utility, MI-BCI systems are yet confined to research labs. A major cause for this is lack of robustness of such systems. As hypothesized by two teams during Cybathlon 2016, a particular source of the system's vulnerability is the sharp change in the subject's state of emotional arousal. This work aims towards making MI-BCI systems resilient to such emotional perturbations. To do so, subjects are exposed to high and low arousal-inducing virtual reality (VR) environments before recording EEG data. The advent of COVID-19 compelled us to modify our methodology. Instead of training machine learning algorithms to classify emotional arousal, we opt for classifying subjects that serve as proxy for each state. Additionally, MI models are trained for each subject instead of each arousal state. As training subjects to use MI-BCI can be an arduous and time-consuming process, reducing this variability and increasing robustness can considerably accelerate the acceptance and adoption of assistive technologies powered by BCI.",

While this is taken for granted by most people, those with severe physical impairments, such as quadriplegia, experience the breakdown of this communication system rendering them unable to perform the most basic physical movements. Modern technologies, such as BCIs, have attempted to ameliorate this through the use of brain signals as commands for assistive systems [39] . MI, a common paradigm for BCI control, requires the subject to simulate or imagine movement of the limbs on account of there being discernible differences in brain signals when moving different limbs [1] . Due to it being non-invasive and costeffective, EEG is the method of choice for collecting data for such systems [1] .",

One such task -the BCI race -has the participants (called pilots) control a virtual game character via brain signals only. Competing teams, who may hail from either academia or industry, are responsible for creating BCI systems and training their respective pilots. The goal of the Cybathlon is to push the state-of-the-art in BCI assistive systems, and accelerate its adoption in everyday lives of those who need it most.",

In order to achieve high scores in the competition, a major part of BCI development is the focus on robustness of the system i.e. minimizing the variability of the system for different sessions and environments. Lack of robustness, in fact, is an established concern in almost all BCI systems. Possible causes of the problem include nonstationarity of EEG signals (variance for the same subject) [59] [56] . An additional cause, as noted by participating teams in Cybathlon 2016, is the change in the subject's emotional state. During the race, As expected, a public event such as the BCI race, the pilots' stress stress levels increased. This is to be expected as a public event such as the BCI race can heighten stress. This change in the pilots' emotional state caused their respective BCI systems to perform sub-optimally.",

In order to achieve this, we develop VR environments to induce high and low arousal in the subject before recording MI data. VR environments have been previously used along with EEG to prompt changes in emotional arousal [5] . Additionally, they have been used together with MI for treating Parkinson's disease [32] . To our knowledge, this is the first work where VR environments are used to increase robustness of MI-BCI systems. Subsequently, learning algorithms are trained, not only for MI but also for different arousal states. The idea is that during the BCI race, we first detect the pilot's emotional state of arousal, and choose the appropriate MI classifier. Due to COVID-19, many steps in the above mentioned outline had to be modified, the details of which are present as follows.",

A similar course of events was observed for the pilot of Mirage91, who after achieving an average runtime of 120 s in the days leading up to the Cybathlon, dropped to 196 s during the competition. The authors indicated that the pilot was showing signs of nervousness on competition day, with a heart beat of 132 beats per minute (bpm) prior to the race [51] .",

It proposes that all emotions can be described as a combination of two properties: valence and arousal. These can be thought as orthogonal axes in two-dimensions. Neurologically, it entails that any emotional state is a result of two distinct and independent neural sub-systems [42] . Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the circumplex model.

Similarly, VR environments, particularly those with natural scenery e.g. a forest, have shown efficacy in reducing stress [2] [3] . We thus developed two VR environments: one where the subject was placed on top of a skyscraper, called 'Height' while the second in a relaxing forest called 'Relaxation.'

Start with 60s of inducing high arousal via the \"Height\" environment, then record MI data for 45s. Repeat the same with \"Forest\" environment for relaxed state. Repeat this process for each trial. The MI data was to be recorded by using the common paradigm of showing the participant a cue on screen (typically left or right arrow) which would prompt them to imagine as if they were moving their left or right hand [44] [40] [27] . 4) Train an arousal classifier.

As mentioned previously, due to numerous factors, many steps in the above formulation had to be either abandoned (2 and 3) or modified (4 and 5). The revised scheme, replaced steps 4-6 with the following: 1) Train a cross-subject classifier replacing the arousal classifier. The task of this classifier is to take EEG as input from any of the two subjects, and classify the input as belonging to either subject 1 or 2. As the classifier is agnostic to the subject, the same pre-processing had to be done for each subject's data. 2) Train separate MI classifiers for each subject instead of training for each emotional state. 3) At test time, sample a run of a few data points (5 in our experiments), feeding them to the cross-subject classifier.

We first applied a Butterworth bandpass filter [11] to extract frequencies within the range 2-60 Hz. We then analyze the data for artifacts. A common source of artifacts in MI data is noise from electrodes located in the forehead's proximity. This is in fact data collected from the Electrooculography (EOG) channels which detect movements such as eye blinks, which may show up in the MI data. Such noise can be detected by first performing independent component analysis (ICA) -widely used in EEG preprocessing [30] -which tries to decompose a signal into constituent component under the assumption of statistical independence. We then see which of the resultant components correlates most with EOG channels, and filter it out [57] . An example of ICA on subject 1 can be seen in figure 4 . We filter out the first component which seems to be picking up an eye blink. ICA on subject 2 did not improve the results.",

In principle, feature extraction in BCI takes two forms: frequency band selection and channel selection (also known as spatial filtering). In regards to the former, we've previously mentioned in II-C that alpha and beta bands have been shown to be most related to MI activity. Accordingly, we use these frequency bands as our features. In the same section we observed that channels C3 and C4 are the most relevant for MI, which we can use directly without any spatial filtering. For this, instead of using raw alpha and beta patterns, we opt for logarithmic sub-band powers of said patterns (see gumpy documentation 2 ). Each spectrum is divided into four sub-bands. An alternative approach for feature extraction in MI classification has been the use of the \"common spatial pattern (CSP)\" algorithm [22] . It tries to find optimal variances of subcomponents of a signal [43] with respect to a given task. In our experiments, however, CSP performed poorly compared to logarithmic subband power of alpha and beta bands. The results when CSP was applied have thus been omitted from the report, but could be reproduced in the notebook (see section IX-A). A visualization of the features using PCA for both subjects can be seen in figure 5 . As can be observed, the features for subject 2 are more conducive to discrimination of MI. This is also verified in the training results, where every classification algorithm achieved higher accuracy for subject 2 compared to subject 1.",

The entire training procedure is visually depicted in figure 6. After doing feature extraction, we first train an MI classifier for each subject with labels 0 and 1 (left and right hand movement respectively). Subsequently, we combine data of both subjects, labelling it 0 and 1 (subject 1 and subject 2 respectively) and train the cross-subject classifier. All classifiers described in III-E are trained in each case, the results of which can be seen in table I. a) MI classification: The data for each subject was divided into an 80-20 split (training-test). The features were also standardized by rescaling to zero mean and unit standard deviation. Results for both subjects were satisfactory, although subject 1's data was harder to train on compared to subject 2. b) Cross-subject classification: Training for crosssubject classifiers followed the same procedure of feature extraction with the only difference being a re-labeling of the samples from limb movements to source subject. Once again, we split the data into 80-20 (train-test) portions, though this time the data is the combined samples from both subjects. For testing the classifiers, we split the test set further into sections containing five samples (trials) each. For each section, we take the mode (most frequent prediction) of the classifier which is considered the final result. For example, if our test data has 50 samples from each subject, we portion it into 20 sections (each subject with 10 sections). We then feed each section to the classifier and take the majority score for that section as the classifier's prediction. As can be seen, the ensemble model outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a considerable margin. In addition to this, we also created t-SNE embeddings of the features with 2 and 3 dimensions [26] .

Broadly, we can categorize psychology and neuroscience as brain sciences and computer graphics and artificial intelligence under the umbrella of informatics. Each of the two disciplines contributed unique methods and insights without which the project may not have come to fruition. The most valuable insight was the difficulty in training accurate machine learning algorithms for EEG. Although machine learning has become the dominant paradigm for classification tasks, this project demonstrates that pre-processing of data (via techniques such as ICA and log power-band) is at least as important to the success of the system as the classifier (the results for other feature extractors can be reproduced in the provided notebook), and even after pre-processing, we have no guarantees of robust performance.

While COVID-19 enforced certain constraints on data acquisition, we were still able to develop a proof-of-concept for how emotion-robust MI-BCI systems could be trained. Our results indicate that if the training signal contains sufficient information i.e. each emotional state has a distinct enough EEG signature, we can successfully train systems that are robust to variance in emotional arousal.

            "text": "1) What would you do differently next time in your experimental/technical setup? A major challenge, compounded by COVID-19, was the collection of arousal data. We were originally planning to use the Biopac system (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, California, United States) for measuring skin conductance. The procedure is involved and somewhat cumbersome, and could have been substituted with a heart rate sensor. Heart rate measurement is also an indicator of emotional arousal levels, and has the added benefit of being present in a smart watch. This would have made data acquisition simpler. Another important step would have been to test the efficacy of VR environments in inducing high/low arousal in systematic trials under control. Although there already exists evidence that VR has been known to impart such states, to observe its effect on EEG data would have been desirable. Finally, while classic machine learning is still widely used in MI classification, we observed, at least in subject 1's case, the difficulty in training a robust classifier. Perhaps opting for deep learning, which has shown increased performance in other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, may have been promising. 2) What went really good/easier than expected? The creation of VR environments was surprisingly simple due to vast community support for Unity 3D. Integrating VR controls in the environments was slightly more involved but went rather smoothly. Regarding training: Besides feature extraction, training the classifiers was fairly straightforward. This was in part due to previous experience working with machine learning and in part because of easy-to-use implementations of common algorithms in existing libraries. 3) What kinds of skills would you need to learn in your studies to do such a project even better (machine learning, statistics, psychology, neuroscience)? Taking a course on BCI prior to working on this project would have substantially accelerated development. Trying to get familiarized with methods and terminology of the field was a major part of the project, but it also entailed allocating time for such self-study which could have been dedicated to development had prior knowledge in this domain been acquired. Thus a course on neurofeedback and BCI would have made the project better. 4) If you tried out an approach which you later on abandoned, you can report this here as well. Give reasons why you decided not to pursue this approach. During the training of MI classifiers, initially I used data from certain sessions for each subject. This yielded scores with high variance, even for the same subject for different sessions. I abandoned this by taking data from all sessions for each subject and using that for training instead.",
