In fact, political and health measures have been taken, having in consideration what is supposed to be known about populations at risk (focusing on their baseline co-morbidities) and also identifying those that present a higher chance of being infected by COVID-19 (focusing on their clinical symptoms). However, clinical manifestations are highly variable and the quality of the evidence that underlies these strategies and decisions is frequently not known. We consider that the creation of a predictive model that could help identify those at higher risk of having COVID-19, built on their baseline clinical features (such as sociodemographic, symptoms and presence of co-morbidities), could help prioritize screening and therapeutic strategies. The first step to accomplishing such endeavour is to list the most pertinent variables to be included in such a model. For all this, we have conducted a scoping review to summarize and critically assess articles describing baseline characteristics of individuals infected with COVID-19. In Table 1 , we can see that, from the included studies, 50 (89%) were from China. We were able to identify only two studies from United States of America (USA), one from Canada, one from Korea, one from Singapore and one multicentre study that included patients from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain and Sweden. No study from Africa or Australia was retrieved.",
