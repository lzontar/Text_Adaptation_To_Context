With a worldwide estimated prevalence of around 5% in school-age children, ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions in child and adolescent mental health services. 1 Impairing ADHD symptoms persist in adulthood in up to 65% of the cases. 2 As such, a sizeable portion of patients treated within mental health and primary care settings present with ADHD. National and international guidelines (e.g., those from NICE 3 or the American Academy of Pediatrics, APA 4 ) include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies for the management of ADHD. Medications for ADHD encompass psychostimulants (e.g., methylphenidate and amphetamines) and non-psychostimulants (e.g., atomoxetine, clonidine and guanfacine). Non-pharmacological treatments recommended within evidence-based guidelines include behavioural parent training programmes for ADHD in childhood and cognitive behavioral therapies for (young) adults.",

When possible, home monitoring of blood pressure and pulse using home blood pressure machines is recommended, following the guidance detailed in Table 2. insert Table 2 around here This advice is particularly pertinent for adults and children/adolescents who have previously been recorded as having increase pulse and/or blood pressures. We note here that, on average, modest increases in heart rate (3-10 beats/min), diastolic (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) mm Hg) and systolic (2-14 mm Hg) blood pressure are found in patients treated with psychostimulants or atomoxetine (while clonidine and guanfacine tend to decrease blood pressure) and only about 2% of children/adolescents discontinue their medication due to any cardiovascular adverse event. 15 If measured at home, BP and HR values should be measured at approximately the same time on three separate days and the readings sent to the prescribers, who should average them and assess this value against expected age adjusted norms. As recommended in routine practice, and regardless of the availability of home blood pressure monitoring, patients should contact their prescribers should they experience any emerging cardiovascular symptom (e.g., chest pain, prolonged palpitations, and breathing difficulties).
