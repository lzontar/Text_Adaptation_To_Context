The RT-PCR product was cloned into a TA cloning vector (yT&A vector; Yeastern Biotech), to generate the construct.

The real-time RT-PCR amplification program was as follows: 20 min at 60\u040aC, for reverse transcription; 2 min at 95\u040aC, to denature the cDNA; 45 cycles of 5 s at 95\u040aC and 10 s at 60\u040aC, for amplification; and 30 s at 40\u040aC, for cooling. The sensitivity of this real-time RT-PCR was \u044010 copies of in vitrotranscribed RNA, and the linear regression coefficient of the standard dilution series was 0.99 to 1. To investigate possible inhibitors in the clinical specimens, a spike assay with 100 copies of the in vitro-transcribed RNA was performed on randomly selected HCoV-NL63-negative specimens, including 20 rectal swabs, 10 throat swabs, and 8 serum specimens.
