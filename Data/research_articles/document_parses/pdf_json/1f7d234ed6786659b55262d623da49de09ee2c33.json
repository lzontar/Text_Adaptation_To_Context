B cells 61 carry immunoglobulin (Ig) surface receptors with a high range of specificity that can directly 62 recognize different antigens. Early during acute infections upon the encounter with the 63 antigen, B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), including plasmablasts and 64 plasma cells, which produce large quantities of pathogen-specific antibodies (3). 65 66 ASCs can expand to very high levels during some acute human infections (4-7). For example, 67 during human dengue virus infection, ASCs expand to constitute an average of 47% of all 68 circulating B cells (5). Meanwhile, at steady state conditions in healthy individuals, ASCs 69 comprise only up to around 1% of all circulating B cells (5). The ASC response is typically 70 transient, peaking at around day 7 of the febrile stage of infection (8). However, during acute 71 human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, ASC response could be detected for as 72 long as 22-45 days after the onset of symptoms, which was found to be associated with 73 FACSDiva Software (BD Biosciences). For a detailed gating strategy see Supplementary Fig. monoclonal antibody conjugates were used for cell surface staining: anti-CD8-161 Qdot605 (3B5) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-CD19-BUV395 (SJ25C1), anti-CD14-V500 162 (M\u03c6P9), anti-CD4 -BUV737 (RPA-T4) (all from BD Biosciences), anti-CD123-BV510 163 (6H6), anti-CD27-BV650 (O323), anti-CD20-FITC (2H7), anti-CD38-BV421 (HB-7), anti-164 IgD-PE-Cy7 (IA6-2), anti-IgM-BV785 (MHM-88) (all from BioLegend), anti-CD3-PE-Cy5 165 (UCHT1), anti-CD56-ECD (N901) (all from Beckman Coulter), and anti-IgA-APC 166 (REA1014) (Miltenyi). LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher 167 Scientific) was used as a viability marker.

Although not all 423 patients in the present cohort had detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies at the 424 time of sampling, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific ASCs could be detected in all 425 patients using the FluoroSpot assay. In addition, we showed a clear relationship between the 426 levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and total SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies. 427This suggests that standard serological assays may inform about the levels of neutralizing 428 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, which may offer protection from a re-infection. 429Additionally, tools employed in this study may be of relevance in the assessment of long-430 lasting immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. 431432The expansion of ASCs in the present cohort of COVID-19 patients highlights an active B 433 cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The frequencies of ASCs within the total circulating 434 B cell population were highly variable between COVID-19 patients, ranging from 3 to 31%. 435Although the patients in this cohort were sampled at different timepoints following the onset 436 of symptoms, a high variability in ASC frequencies have also been observed among patients 437 infected with influenza or dengue virus sampled at normalized timepoints (e.g., 7 days after 438 febrile illness) (4, 5). Although ASCs have been shown to expand to very high levels in some439 viral infections, constituting up to 50-80% of all peripheral B cells, the highest ASCs 440 frequency in this cohort of COVID-19 patients was 31% (5, 7, 21). Healthy controls in this 441 study had very low frequencies of ASCs in the circulation, a finding consistent with previous 442 observations (5, 6, 16). 443 444 The ASC response in peripheral blood is usually transient and peak at around 7 days after the 445 onset of febrile illness, dropping to steady-state levels 2-3 weeks later (8). Interestingly, we 446 observed a substantial ASC expansion as late as 19 days following symptom debut. This 447 finding highlights the similarity between COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 448 infection, where a significant ASC expansion could be detected as late as 22-45 days after the 449 onset of symptoms (9). The prolonged ASC expansion in RSV infection was associated with 450 longer RSV shedding in the airways. Thus, the kinetics of ASC response may be dependent 451 on pathogen persistence. In support of our findings, a recent report on longitudinal immune 452 responses in a single COVID-19 patient with mild disease showed the peak of ASC 453 expansion at day 8 after symptom onset, but a substantial ASCs response could still be 454 detected by day 20 (22). Thus, it remains to be investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 455 persistence in the airways may lead to a prolonged ASC response in circulation. 456 457 The expansion of ASCs is usually characterized by high specificity towards the infectious 458 agent (17). Here, we successfully demonstrated that COVID-19 patients generate SARS-459 CoV-2-specific ASC responses using a FluoroSpot assay. We were able to successfully 460 identify SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA-, IgG-and IgM-ASCs in all COVID-19 patients. The 461 frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific ASCs within the total ASC population in this patient 462 cohort was relatively low. However, since only the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was used to 463 detect specific ASCs in this study, the numbers of N protein-specific ASCs do not reflect the 464 overall magnitude of the specific ASC response. The use of SARS-CoV-2 viral lysate or 465 recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in combination would allow for the evaluation of the 466 overall ASC response. Furthermore, the FluoroSpot assay described in this study could be 467 adapted to evaluate memory B cell responses to various SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 468 convalescent COVID-19 patient samples. The protective level of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 has not yet been 471 determined. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients showed a 472 strong SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing capacity in vitro and in vivo in transgenic mice expressing 473 human SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (23). However, extensive longitudinal studies in 474 humans are required to investigate if recovered COVID-19 patients are protected from re-475 infection with SARS-CoV-2. Seroconversion in COVID-19 patients, measured by detectable 476 SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels, has been recently shown to take place within nineteen days 477 after the onset of symptoms (24). The four patients in the present COVID-19 cohort without 478 detectable neutralizing antibody titers were sampled at days 7, 8, 9, and 15 after symptom 479 debut. Although these four patients did not have detectable neutralizing antibody titers, 480 SARS-CoV-2 specific ASCs were detected. This indicates that the FluoroSpot assay may be 481 a more sensitive method to detect early B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, compared to 482 standard serological assays. 483 484 In this cohort of patients, 2 out of the 4 patients with undetectable neutralizing antibody 485 levels had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum. Currently, the extent to which neutralizing 486 antibodies contribute to the control of viremia in COVID-19 is unclear. Our results seem to 487 suggest that neutralizing antibodies may not be the only player in SARS-CoV-2 control in 488 circulation, as one patient with substantial levels of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in 489 this cohort had detectable serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A pilot study assessing the 490 effectiveness of COVID-19 patient treatment with convalescent plasma containing SARS-491 CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies found that the treatment reduced viral load in patients within a 492 few days after administration, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies have a role in the 493 management of viremia in COVID-19 (25).",

            "text": "Rapid serology tests are essential for COVID-19 diagnostics and for national serosurveillance 496 programs. Neutralizing antibody tests, however, are usually laborious and time-consuming. 497Therefore, diagnostic tests often rely on other methods such as ELISA. Antibody levels 498 detected by ELISA, however, do not necessarily reflect the neutralization capacity of patient 499serum. Here, we demonstrated a strong correlation between SARS-CoV-2-specific and 500 SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody titers. These data suggest that the levels of SARS-CoV-501 2-specific antibodies measured with ELISA may reflect the capacity of serum from COVID-502 19 patients to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. 503 504 COVID-19 patients generally present with decreased lymphocyte numbers in peripheral 505 blood, which is particularly pronounced in severe cases (19, 26, 27). T cells appear to be the 506 most affected lymphocyte subset. In agreement with these observations, we found decreased 507 numbers of lymphocytes, and significantly lower T cell numbers in the present cohort of 508 COVID-19 patients. 509 510 In addition to lymphopenia, COVID-19 patients typically display increased concentrations of 511 inflammatory cytokines in serum, especially in severe cases (19, 27). The levels of 512 inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP, in particular, have been shown to correlate with disease 513 severity in COVID-19 patients (19, 20). In this cohort of COVID-19 patients we also 514 observed increased levels of IL-6 and CRP, with comparable median values to those 515 measured by Liu et al. in severe COVID-19 patients (20). We show that higher IL-6 and CRP 516 levels were observed in patients who were hospitalized for longer, suggesting that these 517 markers may be of use in predicting the duration of COVID-19. 518 Lastly, we observed an inverse correlation between IL-6 levels and SARS-CoV-2-520 neutralizing antibody titers in COVID-19 patients. This relationship may indicate that the 521 lack of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies leads to higher inflammation, or that high levels 522 of inflammation impair or delay antibody responses. Further studies where a longitudinal 523 patient sampling at controlled timepoints is performed are required to describe the 524 relationship between inflammation and humoral responses in COVID-19. 525 526 Taken together, we provided a detailed description of clinical and immunological parameters 527 in twenty COVID-19 patients, with a focus on B cell and antibody responses. We 528 demonstrated that COVID-19 patients elicit a SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell response, 529 indicated by the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific ASCs. In addition, we showed a clear 530 relationship between the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and total SARS-CoV-2-531 neutralizing antibodies. The tools employed in this study may be of relevance in the 532 assessment of long-lasting immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.",

Fluorescent spots indicating a single ASC were detected with an IRIS FluoroSpot 185 reader and counted with Apex software (Mabtech). 186 Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 188 A full-length nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein nucleotide sequence (1293 base-pairs) of the 189 SARS-CoV-2 virus was optimized and synthesized (Genscript). The synthesized sequence 190 was cloned into a PET-30a(+) vector with a carboxyterminal His tag for detection of protein 191 expression in E.coli. The E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) was transformed with the 192 recombinant plasmid and a single colony was inoculated into TB medium containing 193 antibiotic and cultured at 37\u00b0C at 200 rpm and then induced with IPTG. Protein purity and 194 molecular weight were determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot according to standard 195 50 \u00b5L of serum were mixed with 150 \u00b5L of EMEM (Gibco) and added to confluent Vero E6 199 cells seeded in 24-well plates. Cells were incubated with diluted serum for 1 hour, and 1 mL 200 of Vero E6 medium was added after the incubation. Cells were subsequently incubated 201 further for 10 days at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 and monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) by 202 Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/SWE/01/2020, 206 accession number MT093571) for 24 hours, trypsinized and mixed with uninfected Vero E6 cells, and then seeded on microscope slides. Twelve hours later, slides were fixed in acetone 208 and stored at -80\u02daC until further use. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u02daC for 30 209 minutes prior to analysis. For analysis of total SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers, serum 210 samples were serially diluted from 1:20 to 1:5120. 25 \u00b5L of diluted serum was then added to 211 fixed cells and incubated at 37\u02daC for 30 min, after which the slides were washed in NaCl for 212 30 min. Bound SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were then detected by incubating for 30 min at 213 37\u02daC with a secondary AF488-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG antibody (Jackson 214 Immunoresearch), diluted 1:200 in 0.1% Evan's Blue. SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive cells were 215 visualized using a Nikon Eclipse Ni fluorescence microscope (x40 magnification). The titer 216 of IgG in each serum sample was determined by the inverted dilution factor value for the 217 highest dilution with positive staining. 218 SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum were detected using anti-SARS-221 CoV-2 ELISA kits (both from Euroimmun), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 222 SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies were detected using EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-223 19 IgM ELISA kit (Epitope Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum 224 samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u02daC for 30 minutes prior to analysis. 225 IL-6 levels in serum from patients and healthy controls were measured in freshly thawed 227 serum using human IL-6 ELISA development kit (Mabtech), according to the manufacturer's 228 instructions. Serum samples were diluted 1:2 in ready-to-use ELISA diluent (Mabtech) prior 229 to performing the IL-6 ELISA assay.230",
