Second, the data provided by widespread testing will better inform the need for the current social distancing policies (e.g., sheltering at home, avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people, keeping at least 6 feet away from other people and temporarily closing schools, universities, daycare centers, major sports leagues, cultural events and public spaces) (Stock, 2020) . Third, testing provides data about the asymptomatic rate in the USA (the share of infected people who show no or very mild symptoms) and insight into how close Americans are to developing herd immunity to COVID-19.

A second-best scenario is random sample testing (Stock, 2020) .

This strategy, however, could lead to a systematic selection biaswe will only test those individuals who prefer to learn their health status regarding COVID-19; a significant fraction of people might not want to know. These individuals might find that their private costs outweigh any social benefits from not infecting others. This implies that they might want to avoid testing.

While standard economic theory suggests people never ignore information that enables them to adjust behavior (Stigler, 1961) , many new studies find that people willfully ignore medical diagnoses, even when such knowledge would enable them to adjust behavior to better accommodate their health condition (Sharot & Sunstein, 2020) . For example, we see willful ignorance in many people at risk for breast cancer (Thompson et al., 2002) , Alzheimer's disease (Cutler & Hodgson, 2003) , HIV (Hightow et al., 2003) and Huntington's disease (Oster et al., 2013) . The study by Ganguly and Tasoff (2017) is particularly relevant: they observe people will avoid a costless test for herpesa disease for which there is currently no cure, but for which information is useful in that it helps adjust behavior. People have also been found to willfully ignore health risk information, such as calories in food (Thunstr\u00f6m et al., 2016; Woolley & Risen, 2018; Sunstein, 2019; Thunstr\u00f6m, 2019; Nordstr\u00f6m et al., 2020) . Willful ignorance of health outcomes is likely to arise when people are torn between what they think they should do and what they want to do (Thunstr\u00f6m, 2016; Woolley & Risen, 2018) , or when ignorance allows them to form optimal expectations (downplay the probability of a bad health outcome; Oster et al., 2013; Nordstr\u00f6m et al., 2020) . For instance, a person may think she should eat healthy, but want to indulge in ice-cream-she might then choose to avoid learning about the exact amount of calories in the ice-cream in order to avoid either her inner pressure to reduce the ice-cream consumption or the guilt from consuming it despite being aware of the calorie content.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 271, "text": "(Stigler, 1961)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 451, "end": 476, "text": "(Sharot & Sunstein, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 558, "end": 581, "text": "(Thompson et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 604, "end": 628, "text": "(Cutler & Hodgson, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 635, "end": 657, "text": "(Hightow et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 683, "end": 703, "text": "(Oster et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 719, "end": 744, "text": "Ganguly and Tasoff (2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1068, "text": "(Thunstr\u00f6m et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1091, "text": "Woolley & Risen, 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1107, "text": "Sunstein, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1124, "text": "Thunstr\u00f6m, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1148, "text": "Nordstr\u00f6m et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1309, "text": "(Thunstr\u00f6m, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1310, "end": 1332, "text": "Woolley & Risen, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1464, "text": "Oster et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1488, "text": "Nordstr\u00f6m et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this paper, we explore self-selection in COVID-19 testing in the USA. We examine if people willfully avoid getting tested for COVID-19, and, if so, what individual or household characteristics and circumstances are associated with testing avoidance. Given that random voluntary testing is not yet available in the USA, there are no observational data to rely on for our analysis. We therefore design a hypothetical randomized controlled trial (RCT). We recruit a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants. The study entails two treatments, across which we vary information about the potential emotional cost of testing before asking if participants would agree or disagree to a financially costless COVID-19 test. In the baseline treatment, we inform participants that if they are found to be infected, they are urged to self-isolate at home for 14 days. In the high-cost treatment, we tell participants that those who test positive are strongly urged to self-isolate, which may be in a self-quarantine site away from home.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We assume the test itself is costless and that the only cost incurred from a COVID-19 test is the recommended self-isolation for 14 days should the test come back positive.

In contrast, if people are concerned only with social benefits and costs, we would expect those most at risk of exposing others to be the most likely to get tested (e.g., potential 'super-spreaders'; i.e., people with jobs that entail mixing with other people, people living in urban areas, young people and people who are extroverts and attach a high value to social interactions).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "People with the potential to be super-spreaders might be torn about learning whether they are infected by COVID-19. Both private costs and social benefits from being urged to self-isolate for the next 14 days (Harvard Medical School, 2020) might be high for this group, and so influence their testing decision in opposite directions. For example, consider the behavior of an extrovert who values social interactions highly. If unsure of being infected, the extrovert behaves just as if she is not infected (e.g., as found for Huntington's disease, by Oster et al., 2013) . Self-isolation means this person needs to give up highly valued social interactionsa factor that might deter them from a voluntary test for COVID-19. At the same time, their self-isolation provides particularly meaningful private and social health benefits from reduction in exposure to, and spread of, the disease. These benefits to learning whether they are infected might encourage them to voluntarily test. It is an open question if the benefits outweigh the costs, causing the extrovert to take a costless COVID-19 test. Similarly, imagine a store clerk who risks losing income if self-isolating for 14 days. The potential private loss of income would deter them from testing, while the social benefits from reducing disease spread would encourage taking the test. Again, the decision to test becomes an open question. Previous studies show that willful ignorance arises when prosocial behavior is privately costly (Dana et al., 2007; Conrads & Irlenbusch, 2013; Onwezen & van der Weele, 2016; Gigerenzer & Garcia-Retamero, 2017; Grossman & van der Weele, 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 551, "end": 570, "text": "Oster et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1493, "end": 1512, "text": "(Dana et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1513, "end": 1540, "text": "Conrads & Irlenbusch, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1571, "text": "Onwezen & van der Weele, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1607, "text": "Gigerenzer & Garcia-Retamero, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1608, "end": 1639, "text": "Grossman & van der Weele, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, we find that around 70% of people want to take a costless COVID-19 test.

Extroverts might also be at the highest risk for being infected, but even when we control for personal risks (amount of social interactions and worry about own health), we find they are more willing to test. The ability to afford to self-isolate for 14 days does not seem to affect the willingness to test.

Not only is the treatment effect small, it is also of the unexpected signthe share of people willing to test if self-isolation would happen at home is smaller (67%) than the share of people willing to test if self-isolation might happen at a facility away from home (71%). If anything, people might be slightly more inclined to test if a positive result could lead to isolation away from home (potentially due to this also signaling the greater severity of the COVID-19 situation), but the size of the effect is too small for us to detect with our sample size. We have ruled out 3 Participants who stated that they would prefer not to take the test (278/897) were asked for their reasons not to want to take the test. They were given the following alternatives and were asked to mark all that apply: \"I would not change my behavior if I learned I had the virus\" (11%); \"I do not want to self-isolate for 14 days\" (4%); \"My job prevents me from self-isolating for 14 days\" (6%); \"I think I have already had the virus\" (2%); \"It would cause me emotional discomfort if I knew I had the virus\" (7%); \"It doesn't matter to me if I get tested or not\" (30%); other (53%). The numbers in parentheses show the shares of participants who agreed with the statement. As shown, a large share of participants stated that the test would not matter, and that they would not change their behavior anyway. A potential reason for the prominence of these reasons could be that they are already highly complying with social distancing. (Table 3 shows that the more people comply with social distancing, the less likely they are to want to take a COVID-19 test.) However, a large share also states 'other', suggesting that the alternatives presented to our participants did not cover the full range of reasons as to why people may refrain from testing. We encourage future research to further explore these reasons. that this absence of identifiable average effect masks any potentially 'rational' heterogeneity in the population (i.e., we have explored whether there exists a treatment effect for subgroups of the population, such as those with children, higher-quality homes (as measured by income) or health anxiety (as measured by underlying health conditions)).

We do not find that people with children who have underlying health conditions are more likely to take the test, perhaps due to the expectation that people of young age are less affected.

It could be that extroverts are more willing than expected to take a COVID-19 test because their private cost of doing so is unusually low due to the broadly implemented social distancing at the time of data collection for this study. If extroverts are already relatively isolated (i.e., due to a stay-athome order and mandated closures by the state governor of public spaces, such as gyms, restaurants and bars), the personal cost of testing might be low. Furthermore, extroverts might be more likely to get infected if they socialize more, which could be a 'selfish' motivation to get tested. However, we control for the current level of compliance with social distancing, which should address both of these private motivations for increased probability of testing, and we find that people who comply more are less motivated to take the test. We also control for their worry about own health due to COVID-19. Even so, the positive effect on willingness to test from being an extrovert persists. We therefore conclude that the positive effect of being an extrovert on willingness to test for COVID-19 is likely due to social health benefits weighing more heavily in their decision than their private costs from potential self-isolation for 14 days, should the test come back positive. The importance of the prosocial motive in determining COVID-19 testing is consistent with the results of the study by Jordan et al.
