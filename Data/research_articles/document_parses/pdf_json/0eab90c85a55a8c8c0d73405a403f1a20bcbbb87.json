In search for key targets of effective therapeutics, robust animal models mimicking COVID-19 in humans are urgently needed. Here, we show that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of mice is limited and restricted by early type I interferon responses. In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 and develop bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. Moreover, we identify an exuberant innate immune response as a key player in pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a dual role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other. Finally, we assess SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro-CT alike used in clinical practice. Our results reveal the importance of STAT2-dependent interferon responses in the pathogenesis and virus control during SARS-CoV-2 infection and may help rationalizing new strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.",

We used an original patient isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020) that was passaged on HuH7 and Vero E6 cells for these studies ( Fig. S1 and Fig. S2A ). For full characterization and to exclude possible contaminants, we performed deep sequencing on the inoculum that was used to infect the animals (Fig. S2A) . No adventitious agents could be detected (data not shown). However, two in-frame deletions in the N-terminal domain and the furin-cleavage site of Spike (S) glycoprotein (9aa and 5aa, respectively) had occurred between cell culture passage P4 (mixed population of 85% WT genomes and 15% (9+5aa del) mutant genomes) and P6 (100% (9+5aa del) mutant genomes) [9] [10] [11] , likely as adaptation to growth in Vero E6 cells in vitro (Fig. S2B ).",

Of note, these receptor knockouts did not affect ACE2 expression in hamster lungs (Fig. S9A ), while interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) 27 such as MX-2 (strongly induced by IFN\u03b1/STAT2 signaling) and IP-10 (induced by both type I and type II IFNs) showed a differential expression pattern when comparing the different genotypes, triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. S9B) . Importantly, lower baseline expression of MX-2 and IP-10 and failure to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection by MX-2 upregulation in STAT2 -/hamsters confirmed the functional knockout. As expected, IL28R-a -/hamsters showed an intermediate phenotype between that of WT and STAT2 -/concerning their antiviral response. For many respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1, type I and III interferon signaling has been described to play an important role in restricting infection 28 . No marked differences were observed in viral RNA levels in the lung of WT, STAT2 -/or IL28R-a -/hamsters (Fig. 2B) . However, STAT2 -/hamsters had higher titers of infectious virus in the lung (Fig. 2C ), high titer viremia (measured by RT-qPCR and virus titration) 29 and Fig. S8C ). Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 levels, which may serve as a sensitive marker for the infiltration and activation of neutrophils in inflamed tissues 31, 32 , were markedly elevated in the lungs of all infected hamsters (Fig. 2G) . However, higher MMP-9 levels were found in STAT2 -/animals, thereby inversely correlating with the histological findings (Fig. 2D ). In addition, biomarkers elevated in critically ill COVID-19 patients 2,7,33 such as the cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-\uf067 were not found to be elevated in the serum of infected hamsters (Fig. S10B) , although mRNA levels of IP-10 (CXL- 10) were upregulated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters as reported for other cytokine/chemokines downstream of IFN-\uf067 23 (Fig. S9B) . Nonetheless, infected STAT2 -/and IL28R-a -/had clearly increased levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in their lungs (Fig. S10A ). Such an inverse correlation between biomarkers and pathology in WT versus STAT2 -/hamsters is in line with findings in mouse models of SARS-CoV-1 infection in which pathology correlated with the induction and dysregulation of alternatively activated \"wound-healing\" monocytes/macrophages 4,6 . To assess the utility of the hamsters for testing the effect of therapeutic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 replication, WT hamsters were treated with human convalescent plasma or a neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2specific single-domain antibody Fc fusion construct (VHH-72-Fc) 34 prior to infection (Fig. 2H) .",

As primary outcome parameter, a semi-quantitative scoring of micro-CT data was performed as previously described 38, 39, 72 with minor modifications towards optimization for COVID-19 lung disease in hamsters. In brief, visual observations were scored (from 0 -2 depending on severity, both for parenchymal and airway disease) on 5 different, predefined transversal tomographic sections throughout the entire lung image for both lung and airway disease by two independent observers (L.S. and G.V.V.) and averaged. Scores for the 5 sections were summed up to obtain a score from 0 to 10 reflecting severity of lung and airway abnormalities compared to scans of healthy, WT control hamsters. As secondary measures, image-derived biomarkers (nonaerated lung volume, aerated lung volume, total lung volume, the respective densities within these volumes and large airways volume) were quantified as in 38, 72 for a manually delineated VOI in the lung, avoiding the heart and main blood vessels. The threshold used to separate the airways and aerated (grey value 0-55) from non-aerated lung volume (grey value 56-255) was set manually on an 8-bit greyscale histogram and kept constant for all data sets.

Interestingly, only for the P4 virus and not the P6 virus, infectious virus could be observed in the blood. Together, these data suggest STAT2 is critical for restricting SARS-CoV-2 systemic spread and suppressing viral replication outside of the lung compartment. A similar effect was also observed in human Calu-3 cells where pharmacological inhibition of STAT signaling by Ruxolitinib could rescue virus replication from the inhibitory activity of type I IFN (Fig. S9D), further underscoring the role of STAT2 in controlling virus replication. Inversely, the observed lung pathology was much attenuated in STAT2 -/hamsters [MCS=3; IQR=1.5-3 (P4 virus)] with a limited infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes correlated with the detection of few apoptotic bodies in the bronchus walls (Fig. 2D and Fig. S8C). On the contrary, IL28R-a -/hamsters showed clear signs of bronchopneumonia and peribronchiolar inflammation, yet of an intermediate score [MCS=7; IQR=6.5-7 (P4 virus)] (Fig. 2D",

In the upper airways, no differences were observed between WT and STAT2 -/hamsters, whereas IL28R-a -/hamsters presented with an obvious dilation of bronchi (Fig. 3A and 3C). Further quantitative analysis39 revealed an increase of the non-aerated lung volume in SARS-CoV-2-infected WT and IL28R-a -/hamsters, yet again not in STAT2 -/hamsters(Fig. 3D, Fig. S11B). Hence apart from lung consolidations and airway dilation as the main observed pathology, marked differences in other micro-CT-derived markers of specific lung pathology, such as hyperinflation, emphysema, or atelectasis39,40 were not be observed, except in one animal that presented with hyperinflation (Fig. S11CandFig. S12A-C). A matched comparison of the micro-CT-derived lung scores and viral loads in the lungs showed that, in line with our previous results, type I IFN responses downstream of STAT2 signaling drive lung pathology, yet has minor impact on viral replication in the lungs(Fig. 3E). Together, these data fully support micro-CT as a convenient adjunct to histological scoring (Fig. 2DandFig. S11D) to visualize and quantify SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury in the hamster model. Moreover, it may allow to monitor the impact of therapeutic measures non-invasively during disease progression.DiscussionThedevelopment of efficient therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 asks for relevant small animal models that mimic the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and that provide fundamental mechanistic insight into the underlying pathology/pathogenesis. Transgenic mice expressing hACE2, the bona fide receptor of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 41 , have been suggested as COVID-19 model. We here demonstrate that WT mice are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet resulting in very limited viral replication and inflammatory responses. Ablation of type I interferon signaling in Ifnar -/mice results in the same small incremental 10-fold increase in viral replication as was reported for SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice 41,42 . Most likely, neither mouse model will fully recapitulate pathogenesis of COVID-19, nor allow the study of clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates. It remains of interest to investigate the added effect of both hACE2 knock-in and IFNAR knockout in mice. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathology in hamsters seems to resemble what has been reported for SARS-CoV-1 in the same model. An early peak of active virus replication was noted in the lungs with viremia and extra-pulmonary spread. This was accompanied by a strong acute inflammatory response 22 (as visualized by histopathology), the levels of which were correlated with those of MMP-9, a clinically relevant biomarker. Furthermore, micro-CT as established in this study may become a key instrument to non-invasively and quantitatively monitor SARS-CoV-2 lung disease. This will allow to conveniently monitor the effect of therapeutic strategies and test the preclinical efficacy of vaccine candidates. Unlike in humans, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-\uf067 levels were not elevated in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. However, the immune response in COVID-19 patients is a dynamic process in which levels of these cytokine fluctuate over the different phases of disease often peaking late 7,43,44 . By contrast, hamsters show a very acute and short-lived infection 23 that may not allow for the development of a similar cytokine storm that characterizes COVID-19 disease progression in humans, considering that in our studies animals were sacrificed as early as day 4 p.i. Nevertheless, the pathological findings in hamsters seem to resemble to a large extent what is observed in humans, including histopathology, infiltration of PMN cells and consolidation as scored by micro-CT. By comparing data obtained from experiments using the P4 and P6 virus stocks, we observed a possible attenuated in vivo fitness of the P6 stock (lower MMP-9 levels and less infectious virus and viral RNA levels in blood) likely as a consequence of adaptation to enhanced growth in Vero cell cultures. This observation is also in line with what others have reported, namely that tissue cultureadaptive mutations similar to those we have observed (Fig. S2) may result in reduced fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in wild-type hamsters (no body weight loss and less severe pathology) 45 . These findings emphasize the possible consequences of using cell culture-adapted virus when studying SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models. By using unique knock-out hamster lines and human Calu-3 cells, we demonstrated that STAT2 plays a critical role in mediating antiviral responses and restricting systemic dissemination of SARS-CoV-2. This is in line with the effect of STAT1 in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-1 infection 46 . However and much in contrast to what is generally observed for viral infections in Stat2 -/mice 47 or STAT2 -/hamsters 26,48,49 , the severe pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 in WT hamsters is not observed in the absence of STAT2. Indeed, pneumonia as assessed by sensitive micro-CT was absent in STAT2 -/hamsters. Considering the negative regulation of IL-6 and other mediators of inflammation by STAT2 47,50 , our hamster model may help to understand the immune pathogenesis of Acute LungInjury (ALI) caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses22,28,51 as well as other respiratory viruses4 . Of note, a meta-analysis of infected human cells revealed a specific SARS-CoV-2-regulated transcriptional footprint for STAT2 that was much stronger than that of any other inflammatory transcription factor 52 .",

STAT2 -/and IL28R-a -/hamsters were generated by CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene targeting. To ablate STAT2 (Gene ID: 101830537) expression, a 1-nt frameshift mutation was introduced in exon 4 resulting in multiple premature stop codons 25 ; to ablate IL28R (IFNLR1; Gene ID: 101833778) expression, a 22-nucleotide deletion was introduced in exon 2 resulting in multiple premature stop codons in the original open reading frame. Animals were housed individually (hamsters) or per 5 (mice) in individually ventilated isolator cages (IsoCage N Biocontainment System, Tecniplast) with access to food and water ad libitum, and cage enrichment (cotton and cardboard play tunnels for mice, wood block for hamsters). Housing conditions and experimental procedures were approved by the ethical committee of KU Leuven (license P015-2020), following institutional guidelines approved by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA). Animals were euthanized by 100\u00b5l (mice) or 500\u00b5l (hamsters) of intraperitoneally administered Dolethal (200mg/ml sodium pentobarbital, V\u00e9toquinol SA). Animals were monitored daily for signs of disease (lethargy, heavy breathing or ruffled fur). Prior to infection, the animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a xylazine (16 mg/kg, XYL-M\u00ae, V.M.D.), ketamine (40 mg/kg, Nimatek, EuroVet) and atropine (0.2 mg/kg, Sterop) solution. Each animal was inoculated intranasally by gently adding 50\u00b5l droplets of virus stock containing 2 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50 (P4 virus) or 2 \u00d7 10 6 TCID50 (P6 virus) in both nostrils.

Infectious virus was isolated by serial passaging on HuH7 and Vero E6 cells (see Fig. S1), with the addition of penicillin/streptomycin, gentamicin and amphotericin B. Virus used for animal experiments was from passages P4 and P6. Prior to inoculation of animals, virus stocks were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma (PlasmoTest, InvivoGen) and other adventitious agents by deep sequencing on a MiSeq platform (Illumina) following an established metagenomics pipeline 64,65 . The infectious content of virus stocks was determined by titration on Vero E6 cells by the Spearman-K\u00e4rber method. All virusrelated work was conducted in the high-containment BSL3+ facilities of the KU Leuven Rega Institute (3CAPS) under licenses AMV 30112018 SBB 219 2018 0892 and AMV 23102017 SBB 219 2017 0589 according to institutional guidelines. Human convalescent serum (HCS) was donated under informed consent (Patient #1). Human convalescent plasma (Patient #2) was obtained from Biobank Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen, registeredunder Belgian law as Biobank BB190034(Fig. S4). Plasma donated by a healthy volunteer sampled prior to emergence of SARS-CoV-2 served as negative control (NC donor).
