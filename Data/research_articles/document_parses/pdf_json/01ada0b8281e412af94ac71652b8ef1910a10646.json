Our hypothesis was that intestinal SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 expression depends on patients' age. We examined duodenal biopsies from 43 healthy human adults. ACE2 gene expression was directly correlated with age (Spearman's r = 0.317, p = 0.039). With each year, duodenal ACE2 expression increased by 0.083 RU. The higher intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression in older patients may impact on their susceptibility to develop intestinal symptoms.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a novel infectious disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was detected in Wuhan, China, causing the serious epidemic COVID-19 (Zhang 2020) . Similar to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that had caused outbreaks from 2002 to 2004, SARS-CoV-2 binds via its spikes to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with high affinity on cell surfaces (Hoffmann 2020; Walls 2020) . This may enable SARS-CoV-2 to spread easily from person to person and make ACE2 a potential target for vaccines and therapies. ACE2 is abundantly present in humans on epithelial cells of the lung (alveolar epithelial type II cells), kidney, heart, blood, and the small intestine (Hamming et al. 2004 ). In small intestinal enterocytes, ACE2 is necessary for the expression of luminal membrane amino acid transporters B 0 AT1 (SLC6A19) and SIT1 (SLC6A20) (Vuille-dit-Bille 2015; Meier 2018; Verrey 2009; Camargo 2009 ). The intestine might therefore be an entry site for SARS-CoV-2, in particular when the protective role of gastric acid is reduced by drugs or surgically. Infection of human might even have started by eating food from the Wuhan market (Zhang 2020 ). The carboxymonopeptidase ACE2-similar to its structural homolog angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE-also acts as an enzyme that belongs to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and whose expression is induced in many tissues by application of RAS-active medications including ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs). The increased ACE2 expression could facilitate infection with SARS-CoV-2. We previously showed in healthy human adults that ACE2 is expressed in the brush border membrane of small intestinal enterocytes, as well as in colonic crypts (Vuille-dit-Bille 2015). ACE2 mRNA expression was almost twice as high in patients treated with ACE-Is, when compared to patients without treatment (Vuille-dit-Bille 2015). More recently we could show that ACE2 protein is also expressed in the brush border membrane of small intestinal enterocytes in human neonates (aged 0-4 days) (Meier 2018) . Small intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression was almost 1.5 times higher in human adults versus neonates (Meier 2018 ).",

            "text": "The small bowel may be an important entry site for SARS-CoV-2, as small intestinal enterocytes highly express ACE2 in the brush border membrane (Vuille-dit-Bille 2015; Camargo 2009). Furthermore, viral mRNA may be detected in rectal swabs (even for a longer time period than in nasopharyngeal swabs) suggesting the possibility of fecal-oral disease transmission Xiao et al. 2020; Holshue 2020) . Reported gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are common and range from nausea and vomiting to diarrhea and abdominal discomfort with more than 10% of patients presenting with diarrhea (Jin 2020; Gu et al. 2020) . Gastrointestinal symptoms seem to be even more pronounced in children (Tian 2020; D'Amico et al. 2020) . The pathophysiology of diarrhea in COVID-19 patients remains unclear, but might be reflective of damage to the gastrointestinal tract and/or altered intestinal permeability resulting in malabsorption and diarrhea. As shown in the present study, small intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression correlates with age in healthy adults. In addition, we could recently show that small intestinal ACE2 mRNA expression in adults was about 1.5 times as high as in newborns, whereas its expression in older children has not been tested (Meier 2018) . ACE2 is known to function as a brush border membrane-bound peptidase, and is required for the expression of amino acid transporters B 0 AT1 (SLC6A19) and SIT1 (SLC6A20) for which it functions as an associated chaperon protein (Vuille-dit-Bille 2015; Camargo 2009 ). It is noteworthy to mention that we have recently shown that the amino acid transporter SIT1 [similar to the fructose transporter GLUT 5 (SLC2A5) (Meier 2019)] is not yet expressed in newborn humans (Meier 2018) , and that the association of ACE2 with amino acid transporters has been suggested to interfere with its proteolytic cleavage and thereby with its ability to support SARS-CoV-2 infection (Yan 2020 ). Thus, differential amino acid transporter expression in children versus adults may impact on the susceptibility to intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, the expression of ACE2 in small intestine may impact on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2-mediated infection and symptoms via its demonstrated effects on intestinal innate immunity and microbiota composition (Hashimoto 2012) . Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that age-dependent changes in intestinal ACE2 expression may impact on the susceptibility to gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms.",
