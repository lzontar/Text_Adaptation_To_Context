Interestingly, the three patients assessed with RHC (#1, #4-5) had significantly elevated troponin levels but preserved cardiac outputs, without arrhythmias, ischemic EKG changes, or histologically appreciable myocarditis ordetectable viral particles, though tissue evaluation is limited by the possibility of sampling bias in this small cohort. Such troponin elevations in the COVID-19 literature have typically heralded significant myocardial injury and worse outcome. 10,24,26 A plausible mechanism for the lack of directly observable myocardial injury may be related to the immunomodulatory protection afforded by the calcineurin inhibitors and other immunosuppression medications administered to transplant recipients. 16 Of the 31 HTx recipients in our program, only five had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and all developed moderate/severe COVID-19 illness. The two patients with severe disease presented in mid-April 2020 and were not included within the recently published Northwell cohort of 5700 COVID-19 patients admitted to acute care between March 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020. 2 Relative to this larger patient population, progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation was more common among F I G U R E 1 Histopathology in Heart Transplant Recipients with COVID-19.

The four COVID-19 HTx patients described in a recent series from Spain also delayed presentation for close to a week, and only two (50%) survived their hospitalizations.19 These findings underscore how insidious progression of SARS-CoV-2 may be of greater concern in immunocompromised individuals thus warranting vigilant outpatient follow-up to facilitate early identification of COVID-19. Onset of flu-like symptoms should raise a high index of clinical suspicion for COVID-19. In such instances, it may be prudent to have a low threshold for confirmatory testing and/or direct physical examination to ensure timely intervention and supportive care.Beyond the characteristic lymphopenia present in the majority of COVID-19 patients, 2,31 the two HTx recipients with severe disease also had profound lymphocytic leukopenia marked by absolute lymphocyte counts (200-270 #/\u00b5L) which were substantially lower than any documented thus far in the literature13,15 and potentially attributable to myelosuppression from MMF and/or valganciclovir. The prognostic significance of lymphopenia is well described, and coupled with other laboratory study derangements portends a higher fatality rate.28 More specifically, both of these patients had advanced to stage III (severe)14 COVID-19 disease with progression to ARDS and marked elevations in CRP, D-dimer, ferritin, and other serum biomarkers indicative of systemic hyperinflammation. Along with a steep rise in procalcitonin, these laboratory abnormalities were most pronounced in Patient #4 and may partially explain why his clinical deterioration was the most precipitous of the study cohort. Given the favorable response reported in other challenging COVID-19 patients at risk of cytokine storm, 32 a single dose of tocilizumab was administered and his surrogate markers of inflammation subsequently decreased over the ensuing days. He remains hospitalized but hemodynamically stable and requires only minimal intermittent ventilatory support. The role of adjunctive antiviral therapy with IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonists, and other anti-inflammatory agents will hopefully become more well defined as published study data and clinical experiences accumulate. Two critical questions regarding HTx and the COVID-19 pandemic are (a) whether immunosuppression places patients at additional risk or perhaps counterintuitively is protective and (b) what are the potential ramifications of continuing to offer transplantation while the virus continues to spread in hospitals and the communities? Results from our cohort and other published studies point toward immunosuppressed patients having similar or worse outcomes likely due to a blunted immune response 17-20,22,23 and would support a very cautious approach to transplantation while the disease is prevalent. The appropriate management of immunosuppression during COVID-19 infection is unknown at this time but was reduced in all of our patients and there was no evidence of significant rejection; this was verified in three patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsies, and by echocardiography all five patients had preserved graft function. HTx during the COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges to the organ procurement team and requires confirmatory negative testing of the donor prior to retrieval. 29 Despite utilizing rigorous contact precautions, at least of one our HTx patients contracted COVID-19 nosocomially. Of the three patients who were infected within 2 months of transplant and were highly immunosuppressed, two had severe illnesses requiring intubation and the other had a milder course and never required supplemental oxygen, highlighting the clinical heterogeneity of this disease. As nosocomial spread is possible and the suggestion that highly immunosuppressed patients may have more severe disease, centers should use caution in pursuing transplantation amidst a pandemic if viable alternatives exist.
