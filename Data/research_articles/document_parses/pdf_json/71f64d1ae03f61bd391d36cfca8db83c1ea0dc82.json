In 2014, Li et al. proposed a novel idea to detect oncogenes on target DNA on 11 a \u00b5PAD in vitro (Li, et al., 2014). They developed a porous Au-paper working electrode (Au-PWE) 12 which combined the porosity of paper and high conductivity of Au-nano-particles. The DNA sensor 13 showed tremendous specificity and also had a Limit-Of-Detection (LOD) as low as 8.5x10 -18 M. 14 Among the many antigens found in blood, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) can be used as 15 oncological biomarkers which is one the most widely used tumor marker in the clinical diagnosis of 16 colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and cervical carcinomas (Wang, et al., 2016). CEA levels directly 17 correspond to the stage of the tumor, the outcome of therapy and the prognosis. In 2016, Wang et 18 al developed a highly sensitive label-free paper-based electrochemical immunosensor employing a 19 screen-printed working electrode (SPWE) which was modified with graphene nanocomposite for 20 detection of CEA (Wang, et al., 2016). It demonstrated high efficiency and high sensitivity to the 21 samples it was tested against. Hence, it could provide a low-cost, sensitive Point-Of-Care diagnosis. 22 However, in 2017, Fan et al demonstrated the detection of Neuron-specific Enolase (NSE), a tumor 23 marker essential for monitoring effect and judging prognosis and diagnosis of small cell lung cancer 24 using a wireless POCT (Point-Of-Care-and-Testing) device comprising of a \u00b5PAD-based measuring 25 system (Fan, et al., 2017). The detection results of NSE were comparable to those measured by a 26 commercial electrochemical workstation. The data generated were hence, transmitted over to the 27 smartphone using Bluetooth and displayed in real-time.

Using this concept, Chen and Dong developed 22 a peel-able \u00b5PAD attached to diaper for elderly patients, in which the urine sample is collected and 23 analyzed (Chen & Dong, 2015). The \u00b5PAD was made of filter paper with patterned wax with varying 24 concentrations of nitrite in eight segregated chemical reagent zones.

These cell-laden scaffolds composed of the paper-plastic composite were placed in an 10 acrylic holder that enabled the exchange of fresh medium with the stack and generate a decreasing 11 gradient of oxygen. This arrangement mimicked the environment of a poorly-vascularized 12 environment of tissues like that of cancerous tumors: top stack was well-oxygenated whereas the 13 bottom stacks were experiencing hypoxic conditions and an increase in expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and 14 CAIX. A similar model was used to study the chemoresistance of colorectal carcinoma cells (Boyce, et 15 al., 2017). Herein, stainless steel holders were used instead of an acrylic frame which ensured the 16 scaffolds were in conformal contact throughout the experiment. In 2018, Wang and his group 17 developed a multi-layer CiGiP to analyze tumor cell migration in 3D cultures (Wang, et al., 2018). To 18 monitor the progression of malignant tumors, the motility of the cells is measured.

Hydrophobic 25 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) ink was used to print patterned structures on paper substrates for the 26 preparation of arrays used for two-dimensional cell culture and a lipophilic staining agent was 27preferred for cell imaging(Juvonen, et al., 2013).

Another challenge was that of amplifying the signals detected 10 using \u00b5PADs.

Moreover, they provided a solution for accomplishing controlled radical 14 polymerization reaction, Activator Generated Electron Transfer for Atom Transfer Radical (AGET 15 ATRP), on a \u00b5PAD. 16 However, \u00b5PADs face other difficulties like complexity of cells migration from loading zone to testing 17 zone (Wu, Chueh-Yu, et al., 2014), lack of proper adhesion sites (Ng, et al., 2019) lack sensitivity to 18 amount of analytes and complexity in integration of functional reagents to substrates (Hu, et al., 19 2016).To tackle the problems different scientist groups proposed different solutions. To tackle the 20 problem of transporting suspensions of discrete objects like cells or microparticles laser 21 micromachined hybrid open/paper microfluidic chips were developed in which the liquid carrier was 22 transported in a Mylar microchannel but driven by a paper channel, with quantitative flow control 23 (Wu, Chueh-Yu, et al., 2014). Then, Ng et al. developed the ES-PCL/FP (Electro-spin-PCL over Filter 24 Paper) which showed incredible cell adhesion of human-Foetal-Osteoblastic cells (hFOB). Lack of 25 sensitivity was tackled by concentrating targets from a larger volume by speeding up intrinsic 26 thermodynamic partitioning in aqueous two-phase systems (Wu, Chueh-Yu, et al., 2014).
