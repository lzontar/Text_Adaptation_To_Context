For example, in top-down machining operations such as cutting or grinding, the contact between the tool and workpiece in presence of lubricant controls the process dynamics and thus affects the surface finish, tool wear and surface integrity [1, 2] . During machining, continuous physical and chemical interactions between the mating surfaces and lubricant result in the evolution of texture at the machining interface along with the formation of lubricant film (also known as tribofilm). The valuable role of tribofilm formation in grinding and other processes has been previously reported for nano-engineered lubricants (NL) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Specifically, in grinding, one of the authors reported the useful role of interaction between the lubricant and the texture of the grinding wheel [2] .

            "text": "Hardened AISI 52100 steel discs and balls (>HRC 60) were used as mating surfaces for tribological experiments. The 52100 steel discs were lapped (using contract lapping services) to achieve a mirror finish (S q -0.05 \u00b5m) and ensure isotropic texture. Lapped discs were used without further processing for all experiments. Non-formulated poly alphaolefin base oil (PAO) and MoS 2 -based nano-engineered lubricant (3% by wt. in base oil) (NL) were used as lubricants for the study. A detailed description of the lubricant preparation and characterization can be found in previous publications [2, [13] [14] [15] . Tribological tests were performed on a pin-on-disc tribometer (CSM instruments) under rotating mode. Pin-ondisc setup was chosen because of its wide use in performing fundamental tribological studies as it allows for effective control of test variables due to robust, open-loop nature. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a pin-on-disc setup where a stationary ball (point contact) is rotated against a disc under the applied normal load. The testing parameters (20 N load, 1 cm/s linear speed) were chosen to simulate boundary lubrication (BL) conditions where the interacting surfaces are in direct contact. This BL regime is commonly encountered during many manufacturing processes and in several machine components where the formation of the tribo-chemical film is crucial for preventing surface damage and part failure [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . To understand the progression of tribo-chemical reactions and lubrication contact mechanics, control tests (using NL as a lubricant) were first conducted to verify the repeatability of the tests and the trends. The results of those control tests are shown in Figure 2 . The tests were stopped at 10,000 laps when the coefficient of friction (COF) stabilized to a steadystate value. As shown in the figure, the COF plot was divided into three distinct regions (indicated by dashed lines), namely 'region 1' (R1, COF increasing and plateauing), 'region 2' (R2, COF decreasing), and 'region 3' (R3, steady-state COF). Time intervals were identified to study the surface and tribofilm properties in the three regions using the control test results shown in Figure 2 . Further tribological tests were conducted for different time intervals identified from the control tests using NL and pure base oil (PAO) as lubricants. These intervals were chosen to represent various stages of texture (and lubrication) evolution as depicted by solid black vertical lines in Figure 2 . The time intervals those for chosen for further testing were 1000 and 2000 laps in region 1, 4000 and 5000 laps in region 2 and 7000 laps in region 3. Three tests were conducted at each time interval and representative samples were chosen for characterization. After each test, the excess oil was cleaned using hexane solvent before wear track analysis. It should be noted that the non-formulated base oil is unable to form chemically reacted tribofilm under BL and thus serves are a comparative reference for determining the ability of NL to form a tribo-chemical film over time. Even though the effect of various nano-additives has been well documented in the literature [21] [22] [23] , the correlation between the evolution of surface texture and the role of the evolving texture on governing the tribo-chemical reactions has not been studied.",

            "text": "Results of the tribological tests and the surface/tribofilm characterization are discussed below in the context of the three stages of lubrication (R1, R2, and R3) and process mechanism. Figure 3 depicts the variation in RMS areal surface roughness (S q ) over time for nano-engineered lubricant (NL) and base oil (PAO) through the three stages of lubrication. As seen from the figure, surface roughness for PAO is higher (2-3 times) than NL. The very high S q value for the 4000 laps PAO samples was attributed to the presence of deep grooves on one of the tested samples. Overall, it was noted that pure base oil failed to protect the surface (without the surface protective tribofilm) and led to deeper grooves due to direct asperity-to-asperity contact. The increase in the surface roughness was attributed to the formation and fracture of work-hardened surface asperities and the resultant wear debris (supported by the SEM micrographs shown in Figure 6) . Surprisingly, S q for NL also increased in region 1 (R1). This was attributed to the fact that at the onset of the test, lubrication was dominated by direct asperity-to-asperity contact and physisorbed lubricant before the initiation of continuous tribofilm formation and stabilization. As a result, COF increased slightly (see Figure 9 ) and surface asperities (along with the lubricant material flow) were progressively aligned in the direction of motion. This alignment of texture asperities in the direction of motion when operating new mechanical systems is commonly understood as the 'break-in' or 'running-in' phenomenon [25, 26] . Similarly, in machining, the interaction between the tool and the workpiece results in the reorganization of the texture asperities. The texture is composed of asperities, and these freshly exposed unpassivated high-energy asperities are ready for tribochemical reactions to reduce surface energy. Previous reports have shown the effect of contact pressure on tribofilm activation and build-up on a single asperity studied using AFM [27] . The energy dissipated at the interface of mating asperities during this stage initiates the thermo-mechanical activation of tribo-chemical reactions. In region 2 (R2), as the tribo-chemical reactions at texture asperities continue, tribofilm is formed and further developed in terms of its coverage and thickness, before stabilizing into steady-state in region 3 (R3) where the creation of fresh asperities and tribochemical reactions are balanced. As a result of tribofilm activation, improving tribofilm coverage and subsequent stabilization, S q dropped down slightly in R2 before reaching steady-state values in R3. In R3, the lubrication contact mechanics is increasingly dominated by the continuous tribofilm developed across asperities and the valleys between those asperities. The variation between the measurements (denoted by error bars) also lowered for NL as compared to the PAO case. This further indicates that the NL leads to more predictable and controlled behavior in machining [2] as compared to PAO due to the formation of tribofilm on oriented texture asperities. Figure 4 shows the evolution of arithmetic mean peak curvature (S pc ) over time for NL and PAO. The mean peak curvature values indicate the sharpness of peaks in the measurement area (higher S pc values indicate sharper peaks). As seen in Figure 4 , the S pc values increased during the breakin period (region 1) for both NL and PAO with PAO showing a more overall increase from the virgin polished disc values. This was attributed to the asperity-to-asperity contact at the start of the test which results in the re-alignment and breaking in of the texture asperities resulting in sharp peaks. During the contact, such sharp peaks resulted in high local contact pressures and temperatures and thus in the case of NL, caused the onset of tribo-chemical reactions. This resulted in a significant reduction of S pc values in region 2 as the protective tribofilm formed over the asperities. Over time, as the tribochemical reactions progressed and tribofilm stabilized in region 3, low S pc values were maintained. This indicated that the texture asperities were protected by the tribofilm leading to more rounded peaks in the contact area. On the other hand, continuous interaction between the mating surface asperities led to an increase in the sharpness of peaks for PAO. This observation is consistent with the increase in surface roughness ( Figure 3 ) discussed above. The increase in the peak sharpness was attributed to the formation and fracture of work-hardened surface asperities and debris without the surface protective tribofilm and is confirmed by the SEM micrographs ( Figure 6 ). Figure 5 shows the variation in the density of peaks (S pd ) within the wear track area. The virgin polished discs had a large number of isotropic asperities. In region 1, as the original asperities were broken-in, the peak densities reduced for both NL and PAO. This was due to texture re-formation from the closely spaced asperities to wide-spaced directional asperities. Peak density remained stable in regions 2 and 3 for NL, indicating effective asperity protection and the favorable role of NL in governing the texture and tribofilm evolution. The tribofilm helped avoid direct asperity-to-asperity contact and thus prevented further reductions of peak density. On the contrary, lower S pd values for PAO indicated the severity of surface wear as a larger number of asperities were in direct contact, resulting in severe wear due to the lack of tribofilm. Consistent with previous discussions, the wear in the case of PAO led to the formation of deeper and wider grooves along the wear track due to severe plastic deformation of the asperities. Similar to the above observations, the formation of tribofilm resulted in a more predictable trend and less sampleto-sample variation for NL in comparison to PAO. The evolving texture is fundamental to the machining operations and mechanical components (during 'break-in') as a result of contact between mating surfaces. The above results and trends in the variation of surface texture parameters indicate how evolving texture asperities govern the dynamics of tribo-chemical reactions and tribofilm. The formation of tribofilm in the case of NL protected the texture asperities and prevented further asperity-to-asperity contact. The morphology of the surface was analyzed using SEM to support the above understanding of the process mechanism. Figure 6 shows the progression in the morphology of wear track surface and lubricant coverage for the representative samples at 1000 laps (R1), 4000 laps (R2) and 7000 laps (R3) time durations. Consistent with the above discussion, the SEM images for the PAO samples show severe surface wear, re-creation, and the deformation of wear debris at all time intervals. This confirms the failure of base oil to form protective tribofilm and leads to higher surface roughness.",

Similar MoS 2 based tribolofilms were observed during tribological testing simulating grinding using abrasive grinding pins on cast iron workpiece [4] . The presence of directional grooves (formed by re-alignment of texture asperities) in the NL sample was attributed to the break-in period phenomenon in region 1 (R1) as discussed in the previous section. Additionally, the density of lubricant agglomerates decreased progressively from R1 to R3. This indicates the progression of tribo-chemical reactions from physisorbed film to chemically adhered film over time. It was concluded that asperity-to-asperity contact and the physisorbed lubricant dominated the lubrication initially in R1 (1000 laps). As time progressed, with the onset of tribochemical reactions between the texture asperities and the lubricant particles, the density of the physisorbed lubricant particles on the wear track reduced (7000 laps). Consequently, the surface texture parameter values (Figures 3-5) in regions R2 and R3 stabilized to a steady-state as the tribofilm prevented further asperity-to-asperity contact. The chemical evolution of tribofilm in correlation with the surface texture and surface morphology was further studied using Raman and TEM techniques. The findings are presented below.",

            "text": "The Raman spectra from representative samples from the three stages of lubrication are shown in Figure 7 . As depicted in the figure, the intensity and clear definition of the Raman peaks progressively increases with time, suggesting an increasing tribofilm coverage consistent with the SEM results presented above. The tribofilm is composed of MoS 2 based chemistry as identified by the presence of primary peaks corresponding to in-plane vibrations of S-Mo-S (E 1 2g mode at 386 cm -1 ) and out of plane vibrations (A 1g mode at 407 cm -1 ) [28] . Apart from the primary peaks, other peaks corresponding to MoS 2 tribofilm were identified and are consistent with the reported values in the literature [13, 29] . In addition to these peaks corresponding to MoS 2 chemistry, other peaks corresponding to the products of tribo-chemical reactions also emerged over time, especially in R3 steadystate region. These peaks were identified to be of Fe 2 O 3 (224 cm -1 ), FeS 2 (361 cm -1 ) [30] and FeMoO 4 (925 cm -1 ) [31] . These compounds were formed because of reactions between the ferrous substrate and MoS 2 lubricant particles under the applied load between mating textures of surfaces. The MoS 2 nanoparticles are capped with long-chain fatty acids as a result of chemo-mechanical processing using canola oil as a milling medium [14, 15] . The polar heads of the hydrocarbon chains help the anchoring and adsorption of nanoparticles on the freshly formed high energy asperities in the texture during the break-in stage (R1) where lubrication is dominated by the physisorbed lubricant. Under the applied load and harsh BL conditions, these adsorbed MoS 2 nanoparticles are sheared and exfoliated (studied by TEM images and shown below) where they align and re-align themselves with the texture contours. The sulfur atoms from the exfoliated MoS 2 layers react with the freshly exposed texture asperities, resulting in iron sulfide phase identified above. Additionally, the reaction between the steel substrate, oxygen, and Mo results in the formation of a complex FeMoO 4 compound. This peak at 925 cm -1 becomes more prominent between the development stage (R2) and the steady-state stage (R3), thus confirming the progression of chemical reactions and the resulting stabilization of chemical texture over physical texture. Overall, the peaks corresponding to different lubricious compounds become 'well-defined' with time demonstrating stabilization by the formation of well-developed crystalline phases. These interpretations are consistent with the physical texture data presented earlier. At the onset of the test, lubrication was dominated by physisorbed lubricant particles in region 1. During this stage, the anchored lamellar lubricant layers are sheared, aligned and layered along with the substrate as depicted in Figure 8 (a). These lamellar layers of 10-15 nm thickness did not show any exfoliation of atomic MoS 2 layers. As the test progressed into region 2 (4000 laps), the thickness of the adhered lubricant layer increased to 15-25 nm (Figure 8 (b) ), and at the same time, some degree of intermixing and exfoliation was observed. During this stage, the aligned lubricant layers start to exfoliate and react with the surface asperities to form a surface protective film. Over time, at 7000 laps, the thickness of adhered lubricant layers increased as shown in Figure 8 (c) with the progression of tribo-chemical reactions and mating interaction between the surfaces. Also, the extent of lubricant layers exfoliation and the atomic intermixing of lamellar layers increased with time, indicating the dynamic nature of the chemical texture synthesis process and the progressive delivery of lamellar tribo-layers. Figure 8 (c) also shows a representative example of a sheared lubricant nanoparticle with lamellar layers aligned with the asperity orientation along with an unsheared lubricant nanoparticle. This captures the dynamic nature of the tribological events at the asperities, representative of the dynamic nature of the interaction between tool and a workpiece or mating mechanical component such as piston-piston liner during operation. The interaction of asperities and lubricant particles manifests into the formation of surface protective tribofilm. The increase in thickness as well as the exfoliation, intermixing and delivery of the tribo-layers from 1000 laps to 7000 laps is consistent with the Raman measurements and the stabilization of chemical and physical texture morphology.",

            "text": "The progression in COF at 7000 laps (R3) is shown in Figure 9 as it represents the cumulative result of evolving physical and chemical textures with the emphasis on interpreting and comparing the overall trends observed. It is clear from the COF plots that NL provided better protection of texture asperities as indicated by lower COF values consistent with previous reports [2, 13] . Additionally, the frictional response for NL showed less noise and less sampleto-sample variation (more predictable behavior) as the interaction between the two mating surfaces and their textures is modulated by the formation and stabilization of the tribofilm chemistry, synergistic with the evolution of texture. Whereas, without the tribofilm, stochastic direct contact between the mating texture asperities results in high COF values in the case of PAO. Also, higher flash temperatures (due to direct asperity-to-asperity contact) under BL likely result in the failure/decomposition of oil resulting in lubrication starvation [32] and the generation of workhardened wear debris ( Figure 6 ) via adhesive and abrasive wear. When trapped in the contact region, these harder, strainhardened wear particles resulted in progressive wear and the noise observed in COF plots due to aggressive asperities as a part of the resulting texture. Similar results were observed for the trend in wear scar diameter (WSD) measured on the counter surface (steel ball) as shown in Figure 10 . As expected, the WSD increased with time for both non-formulated base oil and NL. However, consistent with the observed COF data and the SEM study, the NL showed better performance on controlling the wear owing to the surface protective tribofilm. Furthermore, the incremental increase in the values from R1 to R3 follows the tribofilm formation and its evolution to the steady-state. From the above results, the following lubrication process mechanism is presented: in region 1, under BL, direct asperity-to-asperity contact causes the breaking-in of the initial sharp texture asperities and results in increased COF and surface roughness values. Physisorption and alignment of lubricant particles along with the texture, directional reorganization of texture asperities, and energy dissipation at the contact during the breaking-in process triggered the onset of tribo-chemical reactions and tribofilm formation as the physisorbed film starts changing into a chemically reacted film. This process manifests into the reduction in COF in region 2 as the texture asperities are being coated with the low friction lamellar lubricant tribo-layers. Over time, the progression of tribo-chemical reactions through continuous shearing, exfoliation, and delivery of lubricant layers on texture asperities results in increased tribofilm coverage in region 3. The continuous tribofilm controls the tribological contact in this stage resulting in a more predictable and controlled steady-state frictional response with stable COF values. These findings provide further insight when designing and understanding tribological surfaces for machining and manufacturing operations of mating mechanical parts.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the progressive evolution of physical and chemical textures is observed in three distinct regions as mechanical interaction progressed. The evolution of these textures controls the dynamics of lubricant film formation and evolution. Asperities compose these textures and high-energy, freshly formed asperities are believed to facilitate the formation of chemically reacted tribofilms, making the transition from a physical-texture-dominated interface to more chemical-texture-dominated interface in terms of their role. This transition is responsible for reducing noise and magnitude for COF and wear. At the same time, this delivered a controlled and predictable behavior over time. Asperities and the open spaces (cavities) among them form a network of terrain for the active supply and storage of lubricants as texture evolves during the course of progression across three regions. The findings of this research will be beneficial in designing and understanding the role of directional surface texture for various mechanical applications as well as in controlling surface finish and integrity in machining and other manufacturing processes through effective lubrication.",
