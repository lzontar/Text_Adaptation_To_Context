The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 \u2103), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = -0.0100, 95% CI: -0.0125, -0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.

When we stratified the four curves by disease state, the patterns were similar: the population size increased early in the epidemic and then decreased as the period ended (due to recovery). The M-SEIR model predicted that the number of infections in Wuhan would peak on about Mar 5 (inflection point) and the outbreak would end by late April(Figure 4B; Supplemental Video 1). A sensitivity analysis of the transmission rate that adjusted for temperature indicated high stability of our M-SEIR model(Figure 4C; Supplemental Video 2).

Dynamic transmission models are usually used to predict the genesis and spread of infectious diseases and to evaluate the effects of interventions. However, few dynamic transmission models have considered environmental factors, and this could increase the uncertainty of their results. To better characterize the dynamics of an infectious disease, it is better to consider the impact of environmental factors within a dynamic transmission model(Bakker et al., 2016;Martinez et al., 2016).Environmental factors, along with lag effects and threshold effects, can affect the host and virus during the outbreak of an infectious disease. On one hand, environmental factors affect human activity patterns and immunity. We found that environmental conditions had a limited effect on the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the absence of extreme weather conditions during our limited study period and the lack ofspecific immunity to this new virus. On the other hand, environmental factors have a greater impact on the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) than the host population because the transmission and virulence of this virus varies in different conditions. Finally, our results indicated that the impact of environmental factors on virus transmission should be characterized using a dynamic model, because infectiousness estimated from a traditional model is biased by confounding from environmental variables.It is necessary to consider environmental variables in a dynamic transmission model so that their impact can be isolated and quantified. A dynamic model is compatible with an infectious disease transmission model for the virus itself, and can also be coupled with surveillance data of environmental variables(Pitzer et al., 2015).",
