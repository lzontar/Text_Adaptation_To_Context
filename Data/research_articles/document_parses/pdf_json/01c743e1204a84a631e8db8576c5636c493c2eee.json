(1) Patients had a severe end stage dilated cardiomyopathy (mean Left ventricular end diastolic diameter 8 \u00b1 2,2 cm) and markedly impaired ventricular function (mean LVEF 25 \u00b1 3.8 %)(1). It is not clear if they had been hospitalized for manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection or for other causes, as the symptoms described were fatigue and mild cough, common to both respiratory infection and heart failure.",

As reference literature, the authors cite two papers showing epidemiological features and clinical aspects of COVID-19 patients not focused on cardiac involvement (1). Other reports, including 416 and 144 patients respectively and focused on acute cardiac injury (demonstrating a relationship between the elevated cTn, up to 28-fold increase of normal values and an adverse outcome), were not considered (2, 3) Although the authors claim having provided \"a stronger evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19\", a direct link between the cardiac injury and COVID-19 appears rather uncertain in the population described (1). Patients with long-lasting heart failure and severely compromised functional status are burdened by high mortality in the course of any infection, even in the absence of a direct viral damage. COVID-19 may have contributed to heart failure worsening to some extent, even if the reported chest CT scan and the maintenance of spontaneous respiration do suggest a mild infection form. Finally, the lack of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data (with the exception of left ventricular ejection fraction), and even more of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data, necessary to characterize myocardial tissue structure and function, greatly limit the informative contribution of this paper. Additionally, the specific causes of death were not specified by the authors. ",
