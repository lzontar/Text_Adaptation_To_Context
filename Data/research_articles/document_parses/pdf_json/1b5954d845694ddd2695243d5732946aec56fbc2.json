[26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In one infant study, IL-17A and IL-23 levels were associated with a reduction in clinical symptoms of respiratory distress. 31 Lower levels of IL-17 cytokines in patients with RSV in our study might have contributed to an inability to properly control the host inflammatory response leading to a more serious disease pattern and sicker patients with RSV that were hospitalized longer. Sampling from other sites, for example nasal sampling or BAL (in severe cases), would assist in better understanding the difference/ synergy between local compared with systemic cytokine effects. In addition, although we carefully recorded and analyzed data on variables potentially adversely affecting an effective immune response we could not account for residual confounding in this study. We can only hypothesize about the mechanism behind the difference in the cytokine profile observed between influenza A and B in our effort. Influenza B infection remains less studied than influenza A both in humans and animals despite the fact that it is associated with a significant number of respiratory infection cases during winter. 32 Contrary to our findings, in a study of 72 patients comparing cytokine levels in type A vs type B influenza, IL-17A (the hallmark cytokine of the TH17 cell subset) along with IL-6 levels were significantly higher in type B influenza. 33 A less virulent circulating B strain could explain our findings. In an animal study that used an immunosuppressed-mouse model of influenza B infection and a cytokine panel that included IL-17, there was no evidence of an important contribution of Th17 in the pathogenicity. 34 Moreover different degrees of immunopathology was caused by two different influenza B viruses; the Victoria lineage virus was more virulent and was associated with greater morbidity and 100% lethality in these experiments. 34 Interestingly, during the period of our study the main influenza B strain across Europe and in Greece belonged to the Yamagata lineage. 35 Due to the small sample of this study, this F I G U R E 1 Continued ANTALIS ET AL.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 113, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 114, "end": 118, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 119, "end": 123, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 129, "end": 133, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 258, "end": 260, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1252, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1487, "end": 1489, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1764, "end": 1766, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 1992, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2129, "end": 2131, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| 967"}, {"text": "| 969 difference will have to be verified in other studies that would specifically examine different lineages of the virus.
