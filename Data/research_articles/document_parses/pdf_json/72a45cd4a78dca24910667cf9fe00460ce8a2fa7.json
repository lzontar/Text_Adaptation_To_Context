Federation allows Prometheus to have a heritage of some targets monitored from another Prometheus. The main idea for using Federation is to have a decentralised system in order to monitor the Wi-Fi RAN metrics through another Prometheus for other tasks. The alerts raised are picked by the Alert Mitigation Module (AMM), which is part of the Management Monitoring Gateway. The purpose of AMM is to manage the configuration of the architectural components responsible of the behavior of the E2E slice. To that aim, AMM contains the mitigation logic based on a ponderation of the rules defined in the Rulebook. When an alert is triggered, AMM differences between different severity levels. If the severity is critical, the mitigation module must mitigate the alert with higher priority without considering further alerts following the configuration defined in the Rulebook. For warning severities, the Mitigation module saves the alert in a time window, which is configured by the Rulebook (Fig. 4) . The window (or queue), groups the alerts by the specific mitigation required by it. Every warning alert has a ponderation in the Rulebook. The warning alert is added in the queue with its correspondent ponderation. If the sum of the ponderations in the mitigation queue exceeds the mitigation ponderation, configured in the Rulebook, a mitigation action composed with all the warning severity alerts is triggered, emptying the mitigation queue and silencing the alert.",

By means of these modifications, the Local Scheduler is able to manage the MAC-scheduler which controls the airtime or channel time assigned to each slice (which is then fairly distributed among all the user terminals of each slice).

The information collected from the MCPTT service includes the number of registered and active users, the number of private calls, group calls, private emergency calls, group emergency calls that have been started/ongoing/terminated and the number of users involved in each of the calls. Finally, the system collects information from RACOON about the number of users per slice per cell, transmitted bit rate and quality of the signal. For each identified metric, the measurement framework and the alarms it can trigger is included. Two alarm thresholds are defined. The first alarm threshold provides a warning, whereas the second threshold is considered a critical situation.",

We propose a deployment topology in three main stages. Under normal circumstances, the system instantiates the network slices that correspond to a default service agreement. Here, the first responder only needs a reduced amount of access capacity and communication features for its normal operations. Then, triggered by an emergency incident that is detected through a private emergency call, the first responder requires increased capacity in terms of edge computing resources, in order to serve a higher number of incoming communications and/or public safety users. This implies the scaling of the MCPTT VNF and it may involve a deterioration of the service for legacy users, since their network slice(s) must be reduced in order to appropriately allocate the higher priority MCPTT service. Finally, in the third stage triggered by a group emergency call, the system responds with an expansion of the MCPTT radio slice up to the 75% of the available bandwidth in the cell where the emergency events are happening (detected by the increasing number of users in the cell). Again, this situation may involve an impairment of the service provided to civilians in favor of the communications for first responders, which require higher priority. Figure 7 shows some screenshots that illustrate the operation of the orchestration process. The upper screen shows the monitoring of MCPTT calls during the experiment. It can be observed how the different events are detected over time.",
