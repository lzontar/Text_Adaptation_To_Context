Local application of Ca 2+ chelator 1 ,2-bis(2-aminophenoxi)ethan-N,N,N ,N -tetraacetate (BAPTA-AM) to soleus during unloading allowed us to demonstrate directly dependence of calpain activity on [Ca 2+ ] in vivo [38] . Importantly, techniques for determination of calpain activity used in the works [37] and [38] registered the enzymes activity at high millimolar concentration of calcium in the incubation medium, where higher activity of all calpain molecules was observed. Increase in calpains activity under disuse can be caused by their expression intensification or by other Ca 2+ -independent regulators, as calpastatin. Thus, hindlimb suspension leads to pronounced decrement of calpastatin expression in soleus, while calpain 1 expression increases slightly [39] . Activity of calpains decreased in unloaded muscle under local application of calcium chelator [38] can be evidence of Ca 2+ -dependence of regulation of calpastatin expression. Calpains contribute about 10% to disuse muscle atrophy. Their key role was demonstrated in HS experiments with mice overexpressing calpastatin, in which no reduction of muscle fiber size was observed [21] .

At that UPS, most probably, realizes final protein degradation. Close interrelation between Ca 2+ -dependent proteases and UPS complicates studies of their individual contribution into atrophy development under disuse. Intracellular localization of calpains in association with titin molecule makes possible the interrelation between UPS and calpains. Calcium accumulation under disuse activates calpains, which partly degrade titin molecule or change its conformation [41, 48] . Titin not only is involved in fiber contractility, but also realizes its signaling function through phosphorylation of ubiquitin ligases (MuRF-1 and MuRF-2) localized near titin kinase domain (in M-line), which can affect the titin molecule itself [49, 50] . 14-day HS is known to significantly decrease relative content of titin in rat soleus (Table 1) [51] [52] [53] . The same decrease of titin content was observed in human soleus after 7 days of dry immersion experiment [10] , interestingly, that titin molecule remains intact at the 3rd day of animal HS [7, 51] . These results prove that, at the early stage of disuse, titin remains intact in spite of myoplasm overloading with calcium [7, 28] and increase in calpain activity. Consequently, phosphorylation of titin bound UPS components and their low activity is maintained. Meanwhile, calpastatin overexpression in mice under disuse was shown to prevent slow-to-fast shift in myosin heavy chains (MHCs) [21] . Probably, degradation of one of the calpain targets under disuse impairs regulation of slow MHC expression, which determines MHC phenotype transformation. Moreover, calpain 2 under HS translocates into the nucleus, where it initiates apoptosis [54] .

Intensification of proteolytic activity is caused by increase in quantity of mRNA encoding main UPS members (polyubiquitin, ubiquitin binding enzymes, ubiquitin ligases, 20 S proteasome subunits) and following synthesis of corresponding proteins [59] . The scheme of UPS-dependent degradation of proteins is shown at the Figure 2 . Ubiquitination process needs activation of three UPS enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitinbinding enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3). At first ubiquitin binds to E1 (ATP-dependent process) and then translocates to E2. E3 ligases covalently bind protein substrate and then interact with E2, which carries activated ubiquitin. Ubiquitin in its turn translocates from E2 to the target protein. The process repeats till target protein binds a chain of 4-5 ubiquitin molecules. Then, the ubiquitinated protein degrades into peptides inside proteasome [60] . E3 ligases play an important role in recognition of proteins to be degraded. E2 enzyme and E3 ligase are tissue specific, individual E2 interacts with particular E3 ligase. Usually two main markers of UPS activity are studied, atrogin-1 or muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and MuRF1 (muscle RING finger protein 1) [60] .

Ten days of immobilization caused threefold increase in MuRF-1 mRNA content in quadriceps femoris, which, however, was diminished to the control level to the 21st day of unloading [73] . We also observed changes in expression rate of ubiquitin ligases under HS of animals. Thus, we found that expression rate of MuRF-1 and MAFbx mRNA in rat soleus increased 3 .3 and 2 .1 times, correspondingly, at the 3rd day of disuse. To the 7th day of HS, this parameter decreased but was 1 .27 and 1 .52 times higher than in control (Figure 3 ) [74] . The 37% increase in total level of protein ubiquitination at the 4th day of functional unloading [75] confirms our data.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 264, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 478, "end": 482, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 609, "end": 613, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 777, "end": 781, "text": "[71]", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 905, "end": 909, "text": "[72]", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1096, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1450, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1554, "text": "[75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1434, "end": 1443, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "E3 Ubiquitin Ligases under Functional"}, {"text": "Recently, information appeared about functions of another E3 ubiquitin ligase, MuRF-2, which is splice variant of MuRF-1. MuRF-2 is usually found in embryonic muscle, while, in adult animals, its quantity decreased. In spite of its predominant localization in cytoplasm, partly MuRF-2 is bound to nbr1 and p62 proteins, which localize at titin molecule near M-line ( Figure 4) [49, 76] . Normally, one of the main functions of this protein is stabilization of microtubules population and several proteins of sarcomeric cytoskeleton (desmin, vimentin) during myofibrillogenesis [62] . Besides, along with MuRF-1, MuRF-2 participates in ubiquitination of myofibril proteins [77] . It should be noticed that MuRF-2 is regulated, at least partly, by titindependent mechanism [62] . Changes in spatial arrangement of titin kinase domain after denervation can cause loss of its main function. Consequently, dephosphorylated MuRF-2 dissociates from titin and translocates into the nucleus, where it forces out serum response factor protein (SRF), which is responded for c-fos-mediated stimulation of protein synthesis, cytoskeletal molecules expression, and expression of several growth factors. Our preliminary data showed MuRF-2 translocation to the nucleus and its increased expression under disuse. Thus, 7 days of HS caused increase in MuRF-2 concentration as in myoplasm (from 32.2+5.2 r.u. to 291.9 + 58.5 r.u., according to western blot densitometry According to the data of Lange et al. [49] , it seems that titin conformational changes under unloading should cause degradation of signaling complex, associated with titin kinase domain, and allow MuRF-2 migration to the nucleus. Such change in protein conformation was observed after 2 days of unloading [53] , while data of other authors did not reveal any changes in titin content at the 3rd day of disuse [7, 53] . MuRF-2 concentration in nucleus fraction of rat soleus did not change, as compared to control, at the 3rd day of HS. However, data exist, which demonstrate titin stability at the 3rd day of HS; only after 7 days of HS, titin was degraded noticeably (Table 1 ). These data confirm that at the early stage of unloading myoplasm overloading with calcium [7, 28] and calpains activation cannot stimulate titin proteolysis and, thus, ubiquitin ligases dephosphorylation. Therefore, two triggers of MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 dephosphorylation can exist: Ca 2+ -dependent calpain activation, which initiates myofibril proteins disorganization, and titin conformational changes caused by titin sensitivity to mechanical strain. Further studies are necessary to answer the question. Normally, MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 expression is more pronounced in fast fibers (II type), while, in mice MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 knockouts, and especially in double knockouts (MuRF-1 and MuRF-2), number of fast soleus fibers is significantly decreased. At that, lack of MuRF-1 noticeably prevented atrophy of II type fibers of tibialis anterior [79] . In double knockouts expression of myozenin-1 (calsarcin-1), an endogenous inhibitor of calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway was blocked. Obviously, nucleus localization of MuRF-1 and MuRF-2 stimulates calsarcin expression leading to stabilization of fast phenotype of muscle fiber. Mice MuRF-1 knockouts did not show significant atrophy of soleus after 10 days of HS, while fatigue characteristics were more pronounced, posttetanic potentiation was not as increased as in mice of wild type [80] .

Akt activation and TNF\u03b1 expression did not increase as it happened during cachexia. These facts proved mechanism of atypical activation of NFkB during atrophy caused by functional unloading. This mechanism was called trans-regulation [87] . Importantly, NFkB pathway was not activated under disuse in fast muscles [87] . Possible targets of trans-activation of NFkB under hypokinesia were found recently [88] . Disuse was shown to induce NFkB-dependent increase in expression rate of ubiquitin ligases MAFbx and Nedd4. Analysis of 5 -flanking sites of genes of these ligases allowed finding numerous potential binding sites of NFkB. Moreover, 4EBP1, FoxO3a, and cathepsin L (lysosomal enzyme, which degrades membrane proteins) are also possible targets of NFkB; their expression was increased under disuse atrophy [88] .

This signaling cascade is responsible for stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle fibers realizing its effect particularly through stimulation of proliferation and fusion of satellite cells ( Figure 5 ) [111] . mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a part of two multiprotein complexes, one of which is mTORC1 (sensitive to rapamycin). mTORC1 activates S6 K and 4EBP, through which Akt-FoxO signal is realized. mTOR effect on translation process and protein synthesis is realized through TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinases (S6 K1 and S6 K2) and 4EBP, a repressor of a capbinding protein eIF4 E. S6 K1 is an important component of Akt cascade, which is confirmed by experiments on mice S6 K1 knockouts. Those mice had very small fibers, and could not respond to activated Akt and IGF-1 [121] . Thus, protein synthesis intensification through PI3 K/Akt/mTOR mechanism is realized by means of activation of S6 K1, eukaryotic factor of translation initiation 4 E (eIF4 E), and inhibition of translation regulator 4EBP1. At the same time, IGF-1/PI3 K/Akt pathway prevents atrophy development by inhibition (dephosphorylation by Akt) of transcription regulation factors FoxO1 -3, stimulating their transition from nucleus to cytoplasm [93] . Activity of IGF-1 plays an important role during functional unloading, since ability of muscle cells to bind insulin increased noticeably under disuse. At that, total quantity of insulin receptors did not change [122] . At the same time, activity of PI3 K/Akt signaling cascade, which plays role of central regulator between insulin and IGF-1 receptor, and activated synthetic pathways in muscle, were shown to be diminished significantly [123, 124] . Moreover, it was clearly demonstrated that c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) significantly increased after 10 days of rat HS, as in predominantly fast [125, 126] , so in predominantly slow muscles [127] , on the models of animal HS [125, 127] , cast immobilization [126] , and denervation [128] . Independently of the model used increment in JNK level evidences that IRS-1 protein is phosphorylated, Akt activity is suppressed, and insulin resistance develops in the wasting muscle. Therefore, activation of PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway is important for disused muscle reloading. Nevertheless, it is not the only way of protein synthesis intensification. Eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF4 E), one of the components of eIF4 F complex interacts with eIF3 complex, which regulates assembling of 43 S preinitiation complex (PIC) [129] . eIF3 directly captures 40 S ribosomal subunit stimulating its interaction with Met-tRNA-eIF2-GTP complex and with eIF1. Due to interaction of eIF3 and eIF4 E-mRNA, mRNA binds 43 S ribosomal complex forming 48 S complex, which initiates synthesis of muscle proteins. Studies revealed 13 different subunits of eIF3 complex with molecular mass varying from 170 to 25 kDa. Five of these subunits form the main nucleus of the complex, and others have regulatory function. Role of one of these subunits, eIF3-f, is not known well, though in yeasts and coronaviruses, decrease of eIF3-f quantity leads to significant reduction of total protein content in dividing cells and to decrement of cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 [130] . IL-6, in its turn, is an essential factor of development of skeletal muscle hypertrophy mediated by proliferating satellite cells [131] . In humans, eIF3-f decrease is related to tumor development, while its overexpression suppresses cell growth and leads to apoptosis stimulation [65] . Small quantity of eIF3-f is found in myoblasts of skeletal muscles. Its concentration increases significantly during terminal differentiation and remains at the same level in adult muscle. Interestingly, eIF3-f binds MAFbx in skeletal muscle, which explains, probably, protein synthesis decrease during muscle atrophy of different nature [129] . MAFbx is known to stimulate polyubiquitination of eIF3-f with its following degradation by 26 S proteasome. Therefore, decrease of MAFbx will lead to maintaining of eIF3-f level.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 778, "end": 783, "text": "[111]", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1388, "text": "[121]", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1831, "text": "[93]", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2051, "text": "[122]", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2273, "end": 2278, "text": "[123,", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2283, "text": "124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 2437, "end": 2442, "text": "[125,", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2443, "end": 2447, "text": "126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 2483, "end": 2488, "text": "[127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 2518, "end": 2523, "text": "[125,", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 2524, "end": 2528, "text": "127]", "ref_id": "BIBREF127"}, {"start": 2551, "end": 2556, "text": "[126]", "ref_id": "BIBREF126"}, {"start": 2575, "end": 2580, "text": "[128]", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 3115, "end": 3120, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}, {"start": 3830, "end": 3835, "text": "[130]", "ref_id": "BIBREF130"}, {"start": 3968, "end": 3973, "text": "[131]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 4119, "end": 4123, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 4464, "end": 4469, "text": "[129]", "ref_id": "BIBREF129"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 767, "end": 775, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Muscle Atrophy Is the Balance between Signaling Systems Involved in Regulation of Protein Synthesis and Proteolysis"}, {"text": "eIF3-f directly interacts with mTOR and S6 K1 stimulating assembling of preinitiation complex of translation of specific mRNA encoding proteins, which participate in muscle hypertrophy.

Change of one of its components will certainly lead to alteration of many others.

Functional unloading leads to atrophy of skeletal muscles, which manifests in increased proteolysis leading to decrease of fiber size, muscle mass loss, function deterioration, loss of Ca 2+ sensitivity, and so forth. However, under disuse, balance between protein synthesis and proteolysis shifts so that muscle adapts to the altered circumstances. This conclusion is supported by accumulated knowledge about activity of signaling systems, which take part in proteolysis and synthesis of muscle proteins, as NFkB, for instance. Thus, under disuse, NFkB is activated independently of TNF\u03b1 (decreasing IGF-1-dependent pathway), which may be important, because, in this case, a number of factors blocking PI3 K/Akt pathway and protein synthesis are activated. Thus, unchanged Akt level allows keeping phosphorylation level of FoxO3 and restraining the latter in myoplasm. At the same time, NFkB does not stimulate MuRF-1 activity during hypokinesia/hypogravity [89] , which can limit in some way total level of ubiquitin ligases activity.
