It is uncertain if vaccination of young beef calves reduces BRD morbidity and mortality before weaning age. There is conflicting evidence of the efficacy of vaccination of young dairy calves with MLV vaccines alone or in combination with M haemolytica/P multocida bacterins on the reduction of BRD morbidity and mortality. The level of specific maternal antibodies from colostrum, the ecosystem of respiratory viruses in each farm, and the degree of homology of field versus vaccine virus strains affect efficacy of BRD vaccination in young beef and dairy calves. disease can affect cattle of any age and stage of production, economic losses associated with BRD occur most commonly in the following calf populations:",

            "text": "Stress and immunosuppression are important risk factors for the development of BRD in any of these population groups; however, different factors play a role in the presentation of clinical disease in each group. Failure in the transfer of passive immunity, the level and decay of maternal antibodies (MA), commingling, transport/shipping, dietary changes, and biosecurity breaches can influence the presentation of BRD in calves. 2, 3 The impact of these factors on individual operations introduce variation in the clinical presentation of BRD in each calf group. Despite this variation, whole-herd vaccination against BRD pathogens is a common practice among producers and veterinarians to minimize calf losses associated with morbidity and mortality. 4, 5 Modified-live (MLV) and killed virus (KV) vaccines with different label specifications are commercially available. 6, 7 Recently, a meta-analysis of the efficacy of BRD vaccines demonstrated inconsistency of the reduction of morbidity and mortality in calves. 6, 7 The lack of evidence of efficacy of vaccination against BRD pathogens may affect the practitioner's decision-making process when developing vaccination protocols for cattle operations. The objective of this article is to perform an assessment of the quality of evidence on whether MLV and inactivated antigen vaccines administered parenterally or intranasally provide similar clinical protection against BRD in different calf groups. \"High-quality evidence\" was defined as an outcome reported by 3 or more naturally occurring or experimentally induced BRD vaccine efficacy studies that fulfilled all of the following requirements: clear definition of study population, random and clear allocation of treatment groups, clear definition of disease (morbidity and mortality) outcomes, and blinding of evaluators. \"Moderatequality evidence\" was defined as an outcome reported by at least one vaccine efficacy study that fulfilled all the previously mentioned requirements, and \"low-quality evidence\" was defined as failure to fulfill any of the requirements.",

            "text": "The highest economic impact of BRD on the beef industry is associated with morbidity and mortality of calves shortly after weaning. 1 Therefore, a fundamental goal of vaccination of this group of cattle is to reduce the incidence of BRD after arrival to stocker/ Chamorro & Palomares feedlot operations. Nine studies evaluated the effect of vaccination with MLV (8 studies) and KV (1 study) vaccines on the natural occurrence of BRD in beef calves after conventional (5-8 months) weaning age. 13, 15, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] MLV and KV vaccines included at least one of the following agents: bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV 1), BVDV 2, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), and parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3V). In all studies, vaccination occurred in the transition from weaning to arrival at the stocker/feedlot operation. Significant reduction of morbidity was reported in 75% (6/8) of the studies using MLV vaccination. Further, significant reduction of mortality was observed in 67% (4/6) of studies using MLV vaccination that reported mortality rates. Only one study evaluating the efficacy of KV vaccines reported significant reduction of BRD-associated morbidity and mortality. 21 The introduction of BVDV-2, BCV, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida in combination with MLV, and early vaccination (before weaning, before arrival) increased vaccination efficacy. 22 There is strong and highquality evidence that vaccination of beef calves around the time of weaning with MLV vaccines alone or in combination with M haemolytica/P multocida bacterin/toxoids is superior to vaccination with KV vaccines in reducing naturally occurring BRD morbidity and mortality after weaning.",

Significant reduction of mortality was reported in 100% (5/5) of MLV vaccination studies that reported mortality rates. In both of the 2 studies using KV vaccines, there was a significant reduction of BRD morbidity but none reported mortality. One study compared the effect of MLV versus KV vaccination in recently weaned beef calves and reported no significant differences on BRD morbidity after challenge with BVDV. 35 A recent study compared the effect of vaccination of beef calves at birth and again at 2 months of age, with 1 of 3 vaccine-combination protocols, MLV/MLV, MLV/ KV, or no-vacc/MLV, on clinical protection of calves after experimental challenge with BRSV at weaning. No differences on BRD morbidity and mortality were reported among vaccinated groups. 36 There is strong and high-quality evidence that vaccination of beef calves with vaccines containing MLV alone or in combination with M haemolytica/P multocida bacterins is superior to KV vaccination for reducing BRDassociated morbidity and mortality after experimental challenge with BVDV, BHV-1, or BRSV.",

Similarly, overall preweaning dairy heifer BRD-associated mortality is 19%. 43 The level of interference of colostrum-derived immunity at the time of vaccination can similarly affect clinical protection and efficacy of vaccination in dairy calves. Two studies evaluated the effect of vaccination of dairy calves between 3 days and 6 weeks of age, with single or 2 doses of a multivalent MLV vaccine on the natural occurrence of BRD between 1 and 3 months of age. 17,44,45 Vaccination did not result in significant reduction of naturally occurring BRD morbidity and mortality in any of the studies. One study reported that 21% of the risk of BRD in young dairy calves was the result of failure in the transfer of passive immunity. 46 Calves with a higher colostrum-derived BRSV and IBR antibodies had lower odds of developing signs of BRD compared with calves with lower titers. In another study, calves vaccinated with 2 doses of an intranasal (IN) multivalent MLV vaccine between 3 to 6 days and at 6 weeks of age demonstrated no difference in BRD signs but had less lung consolidation compared with calves vaccinated at 6 weeks, with a single dose of a subcutaneous (SC) MLV vaccine or unvaccinated calves. 45 There is limited moderate quality evidence indicating that vaccination of young dairy calves with multivalent MLV vaccines is ineffective for reducing naturally occurring BRD morbidity and mortality.",

However, there is evidence that they can mount specific T-and B-cell-mediated immune responses that provide variable clinical protection later in life when MA have decayed. 9, 11, 50, 62 Because variability in the transfer of specific passive immunity has been reported in young calves, 66 it becomes challenging to estimate the timing when parenteral vaccination would provide the highest efficacy on protection against respiratory pathogens. Intranasal vaccination is an effective mechanism to induce local mucosal immune priming and immunoglobulin A production IFOMA. 67 Greater mucosal (nasal secretions) and systemic-specific immunity has been reported in calves vaccinated IFOMA intranasally with a MLV BRSV and/or BHV-1 vaccine versus parenteral vaccination. 68 Several studies have demonstrated efficacy of IN vaccination of calves IFOMA on protection against respiratory viruses 53, 58, 68 ; however, few field and experimental challenge studies have compared their efficacy to parenteral vaccines for reducing BRD morbidity or mortality.",

Significant reduction of BRD-associated mortality was reported in 75% of both IN and parenteral vaccination studies that reported mortality rates. Maternally derived antibodies affected immune response and clinical protection offered by parenteral MLV vaccination in calves subsequently challenged with BRSV in one study 9 ; in contrast, maternal immunity had no effect in calves vaccinated parenterally with an adjuvanted MLV BRSV vaccine and subsequently challenged with BRSV in another study. 63 Similarly, calves vaccinated IFOMA with a parenteral MLV BVDV vaccine and subsequently challenged with a homologous BVDV strain were protected against clinical disease. 9,56,62 Regardless of the level of MA, IN and parenteral vaccination of dairy calves against BRSV resulted in clinical protection when experimental challenge occurred less than 4 months of vaccination. 52, 53, 63 There is strong, high-quality evidence that both intranasal and parenteral vaccination of young dairy calves with MLV vaccines result in similar reduction of BRD-associated morbidity and mortality after experimental challenge with respiratory viruses.",

Only 2 studies 36,70 (14.3%) evaluated intranasal vaccines alone or in a combination protocol with parenteral vaccines. In one study, calves were vaccinated with an IN vaccine containing BHV-1, BRSV, and PI3V and subsequently challenged with BRSV. In the other study, calves were vaccinated with an IN vaccine containing BVDV 1, BVDV 2, BHV-1, BRSV, and PI3V and subsequently challenged with BHV-1. Significant reduction of BRD-associated morbidity and mortality was reported in the BHV-1 challenge study but not in the BRSV challenge study. Significant reduction of BRD morbidity and mortality was reported in 67% and 57% of studies, respectively that used parenteral MLV vaccines in calves that were subsequently challenged with BVDV, BRSV, or BHV-1. 24-29, [31] [32] [33] 35, 40, 41 Intranasal vaccination of beef calves at 3 to 6 weeks of age and again at 6 months of age with an IN or SC vaccine was associated with reduced BRD morbidity after BHV-1 challenge. 70 Moreover, in this study, the vaccination protocol based on IN priming and IN booster resulted in reduced BHV1 shedding. In addition, vaccination with a single dose of the IN vaccine at 3 to 6 weeks or at 6 months of age with no additional booster was associated with reduction of mortality but not BRD morbidity. In another study, IN MLV vaccination at birth in addition to SC MLV or KV booster at 2 months of age was not different from SC MLV vaccination at 2 months for reducing BRD morbidity after BRSV challenge at weaning. 36 There is limited, moderate-quality evidence that vaccination of beef calves with parenteral multivalent MLV vaccines is superior to IN MLV vaccines on reducing BRD-associated morbidity and mortality after experimental challenge with BVDV, BHV-1, or BRSV.",

The presence of BVDV 1 and BVDV 2 antigens in parenteral multivalent MLV vaccines plays an important role in providing clinical protection against BRD. There is limited evidence of efficacy of vaccination of young beef calves (preweaning) with parenteral or IN MLVor KV vaccines in reducing naturally occurring or experimentally induced BRD morbidity and mortality before weaning age. There is an evident need for additional research to determine true effects of vaccination, type of vaccines, and routes of administration in this group of cattle. With respect to vaccination of dairy calves for the prevention of BRD, there is a lack of connection between results from naturally occurring and experimentally induced BRD vaccine-efficacy studies. There is limited moderate-quality evidence that vaccination of young dairy calves with parenteral or IN MLV vaccines is ineffective for reducing naturally occurring BRD. In contrast, there is strong evidence that vaccination of young dairy calves with parenteral or IN MLV vaccines is effective providing clinical protection against BRD after experimental challenge with respiratory viruses. The level and duration of specific MA against respiratory viruses of calves from individual cow-calf and dairy operations play an important role in providing clinical protection as well as in affecting vaccine efficacy against BRD.",
