With their personal and possibly their family's lives and health at risk, they must weigh the option of continuing to work or retreat to safety. This decision, made daily, is based on professional and personal values, how they perceive existing risks-including available protective measures, and their perception of the level and transparency of information they receive. Often, while clinicians get this information, support personnel do not, leading to absenteeism and deteriorating healthcare services. Leadership can use good risk communication (complete, widely transmitted, and transparent) to align healthcare workers' risk perceptions with reality. They also can address the common problems healthcare workers must overcome to continue working (ie, risk mitigation techniques). Physicians, if they cannot sufficiently husband or improvise lifesaving resources, will have to face difficult triage decisions. Ideally, they will use a predetermined plan, probably based on the principles of Utilitarianism (maximizing the greatest good) and derived from professional and community input. Unfortunately, none of these plans is optimal. [West J Emerg Med. 2020;21(3) 477-483.] professionals weigh risk factors related to their response and the actions the healthcare community can take, including proper communication and mitigating responder concerns, to maximize and maintain our caregiver workforce. I then very briefly discuss the ethics of scarce resources and suggest options, such as recalling retired clinicians to service, improvisation, and husbanding available resources to mitigate rationing.",

Emergency physicians exhibit courage when they assume personal risk to provide steadfast care for all emergency patients, including those who are agitated, violent, infectious, and the like.\" 3 Despite these professional ethical codes, nothingeither morally or legally-compels a response to risk-prone situations. Other than military personnel, no one is required to respond to potentially life-threatening emergencies. Professional oaths and codes may serve to guide practitioners, but they are not absolutes.

Providing the best current information about the risks as well as the opportunities to assist during a crisis will help healthcare professionals make defensible decisions in disaster settings. 5 Transparent and consistent information generates the trust necessary for both caregivers and the population to develop a reasonable risk assessment during conditions of uncertainty. 11 Issuing incomplete or conflicting information, as was done during the first months of the COVID-19 outbreak, caused many providers to make decisions to respond based on heated emotions and inaccurate risk perceptions. People have been shown to naturally exaggerate the risk of phenomena that are unknown or \"dreaded,\" such as those with delayed, irreversible or manmade effects; those that have new, unknown, or unobservable risks; those that are global; and those that are \"hyped\" by the media. 5 Historical precedent and the nature of the medical profession demonstrate that we will have enough physicians and, probably, nurses to treat patients. Other professional and non-professional staff needed to keep healthcare institutions operating may not be as willing to risk themselves. Recent history suggests that we probably will not have enough support personnel because, although they may be at as much or more risk than healthcare professionals, their personal safety is often considered as an afterthought by administrators. \"An important lesson from the SARS outbreak is that, whereas most clinicians will ''stay and fight,'' vital support personnel, including those in materials and supply, logistics, cleaning, information technology communications, maintenance, and refuse removal, may feel no commitment to assist; moreover, they may feel undervalued, unprotected from risks, and ignored when they are omitted from vital communications.\" 12 If all the staff necessary to run medical facilities fail to receive timely, relevant and believable information, they may not respond, and the quality of available healthcare will deteriorate. Widely distributing accurate risk assessments and descriptions of protective measures for staff will encourage the maximal number of clinicians and other necessary personnel to respond to the situation. Therefore, disaster planners and managers should do everything possible to communicate the risks clearly to all members of the healthcare system and to provide them with as much support and security as possible.",

To address one concern, on March 20, 2020, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine issued a position statement saying, in part, that they believe \"a physician, nurse, PA, first responder or other healthcare professional has the right to be removed from the schedule of work requiring direct contact with patients potentially infected with COVID-19 for issues of personal health, such as being on immunosuppressive therapy or other similar concerns, without the risk of termination of employment.\" 15 Rarely discussed, but a key part of maintaining our workforce, is to support the psychosocial needs of the healthcare team.

Specifically, it requires impartial and neutral decision makers to consistently apply rationing decisions across people and time (treating like cases alike). 32 This is based on Utilitarian principles, including conservation of resources, fiduciary responsibility (stewardship), multiplier effect (does the person have a job that will save other lives?), immediate usefulness, medical success, and caretaker role. 33, 34 Most ethicists agree, however, that such distribution should be equitable, although in some circumstances other distribution methods, such as first come, first served; equal distribution; and even, no distribution may be more rational. Even with agreement about equitable distribution, scarcity often requires clinicians to prioritize which patients receive the resources. 33, 34 As the COVID-19 pandemic extends its devastation, physicians around the world are already facing the daunting task of rationing lifesaving resources. This is upending their traditional method of treating the sickest first in emergency departments or \"first come first served\" in the ICUs. 31 In Italy, physicians have reported limiting ventilators to those less than 60 years old, and China and Spain have implemented medical resource rationing. The US government and many states that have developed rationing plans have yet to explicitly implement them. 35 Many of these plans may be outdated, and none have been tested to determine whether they will save lives. In fact, a Canadian study of H1N1 patients found that 70% of patients that a rationing plan would have removed from ventilators survived with continued ventilation. 36 Dr. Laura Evans, an intensivist at the University of Washington, is working with her state to devise a triage plan that would be doing \"the most good for the most people and be fair and equitable and transparent in the process.\" Yet the Washington State Health Department recently issued a statement that \"triage teams under crisis conditions should consider transferring patients out of the hospital or to palliative care if the patient's baseline functioning was marked by 'loss of reserves in energy, physical ability, cognition and general health.'\" 36 Rationing plans must conform to general ethical principles and to existing community moral standards. Community input into these plans is vital for maintaining the public's trust in \u2022 Prepare-e.g., anticipate challenges, develop plans, stockpile materials. Identify leaders who can source or develop alternative supplies and equipment. Identify and train risk communicators. Plan to mitigate personnel difficulties in responding. \u2022 Conserve-implement conservation strategies for supplies in shortage or anticipated shortage to ensure the minimum impact/compromise possible (e.g., determining \"at-risk\" groups with priority for therapies in shortage and overall strategies to conserve use of oxygen delivery devices [i.e., ventilators] or PPE. \u2022 Substitute-provide an equivalent or near-equivalent medication or delivery device. \u2022 Adapt-use of equipment for alternative purposes (e.g., anesthesia machine as ventilator) \u2022 Re-use-plan to re-use a wide variety of materials after appropriate disinfection or sterilization (e.g., may include oxygen delivery devices). \u2022 Re-allocate-if no alternatives exist, remove a resource from one area/patient and allocate to another who has a higher likelihood of benefit (i.e., greater chance of surviving or more post-disease years to live). Healthcare Ethics During a Pandemic Iserson clinicians, the institutions, and the organizations involved in disaster relief and resource allocation. A major ethical dilemma is that current rationing criteria may skew away from normally disadvantaged populations. In the past, allocation plans were developed by the healthcare community. In the current crisis, some planning groups have tried to address this by asking disparate communities throughout their region to offer input into the plans. 36 In all circumstances, rationing scarce medical resources is difficult and stressful. Such distribution, rather than being based on politics, money or power, must be based on an equitable (fair), openly available, pre-existing plan. It may be beneficial to have emergency physicians and intensivists take the lead (under set protocols) in making these decisions, since they have had more experience than others in doing this on a regular basis. Ideally, they will have support from their institutions' bioethics consultants, social workers, and chaplains.",

This can help you stay ahead of possible rumors. \u2022 Share information about the signs and symptoms of disease, who is at risk, treatment and care options, and when to seek medical care. 2. Be Right: Accuracy establishes credibility. Information should include what is known, what is not known, and what is being done to fill in the information gaps. \u2022 Public health messages and medical guidance must complement each other. For example, public health officials should not widely encourage people to go to the doctors if doctors are turning people away and running out of medicine for critically ill people. \u2022 Always fact check with subject-matter experts. One incorrect message can cause harmful behaviors and may result in people losing trust in future messages. 3. Be Credible: Honesty, timeliness, and scientific evidence encourage the public to trust your information and guidance. Acknowledge when you do not have enough information to answer a question and then work with the appropriate experts to get an answer. \u2022 Do not make promises about anything that is not yet certain, such as distribution of vaccines or mediciations without confirmed availability. \u2022 Clinicians should be present at press or community events to answer medical questions. 4.
