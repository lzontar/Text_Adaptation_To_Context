This clinical study aims to investigate the clinical features, radiographic and laboratory tests, complications, treatments, and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes. This retrospective study included 208 hospitalized patients (\u2265 45 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during the period between 12 January and 25 March 2020. Information from the medical record, including clinical features, radiographic and laboratory tests, complications, treatments, and clinical outcomes, were extracted for the analysis. 96 (46.2%) patients had comorbidity with type 2 diabetes. In COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes, the coexistence of hypertension (58.3% vs. 31.2%), coronary heart disease (17.1% vs. 8.0%), and chronic kidney diseases (6.2% vs. 0%) was significantly higher than in COVID-19 patients without type 2 diabetes. The frequency and degree of abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) chest scans in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes were markedly increased, including ground-glass opacity (85.6% vs. 64.9%, P < 0.001) and bilateral patchy shadowing (76.7% vs. 37.8%, P < 0.001). In addition, the levels of blood glucose (7.23 mmol\u00b7L -1 (interquartile range (IQR): 5.80-9.29) vs. 5.46 mmol\u00b7L -1",

According to coronavirus reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome may have up to 10 times greater risk of death when infected with COVID-19 [5] . In 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients from 575 hospitals, 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity [6] . The most prevalent comorbidity of COVID-19 was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%) . This report has drawn considerable attention to on COVID-19 coexisting disorders patients. The presence of coexisting illness was found to be more common among severe patients [7] . COVID-19 patients have underlying risk factors associated with mortality, including male gender, advanced age, and the presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases [8] . The major comorbidities in fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis [9] .

Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, healthcare providers, and elderly people [12] . Given the higher mortality and higher proportion of critically ill adult COVID-19 patients with diabetes, good in-patient glycemic control is particularly important in the comprehensive treatment of COVID-19. Individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to the specific circumstances of COVID-19 patients with diabetes [13, 14] .",

It has been well established that hypertension, coronary heart disease, and chronic renal disease coexist with diabetes, leading to a higher risk of morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. In diabetic patients and patients with related glucose and lipid dysfunctions, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor overexpresses in multiple organs such as the lung, kidney, and liver, which facilitates the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to the cell receptor ACE2 [19] . Several lines of evidence suggest that diabetes is a risk factor for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 [17, 20] . Our study enhanced this hypothesis.

Serum IgA has an important role in the protection of the mucociliary areas, and acts as a barrier against pathogenic organisms, antigens, and even allergens [22] . The combination of COVID-19 and diabetes has a different effect on immune status than COVID-19 without diabetes, as glucose and lipid metabolism disorders may increase the immune response. . These findings suggest that diabetic patients with COVID-19 are more likely to show abnormal blood coagulation function in clinical practice. During the inflammatory storm, blood coagulation was abnormal. In the early stage, this is the result of inflammation-activating plasmin. Subsequently, hypoxia-induced molecules can activate thrombin directly, with progressive inflammation, and the activation of monocyte-macrophages also secretes a number of tissue factors, activating the exogenous coagulation pathway, which leads to an overall hypercoagulable state [17] .",

Therefore, we could not analyze the impact of glucocorticoids on the glucose level of COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes due to insufficient clinical data. This is a limitation of the study. Although glucocorticoids unavoidably affect the blood glucose level, there is no evidence that the administration of glucocorticoids worsens COVID-19. In the future, the influence of glucocorticoids on COVID-19 patients with diabetes will be further investigated.",

This new finding strongly supports our proposed novel concept of glucolipid metabolic disease (GLMD) and an integrated strategy for the treatment of the whole spectrum of metabolic diseases underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection [25] . It has been recognized that disorders in the metabolism of glucose and lipids act as the initial trigger and as a potent driving force in the development and progress of various metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular complications. As the metabolism of lipids and glucose is a highly coordinated process under both physiological and diseased conditions, impairment in the signals corresponding to the metabolism of either lipids or glucose is not only a common mechanism, but also the key mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of GLMD [26] .",

Although several previous studies have reported on diabetes as one of the most common comorbidities in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [7, 27, 28] , the pathophysiological consequence of the close association between diabetes and COVID-19 progression still remains elusive. Our analysis highlights the markedly promoted morbidity in diabetes patients with COVID-19 infection. The frequency and degree of abnormalities in radiologic examinations of diabetic COVID-19 patients were notably higher than those in the control group without diabetes. In addition, disruption in the homeostatic control of glucose metabolism and blood pressure was more severe in diabetic COVID-19 patients. Diabetes and its related metabolic disorders have consistently been documented as one of the key risk factors for severe outcomes in patients infected with other types of coronavirus, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [29, 30] and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [31] . Thus, our data in the present study demonstrate that diabetes and its associated metabolic complications are a crucial contributor to enhanced morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

On the one hand, our data suggest that maintenance of the homeostasis in glucose and lipid metabolism via optimal clinical management in COVID-19 patients is mandatory. Furthermore, evidence from infection with another member of the coronavirus family-namely, SARS-CoV-has demonstrated that the binding of SARS-CoV to its receptor ACE2 in the pancreas results in islet damage and a notable decrease in the release of insulin, thereby causing short-term hyperglycemia, and even the onset of diabetes [32] . Furthermore, SARS-CoV-evoked diabetes-like traits markedly potentiate the progression to multiple-organ failure via a positive feedback loop. Therefore, tight control of the parameter set of glucose and lipid metabolism may be the key to optimal clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients without a history of diabetes and/or other metabolic diseases. On the other hand, diabetes has attained epidemic proportions worldwide. According to estimated data from the International Diabetes Federation, 415 million people have diabetes mellitus, with 90% of these individuals having type 2 diabetes mellitus [33] . Hence, powerful and integrated approaches should be launched for the comprehensive prevention of GLMD, which is of significant importance for marked reduction in the morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases.",
