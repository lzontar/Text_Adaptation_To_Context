The research objective is to develop a Saudi e-health literacy scale (SeHL) for measuring e-health literacy among Saudis suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCD). Methods: Overall, 14 relevant papers in related interdisciplinary fields were reviewed to select the most useful literacy dimensions. From these articles, we extracted the most common dimensions used to measure e-health literacy across the disciplines. Multiple workshops with multidisciplinary team members reviewed and evaluated items for SeHL. Results: Four key aspects of e-health literacy-use of technology/media, information-seeking, usefulness and confidence-were identified and integrated as e-health literacy dimensions. These will be used to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients with NCDs. A translation from Arabic to English was performed in order to ensure that translation process was accurate. A SeHL scale was developed to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients. By understanding e-health literacy levels, we will be able to create a patient-education system to be used by patients in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: As information technology is increasingly used by people of all ages all over the world, e-health literacy has been identified as a key factor in determining health outcomes. To date, no comprehensive scale exists to assess e-health literacy levels among speakers of Arabic, particularly among people with NCD such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Literacy is defined as the ability to read and write, whereas health literacy refers to the ability to understand and use health-related information to achieve good health [1] .

Worldwide, 48 million people have died from NCDs. In Saudi Arabia, NCDs accounted for 73% of the national mortality rate [2] . A major public health problem is diabetes, which is one of the four NCDs prioritized by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3] . The prevalence of diabetes has almost doubled globally since 1980, and affecting 8.5% of the world's population in 2014 [3] . Prevention requires patients to understand steps and procedures for monitoring their diabetes, and management of diabetes may involve taking insulin or other medication in a consistent manner. Therefore, WHO recommends addressing the key gaps in patients' knowledge in the disease and related health issues.
