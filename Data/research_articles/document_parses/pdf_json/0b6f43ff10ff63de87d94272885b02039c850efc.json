It is a respiratory disease, and acute kidney injury (AKI) is rare; however, if a patient develops severe AKI, renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be considered. Recently, we had a critically ill COVID-19 patient who developed severe AKI and needed continuous RRT (CRRT). To avoid the potential risk of infection from CRRT effluents, we measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic material in the effluents by qRT-PCR, and low copy numbers of the viral genome were detected. Due to unstable hemodynamic status in critically ill patients, CRRT should be the first choice for severe AKI in COVID-19 patients. We suggest prevention of clinical infection and control during administration of RRT in the acute phase of COVID-19 patients with AKI or multiple organ failure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a life-threatening disorder, although the rate of AKI in COVID-19 is relatively rare.

On day 3, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. His sCre gradually decreased from 1.34 mg/dL (day 1) to 1.06 mg/dL (day 6). As the urine output gradually decreased, sCre increased from day 7 and reached 3.46 mg/dL on day 9, when CRRT was initiated. Nafamostat mesylate was used for anticoagulation. Cytokine-absorbing polymethyl methacrylate membrane [2, 3] was used as a hemofilter. During the management of CRRT, there is a risk of the presence of the virus in the CRRT effluent [4] . To evaluate this possibility, we measured SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the CRRT effluent by qRT-PCR Katagiri et al. [5] . A very weak but positive RT-PCR result was detected in 3 of 5 specimens (Table 1) . We disposed the CRRT effluent in a container using fluid coagulant agent, closed the lid, and treated it as hazardous waste.

Higher morbidity has been reported among the elderly and in those with coexisting disease conditions [7] . With the increasing number of COVID-19 patients, the need for RRT is likely to increase. To prevent the spread of infection, all staff who managed CRRT wore personal protective equipment comprising standard, contact, and droplet precautions; gloves; N95 mask; gown; cap; and face shield. Although the recommendation by the WHO for the use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 did not include CRRT [8] , we considered the risk of aerosol generation during CRRT. The pore size of a hemofilter is 7-10 nm [9] and the size of 2019-nCoV is about 100 nm [10] , which suggests that the permeability of 2019-nCoV into CRRT effluent is significantly low.
