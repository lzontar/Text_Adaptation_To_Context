Despite poor propagation in human lung tissue, viral antigen was detected in cells infected with low-pathogenicity avian and classic swine virus at similar rates.

The suitability of the lung organ cultures for our study was supported by the findings that HPAIV-H5N1 and humanadapted seasonal and pandemic viruses propagated efficiently.

In fact, differences in the target cell type correlated with the magnitudes in replication of avian and human influenza A viruses in reconstituted human tracheobronchial epithelium [35, 36] . Similarly, it had been proposed that preferential infection of type II pneumocytes by H5N1 viruses in human lung may explain high viral loads and strong pathologic responses in patients and nonhuman primates [10, 11, 23] . This suggestion was based on the fast metabolism of this cell type and its essential roles in maintaining alveolar surface tension and the initiation of repair processes [12, 27, 37] . However, the immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses of explanted lung tissues in essence debilitated this hypothesis as HPAIV-H5N1 and all other examined viruses showed a strong preference to infect type II pneumocytes, although they varied up to several orders of magnitude in their progeny titers. These results confirm and extend previous reports on the detection of viral antigen from pandemic and seasonal strains in type II pneumocytes, which however, did not address the production of infectious virus particles in this cell type [38, 39] . We found it intriguing that at least one other important respiratory viral pathogen, SARS coronavirus, has evolved to preferentially replicate in type II pneumocytes although it clearly uses a different receptor for cell entry than influenza viruses [40] [41] [42] .

Also, the pandemic H1N1-2009 virus provoked a weak cytokine response, which confirms previous reports involving infected human macrophages, dendritic cells, and primary alveolar cells [47, 48] . The low level of cytokine induction may have contributed to the successful propagation and rapid spread of the H1N1-pdm virus in humans. H5N1 virus replicated at least as well as seasonal H3N2 virus but induced strong cytokine responses in resident alveolar cells in human lung explants.
