A mesoporous film of alternate layers of Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (bilayers), deposited onto an optical fibre was used. The sensing film behaves as a Fabry-Perot cavity of low-finesse where the absorption of water vapour changes the optical thickness and produces a change in reflection proportional to humidity. Methods: The mesoporous film was deposited upon the cleaved tip of an optical fibre using the layer-by-layer method. The sensor was calibrated in a bench model against a commercially available capacitive sensor. The sensitivity and response time were assessed in the range from 5 % relative humidity (RH) to 95%RH for different numbers of bilayers up to a maximum of nine. Results: The sensitivity increases with the number of bilayers deposited; sensitivity of 2.28 mV/%RH was obtained for nine bilayers. The time constant of the response was 1.13 s \u00b1 0.30 s which is faster than the commercial device (measured as 158 s). After calibration, the optical fibre humidity sensor was utilised in a bench top study employing a mechanical ventilator. The fast response time enabled changes in humidity in individual breaths to be resolved. Conclusion: Optical fibre sensors have the potential to be used to monitor breath to breath humidity during ventilator care. Significance: Control of humidity is an essential part of critical respiratory care and the developed sensor provides a sensitive, compact and fast method of humidity monitoring.",

Fibers are advantageous due to their light weight, simple configuration, small size, high sensitivity, efficiency, and resolution. They carry no electric current, are biocompatible, and potentially inexpensive optical sensors that have been demonstrated to be the fastest humidity sensors [3] , [8] . There are a number of practical ways for building up optical fiber sensors to detect humidity such as evanescent wave monitoring, in-fiber gratings (fiber Bragg grating and long period grating) techniques, interferometric approaches, hybrid sensors (grating + interferometric), and absorption measurements [3] , [9] . In the research described here, the goal is to develop an optical fiber Fabry-Perot interferometric sensor to detect humidity by increasing sensitivity through the deposition of a hydrophilic coating material on the cleaved distal optical fiber tip (forming a Fabry-Perot cavity). In comparison to other sensing techniques, the interferometric approach proposed in this study has the advantage of simple configuration, small size probe (125 \u03bcm), and low cost manufacture. On exposure of the hydrophilic film to a humid environment, the water vapor is absorbed, changing the refractive index and thickness of the film, inducing a change in the overall reflection [8] .",

The reflection spectrum will change when the geometrical thickness (L) increases by means of either the number of film layers deposited on the tip or the swelling due to water absorption [8] . The response in the total optical intensity reflected can also be modulated by adsorption and absorption of water vapour molecules by means of changing the effective refractive index of the film (\u03b7f), following the Bruggeman effective medium model criteria [11] .",

            "text": "The optical fiber sensor contained within a 23-gauge medical hypodermic needle and capacitive sensor were both placed in the T-piece valve [see Fig. 4 (a) and (c)]. There were also two removable temperature probes integrated in the breathing circuit, one included in the humidifier itself and another placed at the end of the humidification arm, just before the connection with the exhalation valve [see Fig. 4(a) ]. Independent of the mode of ventilation used, the change of humidity throughout the breathing circuit was controlled by switching ON/OFF the humidifier. There are several classifications of HMEs: hydrophobic, hygroscopic, and filtered HMEs [4] , [6] . In this case, a hygroscopic and filtered HME was used to reduce condensation in the T-piece [see left side of Fig. 4(c) ] and the overall change of temperature inside the breathing circuit. The wool-foam material of this HME contains an antibacterial filter and hygroscopic chemicals (e.g., LiCl, CaCl 2 ) that reduces water condensation and the presence of moisture (small droplets), improving the response of the optical fiber humidity sensor. Fig. 5 shows the hydrophilic film [see Fig. 5 (b) and (c)] created during the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly process. Comparison of Fig. 5(b) and (c) confirms that highly uniform film is deposited onto optical fiber after four bilayers [15] . The growth of the initial layers is not uniform due to lack of surface coverage and some parts will not be fully charged after deposition of the first layers of PAH. Coverage can be boosted by controlling parameters such as solution concentration of the polyelectrolytes used, pH and dipping times [16] . More uniform multilayer growth has been reported with the use of an initial assembly adhesion stage of PAH and Poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)(SPS) in the initial layers [17] . It should be noted that only the tip of the optical fiber coated with the PAH/SiO 2 film is interrogated and the side is not contributing to the sensor response. Fig. 6 shows a typical sensor response for a four bilayer film on exposure to different levels of humidity. The reflection spectra acquired are in the visible range and only the central wavelength (after applying a 100-points moving average filter) \u03bb = 618.13 nm was plotted in all figures of this work in order to measure the response of the optical fibre humidity sensor. It can be seen that the response of the optical fiber humidity sensor is inversely correlated with the response of the capacitive sensor. It should be noted that in this calibration experiment the temporal transitions of the capacitive sensor and optical fiber sensor between every step in Fig. 6 , are similar and are only limited by the rate of change of air in the flowmeters, i.e., the transition times are not related to the response time of the two sensors. Fig. 7 shows the effect of the film thickness on the sensitivity. The thicker PAH/SiO 2 film leads to an increase in the sensitivity of the optical fiber humidity sensor. The increase of the geometrical thickness leads to a sinusoidal-type change in the reflection (tracked at specific wavelengths) whose intensity depends on the number of layers [15] , [18] . For three bilayers, the sensitivity was 0.26 mV/%RH, for four bilayers sensitivity increased to 0.53 mV/%RH and for nine bilayers, the sensitivity increased to 2.28 mV/%RH (see Fig. 7) . Briefly, the increase in the thickness of the film produces higher finesse values [19, Ch. 7] , and therefore, sharper or more sensitive response to effective refractive index change (typically from 1.22 to 1.33) and geometrical thickness when the mesoporous film is exposed to water vapor molecules [8] , [10] .",

Fig. 11 shows measurements taken with the optical fiber humidity sensor with nine bilayers and the capacitive sensor inside the T-piece of the breathing circuit [see Fig. 4(a) and (c)] and using a different mode of ventilation, i.e., IPPV; this mode was first tested with a fixed pressure of 15 cm H 2 O and 12 breaths per minute (Breaths/min) with the humidifier switched ON. The output of a moving average filter (with 100 points) has been applied to the responses of the capacitive sensor and the optical fiber humidity sensor and the average baseline (black lines in Fig. 11 ) increased from 2968 to 3568 mV for the fiber sensor and decreased from 93%RH to 89%RH for the capacitive sensor during the measurement period (600 s). The inset in Fig. 11 is a close up view between 200 and 260 s that corroborates that only the optical fiber humidity sensor can detect individual breaths due to its faster response. Fig. 12(a) and (b) shows a new subset of measurements for t = 300-360 s (600 s total experiment duration) with the optical fiber humidity sensor using nine bilayers deposited on the tip of the fiber. These measurements compare different breathing frequencies for the same pressure in IPPV mode and also compare different pressures of IPPV for the same frequency. The fast response of the sensor is again demonstrated through breath to breath humidity measurements. Fig. 12 (a) confirms that the slower breath frequency will produce smaller baseline reflection intensity and higher RH for a fixed ventilation pressure of 30-cm H 2 O. Fig. 12(b) shows that at lower pressures, IPPV will produce a smaller baseline reflection intensity and higher RH for a fixed breath frequency of 20 Breaths/min.",

            "text": "Although the fluctuations in the light source are small (drift less than 0.3% per hour), any transmission loss artefacts can be avoided by including a reference fibre without the mesoporous film in the system. In this way, any fluctuation in the light source and any other source of artefact (like motions in the sensor probe causing transmission losses) would be also detected by that reference fibre and could be significantly reduced through signal processing. The results (section C) confirm that an HME acts as a hydrophobic filter protecting the sensor against condensation that can produce artefacts and is useful as it restricts temperature variations. In this direction, it is also beneficial to monitor temperature as it is well known that measuring relative humidity depends on temperature. The calibration results obtained in Figs. 6 to 9 were performed at a constant room temperature (23.0\u00b0C 0.5\u00b0C). In practical use in noninvasive mechanical ventilation, large temperature variations can be avoided (up to 1\u00b0C) using an HME in the breathing circuit (Figs. 10 and 11 ). In future, it would also be favourable to coat the tip of the hypodermic needle containing the fibreoptic sensor with the wool/foam material used in the HME and further improvements could be made by writing a fibre Bragg grating into the fibre so that temperature can be simultaneously monitored. The main reason to use the spectrometer in this paper was to optimize the working wavelength and this could be simplified using an LED and photodetector. However as future work will involve the use of fibre Bragg gratings to monitor temperature it is likely that the spectrometer will be retained. Future work will investigate how the response time and sensitivity change with SiO2 nanoparticle size, optimizing levels of aggregation and porosity. Surface coverage of the initial layers onto the tip of the optical fibre can be also improved by modifying the deposition procedure and increasing the efficiency of SiO2 adsorption through direct surface modification of the nanoparticles (creating higher number of ligands that will intensify the negative charge of the SiO2 particles before they are coated with PAH).",
