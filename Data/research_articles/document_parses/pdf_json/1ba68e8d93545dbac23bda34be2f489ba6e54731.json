Restricting our current surgical volume is an attempt to decrease exposures for our patients and healthcare workers while preserving personal protective equipment. As the first wave of this pandemic subsides, hospital systems are faced with prioritizing which surgical services can resume while simultaneously minimizing the disruption of ongoing care for the remaining COVID-19 patients. This is all while ensuring our patient population at home is able to receive appropriate care.",

The effects of general anesthesia, the trauma of undergoing an incision, is a physical breach unwanted by those who can avoid it. However, in the era of limited resources in a pandemic, this word has developed a new meaning. \"Elective\" -a normally one-dimensional word reflective of whether a surgery is an emergency or not now has an added dimension of temporality. How does one quantify an emergency? Will this patient survive one week, one month, one pandemic without undergoing surgery? In a medical structure now limited by resources, as well as patient and provider exposure, guidelines have been disseminated by multiple bodies. CMS created guidelines to guide surgical management stratified by local COVID-19 disease burden, resource availability, and patient disease severity. Hospitals now function with a new set of perioperative management to limit exposure of healthcare workers (1).",

Patients requiring oncologic surgery now face a \"double jeopardy\" of increased exposure to COVID-19 due to frequent interactions with medical facilities, but also worse outcomes associated with delaying surgery. ACS created a set of guidelines relying on anticipated phases of the pandemic: Guidelines have also been created on a federal and state-wide level. But who will enforce? At a time when hospitals are furloughing staff, reducing salaries for staff, and scrambling for PPE for their employees, it would be in the financial interest of keeping a hospital running to proceed with elective surgeries in an effort to help mend the expected deficits of hundreds of millions per hospital. But how will these tenuous months be remembered in history? As certain areas in the country have the resources to resume elective surgery, how will they be remembered in a time when other, heavily affected parts of the country struggle with unmet needs for goods and services? (2) How will public opinion change as institutions protect their financial interests over the wellbeing of their neighbors? As the federal government makes decisions to re-open the economy, how will each state be remembered for their own autonomous decisions to do what is best for their citizens based on the data they have?",

More than 21 million surgeries were done in the United states in 2014 (3), with an estimate that over 90% of these surgeries are considered elective (4) . With an estimated three-month delay of elective cases, almost 5 million cases will be delayed, some for the entire three-month course, resulting in both immediate and repercussive effects. Delaying resection for clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer by 8 weeks or greater after radiologic findings concerning for lung cancer is independently associated with increased rates of upstaging and decreased median survival (5) . Those who are anxious to come into a hospital setting with abdominal pain present days later with gangrenous, perforated appendicitis and cholecystitis. Patients with delayed elective aneurysm repairs wait at home with increasing risk of rupture. As the immediate wave of morbidity and mortality associated directly with the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the effects of delaying both diagnosis and surgery will be revealed.",

His exquisite tenderness and skin changes required emergent repair. With penetrating fear in his eyes, he told his surgical team of his siblings who had both gotten sick and passed in the last year. His fear of becoming sick or dying was recognized and acknowledged -who wouldn't be afraid in his position; but he was safe now, in the care of physicians who knew exactly how to fix the cause of his pain. There was no better place for him to have his problem than in the hospital. Now he was here, and everything else was in our hands. His trembling grip and imploring gaze made clear his fear felt seen but was not mitigated.

In addition, there is no clear evidence on permanent immunity against COVID-19.
