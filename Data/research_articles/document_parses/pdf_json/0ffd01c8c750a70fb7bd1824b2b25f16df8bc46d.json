            "text": "The airway epithelium is a key protective barrier whose integrity is preserved by the selfrenewal and differentiation of basal progenitor cells. Epithelial cells are central to the pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. In chronic diseases, increasing age is a principle risk factor. In acute diseases, such as COVID-19, children suffer less severe symptoms than adults and have a lower rate of mortality. Few studies have explored differences between airway epithelial cells in children and adults to explain this age dependent variation in diseases. Here, we perform bulk RNA sequencing studies in laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium, FACS-sorted basal cells and cultured basal cells, as well as in vitro cell proliferation experiments, to address the intrinsic molecular differences between paediatric and adult airway basal cells. We find that, while the cellular composition of the paediatric and adult tracheobronchial epithelium is broadly similar, in cell culture, paediatric airway epithelial cells displayed higher colony forming ability, better in vitro growth and outcompeted adult cells in competitive proliferation assays. In RNA sequencing experiments, we observed potentially important differences in airway epithelial gene expression between samples from children and adults. However, genes known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were not differentially expressed between children and adults. Our results chart cell-intrinsic differences in transcriptional profile and regenerative capacity between proximal airway epithelial cells of children and adults.",

Functionally, the epithelium secretes a mucous layer and produces motile force to flow mucus proximally out of the lungs, providing protection against noxious particles and pathogens. These specialized functions are accomplished by luminal mucosecretory and ciliated epithelial cells, respectively. The differentiated cell types in this slow-turnover tissue are replenished by airway basal cells, which act as multipotent progenitors (Rock et al., 2010; Teixeira et al., 2013) .",

A novel CFTR-producing population, the ionocyte (Montoro et al., 2018; Plasschaert et al., 2018) , has been described, and we have new insight into cellular differentiation through the resolution of differentiation intermediates; for example, basal luminal progenitor cells (Mori et al., 2015; Rock et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2015) , which are defined by an intermediate keratin profile (TP63-/KRT5+/KRT8+/KRT4+/KRT13+) (Braga et al., 2019; Garc\u00eda et al., 2019) . Efforts in mapping pathologic states have identified mucous ciliated cells (ciliated cells which co-express a number of genes typically associated with goblet cells and are more frequent in asthmatic patients (Braga et al., 2019) ), as well as novel pathological epithelial cell subtypes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Adams et al., 2019; Habermann et al., 2019; Reyfman et al., 2019) . In addition, region-specific differences exist in airway epithelial cell phenotype within the bronchial tree such that basal, ciliated and secretory populations in the nasal epithelium differ phenotypically (and maybe functionally) from their counterparts in the large or small airways (Braga et al., 2019; Deprez et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2011; Travaglini et al., 2019) . However, despite well-characterized structural and functional consequences of ageing in the distal lung (Navarro and Driscoll, 2017; Thurlbeck and Angus, 1975; Turner et al., 1968) , little is known about alterations in human airway epithelial cell composition or function between paediatric and adult tissue. The importance of age-related epithelial variation has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where functional differences in airway predisposition to viral infection and response have had a major clinical impact.",

To determine alterations in biologically functional gene groups, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the Hallmark gene sets from MSigDB (Liberzon et al., 2015; Subramanian et al., 2005) . In the paediatric airway epithelium, this demonstrated a higher expression of genes associated with interferon alpha and gamma responses. In adults, there was a higher expression of genes associated with TP53, TGF\u03b2 and Wnt-\u03b2-catenin signalling, as well as processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and glycolysis ( Figure 2B ). Although broad transcriptional similarities are expected within the same tissue between childhood and adulthood, these differences in gene expression may be functionally important. Quantification of TP63 + basal cells, MUC5AC + mucosecretory cells and FOXJ1 + ciliated cells in paediatric and adult tracheobronchial epithelium. Results are shown as a proportion of total cells within the epithelium (12,568 total cells for TP63, 9,651 for MUC5AC and 16,144 for FOXJ1). No significant differences were seen in a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test (n = 3 donors/age group; basal cells, p = 0.1; ciliated cells, p = 1; mucosecretory cells, p = 0.26).

(A) Cluster diagram showing the normalized expression of all 37 genes differentially expressed with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01 and a log2 fold change > 1.2 in six paediatric (months of age/sex; 12M, 14M, 18M, 41M, 83M, 106M) and six adult (years of age/sex; 58F, 60F, 63M, 68F, 69M, 72M) laser-capture microdissected tracheobronchial epithelial samples. Values are scaled by row. Gene order is based on hierarchical clustering based on the similarity in overall expression patterns. Red represents relative expression higher than the median expression and blue represents lower expression. (B) Pathway analysis was performed on the same paediatric and adult laser-capture microdissected tracheobronchial epithelial samples using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to interrogate Hallmark pathways from MSigDB. For pathways with FDR < 0.05, normalized enrichment scores are shown. A negative score (blue) represents upregulation of the pathway in the paediatric samples; a positive score (red) represents upregulation in the adult samples.",

We used FACS to isolate EpCAM + /PDPN + basal cells (Miller et al., 2018; Weeden et al., 2017) directly from tracheal biopsies and performed bulk RNA sequencing. Consistent with successful purification of basal cells, we saw enrichment for basal cell-associated gene expression in this dataset compared to the laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium ( Figure S5A ). Using DESeq2 with an FDR of 1% and log2 fold change threshold of 1.2, we identified 32 genes with significant differential expression between basal cells sorted from paediatric and adult donors, of which 7 were upregulated in children and 25 were more highly expressed in adults ( Figure 5A ; Table S3 ). NTRK2 has previously been associated with basal cell function as it was upregulated in polyp versus non-polyp basal cells in human nasal basal epithelial cells (Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018) . Here, it was upregulated in adult compared to paediatric basal cells, consistent with a possible negative influence on basal cell progenitor function. However, the majority of differentially expressed genes do not have previously described roles in airway basal cells. GSEA suggested that pathways such as TNF\u03b1 and MTORC1 signalling, as well as processes such as inflammation and apoptosis, were higher in paediatric basal cells although all pathways were of borderline statistical significance ( Figure   5B ).",

We performed bulk RNA sequencing on cultured basal cells that were isolated and expanded on 3T3-J2 mouse embryonic feeder cells in epithelial cell culture medium containing Y-27632. As expected, cultured cells were enriched for basal cell-associated gene expression compared to laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium ( Figure S5A ). Freshly sorted basal cells were more similar to laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium than cultured basal cells ( Figure   S5B ), emphasising the significant impact of the artificial cell culture environment on the basal cell transcriptome. Using DESeq2 with an FDR of 1% and log2 fold change threshold of 1.2, we identified 983 genes with significant differential expression between basal cells sorted from paediatric and adult donors, of which 554 were upregulated in children and 429 were more highly expressed in adults ( Figure 5C ; Table S3 ).

At the level of the whole epithelium, there was broad conservation of airway epithelial transcriptional programmes but notable differences in the expression of genes associated with interferon responses and cell proliferation, which we speculate may lead to functional differences in cellular behaviour. In support of this, epithelial cell culture showed that basal cells from children have a greater colony forming capacity than those from adults. These data are consistent with studies in other epithelia, where ageing reduces the proportion of cells identified as stem cells using in vitro methodologies (Barrandon and Green, 1987) . Such differences in clonal potential and proliferative capacity of basal cells between children and adults might be responsible for their differing repair responses following airway injury (Smith et al., 2013) , and is of relevance for lung regenerative medicine. For example, paediatric cells might be more amenable to engraftment following transplantation, as is the case in bone marrow transplantation, where donor age significantly affects outcomes (Kollman et al., 2001) .",

This would be consistent with paediatric cultures being more proliferative and typically proliferating for longer time periods than their adult counterparts in population doubling assays.

Airway basal cells might be candidates for in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2, which would minimize issues arising as a result of physiological differences with cell lines derived from other organs and/or species (Poon et al., 2005) . Although we detected transcripts for genes associated with viral uptake in 2D primary cultured human tracheobronchial basal cells, other studies have shown that airway basal cells in another medium composition do not express ACE2 protein (Aguiar et al., 2020) so this requires validation at the protein level. Nevertheless, cell culture conditions alter basal cell gene expression more significantly than inter-patient variability (Butler et al., 2016) , so comparing ACE2 protein expression across basal cell culture systems might be of interest. Basal cells can also be differentiated towards mucosecretory and ciliated lineages in scalable air-liquid interface or organoid (Sachs et al., 2019) cultures that contain the cellular lineages thought to be targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in patients, suggesting these for use in viral infection studies (Jonsdottir and Dijkman, 2016; Pizzorno et al., 2020) .",
