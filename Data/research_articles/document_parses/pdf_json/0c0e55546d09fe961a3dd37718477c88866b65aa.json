The simulation model used consists of a nanoparticle impacting on a substrate at different angles and velocities. The material selected for the substrate and the sprayed particle is Copper (Cu). The substrate is rectangular and contains approximately 100,000 atoms having a size of 140 \u00c5 x 140 \u00c5 x 60 \u00c5. The particles used for the simulation are assumed to be spherical, having a size of 20 \u00c5. The lattice constant of both the substrate and the sprayed nanoparticles is 3.615 \u00c5.

In the simulation process of these two cases, the particle is equilibrated for one picosecond (ps), and the bulk temperature is kept in the range of 300 K. During equilibration, the particle does not gain velocity. In the next step, the particle is impacted by velocity, and the process goes on for 100 ps to observe the particle deformation.

However, the results of this study are obtained using many combinations of process parameters, which shed light on the molecular scale mechanisms involved in the CS process. Figures 3 and 4 show the simulation screenshots of the particle impacting the substrate. It is observed from the figure that the particles achieve higher deformation when impacted with 500 m/s velocity. The deformation is lower for 300 m/s due to lower kinetic energy and the rebounding effect observed for lower velocity impacts. The higher impact velocities show higher flattening of the particle, which can be attributed to the fact that increasing impact velocities increase the flattening of the particle [25] . It is observed through the simulation screenshots that the particle undergoes higher flattening when the impact angle is 60\u00b0. However, the particle adhesion is higher when the impact angle is 90\u00b0.

The stress distribution is observed using three different impact velocities, including 300 m/s, 400 m/s, and 500 m/s.

Figure 5a shows moderate traces of compressive residual stresses and high tensile stresses on the right edge of the deformed particle. Figures 5b and 5c have a larger stress distribution area compared to Figure 5a . It is due to the high kinetic energy of the particle and deeper impact in case of increasing impact velocities. The study observes that the atoms in the stress distribution region of 400 m/s impact velocity show higher magnitudes of compressive residual stress than the stress distribution region of 500 m/s. From these observations, it can be considered that the particle having 400 m/s impact velocity is better than the 500 m/s impact velocity because higher compressive residual stresses are beneficial for the strength of the substrate [35] .

This observation is similar to the observation in the case of 60\u00ba impact angle.
