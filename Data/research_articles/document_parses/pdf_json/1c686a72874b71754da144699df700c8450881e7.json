In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM 10 , NO 2 and SO 2 ) in Sal\u00e9 city (North-Western Morocco) during the lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM 10 , SO 2 and NO 2 was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the lockdown period were respectively 75%, 49% and 96% for PM 10 , SO 2 and NO 2 .

However, Wang et al. (2020) argued that the severe air pollution events would not be avoided by reducing anthropogenic activities (traffic and industrial activities) during Covid-19 outbreak, particularly when meteorology is unfavourable. While the cities' lockdown could significantly improve the air quality, its effect may differ considerably across different types of cities. He et al. (2020a) find that more industrialized and colder cities experienced larger reductions in air pollution levels. Furthermore, Croitoru and Sarraf (2017) reported that the rigorous options to reduce the ambient air pollution in most Moroccan cities depending on the emission sources. For instance, air pollution from the transport sector can be decreased through the improvement of the transport system and/or promoting alternative modes of transport. Nevertheless, they highlighted that such options, among others, need to be carefully considered and adapted to the context of each city. PM 10 , NO 2 and SO 2 are very common ambient air pollutants in urban environments and various studies carried out have demonstrated their severe health-related problems like respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, blood pressure, and lung cancer (Koken et al., 2003; Le Tertre et al., 2002) . These regulated pollutants arise from anthropogenic sources, including road traffic (e.g., motor exhaust; brake, wear and road erosion; resuspension due to wheel-generated turbulence) and industrial activities (e.g., metal processing industry and waste management) (Thorpe and Harrison, 2008; He et al., 2020b) . Besides the above emission sources, long-range pollution also plays an important role in certain worldwide countries. In Morocco, Benchrif et al. (2018) underlined the predominant influence of the trans-boundary pollution onto the northern cities air quality.

For the present study, the variations in SO 2 concentrations were not higher compared to those of PM 10 and NO 2 because: i) its levels appeared quite variable and significantly have decreased since the use, in 2009s, of fuel and lubricant oil with low sulphur contents; ii) commercial ships and incineration activities (industrial zone and pottery complex around the sampling site) closures due to pandemic prevention and control actions contribute significantly in the reduction of SO 2 emissions. The pattern of PM 10 , derived principally from road traffic, industrial exhaust emissions, construction works and dust entrainment, can presumably reflect rapid decrease of traffic density and decline of the urban particulate emissions from a number of local sources. However, the back trajectory analysis portrayed that air quality in Sal\u00e9 urban area is mainly affected by PM originating from the Mediterranean Basin (characterized by marine vessel emissions out of Western Europe and Northern Africa), local continental and from the near Atlantic Ocean (affected by pollutants emitted from the Iberian coast).
