In the outpatient study, over a median 30.0 (19.0 -40.0) days after testing positive, 12.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19. In propensity score-matched analyses, neither ACE inhibitors (HR, 0.77 [0.53, 1.13], P = 0.18), nor ARBs (HR, 0.88 [0.61, 1.26], P = 0.48), were significantly associated with risk of hospitalization. In analyses stratified by insurance group, ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, were associated with a significant lower risk of hospitalization in the Medicare group (HR, 0.61 [0.41, 0.93], P = 0.02), but not the commercially insured group (HR: 2.14 [0.82, 5.60], P = 0.12; P-interaction 0.: medRxiv preprint inpatient study, 14.2% died, 59.5% survived to discharge, and 26.3% had an ongoing hospitalization. In propensity score-matched analyses, neither use of ACE inhibitor (0.97 [0.81, 1.16]; P = 0.74) nor ARB (1.15 [0.95, 1.38]; P = 0.15) was associated with risk of in-hospital mortality, in total or in the stratified analyses. Conclusions: The use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was not associated with the risk of hospitalization or mortality among those infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there was a nearly 40% lower risk of hospitalization with the use of ACE inhibitors in the Medicare population. This finding merits a clinical trial to evaluate the potential role of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of hospitalization among older individuals, who are at an elevated risk of adverse outcomes with the infection. : medRxiv preprint 4 BACKGROUND Whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates or exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. 1 Experts have postulated, based on the effect of the drugs and the",

For example, we modeled the receipt ACE inhibitor or another other anti-hypertensive (excluding ARB) to determine each patient's likelihood of receiving these agents based on their measured clinical characteristics. We applied this strategy to different pairs of treatment comparisons (ACE inhibitor vs others, ARB vs others, and ACE inhibitor vs ARB).

Also, interestingly, we did not find the same association for ARBs despite clinical equipoise in the use of these drugs. Our findings are consistent with prior evidence from randomized clinical trials that a reduced risk of pneumonia with ACE inhibitors that is not observed with ARB. 5 Our study of in-hospital outcomes adds to the literature on studies that have reached contrasting conclusions regarding the role of ACE inhibitor therapy and inhospital mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We did not find a significant association with mortality, consistent with others that have not found such an association. 4, 23, 24 However, our findings contrast with certain studies that have found lower mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with ACE inhibitors. 7, 22 Notably, the studies that have evaluated mortality risk with COVID-19 before have not consistently been designed to detect potential causal association of drug therapy with outcomes, 7 relied on case control designs, 22 pursued potentially biased assessment by using comparators not receiving any therapy, 4, 7 or are based on data from single health centers. 4,23 Moreover, some have studied both ACE inhibitors and ARBs together despite potentially different mechanisms and effects on patient outcomes. 5 There some rationale for why there may be a specific ACE inhibitor effect. There is preclinical evidence that suggests a possible protective role for ACE inhibitors in COVID-19. ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, are associated with the upregulation of ACE-2 receptors. 3, 25 These receptors modulate the local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system interactions in the lung tissue. 26 The presence of ACE2 receptors, therefore, exerts a protective effect against the development of acute lung injury in infections with SARS coronaviruses, which lead to dysregulation of these mechanisms and endothelial .

Instead, our study evaluates the association of only pre-hospital factors with patient outcomes during hospitalization.In conclusion, the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs was not associated with the risk of hospitalization or mortality among those infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there was a nearly 40% lower risk of hospitalization with the use of ACE inhibitors in the Medicare population. This finding merits a clinical trial to evaluate the potential role of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of hospitalization among older individuals, who are at an elevated risk of adverse outcomes with the infection.",
