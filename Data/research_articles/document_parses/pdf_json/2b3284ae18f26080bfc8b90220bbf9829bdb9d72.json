We have followed the S. J. Challacombe et al. dosing protocols as accurately as possible (to standardise the dosing), and we anticipate the that the product will be available mid-May, initially in a 5L presentation, primarily for dentists, while a nasal and throat spray will follow in late May primarily for pre-procedural use in the hospital setting. While it cannot now be claimed that my position is unbiased, I can claim my intention from the start of this project was to find a low cost intervention to potentially break the link of patient to healthcare worker transmission. It has been very pleasing to have one's research intention and findings validated by S. J. Challacombe et al., amongst others, and it is these validations that have motivated and enabled the speedy provision of ready to use povidone iodine for dentists and for preprocedural applications in the hospital setting. Following an intensive exploration regarding the use of Videne as a potential product, we came to the conclusion that it is preferential to completely avoid phenol, a component of Videne, as this represents an unnecessary risk. We have therefore produced a product in partnership with a Pharmacy Specials NHS manufacturer, which contains no",

The first documented case of COVID-19 in our country was reported in late February at our very own hospital. As cases in our population grew the dental clinic went on an emergency only protocol and to date we have provided dental care to almost 500 patients and performed approximately over 100 dental emergency procedures. During this period we also had 11 patients who subsequently underwent COVID-19 testing for various non-dental reasons; later, two patient visits were verified as confirmed COVID-19 cases.",
