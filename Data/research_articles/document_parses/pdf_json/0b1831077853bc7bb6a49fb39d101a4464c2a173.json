The aim was to obtain a current picture of the population's expectations from self-driving (automated) vehicles. Twelve questions were asked to get an overview of the participants' opinions on the potential of self-driving vehicles regarding climate impact, time and monetary savings, the willingness to use automated vehicles, as well as their safety and risks. The results are compared to the current state of expert knowledge. The main finding is that the German population is skeptical towards self-driving vehicles. In comparison to a scientific perspective, the population is underestimating the potential and possible benefits of automated vehicles, while the risks are assessed similarly. In the conclusions, the findings of the studyare assessed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, the population's view on AVs is rather unclear. Therefore, a study on the topic \"Automated driving in a Smart City\" was conducted to obtain a contemporary understanding of how the population is feeling about automated vehicles. Within the study, a representative survey of 1,004 German residents was prepared and evaluated. The survey itself was run by forsa Politik und Sozialforschung GmbH, an established polling company in Germany. They performed computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) asking people to evaluate AVs with regard to their potential to increase the quality of life in cities, in terms of time and financial savings, and finally, regarding the reduction of traffic jams. Furthermore, the interviewees were asked to give their opinion about the AVs' safety and eco-friendliness, and to state whether or not they would be willing to use a self-driving vehicle. In addition to the responses to these questions, sociodemographic features were collected, including gender, age, level of education, and size of residence. Concurrently, the topics of the questions were analyzed by performing an in-depth literature review. Thereby, the results of the citizen survey could be compared to the latest state of expert knowledge.",

It is estimated that the cost of an AV will be 3,000-6,000 US$ higher than that of a conventional car [5] . Due to this higher up-front investment, it is more probable that people will prefer a short rental over purchase of an AV. A counterargument against the third scenario is that the possible positive aspects of self-driving vehicles will be undone if the usage of small vehicles for individual mobility increases, simply due to the high additional congestion caused by those cars. Thus, it is assumed that AVs will rather be used where they complement an efficient public transportation system, as described in scenario 2.",

            "text": "Current scientific and professional expert knowledge tells that AVs can improve the autonomy of people with reduced mobility. People with disabilities or limited mobility, as well as the elderly and children, may be able to travel more independently in AVs because as they may not be depending on an accompanying person anymore [9] . An AV could also be called and used independently if the necessary equipment is installed. Another positive aspect is that AVs can increase the safety of non-motorized road users. Since self-driving vehicles will obey the traffic rules and will keep an appropriate safety distance to other road users, e.g. cyclists or pedestrians, their subjective safety will be enhanced. This is possible because the current forms of motorized intimidation, driving too close, abrupt stops, and other user mishapswill be avoided [1] . Furthermore, urban centers with high traffic and residential density could be relieved. Due to the higher driving comfort provided by AVs, people may be willing to live in more suburban areas instead of the city center [2] . Important for this would be that the higher mobility demand is served by an overall efficient transportation concept that is sustainable, and thus includes not just AVs but also emission-free vehicles and a high-performance public transport system. Additionally, AVs can cause a reduction of parking space. If scenario 2 comes true, the space needed for parked vehicles will be significantly lower than today. In Germany, only 9% of the current vehicle fleet is used at peak hours [17] . By reducing the amount of vehicles, the space that is currently occupied for parking will decrease. In addition, special automated valet parking garages may arise, in which an AV would not occupy more than one quarter of the space a conventional car would need. This is possible, because the space for the access roads and ramps, as well as the space around the car could be strongly reduced as security spaces can be removed, and no human (driver) needs to get in or out of the car. Besides, the ability to communicate with each other and with the infrastructure elements can lead to a smoother traffic flow. Thus, traffic-jams are less probable and the people will spend less time in cars for the same trips.",

With increasing age the willingness to use a selfdriving vehicle decreases. While 61% of the 18 to 29-year-olds can imagine using a self-driving vehicle, only 36% of the interviewed persons who are 60 years old and above can. The assessment of the matter from the scientific and professional experts' perspective reveals that societal acceptance is an essential prerequisite if AVs are to be used ubiquitously. As stated in Sect. 2, the realization of the first scenariowhere the ownership and use of AVs would be the same as with a conventional car todayis rather unrealistic. Market potentials will arise if economic advantages and safety gains become visible. If barriers of accessing and using the vehicles are kept small, acceptance of AVs may be expected to rise, and one of the scenarios 2 or 3 will come true. This implies that automobile manufacturers may need to adapt their business model, as sales volumes of automobiles may decrease and the manufacturers' role changes from sellers to service providers for e.g. car sharing. In this situation, the automobile manufacturers are lending a car for a limited period, and the users only pay for the ride. The automobile manufacturers are in charge of cleaning, maintaining, and refueling the vehicle. The current automobile ecosystem with OEMs, car sharing providers, taxi companies, and leasing or car rental companies would thus face significant change.",

Velocity peaks when driving in convoys, and the effective driving time can be reduced [2] . As a consequence, the capacity of roads could be increased by 40% in cities and 80% on highways when all vehicles were driverless [12] . Due to the better traffic flow and increased capacity, the number of traffic jams could be reduced. An intelligent routing system, where the vehicles are distributed according to the roads capacity, would further contribute to this gain in capacity.

The ambivalent survey results reflect this. How AVs will be used in the future is currently an open question, but many optimization potentials are strongly dependent on that. A smoother traffic flow and fewer traffic jams are only possible if a substantial amount of the vehicles on the road are self-driving. It is also estimated that trips with AVs will be relatively cheap [10, 15] . At the same time, the current advantages of the public transportation systems the possibility to read or to do something except for performing the driving taskwould also applicable for trips in a private vehicle if it were self-driving. If all the trips would be performed with smaller, individual AVs, the possible positive effects will be undermined, though, and rebound effects will come to pass. As a result, the advantages of AVs would be reduced. To counteract that, the attractiveness of public transportation systems needs to be increased such that the main trips are performed with mass transportation systems, and only a few with AVs for individual transportation.",

Furthermore, it would be required that any person involved gives their consent before his or her data are released [6] .

An essential outcome was that nobody, neither human nor machine, would be allowed to balance between lives in a dilemma situation. Hence, no rules or decision making processes can be programmed into the software. The same commission concluded that automobile manufacturers are liable for accidents that occur while driver assistance systems are active. Therefore, it has to be clear who is in charge while driving, the vehicle system or the driver. This information needed to be documented and saved at all times [6] .",

One option seems to be to use self-driving vehicles given their promises of higher safety. From that point of view, the use of AVs would be preferred. Though, it is important to note is that it still has to be proven that a driverless vehicle is safer than human drivers in a majority of the traffic situations, particularly in complex environments such as cities. Therefore, extensive real and virtual tests will have to be made to validate the system's performance. Only after that, the user acceptance will rise.",

A central outcome was, that the population is underestimating the potentials of AVs compared to the current opinion in the scientific community. Furthermore, differences in the answers were found that are connected to sociodemographic features of the interviewed group, with females in general being more skeptical towards AVs and their potential. At the same time, those questioned between the ages of 18 to 29 were more open to the new technology, and further assessed the potential of AVs more positively. The older the interviewed persons were, the more critical they were. Other sociodemographic features like the educational level or whether the person lives in rural or urban environments did not correlate to their answers, though. The only question where less deviations between survey respondents and expert knowledge were visible is the question about cyber-security. In general, it is possible that the poll showed a general skepticism towards robotic technologies and not specifically towards AVs.

            "text": "It should be noted that the study was conducted in 2019 before the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. During the pandemic, the worldwide mobility demand changed significantly, with a massive drop in passenger numbers in public transportation systems and shared cars. In sight of these circumstances, it is questionable, whether the survey results would still be the same, today. It is self-evident that mass transportation systems are used less, because it is hardly possible to keep the safety distance in a confined space. Furthermore, there are concerns about the cleanliness of vehicles. As an alternative, the usage of bikes and private cars are increasing. In many cities, roads have been transformed into pop-up pedestrian zones or bike lanes, such that those using the soft modes can keep distance from one another. During the pandemic, a scenario of individuals using small and shared self-driving vehicles instead of public transport may appear the most appealing. A reduction of the usage of car and ride sharing, as well as taxis and other mobility services is noticeable, though. An explanation might be that the population has doubts, whether the vehicles are disinfected properly. So, selfsanitizing capabilities might be a very relevant feature of AVs in the future. It should be considered, though, that overall mobility has shrunk by up to 40% temporarily during the pandemic, because people worked from home, schools and shops were closed, and private meetings were prohibited, all affecting any kind of transportation service. Hence, it is difficult to derive a clear change in the survey results from the behavior during the pandemic. While it is well imaginable that individual transportation in a shared AV could be more appealing now than before the pandemic, this conclusion cannot be made easily, as demand in shared vehicles has been dropping, too. Overall, it is likely that the skepticism towards the new technology and especially the concerns about the cyber security of AVs remain, and that any new features that appear beneficial in response to COVID-19 will not necessarily be met with enthusiasm only by the population. This insight that is clearly calling for a stronger involvement of citizens into the advancing AV design process applying co-creation approaches.",
