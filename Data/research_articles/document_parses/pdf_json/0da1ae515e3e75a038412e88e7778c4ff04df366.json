Production capacity is limited in many countries and the future course of the pandemic will likely continue with shortages for high quality masks and PPE in the foreseeable future. Hence, expectations are that mask reuse, extended wear and similar approaches will enhance the availability of personal protective measures. Repeated thermal disinfection could be an important option and likely easier implemented in some situations, at least on the small scale, than UV illumination, irradiation or hydrogen peroxide vapor exposure. An overview on thermal responses and ongoing filtration performance of multiple face mask types is provided. Most masks have adequate material properties to survive a few cycles (i.e. 30 min disinfection steps) of thermal exposure in the 75\u00b0C regime. Some are more easily affected, as seen by the fusing of plastic liner or warping, given that preferred conditioning temperatures are near the softening point for some of the plastics and fibers used in these masks. Hence adequate temperature control is equally important. As guidance, disinfectants sprayed via dilute solutions maintain a surface presence over extended time at 25 and 37\u00b0C. Some spray-on alcohol-based solutions containing disinfectants were gently applied to the top surface of masks. Neither moderate thermal aging (less than 24h at 80 and 95\u00b0C) nor gentle application of surface disinfectant sprays resulted in measurable loss of mask filter performance. Subject to bio-medical concurrence (additional checks for virus kill efficiency) and the use of low risk non-toxic disinfectants, such strategies, either individually or combined, by offering additional anti-viral properties or short term refreshing, may complement reuse options of professional masks or the now ubiquitous custom-made face masks with their often unknown filtration effectiveness.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The COVID-19 outbreak is straining hospital and general response resources in many countries. One supply issue that has attracted global attention is personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular, filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs; the desirable N95 type or otherwise widely used face masks), which are suitable for airborne pathogens filtration and used by millions of healthcare professionals and public responders. N95 type masks are made by various manufacturers under different trade names. The term 'NIOSH N95' relates to a filter efficiency rating that means the mask materials block about 95 percent of particles that are 0.3 micrometers in size or larger. PPE options and mask availability will likely remain challenging given the ongoing divergence in the medical and public responses, as well as the apparent different strategies and local availability between the G20 countries and the rest of the world often with fewer resources. This means additional alternative, perhaps only temporary solutions must be established for the reuse, refreshing or extended wear of face masks. This could reduce competition for newly manufactured masks and PPE, and also allow resource optimization for countries with limited access to primary supplies. For the use and reuse of masks we expect continuing differences between large scale institutional approaches, strategies ideally suitable for hospital environments, and methods that can be quickly applied locally by non-experts with limited resources, for example the wide use by the general public of improvised homemade face masks. One of these options is thermal sterilization based on multiple reports of the successful deactivation of viral material in the 70-75\u00b0C regimes with less than 30 minute exposure, but with relative humidity perhaps also being a beneficial factor [1] . However, the survivability and reliability of multiple face mask types and their ongoing filtration effectiveness under thermal conditioning is less well known.

It is important to distinguish between the momentary disinfection offered by alcohol contact and evaporation, and longer lasting effects that can be provided by less volatile active compounds remaining on surfaces. Hand sanitizer usually has only isopropanol or ethanol as the active compound, whereas a disinfectant spray usually has a low amount of an additional active constituent. Anti-viral properties are given by compounds such as benzalkonium chloride [10] , chlorhexidine gluconate [31] , or ionic substances such as citric acid or perhaps even EDTA, and likely also some anionic or nonionic surfactants that in essence have the ability to disrupt the viral envelope [32] . There is usually little distinction between their activity on enveloped (SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19) or non-enveloped viruses (for example the bacteriophage MS2 simulant), except some comments have been made that MS2 might be more stable than the SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, citric acid based buffer solution containing nasal sprays were quoted to reduce the titer of an influenza A Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) influenza strain by up to 3 logs after 1 minute contact time [32, 33] . Similarly, some oils, such as tea tree oil or oil of thyme are associated with good anti-viral properties [34] . For any use on masks and on surfaces that are easily touched, it is of course important to use disinfectants that are low in toxicity and are ideally found in existing daily use items.

However, there is evidence that some of the commercial N95 masks suffer in their filtration efficiency when 'soaked' with alcohol or IPA based disinfectant solutions, or similarly even under higher temperature steam environments [36] . This is due to their complex construction in terms of a hydrophobic or electrostatic layer that is relatively easily compromised in the presence of steam and concentrated alcohol solutions. However, we could also speculate that masks could perhaps be just surface sterilized with a carefully applied thin deposit of an active ingredient left behind from an alcohol solution, basically a top surface treatment rather than a deeper soaking. Such an approach could be seen as the most basic momentary refreshing of a mask for extended wear or shorter term reuse if conditions require such action; in principle no different than often using hand sanitizer. Of course, any disinfection will likely be limited to the immediate surface and not necessarily kill viral material trapped deeply within the filtration layers. Further, there would need to be cross-checks whether suitable filtration efficiency is in fact maintained, and whether a treated surface has indeed the expected additional anti-viral property. We speculate that this will be less of a concern for simple cotton or fabric-based masks that are now often seen with the 'do it yourself' approaches. For these and similar more forgiving surfaces, the thoughtful application of IPA based spray-on solutions containing some longer lasting anti-viral compounds may be one avenue to increase the beneficial nature of such face masks.

The exact anti-viral efficacy of specific compounds should be corroborated based on existing literature data, by additional bio-assays, or further established by our bio-medical and virology colleagues, and is outside the scope of our current study.

There is evidence that humidity will aid virus deactivation on stainless steel at elevated temperatures (up to 65\u00b0C) [37] , however, in the current study the optimal thermal and relative humidity conditions for viral kill efficiency were outside the scope. Our focus is rather on the materials aging behavior for which thermal oxidation and perhaps shrinkage or other immediate deformation could be important. Additional relative humidity is not expected to negatively affect polyolefins and related materials because they take up very little water and are not hydrolytically sensitive, but the mask filtration efficiency and charge carrier capability can be impacted by humidity [36, 38] . The most suitable thermal exposure conditions should be derived based on balancing the primary viral disinfection needs with material thermal aging aspects, mask filtration performance and fitting behavior after exposure, and the availability of dry heat, commercial climate controlled incubation chambers, or perhaps relative humidity controlled sealed ovens by added salt solutions (deliquescence) [39, 40] . From a materials aging point of view, in particular here for polyolefins, exposure conditions of no more than a day in the temperature range of 75 to 95\u00b0C are not expected to result in significant oxidation, even if inexpensive and weakly stabilized commercial materials are involved [41, 42] . Further, aside from an immediate response such as shrinkage or warping (some copolymers have lower softening points), thermal aging of polymers is often also of cumulative nature, meaning a total exposure condition can be composed of multiple successive exposure intervals [43, 44] . This means if a material can easily handle one day at 80 or 95\u00b0C, then one would expect a few repeated 1 h exposures at such temperatures to be no worse in terms of overall materials performance [43, 44] .

As with many other aspects of this pandemic, careful and informed compromises with of course individual preferences (including disinfectant choice) need to be pursued, as there are no perfect and zero risk solutions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 934, "end": 938, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1072, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Our results on thermal and spray-on approaches represent some forward looking opinions that should not be misinterpreted. Any use of thermal and spray-on disinfection on masks should be considered within the additional risks seen in the use of chemical disinfectants and mask fitting behavior after thermal reconditioning. Further, a surface spraying is not expected to kill any virus particulates trapped within the interior filter layers. Nevertheless, commercial masks embrace similar filter materials and design principles. Hence any conclusions on their reuse and filter performance are likely to be more broadly applicable.

Due to time constraints driven by the urgency of the COVID-19 situation, these screening studies should not be considered as comprehensive evaluations with any implied recommendations and guidance outside the scope of these efforts. The parallel work of other researchers is expected to complement our understanding of mask and PPE performance.
