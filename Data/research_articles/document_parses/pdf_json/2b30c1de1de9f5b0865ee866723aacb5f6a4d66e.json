This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to 26 hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and 27 ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit 28 morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-29 SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be 30 limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order 31 to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are 32 required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent 33 RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CL pro . 3CL pro is an attractive target for antiviral 34 therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle 35 cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify 36 inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CL pro . Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived 37 protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CL pro . This experimentally optimized reporter assay 38 allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-39 throughput compatible protocols.

COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and infected over 8 million 58 people and caused ~500,000 deaths to date (5). Current efforts to control COVID-19 are largely 59 focused on behavioral modifications such as social distancing and the use of masks (6). These 60 approaches attempt to slow the spread of the virus, but meaningful control of the virus will 61 ultimately be the result of a combination of efficacious vaccines and antiviral therapeutics (7). 62 63 Antiviral therapeutics aim to disrupt the replication cycle and reduce viral load in infected 64 individuals. Therapeutic development efforts have led to a number of candidate antiviral 65 compounds focused mainly on two essential viral enzymes, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 66 (RdRp) and the viral proteases. Remdesivir (GS-5734), recently FDA approved as an antiviral for 67 SARS-CoV-2, targets the polymerase to suppress hCoV replication by inducing termination of 68 RNA polymerization (8); however, the benefits of this drug in clinical trials and early use appear 69 limited (9). Another nucleoside analogue, \u03b2-D-N 4 -hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-1931), also 70 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 polymerase activity, likely via inducing lethal mutagenesis of the viral 71 genome (10). In addition to the RdRp, the viral proteases, which are critical to liberate individual 72 viral proteins from the polyprotein produced by initial genome translation, present another 73 attractive drug target. For SARS-CoV-2, lopinavir/ritonavir, a protease inhibitor combination, is 74 shown to interact with the main coronavirus protease, known as 3CL pro or M pro (11); however, 75 early clinical trial results with these compounds have shown no significant benefits to SARS-CoV-76 antivirals targeting the SARS-CoV-2 protease, 3CL pro (13-15). At this time, these newly designed 78 compounds are in the early stages of testing. Thus, the discovery of additional effective SARS-79",

We performed a transfection timecourse with SARS-CoV-165 2 3CL pro to determine an early, appropriate timepoint for sample collection (Fig. 3A) . At 12 hours 166 post-transfection, only a few GFP fluorescing cells are visible and fluorescent signal is just above 167 background (Fig. 3B) . At 24 hours post-transfection, green cells are visible without appreciable 168 background signaling (Fig. 3B) . At 48 hours post-infection, most cells produce a high GFP signal, 169 with some background fluorescence detectable (Fig. 3B) . We therefore selected the 24 hour post-170 transfection timepoint. To increase the sensitivity of our assay, we titrated the level of SARS-CoV-171 2 3CL pro transfected with CoV reporter 3; our goal was to maximize activation of the reporter 172 while minimizing the amount of protease available in the cell.

Based on these experiments together, we selected a 1:0.8 reporter-to-178 protease ratio for transfection and a 24-hour post-transfection end point as the optimal conditions 179 for our protease inhibitor assay using the FlipGFP 3CL pro reporter, CoV reporter 3. 180 181 Finally, we wanted to verify that our assay could detect drug inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro 182 with a known inhibitor.

Four concentrations of GC376, that did not significantly impact cell 184 viability compared to vehicle alone, were applied to cells at the time of transfection with CoV 185 reporter 3 and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro .

After optimizing screening conditions, we 204 demonstrated that our reporter was sensitive to treatment with a known coronavirus protease 205 inhibitor, GC376.

            "text": ", including ours, also have limitations. Our reporter utilizes the CoV 3CL pro 220 expressed alone; during a CoV infection the protease is only one of dozens of viral proteins present, and any inhibitors that may affect cross-viral protein interactions would be missed. Additionally, 222CoV infection induces significant cellular membrane rearrangements that transfection of the 223 protease alone does not. Thus, the subcellular access of therapeutic compounds to the viral protease 224 may fail to be reflected in our assay, and the effects of an identified protease inhibitor could 225 significantly differ when applied to authentic viral infection. Finally, although this plasmid-based 226 expression presents many advantages, it also necessitates further screen hit testing in the context 227 of coronavirus infection. Although the correlation between our reporter and inhibition of viral 228 infection was appreciable with the drug GC376, testing of more inhibitors is required to make 229 generalizable correlations between our reporter assay and viral infection readouts. 230231To have the greatest impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral needs 232 to be identified as early as possible. Countries around the world have taken drastic and necessary 233 steps to limit the spread of virus, yet infection rates continue to rise in some. An antiviral treatment 234 is unlikely to stop the spread of infection, but it is likely to limit the mortality associated with 235 SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is our hope that this reporter assay facilitates the identification of SARS-236CoV-2 protease inhibitor candidates to be rapidly optimized and translated to clinical use.237 238 MATERIALS AND METHODS 239 Cell culture. All cells were obtained from ATCC and grown at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. 293T cells were 240 grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine 241 serum, GlutaMAX, and penicillin-streptomycin. VeroE6 cells were grown in MEM supplemented 242 with 10% fetal bovine serum, pyruvate, NEAA and penicillin-streptomycin. For transfection, 24 243 hours before plates were poly-lysine treated and seeded with 293Ts. The next day, plasmid DNA, Opti-MEM, and TransIT-LT (Mirus) were combined using pipetting and incubated at room 245 temperature for 20min before being added to cells by droplet. 246 247 Plasmids. All constructs were cloned into the pLex expression vector using the BamHI and NotI 248 restriction sites and DNA assembly (NEB). Coronavirus 3CL pro expression plasmids (SARS-CoV-249 2, SARS-CoV, MHV, IBV, HCoV-229E) were generated using codon-optimized gBlocks (IDT). 250 The TEV control FlipGFP was designed to include a silent NheI restriction site ahead of the TEV 251 cleavage sequence and generated using a gBlock (IDT). The coronavirus 3CL pro FlipGFP reporters 252 (CoV reporter 1, CoV reporter 2, CoV reporter 3) were generated using forward primers containing 253 the cleavage sequences along with the initial FlipGFP reverse primer, and assembled into the NheI 254 and NotI digested control FlipGFP plasmid. DNA was transformed into NEB 5-alpha high 255 efficiency competent cells (NEB). Insert size was verified with PCR and purified plasmids were 256 sequenced using Sanger sequencing. 257 258 Imaging and Quantification. Cells were fixed with 2% PFA at room temperature for 20 min before 259 incubating in 1:10,000 Hoescht 33342 (Life Technologies) in PBS at 4 o C overnight. Images were 260 obtained using the ZOE Fluorescent Cell Imager (Bio-Rad). Quantification was performed using 261 the CellInsight CX5 (Thermo Scientific). 262 263 Cytotoxicity Assays. 24 hours before treatment, plates were poly-lysine treated and seeded with 264 293T or VeroE6 cells. The next day, media was exchanged for complete media containing GC376 265 (MedKoo) at the indicated concentrations using a constant level of vehicle (DMSO). After 24 hours of treatment, cells were collected according the CellTiter-GLO (Promega) and Viral qPCR. 24 hours before infection, plates were poly-lysine 270 treated and seeded with VeroE6 cells. The next day, the cells were washed with PBS before 271 infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 from BEI Resources in 2% FBS MEM 272 infection media at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 hour. Virus was removed and cells were then placed in 273 infection media containing GC376 (MedKoo) at the indicated concentrations using a constant level 274 of vehicle (DMSO). 24 hours post-infection, cells were collected in TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed 275 by RNA isolation. One-step RT-qPCR was performed with primers targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N 276 region (BEI) using the EXPRESS One-Step Superscript qRT-PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) on an 277 Applied Biosystems QuantStudio3 instrument. RNA was normalized using an endogenous Cooperative agreement #HR00111920008).
