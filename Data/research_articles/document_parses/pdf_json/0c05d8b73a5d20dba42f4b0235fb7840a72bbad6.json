The incidence of trauma-induced, moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia, according to the Berlin definition, could be as high as 45%. Its pathophysiology includes the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which propagate tissue injuries by triggering neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs include a DNA backbone coated with cytoplasmic proteins, which drive pulmonary cytotoxic effects. The structure of NETs and many DAMPs includes double-stranded DNA, which prevents their neutralization by plasma. Dornase alfa is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved recombinant DNase, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may therefore break up the backbone of NETs and DAMPs. Aerosolized dornase alfa was shown to reduce trauma-induced lung injury in experimental models and to improve arterial oxygenation in ventilated patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Aerogen (Ireland) will provide nebulizers to study centres at an estimated value of 28k\u20ac. After validation from its Scientific Committee, the TRAUMADORNASE study is supported by a 300k\u20ac grant from the French Ministry of Health (PHRCI-2017-S09). Severe trauma remains a major socio-economic burden worldwide [1, 2] . Indeed, it is the third cause of fatality overall, the first cause of fatality and invalidity in the 16-45 age group and the first cause of disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs). Aside from civilian and military trauma cases, terrorist attacks have added new threats [3] . While the first peak of trauma-associated mortality happens within the very first hours from exsanguination and severe central nervous system injuries, secondary deaths are triggered by multi-organ failure (MOF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) [4] . The taxonomy of ARDS was recently refined by the last Berlin definition [5] , which also distinguished three levels of increasing hypoxaemia severity (mild/moderate/ severe) based on the ratio of partial arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) over inspired oxygen fraction (FiO 2 ). Patients who develop moderate-to-severe ARDS in the ICU have a worse prognosis compared to mild ARDS patients, including increased mortality rates (48% vs. 29%), impaired functional recovery, compromised quality of life and cognitive dysfunction [6] . Severe trauma definitely remains a significant risk factor for hypoxaemia, implicating both direct and indirect lung injuries [7] . Notwithstanding improvements in prehospital care, resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, the incidence of hypoxaemia in trauma patients has remained consistently high during the last 30 years [8] [9] [10] [11] . In the most severely injured trauma patients (Injury Severity Score (ISS) [12] above 15) requiring blood transfusion, the incidence of hypoxaemia may exceed 40%. Indeed, a recent analysis of the PROMMTT registry underlines that the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia could be as high as 45% [13] . In trauma patients, ARDS increases the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, incidence of ventilation-acquired pneumonias, healthcare-associated costs and mortality [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 310, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 311, "end": 313, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 583, "end": 586, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 881, "end": 884, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 959, "end": 962, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1413, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1545, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1746, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1750, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1755, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1760, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1841, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2062, "end": 2066, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2270, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Funding {4}"}, {"text": "Pathophysiology of trauma-associated hypoxaemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome As previously stated [7] , severe trauma may contribute to hypoxaemia by both direct injuries (lung contusion, aspiration) and indirect injuries (non-thoracic trauma, musculoskeletal injuries, haemorrhagic shock, transfusionassociated acute lung injury [15, 16] ). Whatever the mechanism implicated, inflammation is a key player [17] [18] [19] .
