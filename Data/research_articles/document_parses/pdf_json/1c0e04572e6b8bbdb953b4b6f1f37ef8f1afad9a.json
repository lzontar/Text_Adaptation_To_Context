Although most models predict a slowing in the death increase in the coming months and the reemergence of heart problems as the mortality leader, COVID-19 could be the number two cause of death for all of 2020, after ischemic heart diseases (IHD). Moreover, Osterholm suggested that we are in the early phase of the pandemic, and there could be 800,000 COVID-19 deaths in the US over the next 18 months. 3 In 1947 Dempsey stated that deaths do not tell the entire story regarding the seriousness of a disease, and she introduced the concept of \"potential years of life lost\". 4 A year later Greville stated the justification in simple terms \"from the standpoint of society, the death of a person in the prime of life constitutes a greater loss than the death of one of advanced years.\" 5 Since then years of life lost (YLLs) have been the subject of considerable research perhaps culminating in the Global Burden of Disease studies. 6, 7, 8 Furthermore, the initial metric, years of life lost, has been modified to include disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) in an attempt to account for the fact that not all life years are equal due disability.",

Three months of excess deaths and YLLs are bad enough but the model suggests there is a 33% chance of over 200,000 COVID-19 deaths in the US by the end of August. 15 Thus, there is about a 30% chance that by the end of August COVID-19 YLLs will equal or exceed those for IHD over the previous six months. Although we anticipate that IHD YLLs will be the leader for all of 2020, there may be a second COVID-19 wave and we are reminded of Osterholm's forecast that there could be 800,000 COVID-19 deaths in the US by the end of 2022. 3 Several factors may influence our YLL estimates and comparisons. The first factor is the accuracy of underlying cause of death numbers. The tallies of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for under-reporting. For example, the government counts 26,000 COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. But because the federal government is not requiring nursing homes to report deaths prior to May, the under-reporting of deaths at nursing homes could be in the thousands. 20,21 On the other hand, there is reason to question whether COVID-19 deaths are being over-counted because of higher payment for COVID-19 diagnosis in Medicare recipients. 22 In comparison, WHO reports that the relative uncertainty for deaths from IHD is about \u00b112% for high-income countries. 23 The second factor is using 2018 data for causes of death other than COVID-19.

We are well advised to pay attention to Spiegelhalter who wrote \"my cold, statistical approach is to wait until the end of the year, and the years after that, when we can count the excess deaths.\" 28 However, it is not merely an accounting exercise to understand the severity of the current health crisis even if such models are not totally accurate.

We need to be clear about the purpose of modelling. Models are never meant to provide exact numbers. Rather, by providing a range or a window of estimates for outcomes, including deaths, models serve the important purpose of guiding prevention and control measures as well as informing policy and planning regarding the disease modeled. Indeed, the COVID-19 Projections Using Machine Learning model makes a point estimate of the cumulative number of deaths by August 31",
