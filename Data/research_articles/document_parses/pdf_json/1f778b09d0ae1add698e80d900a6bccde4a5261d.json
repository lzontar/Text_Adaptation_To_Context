For this purpose, a magnetic device generating 7.5 T/m uniform magnetic field gradient was designed and incorporated to a commercial spectrophotometer. Different batches of colloidal superparamagnetic particles (SMPs), with different elemental compositions, were functionalized with twenty-mer complementary oligonucleotides, TB1 and TB2. When the functionalized SMPs-TB1 and SMPs-TB2 are mixed and incubated, the hybridization process of TB1 and TB2 occurs resulting in the formation of colloidal aggregates. When brought under the magnetic field, depending on the magnetic strength (\u0393) of the formed aggregates, they separate either faster or slower than the non-functionalized SMPs. The difference in magnetic separation time (\u0394t) is optically monitored by measuring the real time transparency of the suspension at specific wavelengths. The detection of aggregates at concentrations of 0.001% w/v was achieved, showing |\u0394t| ranging from 113\u2212228 s.

Biomarkers are very important as they allow early diagnosis and intervention prior to the occurrence of potentially serious clinical events. They can be used to establish the prognosis of patient and help to plan the treatment.

Within biomedical applications, magnetic separation enables the separation and isolation of targeted biological materials such as proteins, cells, small biomolecules from complex mixtures, by the use of superparamagnetic colloids. Generally, these superparamagnetic colloids present a spherical shape with sizes ranging from a few tens of nanometers to microns. These nanostructures, are commonly made by embedding superparamagnetic nanocrystals in a nonmagnetic matrix such as polystyrene or nanoporous silica [23] [24] [25] [26] . Other nanostructures consist of magnetic nanoparticles coated with inorganic materials such as Au, Ag or silica, resulting in core/shell nanostructures [27, 28] . Prior to their use as magnetic carriers, the surfaces of these nanostructures are modified, so that they bind to the targeted biological material in a solution to produce magnetic biological composites. In the particular case of genetic and pathogenic disease detection, the surface of the particles can be modified by grafting complementary oligonucleotides.

Fig. 5 -a shows the normalized UV-vis spectra (absorbance) of the MPs-TB2 and FeAu-TB1 suspensions of concentrations of 0.01% (w/v) and 0.02% (w/v), respectively. Fig. 5 -b illustrates the normalized UV-vis spectra of the mixture of both suspensions for different times of incubation. For the preparation of the mixture, 20 \u03bcL of MPs-TB2 suspension was mixed with 80 \u03bcL the suspension of FeAu-TB1. This proportions result in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL containing 0.002% w/v of MPs-TB2 particles and 0.016% w/v of FeAu-TB1 NPs (ratio \u223c 1:8). Three samples of the mixture were prepared and incubated for different times. The resulting UV-vis spectra show a red shift of the SPR peaks of \u223c15 nm and \u223c32 nm when incubation times are increased to 3 h and 20 h, respectively (Fig. 5-b) . A plausible explanation of the observed red shifts, is the spatial proximity between FeAu-TB1 NPs at the occurrence of the hybridization process on the surface of MPs-TB2 particles, as illustrated in the inset in Fig. 5b , providing an efficient optical platform for a strong near-field plasmonic coupling between the FeAu-NPs [3, 42] . The position of the SPR peak corresponding to the sample after 1 h of incubation time doesn't show any shift with respect to the UV-vis spectrum of FeAu-TB1 (Fig. 5-a) , which might be a result of the short incubation time. This is in full agreement with our previous discussion in section 3.2.1., where we pointed-out the nature's role of the different interactions between the functionalized MPs. At the beginning, a balance between the repulsive interactions between FeAu-TB1 NPs and the attractive interactions between FeAu-TB1 and MPs-TB2 would take place, resulting in a small number of FeAu-TB1 NPs attached to the surface of each MP-TB2. After one hour of incubation time, a new balance between the different interactions would be established; the hydrogen bonding between the bases A-T and C-G is likely to become dominant, resulting in an increased number of FeAu-TB1 NPs attached to the surface of each MP-TB2. The spatial proximity of the FeAu-NPs resulting from the increasing number of FeAu-TB1 anchored to the surface of a MP-TB2 leads to a strong near-field plasmonic coupling between the FeAu-NPs, which justifies the SPR peak shift to higher wavelengths, as can be observed in Fig. 5 -b [3, 42] . For magnetophoresis measurements, 100 \u03bcL of the mixture suspension were incubated for 3 h. Fig. 6 -a shows the separation kinetics of the mixture in comparison to the 0.01% suspension of MPs-TB2. The separation time t 50 of MPs-TB2 (\u223c 228 s) is shorter than the t 50 corresponding to FeAu-TB1/MPs-TB2 mixture, indicating that the formed aggregates FeAu-TB1/MPs-TB2 move slower than the MPs-TB2. This behavior will be approached based on the magnetic strength of the formed agglomerates. As discussed in the previous section, during magnetophoresis process, the aggregation of the particles depends strongly on the magnetic strength, \u0393. In the case of FeAu-NPs, based on their physical and chemical properties (saturation magnetization of \u223c5 emu/g, diameter of \u223c50 nm, calculated density of \u223c13.28 g/cm 3 , and the working concentration of \u223c0.016% w/v), the calculated value of \u0393 FeAu-NPs is \u223c0.69 (and N* \u223c 0.01), indicating a non-cooperative magnetophoretic process based on the individual motion of FeAu-NPs [37] [38] [39] , in agreement with the experimental magnetophoresis kinetics obtained for FeAu-NPs, showing separations times > 30 h when the suspension is brought under 7.5 T/m (not shown).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1337, "end": 1341, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1345, "text": "42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2455, "end": 2458, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2459, "end": 2462, "text": "42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3670, "end": 3673, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3674, "end": 3677, "text": "42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4690, "end": 4694, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4695, "end": 4699, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4700, "end": 4704, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 287, "end": 296, "text": "Figure S2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 782, "end": 791, "text": "figure S3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1237, "text": "figure S3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1354, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1511, "end": 1517, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2125, "text": "(Fig. 5-b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2348, "text": "Fig. 5b", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2632, "text": "(Fig. 5-a)", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 3660, "end": 3666, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 3771, "end": 3777, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Hybridization of FeAu-TB1 and MPs-TB2"}, {"text": "Considering the magnetic strength \u0393 for the different systems as follows:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hybridization of FeAu-TB1 and MPs-TB2"}, {"text": "\u2022 Magnetic strength of the MPs: \u2022 Magnetic strength of the mixture MPs + FeAu-NPs:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hybridization of FeAu-TB1 and MPs-TB2"}, {"text": "Where P is the number of FeAu-NPs bound to each MP.
