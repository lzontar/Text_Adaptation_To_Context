A controlled human infection model (CHIM) would accelerate the efficacy assessment of candidate vaccines. This strategy would require deliberate exposure of volunteers to SARSCoV2 with no currently available treatment and a small but definite risk of serious illness or death. This raises complex questions about the social and ethical acceptability of risk to individuals, given the potential benefit to the wider population, and as such, a study cannot be done without public involvement. We conducted a structured public consultation with 57 individuals aged 20-40 years to understand public attitudes to a CHIM, and pre-requisites for enrolment. The overall response to this strategy was positive, and many would volunteer altruistically. Carefully controlled infection is viewed as safer than natural exposure to wild virus. The prolonged social isolation required for the proposed CHIM is considered an obstacle but not insurmountable, with reasonable compensation and supportive care. Given the significant level of public interest, a CHIM should be done as open science with regular, controlled dissemination of information into the public domain. Importantly, there was a strong view that the final decision whether to conduct a CHIM should be in the hands of qualified and experienced clinician-scientists and the authorities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Controlled human infection with pathogens is increasingly used in research and development, despite the obvious ethical issues [1] and regulatory considerations [2] .

In normal circumstances, vaccine development is prolonged, averaging over 10 years from start to finish [4] . With unprecedented international scientific and regulatory effort and co-ordination, a COVID-19 vaccine could be available in a much shorter timeframe, but most realistic estimates put this at 18 months [3, 5, 6] . This timeline is in part due to the phase 3 clinical trials needed to prove efficacy, requiring thousands of participants and months of follow-up.

The number of participants enrolled is calculated to meet a statistically significant and public health-relevant change in clinical or microbiological endpoints, but is usually in the tens rather than the hundreds. This is in contrast to the huge cohorts of participants required in a population-based clinical trial. As multiple putative vaccines emerge over the next few months, as likely they will, a CHIM with SARSCoV2 would facilitate rapid 'ruling out' of ineffective vaccines. This alone would prevent wasted time and millions of dollars on large phase II/III studies of ultimately unsuccessful vaccine candidates.

Of paramount importance is self-determination of participants and rigorous application of informed consent procedures. At its simplest, it can be argued that provided each of these requirements is met and a fully informed volunteer gives consent to infection with a novel pathogen whilst understanding that he/she may come to harm, then a study is ethical.

In natural COVID-19 disease, most infections cause only mild to moderate symptoms and the level of asymptomatic infection is unknown. However, an estimated 20% of infections are severe [5] with an infection-mortality rate of approximately 2% in China [14] . The infection-mortality rate varies significantly between countries [15] which is likely due to differences in the availability of testing, as well as population characteristics and available health care resources. Severity and mortality are heavily weighted towards older age groups [5] and those with underlying health conditions. It is estimated that the infection-mortality rate (95% confidence interval) in 20-29-year-olds is 0.0309% (0.0138-0.0923) and in 30-39-year-olds is 0.0844% (0.0408-0.185). In contrast, the estimated infection-mortality rate in the over 60s is 3.28% (1.82-6.18) [16] . Apart from the risk of disease, another important consideration is whether the infection can be treated. A variety of anti-viral drugs and immunomodulators are currently being trialled, but none is currently proven [5] . Much of the mortality is a consequence of immune-driven acute respiratory distress syndrome [17] , and whilst prompt general support can mitigate this, there are well-described cases of mortality, even in younger adults despite intensive care [18] . Apart from risk to the individual, any proposed CHIM with SARSCoV2 will require isolation, and probably incarceration in a clinical environment for up to 4 weeks, to prevent harm to the participant and onward transmission to others.

Discussants were told that volunteers might be entirely asymptomatic but were more likely to develop mild or moderate symptoms during this period. Should this happen, they would then be admitted to a hospital clinical research facility and monitored as an inpatient with further tests and 24-h nursing. It was made clear that, in the event of illness, the clinical investigators would be unable to predict exactly the likelihood of development of severe symptoms and death. Specifically, it was suggested that the risk of death was in the range 1:100 to 1: 10,000. The discussants were told that payment for taking part in the CHIM would be in line with other recent CHIMs requiring an inpatient stay, amounting to approximately \u00a31000 per week.

When considering their own involvement as a volunteer, many expressed concerns about the personal risk, or the impact on, or risk to, family members or friends. Some stated that they would be unable to be involved due to their personal circumstances, but overall, a significant number would consider participation with the altruistic motivation of contributing to the greater good. It seems likely that it would be possible to enrol sufficient volunteers for such a study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "If a CHIM were to proceed, the complexities of the methodological and governance systems required to make the study as safe as possible are daunting. Investigators are rightly fearful of harming a volunteer. Apart from the deep remorse that would be felt, the reputational risk to the scientific field of controlled infection in the event of an accident or rare complication is considerable. Important considerations for the consent process have been highlighted. It is important to be as open and honest as possible about our lack of precision regarding the risks of symptoms, serious disease, long-term effects and death. Risks, and the level of uncertainty, must be expressed clearly and tangibly. The involvement of a psychologist in both the consent process and throughout the period of isolation would be essential. It was agreed that the level of public interest in this study would be high. All discussants felt that it would be important to inform the general public about the study and provide regular updates, both in order to maintain transparency and accountability and to ensure that public information about the study was accurate. However, crucially, the decision about whether or not the study should take place was felt to be one that the scientific community and ethical boards should make, rather than the public. This reveals the level of trust that the public has in medical research, but puts the burden of responsibility on the scientific community. For us, the investigators, this means that we must consult widely and engage with international qualified scientific colleagues before embarking on a CHIM. Such a study with SARSCoV2 will be complex, but possible, and it seems that the public would be supportive. In our view, the scientific community should seek to fund, design and set-up a study as quickly as possible, using an open science model to maximise public involvement, whilst also ensuring there is supportive consensus from scientific colleagues.
