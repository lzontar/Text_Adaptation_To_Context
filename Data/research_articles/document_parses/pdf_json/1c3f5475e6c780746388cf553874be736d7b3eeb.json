Numerous titles have been applied, including 'turista', 'Montezuma's revenge', 'Hong Kong dog' and 'Delhi belly' . One estimate is that 12 million individuals travel annually from an industrialized (Western) country to one in the tropics or subtropics; 43 in this group incidence of TD varies from around 20-50%. There is a highly signifi cant geographical variation in prevalence; high-risk areas include North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, South America, Mexico and the Middle East; intermediate ones include the north Mediterranean, Canary Islands and the Caribbean islands; low-risk ones include North America, Western Europe and Australia. In a retrospective study carried out in Switzerland, a large group of travellers were asked to complete a questionnaire after travelling abroad; incidence of the disease varied greatly, the highest fi gure (50%) being associated with travel to Tunisia. (No detailed study exists of TD acquired in a European country. 44 ) The disease tends to become less common with advancing years; it is unclear whether this is due to the fact that older travellers (\u226560 years) have a more discerning lifestyle, or whether relative immunity increases with advancing age. 38 Individuals resident for substantial periods in areas where TD is common seem to experience it less frequently than those not previously exposed. 38, 39 Clinical features TD is contracted by ingestion of contaminated water/food; it is characterized by acute-onset watery diarrhoea (usually of smallintestinal origin); 38-42 when colorectal involvement exists, diarrhoea is often bloody (see below). Abdominal colic, nausea and vomiting may be present; fever is unusual, being recorded in 1-10% of infected individuals. Prostration and resultant dehydration (with electrolyte imbalance) cause major problems in a severe case. Rarely, symptoms become chronic, and it seems likely that a small proportion of cases of TD proceeds to post-infective malabsorption (see below). 33 Unfortunately, for the investigator, by the time disease has become clinically overt, the initiating infection(s) has invariably been cleared. Chronic diarrhoea of lesser severity is a relatively common problem following recovery from acute disease; this can usually be attributed to (1) tropical enteropathy (in which there is major derangement of enterocyte structure and function) (see above) or (2) the irritable bowel syndrome (see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1607, "end": 1609, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1759, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1762, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2381, "end": 2383, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Traveller's diarrhoea"}, {"text": "On clinical grounds, an important differential diagnosis is infl ammatory bowel disease presenting for the fi rst time during, or immediately after, tropical exposure. 45, 46 In a retrospective review of UK residents presenting at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, London, with acute onset/bloody diarrhoea, the majority had infl ammatory bowel disease (usually ulcerative colitis); it was numerically more important than shigellosis and amoebic colitis. 45 Acute disease pursues an especially virulent course in certain high-risk groups, 38,39 e.g. those suffering from achlorhydria (Salmonella species and Vibrio species infections are known to be signifi cantly more common in this group), known infl ammatory bowel disease (see below), previous gastrointestinal tract surgery, a malignancy involving the gastrointestinal tract, and acquired or congenital immunodefi ciency (including immunosuppressive therapy and HIV/AIDS).

High protection rates (\u226590%) have been claimed for co-trimoxazole and the fl uoroquinolones; for trimethoprim a rate of around 50% has been recorded. Most cases of TD therefore possess a bacterial aetiology.

The role of prophylactic antiperistaltic agents is likewise controversial: action is unphysiological. It has been suggested that they can mask a more serious infection, e.g. S. typhi, although in this disease diarrhoea is an unusual presenting symptom (Chapter 52). By delaying excretion of pathogen(s) it is also possible that clinical disease is prolonged. In children, paralytic ileus is a major complication and has occasionally precipitated mortality. 50 Bismuth subsalicylate has a role in prophylaxis; the bismuth moiety possesses antimicrobial activity and salicylate antisecretory properties. 39 Early studies in Mexico by DuPont et al. 51 showed that, given as a suspension (the sheer bulk required precluded its use by travellers), this agent signifi cantly reduced TD; the same group, also working in Mexico, has demonstrated that, when given in tablet form (2 tablets 4 \u00d7 daily for 3 weeks, i.e. 2.1 g daily), a 65% protection rate can be achieved; 51 at half that dose, effi cacy was greatly reduced. The number(s) of pathogen-positive TD cases in a group of treated patients was seven of 29, compared with 35 of 59 in a placebo group; ETEC was present in 3 and 22, respectively, and Shigella species in two and eight, respectively. 51 A B-subunit/whole-cell (BS-WC) cholera vaccine has been shown to produce relative protection. 52 In a study involving Finnish tourists to Morocco, BS-WC induced 52% protection against diarrhoea caused by ETEC, 65% with mixed infection, 71% when ETEC was present with another pathogen, and 82% when ETEC and S. enterica were present concurrently. (Sack 48 has concluded that 'any advances in prevention and treatment of diarrhoea in travellers will be directly applicable to the worldwide problem of diarrhoea in children, which is far more important on a global scale' . This statement does not apply to this BS-WC vaccine, because protection only lasts for about 3 months.) A further approach under consideration consists of oral administration of colostrum-derived antibodies against ETEC. 39 A recent experimental investigation indicates that lactobacilli, which have the ability to adhere to the intestinal mucosa, can prevent E. coli colonization.

Historically, chronic diarrhoea accompanied by wasting was recognized in India before 600 BC; although the Englishman William Hillary is often credited with the fi rst precise description of tropical sprue at Barbados, 79 it now seems likely that he described either epidemic G. lamblia infection, or possibly strongyloidiasis. The clinical syndrome was well known to British physicians in India during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; most descriptions were made in British expatriate populations. It was in the early 1960s that reports of a high prevalence of epidemic PIM in indigenous Indians became available. 1, 76, 77 Despite early suggestions that chronic tropical diarrhoea had an insidious onset, it is clear (after careful assessment) that the vast majority of cases always pre-sented acutely. Confusion has been compounded further when acute epidemic cases of small-intestinal infection, associated with gross dehydration (in addition to xylose and fat malabsorption) and acute mortality, have been designated tropical sprue, as in numerous reports from southern India. 77 It is essential to include a time factor in the defi nition of this clinical syndrome, e.g. chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption, with weight loss, of at least 3-4 months duration. The term tropical sprue (if used at all) would be better reserved for a condition where malabsorption of nutrients is quantitatively more important than that of water and electrolytes.

The reason why only a minority of affected individuals who suffer an acute smallintestinal infection are susceptible to PIM is unknown; a genetic (or ethnic) basis for susceptibility seems likely. Table 10 .3 summarizes some of these. The role of parasitic infection has been highlighted by AIDS, in which prolonged diarrhoea accompanied by malabsorption and weight loss can be very troublesome. 37 Incontrovertible evidence exists that HIV itself causes chronic enteropathy with villous blunting; crypt hypoplasia results from a direct effect of the viruses on cell replication, or by an unknown immunological reaction. This is a very common cause of persisting malabsorption in Africa. In this context, Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli have recently come to the fore and it is now also clear that these organisms can produce a self-limiting illness simulating TD in immunocompetent adults and children (see below). G. lamblia (see below) is undoubtedly the most common cause of parasitic malabsorption. 74, 100, 101 Strongyloides stercoralis (see below), which is widespread in tropical countries, was until very recently still present in approximately 15-30% of former prisoners of war in South-east Asia during World War II; it is an underdiagnosed cause. 1, 102 Of all causes of malabsorption related to tropical exposure, intestinal tuberculosis -usually involving the ileocaecal region -is probably that with the lowest index of suspicion among medical personnel. 74, 103 Abdominal tuberculosis can assume several clinical forms: apart from the hypertrophic ileocaecal form, glandular (involving the mesenteric glands), peritoneal (sometimes with ascites) and hepatic involvement (with granulomatous disease) are relatively common. With the fi rst of these presentations, weight loss and diarrhoea are often accompanied by a lowgrade febrile illness; in severe cases stools are large, pale and bulky. Examination reveals an ileocaecal mass in 35-50% of cases, 103 and occasionally enlargement of one or more lymph glands; however, there is often no clinical abnormality. Late presentation can be as adult kwashiorkor. Anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia are common. 103 Chest radiography is usually normal. Absorption tests are frequently abnormal; fat and B 12 absorption are affected most severely. A protein-losing enteropathy may be present. Pathologically, the disease results either from miliary dissemination, or follows ileal ulceration. Malabsorption is caused by chronic bile salt loss; unabsorbed bile salts (normally reabsorbed in the terminal ileum) in turn interfere with colonic absorption. Barium meal and follow-through examination show ileal strictures, 103 frequently multiple, in a high percentage of cases; the ascending colon may also be shortened. The major differential is Crohn's disease, which is statistically much less common in people indigenous to the tropics. Yersinia infection should also be considered.

When the perforation is single, simple closure (with or without excision) is the procedure of choice; an area(s) of impending perforation should not be oversewn; closure should always be in two layers: an inner one of chromic catgut and an outer of silk. When there are three or more perforations, bowel resection is probably advisable. Peritoneal lavage with a copious amount of washing with normal saline should be carried out. The incidence of postoperative complications is high, and includes peripheral vascular failure, respiratory infections, anaemia, sepsis, abscess formation, burst abdomen and intestinal obstruction. 148 Re-perforation or a new perforation is possible. In a series of 108 consecutive cases of perforated typhoid enteritis managed in western Nigeria, 100 (93%) underwent 'debridement of the perforation and two-layer bowel closure'; 149 35 patients died, usually from overwhelming sepsis. In addition to specifi c chemotherapy, although chloramphenicol (1 g four times daily in an average adult, reduced to 1 g twice daily when body temperature is normal) remains the agent of choice, increasing numbers of reports of multiple-antibiotic-resistant strains of S. typhi are being reported (especially from India), metronidazole, and possibly corticosteroids, seem to improve the prognosis. Alternative chemotherapeutic agents include amoxicillin, co-tri-moxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofl oxacin; the last agent is indicated when there are serious doubts about sensitivity to the other compounds, as is frequently the case when infection has resulted in Asia. Despite these advances therefore, ileal perforation in enteric fever remains a potentially lethal complication, especially in children. 150 Haemorrhage is rarely life-threatening, although recorded; 151 whereas the majority of cases can be treated conservatively (blood transfusion when indicated), when selective angiography, fi breoptic endoscopy and high-resolution radionuclide imaging are available, localization of the bleeding site can be delineated and appropriate surgery instituted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 199, "text": "144", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 448, "end": 451, "text": "145", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 817, "end": 820, "text": "146", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 925, "end": 928, "text": "147", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 2537, "end": 2540, "text": "148", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 2769, "end": 2772, "text": "149", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 2773, "end": 2775, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3630, "end": 3633, "text": "150", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Typhoid (enteric) fever"}, {"text": "Abdominal discomfort (and pain) are common sequelae to heavy small-intestinal nematode infections (see above), especially ancylostomiasis and A. lumbricoides (see above), but serious acute complications (see above) are fortunately rare. 152 Anisakiasis, for example -usually acquired from ingestion of undercooked or raw infected fi sh (sushi and sashimi) -can present with an acute appendicitis-like illness.

Differentiation from invasive hepatic amoebiasis is usually straightforward, the patient being more severely and acutely ill; jaundice, septicaemia and renal impairment are common accompaniments. Ultrasonography is usually diagnostic. In Kuala Lumpur, 25 pyogenic abscesses were encountered between 1970 and 1985; 251 during the same period, there were 90 amoebic and one tuberculous abscesses, while in 89 others the cause of the abscess was not discovered. At Kingston, Jamaica, fever and abdominal pain were present in 21 (80%) out of 24 cases of pyogenic abscess encountered between 1977 and 1986; 252 the most common signs were right upper quadrant tenderness and hepatomegaly; leukocytosis, elevated alkaline phosphatase and hypoalbuminaemia were common. Reports from London 253 and California 254 have given encouraging reports of management by needle aspiration under antibiotic (usually gentamicin and metronidazole or clindamycin) cover. Another study has also recorded satisfactory results in 18 of 21 patients using this form of percutaneous drainage. Other authors have intimated, however, that this form of management should be reserved for selected patients. 255 A report from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has provided results which were less encouraging. In Jamaica surgical drainage using a guided percutaneous technique gave comparable results. 256 Taking all reports into account, it seems wise to perform a laparotomy and to institute surgical drainage as soon as possible after diagnosis. Using ultrasonographic control, a pyogenic abscess can be seen to 'resolve' signifi cantly more rapidly than an amoebic abscess. It should be appreciated, however, that this disease carries a signifi cant mortality rate; between 1975 and 1986, these authors treated 109 children with pyogenic liver abscess; the mortality rate was 15%. 257 There is limited (suggestive) evidence that the overall prognosis is improving.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 204, "end": 205, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1460, "text": "255", "ref_id": "BIBREF254"}, {"start": 1639, "end": 1642, "text": "256", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2125, "text": "257", "ref_id": "BIBREF256"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pyogenic liver abscess"}, {"text": "Only rarely, usually following trauma, does hydatidosis 207, 258, 259 present as an abdominal emergency.
