            "text": "To study the role of N protein in coronavirus replication and transcription, we made use of our reverse genetic system for HCoV-229E. 3 We produced two vector RNAs, HCoV-vec-1 and HCoV-vec-GN, that both contain the replicase gene and the gene encoding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP). HCoV-vec-GN encodes in addition the N protein, whereas HCoV-vec-1 is lacking the N gene ( Figure 1a) . We previously showed that HCoV-vec-1 RNA mediates the transcription of a subgenomic mRNA, encoding GFP. 4 Thus, we concluded, that the replicase gene products suffice for coronavirus transcription. We also observed that only a small number of green fluorescent cells (< 0.1%) can be detected upon electroporation of HCoV-vec-1 RNA into BHK-21 cells. However, if a synthetic mRNA encoding the HCoV-229E N protein was co-electroporated into BHK-21 cells, the number of green fluorescent cells significantly increased (3.4%, Figure 1b ). When we electroporated HoV-vec-GN RNA into BHK-21 cells, we again could observe less than 0.1% green fluorescent cells, and elevated numbers of GFP-expressing cells could only be detected if a N protein mRNA is coelectroporated ( Figure 1b) . Thus, we conclude that co-electroporation of mRNA encoding the HCoV-229E N protein with HCoV-229E-based vector RNAs encoding GFP increased the number of green fluorescent cells, even if the N protein was encoded by the vector RNA (e.g., HCoV-vec-GN). We interpret these results that the presence of N protein early after transfection of vector RNAs is important in our system for the formation of a functional replicase/transcriptase complex. Although there was no difference in the number of green fluorescent cells after transfection of HCoV-vec-1 and HCoV-vec-GN RNA into BHK cells, we observed that HCoV-vec-GN-transfected cells displayed relatively intense fluorescence already 16 h post-transfection. In contrast, the intensity of green fluorescence of HCoV-vec-1transfected cells was lower and only became apparent 48 h post-transfection. To test whether this finding was related to different replication or transcription levels of vector RNAs, we analyzed the vector-specific RNAs in transfected BHK-21 cells by Northern blot. To obtain a sufficient number of green fluorescent cells that allow for the detection of vector-specific RNAs by Northern blot analysis, we co-electroporated synthetic N protein mRNA with vector RNAs HCoV-vec-1 and HCoV-vec-GN, respectively. After co-transfection of HCoV-vec-1 RNA with N protein mRNA, we could detect a faint signal for a subgenomic mRNA encoding GFP (data not shown). To increase the number of green fluorescent cells that have been transfected with HCoV-vec-1 and N protein mRNA, we sorted green fluorescent cells prior to the isolation of poly(A)-containing RNA. With this strategy, an HCoV-vec-1 derived subgenomic mRNA encoding GFP was readily detectable, but we were unable to detect the full-length HCoV-vec-1 RNA ( Figure  1c ). This contrasted with the co-transfection of HCoV-vec-GN RNA and N protein mRNA, where we could easily detect (even without sorting green fluorescent cells) the full-length vector RNA and two mRNAs encoding GFP and N protein (Figure 1c) . These results show that vector RNAs encoding a functional N gene were able to transcribe and replicate RNA, whereas vector RNAs lacking the N gene were able to transcribe RNA but replication of full-length vector RNA was not detectable.",

Accordingly, it is tempting to speculate that in natural infections, N proteins, associated with the viral genome in the ribonucleoprotein complex, may be important early in the infection to establish a functional replication/transcription complex and sustained N protein expression by the transcription of viral N protein mRNA may be required for efficient genome replication.",

As illustrated in Figure 2a , we modified the authentic TRS-N core sequence (UCUAAACU) to contain a stretch of three random nucleotides (UCUNNNCU). Thus, we constructed, by in vitro transcription, a population of 64 different full-length recombinant HCoV-229E genomes. These RNA molecules were transfected into BHK-21 cells (which are not susceptible to HCoV-229E infection), and after 3 days we isolated poly(A)-containing RNA ( Figure  2b ). By RT-PCR, we compared the sequence of the TRS-N region of the \"input\" genomes (in vitro transcription products) and the \"re-isolated\" genomes (poly(A)containing RNA isolated 3 days post-transfection).

The result of this analysis is shown in Figure 2c . We could detect an increased number of genomes that contained the authentic (wild-type) TRS-N amongst re-isolated genomes (increase from 4.5% to 9.8%). Similarly, we observed an increased number of genomes containing the uridine within the TRS-N (NNU; increase from 20.5% to 41.5%). These two groups obviously had undergone a positive selection during amplification in BHK-21 cells. Genomes that contained one nucleotide difference compared to the authentic TRS-N or leader-TRS remained approximately at the same level (31.8% and 29.3% for input and re-isolated RNAs, respectively). Genomes that contained sequences not matching to the groups mentioned above had presumably undergone a negative selection, because their percentage dropped from 43.2% in the input genomes to 19.5% in the re-isolated genomes.",

Again, the RT-PCR product was cloned, and the sequences of individual clones, corresponding to the sequences of subgenomic N protein mRNAs at the leader-body fusion sites, were determined. As expected, most N protein mRNAs (> 60%) contained either, the authentic TRS-N sequence (UCUAAACU) or the sequence of the leader TRS (UCUCAACU), confirming that these TRS elements were efficient in directing the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. In addition to these wild-type TRS elements, we could determine nine different N protein mRNA sequences. As shown in Figure 2d , eight of these subgenomic N protein mRNA sequences match with genomes that contain either the NNU sequence at the TRS-N (group of positively selected genomes) or only one nucleotide difference compared to the TRS-N or leader TRS (group of genomes that remained on the same level in our assay).

Thus, our data provide substantial evidence for a functional role of the N protein in coronavirus RNA synthesis.

Future studies are needed to elucidate at which process(es) the N protein interferes in coronavirus RNA synthesis (e.g., initiation of negative-strand synthesis, recognition of TRS elements, regulation of replication/ transcription levels) and how these function(s) are mediated (e.g., interaction with viral RNA, replicative proteins, or host cell proteins).
