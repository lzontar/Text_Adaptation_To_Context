Such measures impose harmful burdens on the population and the global economy, 11 and are difficult to tolerate during extended periods. 1 Therefore, evaluating alternate NPIs that could be implemented at this stage and potentially avoiding a second epidemic peak and lockdown is urgently needed. 12, 13 To face the epidemic, France ordered on March 17 all nonessential retailers and services to close, and the general population to stay confined at home and to adhere to social distancing when outside of home for important personal needs. These measures have been successful in reducing the number of incident cases and the strain on the healthcare system, and the French government has announced a lockdown lifting on May 11th.

Because the model included 500,000 individuals approximating 67 million people from the general population, the maximum possible precision was \u00b1134 individuals. Therefore, KS tests were performed after correcting the observed data with the available precision, i.e. dividing and rounding the modeled and observed data by the precision. We also compared the model-predicted and observed age distribution among deceased people using both a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and visual comparison.

It further predicts more than 200,000 deaths if no specific mitigation measures are planned at the time of quarantine lifting.

It was assumed that individuals with no or light symptoms (such as stomach pain or nausea) were not diagnosed, except if they were traceable contacts (i.e., intrafamilial, work, school) of diagnosed patients, and that all individuals with mild, severe, or critical symptoms were diagnosed. To reflect these assumptions, among infected individuals, the probability of being asymptomatic or lightly symptomatic in the model was set at 95% in children aged less than 10 years, since very few children have been diagnosed with COVID-19, 7 and was assumed to decrease linearly with age.
