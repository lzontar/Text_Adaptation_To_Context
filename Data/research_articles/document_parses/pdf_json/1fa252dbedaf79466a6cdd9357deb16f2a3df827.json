Based on the dynamical characteristics and traditional physical models, we construct several new bidirectional network models of spreading phenomena. By theoretical and numerical analysis of these models, we find that the collective behavior can inhibit spreading behavior, but, conversely, this spreading behavior can accelerate collective behavior. The spread threshold of spreading network is obtained by using the Lyapunov function method. The results show that an effective spreading control method is to enhance the individual awareness to collective behavior. Many real-world complex networks can be thought of in terms of both collective behavior and spreading dynamics and therefore to better understand and control such complex networks systems, our work may provide a basic framework.

In the stock market, the prices of different stocks will increase or decrease synchronously if relevant political canard spreads. Conversely, the price fluctuation also influences the spreading of relevant political canard. With the fast spread of an infectious disease in society, the times of avoiding assemblage and washing hand, etc., of people will increase in a synchronous way to protect themselves. On the other hand, this synchronous response will weaken the disease spread to some degree. In order to precisely control these collective and spreading behaviors and understand their interplay from the viewpoint of mathematics, the first step should be the construction of a suitable model which can display similar properties for these real dynamical networks. So, in this work, we will provide some mathematical models and address correlation between the collective and spreading dynamics on complex networks. The research results show that our models correspond closely with many real dynamical complex networks, and an effective spreading control method is to enhance the individual awareness to collective behavior.",

For examples, the daily activities of cows (eating, lying down, and standing) can be modeled by a dynamical network, where local dynamics of each cow is described by an oscillator of a piecewise linear dynamical system. 1 The authors in Ref. 1 not only studied interesting dynamics such as synchronization but also developed some biological predictions. Many other examples can be found in Ref. 2 . Now, let us ask: when an infectious disease spreads among these cows, what is the impact on their synchronous behavior? Can then this synchronous behavior weaken or strengthen the disease spread process? We feel that these problems can be resolved by examining the interplay between the collective and spreading dynamics on complex networks.",

            "text": "It is an interesting and important topic to consider the interplay between different dynamical behaviors appearing in complex networks. The correlation between traffic flow and epidemic spreading on complex networks was investigated numerically and theoretically in Ref. 3 , for the case where the epidemic incidence was shaped by traffic-flow conditions and epidemic pathways were defined and driven by flows. The results in Ref. 3 provided a general framework for us to understand the spreading processes on complex traffic networks. We have investigated mathematically the correlation between the dynamical synchronization and the epidemic behavior on complex networks, 4 and a very explicit condition for synchronization with respect to the epidemic rate was obtained. However, in this case, we only considered a special collective behavior, i.e., global synchronization. Moreover, the correlation between the dynamical synchronization and the epidemic behavior is unidirectional, i.e., the spreading behavior can influence the dynamical synchronization, but not vice versa. So, in this paper, we will extend our former research work to consider that the correlation between the collective behavior and the spread behavior is bidirectional and address further phase synchronization which may be a more general collective behavior. In this work, we first propose a general bidirectional model of collective behavior and spreading dynamics on complex networks in Sec. II. Then in Secs. III-V, two concrete models are provided and studied, respectively, corresponding to two collective behaviors of dynamical behavior network, i.e., global synchronization and phase synchronization. By using the Lyapunov function method, we investigate the spread threshold of spreading on a network. In Sec. VI, we investigate finally the control problem of spreading behavior and provide an effective control strategy.",

In real life, many dynamical phenomena can be described and explained by system (1). For example, when a political canard spreads, many relevant stocks will increase or decrease their prices synchronously for the explicit benefit of their corresponding corporations by closer communication. Conversely, the collective price fluctuation also accelerates or decelerates the spreading of relevant political canards. Similarly, when a certain infectious disease breaks out, people or animals will take some collective protective measures such as washing hands frequently, avoiding assemblage, resting frequently, etc. At the same time, these collective behaviors will further influence the disease spread. Fig. 1 gives a schematic diagram of three groups of collective and spreading behaviors which are interrelated closely, where the arrowhead shows the reliant relation between them.",

Nonetheless, this individual behavior is a manifestation of the individuals behavior (through, for example, wearing of face masks, modification of hygiene practice, sharing of utensils, and washing of hands), and this is something which can be observed by others. There is a collectivization in ones response-if more people are wearing face masks in public it becomes more acceptable to do so and one is more likely to follow suit: or vice versa. Hence, the dynamical behavior of this parameter /\u00f0t\u00de exhibits a synchronization which, in term, influences the disease dynamics. Now, we will address two basic properties of system (2), i.e., spread threshold of the spreading network and synchronization stability of the dynamical behavior network. By using a similar analytical method presented in Ref. 7, we can obtain easily that the spread threshold is",

First, we consider that the spreading network and dynamical behavior network having the same network topological structure. This implies that the individuals in the spreading network and dynamical behavior network are identical. For example, when human disease spreads, the reactive collective behaviors of washing hand, avoiding assemblage, etc., are also generated by people within the community. The network structure embedded in model (2) is set to be the BA network 9 with size N \u00bc 200. This network evolves from initial network with size m 0 \u00bc 4 and we add each new node with m \u00bc 3 new edges. Other parameters are chosen as q 3 \u00bc 0:03; q k \u00bc 0; k 6 \u00bc 3 and r \u00bc 0:01; b \u00bc 0:001. Fig. 2 gives a simulation under k \u00bc 0:05; a \u00bc 0:5, where the spreading does not become endemic and synchronization is not realized. In this case, the individuals do not exhibit collective behavior since the spread will die out and its prevalence is too small to keep them close. By increasing the spreading rate to k \u00bc 0:3 in Fig. 3 , the synchronization is achieved and spreading also becomes endemic. Moreover, a very interesting phenomenon is that the total density I(t) is oscillating, which is also found in adaptive epidemic networks. 10, 11 If the collective behavior fails to influence the spreading, i.e., setting a \u00bc 1, then the total density I(t) will converge monotonically to a larger value. From this simulation, we can see that the collective behavior can inhibit greatly the spreading behavior.",

By increasing the probability p in WS smallworld network, we find the ratios K N =K 2 and hki=hk 2 i both decrease (see Fig. 8 ).

From Figs. 9 and 10, we can see that under fixed parameter a \u00bc 0.5, the change of network structure just plays trivial role in the spreading process, as the spreading prevalence I(t) does not vary obviously either in disease-free case or in endemic case (By performing simulations with more nodes, we have not found any essential difference to this simulation with 100 nodes. So, we can conclude the qualitative dependence of I(t) on p by this two figures). For other values of parameter a, the results are similar to this case. We can further observe this trivial influence in Fig. 11 , where the spread threshold k c seems fixed if the parameter a keeps constant. However, with the increasing of parameter a, the spread threshold k c is decreased greatly. Therefore, the awareness is a critical factor for the spreading control strategy, and an effective control method is to enhance the awareness to collective behavior.",

Two concrete models are studied, respectively, where the spreading behavior is controlled by traditional SIS network model and the collective behavior is demonstrated by global synchronization and phase synchronization. The spread threshold of spreading network is obtained by using the stability theory method, and it depends on the network structure and individual awareness. The synchronization manifold of the dynamical behavior network is globally asymptotically stable if the spreading network can achieve an endemic state. Moreover, some numerical simulations are given to verify these theoretical results. We find that the collective behavior can inhibit spreading behavior, but, conversely, this spreading behavior can accelerate collective behavior. Finally, we study the impact of the change of network structure on spreading dynamics and find an effective control of spreading behavior is to enhance the awareness to collective behavior. This work may provide a basic framework to better understand and control such complex networks systems.",
