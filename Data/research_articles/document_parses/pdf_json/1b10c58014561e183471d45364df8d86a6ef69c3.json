With shelter-inplace orders, outpatient clinics transitioned to telemedicine, and the threat of hospitals being overrun with COVID-19 patients, liver transplant programs have been faced with the challenge of balancing patient and staff safety while operating in a resource limited environment.",

Several societies have recently authored position papers and guidance documents framing how programs could approach these difficult decisions. 2-5 However, no federal regulations have been instituted to enforce changes to current policies. As a result, there may be variability in how individual programs have changed practices, even within the same region. We therefore sought to examine regional-and center-level changes in adult deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT) volume in the month before (February 2020) and after (March 2020) the inception of the US COVID-19 epidemic.",

Additionally, widely disparate center-level behavior in the same metropolitan areas (e.g., New York, Los Angeles) suggest that distance between donor hospitals and centers would not explain our results. The differences across centers more likely reflects different allocation and prioritization of hospital resources for COVID-19 relative to liver transplantation, center capabilities to rapidly test and rule out COVID-19 in recipients, and concerns with respect to donors (i.e., accuracy of donor COVID-19 testing), recipients (e.g., impact of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed transplant recipients), and transplant team members (i.e., risks of hospital-acquired COVID-19). Additionally, although data on expedited organ placements are not available, differences in center 'aggressiveness' in accepting organ offers, including those turned down by other centers, likely contributed to differences in center volumes. These numerous factors collectively influence the individual transplant program's perception of risk that drives variable behavior. It is impossible to know which approach is correct. Further data on waitlist outcomes, posttransplant incidence of COVID-19 infection, and survival outcomes in our LT recipients will undoubtedly help inform practical guidance and restore some order to this chaos.",

Due to the institution of the Acuity Circles policy on February 4, 2020, we included 2019 data to assure changes observed from February to March in each year was not a result of allocation policy change. We performed a series of analyses: 1) evaluated the correlation between region-level changes in deceased donors (procurement region) and adult DDLT's from February to March using Pearson correlation coefficients; 2) compared relative region-level changes in donors vs recipients from February to March in each calendar year (to determine whether the magnitude of change in donors and recipients within a region was similar in 2019 and 2020); and 3) evaluated center-level changes in adult DDLT volume from February to March in 2019 and 2020.",

Regions 2 and 9 performed more DDLTs in March of 2019 and 2020 relative to the change in deceased donors, while Regions 3, 4, and 5 performed less DDLTs than expected; and the magnitude of this change was similar in 2019 and 2020. In contrast, although Regions 1, 8, and 10 had fewer DDLTs from February to March in 2019, this decrease in DDLT relative to donors was much more pronounced in 2020 (-5 to -13, -8 to -15, and -9 to -35, respectively). Finally, while Regions 7 and 11 had fewer DDLTs than expected given the change in donors from February to March in 2019, there was significantly more DDLTs than expected in 2020 (-6 to +9, -3 to +9, respectively). Center-level changes in DDLT volume from February to March revealed a significant increase in intraregional variability in 2020, evidenced by a wider interquartile range and overall range in 8 of 11 UNOS regions (Figure 1d; data on 113 transplant centers in Figure 1e). When examining the center-level changes in the number of DDLTs from February to March year-to-year, 69 of the 113 centers (61%) nationally had a difference of \u22645 between 2019 and 2020 (e.g., a center performing 2 fewer DDLTs from 2/19-3/19 and 2 more DDLTs from 2/20-3/20 would have an absolute difference of 4 between 2019 and 2020). Forty-four centers (39%) had a difference of \u22656 between 2019 and 2020, of which 32 (72.7%) had a decrease in DDLT volume from February to March in 2020 but no decrease in 2019 (blue box in Figure 1e), while the other 12 (27.3%) had an increase from February to March 2020, of which 10 had a decrease during the corresponding period in 2019. The widewithin-region variability in center practice was seen in both high-COVID regions (e.g., Region 9, NY) and low-COVID regions (e.g., Region 4, Texas and Oklahoma) based on the number of confirmed COVID cases.

            "text": "The negative impact of COVID-19 on our LT practice has been unequivocal, reflected in the significant decrease in the number of deceased donors and DDLT from February to March of 2020, compared to a comparative increase in both during the same 1-month period in 2019. While changes in regional donors were highly correlated to the number of DDLTs in 2019, there was poor correlation in 2020. This lack of correlation in 2020 is unlikely to be due to the recent change in allocation policy, since the February to March comparisons in 2019 and 2020 operated under the same allocation rules in each year.A detailed analysis of center-level changes in DDLT volume reveals much greater variability in 2020 within the same region, which ostensibly have similar prevalence of COVID-19. This unpredictable chaos in center behavior is perhaps best highlighted looking at center-specific changes in volume. Even utilizing a high threshold (\uf0b36) of what may be considered a significant change in practice between 2019 and 2020, nearly 40% of the transplant centers displayed a February to March change in DDLT volume in 2020 that was opposite to their 2019 behavior. Perhaps more interesting was 10 of the 12 centers with a significant increase in DDLT volume in the COVID era had a decrease in DDLT volume from February to March of 2019. This phenomenon cannot be explained by the local COVID prevalence since each of these centers had neighboring programs which significantly decreased their DDLT volume.",
