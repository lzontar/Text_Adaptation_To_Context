Moreover, in this global crisis, worldwide activities and businesses are heavily dependent on digital technologies [4] , Nasir Saeed, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, and Mohamed-Slim Alouini are with King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal 23955-6900, Saudi Arabia (e-mail: nasir.saeed@kaust.edu.sa; tareq.alnaffouri@kaust.edu.sa; slim.alouini@kaust.edu.sa). Ahmed Bader is with Insyab Wireless Limited, Dubai 1961, United Arab Emirates (e-mail: ahmed@insyab.com). [5] . During this global emergency, applications of the digital technologies are numerous, including tactile robotics to help the medical doctors and nurses at hospitals, drones to monitor the crowds, artificial intelligence and deep learning for understanding the health-care trends, Internet of Things (IoT) for supply chain automation, and virtual learning to continue the education. All of these crucial applications and many more in this global pandemic rely on reliable and highspeed communication networks, putting tremendous pressure on these networks. In this context, the international telecommunication union (ITU) conducted an emergency meeting of the broadband commission for sustainable development that directed the governments, industries, and civil society to improve the capacity of communication networks at critical points, such as hospitals and transportation hubs [6] . Not only that, but they also emphasized on the importance of communication technologies in disseminating timely critical information, supporting e-learning for more than 1.5 billion students, training workers by digital means to improve productivity, and promoting e-businesses.",

For instance, a network of drones can be of great benefit in monitoring crowds and maintain social distancing in metropolitan areas (see Fig. 2 ) [12] . Various countries introduced \"pandemic drones\" to enforce social distancing. Not only that, but these pandemic drones can also monitor temperature, flu, sneezing, and coughing in public places [13] - [15] . Once the drones collect the critical information, it needs to be communicated to the authorities in real-time for taking timely actions. Pandemic drones with 5G connectivity can significantly help in such a situation due to its high transmission speed and low latency. Satellite communications is another major technology that is also of great benefit in monitoring, modeling, and responding to the COVID-19 spread. The outbreaks of COVID-19 usually occur in a cluster in specific regions and then continue to spread. As such, the spread can be modeled using high-quality geospatial data. Also, the satellite imagery can identify the population that is at most risk and can track the health and testing facilities [16] .",

            "text": "Another major issue in fighting this pandemic is contact tracing of the infected patients. In this context, Google and Facebook initiated a joint venture by sharing GPS-based mobility data of the users to the researchers [17] . Also, Google and Apple are collaborating to build a contact tracing system that uses Bluetooth signals to sense the nearby smartphones and alert the users if they had encountered a possible COVID-19 patient. Such geospatial data can be quite helpful for public health researchers to understand the spreading of the virus [18] . For instance, the researchers from National Tsing Hua University used Facebook's data to show that limiting human mobility certainly reduces the transmission of the virus [19] . With a slightly different approach, Kinsa Health distributed more than a million smart thermometers in the US to collect the temperature and geospatial information of the households remotely and predict the spread of the virus [20] . The data from these intelligent thermometers can identify the clusters of patients with fever where a sudden spike can detect the presence of COVID-19. This way, an area of possible infected patients can be narrowed down, limiting the spread of the virus. Analogously, researchers at John Hopkins University launched a mobile application where the user can add his/her body temperature and other symptoms that can be used by the government officials and health experts to take timely actions and predict future outbreaks [21] . Indoor Monitoring: In the case of outdoor working environments, outdoor positioning technologies can maintain social distancing and safe working distance for the critical workforce. However, in indoor environments, it may be more challenging due to the unavailability of GPS signals. Hence, novel solutions are needed to guarantee the monitoring of quarantined people and maintain safe working distance in indoor environments. Various indoor positioning technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi, visible light, Zigbee, and Bluetooth can be promising solutions for monitoring the quarantined people and maintaining a safe working distance in indoor environments [22] . One new solution recently developed for this cause is Proximity Trace, which is a sensing-and-communication technology for workforce distance monitoring while continuing essential businesses [23] . In Proximity Trace, a tag is attached to the worker hat or worn on a lanyard that transmits real-time alerts when the workers are in close contact (see Fig. 3 ). There is a central gateway that collects all the workers' interaction information. This technology provides both passive and active solutions. In the passive approach, the interaction of a worker is tracked, in case, tested positive for the virus. In an active method, the workers are informed using sound or visuals to maintain the social distance.",

These robots can cover the shortage of personal protective equipment required for doctors and nurses. For example, Ava Robotics' introduced iRobot for hospitals that help the doctors that are in quarantine at home to stay in the emergency rooms (virtually) without the risk of getting the virus [27] . Not only this but also the hospitals can continuously collect the patient information using these connected robots and share it with the remote center that can significantly improve the efficiency of healthcare systems. The exchange of information from these robots and their navigation requires reliable and low latency communication that can be provided by 5G technologies. China has witnessed the use of 5G-enabled healthcare automation by implementing a 5G+ remote consultation system across its various hospitals [28] . In this system, the medical staff at a hospital can take consultation from the expert's miles away through remote video connections. Fig. 4 illustrates an example of such a connected healthcare system.",

According to the report of Akamai [56] , the entire global internet traffic has increased by 30% in March 2020, which is ten times more than average. This record-breaking use of the internet creates vulnerability with the spike in malicious attacks, such as phishing emails, inserting malware to COVID-19 related resources, and even selling fake cures for COVID-19 [57] . Also, many enterprise Re-invent or abandon Abandon employees work remotely from home, and it is challenging to provide authentication solutions for all users. As the businesses will become mainly online and follow e-commerce, more cyberattacks are expected [58] . Also, with the automation of industries where the devices are more connected than ever can initiate various vulnerabilities for cybercriminals. Perhaps, the new digital technologies that are evolving at a rapid rate during the pandemic can be classified as a high cybersecurity risk. Is 5G Really Harmful? Combating the Misinformation: The COVID-19 pandemic has breathed new life into anti-5G conspiracy theories. Recently a British conspiracy theorist David Icke claimed in an interview, linking the COVID-19 outbreak and 5G technology. He argued that Wuhan was the first Chinese city to roll-out 5G, just before the virus outbreak. However, it is not true; Wuhan was among several Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, to get 5G. Also, the WHO found no evidence that 5G adversely affects health [11] . The fear of 5G has prompted acts of violence in various countries where the cell towers have been attacked and set on fire [8] . These conspiracy theories have to be strongly invalidated (or adjust regulations) and need to be publicized in the media so that communication technology services keep progressing. In this regard, the wireless communication technologies itself is combating with the misinformation. Researchers around the globe working with wireless communication technologies provided clarifications to fight this misinformation. For example, Peter Popovski, who is a professor of wireless communications at Aalborg University presented several points to clarify this misconception, such as fear of new technology, most of the wireless devices do not have 5G at the moment, and no evidence of 5G adversely affects on health [10] . To the best of our knowledge, also concluded by WHO, radiations of 5G and other communication technologies are not harmful to human health. Indeed, wireless communication technologies are vital in keeping the societies functioning when there is a massive lockdown due to COVID-19.",

            "text": "Around the world, economies are crumbling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where the price of every commodity has fallen significantly [59]. The hard calculation for governments is trading life of the people who will die of the COVID-19 versus economic damage [60] . Over the past three months, the world's biggest stock markets have turned red because the investors have to re-calculate the future for the economy. In the financial crisis (2007-08), there was a steady downfall of the economy. However, in the pandemic situation, investors are not pricing in due to strict lock-downs, leading to the crash of the global economy with low gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year (see Fig. 7 ). This all started when the Chinese government shut down the manufacturing industry to prevent the spread of the virus. Since China makes one-third of the World products, the shut down caused a delay in the production leading to the disruption in supply chain throughout the world [61] . For example, the car industry depends on various tools and machinery to manufacture their cars, where each one of these necessities experiences 1-3 months delay due to the shut down of the manufacturing sector in China. This means that car companies will not be able to launch new vehicles on time, missing out billions of dollars of sale. The same is true for other industries where the drop in sale can lead to the company's layoff and bankruptcies. One such example is the collapse of OneWeb, a leading project on small satellites with 74 satellites already in orbits to provide internet from space [62] . The industry needs to develop a strategic response by moving towards a low-touch or touch-less economy to fight this global issue and prepare for continuous disruptions. A matrix such as the COVID-19 strategy matrix can be followed to respond in such a crisis [53] . For example, industries, such as e-commerce, can still generate good revenue in the short run and need only to keep up with the supply; however, sectors like tourism are very uncertain and need to look at a new start or abandoning in the long run. The COVID-19 strategy matrix is given in Table 1 , which relates the impact and response for different industries. Moreover, it is the right time for the stakeholders to invest more in research and development (R&D) because most of the innovative companies in the global financial crisis (2007-08) spent more on R&D, which has paid off in profit and growth [53] . Specifically, R&D in digital technologies can pave the way for low-touch economy by developing novel smart solutions [63] . Not only that, but these technologies can also monitor the state of the economy. For example, the researchers at WeBank have shown from the analysis of geospatial data that China's economy is recovering. They used visible and infrared images from the satellites to look for the activities in hot spots. Analogously, Ursa space systems is using images from their synthetic aperture radar satellites and use data analytics to see the impact of COVID-19 on global oil inventories [64] . With strict lockdowns, many companies are taking an interest in satellite imagery to collect information concerning operational activities in the concerned area.",

However, recent advances in IoT can contribute to streamline the supply chain and reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Also, IoT technology can play a significant role in the automation of industries that can further improve the supply chain. For instance, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can enable smart and adaptable manufacturing utilizing smart sensors and reliable connectivity for interconnecting and digitalizing of the traditional factories [65] . This can allow self-organizing, remote monitoring, and collaborative control for the conventional industries (see Fig.  8 ). The primary reason for establishing IIoT is that intelligent machines can efficiently collect, communicate, and act in a real-time industrial environment. To achieve this, IIoT requires stable and uninterrupted massive-and-ubiquitous high-speed connectivity, low-latency below one millisecond, and ultrareliability to support real-time monitoring and provide automation. Consequently, all these metrics are the characteristics of 5G technology, and therefore the concept of IIoT can be realized by using 5G [66] . Moreover, 5G connectivity can potentially transform the supply chain by helping the companies to precisely measure consumer demands and react in real-time with changing situations.",

Moreover, the combination of 5G and other technologies such as IoT, AI, blockchain, and AR/VR will transform the e-commerce industry [69] . For instance, with 5G connectivity, IoT will enable the fast transfer of data to improve the consumer experience, track real-time inventory, and effectively manage orders. Likewise, AR/VR with 5G connectivity can allow the customers to place a real product virtually.

According to this risk score, dental hygienists, bus drivers, and economists are at high, medium, and low risks, respectively. Digital technologies can play a significant role here in providing low-touch or touchless solutions for the occupations that are at medium/high risks. For example, the labor working in a supermarket can be equipped with smart wearable sensors to maintain minimum distances, avoiding the possible contamination of the virus.

However, every economic recession also plays a part in costing lives. For instance, unemployment is already rising; in the past few weeks in the US only, millions of people lost their jobs. Unemployment can further increase the death rate in a society giving rise to heart diseases. Besides unemployment, our modern societies require a sustainable health system, healthy nutrition, and clean water that may not be available during a deep recession. Hence, the long-term shutdowns can indeed flatten the curve but also would cause lives. Also, in low-income countries where the labor community survive on daily income, lockdowns can cause starving. According to the recent statement of the UN World Food Program (WFP), more prolonged shutdowns can lead to a hunger pandemic [71] . Therefore, epidemiological modeling of the COVID-19 spread and its socioeconomic impact is essential, where it follows an exponential growth in most countries around the world.

This dependency creates vulnerability with the spike in malicious attacks, such as phishing emails, inserting malware to COVID-19 related resources, and even selling fake cures for COVID-19 [57] . Moreover, as the businesses will become mainly online and follow e-commerce, more cyberattacks are expected [58] . Also, with the automation of industries where the devices are more connected than ever can initiate various vulnerabilities for cybercriminals. Amidst \"flatten the curve\" for the spread of the virus, increase in the cybersecurity threats should also be mitigated. With this in mind, the awareness and tools developed during the pandemic for cybersecurity can help online businesses become more robust in the new normal.",
