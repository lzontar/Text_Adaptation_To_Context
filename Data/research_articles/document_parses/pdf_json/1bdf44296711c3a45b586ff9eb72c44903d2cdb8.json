This problem often limits the extent to which work organizations utilize their talents. Here, we briefly review relevant work from outside the management field and nascent work within the field to build a conceptual model for understanding the integration of veterans into the workplace. We do this by applying diversity and person-environment fit perspectives. A diversity standpoint helps us to understand veterans as a social group and their inclusion in the workplace, while the person-environment fit perspective helps us describe veterans' compatibility with their work environments in terms of organizational demands and veterans' needs. We intend for this conceptual model to guide future empirical research on veterans as human capital and their transition into civilian organizations as part of their societal reintegration, career development, and personal well-being.",

Veterans possess desirable values and valuable knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) (Hiatt, Carlos, & Sine, 2018; Simpson & Sariol, 2018) . They are a sizable social group, given that there are 20.4 million veterans in the U.S. (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020a) , and more are joining the workforce (Stern, 2017 ). Yet, many organizations overlook veterans as a human capital resource or fail to fully utilize the KSAs they have developed through their military service.",

Also, some organizations are reluctant to hire veterans (Stone & Stone, 2015) , and veterans often face bias during job screenings (Stone, Lengnick-Hall, & Muldoon, 2018) . Veterans who do gain employment tend to face discrimination, negative stereotypes, stigma, underemployment, identity strain, exclusion, and a lack of adjustment (McAllister, Mackey, Hackney, & Perrew\u00e9, 2015; Shepherd, Kay, & Gray, 2019) . For these and other reasons, many veterans struggle with integrating into a workplace as part of their transition into civilian life (Black & Papile, 2010; Gati, Ryzhik, & Vertsberger, 2013) , which could include failing to find or maintain employment (Ford, 2017) . These problems are evidenced in current employment and unemployment rates for veterans and civilians. While the unemployment 2.1. Veterans' civilian societal integration Sociological research on veterans has centered on the \"life course\" perspective (See MacLean & Elder Jr, 2007 for a review) . This research considers military service as a life-altering experience that influences veterans' entire lives, including their physical and mental health (Zatzick et al., 1997) , educational attainment (Kleykamp, 2013) , interactions with civilians (Demers, 2011) , homelessness rate (Rosenheck & Koegel, 1993) and family relationships (Ruger, Wilson, & Waddoups, 2002) . These studies consistently show there is a multitude of negative effects from military service while veterans reintegrate into civilian society. Research examining military experience, however, shows either negative or no effects from military experience on economic outcomes (Cooney Jr, Segal, Segal, & Falk, 2003; Mehay & Hirsch, 1996) , but a lower likelihood of being called back after a job interview (Baert & Balcaen, 2013) . Studies comparing \"wartime\" or service periods (e.g., World War II, Vietnam, post-9/11) depict differences in the amount of civilian support for the wars and the impact of such support on the ability of veterans to reintegrate into society (Beamish, Molotch, & Flacks, 1995) . Additionally, differences across gender, race, and ethnicity affect veterans' levels of employment and wages (Kleykamp, 2013) .",

            "text": "Spanning the last several decades, labor economics and sociology perspectives have examined how the military experience affects future civilian work (Bryant, Samaranayake, & Wilhite, 1993; MacLean, 2017) and whether or not having had military service leads to greater levels of productivity, human capital, and higher wages (De Tray, 1982) . These perspectives present mixed findings (Little & Fredland, 1979; Teachman, 2004) . One important finding, however, is that certain military occupations transfer more easily into civilian jobs (Bryant et al., 1993; Mangum & Ball, 1987) . This has led to more recent studies that question whether or not a match between civilian jobs and military training leads to higher rates of employment and socioeconomic attainment. Such \"job matching\" may mean that veterans who obtain transferable experiences in the military may transition better and have higher employment prospects than veterans in military fields that provide an unclear path to civilian jobs (Routon, 2014) . Studies from labor economics have utilized a variety of data sources and methods, including archival panel data and data from various governmental sources (e.g., Angrist & Krueger, 1994; Little & Fredland, 1979) , cross-sectional surveys (e.g., Routon, 2014) , and experimental designs (e.g., Kleykamp, 2013) . Nonetheless, this economic perspective on the transferability of military experience and employment uses a \"macro\" lens that, while highlighting the importance of job transferability, is unable to answer questions about how organizations can best capitalize on the skills and abilities that people develop in the military.",

The military experience also serves as a source of acculturation and improves veterans' human and social capital, serving as a credential that is \"especially advantageous for disadvantaged groups\" (Kleykamp, 2013, p. 839 ). These differences, along with other attributes such as veteran's education, imply that veterans are as diverse as their experiences and should not be treated as a monolithic group (Kleykamp, 2013) .",

PTSD is associated with the intense reliving of traumatic or life-threatening events through disruptive memories, ruminating on past events, having nightmares, avoiding scenarios that serve as reminders of the previous event, and being hypervigilant (Hayes, VanElzakker, & Shin, 2012) . Research on veterans' PTSD is extensive, perhaps due to its relevance to medical and psychological care, but PTSD is only one of various mental disorders that can result from the experience of war. Despite being associated with veterans, PTSD is more common among civilians since a variety of traumatic events such as natural disasters, violent personal assaults, accidents, as well as war, can lead to the disorder. Further, the psychological impact of war is stronger for civilians than for veterans, even if this impact is overlooked by the media (De Rond & Lok, 2016) .",

Government estimates suggest that 20% to 30% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans show PTSD symptoms (U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, 2015) .

Nonetheless, veterans who have been diagnosed with PTSD or show symptoms of the disorder face poorer levels of health, a lower quality of life, higher incidences of self-medicating, higher rates of substance abuse, and a high suicide rate, along with work-related outcomes such as unemployment, poor workplace functioning, and absenteeism (Greden et al., 2010; Hoge, Terhakopian, Castro, Messer, & Engel, 2007; Zatzick et al., 1997) .",

The unique, traumatic experience of combat can lead to a great amount of distress during and after service. Such experiences may be associated with depression, anxiety, anger problems, and functional impairment (Pflanz & Sonnek, 2002; Wright, Cabrera, Eckford, Adler, & Bliese, 2012) . Combat veterans are also more likely to divorce (Ruger et al., 2002) and to experience PTSD than other veterans (MacLean & Edwards, 2010; McAllister et al., 2015) . Combat experience is not common to all veterans, although approximately 58% of post-9/11 service members have been deployed at least once to a combat zone (Parker, Igielnik, & Arditi, 2019) , and more than 2.7 million service members were deployed to combat zones between 2001 and 2015, accounting for more than five million combat deployments (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018) . Further, the indirect exposure to combat experienced in many military jobs, such as damage control surgery medics in war zones (De Rond & Lok, 2016) , can also lead to trauma and psychological injury. In sum, actual combat and indirect exposure to combat are important to consider because they can adversely impact the personal and work lives of veterans.",

Nonetheless, a synthesis of these research areas shows there are gaps in our knowledge about the experience of veterans in work organizations and about how civilian organizations can best capitalize on veterans' experiences and KSAs, as well as meet individual needs beyond providing them with employment and income. These research questions may be best addressed from industrial/organizational psychology and management perspectives.",

Applying Stone and Colella's (1996) perspective on hiring workers with disabilities, Stone and Stone (2015) reviewed the organizational factors that affect human resource decisions related to hiring veterans, including stigma, veteran attributes, fit, and the perceived level of their skill transferability. In their study of stereotypes of veterans and their chances for employment, Stone et al. (2018) found that people examining resumes of veterans believed that, relative to civilians, veterans had a stronger perceived job fit, better leadership skills, better teamwork skills, and greater emotional stability, but that they had fewer social skills. Similarly, Shepherd et al. (2019) discovered that laypeople, managers, and employees perceive veteran workers to be planners but to lack the ability to feel emotions and sensations. Further, a study by McAllister et al. (2015) , which was published in a military psychology journal, showed that the lack of congruence between a veteran's military and civilian workplace identity was related to higher job stress and identity strain, as well as lower vigor and work intensity. These perceptions drive beliefs that veterans are incompatible in jobs or careers that require emotional intelligence and so-called \"soft\" or \"people\" skills.",

Koch-Bayram and Wernicke (2018) found that CEOs with military experience, relative to civilian CEOs, were less likely to be involved in financial misconduct due to being more obedient and more likely to follow rules and regulations. Finally, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018 found that having organizational ties to the military was associated with a higher level of venture survival in countries with armed conflict.

We posit that diversity and P-E fit perspectives are pertinent to understand the experience of veterans in civilian work organizations. First, by adopting a diversity standpoint (Shore et al., 2011; van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007) , we describe veterans as a source of workplace diversity and a demographic group in need of greater inclusion. We explain key workplace experiences, attitudes, and behaviors of veterans in light of their being a minority social group, including discrimination against them, stereotyping, stigma, and identity strain. Second, we adopt a P-E fit perspective (Edwards, 2008; Kristof-Brown, Zimmerman, & Johnson, 2005) to describe the compatibility between veterans' military experiences, values, beliefs, norms, and KSAs and their civilian organizations. We address organizations' utilization of veteran employees from a demands-abilities perspective, which refers to the extent to which employees' abilities meet organizational demands, and their compatibility from a needs-supplies perspective, which refers to the extent to which an organization's environment satisfies employee needs (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005) . Finally, we use a societal reintegration lens and reconsider veterans' well-being to address how positive work experiences spill over into the non-work lives of veterans. We advance several propositions and describe our conceptual framework intended to outline the future research agenda on veterans in the workforce. We depict this conceptual framework as a research model in figure Fig. 1 .",

Traditionally, these demographic attributes have been associated with access to status, power, and resources in work organizations (van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007) . Although veteran status has been overlooked in diversity research within the management field, it is nevertheless a social category by which people define themselves and others. Veteran status shares many aspects with other social identities, including being unchangeable, which is similar to biological sex and race, and being relatively invisible, which is the case with sexual orientation. Moreover, veteran status is task-related since it is associated with specific KSAs. It is also associated with specific deep-level values, beliefs, and personality traits that comprise cognitive diversity. Similar to certain other demographic attributes, affirmative action legislation, including the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), exists to protect veterans from employment discrimination in the U.S. Further, disabled veterans are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).",

Moreover, there is a \"business case\" for diversity that focuses on increasing firm performance through diversity (van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007) . Diversity principles related to social group fairness in hiring, pay, and other workplace procedures apply to veterans (Angrist, 1998; MacLean, 2017) . Like other demographic minorities, many veterans have experienced workplace discrimination, exclusion, and a lack of organizational support that, along with the perceptions that they have a poor level of compatibility, are reasons for a high amount of work stress and tension (Wenger, 2014) . For these reasons, the social justice rationale behind the organizational inclusion of demographic minorities is applicable to military veterans as a social group. This application would have the goals for organizations to provide veterans with equal access to resources and information as other social groups and to treat them as insiders who fully participate, contribute, and influence decisions in the organization (Roberson, 2006; Shore et al., 2011) . Assessing experiences that are unique or more common among veterans, such as the stigma of trauma, can help us to apply a diversity perspective to veterans and help us to understand how organizations can increase the numerical representation of veterans and foster their inclusion in organizations.",

Diversity research that concerns social identities and relies on social identity theory (Hogg & Terry, 2000) holds that people belong to a multitude of social groups and possess multiple identities that are negotiated over time and space. Some identities may be more central to one's self-concept or be more salient in a particular situation (Tajfel & Turner, 1985) . Military experience is one of many social group identities that may be salient to veterans, along with social identities associated with the demographics typically examined in diversity research. Being a military veteran can be a central component of veterans' identity or can become salient in a work environment if it provides them with a sense of distinctiveness from other people.

Military service shapes the identities of service members, beginning with their self-selection into the military. This identity is strengthened in basic training or \"boot camp,\" which breaks down and strips recruits of their civilian identities and replaces those identities with a military one that is further developed over their time in the military. This acculturation and socialization process emphasizes strong kinship bonds, camaraderie, and unit norms, and to even consider equipment as a symbolic part of themselves (Godfrey, 2016; Woodward & Jenkings, 2011) , causing military service to become a core component of their self (Daley, 2013) . This socialization process is a complex and lifechanging experience that carries over into veterans' post-military-service lives (Arkin & Dobrofsky, 1978) . As veterans leave the military, they often struggle to adapt to a civilian world and lifestyle and to find work in an environment with which their sense of self clashes (Black & Papile, 2010) , which places a strain on their self-identity. Many veterans attempt to maintain their self-identity but express a sense of loss upon returning to civilian life (Brunger, Serrato, & Ogden, 2013) . A poor transition into the workplace may translate into a loss of community, financial security, and a sense that one's life is purposeful (Brunger et al., 2013) . This loss can be exacerbated by a forced discharge from the military due to health issues or combat trauma. For example, infantrymen who are required to be physically fit may see their sense of self-worth decrease (Haynie & Shepherd, 2011) and experience identity strain if they become injured and unable to fulfill their military duties.",

While many veterans are proud of their military experience and identify highly with other veterans, being a veteran has a stigma-a perceived personal flaw within a social context (Goffman, 1963; Ragins, 2008) . A common stigma is that veterans are \"crazy\" and \"ticking time bombs,\" views often perpetuated by media portrayals of veterans as traumatized or \"damaged\" (Kleykamp & Hipes, 2015) . The stigma is stronger for veterans who engaged in combat or show signs of PTSD (Hipes, Lucas, & Kleykamp, 2014) . Paradoxically, civilians have reported they assume combat veterans have behavioral problems, but also report being more socially closer to and more supportive of combat veterans than of non-combat veterans (MacLean & Kleykamp, 2014) . Unfortunately, people who belong to stigmatized groups face stereotyping, harassment, prejudice, and discrimination in society and at work (Crocker & Major, 1989; Ragins, 2008) .",

Most veterans disclose their military identity to prospective employers during the job application process, but many conceal their identity to colleagues or supervisors to avoid being ostracized, criticized, or harassed. The reasons cited by veterans who do so include avoiding false assumptions made by coworkers about their mental health and political ideology. By one estimate, up to 40% of veterans hide their military background from their colleagues (McGregor, 2015) , a proportion higher than the rate of nondisclosure of sexual orientation by LGBT community members (Croteau, 1996) . An unintended adverse consequence of the nondisclosure of one's veteran identity is failing to receive needed mental health care to avoid the shame associated with seeking such care (Ouimette et al., 2011; Vogt, 2011) . Even though stigma is associated with adverse consequences, concealing a stigmatized identity that is valued and central to one's self-concept also leads to psychological distress (Quinn & Chaudoir, 2009) .",

As a result, many are concerned with how disclosing their mental health issues would affect their employment, colleagues' feelings about them, and how it might lead to potential rejection (Brohan et al., 2012) . Veterans face similar barriers and struggles in the workforce, and theory on employees with disabilities has informed how we think about veterans' experiences at work (Stone & Stone, 2015) . There are, however, differences between these groups.

Because of social identity and categorization processes (Tajfel & Turner, 1985) , veterans and civilian coworkers may see each other as distinct social groups, which can result in bias, prejudice, lower interpersonal trust, a lower amount of communication, and less cooperation among them. By applying research on tokenism and relational demography (Kanter, 1977; Riordan, 2000) , we predict that a lack of numerical representation of veterans in the workplace would result in greater work stress and turnover. On the other hand, the presence of other employees and managers in the organization who have military experience should signal to veterans that they are welcomed in the organization (Shore et al., 2011) . A high proportion of veterans in the workplace can also stimulate a sense of belongingness to the workgroup and organization and lead to greater workgroup cohesion, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and work engagement. This numerical or proportional presence of veterans in the organization could also drive intergroup contact, which builds knowledge about one another through increased communication and reduce bias, prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006) , and stigma. The information and decision-making perspective (van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007) would emphasize that veterans provide divergent viewpoints and a broader cognitive range of KSAs, expertise, and perspectives that drive elaboration processes and better decision-making.",

Recent research suggests that organizations should implement diversity management practices to build a climate for inclusion that focuses on the experiences of unique social groups (Dwertmann et al., 2016) , such as LGBT employees, religious minorities, and military veterans. Aside from building a general climate for inclusion that is hospitable to all, organizations can also implement focused efforts in diversity management. A hospitable climate for veteran inclusion would imply integrating them socially; valuing their values, norms, and beliefs; and recognizing their KSAs.",

Applying P-E fit can reveal how adequate management can bring to light relevant individual attributes, experiences, and abilities. We need to understand how the distinct attributes and KSAs that people develop in their military service apply to the different types of fit (e.g., supplementary versus complementary) in the workplace. Here, we assess common attributes that are developed through military service, including values, norms, beliefs, and abilities such as leadership, teamwork, and coping with stress.

These MOS categories are perhaps the most observable way of viewing KSAs veterans attain during their service. Some MOS categories have clearly defined civilian counterparts and have a greater degree of skill transferability than other MOSs (Mangum & Ball, 1987) , and there are websites with \"translators\" that show the civilian equivalents for various military occupations based on their similarities (e.g., military.com; onetonline.org). For example, the Army MOS 1 of military police aligns with civilian police officer, and the MOS of medic is somewhat transferable to health care occupations such as emergency medical technician. By contrast, an MOS that is highly specialized in combat or military operations (e.g., Field Artillery Automated Tactical Data System Specialist) may not be easily transferable to a civilian role or workplace. The presence of occupational similarity does not mean that a transition will be direct, given that veterans may face barriers such as needing licenses and additional certification programs (Keita, Diaz, Miller, Olenick, & Simon, 2015; Voelpel, Escallier, Fullerton, & Rodriguez, 2018) .

Military officer training has been shown to improve leadership abilities and to increase the likelihood of becoming a manager in the future (Gr\u00f6nqvist & Lindqvist, 2016) . Some military leadership abilities, attributes, and styles are equivalent to the corporate leadership styles studied in management.",

Moreover, the military's value of self-sacrifice is analogous to servant leadership's focus on serving others before oneself. Servant leadership attributes such as stewardship, trustworthiness, community building, and a need to serve (Van Dierendonck, 2011) are consistent with military values. Military leaders are responsible for tending to all needs of the men and women under their command (Wong et al., 2003) . Such leaders must take responsibility for orders across ranks and must attend to all needs of the soldiers who are deployed under their command, including their financial and family issues. The notion that military leaders would not \"send someone where he or she would not go himself or herself\" aligns with responsible leadership. This notion or style of leadership centers on building trustful relationships among stakeholders based on an inner obligation to do the right thing unto others (Maak & Pless, 2006) . Differences in leadership between military and civilian organizations do exist. For example, a meta-analysis shows that transformational leadership had a greater impact on perceptions of effectiveness in military than in non-military groups (Gaspar, 1992) . Assuming that veteran employees pursuing leadership roles are able, with help from their organizations, to translate their leadership abilities to a civilian environment, veteran status will be associated with the attributes and styles characteristic of servant, ethical, and responsible leadership.",

Research shows that the support veterans receive from their leaders and supervisors is important in reducing their stress (Hammer, Brady, & Perry, 2019) , which demonstrates the importance of the behavior of veterans' managers and leaders. As stated earlier, the numerical representation of veterans in managerial roles should have a positive effect on their work outcomes. Such an effect is likely to occur not only due to relational demography effects, but also because veteran managers and leaders are likely to understand and exhibit leadership styles and behaviors consistent with the military values, norms, and beliefs veteran employees in followership roles likely uphold. Regardless of their managerial or leadership experiences in the military, we suggest that veteran employees in followership roles are more likely to fit in organizations whose leaders and managers exhibit leadership styles and behaviors consistent with servant, ethical, and responsible leadership.",

Similarly, meaningful work is likely more important for people who have been socialized into a culture that values duty, service, and self-sacrifice. One study of male veterans found that having meaningful work is associated with an increase in self-esteem (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). Doenges (2011) found that student veterans who found meaningful work in their self-defined calling reported an increase in their meaning in life, positive affect, and positive relationships. Further, finding meaningful work has been ranked by veterans as extremely important, ranking it above finding competitive employment (Schutt et al., 2003) .",

Considering the intersectionality of veteran status, race, and combat experience for stigmatization suggests that stigma consciousness and related outcomes, including identity strain and work stress, are higher for African American combat veterans than for their white counterparts. Although these studies concern the experiences of African Americans, their arguments, which are based on institutional racism and having lower access to power and resources in society, suggest that increases in strain and stress also apply to other race/ethnic demographic minority groups.

The experience of war and combat can be deeply disturbing, but this experience and its aftermath are complex and can also have positive outcomes. The cultural, professional, and organizational context through which service members filter, frame, and cope with their war experiences can shape psychological injuries, making war experiences traumatic for some but not for all (de Rond & Lok, 2016) . Moreover, the grit, hardiness, and ability to work under pressure developed through combat challenges can be a catalyst that teaches veteran employees to overcome obstacles in their lives and careers. Research shows that veterans who engaged in combat are more likely to develop coping skills, value human life, and have a clearer sense of direction in their lives.

This type of growth can become a social learning experience similar to the normalization of the stigma for veterans who have PTSD, depression, suicidal ideation, or other mental disorders but tend to underutilize mental health services (Michalopoulou, Welsh, Perkins, & Ormsby, 2017) . When someone realizes he or she is not the only one who needs help, he or she can find culturally accepted ways to embrace and overcome the stigma and maintain a high level of self-esteem (Bryan & Morrow, 2011) . Similarly, in organizational settings, veterans who have experienced and overcome combat trauma through PTG are more likely to embrace their veteran identity and avoid identity strain thanks to the fortitude, perseverance, bravery, and personal strength associated with this personal growth (Peterson, Park, Pole, D'Andrea, & Seligman, 2008) . This implies that PTG is a mediating mechanism through which combat experience shapes the relationship between veteran employees' perceived stigmatization from the disclosure of their veteran status to others at work and their experience of identity strain. Since not all combat veterans experience trauma, this would constitute a partial mediation of a moderating relationship. For instance, for veterans who have experienced combat trauma, PTG would weaken the relationship between their perceived stigmatization from their veteran status disclosure to others at work and identity strain. Thus: Proposition 12. PTG will partially mediate the moderation combat experience has on the relationship of veteran employees' perceived stigmatization with their (a) disclosure of their veteran status in the workplace and their (b) identity strain. The role of perceived veteran stigmatization on (lower) identity disclosure and (greater) identity strain will be strongest for combat veterans who have not experienced PTG, moderate for veterans who did not experience combat, and weakest for combat veterans who experience PTG.",

As described earlier, veterans develop an ability to cope with work stress through their military training and experience, and this ability to cope can be heightened by facing the challenges of war and combat. The experience of PTG is a reason direct and indirect involvement in war and combat helps veterans see their personal and work lives in a better light. PTG is associated with an increase in one's appreciation of life in general, the development of closer and more intimate relationships, and an increase in one's sense of personal strength (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004) . PTG also improves people's appreciation for their work lives, an important aspect of a sense of well-being. Therefore, through PTG, the experience of combat can also inspire veteran employees to focus on what matters most to them, which likely includes the camaraderie and social relationships that can be found in work organizations, and to focus on their purpose in life and the opportunities for service that meaningful work provides.",

The prevalence of these values implies that veterans' compatibility and their experience of inclusion in an organization is particularly important to them.

Nonetheless, the arguments we presented imply that those who are included and fit in their work organizations are likely to exhibit positive work attitudes and behaviors, such as organizational commitment and job engagement, which in effect can serve to ameliorate adverse stigmas and improve their social integration, which can allow veterans and civilians to communicate and learn more from one another.",

However, theories from management can provide a new perspective on veterans' work adjustment and engagement, personal well-being, and societal reintegration. The conceptual framework we presented centers around the core components of post-service integration into civilian life as informed by diversity and P-E fit perspectives, including veterans' numerical representation, identity strain and stigma, discrimination, inclusion, and the organizational utilization of KSAs developed in service. Although some of these phenomena are common to other minority groups, some are more common or unique to veterans as a social group.

Scholars face the theoretical challenges of uncovering which jobs and organizational circumstances allow veterans to perform their best so as to maximize their contribution to organizational goals. Accordingly, we applied diversity and P-E fit theories to veterans by delving into their unique KSAs, values, identity, and challenges in order to understand the individual and organizational determinants of their ability to integrate successfully into the civilian workplace. Acknowledging the contribution of fit and diversity is the first step in learning how to apply veterans' human capital to organizational goals. This application can also uncover how workplace inclusion, compatible workplace environments, and meaningful work can enhance veterans' work adjustment, their successful transition into civilian careers, and their retention in civilian workplaces, as well as ameliorate psychological disorder symptoms and consequences among those who suffer from them and improve their quality of life.",

Many surveys and studies have argued that veterans possess certain KSAs, such as leadership, but have not presented empirical evidence or measured the perceptions non-veteran managers or employees have to assert that veterans possess valued skills. While past research has established that leadership development improves over time through military training (Harms et al., 2011) , we do not know of any laboratory experiments comparing skills or performance across veterans and civilians.

Investiture socialization, which affirms the identity and characteristics of a newcomer, can result in a lower level of stigmatization, greater inclusion, and more effective utilization of KSAs in a new job. Collective tactics, through which entrants undergo common experiences as a group, and serial tactics, through which insiders become role models or mentors, can stimulate intergroup contact. These tactics can drive person-group fit and inclusion as veteran and civilian employees learn about one another and even adopt each other's values, norms, and beliefs thanks to social interaction. Veteran employees have some similarities with newcomers that have work experience, who are less malleable by socialization than neophyte workers because they have been subject to such practices before (Saks et al., 2007) . Nonetheless, socialization and acculturation processes in the military differ greatly from corporate socialization practices, and the lower need to socialize seasoned newcomers may not translate to those who have military but no civilian work experience. Research is needed to understand the impact of socialization processes on veterans' lives and civilian careers.",

Scholars interested in occupational health psychology and management should strive to understand what drives the severity of symptoms and related consequences among those who suffer from PTSD or other mental disorders and continue to learn how to prevent, cope, and recover from them. Our focus on PTG, however, highlights the positive consequences that traumatic experiences can have on veterans' personal and organizational lives. Other unique individual experiences and demographics, such as the length of tenure as a service member, amount of civilian work experience, wartime or service period, military branch membership, level of education, and others, can also shape the role of diversity and fit on organizational behavior and firm outcomes and should be addressed in future research. Studies involving intersectionality should incorporate the experience of female veterans (Demers, 2013) . Other underrepresented social groups such as LGBT community members, Muslims and other religious minorities, and people of Middle-Eastern background may also present nuanced contexts for future research. Exploring these social groups may provide important experiences and interesting cases for the study of intersectionality, the presence of demographic faultlines, and further examples of the importance of stigma, work meaningfulness, and personal values.",

Our conceptual framework and propositions may not be limited to the U.S. and can inform future international empirical work. The experience of veterans is subject to national differences, such as the presence of mandatory military service and history of military conflict. For instance, countries where military service is mandatory may present less of a stigma attached to military service and a greater understanding of the experiences veterans go through. Results from international and foreign-domestic studies may be applicable to better understand the experiences of veterans in the U.S. and other countries. Global and comparative studies on veterans' fit and inclusion may also provide fruitful results.",

Our framework provides two starting points for this goal. We applied the P-E fit perspective to uncover values, norms, and beliefs that are common to military and civilian organizational contexts and KSAs that are applicable to specific jobs and workplaces. This should help managers acknowledge their veteran employees' unique experiences, including their military occupation, values, and specific KSAs. Moreover, managers should recognize the value veterans tend to place on being part of something \"larger than oneself\" and having meaningful work. Broadening the diversity lens, managers should assess whether or not veterans are included in their equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) programs and initiatives. Such programs can include targeted recruitment to increase applications and hiring. Onboarding programs involving training in group settings and mentoring by experienced role models or mentors can stimulate veterans' adjustment right after their transition periods. EDI management programs such as veteran affinity groups can help build social capital among newcomer and seasoned veteran employees by developing networks and strong relationships with other veteran employees, as well as with civilian managers and employees who have experience with and understand veterans. EDI training illustrating the military identity, values, norms, and beliefs unique to veterans can help civilian employees understand and relate better to their veteran coworkers. These socialization and EDI management programs may stimulate persongroup fit, social capital, and organizational support.",
