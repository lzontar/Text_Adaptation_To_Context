There was no evidence that these 11 individuals from Wuhan had an incubation period of more than 1 month and transferred the virus to their family members during this period. Currently published research basically reported that confirmed cases in the presymptomatic stage can result in transmission Yu et al., 2020) , it is yet not clear the transmissibility and transmission rate by asymptomatic carriers. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the transmissibility of asymptomatic carriers, strengthening the management of asymptomatic patients and tracing the close contacts of asymptomatic individuals can close the loophole.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 693, "end": 712, "text": "(Peng et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 713, "end": 732, "text": "Roosa et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1373, "text": "(Arons et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1391, "text": "Bai et al., 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1411, "text": "Rothe et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1729, "text": "Yu et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "According to the statistics of clinical cases, children seem to be less infected. The infection is mainly concentrated in the age group of 31-59 years. Children and youth have been less infected, which may be due to other unknown reasons. According to previous reports, men are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women , but our study found no significant difference in the infection rate of men and women. Most importantly, 25 (47.2%) of the 53 COVID-19 patients were co-infected with M. pneumoniae. Common respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza viruses were not common in the 53 COVID-19 patients. Because monocytes increased after M. pneumoniae infection alone (Puljiz et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2019) , indicating the involvement of monocyterelated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae coinfection in COVID-19 patients. This suggests that we should pay more attention to M. pneumoniae co-infection for COVID-19 patients during clinical testing and corresponding treatment. The existence of underlying diseases may promote the generation of SARS-CoV-2 infection to a certain extent. This is also one of the reasons for the higher mortality rate of the elderly COVID-19 patients (Ji et al., 2020) . Only a few patients had been to Wuhan, while most of the other patients acquired local infections. This confirmed the strong infectivity of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, controlling local clusters is key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Fever, cough, and expectoration are the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. However, it is particularly interesting to note that 13.2% patients in our study showed no fever symptom despite being infected. This suggests that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection could be graded by combining CRP levels with the patient's age (Lu H. et al., 2020) . In this study, we showed that 41.5% of patients had abnormally high CRP levels (\u22655 mg/L). On admission, decreased leukocyte and lymphocyte counts indicated that the immune function of patients was compromised, consistent with a previous report by Xu et al.

Therefore, vaccine research is crucial for effective treatment and control of viral transmission; however, animal experiments and clinical trials are time consuming and cannot produce immediate results.
