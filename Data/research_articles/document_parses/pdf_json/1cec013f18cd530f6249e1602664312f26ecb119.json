She was febrile to 39.5 C and the blood pressure was 130/ 60 mmHg. Respiratory sounds were diminished and crackles were audible bilaterally during inspiration. Results of the heart examination were normal except for the tachycardia. The arterial blood pressure remained stable. The head, throat, and extremities were normal. No cutaneous lesions of lymphadenopathy were found. The abdomen was soft and the liver was unpalpable. An already known splenomegaly due to thalassemia was noted. Arterial blood gas analysis on 100 % oxygen inspiration showed pH 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen PO 2 81 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide PCO 2 32 mmHg, bicarbonate HCO 3 21 mmol/l, and oxygen saturation 96.7 %. Her white blood cell count was 14.5\u00b410 3 /mm 3 with 80 % neutrophils and a marked shift to the left not accompanied by eosinophilia. Other blood count data were hemoglobin 9.3 g/dl, hematocrit 28 %, and platelets 58\u00b410 3 /mm 3 . C-reactive protein was 182 mg/l. Blood coagulation, liver and renal function, and blood sugar were normal. A chest radiograph on arrival showed remarkable deterioration since the first X-ray was taken at the first hospital in the early postoperative period. The radiograph revealed bilateral infiltrates and alveolar consolidation confined to three quadrants (Fig. 1) . Cardiac echocardiography did not show any cardiac dysfunction (Ejection fraction = 75 %, shortening fraction = 37.5 %). From the above findings we made a diagnosis of ARDS developing in the sepsis syndrome.",

Invasive and noninvasive endotoxin-producing strains of this gram-negative bacterium are the most commonly recognized bacterial cause of acute terminal ileitis. They also cause nonspecific abdominal pain or \u00aapseudoappendicitis\u00ba and occasionally acute colitis or acute appendicitis. Severe Y. enterocolitica infections are described in patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia. Iron excess and iron chelator use are predisposing factors, as supported by clinical, animal, and in vitro data. To understand the pathogenesis of the infection one must remember that Y. enterocolitica, an extremely iron-siderophore \u00b1 dependent microorganism, lacks siderophores yet has receptors for them. Desferrioxamine supplies the microorganism with iron in a form it can use (chelating agents bound to iron = exogenous siderophores) [1] . The source of Y. enterocolitica in this patient was not identified. It is known that the microorganism is transmitted to humans mainly from contaminated dairy products, meat, or water. It may also be transmitted human to human via blood transfusion from a bacteremic donor. This possibility cannot be excluded in our case, although the typical clinical presentation of a transfusion\u00b1induced infection in an iron\u00b1overloaded patient is severe septicemia within 24 h after infusion [5] .",

The term septic shock did not characterize the condition of the patient according to the definition suggested by Bone and colleagues [6] . The diagnosis of ARDS was based on the following criteria: (1) acute onset of respiratory symptoms, (2) frontal chest radiography with bilateral infiltrates, and (3) exclusion of left heart disease and congestive heart failure. The lung injury score obtained for the patient was 7 (alveolar consolidation confined to three quadrants and PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 100 mmHg), which also confirmed severe lung injury [7] . The possibility of bilateral hematogenic Yersinia pneumonia after systemic spread from the bowel due to surgery has to be mentioned here; however, the acute onset of clinical presentation, the radiographic findings of widespread airspace consolidation, and the fact that repeated cultures of bronchial secretions were negative, make this diagnosis of secondary importance [8] .",

Many studies indicate that sepsis is the most frequent event precipitating the development of ARDS. Pfenninger et al. [10] found that in children aged 2 weeks to 15 years, intraabdominal infection and/or sepsis are the most common causes. On the other hand, among patients with gram-negative bacteremia or sepsis the frequency of ARDS has been reported to vary from 18 to 38 % [9] . It is interesting that, although many cases of septicemia due to Y. enterocolitica have been described, there is no reference to ARDS related to Yersinia sepsis in the current literature.",

            "text": "Referring to the patient's treatment, antimicrobial therapy consisted of a combination of an aminoglycoside and an ureidopenicillin/b-lactamase inhibitor which were found sensitive in the microorganism isolated from blood and intraoperative appendix cultures. The dosage of intravenous amikacin administered was 15 mg/kg per day, which is suggested as effective treatment for Y. enterocolitica septicemia unless adaption to the patient's renal function is necessary [3] . Amikacin blood levels were measured during treatment and were found to be within therapeutic limits. The combination of an aminoglycoside and a third-generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolone is also suggested by many to be effective in Yersinia sepsis. In particular, fluoroquinolones are suggested to be a suitable treatment for Y. enterocolitica septicemia because most of the available parameters (in vitro activity, pharmacological properties, therapeutic effect in animal models, and clinical results) are favorable [3] . Persistence of clinical signs of ARDS and X-ray findings was noted. This is probably due to the increased susceptibility to Yersinia infections of these patients and is also confirmed by reports of acute septicemia, intraabdominal abscess, intestinal perforation, or gangrene and peritonitis following Yersinia infection of the gastrointestinal tract even under antiyersinial therapy [2] . However, we cannot know whether changing the treatment to other sensitive antibiotics (combination of a fluoroquinolone and a third generation cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside) would have shortened the response to therapy in our case [3] . Nevertheless, authors agree that early and accurate diagnosis and specific therapy are required in such patients. When Yersinia enterocolitis or mesenteric adenitis are suspected, an ultrasound examination has to be performed. Initial treatment includes antiyersinial therapy and temporarily stopping chelation [1] . Surgery may lead to hematogenic contamination and enhance sepsis [11] . This probably explains the rapid postoperative development of the sepsis syndrome in our patient. Recognition of Yersinia infection does not always forestall laparotomy; such patients may have conditions with true surgical consequences of infection accompanying adenitis, as was described in our case.",
