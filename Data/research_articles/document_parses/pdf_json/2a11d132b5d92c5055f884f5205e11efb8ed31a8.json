Lung POCUS demonstrates a higher sensitivity 29 than chest x-ray (CXR) in detecting pulmonary pathologies such as pleural effusion, alveolar 30 consolidation, pneumothorax and interstitial syndrome (3-7). Ultrasound also offers benefits over 31 computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) given its low cost, ease of 32 use, ability to offer real-time data, and lack of radiation exposure. Streamlined protocols aimed at 33 differentiating etiologies of dyspnea using POCUS are widely used in the ED, and often are 34 considered standard of care (8). 35 COVID-19, the clinical illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, evolved into a global pandemic 36 over a few short months (9). COVID-19 exhibits a wide range of clinical presentations from 37 asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (10). Given its value in assessing 38 pulmonary pathology, lung POCUS has evolved as an important strategy to evaluate patients 39 with suspected COVID-19 (11-13). Among many challenges encountered during this global 40 crisis, maintaining the health and safety of health care workers (HCWs) has been critical (14-16). 41",

The bilateral areas from here to the inferior scapula border are known as zones 79 right posterior (RP) and left posterior (LP) (Figure 3A). With the transducer positioned sagittal 80 and the probe marker cranially slide the probe back and forth across the hemithorax between the 81 posterior axillary line and the paravertebral line up to the mid-scapular border (i.e. lawnmower 82 technique, Figure 3C). Avoid scanning directly over the scapula as it obscures views of lung 83 tissue. Once complete, use the lawnmower technique to evaluate the area between the posterior 84 and anterior axillary lines starting at the most posterior and inferior point of the thorax (Figure 853E-F). We refer to these lung zones as lateral superior and lateral inferior zones on the right and 86 left respectively (Figure 3B-C). This protocol should be repeated on the contralateral hemithorax 87 as COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates bilateral findings. 88 89 DISCUSSION 90 Here we present a rapid protocol for performing lung POCUS on patients with suspected from the posterior and lateral lung fields. This protocol maximizes both clinical utility and 93 provider safety when assessing patients with suspected COVID-19. We argue this focused 94 protocol which minimizes time spent scanning and optimizes provider positioning decreases 95 exposure risk for HCWs. 96 Classically, in a supine patient, a 12-point lung POCUS including 2 anterior field zones, 97 2 lateral field zones, and 2 posterior field zones bilaterally has been used to evaluate dyspneic 98 patients in the ED (8). This approach has also been recommended by some for use in patients 99 with suspected COVID-19 (13). Recently, a novel 14-zone lung scan which in addition to the 12-100 zones above adds 2 zones located adjacent to the bilateral scapulae posteriorly has been 101 described for patients with suspected COVID-19 (27). Althought most findings are found both 102 posteriorly and laterally, no protocols have advocated for a 6-zone protocol. Our protocol not 103 only recommends placing patients sitting up or prone instead of supine, it enables providers to 104 have less scanning time thereby decreasing the risk of sustained exposure. 105 In addition to acquiring images from the posterior and lateral lung fields, existing 106 scanning protocols proposed for use patients with COVID-19 also describe assessing the anterior 107 lung fields for B-lines or subpleural consolidations (13,27). While we acknowledge that findings 108 consistent with COVID-19 can be observed anteriorly, in particular B-lines, we argue that 109 scanning anteriorly is often not needed to obtain clinically useful data. Though appropriate 110 personal protective equipment should offer some reassurance, adding anterior lung fields to 111 scanning protocols in these cases confers additional risk of exposure to the sonographer from 112 being positioned in front of an often tachypneic patient and from remaining in the exam room 113 longer than absolute necessary. Our protocol focuses on image acquisition from the posterior and 114 lateral lung fields where sonographic findings of COVID-19 are most likely to be identified. If lung POCUS using our protocol is negative but the provider still suspects pathology, then 116 scanning anterior lung fields may be necessary for diagnosis. In cases where scanning anterior 117 lung fields is deemed necessary, to minimize exposure we recommend maintaining the proposed 118 positioning with the provider and machine placed behind the patient, and the provider can 119 carefully reach around the patient to scan anterior lung fields bilaterally. 120 In our protocol, patient positioning is key to reducing exposure to possible respiratory 121 droplets. Upright positioning may be more comfortable for many patients in acute respiratory 122 distress facilitating easier access to the posterior lung fields. Further, placing patients in a prone 123 position has shown mortality benefit in cases of severe non-SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS (28). 124 Similarly, awake proning in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 may improve oxygenation, and 125 in come cases avoid intubation (29-31). Both of these patient positions will optimize the 126 operators ability to scan both the posterior and/or lateral lung fields with less exposure POCUS can offer important data, which can aid in clinical decision-making 131 in cases of COVID-19, there are limitations to this tool. Lung POCUS does require a certain 132 amount of operator experience and training to perform, and in inexperienced hands can lead to 133 misinterpretation. Additionally, evidence correlating POCUS findings with either diagnosis or 134 prognosis of COVID-19 is lacking. Thus, all lung POCUS findings in patients with suspected 135 COVID-19 must be correlated with the clinical picture overall. 136 While the ultimate scope of the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear, taking steps to minimize 140 healthcare-associated spread is key to limiting its trajectory. As a powerful tool for evaluating 141 patients with acute dyspnea, there certainly remains a role for lung POCUS in the current clinical 142 environment. However, given that lung POCUS now confers potential risk to providers and 143 patients in the form of nosocomial disease spread, developing protocols and policies which 144 minimize risk while maximizing clinical utility are paramount.
