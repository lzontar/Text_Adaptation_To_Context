This is in sharp contrast to observations of a very rapid spread of the virus in confined situations as prisons or cruise ships and the high rate of healthcare-associated infections. Several hypotheses will have to be explored to answer at least some of the questions: (1) initial estimates of R 0 might have been biased by clusters of effective transmission (\"super-spreaders\"), (2) public health measures might be more effective to reduce R t in SARS-CoV-2 than in influenza outbreaks and (3) whether there is a threshold of prevalent cases in the community, which if reached, the epidemic can be effectively contained only with drastic measures.",

China's success might not be the end of their outbreak. An attack rate as low as 2% could cause a second wave rapidly, because the community level of immunity is still low. Furthermore, the virus has been imported in a large number of countries, which are facing difficult choices regarding public health measures and challenges to their health care system. The outbreak in Hubei province has shown how much harm a newly emerging respiratory virus can cause. Infections in confined spaces, such as prisons or cruise ships, can rapidly spread, complications can be severe and health careassociated transmission poses a risk for HCWs and other patients. Health care workers from all over China have come to Hubei to help and have been doing excellent and very trying work in treating the large number of patients with a very high number of hospitalized and critically ill patients. Their growing experience in patient care is also reflected in the declining case fatality rate and the declining number of healthcare-associated transmission over the time course of the outbreak. The resulting publications of clinical data will be very helpful for patient care outside Hubei province and as clinicians we will profit immensely from those. But we do not know how the situation in Hubei might have been if the virus had spread early to other metropolitan centers in China. The workload for healthcare workers would have been multiplied, a collapse of the healthcare system would have been possible and the death toll would have been very high. In the light of these consequences, any public health intervention seems to be a better option.",

Outside China, we face enormous challenges: (1) to effectively contain the current and future outbreaks worldwide, and (2) to treat infected patients effectively and safely. Looking at the Chinese experience, we hope that public health measures outside China will be as rapid and effective as in China. We should implement those before reaching a critical threshold of infections.",
