In other words, apparent epidemics, adjusted for population 195 size, would be expected to be smaller in countries with younger populations simulated the mainland China epidemic in other countries, we found 200 that at any threshold of deaths required for outbreak detection, outbreaks 201 would be detected more quickly in countries with high life expectancy, and 202 more slowly in those with low life expectancy (Figure 2 and Online Appendix 203 (https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/time_to_outbreak_detection/). COVID-19 pandemic has expanded its reach, the role of unrecognized 209 infection has received increased scrutiny (2, 15). While individuals with 210 unrecognized infection may be important in the epidemic's spread, those with 211 more severe illness are more likely to be recognized clinically, and more likely to 212 be referred for virological testing, a practice which the age distribution of 213 identified cases in China early in the pandemic, foretold (8). 214 215 Age-related increases in severity, which may be confounded by increasing 216 prevalence of chronic medical conditions with age, are now well described in 217 countries outside China (16, 17). Greater recognition of individuals with more 218 severe illness, and undercounting of those with mild infection, is likely to inflate 219 apparent case fatality. While serological testing will ultimately help determine 220 the true infection fatality ratio for COVID-19, estimates of undercounting may 221 be derived if it is assumed that all in the population, regardless of age, are 222 equally vulnerable to infection.

While case-fatality is 246 driven at least in part by the extent of testing, standardizing these epidemics to 247 different populations (in effect, letting an identical epidemic run out in a 248 different population) allows us to see that demographic structure alone can 249 explain many between country differences in apparent epidemic size and case 250fatality.
