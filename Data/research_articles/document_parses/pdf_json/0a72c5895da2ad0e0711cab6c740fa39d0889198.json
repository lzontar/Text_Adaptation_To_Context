At admission, nasopharyngeal swabs sample were taken and PCR analysis confirmed SARS-CoV-2RNA positivity. On day 9 after admission, chest CT scan showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in patient's bilateral lungs. On day 11, his respiratory symptoms worsened. Subsequently, type 1 respiratory failure was diagnosed, coinciding with kidney injury, and subsequently, type 2 respiratory failure occurred, coupled with multi-organ failure including heart and liver. However, patient constitution worsened although SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative since day 13. He died on day 21. Lung biopsy showed areas of diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by extensive acute alveolitis with numerous intraalveolar neutrophils, lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrations. Microthrombi were seen in the dilated pulmonary capillaries. Immunohistochemistry stainings for SARS-CoV-2-N protein was negative. Taken together, the patient died of multiorgan failure although the SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared already, implicating that for disease worsening, no active SARS-CoV-2 infection is required.",

Although steroid therapy is useful to prevent a cytokine storm, it inhibits immune responses to pathogen infections (as might have occurred). As shown in Table 1 , lymphocyte numbers in the patient were impressively less, in particular since initiation of steroid therapy. In addition, high dosage of methylprednisolone treatment led to deleterious pneumonia. Given the missed diagnosis of the potential bacterial infection, antibiotics treatment was started too later in this patient, which might have resulted in multi-organ failure due to a septic shock.",

High magnification microscopy highlighted extensive areas of acute alveolitis with numerous intra-alveolar neutrophils and some lymphoid cells and alveolar macrophages (Fig2B). Intra-alveolar fibrinous exudates with inflammatory cells were present (Fig3A). Hyaline membranes were seen along the surface of the alveolar septa (arrows in Fig3B). The alveoli collapsed and fused along with the widened alveolar septum. Proliferating fibroblasts surrounded by neutrophils were observed in the alveolar septum (Fig3C). In distinct alveolar septa, pulmonary capillaries were dilated by microthrombi (arrow in Fig3D). Alongside with alveolar septa, hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells was seen (Fig4A). IHC staining for TTF-1 further showed that these type II pneumocytes were characterized as increased in nuclear size, hyperchromasia and mutinucleated giant cell (Fig4B).No granulomas and virus inclusion were seen in these tissues. IHC staining for anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein was negative. PAS, GMS and CMV IHC staining were negative (data not shown), excluding secondary fungi or CMV infection.",
