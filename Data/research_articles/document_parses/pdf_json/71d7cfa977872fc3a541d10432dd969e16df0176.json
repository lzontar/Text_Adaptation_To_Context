In South Africa, for instance, which is categorized as a developing, Global South country (with small sections of the economy having a Global North character), only a small percentage of the population ever receive career counseling. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) (2019), during the third quarter of 2019, the official unemployment rate in South Africa increased to 29.1%.

Interest in qualitative (storied) approaches together with quantitative (objective) approaches has increased significantly in their use in individual contexts (Hartung & Santili, 2018) . However, despite the fact that postmodern approaches have begun to gain traction during the past three decades in developed (Global North) countries, the traditional style of career counseling, based on the interpretation of test results and the recommendation of a few fields of study by an 'expert' career counselor, still prevails in large parts of Global South, underdeveloped countries especially. Besides, traditional career counseling still serves a useful purpose in developing, less affluent, third world countries, especially because very few of these countries have as yet made the \"narrative turn\". This \"turn\" can be described as the transition from using tests in career counseling to helping people identify and describe who they really are by articulating their career-lives in words (Hartung, 2013a (Hartung, , 2013b White & Epston, 1990) . However, the traditional approach to career counseling still predominates even in many affluent, primarily first world (Global North) countries. Furthermore, insufficient research has been done on the viability of group-based career counseling intervention, self-and career construction, and life design intervention (in developing countries in particular). This is the case even though drawing on group-based career counseling models is key to meeting the career counseling needs of large numbers of people who currently have little or no access to any career counseling.

Some of the pressing challenges workers and work-seekers will increasingly experience include blending their work and life roles, becoming and remaining employable (Savickas & Porfeli, 2012) , becoming and remaining career resilient (Maree, 2017a (Maree, , 2017b , and becoming and remaining career agile to retain and enhance their employability. Finding a way somehow to stay relevant in the rapidly shifting and changing occupational world will therefore require revisiting and renegotiating the contracts between employees and employers and ensuring that the criterion of \"facilitating sustainable decent work for every worker\" supersedes all other considerations. This lofty aim is achievable, but it depends on if and how much we want to achieve it. Each of us is capable of contributing in this regard in seemingly unrelated contexts. I, personally, value obtaining information from workers in lowly work situations (and even jobless people) such as waiters, cleaners, newspaper vendors, postmen, security people, farm workers, shop assistants, cashiers, and domestic workers. My questions normally revolve around those aspects of their work they enjoy most and those they enjoy least. I also try to find out what it is about their jobs that makes them believe they are (or are not) doing meaningful work-why or why not they believe their work enhances their overall sense of living a purposeful life and makes them feel wanted, appreciated, acknowledged, or worth something in the workplace. Then, I ask them what they really want to do in life: What will make them happy and feel that their work-life is meaningful and purposeful. Their responses unfailingly humble and inspire me. Many of them, for instance, want to become teachers, nurses, social workers, lawyers, medical doctors, electricians, architects, and engineers. Their reasons for not having pursued their dreams differ, but a few common themes run through their collective responses. First, they feel that circumstances beyond their control prevented them from pursuing their desired career-lives, such as poverty, lacking the money to enroll in and pursue a field of study, and having had to take care of an ailing family member, usually a parent. Second, most of them want to do work they consider more professional-work that will make them feel proud of themselves and earn the respect of others. Third, they experience feelings of sadness, unfulfilment, frustration, and being \"trapped\" in an unsatisfactory work situation. Fourth, they experience little or no work satisfaction. Fifth, the money they earn is often regarded as less important than a sense of \"belonging\" where they work and being made to feel \"wanted\" in their workplace.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 229, "end": 255, "text": "(Savickas & Porfeli, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 298, "end": 311, "text": "(Maree, 2017a", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 312, "end": 327, "text": "(Maree, , 2017b", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Association Between Successive Waves in Career"}, {"text": "In most cases, though, a brief counseling for self-and career construction discussion with these workers is enough to bring about a change in their lives, to ignite processes that promote the rewriting of their life stories, redesigning their lives, and setting them on a career trajectory that can enhance their sense of personal and social meaning in their lives. The following example illustrates this point. About a year ago, I was on a visit to the little town of Hazyview, Mpumalanga; a seriously disadvantaged, impoverished part of South Africa where I am collaborating with colleagues from the Good Work Foundation (GWF) to assess the effectiveness of a postmodern life design intervention on the career adaptability and decision-making capacity of impoverished and unemployed people. Staying at a nearby guesthouse, I was one morning served breakfast by a humble and friendly young woman. In response to my question about how she felt about her work, she said that she was working at the guesthouse because she desperately needed money as she could not afford to apply for admission to and study at a tertiary training institution. Asked what she wanted to do, her eyes lit up when she said, \"I want to become a nurse\". A brief interview with her after hours confirmed that she was interested in and might become a nurse to enact her key life themes. Asked further whether she had heard about the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETA) system, she shook her head. I scribbled the contact details of the Health SETA on a piece of paper.

The outstanding feature of this period is rapid technological and artificial intelligence advances, including robotization (Salimi, 2015) . In line with these advances, the language of the career counseling discourse has also changed (see Chap. 6). Many communication and computer technology developments were and still are characterized by the loss of conventional jobs and the emergence of short-term work assignments, dejobbing, protean and boundaryless careers, increased connectivity and networking, and artificial intelligence. The attendant uncertainty, insecurity, and loss of work identity led to work trauma in many employees. During this period, life design intervention (the fourth helping model) emerged in Global North countries in particular.

Our approach to career counseling intervention is informed by the feature (e.g. identity) that is focused on at any given time. This focus shapes our intervention and co-determines how we administer career counseling in Photograph 4.1 Celebrating innovation and advancement a given context and at a given time. Providing context for our chosen career counseling approach and style (e.g. a \"test-and-tell\" approach or a life design approach) (Guichard, 2009; Savickas, 2011a; Savickas et al., 2009a Savickas et al., , 2009b Savickas et al., , 2009c Savickas et al., , 2009d is key to ensuring that the service we render is in the best interests of clients (Taber, Hartung, Briddick, Sensoy-Briddick, & Rehfuss, 2011) . Today, probably more than ever before, a sense of hope and purpose needs to be rekindled in clients in a world in which many people have lost hope in the future. People need to rediscover a sense of purpose and meaning in the face of the message that robots are replacing workers and at a time when \"work\" as we know it is losing meaning in occupational contexts that no longer \"hold\" workers in the way they used to. Traits such as integrity, autonomy, humility, and frugality were valued during the first economic wave, and, accordingly, work success was achieved through people's individual endeavors (Savickas, 1993) . During the second wave, following the example set by natural scientists, people working in the field of career counseling began to develop \"objective\" assessment instruments. The aim was to find a way to \"test\" people objectively to establish their personality traits (e.g. interests, aptitudes, and intelligence). It was believed that testing or measuring was sufficient to obtain objective information that could predict people's success in given work environments for the duration of their career-lives. Intervention was aimed at establishing a satisfactory fit or match between people and their careers as it was thought this would ensure success in a career (Maree, 2013; Watson, McMahon, Mkhize, Schweitzer, & Mpofu, 2011) . During the third economic wave 4 the idea of \"making meaning\" in one's occupation or work began to emerge. The emphasis shifted from relying almost exclusively on measuring people's \"objective\" traits (Hergenhahn, 2005) to emphasizing their individuality, enhancing their career adaptability, improving their attitudes, developing their (self-)belief, and enhancing their competencies (ABCs). Today, career counseling emphasizes people as individuals and promotes understanding of their idiosyncratic situations rather than how they resemble or differ from one another (Byars-Winston, 2013) . Logical positivism (with its emphasis on how people resemble one another) as the predominant guiding theory was gradually replaced by subjective, existential-humanistic approaches (with their emphasis on people themselves and their distinctiveness) (Hergenhahn, 2005; Lent, 1996) . The pendulum thus swung from measuring people's \"objective\", \"fixed\" traits towards revealing their unique style of seeing things (constructing reality). Helping people not only move forward but actually take the action needed to bring about therapeutically relevant change in their lives and advance their sense of who they are began to take center stage in career counseling (Rogers, 1942; Seligman, 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 268, "text": "(Salimi, 2015, p. 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 712, "end": 728, "text": "(Guichard, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 729, "end": 745, "text": "Savickas, 2011a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 746, "end": 768, "text": "Savickas et al., 2009a", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 769, "end": 793, "text": "Savickas et al., , 2009b", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 794, "end": 818, "text": "Savickas et al., , 2009c", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 819, "end": 843, "text": "Savickas et al., , 2009d", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 926, "end": 986, "text": "(Taber, Hartung, Briddick, Sensoy-Briddick, & Rehfuss, 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1593, "end": 1609, "text": "(Savickas, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2288, "text": "(Maree, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2289, "end": 2340, "text": "Watson, McMahon, Mkhize, Schweitzer, & Mpofu, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2562, "text": "(Hergenhahn, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2912, "end": 2933, "text": "(Byars-Winston, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3185, "end": 3203, "text": "(Hergenhahn, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3204, "end": 3215, "text": "Lent, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3595, "end": 3609, "text": "(Rogers, 1942;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 3610, "end": 3625, "text": "Seligman, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Influence of Contemporaneous \"Business Models\" on Career Counseling Helping Models and the Foregrounding of Certain Personality Traits (Savickas, 2006a, 2006b; Maree & Morgan, 2012)"}, {"text": "The trend that emerged during the third economic wave, namely an increased emphasis on people's identity (Who am I?
