We have previously demonstrated that some rotavirus strains, like UK, Wa, WI61, DS-1, and YM, require the cation-dependent (CD-) M6PR and cathepsins to enter from late endosomes to the cytoplasm in MA104 cells, while other strains, like the simian strain RRV, which enter cells from maturing endosomes, do not. However, the role of other trans-Golgi network-late endosome transporters, such as the cation-independent (CI-) M6PR and sortillin-1, has not been evaluated. In this work, we found that several rotavirus strains that require the CD-M6PR for cell entry are also dependent on CI-M6PR and sortilin-1. Furthermore, we showed that the infectivity of all these rotavirus strains also requires cathepsins to enter not only MA104 cells, but also human intestinal Caco-2 cells. This study identifies sortilin-1 as a novel cell factor necessary for the infectivity of a virus; in addition, our results strongly suggest that cathepsins could be common cell factors needed for the infectivity of most rotavirus strains.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Rotaviruses, members of the family Reoviridae, are non-enveloped viruses and major etiologic agents of viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide (Parashar et al., 2003) . These viruses are composed of a triple-layered protein capsid that surrounds the viral genome, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the viral capping enzyme. The outermost layer is composed by the glycoprotein VP7 that forms the smooth surface of the virus, and the spike protein VP4 that functions as the virus attachment protein (L\u00f3pez and Arias, 2006) . Trypsin treatment of rotavirus is essential for virus cell entry, resulting in the specific cleavage of VP4 to yield the products VP8 and VP5 (Arias et al., 1996; Clark et al., 1981; Espejo et al., 1981; Estes et al., 1981; L\u00f3pez et al., 1985) . It has been proposed that VP4 undergoes conformational changes during the entry process leading to conversion of the mature infectious rotavirus triple-layer particles (TLPs) into transcriptionally active double-layered particles (DLPs) that start transcribing the viral genome in the cytosolic compartment (Dormitzer et al., 2004; Trask et al., 2010; Yoder et al., 2009 ).

It is known that the infectivity of the EP-rotavirus RRV in Caco-2 cells, as well as the LP-rotaviruses Wa and DS-1, depend on several ESCRT components (Silva-Ayala et al., 2013) , suggesting that these rotavirus strains follow a vesicular traffic after their internalization by endocytosis. To investigate if cathepsins are necessary for rotavirus infection of Caco-2 cells, we evaluated the role of these cysteine-proteases on the infectivity of EP-rotaviruses (RRV and SA11-4S) and LP-rotaviruses (UK, Wa and YM) using a pharmacological approach (Fig. 4) . ReoT1L was also used as positive control for these assays. As expected, the infectivity of ReoT1L in cells treated with leupeptin (Fig. 4A) , as well as with cathepsin B and (Fig. 4B ) cathepsin L (Fig. 4C) inhibitors was decreased by about 80%, 40%, and 90% respectively.
