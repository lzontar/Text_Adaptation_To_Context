            "text": "The selectin family adhesion molecules exert a crucial role in accumulation of leukocytes at the site of inflammation. To test the biological effects of soluble selectin on lung inflammation, we introduced an expression plasmid vector of soluble selectin gene via HVJ-liposome into a murine model of LPS-induced lung injury. The myeloperoxidase activity in LPS-injected mice was suppressed by the in vivo injection of soluble P-selectin gene relative to control mice. On the contrary, soluble E-or L-selectin genes did not exert suppressive effects. Our observations suggest that P-selectin plays a crucial role in the initial steps of lung inflammation, and exogenous introduction of soluble P-selectin by in vivo gene transfer method may be a useful strategy for regulating inflammation of the lung.",

            "text": "Inflammatory reactions play a critical role in host defense mechanisms, but excessive and sustained inflammation leads to various illnesses. In the lung, endotoxemia, aspiration pneumonia or exposure to an elevated concentration of oxygen induces serious pathologic inflammatory reactions, such as acute lung injury (ALI) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The pathogenesis of ALI or ARDS has not been fully clarified, but it is suggested that excessive accumulation of activated neutrophils and release of oxygen radicals, proteinases and arachidonic acid derivatives from the cells are crucial to the pathophysiology of the diseases (1) . To ameliorate the lung injury, trials to regulate activity of oxygen radicals and arachidonic acid derivatives have been successfully conducted (1, 2) . The outcomes of ALI and ARDS have improved, but the mortality rate is still high (3) . Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the therapeutic effects of new strategies. One potential strategy may be anti-adhesion therapy. Leukocyte accumulation takes place in the initial step of inflammation, and regulation of this step may potentially regulate the cascade leading to lung injury (4) (5) (6) . In inflammatory responses, adhesion molecules and humoral factors are involved in accumulation of leukocytes (7, 8) . The initial steps in leukocyte emigration in response to inflammation involve 1) rolling, 2) adhesion, and 3) transmigration. In rolling, leukocytes intermittently adhere to vascular endothelial cells by interaction between members of the selectin family of cell surface adhesion molecule and their ligands. The selectin family includes L-, E-, and P-selectins. L-selectin is expressed constitutively on the majority of leukocytes, and the counter-receptors of L-selectin on endothelial cells are sialomucin glycoproteins, GlyCAM-1, CD34 and MAdCAM-1. E-selectin is expressed on the cell surface of the activated endothelial cells, and P-selectin is found on activated endothelial cells and platelets. The counter-molecules of E-and P-selectin have structural features of sialylated Lewis X (sLeX), and they are designated E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1) and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), respectively (9, 10) . Introduction of anti-selectin antibodies or selectin-IgG chimera molecules inhibited the various types of experimental lung injuries (11) (12) (13) (14) . These observations suggest that inhibition of binding of selectins to their counter-molecules may prevent lung injury. Hence, introduction of soluble selectin molecules may regulate leukocyte accumulation, thus inhibiting it. In this study, we introduced the expression vector of soluble selectin genes into the murine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury (14) by hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome (15) , which is an effective in vivo gene transfer method. To evaluate in vivo the anti-inflammatory effects of this strategy, we tested various parameters of lung inflammation.",

As previously reported, selectin family molecules have a principal role in leukocyte accumulation at the site of inflammation. The evidence suggests that P-selectin is the most essential of the selectin family molecules for lung injury induced by LPS. In our experimental system, dramatic reduction in leukocyte accumulation was observed 3 h after LPS injection, and it did not persist more than 7 h. These results suggest that P-selectin exerts its activity in the early stages of inflammation. Mayadas et al. reported that P-selectin-deficient mice generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells exhibited virtually no leukocyte rolling in mesenteric venules, and delayed recruitment of neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity upon experimentally induced inflammation (21) . Our present investigation supports these findings on the role and biological characteristics of P-selectin.",

Hence, their biological role in inflammation is common to the selectin family, but each selectin has its own mode of expression (9, 17, 22) . L-selectin is constitutively expressed on the surface of leukocytes, and it is shed from the cell surface by the activation of protein kinase C (22) . Constitutive expression of E-selectin is minimal, although by stimulation with endotoxin or cytokine, its expression is induced on the surface of endothelial cells. The E-selectin mRNA expression is NF-kB dependent, and the level peaks 4 to 6 after stimulation (17) . P-selectin contrasts with these two classes of selectins. The transcription level of P-selectin is constitutive and the gene product is stored in Weibel-Palade bodies of the endothelial cells, or a-granules of platelets. By degranulation, P-selectin is expressed on the cell surface 2 to 5 min after stimulation by histamine or thrombin. The duration of expression is short and it rapidly disappears from the cell surface (9) . Evidence from earlier studies suggested that P-selectin regulates binding of leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells at the initial steps of inflammation. It may be pertinent that as the process of inflammation advances, de novo synthesized E-selectin is expressed, and the key molecule in inflammation may switch from P-selectin to E-selectin.",

The difference in the intensity of inhibitory effects may be explained in part by the amount of ligand. The principal ligand of P-selectin is PSGL-1, which is highly specific for P-selectin, and P-selectin weakly binds sLeX in the absence of PSGL-1. On the other hand, the specificity of E-, or L-selectin for the ligand is not as limited as P-selectin. E-selectin can bind to sLeX on various glycoproteins or glycolipids, and it can also bind to sLeX alone (9) , and L-selectin can bind to glycosylationdependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1), CD34 or MAdCAM-1 (9) . This evidence suggests that excess amount of ligand for E-or L-selectins may be present at the site of inflammation. The amount of ligand expressed by our gene transfer system may not have been enough to inhibit the activities of E-or L-selectin. It has also been reported that soluble forms of E-selectin directly promote neovascularization at the site of inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis, malignant tumor or healing site of a wound by binding sugar chain (23) . This observation suggests that soluble selectin does not act as antagonist for E-selectin. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the soluble E-selectin can act as antagonist.",

Moreover, by flowcytometric analysis, human P-selectin was detected on the cell surface of murine leukocytes. These findings suggest that human soluble selectin binds to ligand on the surface of murine leukocytes. Thus the major mechanism of suppression of leukocyte accumulation in the lungs by soluble P-selectin may be competitive inhibition of the P-selectin ligand. However, the contribution of molecules other than P-selectin has not been ruled out by our study, and further investigation is needed. Investigation of the selectin family, and the strategy of in vivo soluble selectin gene introduction may lead to development of a new field of antiinflammatory therapy in the lung.",
