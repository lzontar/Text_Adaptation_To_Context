Filter efficiency is tested by assessing the proportion of a 300 nm (0.3 mm) aerosol challenge, which is filtered by the device. To understand the nomenclature mentioned in the following table, for example, a FFP2 filter will prevent at least 94% of the aerosol challenge from passing through.

N95 masks are recommended for medium risk clinical encounters. For high-risk encounters, positive pressure suits are recommended. 2, 5 Many of the re-useable commercially available Facemasks (respirators) for protection during spray painting/woodwork/industrial fumes are FFP3/P3 category and would offer protection against a heavy viral aerosol challenge.
