Even if we restrict attention to t-norm based logics, where a left continuous t-norm \u2022 serves as truth function for conjunction and the (unique) residuum of \u2022 models implication, there are still infinitely many different fuzzy logics to choose from. Almost all of these logics feature truth functions that yield values that are in general different from 0 and 1, but also different from each argument value. E.g., the function f (x) = 1 \u2212 x often serves as truth function for negation. However, if we take the minimum, min(x, y), as t-norm modeling conjunction \u2227, the corresponding residuum as truth function for implication \u2192, and define the negation by \u00acA = A \u2192 \u22a5 1 , we arrive at G\u00f6del logic, where every formula evaluates to either 0, 1, or to the value of one of the propositional variables occurring in it. Moreover, G\u00f6del logic is the only t-norm based fuzzy logic, where whether a formula is true (i.e., evaluates to 1) does not depend on the particular values in [0, 1] that interpret the propositional variables, but only on the order 2 of these values.",

After explaining, in Sect. 2, for the simple case of classical logic restricted to negation, conjunction, and disjunction, how a semantic game may be turned into a calculus for proving validity, we turn to G\u00f6del logic G (and its extension G with the -operator) in Sect. 3 . We introduce a truth degree comparison game, where a player P seeks to uphold, against attacks by opponent O, a claim of the form F < G or F \u2264 G, expressing that the truth value of F is smaller (or equal) to that of G under a given interpretation. The interaction of P and O stepwise reduces the initial truth comparison claim to an atomic claim that can be immediately checked. In Sect. 5, we lift the game from truth degree comparison claims for concrete interpretations to the level of validity, i.e., to comparison claims that hold under every interpretation. Following the general clue given in Sect. 2, the key ingredient is the notion of disjunctive states, triggering disjunctive strategies. It turns out that disjunctive winning strategies for P correspond to proofs in an analytic proof system, called sequents-of-relations calculus, introduced in [6] . We conclude in Sect. 6 by a brief summary of our results, followed by suggestions for future research in this area.",

There are two players, say You and I , who, at any state of the game, can either be in the role of a proponent P or in the role of an opponent O with respect to the claim that a current formula F is true in a given interpretation J . The game starts with You in role O and me (player I ) in role P. It proceeds in accordance with the following rules, which refer to the players only via their current roles. It is straightforward to show that I , the initial P, have a winning strategy in the game for formula F and interpretation J iff F is true under J . The game thus characterizes the fundamental notion of truth in a model (interpretation). The just described semantic game can be turned into a provability game by lifting its states to disjunctive states. By this we mean that any state of the provability game consists of a disjunction of states of the semantic game. At any disjunctive state I pick one disjunct where the current formula is nonatomic. If all formulas are atomic, we have reached a final disjunctive state of the provability game. We call such a disjunctive state winning (for me, i.e., player I ) if for every interpretation there is at least one disjunct (state) where I win.",

The rules of the provability game may then be denoted as follows, where D denotes a, possible empty, disjunction of component states. In these rules, the component state exhibited in the lower disjunctive state is the one picked by me. Notice that a branching into two disjunctive successor states (premises of the rule) only occurs if You has to move in the underlying semantic game. In contrast, if I am to move, the component state picked by me splits into two states, i.e., into two components (disjuncts) of the given disjunctive state.",

If one translates the labels 'I'/'You' as 'to the right/left of the sequent arrow', respectively, one indeed arrives at the rules introducing conjunction, disjunction, and negation in the classical sequent calculus LK (or more precisely, its variant G3 without structural rules [18] ).

Clearly the structural rules of LK, namely permutation, weakening, and contraction, remain sound in the interpretation of sequents as disjunctive game states. Winning strategies in the provability game thus translate into LK proofs. We suggest that the sketched transformation of a semantic game into a provability game via moving from single states (referring to particular interpretations) into disjunctive states (referring to all possible interpretations) can be seen as a general principle, rather than a trick that works only for (a fragment of) propositional CL. An arguably more interesting case of this transformation has been worked out in [10] for (infinite-valued) Lukasiewicz logic L: Taking Giles' game for L [11, 12] as a starting point on the semantic level, we arrive at disjunctive states that can be interpreted as hypersequents. Indeed, as shown in [10] , one can systemically derive the logical rules of the hypersequent calculus H L, originally introduced in [16] , in this manner.",

If the height of \u03c3 is 1, then F \u00a1 G is atomic, and since \u03c3 is a ws, F \u00a1 G must therefore be a winning state of \u03c4 J \u03c1 [F \u00a1 G]. Hence J |= F \u00a1 G. Now assume that the height of \u03c3 is at least 2, and let S 1 , . . . , S n be the successor claims of F \u00a1 G in \u03c4 J \u03c1 [F \u00a1 G] which are contained in \u03c3. Since \u03c3 is a strategy for P, the set {S 1 , . . . , S n } is a P-power of \u03c4 J \u03c1 [F \u00a1 G]. Now for each i \u2264 n, let \u03c3 i be the subtree of \u03c3 with root S i . Then each \u03c3 i is a ws for P in \u03c4 J \u03c1 [S i ], and so by induction hypothesis J |= S i for every i \u2264 n. We have thus shown that all claims in a P-power of \u03c4 J \u03c1 [F \u00a1 G] are satisfied by J , and so by Proposition 1 it follows that J satisfies F \u00a1 G. Proof. If J satisfies F \u00a1 G, then by Proposition 1 there is a power X \u2208 Pow(F \u00a1 G) (where the marking in F \u00a1 G is set according to \u03c1) such that J satisfies all claims in X. So P can enforce that the successor state of F \u00a1 G in the game \u03c4 J \u03c1 [F \u00a1 G] is contained in X. Repeating the same kind of reasoning, we see that P can always move ensuring that the resulting game state is satisfied by J , and in particular, any atomic state \u03bd reached using this strategy will be a winning state in \u03c4 J \u03c1 [F \u00a1 G] for P.",

In Sect. 4, we presented a game for reducing truth degree comparison claims F < G or F \u2264 G, i.e., claims about the relative order of arbitrary G -formulas, to atomic comparison claims. This amounts to a generalization of Hintikka's well known semantic game for classical logic. As illustrated in Sect. 2 for the simple case of classical propositional logic, semantic games can be systematically lifted to provability games. The latter operate on the level of validity rather than the level of truth in a model and thus correspond to analytic proof systems. Indeed, Gentzen's sequent system for classical logic can be interpreted from a game perspective in this manner. In Sect. 5, we have applied this general scheme to the more involved case of the truth degree comparison game and demonstrated that moving from single states to disjunctions of states yields a characterization of validity in G in terms of 'disjunctive winning strategies'. Moreover, disjunctions of states can be viewed as sequentsof-relations in the sense of [3, 6] . Hence, disjunctive winning strategies provide an interpretation of proofs in this calculus.",

While it has already been shown in [10] that a similar approach relates Giles's game for Lukasiewicz logic to a corresponding hypersequent calculus, it remains open whether and how this method can be extended to yet further fuzzy logics. Even for G\u00f6del logic itself, one may ask whether not only sequents-of-relations but also the arguably better known hypersequent calculus HLC of Avron [1] can be systematically related to a truth degree comparison game. This might also open the way to generalize to the first order level, since in contrast to the sequents-of-relations calculus, HLC can straightforwardly be extended to include quantifier rules. Due to its attractiveness for certain applications, an extension of G\u00f6del logic featuring an involutative negation, in addition to standard G\u00f6del-negation, has received some attention [8] . In future work we plan to extend our truth degree comparison games to include also this type of negation. Finally, we like to point out that a game based approach to fuzzy logics may open the route to more sophisticated models of reasoning under vagueness than can be achieved by sticking with truth functional logics. It is natural to ask what happens if the players of a game have only imperfect information about their opponent's moves. For classical logic this leads to Independence Friendly (IF) logic of Hintikka and Sandu [15] . Given the fact that vagueness may be seen as a phenomenon involving a lack of full share of (precise) information between speaker and hearer of vague statements, it seems attractive to explore the impact of imperfect information on truth degree comparison games.",

For non-atomic F \u00a1G, this is proved for all 12 types of game states seperately. Consider for example the state A \u2192 B \u2264 C and its P-power{{ \u2264 C}, {B < A, B \u2264 C}}.Let J \u2208 Int [0,1] . Then either A J \u2264 B J , in which case A \u2192 B J = 1 and so J satisfies the claim A \u2192 B \u2264 C iff J satisfies \u2264 C. Or A J > B J : Then A \u2192 B J = B J and so J satisfies the claim A \u2192 B \u2264 C iff J satisfies B \u2264 C. We prove the equivalence for the other two examples given above.
