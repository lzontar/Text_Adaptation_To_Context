It is noteworthy that the evolution of psychological problems is a developmental process. After short-term medical support work for COVID-19 control, the effects of various psychological stressors may be strengthened, and psychological problems will gradually emerge. The onset of psychological crisis is commonly 3 months after the end of medical support work, and its peak is approximately 6 months later (Hsiao et al., 2020) . Therefore, even though the COVID-19 epidemic is over, it is of great importance to continue tracking the development of vicarious traumatization in medical staff as well as the general public.",
