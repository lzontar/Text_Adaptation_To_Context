Soluble PDGFR\u03b1 potently neutralizes HCMV in tissue culture, and its potential use as an antiviral therapeutic has the benefit that any escape mutants will likely be attenuated. However, PDGFR\u03b1 binds multiple PDGF ligands in the human body as part of developmental programs in embryogenesis and continuing through adulthood. Any therapies with soluble receptor therefore come with serious efficacy and safety concerns, especially for the treatment of congenital HCMV. Soluble virus receptors that are orthogonal to human biology might resolve these concerns. This engineering problem is solved by deep mutational scanning on the D2-D3 domains of PDGFR\u03b1 to identify variants that maintain interactions with the HCMV glycoprotein trimer in the presence of competing PDGF ligands. Competition by PDGFs is conformation-dependent, whereas HCMV trimer binding is independent of proper D2-D3 conformation, and many mutations at the receptor-PDGF interface are suitable for functionally separating trimer from PDGF interactions. Purified soluble PDGFR\u03b1 carrying a targeted mutation succeeded in displaying wild type affinity for HCMV trimer with a simultaneous loss of PDGF binding, and neutralizes trimer-only and trimer/pentamer-expressing HCMV strains infecting fibroblasts or epithelial cells. Overall, this work makes important progress in the realization of soluble HCMV receptors for clinical application.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV; or human herpesvirus 5, HHV-5) is a ubiquitous pathogen that has infected most of the global adult population, and typically causes asymptomatic infections [1, 2] . In some cases, individuals will experience mononucleosis-like symptoms, and severe disease can occur in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed adults [3] . HCMV infection may also have an oncomodulatory effect and could be associated with tumor progression, most notably in glioblastoma [4] [5] [6] [7] , although the mechanistic details remain controversial [8] . However, it is amongst pregnant women and newborns that HCMV has a disproportionate impact on public health [9] . Just over 1 in 200 infants born in the United States are congenitally infected with HCMV, and approximately a fifth of these infants will suffer life-long neurological complications [10, 11] , including hearing and vision loss, seizures, behavioral disorders, and developmental delays [12] [13] [14] [15] . Ideally, infection during pregnancy would be avoided, but this is challenging. The high prevalence of HCMV (especially in families with young children [16, 17] ), easy transmission through contact with bodily fluids, recurrence of latent endogenous infections [18] , reinfection by different exogenous strains [19] , and difficulties recognizing asymptomatic infected individuals make controlling virus spread difficult. Furthermore, antivirals have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine use in the treatment of congenital HCMV where there are unique concerns regarding toxicity, and drug resistance is widely reported [20] . Faced with this reality, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not make any specific recommendations for counseling or treating pregnant women for the prevention of HCMV [21] .",

            "text": "It is in this environment that the discovery of an important HCMV receptor, the plateletderived growth factor receptor \u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1), has generated excitement towards the development of new therapeutics inhibiting virus-host cell attachment and entry. Two glycoprotein complexes on the HCMV surface drive broad host cell tropism [22] . A pentameric complex of glycoprotein H (gH; UL75), gL (UL115), UL128, UL130 and UL131A mediates entry into epithelial and endothelial cells [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , possibly through engagement of neuropilin-2 [29] or the olfactory receptor OR14I1 [30] on the host cell. A trimeric complex of gH, gL and gO (UL74) is sufficient for entry into fibroblasts and is also necessary for entry into pentamer-requiring cell types by promoting membrane fusion [31] [32] [33] . Multiple lines of evidence indicate that PDGFR\u03b1 is the receptor for the trimer. Decreased PDGFR\u03b1 expression reduces HCMV entry into fibroblasts [34] [35] [36] [37] ; gO can specifically bind PDGFR\u03b1-expressing cells [36] ; a quaternary complex of soluble extracellular regions (gH-gL-gO-PDGFR\u03b1) can be assembled in vitro and the components bind with high nanomolar affinity [29, 34] ; HCMV strains lacking the trimer fail to enter PDGFR\u03b1-dependent cell types to infect cells [36, 38] ; and the soluble PDGFR\u03b1 extracellular domain blocks virus entry [29, 36, 38] . This has led to the soluble domain of PDGFR\u03b1 or derivative fragments being explored as antivirals [34, 36, 38] , a promising strategy as any mutations in HCMV to escape receptor-based inhibitors would likely decrease binding to the natural receptor and attenuate virulence. Soluble PDGFR\u03b1 ectodomain effectively blocks virus entry whether applied pre-or post-cell attachment, due to inhibition of both early attachment and fusion steps [38] .

            "text": "While appealing, the use of soluble PDGFR\u03b1 to treat HCMV in humans comes with risk. Indeed, no protein-based viral receptors are currently approved as antiviral drugs by the FDA [39] (although at least one is in a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 by Apeiron Biologics), in part due to safety concerns over interactions with endogenous ligands. By comparison, there are multiple antibody drugs that are specific for viral targets used in the clinic [39] . PDGFR\u03b1 is an important receptor for platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), and regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation and development of multiple tissues during embryogenesis and onwards through adulthood [40] . The PDGF ligands are small polypeptides that covalently associate in disulfide-bonded homo-and heterodimers, which display differing activities towards PDGFR\u03b1 and its close relative PDGFR\u03b2 [41] . Four ligands interact with PDGFR\u03b1 with high affinity (PDGF-AA, AB, BB, and CC) [42, 43] and bind two receptor chains at opposing ends to form a receptor-(ligand) 2 -receptor signaling complex [44, 45] . PDGFs compete with the HCMV trimer for PDGFR\u03b1 binding and block infection [35, 36] , suggesting that PDGF binding to PDGFR\u03b1 sterically hinders trimer binding or allosterically modulates the trimer binding interface in a nonproductive manner. Treatment with soluble PDGFR\u03b1 will almost certainly disrupt physiological PDGF-signaling, and the ability of recombinant receptor to bind virions may be diminished by competing endogenous PDGFs. Ideally, mutations in the receptor can be identified that disrupt PDGF interactions while retaining the site or sites engaged by HCMV.",

However, the binding site for gO is ambiguous. Cryo-electron microscopy suffers from conformational diversity and low resolution [34] ; PDGFR\u03b1 peptide fragment analysis failed to discover any one peptide solely responsible for high affinity binding [38] ; and while domain deletions have shown PDGFR\u03b1-D3 is important [37] , such studies have coarse resolution.

By tracking the enrichment or depletion of sequence variants in a diverse library using next generation sequencing, the relative phenotypes of thousands of mutations can be simultaneously assessed in a single experiment, referred to as deep mutagenesis [46] . Deep mutational scans have been used to address and engineer specificity in proteins that promiscuously bind multiple ligands [47] [48] [49] , and methods for deep mutagenesis of membrane proteins expressed in human cells have been optimized [50] [51] [52] . By screening through all possible single amino acid substitutions in the D2-D3 domains, we discovered that, unlike PDGF binding, HCMV trimer interactions persist when PDGFR\u03b1 conformation is disrupted by mutations within the folded core. Particularly relevant to therapeutic design, we also identified PDGFR\u03b1 surface mutations that retain trimer binding in the presence of high PDGF concentrations. This study brings receptor-based inhibition of HCMV infection closer to realization.",

Medium from gH/gL/gO-sfGFP expressing cells was incubated with Expi293F cells transfected with an episomal plasmid encoding PDGFR\u03b1. Trimer binding was proportional to PDGFR\u03b1 surface expression (determined by flow cytometry using antibody staining of an extracellular c-myc epitope tag at the PDGFR\u03b1 N-terminus; Fig 1A and 1B) , and was inhibited by co-incubation with an equimolar mixture of PDGF-AA, AB, BB, and CC ( Fig  1D) .

Neat, no dilution. (B and C) Cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) PDGFR\u03b1 (B) or the D2-D3 SSM library (C) under conditions where typically no more than a single sequence variant is expressed by any given cell. Under these conditions, most cells are negative for PDGFR\u03b1 expression as determined by anti-myc staining. Cells were incubated with a subsaturating (12-fold dilution) of gH/gL/gO-sfGFP medium and analyzed by flow cytometry. (D) Cells were co-incubated with a 2-fold dilution of gH/gL/gO-sfGFP medium and different concentrations of PDGF (an equimolar mixture of PDGF-AA, AB, BB, and CC). The fluorescent signal of gH/gL/gO-sfGFP binding is compared to a sample without competing PDGF. (E and F) Cells expressing WT PDGFR\u03b1 (E) or the D2-D3 SSM library (F) were incubated with a 3-fold dilution of gH/gL/gO-sfGFP medium and 100 nM PDGF (25 nM of each subtype). The choice of a PDGF concentration that does not completely inhibit trimer binding ensured (i) that there remained some positive binding signal for drawing appropriate sort gates, and (ii) that mutations with weak effects will be distinguished from the main population. During sorting of the D2-D3 library, the top 15% of PDGFR\u03b1-expressing cells that bind trimer were collected (UL74-High sort, green gate). Simultaneously, the bottom 15% of PDGFR\u03b1-expressing cells that bind trimer were also collected (UL74-Low sort, blue gate). For cells expressing WT PDGFR\u03b1, the equivalent gates correspond to 4% and 23% of PDGFR\u03b1-expressing cells, respectively. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008647.g001",

When incubated with gH/gL/gO-sfGFP medium at subsaturating dilutions, cells expressing the SSM library were surprisingly indistinguishable from cells expressing wild-type PDGFR\u03b1 (Fig 1B and 1C) . Normally, many mutations adversely impact protein activity through destabilization of folded structure or damage to functional sites, and loss-of-function variants tend to dominate naive libraries prior to any selection.

            "text": "By comparison, many cells expressing the SSM library displayed higher trimer binding in the presence of PDGFs than cells expressing wild-type PDGFR\u03b1 (Fig 1E and 1F ). There thus appeared to be many PDGFR\u03b1 mutations that selectively lost PDGF affinity. To identify these mutations, PDGFR\u03b1-expressing cells that had elevated HCMV trimer binding in the presence of competing PDGFs were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This is referred to as the UL74-High sort (see green gate in Fig 1F) . Within the same experiment, cells expressing PDGFR\u03b1 but displaying low trimer binding were also collected, referred to as the UL74-Low sort (see blue gate in Fig 1F) . The UL74 gene encodes gO [31] , and the names assigned to the sorted populations correspond to the raw and processed data files deposited in the GEO database [57] . PDGFR\u03b1 mutants that lose affinity for trimer, or perhaps have enhanced affinity for competing PDGFs, will be preferentially enriched in the UL74-Low sort. PDGFR\u03b1 mutants that fail to express will be depleted from both sorted populations. PDGF interactions are uniquely sensitive to mutational disruption of folded structure in the D2-D3 domains Enrichment ratios for nonsynonymous mutations are anticorrelated between the UL74-High and UL74-Low sorts, with few mutations other than premature stop codons being depleted in both selections. Hence substitution mutations in PDGFR\u03b1 D2-D3 domains suffer little cost to surface localization, even though many mutations will almost certainly destabilize the domain fold. This differs markedly from a prior mutational scan of a multidomain membrane protein expressed in human cells, where nonconservative mutations buried within folded structure prevented protein trafficking to the plasma membrane due to intracellular retention by quality control machinery [50] . When mapping experimental conservation scores to the structure of PDGF-bound PDGFR\u03b1 (modeled from the crystal structure of PDGF-BB-bound PDGFR\u03b2; PDB ID 3MJG [44] ), enriched mutations in the UL74-High sort are found to cluster to buried core positions and the PDGF interface (Fig 2) . These include substitutions that create cavities, steric clashes, and/or introduce buried ionizable groups; these mutations are incompatible with biophysical principles governing protein folding and will destabilize folded structure. We hypothesize that PDGFR\u03b1 mutants with disrupted structure have therefore preferentially lost affinity to PDGFs, thereby reducing competition and enhancing binding of the HCMV trimer. The epitope bound by the HCMV trimer is ambiguous from the data (S3 Fig), but must be at least partially independent of proper D2-D3 conformation, although partial structure may remain. This is consistent with either key contacts to the HCMV trimer residing on linear PDGFR\u03b1 segments and loops, similar to how many antibodies recognize conformation-independent epitopes, or with favorable interactions to the HCMV trimer being distributed over a broad surface (possibly even beyond the D2-D3 domains) such that localized disruptions are tolerated. Libraries encompassing double or higher order PDGFR\u03b1 mutations may further resolve details of the binding mechanism. While this illuminates aspects of PDGFR\u03b1/trimer recognition, using misfolded, destabilized PDGFR\u03b1 variants to selectively neutralize HCMV is fraught with risks, including toxicity from non-specific interactions and protein aggregation due to the exposure of hydrophobic residues.

As predicted from the deep mutational scan, these PDGFR\u03b1 variants maintain near wild-type levels of binding to soluble HCMV trimer from the TB40/E strain, yet have diminished sensitivity to the addition of competing PDGFs (Fig 3A and 3B ), demonstrating successful engineering of specificity towards the viral target. Since the mechanism of trimer binding to receptor has not been resolved at atomic or even residue-level resolution, it remains uncertain whether the viral genome could mutate to distinguish wild-type from engineered PDGFR\u03b1. This concern is partially alleviated by the observation that the engineered PDGFR\u03b1 mutants maintain high binding to soluble HCMV trimer from the Merlin clinical strain [58] ( Fig 3C) , which has relatively high natural sequence variation compared to TB40/E (79% identity between glycoproteins O).

Multimerized Fc chains impose avidity for enhanced apparent affinity, and Fc moieties are engaged by multiple receptors to enhance serum half-life or evoke effector functions, including complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [59] . Soluble PDGFR\u03b1 fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 was shown to bind HCMV trimer when first identified as its receptor [34] , and the neutralization properties of Fc-fused soluble PDGFR\u03b1 (sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc) have been explored since in greater detail [38] . These prior studies used commercially supplied sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc featuring a random linker of mixed amino acids that connects to the upper hinge of IgG1, upstream of Cys-220 that would ordinarily form a disulfide to the antibody light chain (S5A Fig). The nature of this Fc fusion may cause manufacturing liabilities if Cys-220 is exposed and free, and we refer to this construct as \"legacy\" sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc. We designed an alternative sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc construct that includes the PDGFR\u03b1 signal peptide (a.a. 1-23), ectodomain (a.a. 24-524), a GGGS linker, and finally human IgG1 Fc beginning at Asp-221 (S5A Fig). Both sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc constructs bind membrane-localized HCMV trimer with equal affinity (Fig 3D and 3E) , and subsequent studies focused exclusively on our redesigned fusion protein.",

The Y206S mutant had reduced binding to HCMV trimer compared to wild-type receptor, but sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc V242K bound HCMV trimer from Merlin and TB40/E strains with equal low nanomolar affinity (Fig 3D and 3E ). Aspects of these experiments were replicated with independent protein preparations (S7A Fig). Furthermore, fusions of wild-type and V242K sPDGFR\u03b1 with the Fc region of IgG3 also bound similarly to trimer from the TB40/E and Merlin strains (S7B and S7C Fig) . Compared to IgG1, IgG3 has lower affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is associated with reduced serum half-life and placental transfer [61, 62] . We speculate that these features may be advantageous in the treatment of pregnant women during acute HCMV infection to achieve a lower dose in the developing fetus, thereby further addressing safety concerns.

Treatment with PDGFs upregulates EGFP-PEST expression, which is inhibited by wild-type sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc acting as a decoy receptor (Fig 4) . As intended, both sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc Y206S and V242K failed to inhibit PDGF signaling (Fig 4B) . However, we also noticed that the engineered receptors, in particular sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc Y206S, unexpectedly enhanced the response to PDGF-A ligands. We suspect this is due to a generic 'carrier protein' effect (PDGF ligands and their receptors are highly hydrophobic [44] and are generally formulated with a carrier such as serum albumin), though we are unable to conclude this with certainty, and non-specific gamma globulin has no such effect (S8 Fig). This observation may require future investigation. ",

Two highly relevant models are the study of rhCMV in rhesus macaques [71] or the engraftment of human tissues into immune-deficient mice [72] [73] [74] , but these are non-trivial and require specialized expertise. However, it might be possible to test biocompatibility and pharmacokinetics of the orthogonal receptors independent of infection in small animal models. For instance, murine and human PDGF ligands and receptors share high identity (> 85%, with all key binding site residues of PDGFR\u03b1 conserved), and one standard assessment of purified human PDGF ligands is to measure mitogenic activity towards mouse fibroblast lines [75, 76] . This suggests the human and mouse PDGF ligands and receptors will cross-react, though this has not been quantitatively characterized. Mice, especially strains expressing human FcRn for human-like serum stability of Fc fused protein [77, 78] , may therefore be a suitable model for assessing safety during future development.",

Deletion studies have show that the D3 domain is essential for trimer-mediated HCMV entry [37] , although no specific hot spot residues for mediating physical binding have been defined. It is possible that gO makes critical contacts to domains D4 or D5 that are outside the mutagenized region in the PDGFR\u03b1 D2-D3 library, or simply that negative effects of single amino acid substitutions in the D2-D3 domains are too small to cause an observable decrease in binding to HCMV trimer by flow cytometry. Determining how gO binds PDGFR\u03b1 at atomic resolution will be important for speculating on the likelihood of HCMV acquiring mutations to distinguish and escape from orthogonal receptors.",

The principles and approach outlined here can be easily adapted for the engineering of other viral receptors for improved efficacy and safety to treat or prevent infections. Indeed, the same methods we optimized for the development of a HCMV antiviral were rapidly repurposed for engineering soluble decoy receptors that bind with high affinity to the spike of SARS coronavirus 2, a zoonotic pathogen that recently spilled over to the human population and has profoundly impacted world events [82] . Receptor-based antiviral drugs may be especially desirable for emerging zoonotic viruses or viruses with high sequence diversity, as they potentially have broader specificity than monoclonal antibodies to target all virus strains that utilize a common receptor.",

For measuring signaling activity, a minimal promoter under the control of tandem serum response elements was subcloned from SRE reporter vector_559 (Addgene # 82686) [64] , a GFP-PEST fluorescent reporter [63] was inserted at the AscI site, and the entire reporter cassette was inserted at the NruI site of pCEP4-myc-PDGFR\u03b1 by Gibson assembly. As a negative control, human PDGFR\u03b2 isoform 1 (GenBank NM_002609.3) was similarly cloned between the NheI-XhoI sites of pCEP4 with a N-terminal HA leader, myc-tag, and linker that connects to the mature protein (a.a. 106) . No interactions between PDGFR\u03b2 and HCMV trimer were observed.

Alternatively, PDGFR\u03b1 a.a. 1-524 were fused via linker GGGS to D221-K447 of human IgG3 (GenBank P01860.2; this is an R435 allele with reduced binding to FcRn). Synthetic human codon-optimized gene fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies) for HCMV gO (GenBank ABV71596.1 for TB40/E strain, AJY56739.1 for Merlin strain) were genetically fused at the C-terminus to superfolder GFP [55] (for detection of soluble HCMV trimer binding to PDGFR\u03b1-positive cells) or to an 8-histidine tag (for expression of membrane-tethered HCMV trimer), and were ligated in to the NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+).

For production of soluble trimer, the extracellular region of gH with the leader peptide (a.a. 1-717 for TB40/E, a.a. 1-716 for Merlin) was subcloned with a 8-histidine tag.

The diversified region of PDGFR\u03b1 was PCR amplified as 3 fragments to provide full coverage of the D2-D3 domains during Illumina sequencing. During PCR, flanking sequences on the primers added adapters to the ends of the products for annealing to Illumina sequencing primers, unique barcoding, and for binding the flow cell. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using a 2\u00d7250 nt paired end protocol. Data were analyzed using Enrich [85] , and commands are provided in the GEO deposit. Briefly, the frequencies of PDGFR\u03b1 variants in the transcripts of the sorted populations were compared to their frequencies in the naive plasmid library to calculate an enrichment ratio.",

PDGF signaling was assessed in Expi293F cells transiently transfected with a PDGFR\u03b1 reporter plasmid as outlined in Fig 4A. A 3-fold molar excess of wild-type sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc (black) blocks 5 nM PDGF-AB signaling. Orthogonal engineered sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc V242K (white) does not block signaling and the mutation shows no interactions with PDGFs in competitive binding experiments (Fig 3) . Furthermore, wild-type or mutant sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc up to 100 nM shows no binding to PDGFR\u03b1positive cells, and we exclude unanticipated interactions between receptor chains. However, sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc V242K does cause an increase in signaling of PDGF-A ligands (AA and AB) for unknown reasons. A non-specific carrier effect in which the orthogonal receptor stabilizes the hydrophobic ligand in solution is suspected, especially because the more hydrophobic variant sPDGFR\u03b1-Fc Y206S promotes an even bigger increase in PDGF-A signaling (Fig 4B) .

Residue conservation scores in the UL74-High deep mutational scan were calculated by averaging the log 2 enrichment ratios for all 20 possible amino acids at each diversified position. PDGFR\u03b1 residues where mutations tend to increase HCMV trimer binding in the presence of competing PDGFs have higher positive scores. A residue's conservation score is correlated with its connectivity in the modeled PDGF-bound PDGFR\u03b1 structure, where connectivity is quantified by the number of neighboring residues within a 12 \u00c5 radius. Highly connected residues are either buried in the hydrophobic cores of the D2-D3 domains, or are buried at the PDGF binding interface.
