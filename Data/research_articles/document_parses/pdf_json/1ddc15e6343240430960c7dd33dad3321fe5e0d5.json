Results/methodology: Microwave promoted the synthesis of cycloalkyl amine substituted isoindoline-1,3-dione-4-aminoquinolines was urbanized for evaluating their antiplasmodial activities. Compound with the optimum combination of propyl chain length and hydroxyethyl piperazine proved to be the most potent among the synthesized scaffolds against chloroquineresistant W2 strain of Plasmodium falciparum with an IC 50 value of 0.006 \u03bcM. Heme-binding along with density functional theory studies were further carried out in order to delineate the mechanism of action of the most active compound. Conclusion: The synthesized scaffold can act as a therapeutic template for further synthetic modifications toward the search for a new antimalarial agent.",

There have been significant decreases in malaria morbidity and mortality in recent years, but advances appear to have stalled [6] . The 2018 report on malaria by the World Health Organization estimated 219 million cases of this disease in 2017. The top ten highest afflicted African countries witnessed an increase of 3.5 million cases in 2017 compared with the previous year. Malaria claimed an estimated 435,000 lives in 2017, largely in Africa [7] . In India, the burden of malaria is enormous. The country has the third-highest number of cases in the world and accounts for the highest malaria burden outside of Africa [6] .",

However, the emergence of artemisinin-tolerant P. falciparum strains in South-East Asia [11] and recently in Eastern India [12, 13] is of serious concern.

Isoindoline-1,3-dione is an important heterocyclic core, with a tendency to potentiate the activities of known antimalarials [23] . Rathi et al. recently reported the in vitro antimalarial activity of a series of isoindoline-1,3-diones functionalized with cyclic amines. Among them, the compound having a piperidinopiperidine group exhibited promising antimalarial activity with an IC 50 of 1.2 \u03bcM [24] . More recently [25] , we introduced an isoindoline ring system in the side chain of 4aminochloroquine to enhance activity. These analogs showed remarkable activity against CQ-resistant (CQR) P. falciparum. The compound bearing tetrabromo substituted isoindoline ring exhibited the highest potency (IC 50 0.1 \u03bcM) with low-cytotoxicity toward the normal cells ( Figure 1 ).",

The alkyl chain length along with the nature of secondary-amine at C4/C5 position of isoindoline-1,3-diones was varied in order to study the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the target molecules. Furthermore, heme-binding studies were performed through UV-visible absorption, mass spectrometry and 1 H-NMR titrations of the most potent derivative to gain insights about the binding mode and interactions of the compounds. ClogP values of the neutral and protonated structures of the compounds were calculated to determine their bioavailability.

The antiplasmodial activities of synthesized scaffolds depended on the nature of the substituent at the C4/C5 positions of the isoindoline-1,3-dione as well as on the length of the alkyl chain (n) introduced as a spacer. Analyzing the SAR among 4a-d (R = piperidyl, C4), an increase in chain length resulted in improvement in antiplasmodial activities, with compounds 4c (n = 4) and 4d (n = 6) with IC 50 s of 0.05 and 0.075 \u03bcM, respectively. Changing the position of piperidine from C4 to C5 nation of hydroxyethyl-piperazine at the C5 position and a propyl chain as a spacer, proved to be the most potent among the series, with an IC 50 of 0.006 \u03bcM (Figure 1 ).

The heme inhibition occurs via \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions of the quinoline ring with the porphyrin ring of FPIX. Considering the promising antiplasmodial activities of the synthesized series of compounds, we carried out heme-binding studies of the most active scaffold to decipher its mechanism of action [32] . In order to rationalize the binding mode, the interaction of 4r with hemin chloride was studied via spectrophotometric titrations at pH 7.4 (physiological pH) and 5.6 (approximate pH in the food vacuole of the parasite). Small increments of 4r (0-18 mM, 40% DMSO) were added stepwise into a constant concentration of monomeric heme (12 \u03bcM) at physiological pH (0.02 M HEPES buffer in aqueous DMSO at pH 7.4) and acidic pH (0.02M MES buffer in aqueous DMSO at pH 5.6), resulting in a substantial decrease in intensity of the Fe(III) PPIX Soret band at 401 nm, with no shift in the absorption maximum (Figures 3 & 4) . Solvent (DMSO) had no effect on the binding of 4r with heme at either pH used in this experiment (Supplementary Figure 8) . The binding constants (Table 2) were calculated by analyzing the titration curves using HypSpec, a nonlinear least-squares fitting program. Titrations of CQ with heme were performed under identical conditions, and binding constants were calculated for comparison purposes (Supplementary Figure  6-7) . The binding constants for the complexes formed between monomeric heme and 4r were comparable with those of the standard antimalarial drug CQ at physiological and acidic pH ( Table 2) . 1 H NMR titrations were further carried out to confirm the binding of 4r with monomeric heme. The titration experiment was performed by recording the 1 H NMR spectrum of 4r in 40% DMSO-d 6 formula C 60 H 60 ClFeN 9 O 7 , corroborating the formation of a 1:1 complex.",

Among the synthesized compounds, 4r with an optimum combination of a propylchain as a linker and hydroxyethyl piperazine as the cycloalkyl amine was the most active with IC 50 0.006 \u03bcM and a selectivity index >4200. The primary mode of action of these compounds appears to be binding with heme, as evident from heme-binding studies, further corroborated with NMR and high-resolution mass spectrum of the complex. The interaction energy of the diprotonated form of 4r(p) with heme models along with its favorable logP value could be the reason for its observed activity in comparison with that of CQ.",
