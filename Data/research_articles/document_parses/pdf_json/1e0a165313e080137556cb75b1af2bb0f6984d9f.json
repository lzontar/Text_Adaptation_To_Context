Although chronic underlying conditions are major determinants of severe respiratory virus infections, few data about coronavirus-related pneumonia in immunocompromised patients are available. Here we report 2 well-documented cases of pneumonia related to coronavirus 229E, each with a different clinical presentation. Diagnosis was made on the basis of viral culture and electron microscopy findings that exhibited typical crown-like particles and through amplification of the viral genome by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. On the basis of this report, coronaviruses should be considered as potential causative microorganisms of pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.",

In addition, an entity named \"idiopathic pneumonia syndrome,\" defined as diffuse lung injury for which the etiology is not identified, is frequently recognized after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Sputum samples were negative for Legionella species when subjected to direct immunofluorescence, and bacterial culture of the sputum samples showed no growth. Results of tests of serum samples for Aspergillus galactomannan antigen were also negative. Following failure of empirical antibiotic treatment (piperacillin and ciprofloxacin), fiber-optic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in the middle lobe.

In the case of the first patient, the main differential diagnosis was VZV-associated pneumonia, which is the most frequent complication of varicella in adults and is usually concomitant to cutaneous vesicles.

These methods include identification of corona-like particles, immunofluorescent assays with monoclonal antibodies, and RNA hybridization in fluid specimens from nasal washing or BAL [13] [14] [15] . Detection of seroconversion, based on ELISA findings, may be useful, but it does not allow rapid virus-identification and only provides a retrospective diagnosis [16] . We identified coronavirus in both patients because the BAL specimens were cultured in the human hepatoma HUH7 cell line, which expresses a specific receptor for coronaviruses [17] . Recent advances in virological detection methods, such as molecular amplification techniques, offer promising perspectives for detection of coronaviruses [18] . Indeed, improved sensitivity and specificity have been obtained with molecular detection methods combining RT-PCR with strain-specific primers derived from the M protein gene, followed by molecular hybridization with specific probes recognizing either coronavirus 229E or OC43 [9] . Inversely, the high sensitivity of amplification methods may lead to false-positive results caused by contamination of BAL fluid specimens with pharyngeal viruses. Therefore, the combination of viral culture and RT-PCR of BAL fluid samples appears to be an efficient and reliable diagnostic strategy.",

            "text": "Two coronavirus strains, 229E and OC43, have previously been related to human diseases with various clinical syndromes, ranging from self-resolving common cold to pneumonia [2] [3] [4] [5] . Recently, the worldwide outbreak of SARS was linked to a novel coronavirus that had not been previously identified in human beings or animals [6] . The clinical features of SARS combine flu-like symptoms, dry cough, and shortness of breath, associated with pulmonary infiltrates visible by chest radiography. In contrast to the common benign symptoms of coronavirus infections in healthy individuals, a large proportion of patients with SARS have severe respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support in the ICU. The impact of a respiratory virus on individuals is largely determined by their underlying conditions, and particularly by whether they are experiencing immunosuppression [19, 20] . The prevalence of coronavirus pulmonary infections among immunocompromised patients is unknown, and it is probably largely underestimated in the absence of the routine performance of sensitive cell culture, RT-PCR, or electron microscopy on BAL fluid specimens. However, RT-PCR results were negative for coronaviruses in the BAL samples of 46 HSCT recipients with acute pulmonary infiltrates [21] . Thus, only 1 case of coronavirus-associated pneumonia was previously described in an immunocompromised patient following autologous bone marrow transplantation, with the diagnosis based on the presence of viral particles in BAL fluid specimens [22] . The identification of coronavirus in high-risk immunocompromised patients may lead to early adoption of a specific therapeutic strategy, but, in the absence of proof of the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the treatment remains only symptomatic. In these circumstances, different types of IFNs that display antiviral properties against coronaviruses may be evaluated [23, 24] .",
