The prognosis of untreated GPA is poor, and a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (CYC) to induce remission, followed by maintenance therapy including low-dose corticosteroids and azathioprine (AZA), is recommended [2, 3] . Among these, AZA is a purine analog that is widely used to prevent transplant rejection and treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, and inflammatory bowel disease [4] . However, it has various side effects such as bone marrow suppression, infection, gastrointestinal intolerance, hepatitis, and, rarely, hypersensitivity reactions such as fever, arthralgia, skin rash, and pulmonary toxicity [5] . Pulmonary toxicity associated with AZA administration is usually reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or organ transplantation [6, 7] , and, to date, there is no report of its occurrence in a patient with GPA.

Peripheral blood tests and serum biochemistry at that time revealed the following: hemoglobin (Hb), 11.0 g/dl; white blood cell (WBC) count, 13,000/\u03bcl (neutrophils, 74.5 %); platelets, 306,000/ \u03bcl; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 45 mg/dl; and serum creatinine (Cr), 4.1 mg/dl. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria 2+, and the urinary sediment was found to contain several red blood cells (RBCs; dysmorphic 80 %) and five to 10 WBCs per high-power field (HPF). The 24-h urine volume was 550 ml, urinary protein excretion level was 217 mg per day, and Cr clearance was 22.8 ml/min/1.73 m 2 body surface area (BSA). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation was 17.44 ml/min/1.73 m 2 [8] . Serum immunoglobulin levels, complement levels, and the findings of blood coagulation tests were within normal limits. The results of serological tests, including those for antistreptolysin O, rheumatoid factor, venereal disease research laboratories (VDRL), hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody, antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, human immunodeficiency virus antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, and cryoglobulin, were all negative. However, an indirect immunofluorescence (IF) test showed positivity for cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, with a titer of 1:80, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed an anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level of 40 IU/ml (reference range, <2 IU/ml) and an anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA level of 0.8 IU/ml (reference range, <3.5 IU/ml). The patient did not report any specific family history or past history of systemic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or renal disease. Light microscopic examination of the kidney biopsy specimen revealed segmental or global sclerosis in 14 of 23 glomeruli and fibrocellular crescents in five glomeruli (Fig. 1) . IF microscopy did not show any immunoglobulin or complement deposition. On the basis of the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with GPA-associated pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg (7 mg/kg) for three consecutive days, followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg (1 mg/kg) daily. A single intravenous CYC dose of 900 mg [500 mg/BSA (m 2 )] was also administered every 4 weeks a total of six times; subsequently, AZA 100 mg (1.5 mg/kg/day) was orally administered daily for 5 months.

GPA is an ANCA-associated autoimmune disease that involves smalland medium-sized vessels and induces necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis [3] . When left untreated, the associated mortality rate is high. Therefore, severe cases should be treated with immunosuppressive regimens including a combination of high-dose corticosteroids and CYC to induce remission [3] . With regard to intravenous CYC therapy in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, CYC is administered at an initial dose of 750 mg/m 2 every 3-4 weeks [2] . For elderly patients aged >60 years, or those with severe renal dysfunction (GFR < 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ), the initial dose of CYC is reduced to 500 mg/m 2 [2] . Subsequent doses should be adjusted according to the patient's response to therapy and the degree of leukopenia [2] . CYC may be administered at a reduced dose of 500 mg/m 2 at monthly intervals when the Cr clearance is <30 ml/min [9] . Many previous studies on intravenous CYC pulse therapy also reported monthly administration of CYC [10] . After remission, the corticosteroid dose is gradually tapered, and CYC is replaced with AZA or methotrexate, which have comparably lower toxicities [1, 2] . AZA is converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and nitromethylimidazole in the liver after absorption into the body, and is finally metabolized to 6-thioguanine nucleotide. AZA inserts itself into nucleic acids, resulting in nucleic acid malfunction, chromosomal breakage, and inhibition of protein synthesis and mitosis, and it is inactivated by xanthine oxidase and thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) [4, 11] . AZA administration can result in dose-dependent toxicity, including myelosuppression, infection, gastrointestinal dysfunction, infertility, and hepatotoxicity based on the total administered amount and serum TPMT activity [5] . In rare circumstances, the imidazole moiety acts as a hapten and causes hypersensitivity reactions or various forms of pulmonary toxicity, such as interstitial pneumonia, restrictive lung disease, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [12] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 240, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 458, "end": 461, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 617, "end": 620, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 781, "end": 784, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 899, "end": 902, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1021, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1127, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1284, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1690, "end": 1693, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1697, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1922, "end": 1925, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2157, "end": 2161, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To date, 17 cases of pulmonary toxicity in adult patients taking AZA have been reported; most of these occurred in kidney transplant patients or those with inflammatory bowel disease [6, 7, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .
