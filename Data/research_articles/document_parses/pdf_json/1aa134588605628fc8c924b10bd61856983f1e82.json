These patients place a strain on health care systems and health care professionals (HCPs). Presently, we aimed to systematically review the literature on HCPs' experiences working with patients with long-term chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Method: A systematic search of papers published between 2002 and July 2019 was conducted in the Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE databases to identify studies reporting qualitative interviews addressing HCPs' experiences working with adults with COPD, CKD or type 2 diabetes. An interdisciplinary research group were involved in all phases of the study. With the help of NVivo, extracts of each paper were coded, and codes were compared across papers and refined using translational analysis. Further codes were clustered in categories that in turn formed overarching themes. Results: Our comprehensive search identified 4170 citations. Of these, 20 papers met our inclusion criteria. Regarding HCPs' experiences working with patients with COPD, CKD, or type 2 diabetes, we developed 10 subcategories that formed three overarching main themes of work experiences: 1) individualizing one's professional approach within the clinical encounter; 2) managing one's emotions over time; 3) working to maintain professionalism. Overall these three themes suggest that HCPs' work is a complex balancing act depending on the interaction between patient and professional, reality and professional ideals, and contextual support and managing one's own emotions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Keywords: Health personnel, Work experiences, Noncommunicable disease (NCD), Clinical encounters, diabetes mellitus, type 2, Pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive (COPD), Chronic kidney disease (CKD), patient-centered care, occupational burden", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(Continued from previous page)"}, {"text": "With an increasing number of patients with chronic conditions worldwide, a growing number of health care professionals (HCPs) will encounter these patients daily.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "As patients live longer with chronic diseases, the relationship between HCPs and patients may last for years.

If these chronic conditions are diagnosed at an early stage and adequate self-management strategies are applied, the prognosis can be good. Self-management of chronic disease entails an active role for patients, who must make day-to-day decisions to manage symptoms, treatment, physical and psychosocial consequences of the disease, and lifestyle changes [4] . Thus, selfmanagement within long-lasting care is often individualized, goal-oriented, and facilitated in collaboration with HCPs [5] . Nevertheless, these patients will often depend on support from the health care system for the rest of their lives, and the likelihood that these patients will leave the health care service once they have entered is low.

This is certainly the case for those living with chronic diseases, as patients are now expected to take an active role in their disease management: e.g. to follow medical regimes and comply with recommendations concerning lifestyle changes and adjustments in their daily lives. This requires that patients have easy access to information that is relevant to their specific situation. However, it may also challenge the HCP's role, as it represents a shift from a paternalistic approach, in which the HCP is the expert, to an approach in which the patient is acknowledged as an expert on his/her own life, with the right to make informed decisions regarding his/ her self-management [6] .

This definition of patient-centred care highlights the importance of clinicians and patients working together to produce the best possible outcomes. Several researchers are proponents of this concept; however, the question has also been raised how HCPs best should handle situations where a patient makes decisions that worsen disease outcomes [8, 9] . Repeated clinical encounters in which expectations regarding the patient role as expert are not met can contribute to this conflict, and possibly increase the already high strain and expectations placed on HCPs. Furthermore, the new HCP and patient roles are not necessarily thoroughly addressed during professional training. Thus, presumably HCPs must continuously balance their professional expertise with regards to responsibility and decision-making: taking responsibility and making decisions for the patient, or letting the responsibility lie with the patient, who may make decisions that include unhealthy behaviors.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 258, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 605, "end": 608, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 609, "end": 611, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Political statements recommend patient-centered care to a growing population of patients, many with NCDs [10, 11] .

One qualitative study aiming to elicit providers' perspectives on caring for patients with chronic pain found that HCPs internalized feelings of failure, guilt and discontent.

However, the three diseases also have clear differences in their treatment, their need for HCP follow up and prognosis over time, making them suitable to contrast the HCP experience. Thereby, we sought new insights that could aid HCPs, policymakers, and educational institutions in reducing the strain on HCPs and preventing burn-out among HCPs.

The members of the research group had all worked in clinical and research settings with patients with a range of chronic diseases. Whereas most of the nurses had insider knowledge from their clinical work and research on diabetes, COPD, or CKD, the physiotherapists had an outsider perspective, as their experiences related mainly to chronic musculoskeletal disorders. These differences nurtured our discussions during the whole process. In order to enhance the researcher's reflexivity, shifting pairs of researchers worked together in all phases of the review process of inclusion/exclusion, appraising the methodological quality, extracting the data for further analysis, and analyzing the data.

The HCPs felt that they had to engage emotionally with their patients, and they largely regarded this as positive. However, a long-term patient-provider relationship could also lead to negative personal relationships with patients [24] . If the relationship was poor, it could become challenging for HCPs to provide individualized care. Nurses working with hemodialysis handled this by maintaining a professional and emotional distance from their patients, for example, by simply accepting the patients' demands; others felt pride when they successfully managed the more difficult relationships [28] . In some cases, HCPs decided to transfer the responsibility for the treatment of a patient to a colleague [23] . In others, HCPs stayed in the struggle, and ultimately developed a better understanding of why the patients appeared to be so difficult [35] . Accordingly, clinical encounters could cause stress, frustration, and tension among the HCPs. However, there were also positive aspects of having personal relationships with patients. One example from a renal ward highlights how doctors valued their long-term, friendly relationships with patients throughout the process of renal failure and dialysis, in which they could share their patients' joy when conditions improved: for example, when a kidney transplantation was successful [30] . However, patients could also die, and if the HCPs had established a positive relationship with their patients, they mourned their loss.
