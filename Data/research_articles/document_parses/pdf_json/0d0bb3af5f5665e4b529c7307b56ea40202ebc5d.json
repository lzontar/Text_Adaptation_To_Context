The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2 (2, 3) , which first emerged in Wuhan, China on December 12 th 2019 (4, 5) . Worldwide dissemination has been extremely rapid, and by the time this study was completed a total of 416,916 cases and 18,565 deaths had been reported across 123 countries according to data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (6) . Although 86% of all cases are estimated to have been undocumented prior to the cordon sanitaire in China (7), partial COVID-19 prevalence data is still an invaluable resource to help monitoring and controlling the disease. In particular, extracting daily estimates of growth rate (cases/day) and acceleration (cases/day\u00b2) in disease dissemination from real-time case reports can be decisive for an effective and promptly action to restrain further contagion. Here we report the application of a simple statistical framework, namely moving regression (MR), to the analysis of publicly available COVID-19 case reports that are updated daily by the ECDC.",

            "text": "We start from the reasonable assumption that the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases over time (i.e., the growth curve) in a specific country or territory should typically follow an unknown sigmoidal function (Fig. 1a) . In fact, empirical data from China (Fig. 1b) and South Korea (Fig. 1c) strongly support that assumption. We note however that this assumption is substantially relaxed later by our model to accommodate complex dynamics in the evolution of COVID-19 prevalence. We define growth rate and growth acceleration as the first and second order derivatives of the prevalence of COVID-19 in respect to time. In our analysis, we selected MR over competing models that are frequently used to describe the behavior of growth curves, such as the Gompertz (8) model, because: (i) it is dependent on a single free parameter, the \"smooth factor\", which represents the number of neighboring days used in local regression; (ii) growth rate and acceleration estimates are approximated by ordinary least squares equations, which are computationally inexpensive; (iii) we performed extensive simulations of growth curves and found that it produces reasonably accurate estimates of growth rate (median R 2 = 0.99 with smooth factor of 3) and acceleration (median R 2 = 0.92 with smooth factor of 3) (Supplementary Fig. 1) ; (iv) it is very robust to departures from sigmoidal curves; and (v) it does not rely on observations of the whole curve and thus can produce estimates in almost real time. Argument (v) is especially relevant to the analysis of COVID-19 data since the pandemic is ongoing and each country will be at a different stage of the growth curve as time passes. A clear disadvantage of MR is that it may over-fit the growth curve to the data, especially if the selected smooth factor is small (say < 3), in which case accurate prediction of new cases of COVID-19 is limited to very few days in the future. Still, even singleday predictions can be of great use during a pandemic if reasonably accurate. In the ECDC data set, a forward validation showed that single-day predictions were sufficiently accurate (R\u00b2 ~ 0.95) (Supplementary Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "Growth curves can be partitioned into four easily distinguishable stages (Fig. 1a) : (a) the lagging stage, which corresponds to the beginning of the outbreak or disease importation, where the number of cases are low and increase only marginally every day; (b) the exponential stage, when growth starts accelerating and the number of new cases increase rapidly day-by-day; (c) the deceleration stage, where the number of new cases reduces daily and tends to asymptote; and (d) the stationary stage, characterized by stagnation of the prevalence with sporadic new cases occurring each day. The growth rate is the first order derivative of the growth curve and it is approximately bell-shaped, with its peak corresponding to the inflection of the exponential stage. This inflection point signals the beginning of a decline in the growth rate. The growth acceleration is the second order derivative and consists of a combination of two bell-shaped curves: the first one with a peak and the second with a valley. The peak indicates the point where acceleration starts descending towards zero. The moment when acceleration is exactly zero coincides with the inflection of the exponential stage, which marks the beginning of growth deceleration (i.e., negative acceleration). The latter corresponds to the entire concave section of the curve, but the very bottom of the valley indicates that the prevalence is moving towards stagnation. Although sigmoidal curves follow these four stages sequentially, we anticipate that the growth of COVID-19 cases may not necessarily obey a sigmoidal curve in practice, since the dynamics of the disease are complex and highly dependent on public health measures. This implies that a country that has already reached a stationary stage could resume exponential growth, for example by seeding a new outbreak via importation. Likewise, decelerating countries could as well regain acceleration by relaxing prevention measures. These scenarios could produce more complex growth curves that combine multiple exponential, deceleration and stationary stages. Of note, MR has sufficient flexibility to model these complex scenarios and can easily accommodate curves exhibiting anomalous combinations of these four stages. In this study we sought to ascertain whether these characteristics of growth curves could have direct implications in understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence both globally and locally.",

The observation that the majority of the countries were in exponential growth implies that the pandemics is expanding. Only a handful of countries (i.e., those in deceleration or stagnation) were found to be experiencing an apparent control of COVID-19 dissemination. The countries found in stationary stage were China and South Korea (Fig. 1b-c) , whereas the ones in deceleration were Denmark, Estonia and Qatar (Fig. 2) . By projecting official government announcements against the fitted curves of these countries, we observed that decline in growth acceleration occurred shortly after (< 1 week) the implementation of measures that drastically reduced human movement. Deceleration of growth was typically achieved within 2 weeks in these five countries. For China and South Korea, COVID-19 prevalence plateaued within 6 weeks. These results showed that: (i) the effect of public health measures on SARS-CoV-2 prevention can be detected in seemingly real time by monitoring the behavior of the growth rate and acceleration curves; and (ii) restriction to human mobility is very effective in controlling the spread of the disease, but takes several weeks to produce a stationary growth. These findings are in line with a recent study showing that human mobility explained early growth and decline of new cases of COVID-19 in China (9) . As discussed before, one should not immediately assume that a country in deceleration or plateau will remain stationary, since acceleration could take off again.",

The latter has been severely impacted with the disease, and by the time we completed our study the country had recorded 69,176 cases and 6,820 deaths. On March 10 th 2020 Italy implemented a strict quarantine, and five days later the country reached its maximum acceleration and started to move towards an inflection of the exponential growth. Our results indicate that, if Italy persists in this path, deceleration could begin within a few weeks in the country. In fact, on March 25 th Italy implemented a complete shut down of its borders, which may help the country to reach deceleration sooner. In contrast, Brazil and USA continued a march of exponential growth with no clear sign of reaching an inflection point soon. Still, since acceleration response to effective measures seems rapid, both Brazil and USA could bend their acceleration curves within days if such measures are implemented.",

One day after, the country registered a sudden spike in the number of cases (arrow). The days that followed were marked by a clear decline in acceleration and eventually deceleration of growth, which coincided with a succession of measures by the Qatari government that eventually led to significant restrictions to human movement.

Likewise, the last s days had their growth rates estimated by compounding rates from n -s to n using the acceleration estimated for day n -s. Finally, next-day predictions of COVID-19 prevalence were obtained by summing the last observed prevalence with its estimated growth rate. In order to measure the accuracy of these predictions, we performed a step-wise simulation by censoring observations ahead of each day, fitting MR to the remaining data and then comparing predicted and true next-day prevalence.
