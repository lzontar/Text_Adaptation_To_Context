Possible cause may be the poor quality of the detecting antigens used. Three different types of antigens were reported to be used: 1) the recombinant N protein from SARS-CoV-2, which is highly conserved among all 7 members of coronaviruses and led to poor specificity in tests of general population, 2) CHO-expressed S1 protein from SARS-CoV, which has very different antigenicity from its counterpart in SARS-CoV-2, or 3) the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S1, which is about 200 amino acids long with only one glycosylation, compared to the full length S1 which has 7 glycosylation sites.

Misdiagnose of nonlethal coronavirus such as HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 infections as SARS-CoV-2 could send thousands and thousands of people to already overloaded hospitals and increase the risk of real infection by SARS-CoV-2 during the unnecessary hospital visit.
