            "text": "The importance of an accurate and rapid diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis cannot be overstated. Such infections cannot, at the moment, be prevented by vaccination or attenuated by chemotherapy; however, if the diagnosis is accurate and the patient well managed, they are rarely life-threatening. Management consists of replacing lost water and electrolytes either by mouth or intravenously for the duration of the diarrhoea and vomiting. The disease is usually self-limiting, rarely lasting more than a few days. In contrast, diarrhoea caused by bacteria and parasites such as Vibrio cholera, campylobacters, giardiae and amoebae often require treatment with an appropriate chemotherapeutic agent as well as fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy.",

However, none of these strategies has been of much value in the diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis. This is because all viruses so far implicated in gastroenteritis have shown an almost exclusive tropism for the highly differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine. Diagnosis by examination of biopsy tissue is unnecessarily invasive, and although some viruses have been grown in cultured cells even this remains a difficult and unreliable method of diagnosis. Moreover it is likely to remain so until a cell line is developed that mimics more closely the morphology and biochemistry of the mature enterocyte. Serology is also of little use in rapid diagnosis because a specific antibody response occurs too late in most cases; however, retrospective epidemiological investigations can benefit from the method. This has given rise to an ironic situation whereby we have become dependent upon the traditional and time-honoured art of electron microscopy and file technical innovations of immunology and molecular biology. Furthermore, it can be argued that as a result of the study of gastroenteritis (and the equally fastidious hepatitis) viruses, many of the now familiar \"third generation\" tests have been adopted for both gastroenteritis and non-gastroenteritis viruses.",

Indeed all of the known viruses implicated in diarrhoea were initially discovered in this way. For some agents such as astrovirus, calicivims and other small round viruses there is no other method that is widely available ( Table 1) . Although reliable, electron microscopy is not without its disadvantages. An electron microscope is an expensive piece of equipment. Given that the major impact of viral diarrhoea is in the developing countries this point should not be trivialised.",

Its role is already well established in the detection of rotaviruses where it has proved invaluable in both developed and developing countries because of its sensitivity, specificity, safety and low price. The application of ELISA to the diagnosis of other gastroenteritis viruses has been hampered by the lack of specific antisera. These have proven difficult to produce, again because of the reluctance of these viruses to grow in cell culture, and (unlike rotaviruses) they are not present in stool samples in sufficient numbers for this to be used as a source of antigen.",

            "text": "Most existing ELISA procedures can be further refined. Enzyme/antibody conjugation methods, for example, often reduce the avidity of the antibody for the antigen and also the activity of the enzyme (1). Also many commercially available conjugates contain isoenzymes of lower activity which lower the titre and the sensitivity of the reagents. It has been estimated that irradiated polystyrene and polyvinylchloride solid phases bind less than 10 % of the protein (antigen or antibody) made available to them. Use of other materials such as nitrocellulose, which is known to have a far greater binding capacity, should significantly improve the sensitivity of the test system. The sensitivity of both direct and indirect assays has been increased by using avidinenzyme conjugates and biotinylated antisera (1). Recently a method for amplifying the sensitivity of ELISA tests that utilize alkaline phosphatase has been described (2) . This method is based on the dephosphorylation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) by conjugated alkaline phosphatase. The NAD is then reduced and reoxidized in a cyclic enzyme-mediated reaction (Figure 1 ). This cyclic substrate system is 10-100 times more sensitive than conventional substrates of alkaline phosphatase, This method has been used to detect low levels of rotavirus serotype-specific antigens directly in stool samples and may prove to be of value in the development of assays for viruses present in faeces in only low numbers (3).",

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)has been used successfully to diagnose rotavirus infections by demonstration of the characteristic profile of 11 RNA genome segjnents in silver-stained slab gels (4) . Adenoviruses have also been detected in a similar way by using restriction endonucleases to segment their genomic DNA in vitro (5) . Such methods do have advantages over serological ones. They often detect differences between strains which cannot be separated serologically (6) . Such differences have proven useful in epidemiological studies. Furthermore serologically unique viruses can also be detected. Such strains are negative by ELISA. To date four previously unknown groups of rotaviruses have been discovered by PAGE of viral genomic RNA in faeces (7). There is no reason why other gastroenteritis viruses could not be diagnosed by this method, providing the appropriate restriction enzymes are used.",
