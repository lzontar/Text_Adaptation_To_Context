Kind regards Dear Sir, UK Government guidelines for protection of those who are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 pandemic advise certain groups to stringently follow social distancing measures. Inevitably some health care workers fall into these categories and working in a hospital places them at high risk of exposure to the virus.",

In light of COVID-19 our hospital, a regional trauma centre for Burns, Plastic Surgery and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, was reorganized to increase capacity for both trauma and cancer work. As part of this a virtual hand trauma service has been set up. The primary aim of the new virtual hand trauma clinic was to allow patients to be triaged in a timely manner while adhering to social distancing guidelines by remotely accessing the clinic from home. Further aims were to reduce time spent in hospital and reduced time between referral and treatment.",

Patients benefit from having access to a group of knowledgeable trainees, supported by consultants, and a service accessible from their own home. This minimizes footfall within our hospital, exposure to, and spread of COVID-19.

While direct observation of procedural skills and procedure based assessment are not feasible, case based discussions and clinical evaluation exercises have been easily achievable due to trainees managing patients with involvement of supervising senior colleagues in decision making. This plus a varied case mix seen has enhanced development of knowledge, decision making, leadership and communication skills. As trainees are unable to attend theatre practical skills may suffer depending on how long clinicians are non patient facing. This has been acknowledged by the GMC in the skill fade review; skills have been shown to decline over 6 -18 months 5 . Although it can only be postulated at the current time colleagues who are patient facing but redeployed may face a similar skill decline.",
