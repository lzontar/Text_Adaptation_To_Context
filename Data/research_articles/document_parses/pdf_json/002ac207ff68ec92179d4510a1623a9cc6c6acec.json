Because of differences in ARI symptom criteria, our focus on wintertime incidence only, and differences in study designs, findings from our study cannot be directly compared with many of these classic studies. However, we estimated that one-third of adults and nearly four-fifths of children in our two communities developed 51 ARI during the 3-month respiratory period. A recent household cohort study from Michigan [38] found that the mean number of ARIs per individual over a 6-month period that coincided with our 3-month period was 1\u00b71 for children aged <5 years and 0\u00b76 for adults aged 18-49 yearsthese results are similar to ours, despite the differences in study design.

Further, despite suboptimal influenza vaccination rates, influenza vaccination may have lowered the relative disease burden from this virus, although the tremendous variability in the timing, intensity, and duration of influenza circulation from year-to-year makes such assessments difficult. Vaccination rates were 59% and 41% in the Rochester and Marshfield study populations, respectively, and it was estimated that vaccine effectiveness in preventing medically attended influenza visits in a four-community study that included both Rochester and Marshfield was 60% during the same influenza season as assessed in our study [31] .

Thus, efforts to develop vaccines to reduce ARIs have the potential for substantial benefit in reducing the disease burden from community-based ARIs as well as reducing medically attended healthcare visits.

However, we caution against over-interpretation of our findings due to several important limitations. First, we studied only two communities, during a single respiratory season over a 3-month period which missed the peak season for PIV and RV. Geographical and seasonal variability in the viral aetiologies of ARI are substantial [2, 7, 10] , for example, it is difficult to draw inferences about ARI incidence or virus burden from a single season of surveillance. Also, the relative contribution of some viruses might be different had we included a longer study period. Second, while our strict definition of ARIs (current illness with feverishness or cough) likely excluded other causes of stuffiness such as allergies, we may have missed some ARIs. Third, we interviewed only two-thirds of persons contacted, and obtained nasal/throat specimens for only two-thirds of ARI cases. We are aware of some selection bias in subjects agreeing to be interviewed. For example, Rochester subjects who agreed were more likely than the original sampling frame to be male and adult. While others have noted lower ARI reports in men [41] , our ARI findings do not vary by gender; also we stratify findings by age group. It is possible that subjects from whom specimens were collected differed by viral aetiology or other characteristics. Fourth, despite making >38 000 telephone calls, we were able to collect only 208 nasal/throat swabs from subject with ARIs. Our sample sizes for individual viruses are small. Fifth, we may have missed some subjects who would have tested positive for a viral respiratory pathogen because we performed nasal swabs and used TAC detection methods rather than nasopharyngeal swabs and more sensitive conventional PCR assays. Sixth, we selected subjects with symptoms for 47 days, but it is possible that some were no longer shedding virus, especially if they underestimated their days of symptoms prior to being contacted. Finally, we simply summed estimated weekly ARI incidence to derive a cumulative incidence, using a RCS design.

In individuals with ARIs, four-fifths did not make a visit to a healthcare provider because of their symptoms. ARIs due to both influenza and other viruses cause substantial morbidity undetected by the healthcare delivery system. In an era when actively following large cohorts of consenting subjects for disease surveillance purposes is expensive and resource intensive, the use of RCS designs similar to ours may offer a reasonable alternative strategy for conducting surveillance for more common illnesses.

Second, despite use of advanced molecular techniques, we were able to identify viruses from only 39% of individuals with ARI symptoms. Third, influenza viruses accounted for only 11% of virus-positive cases, or 4% of all ARI cases. Fourth, the distribution of viruses was similar for children vs. adults. Finally, only one-fifth of ARI cases (and 2/9 influenza cases) had a healthcare visit for the ARI.Several groundbreaking longitudinal cohort studies of respiratory illnesses were conducted from 1948 to 1976: the Cleveland Family Study, the Houston Family Study, the New York Virus Watch, the Tecumseh Study, and the Seattle Virus Watch", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Viruses associated with acute respiratory illnesses", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Distribution of viruses for children versus adults", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Rochester (n= 97)*\n</td><td>Marshfield (n= 110)*\n</td><td>Total (N= 207)*\n</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza </td><td>5 (5%) </td><td>4 (4%) </td><td>9 (4%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza A </td><td>4 </td><td>4 </td><td>8\n</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza B </td><td>1 </td><td>0 </td><td>1\n</td></tr><tr><td>Respiratory syncytial\n</td><td>7 (7%) </td><td>7 (6%) </td><td>14 (7%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>virus\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Parainfluenza (PIV) </td><td>1 (1%) </td><td>3 (3%) </td><td>4 (2%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>PIV-1 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\n</td></tr><tr><td>PIV-2 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\n</td></tr><tr><td>PIV-3 </td><td>1 </td><td>3 </td><td>4\n</td></tr><tr><td>PIV-4 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\n</td></tr><tr><td>Rhinovirus </td><td>17 (18%) </td><td>8 (7%) </td><td>25 (12%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Human coronavirus\n</td><td>8 (8%) </td><td>20 (18%) </td><td>28 (14%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>(HCV)\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>HCV-1 (229E) </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>0\n</td></tr><tr><td>HCV-2 (NL63) </td><td>2 </td><td>9 </td><td>11\n</td></tr><tr><td>HCV-3 (OC43) </td><td>5 </td><td>6 </td><td>11\n</td></tr><tr><td>HCV-4 (HKU1) </td><td>1 </td><td>5 </td><td>6\n</td></tr><tr><td>Adenovirus </td><td>1 (1%) </td><td>1 (1%) </td><td>2 (1%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Human\n</td><td>5 (5%) </td><td>4 (4%) </td><td>9 (4%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>metapneumovirus\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>At least 1 virus identified\n</td><td>38 (39%) </td><td>43 (39%) </td><td>81 (39%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>1 virus identified </td><td>33 (34%) </td><td>39 (35%) </td><td>72 (35%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>52 viruses identified </td><td>5 (5%) </td><td>4 (4%) </td><td>9 (4%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>No viruses identified </td><td>59 (61%) </td><td>67 (61%) </td><td>126 (61%)\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Healthcare utilization in subjects with ARIs", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Rochester (n= 90)\n</td><td>Marshfield (n= 110)\n</td><td>Total (N = 200)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Did not have any healthcare visits\n</td><td>71 (79%) </td><td>90 (82%) </td><td>161 (81%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Had a healthcare visit for the ARI*\n</td><td>19 (21%) </td><td>20 (18%) </td><td>39 (20%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Primary care office </td><td>14 (78%) </td><td>16 (80%) </td><td>30 (79%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>ED or urgent care </td><td>4 (22%) </td><td>1 (5%) </td><td>5 (13%)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Hospitalization </td><td>0 </td><td>3 (15%) </td><td>3 (8%)\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "This study was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through cooperative agreements with the University of Rochester (U01 IP000172) and Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation (U01 IP000183).
