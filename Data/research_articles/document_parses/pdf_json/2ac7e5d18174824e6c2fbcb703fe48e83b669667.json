[6] [7] [8] Findings from a component analysis found training of respirator users improved knowledge, but there were common challenges in performance related to seal checking and avoiding facemask contact with removal. 6 When comparing training methods, video training that included illustrations, text, and demonstration was found to be a superior training method to printed materials or computer-based training with additional review questions, both of which were self-paced. 7 The work included an evaluation of the persistence of respirator donning and doffing techniques at 6 months, and performance scores became significantly worse. 8 Educational research additionally supports video review as an effective tool for learners with various levels of experience, but it emphasizes the importance of evaluation metrics or specific benchmarks. [9] [10] Behavior related to respirator use may be improved by structuring observations through specific objective measures instead of simply reviewing video of performance. 9 Effectiveness of video feedback is enhanced when a standard evaluation form is provided to the trainee to focus their concentration on specific targeted behaviors. 10 A systematic review in 2019 found that simulation studies regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) use need to focus on increasing the number of study participants and determining best training methods. 11 Recent studies have found poor doffing behaviors in isolation care using trained observers in the clinical environment. 12 Simulation has become a feasible means to evaluate PPE infection control behaviors in HCWs.
