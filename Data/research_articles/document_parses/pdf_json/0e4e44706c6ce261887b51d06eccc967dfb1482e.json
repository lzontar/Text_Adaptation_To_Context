Detecting pathogens in trade is critical for preventing their continued movement and introduction, but screening a sufficient fraction to ensure rare infections are detected is simply infeasible for many taxa and settings because of the vast numbers of animals involved-hundreds of millions of live animals are imported into the U.S.A. alone every year. Batch processing pools of individual samples or using environmental DnA (eDnA)-the genetic material shed into an organism's environment-collected from whole consignments of animals may substantially reduce the time and cost associated with pathogen surveillance. Both approaches, however, lack a framework with which to determine sampling requirements and interpret results. Here I present formulae for pooled individual samples (e.g,. swabs) and eDNA samples collected from finite populations and discuss key assumptions and considerations for their use with a focus on detecting Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, an emerging pathogen that threatens global salamander diversity. While empirical validation is key, these formulae illustrate the potential for eDnA-based detection in particular to reduce sample sizes and help bring clean trade into reach for a greater number of taxa, places, and contexts.",

The pathways of trade are diverse and complex 6,10 so only portions are well characterized, but two estimates are illustrative and sobering. First, over a billion ornamental fish are traded internationally every year 14 . Second, the USA alone imports an average of 225 million individuals in addition to 1.8 \u00d7 10 6 kg of live animals per year, the \"vast majority\" of which are part of the aquatics and pet industry 6 . While there are national or international regulations governing the trade of certain taxa (e.g., those of economic importance, threats to human health, threatened and endangered species), for most there is little on-the-ground scrutiny and little or no surveillance for disease. (Australia, with its strong focus on biosecurity, is an admirable exception 20 .) Indeed, detecting infections with standard, individual-based sampling-that is, collecting a swab, tissue, or blood sample from each individual for subsequent diagnostic tests-requires such large sample sizes as to frequently make routine surveillance uneconomical, politically unpalatable, or simply infeasible. Even under a best-case scenario (e.g., using a diagnostically perfect test to detect a pathogen occurring at 10% prevalence) one would still need to screen 25 individuals in a consignment of 100 animals; multiplied by the myriad consignments (e.g., >10 5 per year into the USA alone 6 ) and the number becomes daunting. More often we are interested in detecting rare infections with imperfect diagnostic tests (i.e., false negatives and false positives occur at some non-trivial rate) and the sample sizes increase concomitantly.",

The eDNA approach seems especially relevant to aquatic and semi-aquatic taxa, which make up a large portion of the wildlife trade 6 , as eDNA can be simply filtered from water housing animals; they need not even be handled. (Semi-aquatic species or life stages are often shipped in moist sphagnum moss or paper, but can then be placed in water to collect eDNA during a quarantine period 26 .) Environmental DNA sampling is being used to detect pathogens in a growing number of settings, from natural environments [27] [28] [29] [30] to ballast water 31 and even in trade [32] [33] [34] . However, while the statistical framework for making proper inference from eDNA results is well-developed in certain contexts (e.g., the presence or absence of a target species in ponds using occupancy models 29, 35 ), these approaches do not translate well to sampling small captive populations or consignments.",

While the number of consignments of amphibians into or between EU member nations is not available in the literature, an estimated 3-5 million live amphibians are imported per year into the USA, alone 39, 71 and 130,000 annually into the U.K. 72 . Since Bsal is thought to occur at low prevalence in traded animals 49 , the EU regulations require screening all or a substantial fraction of individuals in a consignment to ensure a reasonable chance of detection (Fig. 1) . While shipments of certain taxa or from certain sources might be excluded, even conservative assumptions about the volume of trade imply screening an enormous number of samples if this program were extended worldwide (e.g., 1000 consignments of 200 salamanders each would require testing some 98,000 swabs). This scale of sampling is likely to place clean trade beyond the reach of many nations or interested parties (e.g., constituents in the pet trade industry). Similar problems arise when considering other amphibian pathogens (e.g., Ranavirus 39 ) or those of fishes. The question in this paper is therefore: can pooling swab samples or using eDNA place routine surveillance in reach?",

In the case of Bsal detection, I would hope that any positive test would be investigated further with additional, independent diagnostic tests. Moreover, setting aside the issue of carry over contamination 34 , which might be avoided by transferring animals to clean water prior to sampling, there is no evidence that false positive rates are higher in pools of samples or eDNA than typical individual samples. In fact, to the extent that fewer tests are conducted with pooling or eDNA one would expect fewer false positives at a given level of surveillance sensitivity.

            "text": "A key assumption of this formula is that diagnostic sensitivity is not affected by pooling. This implies on the one hand that the combined analyte (e.g., target DNA) from multiple infected individuals does not increase diagnostic sensitivity. The probability of detecting a single infection in a pool of samples (i.e., swabs) is at most the diagnostic sensitivity of individual swabs. On the other hand, the formula assumes that the analyte is not overwhelmed or inhibited by non-target materials (e.g., PCR inhibitors in skin secretions, microbial DNA) nor diluted below a detection threshold (e.g., as was observed with pools of fish screened for a Megalocytivirus 75 ). This later assumption is unlikely to hold with very large pools of samples (see Laurin et al. 74 for a review), but may be reasonable for small pools. It is an important assumption to test under realistic conditions, but one could simply use lower values of diagnostic sensitivity (Se in Eq. (6)) to account for target swamping or dilution. Also, it is worth remembering that the same number of samples must be collected with or without pooling; efficiencies are only gained in the processing and screening steps. environmental DnA. I developed a new formula for eDNA-based detection in small, closed populations (Eq. (9)). The formula makes two key assumptions. First, it assumes that the eDNA shed into the water is homogeneously distributed in the water. While pathogen eDNA is likely clumped (e.g., Bsal may be found principally in skin sheds), one could homogenize the water (e.g., with a blender) prior to taking samples to meet this assumption, at least in the smaller volumes used to house animals in shipments or captive populations. Thus, replicate eDNA samples are essentially technical replicates in this framework. Second, as with the formula for pooled samples, it assumes that test sensitivity is unaffected by the number of hosts in the water at the same time. That is, the target pathogen eDNA is not swamped by non-target host and microbial eDNA or other waste material leading to inhibition of the PCR reaction. This assumption needs to be empirically verified, but it may be possible to minimize PCR inhibition with dedicated kits 29 or by diluting the eluted DNA prior to PCR, although such methods risk reducing sensitivity. In any case, the formula I present could be extended to account for this swamping effect if needed.",

            "text": "These assumptions have two important consequences for eDNA-based pathogen detection. First, every sample collects eDNA from the entire population. Environmental DNA avoids the issue of whether rare infections are included in any random sample of individuals-they are all sampled because the eDNA from all individuals is distributed homogeneously in the water. The question is only whether there is sufficient target eDNA in a sample to ensure a reasonable probability of a positive test. As a consequence, eDNA sampling can detect rare infections with many fewer samples than individual swabs, or pools of swabs, even when diagnostic sensitivity is very low (Figs. 1 and 2). (I consider various factors that are likely to affect sensitivity in the next section.) This also means that the probability of detecting an infection is, all else being equal, independent of population size (Fig. 2) . Thus, while individual-level swabbing can be more efficient than eDNA in small populations, in larger populations eDNA outperformed swabbing, even when pooled, over a wide range of parameter values (Fig. 2) . Similarly, samples sizes for eDNA-based detection decrease with population size when prevalence is held constant because there are more infected individuals shedding pathogen eDNA, whereas they must increase with population size when using individual or pooled sampling to ensure infected individuals are included in any sample (Fig. 1 ). Once again, it is essential to establish the actual performance of eDNA-based detection in real world contexts and test how it scales with population size and other variables. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Quantitative nature of detection. Diagnostic sensitivity is usually defined in the context of a classification problem with binary infection status determined by a gold standard of infection (e.g., histopathology) or assigned in experiments. As such, sensitivity is generally assumed to be fixed; that is, all infections within a population or experiment are equally detectable. However, any test that reacts directly with the pathogen (e.g., pathogen DNA or antigens) or host responses (e.g., antibodies) is necessarily dose-dependent ( Fig. 3 ; Eq. (11)). The variation in the amount of the analyte between infected individuals or among laboratories, protocols, etc., may be small enough to ignore (but see e.g., Rimmer et al. 76 ), or the concentrations generally large enough that detection is assured (e.g., with clearly diseased animals), in which case it may be reasonable to assume diagnostic sensitivity is constant. At the other extreme, recently infected individuals, sub-clinical carriers 16 , or otherwise inapparent infections tend to produce or shed little analyte and are thus much less easily detected than clinically infected animals. Quantitative real time PCR of swabs, for instance, often fails to detect low-level Bd infections 77 11)) of the per target copy detection rate, \u03c6 and the number of copies of the target DNA or analyte, C. The arrows and dotted vertical lines show the consequences of increasing the volume of water in which animals are held ten-fold, thus diluting the analyte (blue) or increasing the number of infected animals from one to two, three, or four. Note, however, that the concrete effect of such changes on the probability of a positive test depends on where one starts along the \u03c6C axis.",

Thus, one would expect a great deal more variability in sensitivity of eDNA between settings and studies, not to mention between taxa, than with traditional sampling directly from animals. Empirical validation of eDNA-based pathogen detection should thus focus on understanding the causes and consequences of this variability across consignment types, holding conditions, and sampling approaches, and work to develop standards. Equations (11)- (14) are an initial attempt to explore these influences (Fig. 3) . They emphasize that equivalent changes in the number of infected animals, their shedding rates, the proportion of the environment sampled, or rates of degradation all have equivalent effects on the amount of analyte in a sample, and thus detection probability. It is worth noting, however, that researchers may have control over certain key variables, such as the duration and volume in which animals are held before collecting samples, allowing them to maximize sensitivity. For instance, if rates of eDNA shedding and degradation are fairly constant and fast relative to changes in the underlying infection intensity, one would expect eDNA concentrations in water to approach an equilibrium over time, at least as a first approximation (Eq. (13)). The rate at which it asymptotes depends on the rate of degradation, and so water quality, temperature, pH, etc. are likely to be important 78, 79 . However, unless rates of degradation are exceedingly rapid, one would expect concentrations of eDNA to accumulate over several days and so investigators might increase sensitivity by holding animals longer prior to sampling.",

            "text": "In the case of Bsal, Sabino-Pinto et al. 23 found that diagnostic sensitivity of the typical qPCR assay 69 was unaffected when DNA was extracted from pools of up to four skin swabs. While the authors specifically recommend against pooling in trade and quarantine settings given the risks associated with the failure to detect a single infected individual 23 , their results suggest pooling could reduce several-fold the number of DNA extractions and qPCR reactions required to achieve the EU's requisite detection probability in a shipment ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Again, empirical tests in real-world settings, especially with low-level Bsal infections, are needed to evaluate the actual sensitivity when pooling samples. Hyatt et al. 80 , for instance, found that diagnostic sensitivity of their qPCR assay for Bd remained high in pools of five swabs, so long as \"equivocal\" results (one or two of three wells positive) were scored as positive-likely because of a dilution of target DNA-but even here, one low-level infection went undetected in a pool. Still, losses in sensitivity may be offset by increases in the fraction of a population or consignment that can be screened when samples are pooled, essentially increasing the chances that a rare infected individual is included in a sample. For instance, even if sensitivity is reduced from a probability of one with individual swabs to 0.75 with a pool of four swabs, many fewer assays need be run on the pools than the individual swabs to attain the same confidence of detecting an infection (Fig. 2) . Equation (7) and the included R code can be used to evaluate this trade-off.",

The samples collect genetic material shed into the water (or environment more broadly), so whatever material is shed, which may be minimal, is diluted in a larger volume and might be degraded. All of which means that fairly little target DNA may end up in any given eDNA sample. Thus, one would expect the diagnostic sensitivity of eDNA samples to be quite low relative to individual-based samples 26, 73 (Fig. 3) . However, eDNA samples from the entire population, at least in the context of small captive populations or consignments of animals in water, perhaps with the aid of mechanical homogenization. This allows eDNA to circumvent the problem of including rare infected individuals in sample that is intrinsic to individual-level sampling (and pooling). As a result, even with low sensitivity, eDNA sampling can be much more efficient at detecting infections in large consignments than perfectly sensitive individual-based samples or pools of samples. Moreover, sample sizes required to detect a rare infection do not increase with population or consignment size (Fig. 2) . Sampling eDNA thus offers the promise of dramatically reducing the amount of sampling required to ensure disease freedom in the trade of live aquatic and semi-aquatic animals.",

It is important to evaluate these factors empirically so that the results can be properly interpreted. The simple model presented in Eqs.

The proportion of holding water sampled and time animals spend in the water, shedding pathogen eDNA, are likely key parameters, but may vary substantially among taxa, life stages, and settings.

They suggest that pooling individual-level samples and, especially, collecting eDNA can substantially reduce sample sizes required to ensure rare, but important infections are found. Moreover, sampling at key nodes in the distribution networks or crucial segments of the live animal trade (e.g., particular species, sources) can make surveillance even more tractable 10 .
