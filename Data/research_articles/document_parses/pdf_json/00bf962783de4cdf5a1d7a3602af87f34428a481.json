            "text": "Oscillatory phenomena abound in many types of signals. Identifying the individual oscillatory components that constitute an observed biological signal leads to profound understanding about the biological system. The instantaneous frequency (IF), the amplitude modulation (AM), and their temporal variability are widely used to describe these oscillatory phenomena. In addition, the shape of the oscillatory pattern, repeated in time for an oscillatory component, is also an important characteristic that can be parametrized appropriately. These parameters can be viewed as phenomenological surrogates for the hidden dynamics of the biological system. To estimate jointly the IF, AM, and shape, this paper applies a novel and robust time-frequency analysis tool, referred to as the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). The usefulness of the model and SST are shown directly in predicting the clinical outcome of ventilator weaning. Compared with traditional respiration parameters, the breath-to-breath variability has been reported to be a better predictor of the outcome of the weaning procedure. So far, however, all these indices normally require at least 20 min of data acquisition to ensure predictive power. Moreover, the robustness of these indices to the inevitable noise is rarely discussed. We find that based on the proposed model, SST and only 3 min of respiration data, the ROC area under curve of the prediction accuracy is 0.76. The high predictive power that is achieved in the weaning problem, despite a shorter evaluation period, and the stability to noise suggest that other similar kinds of signal may likewise benefit from the proposed model and SST.",

In some cases, this information is easy to read and interpret, in others, it is less accessible, and more sophisticated approaches are needed to extract the information. Many of the measured signals are oscillatory, and one particular and common technique is to focus on the oscillatory features. The fundamental quantity describing the oscillation is its period, which is defined to be the time needed for an observer to observe a \"complete and intact oscillation\"; this can be expressed by the frequency, which qualitatively is the inverse of the period, that is, it gives the number of oscillations per unit time period. For example, the periods of the ECG signal, the respiratory signal, and the circadian rhythm are about 1 s, 5 s, and 24 h, corresponding to 1 Hz, 0.2 Hz, and 11.6 mHz, respectively [2] - [5] . In recent years, growing evidence suggests that information extracted from biological signals with oscillatory features has diagnostic and prognostic value in various diseases [1] , [2] , [4] - [6] , [9] , [10] .",

            "text": "Mathematically, frequency analysis is typically studied via the Fourier transform when the signal can be assumed to be stationary. However, it has been long observed that the stationarity assumption is too restrictive for physiological signals, and more information of the physiological system can be extracted if one allows time dependence in the frequency or period. For example, the variability of the time intervals between sequential heart beats, or heart rate variability (HRV) [2] , [4] , observed in ECG signals, and the variability of the time intervals between sequential breath intakes, or respiratory rate variability (RRV) [3] , [10] - [16] are well known to be related to physiological dynamics. Accurate extraction of this type of time-varying information improves diagnostic accuracy and treatment quality [3] , [4] , [9] , [10] and much effort has been put on this direction. In general, time-varying frequency is not measured directly, but is inferred from the behavior, in time, of the oscillation-to-oscillation intervals. A well-known example is the analysis of R-peak to R-peak intervals (RRI) to reveal HRV information [4] , [9] , [17] . Many techniques have been introduced, including spectral methods and nonlinear dynamical analysis, such as Poincare map, entropy analysis, fractal analysis, to analyze these oscillation-tooscillation intervals [10] - [17] .",

Typical recorded respiratory signal from an intensive care unit patient with support from a ventilator. The arrows with a mark R indicate times in the signal where it would be difficult to identify a basic oscillation if only peaks were taken into consideration; the arrow with a mark B indicates a brief machine recalibration; the arrow with a mark G indicates an invalid respiratory trigger. This patient succeeded in ventilator weaning. physiological signals. A first limitation is the (relatively) large number of oscillations that must be observed. For example, for analysis of respiratory signals, at least 300 and 100-1000 oscillations are needed for methods that use a Poincare map [10] , [14] , [15] or approximate entropy [12] , [18] , respectively. It is feasible to collect many points for the ECG signal, since this requires only a continuous recording for about 5 min, a reasonable length for a bedside observation. For signals that function on larger time scales than the ECG signal, the story is different. For example, for respiratory signals, we normally need at least 20 min or longer to collect the necessary amount of data, which is usually difficult in certain clinical settings such as patients in intensive care unit [10] , [12] , [14] - [16] or newborns [18] . The situation would be even worse if we wanted to analyze larger time-scale physiological signals such as circadian rhythm [5] , [7] .",

Recall that this determination depends on being able to isolate individual oscillations, which requires the identification of the complete repeating basic pattern and, possibly, landmarks within the pattern. Given a suitable definition of this repeating pattern, the oscillation-to-oscillation time series is determined by finding the landmarks for each oscillation. For example, for the ECG signal, the pattern is related to the electrophysiological activity of a normal heart beat and the landmark is defined to be the R peak, and the RRI-time series is based on the R-peak detection [4] , [9] , [17] . For other physiological signals, it is not always easy to define a basic \"oscillation\" or a \"landmark,\" even for healthy subjects. For example, although we can provide a definition for respiratory signals, in practice determining the landmarks is not easy, specifically when there is invalid or doubly triggered respiration (see Fig. 1 ). This difficulty can be mitigated to some extent by noise removal or noise reduction algorithms [17] , but even then no reliable determination of the \"true\" landmarks can be guaranteed. Sometimes it is hard to even provide a universally accepted definition of a landmark, e.g., for the electroesophagographic signal.",

Extended intubation has many negative side effects, such as an increased risk for infection [28] , [29] ; ideally physicians seek to extubate as soon as medically possible.

To increase the weaning success, the present common practice is to conduct spontaneous breathing trials before a weaning attempt; the final weaning decision is based on the patient's performance during spontaneous breathing trials, characterized by parameters derived directly from the respiration signal, such as the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) [30] , and subjective evaluation by the clinician. Unfortunately, weaning failure still occurs in a significant percentage of patients who are judged ready-to-wean [28] , [29] . Recently, several RRV-based predictors have been proposed to increase the rate of success weaning in this context; these newer predictors are reported to have a higher accuracy than RSBI in predicting weaning success or failure [10] , [14] - [16] . Since the oscillation-to-oscillation time series is the focus of RRV analysis, observation of the respiration signal usually takes at least 20 min to guarantee highly significant prediction accuracy [13] - [15] . In addition, these more accurate RRV-based predictors rely on accurate timing of breath intake \"peaks\", and are thus likely subject to stability issues caused by the inevitable noise.",

In particular, all subjects are with RSBI \u2264110 breaths/min/L since we excluded patients not ready for weaning with RSBI >110 breaths/min/L before spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to the restriction from the Institutional Review Board. For each subject, we continuously recorded a 30 min flow signal at the sampling rate 100 Hz during SBT under the T-piece ventilator mode. The characteristics of these patients and the protocol to perform SBT are described in detail in [15] . These 68 subjects are divided into weaning success (n = 45) and failure (n = 23) groups, based upon their extubation outcomes. Extubation was defined to be successful if patients did not need the ventilator again for at least 48 h after extubation. Reinstitution of either noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation within 48 h of extubation was considered an extubation failure. In [15] , the data show no difference between the success and failure groups in the mean values of six clinically used weaning predictors measured before subject inclusion, and also in the mean values of three breathing pattern parameters measured after subject inclusion; in other words, the mean values of these nine clinically used weaning predictors could not allow us to discriminate success cases from failures.",

Accordingly, this cut-off value of WIN index might be helpful for the physicians to make decision which patients merit weaning from mechanical ventilation.

            "text": "At first sight, this result does not improve upon what has been reported for RRV-based predictions [14] - [16] . One should take into account, however, the following two points. First, the WIN requires only 3 min of consecutively recorded data rather than the at least 20 min typically required for the RRV-based indices; since a 3 min-observation is entirely feasible in clinical practice, whereas a 20 min-observation is much less so this is a crucial difference. Second, the definition of an oscillation and its landmark are not critical in the analysis. Note that even if the definition of an oscillation and its landmark are precisely given, the landmark detection is typically not robust under perturbations by noise, e.g., invalid breathing in the respiratory signal. Although the necessarily noisy signal can be \"denoised,\" existing noise removal or noise reduction algorithms cannot guarantee a reliable determination of the \"true\" landmarks. Even if \"oscillation-based segmentation\" could be carried out perfectly on a long enough recorded physiological signal so that enough oscillations are collected, it is not straightforward to obtain such an uninterrupted signal, in practice, especially when the period of each oscillation is large than, say, 2 s. Different kinds of interruptions during the signal record, for example, machine calibration, coughs, suction, irritation, and so on, require the signal analyst to artificially cut-and-stitch together pieces of signal so that the oscillation-to-oscillation intervals can be defined, as needed for the traditional method, even though there is no theoretical support to show that the dynamical variabilities evaluated from such manipulated time series are still as trustworthy. Similar potential disruptions typically occur in other oscillatory physiological signals. We therefore expect that the combination of the proposed phenomenological model and the analysis method, SST, have great potential in dealing with broader physiological signals than the traditional approaches, especially when the scale of the signal is large and the determination of the landmarks is not easy.",

The importance of keeping a richer description is illustrated by our method's use of variation in both frequency and amplitude in the ventilator weaning example.",

Although we do not have a definite evidence, based on the reasoning about the relationship between the decreased HRV (or RRV) and the severity of disease [2] , [4] , [14] - [16] , we hypothesize that the distinguishing power of WIN is a consequence of the possible disintegrity of the respiratory control factors, and this disintegrity leads to the decreased variability in the breathing pattern. This hypothesis indicates that the subject with decreased WIN is not completely ready for weaning, and explains why we observe the different patterns in the two groups. Also note that RRV is a different notion compared with the descriptive breathing parameters, like total volume, peak respiratory flow, total breath duration, and so on, which quantify the average behavior of one breath but not the complex integrity of the control factors.",

            "text": "This discussion would not be complete without listing the shortcomings of our approach. First, the phenomenological nature of our analysis limits the possibility to extract detailed underlying mechanisms leading to the variability and hence the prediction outcome. For example, we are not able (nor did we attempt) to distinguish if the observed variability is purely neural in origin, or if mechanical factors also play a role; finer modeling is needed to decide this, if possible. Second, from the viewpoint of estimating physiological dynamics, monitoring variability from the signal of one physiological subsystem, for example, the respiratory signal, is not sufficient: the physiological dynamics is the outcome of the complicated interactions between different physiological subsystems. Incorporating different simultaneously recorded biomedical signals, such as electrocardiograms, respiratory signal, blood pressure, and so on, should lead to a more informative description of the systematic dynamics. A study of how to extract the information on the interaction between different subsystems via the combination of the existing model and the SST algorithm is now ongoing. Specifically, although we now have a suitable method to extract information from different oscillatory physiological signals of different scales, finding their interactions and inferring more information remains an open problem. Third, the limitation inherent to the SST itself cannot be overlooked. Indeed, it is an intrinsic limitation of the SST that its estimation of the instantaneous frequency is less reliable when this instantaneous frequency has large local variations. To address this, we need a better theoretically rigorous approach to estimate the instantaneous frequency for such signals; work on this is ongoing. Finally, the study in the testbed has two limitations: it is retrospective, and the data have been collected for a small clinical population only, although the group of patients is homogeneous, in the sense that all patients are confirmed to be ready for weaning based on the RSBI. Yet it certainly warrants a follow-up prospective and large-scale clinical study to investigate its clinical applicability.",

P 2 : Since SST is local in nature, we are able to detect components that do not exist all the time and hence the dynamical behavior of the signal [20] , [21] . P 3 : The time-frequency representation S \u0393 Y (b, \u03be) is visually informative. See Fig. 3 for example. P 4 : SST is \"adaptive\" to the data in the sense that the error in the estimation depends only on the first three moments of the mother wavelet instead of the profile of the mother wavelet. See [23, Fig. 6 ] for a visual demonstration. P 5 : The existence of the trend modeled in (9) do not interfere with the SST. Thus, we are able to separate the trend and periodic components.

Also, as is discussed in [21] and the references therein, the relationship between the continuous random process and discrete time series is not always one to one. For example, not every autoregressive and moving average time series (ARMA) can be embedded into a continuous ARMA random process.

The instantaneous frequency corresponds to the dominant curve in the SST, and the amplitude modulation corresponds to the intensity upon the dominant curve (visible in the 3-D graph). Indeed, the spacing of respiration cycle is reflected by SSTIF: closer spacing corresponds to higher SSTIF values, and wider spacing to lower SSTIF values; the darker curve corresponds to higher SSTAM values, and lighter curve to lower SSTAM values. In conclusion, through reading the SST figure, we can visually see how the frequency and amplitude modulation vary according to time.",
