The paper is organised as follows: In \u00a72 we present an analysis of the effects of ACE2 missense variants on S-protein binding. We begin with an overview of missense variation at the ACE2-S interface from the Genome Aggregation Consortium Database (gnomAD 11 ) and describe how these variants could modify binding with reference to structural and mutagenesis studies ( \u00a72.1). We then apply the mCSM-PPI2 12 mutation effect predictor, which we have extensively validated against published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV Sprotein affinity assays 10 (see Methods), to predict the effect of ACE2 variants from gnomAD ( \u00a72.2) and all possible missense mutations at ACE2-S binding residues ( \u00a72.3) on SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding, and rationalise key results by a structural evaluation of the ACE2 variant models.

In total, there are 338 ACE2 coding variants in gnomAD. The majority of these are missense variants (241, including 12 in splice regions) and synonymous variants (90, including 2 in splice regions). Synonymous variants do not alter the protein sequence and are therefore unlikely to have a functional impact. In general, the impact of missense variants is dependent on the structural and functional context of the mutated residue, as well as the physicochemical characteristics of the mutant residue. Missense variants are found in all the major functional domains of ACE2, including the peptidase and collectrin domains, the transmembrane region and other functionally annotated sites (Figure 1 ). Nonsense variants including stops and frameshifts are also reported in gnomAD for ACE2. These can have a drastic effect on protein structure and expression levels, but their effect is less dependent on the residue context than missense variants. However, there is linear positional dependence since truncations close to the Cterminus are more likely to be tolerated.

ACE2 missense variants located at residues that bind the Sprotein are most likely to have such effects. Figure 2 illustrates the ACE2-S interface and highlights residues with reported missense variants in gnomAD whilst Table 1 lists these variants and their population distribution alongside key structural features of the site. Seven missense variants occur at residues we classified as directly interacting with SARS-CoV-2 S (see Methods). All these variants would be considered rare or extremely rare and are mostly private to a single gnomAD population. There are no homozygous females, but a few males are hemizygous as indicated. p.Ser19Pro is the most frequently observed ACE2-S interface variant in gnomAD. Mutations to or from Pro can have severe consequences for protein structure but as Ser19 is the first observed ACE2 residue in the structure it is difficult to predict the overall conformational consequence. This variant may be slightly deleterious to normal ACE2 function given the apparent gender imbalance in its prevalence, but the significance of this observation with respect to ACE2 activity towards SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the loss of the H-bond donor Ser, which interacts with a main chain carbonyl on S, could weaken the ACE2-S complex. The next most common missense variant at the interface is p.Glu37Lys. This variant occurs in an interface core binding site (see Methods), which have been shown to be less tolerant of mutation with respect to human pathogenic variants due to disruption of protein-protein interactions 17 . Charge inversion mutations have the capacity to be highly disruptive. Glu37 does interact with positively charged residues, but these are intraprotein interactions with ACE2 Arg393 and Lys353. Nevertheless, the excess positive charge in the variant may disfavour binding and the Lys will be unable to act as donor in the H-bond with SARS-CoV-2 S Tyr505 suggesting that this variant would be destabilising. Similar considerations hold for p.Glu35Lys. Glu35 engages with S via an H-bond to Gln493, which will be disrupted by the variant, but the effect of the charge inversion will be reduced compared to the previous variant because the neighbourhood of Glu35 includes both positive (Lys31) and negative (Glu38) charges. The site of p.Glu329Gly is close to the engineered S Arg439. Although it is not formally engaged in H-bonding or an ionic interaction by ARPEGGIO's 18 definitions, the residues are likely to interact electrostatically and has been described as an N\u2026O bridge 9 . We would therefore expect ACE2 p.Glu329Gly to have reduced affinity with the chimeric receptor in PDB 6vw1. The wild-type Asn439 will likely be too short to interact with Glu329 and the loss of charge complementarity would probably lead to the same mutation having no effect with the native SARS-CoV-2 S (see Methods for further details). The effects of ACE2 residue substitutions on coronavirus S-protein affinity have been directly observed 10 . Extensive ACE2 mutagenesis provided detailed insight into the ACE2-SARS-CoV S complex and can give some insight into the effects of ACE2 population variation in SARS-CoV-2 S binding. Table 2 lists gnomAD missense variants seen at the site of residues that were previously mutagenized 10 . Half of the ACE2 mutants listed resulted in inhibition of S-protein binding but only two mutants correspond exactly to the gnomAD variant and of these only p.Arg559Ser showed an effect on SARS-CoV S-protein binding. The other mutant also seen in gnomAD, p.His239Gln, had no reported effect on the interaction. The variant p.Lys68Glu shares physicochemical properties with the mutant Lys68Asp, which slightly inhibited interaction with SARS-CoV, and the loss of Pro389 that results from the variant p.Pro389His also had a slight reduction in binding from a Pro389Ala mutant. The only variant that is situated at an ACE2-S interacting residue and occurs at a site with a reported single-point mutant is p.Asp355Asn. The mutant Asp355Ala was reported to reduce ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S-protein to about 20 % of the wild-type 10 . This indicates that the site is important for maintaining the interaction between the proteins. There are a few caveats to the preceding analyses. The first is that our structural consideration of variants located at the interface is qualitative. For the variants that we think would be destabilising, we are unable to say how destabilising they might be and would have difficulty even ranking them. The second is that we have not ascertained how far the assay results for SARS-CoV S are applicable to SARS-CoV-2 S. Structural comparison of the two complexes could help to address this second caveat since ACE2 sites that interact with S-protein sites that are conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to respond in the same way to a mutation than where SARS-CoV-2 has a different residue. A third flaw is that we have not considered all the reported missense variants. Although variants located at the interface are most likely to have an effect, residues in proximity to the interface, but not directly a part of it, could also have an effect. Second and third degree contacts can have an effect too and even longer range substitution induced conformational effects cannot be discounted completely (although it has been shown that SARS-CoV S binding is invariant to ACE2 catalytic conformational changes 8,10 ). In \u00a72.2 we address these caveats by employing mCSM-PPI2 12 to predict changes in the ACE2-S binding energy as a result of the gnomAD variants. We integrate the experimental mutagenesis data by validating mCSM-PPI2 in this system and calibrating its predictions to the experimental observations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1714, "end": 1716, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3144, "end": 3146, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3433, "end": 3435, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 4262, "end": 4264, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 230, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 337, "end": 344, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 3332, "end": 3339, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Missense variants and the ACE2-S interface"}, {"text": "Research into the impact of missense variants at protein-protein interaction interfaces has led to methods that provide quantitative predictions of the effect of mutations on interface characteristics 12 . These predictions are an invaluable addition to insights gained from inspection of the site and its neighbourhood in the 3D structure. They can also be used to screen large numbers of variants that would be prohibitively time-consuming to process through modelling and manual inspection or experimentally. In this section, we predict the effects of ACE2 missense variation on S-protein binding by the application of the mCSM-PPI2 12 algorithm, which we extensively validated against experimental binding data for 26 ACE2 mutants in complex with the closely related SARS-CoV S (see Methods), and critically evaluate the key predictions by structural inspection. Table 3 contains mCSM-PPI2 predictions for nine ACE2 gnomAD missense variants located at or close to the S-protein interface. On the basis of our mCSM-PPI2 calibration, predicted \u0394\u0394G > +1.0 kcal/mol is a confident indication that a variant will enhance ACE2-S binding whilst \u0394\u0394G < \u22121.0 kcal/mol indicates a mutation that strongly or totally abolishes the ACE2-S interaction (see Methods). One variant is predicted to enhance binding (p.Gly326Glu) whilst three variants are predicted to strongly reduce S-protein binding. The remaining five interface variants are predicted to reduce \u0394G over the range \u22120.2 kcal/mol to \u22120.6 kcal/mol, but as they do not exceed the calibrated threshold, we consider these variants as of uncertain significance with respect to ACE2-S binding. 2.2.1 p.Gly326Glu is predicted to enhance ACE2-S interaction p.Gly326Glu is predicted to increase the affinity of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 S by 1.0 kcal/mol. Figure 3 compares the ACE2-S interface in the vicinity of Gly326 with the mCSM-PPI2 12 modelled p.Gly326Glu. Wild type Gly326 does not form any interactions with SARS-CoV-2 S, the closest approach between the proteins is 5.5 \u00c5 between ACE2 Gly326 Ca and the mainchain carbonyl of SARS-CoV-2 Thr500. The mutant p.Gly326Glu fills the void between the proteins and forms multiple H-bonding, polar and ionic interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 S backbone and residues Asn506 and Arg439. These new interactions are strongly suggestive that the mutant would lead to enhanced binding. However, the relevance of the interaction with Arg439 is uncertain because this residue was the result of a mutation (Asn439Arg) from the SARS-CoV-2 S reference (GenBank MN908947.1), engineered to enhance binding through interaction with ACE2 Glu329 9 . Modelling p.Gly326Glu in a structure with Asn at position 439 (6vw1-Asn439, Figure 3C , see Methods) yielded an identical predicted \u0394\u0394G (i.e., 1.0 kcal/mol). In 6vw1-Asn439, the lost ionic interaction with the mutant Arg is compensated by an H-bond to the main chain amine of S Val503, which is accessible to a different rotamer conformation of the mutant Glu residue, whilst retaining the H-bond with S Asn506. As well as explaining why p.Gly326Glu is still predicted to enhance binding in the SARS-CoV-2 S model with Asn439, this highlights the sort of interplay that could occur between ACE2 variants and different SARS-CoV-2 strains. In this example of an engineered S-protein, the predicted effect on \u0394\u0394G is the same for the ACE2 variant with both S-proteins but other SARS-CoV-2 S variants could interact differently with ACE2 variation. 2.2.2 p.Asp355Asn, p.Glu37Lys and p.Gly352Val are predicted to inhibit ACE2-S binding gnomAD ACE2 variants p.Asp355Asn, p.Glu37Lys and p.Gly352Val have mCSM-PPI2 \u0394\u0394G < \u22121 kcal/mol and we therefore predict that they will significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S binding or abolish it altogether. Figure 4 illustrates the structural differences between the wild-type and mutant structures of these mutants. p.Asp355Asn has the largest predicted negative \u0394\u0394G of these mutations. Wild-type Asp355 is held in place by an intraprotein ionic interaction with Arg357. The loss of this charge complementarity in the p.Asp355Asn results in a different orientation for mutant Asn that introduces a number of clashes between this residue and others nearby, including the carbonyl oxygen of Thr500 of S. These clashes might be better accommodated in free ACE2 resulting in reduced affinity for the S-protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 867, "end": 874, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1801, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2698, "end": 2707, "text": "Figure 3C", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3755, "end": 3763, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "gnomAD variants in ACE2 can significantly modify its affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S"}, {"text": "In p.Glu37Lys, a favourable interprotein H-bond between wild-type Glu37 and RBD Tyr505 is lost alongside several intraprotein polar and ionic interactions. The new hydrophobic contact between the mutant Lys37 and the same Tyr residue is likely insufficient to compensate. p.Gly352Val is the farthest variant from the interface (5.4 \u212b) that is predicted to decrease S-protein binding and does not interact directly with any SARS-CoV-2 S residue. The effect on the interface is through a fourth-degree interaction that terminates with RBD Tyr505 (i.e., Gly352(C=O)-Tyr41-Lys353-RBD Tyr505). The introduction of Val into a position occupied by the buried Gly leads to several clashes. A few favourable internal hydrophobic contacts are also formed, including with Tyr41. The rearrangements necessary to accommodate Val might affect the bridged interaction between Tyr41 and RBD Tyr505 and the increased hydrophobic packing coupled with the loss of Gly could affect reduced flexibility. These considerations support the mCSM-PPI2 prediction. Mutation of residues on or near the interface are most likely to impact the interaction affinity but distant mutations can in principle affect interfaces through longer-range conformational effects. Figure 5 shows the distribution of predicted \u0394\u0394G for 167 gnomAD ACE2 missense variants in residues resolved in PDB 6vw1. Whilst predicted \u0394\u0394Gs are biased toward a slight destabilising effect overall, the majority of variants have predicted \u0394\u0394Gs between \u22120.8 kcal/mol and 0.5 kcal/mol, suggesting that most have only a slight effect if any on ACE2-S binding. This is expected since most variants are away from the ACE2-S interface ( Figure 5C ) and distant conformational effects would be relatively rare anyway. In this case, no additional variants are found with \u0394\u0394G < \u22121.0 kcal/mol, which is consistent with experimental evidence that ACE2-S binding is agnostic towards ACE2 conformational states 10 . These data also show that variants with predicted \u0394\u0394G in excess of \u00b11 kcal/mol outlie the bulk of predictions, providing further empirical support for these thresholds. There is a second outlier with relatively high positive \u0394\u0394G that is highlighted by the probability plot ( Figure 5B ). This is p.Val447Phe with predicted \u0394\u0394G = +0.9 kcal/mol, below the strict 1 kcal/mol threshold but well in excess of the relaxed threshold that we considered may be useful for potential ACE2-S affinity enhancing variants (see Methods). If this variant did lead to enhanced ACE2-S interaction, it could contribute significantly to the risk burden of ACE2 owing to its prevalence. In gnomAD this variant is observed in 13 individuals across three populations. This result is also unusual because the variant site is nearly 40\u212b from the ACE2-S interface.

However, we were unable to discern a mechanism through which this mutant could modify ACE2-S binding as the mCSM-PPI2 mutant model showed no changes at the interface compared to wild-type. However, mCSM-PPI2 may recognise such motion in its internal model's \"atomic fluctuation\" term 12 . However, in all the mutant models provided by mCSM-PPI2 we have evaluated, none display any relaxation of the structure, local or otherwise, in response to the mutant so we are unable to consider this factor in our critical evaluation.

Rare variants with a significant effect on ACE2-S binding could have significant implications for the epidemiology of COVID-19 in addition to the consequences for affected individuals. If there were 10 such variants with an allele frequency of 1 in 50,000, their collective occurrence might be as high as 1 in 5,000 (discounting linkage) and when this is considered alongside the possibility that a high proportion of the global population will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 it becomes clear that such effects should be investigated. In other words, the genetic burden of rare variants cannot be ignored. Figure 7 illustrates the distribution of \u0394\u0394G predictions by mCSM-PPI2 from in silico saturation mutagenesis of the ACE2-S interface. Most of the 475 possible ACE2 mutations in residues at the interface with S are predicted to lead to a slight reduction in binding but there is a secondary mode < \u22121 kcal/mol containing 125 mutations that are predicted to lead to strongly reduced ACE2-S binding ( Figure 7A ). This constitutes a positive prediction rate of over 25% for inhibitory variants, a figure that is substantially higher than for the gnomAD variants (\u22482%; \u00a72.2) and the validation mutants (14%; Methods) due to the restriction of the analysis to sites at the ACE2-S interface where mutations are far more likely to effect the ACE2-S interaction. In contrast, only six mutations are predicted to result in enhanced binding at the strict \u0394\u0394G threshold of > 1.0 kcal/mol for ACE2-S affinity enhancing variants and even at the relaxed threshold of > 0.5 kcal/mol only 14 mutations are highlighted. At face value, these results suggest that there is a good chance that individuals with ACE2 missense variants at these loci would have an ACE2 variant with reduced ACE2-S binding whilst ACE2 variants with enhanced affinity for S would be far less frequent. Of the 475 possible mutations, the subset of 151 that are accessible via a single base change from the ACE2 coding sequence are more likely to be observed in the human population. Figure 7B shows the distribution of predicted \u0394\u0394G for this subset. In this subset, there are 38 substitutions distributed over 12 sites with \u0394\u0394G < \u22121.0 kcal/mol and a single substitution with \u0394\u0394G > +1.0 kcal/mol is observed (Thr27Arg). Other factors can be considered too. For instance, any methylated CpG dinucleotides in the coding sequence would be particularly variable. This effect is observed at the protein level in the high mutability of Arg residues 22 . In ACE2, the only interface residue with a CG dinucleotide is Asp38. The residue is coded by GAC and the 3 rd base is part of a CG dinucleotide. Here the CG to TG mutation leads to a synonymous change but if we consider that this mutation might recur it is worthwhile assessing accessible missense changes from this codon, in this case, GAT to GGT (Gly) or GCT (Ala) are substitutions with \u0394\u0394G < \u22121 kcal/mol.

Thr27Arg is accessible from the C>G transversion in the wild-type codon ACA results in the AGA codon for Arg. Thr27Arg has the largest predicted \u0394\u0394G of all the ACE2 binding-site mutants tested (1.4 kcal/mol) and is an apparent outlier amongst the full set of ACE2 saturation mutants ( Figure 7A ). Figure 8 illustrates the structural differences between the mutant and reference residue. Thr27 makes no specific contacts with SARS-CoV-2 S, coming closest to S Tyr489 (4.3 \u00c5). Thr27Arg is amply accommodated in the interface. The guanidium interacts with S Tyr421 and Tyr473 whilst the charge is neutralised by nearby ACE2 Asp30. The guanidium fills a space between S Tyr473 and ACE2 Glu23 at the rim of the interface (behind the plane of Figure 8 ). The additional positive charge is neutralised by interaction with ACE2 Asp30. These features of Thr27Arg are strongly supportive of its potential to enhance ACE2-S binding. (Table 4 and Figure 1 ) may affect the ratio of these ACE2 cleavage processes and consequently the availability of the TMPRSS2 ACE2 cleavage S-driven augmented entry pathway 7 . If this pathway were to prove active in SARS-CoV-2, then we could expect variants that disrupt ADAM17 cleavage to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection whilst variants that disrupt TMPRSS2 might be protective. Mutations of Arg and Lys residues in the TMPRSS2 (R697-R716) and ADAM17 (R652-K659) cleavage regions can abolish ACE2 processing by these enzymes 7 . There are five Arg substitutions in the TMPRSS2 cleavage region that could reduce TMPRSS2 processing of ACE2 and consequently confer some level of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whilst the gain of Arg mutation p.Ser709Arg could lead to increased susceptibility by increasing TMPRSS2 processing. p.Arg697Gly is particularly notable given its prevalence and apparent specificity to South Asian males (Table 4 ).

An inframe deletion variant that results in the deletion of Lys313 occurs in a single male in the non-Finnish European cohort. It is difficult to interpret the effect of this variant as it could alter the pattern of exposed residues on the helix in which it occurs. However, we think it likely that it would be structurally accommodated, particularly since the closest loop begins only a few residues away at Gly319 (Figure 1 ).

One idea is to disrupt the ACE2-S interface with small-molecule or peptide inhibitors. The descriptions of the ACE2 variants provided here can help to anticipate possible pharmacogenomic effects of variants located at the ACE2-S interface. Another promising treatment direction is the administration of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) 24, 25 . This might compete with endogenous ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 S. The approach has been proved-in-principle through the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human tissue models 25 and a clinical trial is now underway (EudraCT Number: 2020-001172-15). An earlier trial was registered (Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04287686) 24 but has since been withdrawn before enrolling participants. The affinity of the administered rhACE2 might be a crucial component of the treatments efficacy, as indicated by the fact that mouse ACE2 did not have the same effect as human ACE2 25 .

Even slightly enhanced affinity over endogenous ACE2 might shift the equilibrium towards rhACE2-S-protein complex formation and reduce the dose required for inhibition of viral infection.

These mutations are excellent candidates to improve the efficacy of rhACE2 therapy in COVID-19. We draw special attention to Gly326Glu, which corresponds to one of the gnomAD missense variants discussed earlier (see \u00a72.2.1) and may be an excellent candidate since native ACE2 activity is likely to be maintained given that the variant is observed in a population dataset. The full dataset is provided in Supplementary Data File 1. There are other criteria that should be considered to minimise the chance of disrupting the native activity of ACE2, which is thought could mitigate COVID-19 lung pathologies in addition to viral inhibition 24 . Basic considerations such as avoiding mutations to or from proline or glycine and nuanced strategies such as restricting candidates to sites with known population variants are relevant.

In SARS-CoV-2, it has been shown that the APN and DDP4 cell entry pathways are not active 1,5 , so there can be no recourse to these routes (unless mutations in these genes could establish this activity). In this work, some observed ACE2 variants were predicted to have a comparable effect on ACE2-S binding as mutants that were experimentally determined to abolish the interaction altogether.

Such effects might also lead to increased transmission from individuals with ACE2-S enhancing variants. It was suggested that enhanced ACE2-S affinity in SARS-CoV-2 versus SARS-CoV could lead to increased infection in the upper respiratory tract 5 , this hypothesis is beginning to bear out with evidence of upper respiratory tract infection 28 and higher ACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV now established 9 .

In a simplistic model, ACE2 expression modifies ACE2 membrane concentration whilst ACE2-S affinity modifies the equilibrium dissociation constant. It is conceivable then that affinity variants and expression variants compound the effect of one another, in a manner akin to that suggested for ACE2 variants and ACE2 stimulating drugs 30 , and so ACE2 haplotypes and linkage with other regulatory loci could be critical.

A male carrying a rare ACE2-S affinity enhancing variant will be worse affected than a female heterozygote. Moreover, it is conceivable that in females the more resistant ACE2 allele could rapidly become predominant in infected tissues due to selection induced by host cell turnover over infection cycles, gradually increasing the expression of the S-protein resistant ACE2 allele if present. In addition to the benefits of this selection process, this may have implications for female survivors of COVID-19 depending on the persistence X-inactivation bias and the nature of the hitchhiking alleles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 371, "end": 373, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The impact and prevalence of ACE2 variant receptor activity genotypes"}, {"text": "Although, as described above, there is clear evidence that missense variants are capable of abolishing ACE2's receptor activity towards SARS-CoV-2 S, it is complicated to estimate the prevalence of such variants in the population. The gnomAD variants predicted to reduce ACE2-S binding are all very rare. p.Glu37Lys is the most prevalent with an allele frequency (AF) 0.0003 in the gnomAD Finnish samples and it is also observed in one African/African American sample. The two other gnomAD inhibitory variants p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn are both doubletons observed only in non-Finnish Europeans, each corresponding to AF = 0.00003 in this population. Expanding on this, a simple estimation is that these two variants might confer SARS-CoV-2 resistance to just over 1 in 15,000 non-Finnish Europeans, comparable to many rare diseases. However, these are not the only potentially protective ACE2 variants. Our analysis of the effects of all possible missense mutations at the ACE2-S interface predicted that 38 substitutions accessible via single base changes at 12 sites would lead to severely reduced interaction. These substitutions account for 41 missense variants out of the possible 108 single nucleotide variants at the codons corresponding to the ACE2 residues that bind SARS-CoV-2 S. A crude upper bound under the highly conservative assumption that these variants occur at lower frequencies than the allele frequency of a singleton can be calculated. The minimum possible AF for a singleton in gnomAD non-Finnish Europeans is 8.8 \u00d7 10 -6 . Since we are calculating the effect of 41 unobserved variants, their joint frequency (assuming no linkage) is 3.6 \u00d7 10 -4 , which is equivalent to 72 variants per 200,000 alleles or 7.2 per 10,000 population. A more sophisticated estimate takes account of the empirical detection of rare variants in ACE2. For example, there are 1,181 variant alleles in 56,885 non-Finnish Europeans arising from variants with AF < 0.01 in the 2,415 nucleotide ACE2 coding sequence (n.b. at this AF threshold, 90 % are missense). This amounts to a variation rate of about 4.3 \u00d7 10 -6 per nucleotide per allele. So, at the 12 sites (36 nucleotides) with variants predicted to strongly reduce ACE2-S binding we could roughly expect 1.6 \u00d7 10 -4 variants per allele or 31 variants per 100,000 population. This is another conservative estimate for these sites since surface residues tend to be more variable than the core or other functional regions of the protein 32 . Finally, since 41 out of 108 possible SNPs at these 12 sites are predicted to lead to a strongly reduced ACE2-S interaction, we can multiply by this proportion to estimate the number that might strongly reduce ACE2-S binding. This yields an estimate that 11.8 individuals per 100,000 population possess an ACE2 allele that is predicted to be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The impact and prevalence of ACE2 variant receptor activity genotypes"}, {"text": "Although these rough estimates suggest that highly resistant ACE2 alleles are extremely rare it is important to note that allele frequencies show significant variation even between large variation datasets 33 .

Also, we have only considered ACE2 variants that are predicted to result in a strong reduction or total abolition of ACE2-S binding. Our data also suggests that ACE2 interface mutants tend to at least slightly reduce ACE2-S binding and this means that there will be a higher prevalence of ACE2 alleles with this property.

Two reports have found polymorphisms in ACE2 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) vary between populations but both concluded there was no clear evidence regarding ACE2 missense variants 4,31 . Why did neither of these studies find evidence that ACE2 missense variants could be associated with variable population specific epidemiology? First, Rosanna et al. 31 acknowledge that there is no conclusive evidence that apparent cross-population differences in COVID-19 epidemiology are not accounted for by population demography 31 , which raises the possibility that population differences in allele frequencies and burden are meaningless in the context of COVID-19 genetics. Nevertheless, the detection of decreased TMPRSS2 burden in Italians and Europeans compared to East Asians 31 showed that the approach could turn up interesting results with rational mechanistic interpretations. A potential prejudice against the resolution of COVID-19 genetic association with ACE2, and one that highlights an application of our work, is the inclusion criteria for variants in burden tests. Standard filtering strategies based on predicted variant severity may have worked well for TMPRSS2 where SARS-CoV-2 exploits its native catalytic function 5 , but ACE2 mediated SARS-CoV-2 cell entry does not require ACE2 catalytic activity 10 and as a result these filters might be counterproductive. Inclusion criteria for missense variants might be better based on their predicted effect on S-protein affinity, differentiating variants predicted to reduce ACE2-S affinity from those that enhance it since they may have opposite effects (Table 3) , or potential to mitigate some other SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway such as TMPRSS2 or ADAM17 cleavage region variants (Table 4) . Moreover, it might be useful to test missense variants with specific effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection separately, to isolate these features from the other roles ACE2 may have in COVID-19 pathology.

We extended our predictions to all possible ACE2 missense variants that interact with SARS-CoV-2 S. We found that mutations that lead to reduced ACE2-S interaction affinity are far more likely than mutations that lead to increased interaction. Simple estimates of the prevalence of ACE2 resistance conveying alleles suggest that the most protective alleles will be very rare (12-70 per 100,000 population) and potential risk factors will be rarer but the possibility of higher prevalence in local or underrepresented populations remains. Also, weaker effects, which are more common, could be amplified by ACE2 expression polymorphisms. This is consistent with the high rate of asymptomatic and mild infections and the rarity of severe disease in low-risk groups. A further candidate risk factor variant was identified in this analysis, Thr27Arg. Finally, we described how the mCSM-PPI2 predicted mutant affinities could be used to enhance the potency of a recombinant ACE2 therapy that is currently undergoing clinical trial 24, 25 in COVID-19.

If mCSM-PPI2 can be shown to perform well here, then we expect good performance for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein affinities, potentially approaching the accuracy displayed in the evaluation of the alanine scan dataset. Methods Figure 1A illustrates the performance of mCSM-PPI2 \u0394\u0394G as a predictor for the experimentally determined S-protein interactions. The experimental affinities are positively correlated with predicted \u0394\u0394G (\u03c1 = 0.68) so that mutants in ACE2 that strongly reduced or abolished SARS-CoV S interaction (S-) tend to have lower predicted \u0394\u0394G than mutants with little or no effect on the interaction (S+). In detail, five of the seven S-mutations have predicted \u0394\u0394G between -2 and \u22121 kcal/mol whilst most S+ mutations have predicted \u0394\u0394G > \u22120.5 kcal/mol. The remaining two S-mutants, Lys31Asp and Lys353His, received \u0394\u0394G predictions > \u22120.5 kcal/mol, which is within the range displayed by the bulk of S+ mutants. Two S+ mutants received slightly lower \u0394\u0394G predictions than most other S+ mutants, but still well above \u22121 kcal/mol. These results suggest that \u0394\u0394G < \u22121.0 kcal/mol yields a confident prediction that the mutation strongly inhibits or abolishes ACE2-S interaction (rule-in threshold) whilst \u0394\u0394G > \u22120.5 kcal/mol is indicative that the mutation has little to no effect on the interaction (rule-out threshold). \u0394\u0394G predictions between these limits are relatively sparse but S+ mutations received predicted \u0394\u0394G as low as \u22120.73 kcal/mol whilst the first inhibitory mutant had predicted \u0394\u0394G \u22121.17 kcal/mol. Table 7 shows the concordance between the experimental result and the mCSM-PPI2 prediction setting a prediction threshold at \u0394\u0394G < \u22121.0 kcal/mol.

The discordance between the mCSM-PPI2 prediction and experiment for Lys353His is surprising because mCSM-PPI2 correctly identifies the other Lys353 mutants, Lys353Ala and Lys353Asp, as causing a severe reduction in the ACE2-S interaction. Methods Figure 2 compares the interactions of the wild-type and mutant complexes at these sites. The size of the residues is a clear difference between the mutants, resulting in fewer hydrophobic contacts in the Lys353Ala and Lys353Asp mutants. Additionally, Lys353His can form ring-ring interactions with Tyr759 on the RBD, which could compensate for the fewer hydrophobic contacts in this mutant. These considerations go some way to explain why Lys353His is predicted to have less impact on ACE2-S binding than Lys353Ala or Lys353Asp, but they do not explain the discrepancy with the experimental result. One factor that might be at play is that the protonation state of the mutant His could modulate its inhibition of ACE2 S binding and this might not be well-modelled by mCSM-PPI2. The second misclassified mutation is another Lys mutant. Methods Figure 3 shows the environment of ACE2 Lys31 and Lys31Asp. The sidechain of Lys31 is oriented away from the SARS-CoV S interface allowing the Lys \u03b2-and \u0263-carbons to form hydrophobic interactions with S Tyr442 and Tyr475. In free ACE2, Lys31 is oriented outward and is fully exposed and it has been suggested that the internal neutralisation of Glu35 by Lys31 in the ACE2-S complex is required for efficient binding 39 . In Lys31Asp, there are fewer hydrophobic interactions, but the carboxyl group forms an H-bond with Tyr442 that could compensate. These interactions might explain the relatively small predicted \u0394\u0394G of \u22120.25 kcal/mol and it could be that mCSM-PPI2 does not recognise the importance of the internal neutralisation for binding. Our validation set does not include any mutants predicted to enhance ACE2-S binding. The potential candidates we found were mutant ACE2 orthologs with humanising mutations 10 but we were unable to find a suitable experimentally determined protein structure to model these mutations. In the absence of these data we are unable to validate or calibrate mCSM-PPI2 explicitly for ACE2 variants that are predicted to enhance S binding but there are a few options to address this deficit. First, we recognise that the ability to predict mutations that increase \u0394G as well as those that lower \u0394G was part of the design specification for mCSM-PPI2 12 . This objective was advanced by extending the mutant affinity training data with hypothetical reverse mutations to mitigate the bias towards destabilising mutations 12 . With this in mind, we could simply accept this stated capability of the algorithm at face value and assume a symmetric threshold of +1.0 kcal/mol to identify mutations that will significantly enhance binding. This is technically equivalent to extrapolating the relationship between \u0394\u0394G and experimental ACE2-S association (Methods Figure 1A ) past 0 kcal/mol, which warrants some explanation. Forward extrapolation of the linear trend in Methods Figure 1A above 0 kcal/mol would yield predicted assay results > 100 %, reaching \u2248 200 % by +2.0 kcal/mol. Although values greater than 100% were observed in the experimental binding assay (and are valid) 10 , the assay is bounded above by an unknown quantity that in our estimation should correspond to the inverse of the ratio of immunoprecipitated ACE2 by the C-terminal tag antibody to the total amount of ACE2 in the sample. This ceiling represents the point at which all mutant ACE2 is immunoprecipitated by the S1-Ig fusion protein used in the original assay 10 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1610, "end": 1612, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 352, "end": 360, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1203, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 3084, "end": 3093, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3199, "end": 3208, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Prediction of missense variant effects on S-protein -ACE2 interaction"}, {"text": "An alternative approach is hinted at by the reverse mutations the mCSM-PPI2 developers used to augment their training dataset with complex stabilising mutations.

This means that the reverse mutations of the experimental mutants that inhibit binding lead to enhanced binding. These can be readily modelled, for example, to model the reverse mutation for Asp355Asn we submitted the mCSM-PPI2 model of Asp355Asn and requested a prediction for Asn355Asp. Methods Figure 1B illustrates the relationship between the experimental binding assays and predicted \u0394\u0394G reverse . Generally, \u0394\u0394G reverse follows our expectations (Methods Figure 1C) , with most \u0394\u0394G reverse > 0 kcal/mol and displaying a negative linear correlation with \u0394G forward (\u03c1 = \u22120.78), but there are a few moderate outliers amongst the S-mutations with apparently underestimated \u0394\u0394G reverse . These outliers contribute to a reduction in correlation with the experimental assays compared to that achieved with the forward mutations (Methods Figure 1B , \u03c1 = 0.41), which leads to poorer performance as a predictor of the assay results (Methods Figure 1B ). An overall reduction in concordance was expected, since starting from predicted models runs the risk of compounding errors, but it is not clear if the reduced sensitivity is due to generally poorer sensitivity of mCSM-PPI2 towards mutations that enhance affinity or a consequence of these errors.
