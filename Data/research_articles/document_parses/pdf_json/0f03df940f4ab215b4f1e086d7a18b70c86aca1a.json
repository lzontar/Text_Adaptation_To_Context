            "text": "Many countries have passed their first COVID-19 epidemic peak. Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, Dc, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above Dc traditional epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find Dc \u223c 7.2. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.",

Herd immunity levels depend on the disease. For influenza it is within the range of 33-44% of the population [3] for Ebola it is 33-60% [4] , for measles 92-95% [4] , and for SARS levels between 50-80% are reported [5] . For the current COVID-19 outbreak it is expected to be in the range of 29-74% [6, 7] . On way towards herd immunity, textbook knowledge teaches, the number of infected increases faster-than-linear (in early phases even exponentially) as long as the effective reproduction number is larger than 1. Once this threshold is passed, the daily increments in the numbers of infected starts to decrease until it drops to zero [1, 8] . Combining these two growth phases gives the characteristic S-shaped infection curves.",

Several countries have clearly passed the maximum of the epidemic, and are converging towards zero new cases per day. None of these countries are even close to herd immunity. In Austria at the hight of the pandemic, a population-wide representative PCR study showed that only about 0.3% of the population were tested positive [9] . Similarly, in Iceland in a randompopulation screening the prevalence of positively tested was found to be 0.8% [10] . Clearly, the COVID-19 outbreak is far from the uncontrolled case as many countries have implemented non-pharmacautical interventions to reduce infection rates [11] . 1 : Cumulative numbers of positively tested cases normalized to the last day (May 8, 2020). Countries, even though many followed radically different strategies in response to the pandemic, seem to belong to one of three groups: (a) Countries with a remarkably extended linear increase of the cumulated number of positively tested cases, including the US, UK and Sweden. (b) Countries with an extended linear increase that tend to level off and enter a regime with a smaller slope. Inset shows extended regime after the peak (cases per population size).",

For wide range of countries regardless of size, demographic and ethnic composition, or geo-location, this linear growth pattern is apparent even by a plain-eye inspection of the number of positive cases, see e.g. [12] . In Fig. 1 (a) we show infection curves (number of confirmed positive cases) for the US, UK, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Indonesia, and a province of Canada. Clearly, after a short initial exponential phase, infection curves are practically linear for several weeks. For many other exam-ples, see [12] . Many countries that implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions in response to the COVID-19 crisis [11], show a different pattern. They also show an extended linear growth, however, infection curves tend to bend and level off in response to the implemented measures, see Fig. 1 (b) . The extent of the linear regime depends on the onset of the measures [11] . Many countries that are in the early phase of the pandemic are in still (May 8, 2020) show the initial almost exponential growth, see SI Fig. 5 . According to basic epidemiological concepts, growth patterns with extended linear regions are not to be expected. They can only be observed if the infection growth rate equals the recovery rate, giving an effective reproduction number, R(t), of 1. Chances of observing such a behaviour over an extended period of time in a country are extremely tiny, let alone in several countries. Mathematically speaking, linear growth is basically a measure zero solution in compartmental models.",

If the number of tests is limited on every day only and assuming a fixed ratio of confirmed cases per test, linear growth in the number of positively tested would be the consequence.

For instance, given a basic reproduction number of R 0 \u223c 3, we effectively reach herd immunity if two out of three contacts are avoided.

            "text": "Here we try to understand the origin of the extended linear regime in infection curves, as currently observed in the number of positively tested cases in COVID-19 pandemic across many countries. To this end we solve the SIR model on a simple social network and report a hitherto unobserved transition from linear growth to Sshaped infection curves. We show that for a given transmission rate there exists a critical degree below which linear growth is expected and above which the model reproduces the classical SIR results. Below this critical degree the mean-field approximation starts to fail. For the underlying social networks we use a Poissonian small-world network that tries to capture several empirical facts, including a heterogenous number of social links (degree), the small-world aspect, the fact that people tend to live in small groups (families), that these groups overlap, and that work and leisure relations can link distant groups; see Methods. The framework allows us to model a lockdown as a change of social networks with a high degree to one with a degree that characterizes the members of a household. Based on data on household size in the EU [20] , empirical estimates on how long individuals are contagious, and on transmission (or attack) rates we are able to calibrate the model to real countries. In particular we compare the situation in the USA and Austria. These countries differ remarkably in size and the measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [11] . While Austria imposed a lockdown relatively early on in combination with a number of other measures, the US has implemented measures hesitantly with the consequence that the situation was \"not under control\", as Dr A. Fauci, an advisor to the Trump administration, has put it on May 12, 2020 [21] . The model reproduces the real infection curves to a remarkable degree. All parameters are empirically motivated, there are no fitted parameters involved.",

The small-world aspect allows us to model transmission between local groups and \"superspreaders\" [22] . As in a SIR model, every individual is in one of three possible states, susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). If an individual is infected it will infect its susceptible neighbours with a per-day transmission probability, r. This means that on every single day the probability of passing the infection to a susceptible neighbour is r, which is sometimes called the microscopic spreading rate [16] . Once a person is infected it stays infectious for d consecutive days. After this the person can no longer infect others, and is called recovered. Once recovered the state will no longer change.

If we assume that on average about 30% of all of our social relations are outside of our household, we set = 0.3. This is a somewhat arbitrary choice, however, note that deep in the linear regime, is found to be an almost irrelevant parameter that does not influence the outcome in significant ways. To model the lockdown that was imposed in Austria on Mar 16, 2020 we assume that its effect is basically to reduce social contacts to within households, and eliminate any other contacts. For this scenario we assume D = 2.5, and = 0. Finally, for the daily transmission rate we set r = 0.0149. This choice is motivated by estimates of the COVID-19 individual-level secondary attack rate (SAR) in the household setting, which is reported at about 19%, [26] , and the relation r = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 SAR) 1/d .

For the network A we use a Poissonian small-world network, which generalizes the usual regular small-world network in the sense that the degree is not fixed, but is chosen from a Poissonian distribution, characterized by \u03bb. The network is created by first imposing a Poissonian degree sequence on all nodes. Assume that nodes are arranged on a circle. Nodes are then linked to their closest neighboring nodes on the circle. This creates a situation where every person is member of a small local community. As for real families, these communities strongly overlap. Finally, as for the conventional small-world network, with probability we re-link the links of every node i to a new, randomly chosen target node j, which can be far away in terms of distance on the circle. is the fraction of an individual's social contacts that are outside the local community (family). These links can be seen as links to colleagues at work or leisure activities, and allow us to model the existence of superspreaders [22] .

(d) Infection curve P (t) (blue dots) for the model on a dense Poissonian small-world network, D = 8. The daily cases (red) first increase and then decrease. For comparison, we show the recovered cases, R(t), of the corresponding SIR model with \u03b3 = 1/d, and \u03b2 = rD/N (green). The mean-field conditions are obviously justified to a large extent. (e) Situation for the same parameters except for a lower average degree, D = 3. The infection curve now increases almost linearly; daily increases are nearly constant for a long time.
