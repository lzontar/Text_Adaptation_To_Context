As such, IB researchers have proposed conventional risk management approaches to terrorism focused on avoidance, hedging, and insurance (Howell, 2001) . These approaches made sense when the terrorist threat to multinational enterprises (MNEs) emanated primarily from provincial urban guerrilla organizations and their rural, peasant-based counterparts, which bombed oil pipelines, destroyed property, and kidnapped and assassinated business executives and bankers as part of their national liberation campaigns and struggles against Western imperialism (Goldberg, 1990) .

After all, very few firms experience terrorism-related casualties and property destruction, whereas a multitude may experience the indirect effects of terrorist incidents, which run the compartmentalized emergencies, provide little guidance for corporate decision-makers faced with a \"new cosmology or risks\" (Lagadec, 2009) which are much broader in scale and scope than those of the past.

A growing literature suggests that firms adopting this kind of proactive approach toward security may not only be better positioned to safeguard lives, physical which has engendered high levels of trust and loyalty amongst workers and strong employee-management ties, its sound financial management, and an appropriate business model.

Both incidents involved amphibious landings, hostage takings, and the use of firearms and grenades. The response of Israel's commandos to the earlier siege, however, was quite different.

Among their targets were two of the city's landmark fivestar properties: the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and the Oberoi Trident complex. Western tourists and businesspeople appear to have been singled out by the assailants for execution, and the final death toll included 28 foreign nationals (Rabasa et al., 2009). 2 After storming the landmark properties, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) gunmen fired on guests and staff, hurled grenades down staircases, set off improvised explosive devices (IEDs), took hostages as human shields, set fires, and engaged the Indian security forces in firefights. Throughout the siege the assailants received tactical guidance via mobile phone from their controllers in Pakistan, enabling them to navigate the properties with deadly precision. The net result was devastating: three dozen killed at the Taj, scores more wounded, and untold millions of dollars in damage to the colonial-era Third, the terrorists have discovered that a successful attack on a five-star property can yield rewards equivalent to an attack on an embassy, including scores of casualties, widespread panic, and extensive media attention-all of which are a boon to recruitment.

Following the USled coalition intervention in Afghanistan after 9/11, al Qaeda evolved from a highly centralized organization to a much flatter entity. 7 Today, the global jihadist movement founded by Osama bin Laden comprises the remnants of the Saudi exile's al Qaeda organization ensconced along Pakistan's rugged northwest frontier; loosely affiliated regional franchises such as LeT in Pakistan, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) in Indonesia, and the Abu Sayaaf Group in the Philippines; \"homegrown\" militants such as those that carried out the July 2005 (7/7) London transportation system bombings; and legions of sympathizers around the as the Marriott and Sheraton, which together have been attacked 10 times since 9/11.

The reasons are myriad: First, hotels are symbolic targets of Western affluence and influence that attract precisely the kind of people the militants seek to eliminate-foreign diplomats, businesspeople, tourists, and local elites. Second, luxury hotels, like restaurants, night clubs, shopping malls, and public transportation systems, are \"soft targets,\" presenting few obstacles to determined terrorists. Indeed, hotels are open environments with multiple points of entrance and egress and a constant flow of traffic, including hotel guests and visitors, staff, merchants, and delivery people. Hotels also lend themselves to preattack reconnaissance, with floor plans, photos, and panoramic video clips of public areas often available over the Internet.

After all, opting for avoidance may involve ceding promising opportunities in growing markets to competitors, while control is exceedingly difficult to achieve against terrorist networks that are resourceful, adaptive, resilient, and comprised of operatives willing to kill themselves in the process of carrying out their deeds.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 649, "text": "21", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Implications for Business Travelers"}, {"text": "To succeed in this new environment, it is becoming abundantly clear that MNEs need to make Miller's third strategy (i.e, \"cooperation\") a priority.

Some of these alliances may be ad hoc and short-lived, whereas others may be more enduring. An example of the latter is the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), a voluntary public-private partnership initiative launched by US Customs and Border Protection in November 2001, that offers the promise of expedited customs clearance and fewer inspections to importers that conduct security audits of their supply chains and correct vulnerabilities that could be exploited by terrorists.

Writing in the Journal of International Business Studies in 1984, Jeffrey D. Simon offered a framework for conceptualizing political risk that remains influential (e.g., Alon et al., 2006; Czinkota et al., 2010) . He argued that terrorist attacks represented a direct-internal risk that emanated from the host society-in the same league as protests, strikes, riots, and demonstrations. By contrast, expropriations, restrictions on remittances, wage and price controls, and the like represented direct-internal political risks, stemming from the host government. While Simon did not analyze corporate response to political risk in great detail, the implications for MNEs seeking to minimize their exposure to terrorism and sociopolitical violence were fairly straightforward: carefully scan the environment for signs of strife and avoid countries prone to instability and unrest (Kobrin, 1982) , delay investments to the extent possible (Rivoli & Salorio 1996) , limit their size and scope (Delios & Henisz, 2000) , and purchase political risk insurance (Wells, 1998) . Miller (1992) took up the issue of how to conceptualize corporate response to both the types of political risks catalogued by Simon and those of a nonpolitical nature. His framework for integrated risk management identified both financial and strategic approaches for managing environmental uncertainty. The former included activities that could be pursued without altering corporate strategy, such as purchasing insurance and futures contracts, whereas the latter comprised five strategies: avoidance, control, cooperation, imitation, and flexibility. MNEs have traditionally dealt with the terrorist menace by employing the first two of Miller's five strategies: avoidance and control. Avoidance has typically been achieved by forgoing business opportunities in countries prone to terrorism or locating operations in remote areas of the country, whereas control has been accomplished through investments in security training for executives and perimeter fortifications for facilities (Ackerman, 2008) .

They can reduce their exposure to attack, protect lives and assets, enhance enterprise resilience, and satisfy shareholder and stakeholder demands for greater care and due diligence. And to the extent that customers begin to place more value on safety in the face of heightened risks and uncertainties, companies regarded as security leaders stand to reap significant financial benefits. establishing emergency building evacuation procedures.
