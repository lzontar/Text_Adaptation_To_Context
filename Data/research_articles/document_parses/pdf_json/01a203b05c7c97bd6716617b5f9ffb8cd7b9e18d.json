They can be divided into agents with relatively broad, non-targeted specificity and targeted drugs developed on the basis of a more refined understanding of individual cancers and directed at specific molecular targets on different cancer cells. Individual drugs in both groups have been classified on the basis of their mechanism of action in killing cancer cells. The targeted drugs include proteasome inhibitors, toxic chimeric proteins and signal transduction inhibitors such as tyrosine kinase (non-receptor and receptor), serine/threonine kinase, histone deacetylase and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Increasingly used targeted vascular (VEGF) and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor blockade can provoke a range of pathological consequences. Many of the nontargeted drugs are cytotoxic, suppressing haematopoiesis as well as provoking cutaneous eruptions and vascular, lung and liver injury. Cytotoxic side effects of the targeted drugs occur less often and usually with less severity, but they show their own unusual adverse effects including, for example, a lengthened QT interval, a characteristic papulopustular rash, nail disorders and a hand-foot skin reaction variant. The term hypersensitivity is widely used across a number of disciplines but not always with the same definition in mind, and the terminology needs to be standardised. This is particularly apparent in cancer chemotherapy where anti-neoplastic druginduced thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, vascular disorders, liver injury and lung disease as well as many dermatological manifestations sometimes have an immune basis. The most insidious of all adverse consequences of targeted therapies, however, are tumour adaptation, increased malignancy and the invasive metastatic switch seen with anti-angiogenic drugs that inhibit the VEGF-A pathway. Adverse reactions to 44 non-targeted and 33 targeted, frequently used, chemotherapeutic drugs are presented together with discussions of diagnosis, premedications, desensitizations and importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the various drug-induced reactions. There is need for wide-ranging acceptance of what constitutes a hypersensitivity reaction and for allergists to be more involved in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of chemotherapeutic drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "definition is unlikely, that proposed by Edwards and Aronson [2] seems adequate: 'An appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product'. Meanwhile, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an adverse event as 'any undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product in a patient' and states that any such serious event should be reported to the FDA [3] . A patient event is regarded as 'serious' when the outcome is death, life-threatening, hospitalisation, disability or permanent damage, congenital anomaly/birth defect, required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage (devices) and other serious important medical events (for example, allergic bronchospasm, serious blood dyscrasias or seizures or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 61, "end": 64, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 604, "end": 607, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "ADRs have been classified into seven different reaction types A to G with group A termed augmented pharmacologic effects; B, bizarre; C, chronic (or continuous effects); D, delayed effects; E, end-of-treatment (or withdrawal) effects; F, failure of therapy and G, genetic reactions [2, 4] . For our purposes, types A and B, distinguished primarily on the basis of dose-related and nondose-related reactions, respectively, are the reactions of main concern. Type A reactions are said to account for \u223c80 % of ADRs; reactions are predictable, can be anticipated from the drug's pharmacological actions and are dose-dependent and resolve when the dose is reduced or withdrawn. Type B, or unpredictable reactions, sometimes called idiosyncratic drug reactions, are generally unrelated to the drug's pharmacological actions and are independent of dose and usually (but not always) resolve when treatment is stopped. Type B reactions can be divided into immune-mediated or true allergic responses and non-immune, non-allergic sensitivities ( Table 1 ). The immunebased category is made up of the true hypersensitivities defined by Gell and Coombs: type I, IgE antibody-mediated reactions; type II, cytotoxic reactions; type III, immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivities and type IV, delayed, cell-mediated responses [5] . Three type B non-immune drug sensitivities are recognized: pseudoallergy, idiosyncratic reactions and type B intolerances. Examples of the four allergic and three non-allergic sensitivities of type B ADRs are summarized side by side in Table 1 . Many drugs that cause ADRs are not limited to one type of reaction, and some, such as the penicillins and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be involved in up to four (including all four types of hypersensitivities) or even more different adverse responses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 282, "end": 285, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 286, "end": 288, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1314, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1035, "end": 1042, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1560, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "The term hypersensitivity is a much misused term even within its 'home' discipline of allergy/immunology. In 2001, the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) published a EAACI Position Statement entitled, in part, 'A revised nomenclature for allergy' [6] . Following this lead, the World Allergy Organization (WAO) set about promoting what was described as acceptable nomenclature for allergic diseases with the stated ultimate goal of improving communication in the field of allergy. In 2003, the WAO Nomenclature Review Committee defined 'hypersensitivity' as 'objectively reproducible symptoms and signs initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus at a dose tolerated by normal persons' [7] . Far from improving communication (and apart from the absence of any reference to the adverse nature of a reaction), this definition creates confusion in the mind of workers familiar with the accepted Gell and Coombs classification based on four types of hypersensitivities. It is also difficult for those reading and attempting to understand the existing allergy/immunology literature where 'hypersensitivity' is generally taken to mean adverse signs and symptoms initiated by an antigenic stimulus that is tolerated by a 'normal' person and which has an immune component or basis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 276, "end": 279, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 715, "end": 718, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hypersensitivity reactions to drugs"}, {"text": "Long-term usage of the terms immediate, delayed, cellmediated and types I, II, II and IV hypersensitivity has become in-grained and synonymous with immune reactions.

In these cases, such reactions can be described as 'sensitivities' or 'intolerances' rather than 'nonallergic hypersensitivity' recommended by the WAO.

Unfortunately, and for a number of reasons, medical/scientific classification of these reactions is often deficient, and this is particularly apparent for many adverse reactions incorrectly described as 'hypersensitivities' [10] and for others where that description was not applied when it was clearly appropriate. In the area of side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs then, the picture is confusing and in need of standardisation in both definitions and the use of terms. The term 'hypersensitivity' remains widely used, for example in the oncology literature, clinical trial reports, pharmaceutical company drug descriptions and pharmacological studies but clearly it does not always mean the same thing-no common definition has been adopted within and between disciplines. The word is often used to cover reactions that clearly have no immune basis and which are otherwise not easy to classify [11] . On the other hand, since mechanisms for many drug reactions are not known, generally not investigated and appropriate tests are either not at hand or even developed, some true hypersensitivities remain unrecognised and therefore incorrectly classified.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 559, "end": 563, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hypersensitivity reactions to drugs"}, {"text": "3 Chemotherapeutic drugs and their classification on the basis of mechanism of action The number of drugs used for the treatment of the many different cancers is in excess of 100 and growing [12, 13] and this is reflected in the numbers approved by the FDA, those awaiting approval, entries in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug dictionary and new drugs being assessed in clinical trials [13, 14] . Many of the compounds used in chemotherapy for many years have cytotoxic properties arising from a limited number of different mechanisms of action. These drugs represent a wide range of chemical structures and include, amongst other actions, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, cytoskeletal disruptors and drugs that directly affect DNA or protein synthesis [15] . These are all agents with relatively broad, rather than targeted and specific, modes of action. Alkylating agents like busulfan, nitrogen mustards and the platinum-based agent cisplatin that crosslink DNA; antimetabolite nucleoside analogues like gemcitabine; inhibitors of mitotic cell division by taxanes and Vinca alkaloids; drugs that intercalate with DNA like actinomycin D; pyrimidine analogues including 5-fluorouracil and folate antimetabolites such as pemetrexed are typical examples of non-targeted drugs Type B are so-called 'bizarre' reactions. Uncommon relative to type A ('augmented', pharmacologic effects) reactions, unpredictable, rarely dosedependent and unrelated to drug's pharmacologic action. Reactions show high mortality relative to other categories of ADRs ppi proton pump inhibitors, NSAIDs non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 1 Defined and classified according to Gell and Coombs [5] that contrast with drugs developed from current strategies based on a more refined understanding of individual cancers and a research focus on selected molecular targets for specific types of cancers [15] . Signal transduction inhibitors which include tyrosine kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and proteasome inhibitors are examples of the latter approach [16] . The literature contains a number of different classifications of chemotherapeutic agents based on chemical structure (e.g. alkylsulphonates, anthracyclines, diterpines, organoplatinum agents), mechanisms of action, broad pharmacological categories (e.g. antibiotics, hormones), plant origin (taxanes, Vinca alkaloids) and where drugs act in the cell cycle (S, M, G1 or G2 phase). In many published classifications, these different categories are mixed together, for example, as divisions into alkylating agents, antibiotics, topoisomerase inhibitors, drugs derived from plants etc. (see, for example, [17] ) rather than a division based on a single criterion such as mechanism of action or chemical class. Of course, any classification based on a single shared factor/ property for all chemotherapeutic drugs is not straight forward. Many of the drugs show more than one mechanism of action, chemical structures even within one group can be quite diverse (e.g. alkylating agents) and some features (e.g. being plantderived) are seen in only a few compounds. The classification selected here is based firstly on the division into non-targeted ( Table 2 ) and targeted drugs (Table 3) and then on what is currently known of each drug's mechanism(s) of action.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 195, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 196, "end": 199, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 394, "end": 398, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 399, "end": 402, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 764, "end": 768, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1627, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1683, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1884, "end": 1888, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2663, "end": 2667, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3206, "end": 3213, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 3235, "end": 3244, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Hypersensitivity reactions to drugs"}, {"text": "The anti-cancer action of traditional drugs used for chemotherapy depends on their capacities to destroy rapidly dividing uncontrolled cancer cells via their cytotoxic properties or by causing the cells to undergo apoptosis. However, these drugs also harm normal rapidly dividing cells such as those in the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow and hair follicles causing well-known side effects like mucositis, stomatitis, myelosuppression and alopecia. This absence of targeted specificity contrasts with the current strategy of selectively killing a particular type of cancer cell. Some of the earliest anti-neoplastic drugs were alkylating agents that act by damaging DNA. A number of chemically different types of alkylating chemicals such as nitrogen mustards (e.g. chlorambucil), alkyl sulphonates (busulfan), nitrosoureas (carmustine), triazines (dacarbazine) and ethylenimines (altretamine) ( Table 2 ) are still administered to cancer patients. Anti-metabolites made up essentially of pyrimidine analogues (e.g. 5-fluorouracil), nucleoside analogues (gemcitabine) and anti-folates (methotrexate) form a second large group of what are still the most widely used cytostatic/cytotoxic drugs in cancer therapy. A third group, the mitotic inhibitors containing the important taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel, inhibit mitotic cell division by binding to microtubules while L -asparaginase is an important example of a small number of drugs that affect leukemic cells by disrupting protein synthesis. A chemically diverse variety of structures comprising many different drugs is used for chemotherapy by virtue of the direct drug effects on DNA (Table 2) . This group includes inhibitors of DNA synthesis such as hydroxyurea, a number of structurally different compounds (organoplatinum agents, the antibiotic mitomycin C and pyrrolobenzodiazepines [132] ) that cross-link DNA, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, drugs such as the antibiotic mitomycin C that intercalate between DNA base pairs, inhibitors of DNA methylation (azacitidine), bleomycin which induces breaks in DNA and inhibitors of the poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes that are critical in the maintenance of DNA integrity and repair [133] . PARP inhibitors appear to trap PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes at damaged DNA sites. These trapped enzyme-DNA complexes block DNA replication and are highly toxic to cells. In fact, it has been suggested that PARP inhibitors should be assessed on their potency to trap PARP as well as on their capacities to inhibit the enzymes. As shown in Table 2 , some chemotherapeutic drugs demonstrate more than one anti-tumour activity. For example, the platinum drugs which cross-link DNA and are sometimes classified along with the alkylating agents and the anthracycline antibiotics daunorubicin (or daunomycin) and doxorubicin (adriamycin) show both topoisomerase II inhibitory activity and also intercalate between base pairs in the DNA helix thus preventing DNA replication and protein synthesis. Lenalidomide [134] , listed in Table 2 in the 'miscellaneous' group, is related to the teratogenic drug thalidomide. It has a number of different activities suggesting its application to a range of haematological and solid tumours.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1850, "end": 1855, "text": "[132]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2223, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 3024, "end": 3029, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 900, "end": 907, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1655, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 2559, "end": 2566, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 3042, "end": 3049, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Non-targeted drugs"}, {"text": "Specific and effective targeting of tumour cells without accompanying toxicity has always been desired in cancer therapy, and this has started to be realized with the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and signal transduction therapies. The former proteinaceous agents, unlike pharmacologically active 'small' molecules, utilize precise immunological targeting of cancer cells and are not considered here. The principle of signal transduction therapies is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1 . Signal transduction [16] involves the utilization of biochemically induced signals generated by a range of large and small molecules such as growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, chemokines and ATP into a wide variety of cell responses like cell division, metabolic changes, gene expression and cell death. Signal transduction therapy then depends on identifying signalling proteins and their altered pathways. The original employment of this approach for cancer therapy goes back to the use of tamoxifen as an oestrogen receptor antagonist in treating some forms of breast cancer that are dependent on oestrogen for their growth [135] .

Hypersensitivity to E. coli L-asparaginase up to 45 %. Erwinia enzyme used in patients allergic to E. coli enzyme tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors such as exemestane [136] and anastrozole that prevent the conversion of androgens to oestrogens and some hormone analogues (goserelin) [137] and anti-androgens (bicalutamide, flutamide) have been part of the targeted therapeutic approach to breast and prostate cancers [138] ( Table 3 ). The first signalling proteins to be utilized as targets for a new generation of unique anti-cancer drugs were protein kinases. The strategy adopted was based on the instability of the cancer genome compared to the normal cell. The Philadelphia translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) is a chromosomal defect resulting in gene fusion of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 (region q11) and ABL tyrosine kinase gene on chromosome 9 (region q34), producing the BCR-ABL oncogene. The Philadelphia chromosome abnormality is seen in 95 % of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and 15 to 30 % of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CML cells show absolute dependence ('oncogene addiction') on the kinase activity of protein Bcr-Abl [139] , and this dependence was first exploited by the development of the drug imatinib (Gleevec\u00ae) which inhibits the tyrosine kinase. In CML cases resistant to imatinib, broader spectrum tyrosine kinases such as dasatinib (Sprycel\u00ae) , which blocks both Bcr-Abl and Src tyrosine kinases, may be used [140] (Table 3) . Nilotinib is another protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting Bcr-Abl. Inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1; HER1; a member of the ErbB family of receptors), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) have also found use in the clinic as effective targeted anti-tumour drugs [96] . Some receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors include gefitinib and erlotinib (both inhibitors of EGFR), lapatinib (inhibits ErbB1 and ErbB2), vatalanib (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2), sorafenib (VEGFR, PDGFR and c-Kit) and sunitinib (VEGFR, PDGFR and c-Kit). Other targeting strategies summarized in Table 3 that interfere with signal transduction and which have entered, or are about to enter the clinic, include the more recently introduced mTOR serine/threonine kinase inhibitors that target the Raptor complex [141] (drug examples include everolimus and temsirolimus), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (e.g. romidepsin and vorinostat) that arrest the cell cycle [142] , targeting the PML-RAR \u03b1 oncoprotein (arsenic trioxide) [143] and drugs (e.g. bexarotene) binding to retinoid receptors [144] . Still other targeting strategies are represented by pralatrexate, a folate analogue that accumulates in cancer cells over-expressing protein RFC-1 [145] and the cytotoxic chimeric proteins denileukin diftitox [146] and ziv-aflibercept [147, 148] (Table 3) . Finally, proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib work against the cells of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphomas in perhaps the most fascinating of all the current targeted mechanisms [149, 150] . These drugs inhibit proteasomes by binding to proteolytic catalytic sites in the 20S proteasome core (Fig. 2 ).

From information obtained from the published medical/scientific literature, research studies and FDA and drug company data, Table 2 summarizes the most important systemic and cutaneous adverse reactions of the non-targeted anti-cancer drugs. With the exception of only one drug, lenalidomide which has multiple actions, the other drugs have been arranged in different categories based on common mechanisms of action. It has been claimed that the problem of hypersensitivity reactions to these chemotherapeutic drugs is often not reported by oncologists and therefore underestimated and that they can be divided into three groups with high, intermediate or low potential for causing hypersensitivity reactions [24] . Drugs included in the high group are platinum compounds, taxanes, epipodophyllotoxin topoisomerase II inhibitors, L -asparaginase and procarbazine. The anthracyclines (daunorubicin, doxorubicin and epirubicin), 6mercaptopurine and methotrexate are in the intermediate division while cytarabine, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide make up the low potential group. Antimetabolites such as capecitabine, gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil commonly provoke acral erythema syndrome ( Fig. 3 ) [153] , and in common with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, hyperpigmentation may occur. Mitotic inhibitors, the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids, often produce alopecia and nail abnormalities and radiation recall reactions are seen ( Table 2) . With some drugs such as the PARP inhibitors that are still in clinical trials, little information is available yet on adverse, let alone hypersensitivity, reactions ( Table 2 ). The inclusion of reactions to 16 kinase inhibiting drugs demonstrates the current importance of tyrosine and serine/ threonine kinase inhibitors for the targeted treatment of an expanding range of tumours (Table 3) . While the aim of signal transduction therapy is to kill the cancer cells with minimal collateral damage (Fig. 1) , even a quick glance at the catalogue of side effects in the table shows that, just as with the non-targeted drugs (but less so), cutaneous, gastrointestinal and haematopoietic cells are often still affected. Cytotoxic effects such as anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occur less often and usually with less severity than with, say, antimetabolites and alkylating agents, but a number of the compromised wound healing [131] agep acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, ALCL anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK anaplastic lymphoma kinase-an activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and appears to drive the malignant phenotype, APL acute myelocytic leukemia, ards acute (adult) respiratory distress syndrome, ATRA all transretinoic acid, CEL chronic eosinophilic leukemia, cls capillary leak syndrome, CTCL cutaneous T cell lymphoma, CV cardiovascular disorders, didf drug-induced disease flare (tumour flare effect), dress drug reaction (rash) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, EGFR epidermal growth factor receptor, EML4-ALK echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4, FGFR2 fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, GI gastrointestinal adverse events, GIST gastrointestinal stromal tumour, HCC hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatotox hepatotoxicity, HER2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (also known as Neu, ErB-2, CD340, p185), hfsr hand-foot skin reaction, hir hypersensitivity infusion reaction, Hsp90 heat shock protein 90, ild interstitial lung disease, leuko leukopenia, lympho lymphopenia, MCL mantle cell lymphoma, MCRC metastatic colorectal cancer, MM multiple myeloma, mpr maculopapular rash, MTC medullary thyroid cancer, neutro neutrocytopenia, p53 tumour protein 53, pah pulmonary arterial hypertension, PDGFR platelet-derived growth factor receptor, Ph+ Philadelphia chromosome-positive, pigm pigmentation changes, PML-RAR\u03b1 promyelocytic leukemia retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 oncogene fusion protein, PNET pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, pneum pneumonitis, PTCL peripheral T cell lymphoma, ppr papulopustular rash, RCC renal cell carcinoma, RET (rearranged during transfection) proto-oncogene on chromosome 10, RFC-1 reduced folate carrier type 1, rpcs relapsing polychondritis cutaneous symptoms, rpls reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, SEGA subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, sjs Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ssh subungual splinter haemorrhage, STS soft tissue sarcoma, ten toxic epidermal necrosis, thrombo thrombocytopenia, tls tumour lysis syndrome, VEGFR vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 Some drugs exert their action(s) by more than one mechanism and might therefore be classified into more than one category.

The situation where the mechanism of a drug-induced adverse response remains un-investigated or poorly understood is often seen in reactions to chemotherapy drugs where the haematological system, liver, lungs and skin are frequently affected (Tables 2 and 3 ). It has been said that so-called idiosyncratic drug reactions most often manifest as cutaneous reactions, haemato-and hepato-toxicities and less frequently as anaphylaxis and autoimmunity, but some investigators believe that most idiosyncratic reactions are hypersensitivities occurring via an immune-mediated response [156] . Cytotoxic chemotherapy typically suppresses haematopoiesis causing thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia, and drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a well-known cause of liver injury.

Symptoms of a drug-induced pseudo-allergic or anaphylactoid reaction resulting from the direct release of histamine and producing flushing, rash, pruritus, urticaria, hypotension and mucous secretion can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish these symptoms from a true, IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reaction. To do this, investigations designed to look for an immune basis of the reactions are necessary. Symptoms of drug-induced anaphylaxis generally include cardiovascular collapse, bronchospasm, urticaria, angioedema, erythema, [158, 159] . Symptoms are generally more severe in anaphylactic than in anaphylactoid reactions with cardiovascular collapse and bronchospasm occurring more frequently in the former and cutaneous manifestations seen more often in the latter [160] [161] [162] .

Such reactions remain rare but are seen more often with the platinum agents, L -asparaginase and methotrexate. Although there has been no clear and unequivocal demonstration of the existence of IgE antibodies to the platinum drugs, sensitizations only after multiple infusions, positive skin tests and anaphylactic-like reactions are all taken as evidence in support of a type I hypersensitivity mechanism with these agents [24] . This conclusion is supported by positive oxaliplatin [164, 165] and carboplatin [166] skin tests that show a sensitivity of 75 to 100 %. L -Asparaginase seems to be the drug with the highest risk of provoking a type I response with an allergic reaction occurring in up to 43 % and serious anaphylaxis in a little less than 10 % of treated patients. One study employing skin and Prausnitz-K\u00fcstner tests indicated an IgE-mediated mechanism in five anaphylactic patients [167] , whereas anaphylaxis to L -asparaginase in seven of eight cases was concluded to be due to complement activation induced by immune complexes of the drug with IgG and IgM antibodies [168] .

Although some reactions that resemble type I reactions are dismissed as not true immediate, IgE-mediated responses because they occurred on first exposure, it should be remembered that many such drug reactions do occur on first exposure, for example, to neuromuscular blockers, contrast media, proton pump inhibitors, quinolones and others [169, 170] .

Some haematopoietic cells, including platelets, can be affected by drug-induced type II hypersensitivity reactions. Immune-mediated, drug-dependent destruction of platelets may occur via a number of different mechanisms, including production of a new antigen after covalent binding of drug to platelet membrane glycoprotein, binding of drug to the platelet GPIIb/IIIa complex inducing a conformational change and a new antigenic determinant, noncovalent binding to platelet membrane glycoprotein forming a drug-glycoprotein complex that reacts with antibody, binding of the Fab fragment of the chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody abciximab to the platelet glycoprotein receptor GPIIb/IIIa followed by subsequent recognition by antibody, production of drug-induced autoantibody that reacts with the platelet surface glycoprotein and, lastly, reaction of heparins with platelet factor 4 producing an antibody-reactive antigen, immune complexes bound to the platelet Fc receptor and platelet activation [171, 172] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1463, "end": 1468, "text": "[171,", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 1469, "end": 1473, "text": "172]", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug-induced thrombocytopenia"}, {"text": "Data from 2000 to 2007 on 75,243 chemotherapy regimens of associated anaemia and thrombocytopenia contained in medical records of 47,159 US patients [173] with lung, breast, ovarian, head and neck or colorectal cancers treated with platinum-, anthracycline-, gemcitabine-or taxane-based regimens were assessed in an effort to determine the prevalence of thrombocytopenia in patients undergoing chemotherapy for solid tumours.

The time course of each is generally different, and this is a valuable diagnostic distinction.

Neutropenia is the most common adverse response induced by anti-cancer drugs, and neutropenia with fever is a major dose-limiting effect [184] of many of these drugs. Febrile neutropenia is generally defined as a rise in axillary temperature to more than 38.5\u00b0C for more than 1 h with a neutrophil count of <0.5\u00d710 9 /l. The lower limit of the absolute neutrophil count is generally taken as 1.5-1.8\u00d710 9 /l (1,500-1,800/\u03bcl). Mild, moderate and severe neutropenia are said to be present when the absolute neutrophil counts are 1,000-1,500, 500-1,000 and less than 500 cells/\u03bcl, respectively. Although the term granulocytopenia is often used synonymously with neutropenia, the term applies to blood granulocytes, namely neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Strictly therefore, agranulocytosis should refer to depletion of the granulocytes, but when used in relation to neutrophils, it generally refers to the virtual absence of neutrophils (<100 cells/\u03bcl) in the peripheral blood. The pathogenesis of DIN is poorly understood [185, 186] . Two main types of DIN are recognized: One is a dose-related, non-selective toxicity interfering with cell replication caused by, for example, antithyroid drugs, chloramphenicol, clozapine and cytotoxic antineoplastic drugs; the other is not dose-related, more often seen in women, older and allergic patients and is thought to be immunologic in origin being mediated by drug-dependent or drug-independent antibodies [187] . All patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy are at risk of neutropenic complications, but those with haematologic malignancies are at greater risk because of the particular disease processes and the usual intensity of the required treatments. The chemotherapy regimen is important in relation to the risk of neutropenia. Chemotherapy drugs well-known for their association with neutropenia include busulfan, carboplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, melphalan, methotrexate, paclitaxel and vinorelbine. Combined treatment with cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate is less toxic than cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin or combined cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin [188] . The risk of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is also related to the phase of therapy with the highest risk usually associated with the earliest cycles. For example, in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with docetaxel and doxorubicin, approximately 75 % of episodes of febrile neutropenia occurred during the first cycle of therapy [188] . Concurrent with the risk of neutropenia is the susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections that cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Such infections are commonly seen in the oral cavity and on mucous membranes presenting as pharyngitis, oral ulcers and periodontitis, sometimes together with stomatitis and mucositis. Infections of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, blood stream and especially the skin also occur. Again, detailed information on mechanisms underlying many cases of anti-neoplastic DIN, especially for the targeted drugs, is currently lacking, but as these therapies continue to be used, this information is likely to be accumulated slowly.

Mechanisms underlying most of these reactions remain to be determined. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs are the most common cause of stomatitis and mucositis. Although these terms are often used synonymously, stomatitis (oral mucositis) is restricted to the oral mucous membranes while mucositis affects the GI tract from mouth to anus. Approximately 40 % of patients receiving chemotherapy experience stomatitis. The most stomatotoxic agents include alkylating agents busulfan, chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide, antimetabolites cytarabine, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate, antibiotics bleomycin, actinomycin D, doxorubicin and mitomycin C, Vinca alkaloids and the taxanes [212] . Cytotoxic antineoplastic drugs destroy the rapidly dividing cells of the oral mucosa at a faster rate than most other normal healthy cells, but the detailed pathogenetic mechanism of stomatitis is still to be worked out. The pathogenesis of acral erythema (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia; hand-foot syndrome) [153] is not known, but it may be a direct cytotoxic effect. Some suggested mechanisms to explain the palms-soles location (Figs. 3 and 4) of reactions are based on vascular anatomy, temperature gradients, rapidly dividing epidermal cells and high concentration of eccrine glands [209] . Cutaneous eruptions of lymphocyte recovery is seen as a sharp, transient rise in temperature accompanied by macular and papular eruptions during the earliest recovery in peripheral lymphocyte numbers following chemotherapy for leukemia [213] . The observed rash is thought to indicate the return of immunocompetent lymphocytes to the circulation suggesting an immune pathogenesis. ESS is a benign cutaneous reaction not associated with any particular cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drug which manifests as erythematous macules, plaques or vesicles on the intertriginous areas of the palms and soles. The reaction is thought to be a direct cytotoxic effect of the drugs. Extravasation reactions occur when chemotherapeutic drugs are inadvertently allowed to contact the tissues during their IV administration. Reactions may be irritant or vesicant, the former appearing as phlebitis and an erythematous reaction along the vein or at the IV site; urticarial flare reactions exhibited by anthracyclines are an example. A well-known drug eliciting vesicant reactions (called chemical cellulitis) is the antibiotic mitomycin C. Several drugs, including suramin, cytarabine and 5-fluorouracil, provoke inflammation in preexisting skin reactions such as actinic keratoses. A suggested mechanism is increased DNA synthesis and uptake of drug by the affected tissues [214] . NEH [215] , associated with cytarabine, bleomycin, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, vincristine and a number of other cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs, appears as fever, oedema and skin eruptions such as erythematous macules, papules, plaques and pustules. Necrosis of eccrine epithelial cells together with neutrophils around eccrine sweat glands and ducts and the presence of drug in the sweat of patients suggest that direct toxicity of the sweat glands is the cause of NEH [216] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 532, "end": 537, "text": "[209,", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 538, "end": 542, "text": "211]", "ref_id": "BIBREF212"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1224, "text": "[212]", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 1539, "end": 1544, "text": "[153]", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1824, "text": "[209]", "ref_id": "BIBREF210"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2068, "text": "[213]", "ref_id": "BIBREF214"}, {"start": 3181, "end": 3186, "text": "[214]", "ref_id": "BIBREF215"}, {"start": 3193, "end": 3198, "text": "[215]", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 3674, "end": 3679, "text": "[216]", "ref_id": "BIBREF217"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1662, "end": 1677, "text": "(Figs. 3 and 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Some drug-induced cutaneous reactions"}, {"text": "Although modern targeted anti-cancer therapies such as tyrosine kinase and proteasome inhibitors have seen reductions in common systemic toxicities (e.g. nausea, vomiting, asthenia, diarrhoea etc.) and some of the more severe cutaneous and gastrointestinal effects occurring with some myelosuppressant drugs, it has become apparent that the targeted agents are responsible for multiple mild to moderate dermatological adverse effects (Table 3) [152, 155] . The most commonly reported effects are hand-foot skin reaction [151] (Fig. 4) (a distinct entity from hand-foot syndrome or acral erythema seen with cytotoxic drugs such as capecitabine (Fig. 3) , 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin [152] ), papulopustular rash (Fig. 5) , xerosis, fissures on fingertips and toes, pruritus, pigmentary changes and abnormalities of the mouth (stomatitis, mucositis), hair, scalp (alopecia), nails (e.g. paronychia) and on the eyelids (trichomegaly of the lashes). Some of the main features that can be used to distinguish the two hand-foot reactions relate to the type of lesion and their location on the hands and feet. The cytotoxic drugs cause diffuse and symmetric erythematous lesions with oedema and fissuring while in hand-foot skin reactions, tender, localized lesions appear as blisters and hyperkeratosis [152] . Lesions are seen on the palmar (ventral) surfaces of the hands following administration of both types of drugs. They are diffuse in the case of the cytotoxic agents but occur on the digit tips, over the interphalangeal joints and on the thenar area following the kinase inhibitors.

Hepatic injuries are said to account for 5.9 % of all ADRs, 14.7 % of lethal ADRs [218] and 13-17 % of acute liver failures. At least 1,000 registered drugs have been implicated in causing liver disease on more than one occasion. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) mimics all forms of acute and chronic liver Fig. 5 Small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib, gefitinib and sorafenib often provoke characteristic inflammatory papulopustular exanthemas described as acneiform or rosaceaform rashes. These are the most frequently seen cutaneous reactions to these drugs occurring in more than 90 % of patients in the first days-weeks of therapy [152, 154, 155] . The photographs show increasing degrees of severity of rashes based on a scoring system that takes into account colour and distribution of erythema, papulation, pustulation and scaling/crusts: a mild rash; b moderate rash; c severe rash (reproduced from Gerber et al. [154] , an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License) disease and is seen predominantly as hepatitis and/or cholestasis [217] . Most cases of DILI fall into three main clinical patterns: acute hepatocellular injury with jaundice similar to hepatitis and increased serum transaminase; acute cholestatic injury with jaundice, marked elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase and moderate increases in transaminases and a mixture of these two patterns showing elevations of both alkaline phosphatase and transaminases [217] . The mechanism of DILI can be divided into direct, sometimes called intrinsic, hepatotoxicity (as seen with, for example, paracetamol (acetaminophen)) and unpredictable and rare liver injury which in turn can be classified into immune-mediated hypersensitivity and idiosyncratic reactions [217, 219] . The latter reactions are only seen in susceptible individuals and may be due to idiosyncratic metabolism producing harmful metabolites. Allergic hepatitis is associated with fever and rash and when caused by drugs, as in for example, DRESS, the reaction is generally a type IV hypersensitivity response involving CD4+ cells, CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes and NK, Kupffer and dendritic cells. Type II hypersensitivities may also sometimes occur. There are currently two main hypotheses for the mechanism of immune-mediated DILI. In perhaps the most supported model, the drug or active metabolite(s) as hapten is said to bind to endogenous proteins forming immunogenic conjugates that generate antibody-and/or T cell-mediated injury. Another view is that most individuals are tolerant to immune injury of the liver and reactions occur only when tolerance is in some way overcome [220] [221] [222] . Knowledge of mechanisms underlying idiosyncratic DILI remains limited. Direct hepatotoxicity usually manifests as necrotic reactions with little inflammation while idiosyncratic reactions show injury with clear inflammation.

Progression to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis was reported in a hepatitis C patient given cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids [223] . In autoimmune hepatitis accompanied by hypersensitivity, rash, eosinophilia and arthralgia, long-term use of the tetracycline minocycline may lead to autoimmune hepatitis or hepatitis that mimics lupus-related hepatitis. The risk of methotrexate-induced liver toxicity is exacerbated by high dosage, existing liver disease and heavy alcohol use. The alkylating agent procarbazine, metabolised and activated in the liver, may cause granulomatous hepatitis. Methotrexate, 5fluorouracil, cisplatin and tamoxifen have been associated with macrovesicular steatosis while the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan has a direct effect in steatohepatitis. Such an effect, sometimes referred to as chemotherapy-associated steatohepatitis, has also been reported for oxaliplatin. Tamoxifen, oestrogen and diethylstilbestrol can lead to hepatic steatosis but rarely steatohepatitis.

Patients most likely to develop DILD are those receiving chemotherapy with up to about 10 % of such patients experiencing injury although the incidence for individual drugs is different. The anti-neoplastic drugs most commonly involved in DILD are bleomycin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and busulfan, but many chemically and mechanistically different anti-cancer agents demonstrate pulmonary toxicity including mitomycin C, chlorambucil, melphalan, 6mercaptopurine, cytarabine, gemcitabine, fludarabine, carmustine, lomustine, etoposide, the taxanes, irinotecan, procarbazine, vinblastine, zinostatin and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and gefitinib. In general, mechanisms involved in the drug-induced lung injuries have not been elucidated making it difficult to effect classifications on the basis of pathogenesis. Chemotherapeutic drugs can be grouped into four main divisions: those producing interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis, hypersensitivity reactions, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) [224] . Interstitial pneumonia and fibrosis, often provoked by bleomycin, is an inflammation of the lung interstitium and the most commonly occurring DILD. Other drugs involved include busulfan, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, methotrexate and paclitaxel [225] . DILD hypersensitivity reactions result from interaction of drug with the immune system. Signs of interstitial pneumonia with lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrating the interstitial space are seen. Immune-mediated damage to the lung in DILD may be due to drug-specific antibodies or, more usually, drugspecific T cells. Eosinophilic pneumonia showing eosinophils in the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid can be caused by almost any medication. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a combined types III and IV reaction in a Th1/Th17 response [226] . Reports of drug-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis are increasing particularly to antineoplastic drugs [226] . No single diagnostic test is sufficient for a diagnosis, rather a combination of careful history, imaging (e.g. high-resolution computed tomography (CT)), examination of BAL fluid (positive signs include lymphocytic alveolitis with an increase in CD8+ lymphocytes), serum drug-specific antibody tests, lung biopsy and perhaps inhalation challenge and the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT). Corticosteroids appear to hasten resolution of symptoms in both drug-induced hypersensitivity and eosinophilic pneumonia. In ARDS, inflammation of the lungs leads to impaired gas exchange and release of mediators causing further inflammation, hypoxia and ultimately organ failure. All trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and mitomycin C are examples of chemotherapeutic drugs causing ARDS. In BOOP, organized polypoid granulation inflammatory tissue is seen in the distal bronchiole airways, respiratory bronchioles, alveoli and alveolar ducts [227, 228] .

A follow-up study confirmed the association between a negative carboplatin skin test and absence of hypersensitivity, but the significance of a positive test remained less certain [238] . Positive test results were obtained more often in a group of 60 patients referred for reactions to carboplatin. Fifty-three patients were skin test-positive, one patient showed a delayed positive reaction, four responded with a hypersensitivity reaction during drug infusion and two proved positive after several more infusions [166] . In a more recent study, positive skin tests to carboplatin were obtained in 64 % of 58 patients, leading the authors to conclude that the test is not a reliable predictor of carboplatin hypersensitivity [239] . Skin test concentrations generally employed for carboplatin are 10 mg/ml in the SPT and 0.02 ml of 0.1 or 1 mg/ml in the IDT increasing in ten-fold concentration steps to a maximum of 10 mg/ml. For oxaliplatin, concentrations of 1-5 mg/ml have been used in the SPT and maximums of 0.1-5 mg/ml in the intradermal test [165, 240] . In summary, it has been claimed that skin tests are positive in more than 80 % of the platinum drug-treated patients tested, and when the skin test to platinum drugs is negative, the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction is reduced sevenfold or even eliminated [57] .

Detailed mechanistic studies of most cases of anti-neoplastic drug-induced HA are generally not routinely undertaken so it is possible that interesting and surprising findings may be revealed with some of the many drugs now employed, as the following example serves to illustrate. In a study of 300 CLL patients given fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab, 5.8 % developed HA but 82.4 % of these patients showed a negative direct antiglobulin test suggesting that the drug combination treatment led to antiglobulin test-negative autoimmune HA [245] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 529, "end": 534, "text": "[189]", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1952, "text": "[245]", "ref_id": "BIBREF247"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Drug-induced anaemia"}, {"text": "Diagnosis of DIV can be difficult since there are no clearly well-established clinical or laboratory markers that can distinguish the condition from other vasculitidis.

Accurate diagnosis of DILI, especially immunemediated DILI together with identification of the causative drug, remains difficult. Specific tests are not available and there are no relevant experimental models to confidently establish mechanisms and devise potential diagnostic procedures. Current assessment of DILI is therefore largely dependent on serum concentration of total bilirubin and tests for liver damage namely, measurements of serum alkaline phosphatase and liver transaminases alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.

High-resolution CT scanning, pulmonary function testing and bronchoscopy with BAL can be used along with the patient's history of drug exposure, histological evidence of lung damage and exclusion of other causes [224, 227] . In CT scans, interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis (e.g. caused by bleomycin) tend to involve the lower lung zones, hypersensitivity reactions may be seen as ground-glass opacities with centrilobular nodules, bilateral ground-glass opacities involving dependent lung regions may be seen in ARDS and peribronchial or subpleural areas of consolidation are seen in BOOP [224] .

Reactions to taxanes may be IgE antibody-mediated or due to direct mast cell/ basophil or complement activation. Corticosteroids and antihistamines are generally employed in premedication protocols. Patients given paclitaxel require IV H 1 (diphenhydramine 50 mg) and H 2 (cimetidine 300 mg, ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg) antagonists prior to infusion commencing and an oral steroid (dexamethasone 20 mg) 12 and 6 h prior to 1-, 3-and 24-h-long infusions.

Administering increasing amounts of drug in an incremental and stepwise manner can provide a safe and effective means of continuing vital therapy while avoiding, or largely preventing, the adverse reactions. For carboplatin hypersensitivity, Lee et al. [250] administered a cumulative dose of 38.935 mg of drug in 11, 15-min steps followed by a final infusion over 184.4 min administering 461.065 mg (92 %). The total final cumulative dose of 500 mg was given over a \u223c6-h period. In a rapid desensitization protocol for carboplatin, oxaliplatin, docetaxel and paclitaxel, Gastaminza et al. [240] employed five delivery stages in procedures lasting from 2 to 5 h with 89 % of the total dose delivered in 1 h in the last step. Once again, apart from data on the platins and taxanes, there is little pertinent information on desensitization for most other anti-cancer drugs. A successful desensitization protocol for the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib involved ten escalating doses starting with 0.05 mg following premedication with prednisone and promethazine [251] . Examples of desensitization to imatinib have also been reported. Successes were achieved with gradual dose escalation over 10 weeks and, in another case, over 5 days starting with a dose of 0.005 mg and building up to a total of 400 mg [252] . In a 4-h outpatient oral procedure beginning with a 10-ng dose of imatinib, the drug was administered in increasing dosage every 15 min to ten patients, only two of whom ultimately proved unable to continue therapy [253] . 9 The most insidious of all adverse consequences of targeted therapies: tumour adaptation, increased malignancy and the invasive metastatic switch Over the last 15 years, molecularly targeted approaches involving innovative anti-angiogenic strategies, particularly drugs inhibiting the VEGF-A pathway, for example, the mAb bevacizumab and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib [254] , have brought about a revolution in the treatment of cancer. However, it has become increasingly clear that the complexities of tumour-induced angiogenesis and our understanding of its many interrelated processes and opposing effects on tumour resistance, growth and metastasis [255, 256] have produced outcomes that are often disappointing and more modest than originally expected [257] . From studies in tumour-bearing mice, the realization that anti-angiogenic therapy that initially exerts an antitumour effect by inhibiting vascularization may also lead on to the opposing effects of enhanced tumour growth, invasiveness and distal metastasis has brought into focus the questions of how tumour resistance develops and how it can be overcome [257, 258] . A number of possible explanations have been advanced such as the involvement of pro-angiogenic cytokines and growth factors, e.g. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1; CXCL12), osteopontin [259] ; absence of VEGF or VEGFRs in metastatic tumours; tumours utilizing blood vessels in vascular-rich tissues; selection and growth of tumour cells resistant to hypoxia and a number of other suggestions [258, 260] . Tumour blood vessels are abnormal [261] , and poor oxygenation is a well-known feature of solid tumours leading to tumour invasiveness that is due, in part at least, to increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) [262] . Several studies have highlighted the importance of improving oxygenation of cancer cells by demonstrating differentiation, vascular normalization and reduced metastasization following pO 2 increases [263, 264] after promotion of the so-called invasive metastatic switch [265] in a hypoxic tumour environment [266, 267] . In findings that seem to offer one of the most promising early strategies to overcome the invasive and metastatic effects seen during resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs, the endogenous anti-angiogenic chemorepulsive protein semaphorin 3A normalized the vasculature and blocked tumour growth when re-expressed in mouse pancreatic neurocrine tumours and cervical carcinomas [268, 269] . HIF-1\u03b1 which regulates cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation is often associated with treatment failure [267] , and its expression in human tumours has been shown to correlate with metastasis [270] . Treatment of tumour-bearing mice with sunitinib and semaphorin 3A demonstrated a marked reduction in HIF-1\u03b1 levels that were previously elevated in animals treated with the anti-angiogenesis drug. Administration of semaphorin 3A together with sunitinib also reduced NF-\u03baB and counteracted sunitinib-induced activation of c-Met (Met tyrosine kinase receptor; hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor) and other signalling pathways active in hypoxia [269, 271] . NF-\u03baB activates HIF-1\u03b1 and cancer invasiveness and may have an important role in the development of resistance to anti-angiogenic resistance [272] . C-Met and its ligand, HGF (scatter factor) are upregulated in a number of different cancers where they contribute to angiogenesis and tumour growth and metastasis [273] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 418, "text": "[250]", "ref_id": "BIBREF252"}, {"start": 750, "end": 755, "text": "[240]", "ref_id": "BIBREF242"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1237, "text": "[251]", "ref_id": "BIBREF253"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1481, "text": "[252]", "ref_id": "BIBREF254"}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1704, "text": "[253]", "ref_id": "BIBREF255"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1708, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2108, "text": "[254]", "ref_id": "BIBREF256"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2393, "text": "[255,", "ref_id": "BIBREF257"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2398, "text": "256]", "ref_id": "BIBREF258"}, {"start": 2492, "end": 2497, "text": "[257]", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 2856, "end": 2861, "text": "[257,", "ref_id": "BIBREF259"}, {"start": 2862, "end": 2866, "text": "258]", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}, {"start": 3107, "end": 3112, "text": "[259]", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 3314, "end": 3319, "text": "[258,", "ref_id": "BIBREF260"}, {"start": 3320, "end": 3324, "text": "260]", "ref_id": "BIBREF262"}, {"start": 3361, "end": 3366, "text": "[261]", "ref_id": "BIBREF263"}, {"start": 3557, "end": 3562, "text": "[262]", "ref_id": "BIBREF264"}, {"start": 3764, "end": 3769, "text": "[263,", "ref_id": "BIBREF265"}, {"start": 3770, "end": 3774, "text": "264]", "ref_id": "BIBREF266"}, {"start": 3835, "end": 3840, "text": "[265]", "ref_id": "BIBREF267"}, {"start": 3873, "end": 3878, "text": "[266,", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 3879, "end": 3883, "text": "267]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 4259, "end": 4264, "text": "[268,", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 4265, "end": 4269, "text": "269]", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 4380, "end": 4385, "text": "[267]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 4468, "end": 4473, "text": "[270]", "ref_id": "BIBREF272"}, {"start": 4923, "end": 4928, "text": "[269,", "ref_id": "BIBREF271"}, {"start": 4929, "end": 4933, "text": "271]", "ref_id": "BIBREF273"}, {"start": 5077, "end": 5082, "text": "[272]", "ref_id": "BIBREF274"}, {"start": 5248, "end": 5253, "text": "[273]", "ref_id": "BIBREF275"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Premedication and desensitization for chemotherapy"}, {"text": "10 Combination therapies with targeted agents: adverse effects as a consequence of overcoming resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy As summarized above, resistance eventually develops to VEGF inhibition therapy with the occurrence of residual primary tumour growth and/or metastasis [256] . It seems that restoration of the vasculature is the forerunner of oxygenation of tumour tissue and vascular normalization is critical not only for overcoming resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy but also to achieve success with such therapy together with other chemotherapeutic agents. These findings have ramifications for future targeted therapeutic approaches with antiangiogenic agents and for consequent adverse events occurring in treated patients. HIF-1\u03b1 is overexpressed in many cancers and its role in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastasis is firmly established [266, 267] making the transcription factor a priority target for drug development [274, 275] . Topotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor that inhibits religation of DNA strand breaks (Table 2) , independently inhibits HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation in human cancer cells [276] while the related drug irinotecan ( Table 2 ) has already been employed in combination with bevacizumab to inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 in recurrent glioblastoma [277] . Other non-targeted chemotherapeutic drugs that inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor aminoflavone, the peptide antibiotic with anticancer activity echinomycin and anthracyclines such as doxorubicin [278] . Targeted drugs that inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 include HDAC and mTOR (everolimus and temsirolimus) inhibitors and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Table 3 ) [279] . The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin together with irinotecan proved active in a mouse model of human metastatic colon cancer. The drug combination produced a reduction in tumour volume together with cell death under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions indicating a cytotoxic effect mediated via HIF-1\u03b1 [280] . Inhibitors that target other pathways, particularly pathways to tumour invasiveness, are also being sought. One such pathway is the HGF/C-Met pathway where preclinical studies with inhibitors that block multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (including VEGF) and c-Met showed amplification of the effects of VEGFR blockade leading to reduced angiogenesis, increased apoptosis and reductions in tumour growth and metastasis [281] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 288, "text": "[256]", "ref_id": "BIBREF258"}, {"start": 868, "end": 873, "text": "[266,", "ref_id": "BIBREF268"}, {"start": 874, "end": 878, "text": "267]", "ref_id": "BIBREF269"}, {"start": 950, "end": 955, "text": "[274,", "ref_id": "BIBREF276"}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "275]", "ref_id": "BIBREF277"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1130, "text": "[276]", "ref_id": "BIBREF278"}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1284, "text": "[277]", "ref_id": "BIBREF279"}, {"start": 1500, "end": 1505, "text": "[278]", "ref_id": "BIBREF280"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1662, "text": "[279]", "ref_id": "BIBREF281"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1965, "text": "[280]", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 2387, "end": 2392, "text": "[281]", "ref_id": "BIBREF283"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1048, "end": 1057, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1174, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1646, "end": 1654, "text": "(Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Premedication and desensitization for chemotherapy"}, {"text": "For metastatic carcinoma, e.g. RCC, approved targeted therapies that have become available in recent years for firstand second-line use include sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib (Table 3) , the VEGF-targeted mAb bevacizumab and mTOR inhibitors everolimus and temsirolimus (Table 3 ). The main adverse events to bevacizumab comprise GI perforation, haemorrhage, wound healing complications, thrombosis, infusion reactions, hypertension, necrotizing fasciitis, proteinurea and pulmonary events [282] ; reactions to the other five drugs are summarized in Table 3 . Axitinib (Inlyta\u00ae) which inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including VEGFRs, PDGFR and c-KIT was approved by the FDA in January 2012 for patients with advanced RCC after failure of one prior systemic therapy.

In addition to the well-known adverse reactions to the drugs used for mono-anti-angiogenic treatment, for example sunitinib or sorafenib, the likely increasing use of combination therapies to overcome the severe adverse consequences of the resistance-promoting targeted anti-angiogenic therapies will see the appearance of adverse responses to cytotoxic, nontargeted drugs like topotecan, irinotecan and anthracyclines with their well-known myelosuppression, cytopenias and occasional type I (anaphylactic) and types II and III hypersensitivity reactions ( Table 2 ).

A recent announcement from the phase III CENTRIC trial which investigated the efficacy and tolerability of cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with methylated O (6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase gene promotor status revealed that the drug did not meet its primary endpoint of significantly increasing overall survival.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 193, "text": "(Zaltrap\u00ae)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 274, "end": 279, "text": "[286]", "ref_id": "BIBREF288"}, {"start": 332, "end": 337, "text": "[287]", "ref_id": "BIBREF289"}, {"start": 382, "end": 387, "text": "[288]", "ref_id": "BIBREF290"}, {"start": 522, "end": 527, "text": "[289]", "ref_id": "BIBREF291"}, {"start": 663, "end": 668, "text": "[290]", "ref_id": "BIBREF292"}, {"start": 987, "end": 992, "text": "[291]", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 229, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}, {"start": 845, "end": 852, "text": "(Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Premedication and desensitization for chemotherapy"}, {"text": "It is clear that many currently favoured strategies to elucidate mechanisms and find new and effective anti-cancer agents are leading to targeted 'multi-modal' therapies combining different anti-angiogenic, or anti-angiogenic together with cytotoxic, approaches [292] .

Towards multi-modal treatment strategies A consideration of the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions is a necessary part of clinical drug trials, and such reactions are commonly referred to in information released by drug regulatory agencies, drug package inserts, the oncology literature, some pharmacological investigations and toxicology studies. The term hypersensitivity is widely used across a number of disciplines, but it is clear that those using the term do not always have the same definition in mind. Even within its 'home' disciplines of immunology and allergy, there is inconsistency and confusion over both the definition of hypersensitivity and the assignment of the term, and this situation has not been helped by the WAO's so-called 'stringent definition' based, as claimed, on 'the mechanisms that initiate and mediate allergic reactions' without including any reference to allergic and/or immune involvement [7] . With such a definition, it is difficult to see how types I to IV hypersensitivity reactions, distinguished on the basis of humoral and cellular immune mediation, can be separated from a variety of other reactions showing 'objectively reproducible symptoms or signs' initiated by 'a defined stimulus at a dose tolerated by normal persons'. It is not surprising therefore to find that a drug reaction classified as a hypersensitivity response in the absence of any test investigations might be anything from an unsurprising collection of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms to a full-blown bullous skin eruption. Such inconsistent use of the term hypersensitivity is particularly apparent in the assessment and recording of adverse reactions to chemotherapeutic drugs. Patients sometimes show different and unexpected reactions to the same drug. The question of the possible participation of humoral or cellular immune mechanisms in anti-neoplastic drug-induced thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anaemia, vascular disorders, liver injury and lung disease as well as in the many dermatological manifestations is obviously fundamental in any attempted assessment of the incidence of true hypersensitivity responses to the increasing battery of drugs used in large numbers of patients for therapy of many different cancers. Even a quick perusal of Tables 2 and 3 reveals that adverse haematological, liver, lung and skin reactions occur across the multitude of chemically diverse drugs, many with vastly different modes of action, but it is frequently not at all clear whether a reaction is a true hypersensitivity response and if any immune process, direct or indirect, is involved. In a recent review of immune haemolytic anaemia associated with drug therapy, Garraty [293] summarized the current situation in words that apply as much to drug-induced reactions to platelets, neutrophils, the vasculature, liver, lung and cutaneous cells as to red cells: 'With increased knowledge of the immune system\u2026.it is a pity that more modern approaches have not been applied to solving the mechanism(s) involved in drug-induced RBC auto antibody formation'.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1008, "end": 1011, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2786, "text": "[293]", "ref_id": "BIBREF295"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2359, "end": 2373, "text": "Tables 2 and 3", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Premedication and desensitization for chemotherapy"}, {"text": "If widespread acceptance of what constitutes a hypersensitivity reaction is to be achieved, agreement on the definition of such reactions must occur and that will require the acceptance of uniform criteria for some common terminology. In the standard classification and severity grading scale in cancer therapy, clinical trials and other oncology settings published as Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events by the US National Institutes of Health and NCI under the US Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 'hypersensitivity' is grouped with 'allergic reaction' [234] , in itself indicating the acceptance of an immune basis for hypersensitivity responses. In recent years, progress has been made in elucidating mechanisms underlying a range of drug-induced cell-mediated type IV cutaneous eruptions (e.g. allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, erythema multiforme, AGEP, SJS, TEN) and systemic/ cutaneous reactions (e.g. DRESS) [210] , and together with our understanding of the mechanisms of types I, II and III hypersensitivities, it should be possible to present clear Fig. 6 Two-dimensional (a) and three-dimensional CPK space-filling models (b, c) of cilengitide, a cyclic pentapeptide with the structure cyclo(L-arginylglycyl-L-\u03b1-aspartyl-D-phenylalanine-N-methyl-L-valyl) (c(RGDf(NMe)V) containing the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-binding motif. Cilengitide is regarded as a promising drug for treatment of glioblastoma and several other tumours. In a and c, the three amino acids of the RGD motif are distinguished by the colours: orange , arginine; blue, glycine and green, aspartic acid. The remaining two amino acids making up the pentapeptide are shown in magenta (phenylalanine) and grey (N-methylated valine). The RGD sequence, the most prominent recognition motif involved in cell adhesion, is also found in fibronectin, fibrinogen, vitronectin and osteopontin each of which bind the pro-angiogenic \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin targeted for cancer therapy. Note that the cilengitide molecule contains the D -isomer of phenylalanine to force adaptation of a \u03b2II\u2032 turn in the synthesis of the cyclic peptide and one peptide bond (in the linkage with valine) has been N-methylated to increase the antagonistic activity of the molecule. The guanidino and carboxyl side chain groups of arginine and aspartic acid, respectively, which point in opposite directions may promote ionic interactions with the receptor [291] guidelines on the criteria necessary to identify a reaction as a true hypersensitivity response. In everyday practice, it will sometimes be difficult to clearly establish an immune basis for a reaction since, as outlined above, suitable tests necessary to define the mechanism of the reaction may not be available or easily accessible. Obtaining the necessary evidence to be sure of a hypersensitivity classification for a particular reaction may be especially difficult in some cases of suspected druginduced immune lung disease, liver injury and vascular disorders where work needs to be done to develop and apply suitable tests. Even for drug-induced thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, proving immune mediation of reactions will be difficult for some investigators, clinicians and facilities. However, despite the admittedly inadequate testing procedures available, it is likely that systematic application of the existing skin test approaches and in vitro assays could significantly improve the discrimination of many haematological, vascular, lung, liver and skin reactions and identify some true types I, II, III and IV drug hypersensitivities that may currently go unidentified because of the present widespread absence of any such testing. Existing assays and procedures for detecting drug-specific/reactive IgE and cytotoxic antibodies, drugantibody immune complexes and drug-reactive T cells need to be more frequently employed, but further research is needed to improve the range, specificity, ease of use and ready access of procedures for the identification of the four types of hypersensitivities to the many different anti-cancer drugs now so widely used. This area of oncoimmunology research has been neglected, not least by immunologists and allergists, to the detriment of patients, our recognition of the true nature and spectrum of side effects of many antineoplastic drugs and our understanding of some important and still poorly researched vascular, lung, liver and cutaneous drug-induced reactions. Clearly, the terminology used to describe hypersensitivity reactions needs to be standardised, but while the unsatisfactory lack of a common definition of what constitutes a hypersensitivity reaction and hence the resultant misuse of the term are particularly apparent in cancer chemotherapy, the same deficiencies, perhaps to a somewhat lesser extent, also exist in the allergy field. Greater involvement of both clinical and experimental allergists in the assessment of adverse drug responses to neoplastic agents in oncology would be of benefit to both disciplines and, importantly, lead to a more accurate interpretation of adverse events during clinical trials of cancer drugs. Adverse reactions that are serious enough to threaten further administration of drugs vital for therapy of particular cancers occur commonly and fatal outcomes may result in cases of drug withdrawal when this might have otherwise been prevented by skilled desensitization procedures. Given this, the potential value of skin testing in some cases and the need for premedication treatments and desensitizations, it is both surprising and unfortunate that allergists and clinical immunologists often seem to be so little involved in the management of adverse/hypersensitivity reactions in cancer chemotherapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 567, "end": 572, "text": "[234]", "ref_id": "BIBREF236"}, {"start": 935, "end": 940, "text": "[210]", "ref_id": "BIBREF211"}, {"start": 2403, "end": 2408, "text": "[291]", "ref_id": "BIBREF293"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1079, "end": 1085, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Premedication and desensitization for chemotherapy"}, {"text": "Finally, in relation to the immediate future of cancer chemotherapy, understanding the basis of the resistance that develops to VEGF inhibition therapy by, for example receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib and sunitinib, has brought with it the realization of the need to restore normal vasculature and oxygenation of tumour tissue.
