Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS-CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS-CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i \u0609 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination.

Reactions containing the MERS-CoV RdRp complex, primer/template, and various combinations of NTPs were initiated by the addition of Mg 2\u03e9 ions. In the presence [\u2423-32 P]GTP alone, the expected 5-mer product is formed. The addition of specific combinations of NTPs generated defined reaction products: [\u2423-32 P]GTP and ATP yielded a 7-mer ( Fig. 1D , left side of the gel) or a 6-mer product (Fig. 1D , right side of the gel), depending on the template sequence. Similarly, in the presence of [\u2423-32 P]GTP, ATP, and CTP (or UTP), the 4-mer primer is extended to yield an 11-or 7-mer depending on the template sequence.

Hence, we devised two different RNA templates that allow multiple and single incorporations, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2A .

For EBOV RdRp, we observed delayed chain termination at position i \u03e9 5 as previously described (Fig. 2B) (8) . However, the template that provides a single site of RDV-TP incorporation also shows reductions in full-length RNA synthesis. In contrast, the MERS RdRp complex yields the full-length RNA product with both sequences. The inhibition patterns with RDV-TP differ markedly from our results with EBOV RdRp. RNA synthesis is arrested at positions i \u03e9 3 and i \u03e9 4 with a template that provides multiple sites of incorporation of the inhibitor, and the full-length product is only seen as a faint band. The template that allows only a single incorporation event yields RNA synthesis arrest at position i \u03e9 3 and an increased amount of the full-length product. Hence, the mechanism of inhibition is likely delayed chain termination for both EBOV RdRp and MERS RdRp, although the specific patterns show subtle differences.
