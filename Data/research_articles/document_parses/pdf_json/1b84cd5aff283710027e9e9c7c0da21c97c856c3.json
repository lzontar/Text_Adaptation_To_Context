Using publicly available COVID-19 data for India upto 16th April 2020, we predict the true number of infections in India during and upto the end of active lockdown (21st April 2020) period. For successful prediction of the total infections, we require an estimate of the extent of cases escaping detection. An estimate of the infection fatality rate (ratio of total deaths to total infections) for the Indian population has been calculated recently (Bommer and Vollmer (2020) ). Assuming this rate to be constant, we determine estimates of the undetected infections for each day during the lockdown period. This time series data of undetected infections, along with recorded data for infected, recovered and deceased cases available from https://www.covid19india.org/, is used to fit a multivariate discrete time auto regressive (AR(1)) infection model.

Many sources are attributing the low infection rates to the low number of tests being conducted for a country with 1.38 billion population. Bommer and Vollmer (2020) assessed the Indian COVID-19 data and suggested that India is detecting only 1.68% of the total number of infections. While, Srinivas and James (2020) concludes a 3.6% detection rate with wide variation among the states. Their assessment of low detection rate is based on the fact that the Indian case fatality rate (CFR = total number of deaths divided by total detected infections) is poorly estimating the true infection fatality rate, due to a large number of undetected infections in India. Using a recent study by Verity et al. (2020) based on age stratified fatality data from mainland China and international Wuhan residents returning on repatriation flights, Bommer and Vollmer (2020) calculate an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.41% specifically for India. The IFR was calculated for India using population data from UN to correct for differences in age distributions in China and India. In our study we propose to use 0.41% as the first estimate of the IFR. We obtain a second estimate of the IFR for India from cumulative death and infections data for the state of Kerala. Kerala has been exceptionally successful in reducing the number of new infections. This is only possible through successful tracking and isolation of every COVID-19 infection in the state.

However, in the first week of the lockdown, the ratio ( At It ) became almost constant over time. This slowing down effect on the rise in the undetected cases may be assumed to be the immediate effect of lockdown. From second week of the lockdown, the ratio ( At It ) is noted to be decreasing with time. This leads to a further decrease in the number of undetected cases. This further decrease may be attributed to the additional effects of increased testing and active hotspot containment during the lockdown period. Thus, it seems from the data, that lockdown and increase in testing have lowered or slowed down the rate of rise in the number of undetected cases. However, one should note carefully the increasing A t /I t ratios prior to lockdown and consider the possible effect of increasing undetected cases before any relaxations of intervention measures.
