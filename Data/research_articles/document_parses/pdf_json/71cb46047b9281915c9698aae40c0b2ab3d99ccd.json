Lai et al. (2015) reported a comorbidity profile presenting a high level of GAD symptoms and a moderate level of PTSD, accounting for 37.17% in their sample. The current study further revealed the two subprofiles of comorbidity of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD, namely, Mild Comorbidity (23.38%) and Severe Comorbidity (12.11%). By contrast, the comorbidity rates of PTSD and GAD in children and adolescents who experienced a natural disaster was 42.78%, as determined via the variable-centered method (Marthoenis et al., 2019) . The rates of comorbid GAD determined via the variable-centered method in adult samples with diagnosed PTSD were 45.78% and 69.05% for the victims of serious motor vehicle accidents and intimate partner violence (Beck et al., 2015) . The differences between person-centered and variable-based statistical methods, between adult and juvenile samples, and between natural and non-natural disaster traumas may affect the analysis of the comorbidity rate. Therefore, further comparative studies should be carried out to explore specific factors affecting the comorbidity rate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 179, "text": "Lai et al.

In particular, Mild Comorbidity Profile includes respondents who reported severe intrusion symptoms but mild avoidance symptoms. This controversial result was also found in previous studies. McCall and Resick (2003) interviewed 20 Kalahari Bushmen (a radical non-Western culture, 10 male and 10 female) who were exposed to domestic violence. All the participants met multiple criteria for the diagnosis of intrusion symptoms, but only one to eight participants met several criteria for avoidance symptoms to varying degrees. Soysa (2013) compared PTSD symptoms among Sri Lankan (nonwestern culture) children who were exposed to war (30 male, 30 female; aged 9\u221216 years) and the 2004 tsunami (30 male, 30 female; aged 12\u221214 years). A total of 80% of the war subjects met the intrusion criteria, but only 23% met the avoidance criteria., A total of 85% tsunami subjects met the intrusion criteria, but only 23% met the avoidance criteria. These results may be related to culture. The diagnostic criteria for PTSD have been operationalized primarily in a Euro-American, Western, and industrialized contexts (Marsella et al., 1996) . Whether the diagnostic criteria for PTSD include culture-universal andspecific responses should be further explored (Hinton & Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2011 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 270, "end": 294, "text": "McCall and Resick (2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1206, "text": "(Marsella et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1356, "text": "(Hinton & Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "This work is a rapid and timely study that was conducted during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China. However, this work also has limitations. First, when the present study was designed, COVID-19 was only spreading in China. Therefore, the results should not be extended to a wider population. Given the panic and damage caused by the spread of COVID-19 worldwide, the situation became increasingly threatening. Similar studies from other countries and regions were expected to confirm our findings. Second, the symptoms for PTSD appeared after exposure to the trauma. However, as time goes by, the course of them changed. The duration of the symptoms for PTSD (ranging from 3 days to 1 month) is a response pattern of acute stress disorder, while the response pattern of PTSD cannot be diagnosed until it lasts more than 1 month (American Psychological Association, 2013) . The present data were collected 7-14 days after Wuhan declared a lockdown strategy. As the lockdown continued, negative psychological conditions (e.g., fear, depression, boredom, and anxiety) developed among individuals (Brooks et al., 2020) . Whether additional severe symptoms for PTSD developed as the psychosomatic condition changed should be further studied. Therefore, a longitudinal database will be established in the next 3-12 months to continue the corresponding research and investigate the occurrence, development, and underlying mechanism of PTSD.
