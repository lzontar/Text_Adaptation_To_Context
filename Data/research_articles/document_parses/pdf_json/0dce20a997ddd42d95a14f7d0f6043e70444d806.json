SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly through respiratory droplets with the risk of spread increasing with closer proximity to an infected person. Owing to both the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19, social distancing is a central cornerstone of disease management. Furthermore, COVID-19 has resulted in additional healthcare system constraints including a need to preserve personal protective equipment and conserve healthcare personnel for management of critically ill patients. All of these factors have worked in concert to dramatically limit the performance of non-emergent endoscopy and delivery of in-person clinical visits. While this has clearly impacted clinical activities, it has had an even greater impact on gastroenterology and endoscopy training. In this article, we present an assessment of the impact of COVID-19 upon GI trainees, highlight strategies to mitigate its impact on education and well-being, and ultimately return trainees to a \"new normal\" endoscopic and clinical practice.",

Due to the significant increase in hospital admissions of COVID-19 patients and the need to manage surge capacity, many clinicians -including trainees -have been deployed in units dedicated to the management of these patients; in fact, Repici et al found that a majority of Italian endoscopy units relocated endoscopists to other hospital departments 1 . Furthermore, due to the high virulence of SARS-CoV-2, emergent demand for stringent standards of infection control, and rationing of necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) 2 , the overall endoscopy volumes decreased dramatically with only a minority the units performing outpatient procedures. In order to further minimize risk, staffing was restricted to essential personnel, often excluding fellows from endoscopic procedures. Consistent with this, approximately half of North American endoscopy units reported that they completely eliminated trainee involvement in endoscopy during the pandemic 3 .",

While having gained some early momentum in pre-COVID days, the implementation of new teaching paradigms needs to be greatly accelerated. Successful transformation of training programs will require embracing a technology-driven future.

For example, the AGA has a specific web destination for fellows (\"GI Distance Learning\"; http://agau.gastro.org/diweb/catalog/q/GI-Distance-Learning/). In a similar fashion, the American College of Gastroenterology offers programs such as a weekly Virtual Grand Rounds (https://gi.org/education/acg-virtual-grand-rounds/) on topics such as celiac disease and C. difficile infection; and, on GI LEAP (https://learn.asge.org), the ASGE is hosting weekly interactive sessions (\"ASGE Endo Hangouts\") focused on trainee education led by world-class endoscopic experts. Of note, all programs are free to trainees allowing the fellows to take advantage of multiple activities. Local and regional GI societies are similarly addressing trainee member needs by offering new fellows' series and sharing virtual educational opportunities across institutions. Similarly, in Europe, many national societies have begun dedicated programs to keep fellows engaged on the topics of IBD, liver disease and transplant, endoscopy and general GI practice. Access to well-known international thought leaders is being offered through webinars and international collaborations to develop endoscopic online learning platforms for live endoscopy as well as on-demand videos are underway.",

This may also be an ideal time to initiate or complete research projects depending on the availability of existing data. Programs should encourage fellows to practice self-directed learning and tailor their time during this phase. While a first-year trainee can benefit from augmenting their knowledge in all topics cognitive and endoscopic, a graduating trainee would do best to reflect on areas of deficiency and adjust their schedule to areas in need. The impact on training may be hardest felt by those trainees undergoing advanced additional training in either endoscopy, IBD, esophageal diseases or hepatology. The successful ascent during this year of training requires a steep learning curve and is heavily dependent on the patient and procedure volume and intensity. In a recent North American survey conducted during the pandemic, nearly half of advanced endoscopy trainees were not participating in procedures and the overall therapeutic endoscopy volume had greatly decreased 3 . A month \"out\" of advanced training represents nearly 10% of the entire fellowship and thus supplementing the patient volume during the residual months will be critically important.",

While the \"ideal\" strategies are quite varied and will constantly evolve, there is some consensus that local disease prevalence, availability of personnel, access to PPE and testing, and monitoring for resurgence will be critical factors guiding implementation. There is universal recognition that the \"pause\" on elective patient care has created a tremendous backlog of deferred cases. As an example, given the annual endoscopic volume in the United States 8 and the duration of the pause, it is estimated that there will be over 3 million GI procedures that need to be performed in addition to the typical caseload. If outpatient gastroenterology and hepatology patients are included, these numbers become significantly higher. Thus, GI practices will need to balance atypically large case volumes while continuing to provide high quality training.
