Hemorrhage may be related to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), but the presence of hepatic damage may confuse the picture. DIC is a regular feature of Marburg and Crimean-Congo HF but less frequent with arena-virus infections (5,7). Shock occurs as a consequence of hypovolemia. Only limited observations have been made in patients in whom shock persists after volume resuscitation and these have been contradictory with both an increased and a decreased systemic vascular resistance reported in association with a reduced cardiac index (3, (8) (9) (10) .",

An epidemic was aborted in the latter case by eradication of the domestic bird population. Pneumonia is the most common complication, which occurs in high-risk patients including those with comorbid illness such as cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, diabetes, renal failure, immunosuppression, the elderly, or residents of nursing homes. The pneumonia may be primary (of viral origin) or secondary (related to bacterial infection). Primary viral pneumonia is the most severe, although the least common of the pneumonic complications and may occur in patients that are otherwise normal (22). Whereas secondary bacterial pneumonia has been reported to be the most frequent cause of death in previous pandemics (23), this was not the case in the most recent outbreak in Hong Kong (24). Where secondary bacterial pneumonia occurs, the most common pathogens are S. pneumoniae (48%). S. aureus (19%) and H. influenzae.

However, viruses account for between 30-60% of all cases of liver failure (46,47). Most of these are related to hepatitis B (HBV) and a relatively smaller proportion to A (HAV) or other newly identified viruses. Fulminant hepatic failure is defined either as acute liver disease, occurring in the absence of pre-existing liver disease, which leads to encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset of symptoms, or as liver disease, which leads to encephalopathy within 2 weeks of onset of jaundice (47). Clinical features are often non-specific, such as nausea and vomiting with progression to encephalopathy and coma. The prognosis is inversely proportional to the degree of encephalopathy.",

Hepatitis D is an incomplete RNA virus that requires the presence of hepatitis B virus in order to infect an individual. It is an important cause of fulminant hepatitis and aggressive chronic hepatitis in HBV carriers (48). Hepatitis E virus is an RNA virus transmitted by the fecal-oral route and possibly parenterally which for unknown reasons carries a high mortality from fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women and is also the commonest cause of fulminant hepatitis in India (49,50). Hepatitis C virus is an RNA virus of the flaviviridae family and is responsible for 20% of acute hepatitis, 70% of chronic hepatitis and 40% of end-stage cirrhosis in Europe. 80% of patients infected with hepatitis C develop chronic infection consisting of either chronic hepatitis, fibrosis or cirrhosis. It is also not usual for it to cause a fulminant hepatic failure (51) but this occurs only in areas with high hepatitis C serum prevalence (47).",

Seronegative patients receiving a seropositive organ transplant will develop a primary infection in 70-90% of cases (63,64). Seropositive patients will develop CMV infection by superinfection or reinfection in 60-100% of cases. Primary infection is the most likely type and is also usually more severe. Those who receive anti-thymocyte or antilymphocyte globulins and those who have bone marrow transplants also have more severe disease and a mortality of 75-90% (65,66) . CMV infection occurs most frequently 3-16 weeks after transplantation. Manifestations include, fever, hepatitis, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The most important condition resulting in admission to ICU is interstitial pneumonitis. This is associated with variable changes in the chest radiograph, most commonly showing diffuse bilateral infiltrates, but focal consolidation or nodules may occur. In the developing world CMV is more frequently seen in association with HIV. Despite the clear association with mortality in organ transplant recipients, in particular bone marrow transplants, the significance of CMV as a pathogen in patients with AIDS is unclear. Autopsy studies demonstrate that although CMV pneumonitis is frequently present it is not commonly found as the sole pathogen (67,68). In addition bronchoalveolar lavage specimens are also positive for CMV in more than 60% of patients (69). CMV has also been reported to be a potential cause of ventilator associated pneumonia in immunocompetent patients (70) and it is suggested that CMV should be considered as a possibility in patients not responding to antimicrobials or if there is evidence of other hospital outbreaks of viral infection particularly in the pediatric wards (71).",

SARS is highly contagious, specifically to health care workers and in particular where the index case is not immediately identified as having the disease. At the Prince of Wales Hospital, a patient was admitted on the 4/3/03 with \"pneumonia\" and was discharged well on the 11/3/03. On the 10/3/03 however, 18 health care workers became ill and a further 50 potential cases were identified on that day. By March 156 patients had been admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital with SARS, all traceable to this index patient (96). In Singapore similarly, initial transmission occurred from an index case to 12 patients, 10 of whom were primary contacts and 5 of whom were health care workers (97). In this latter case, Singaporean media labeled this patient a super-spreader, a concept that, although as yet inadequately defined may possibly be correct (98,99). Some patients do appear to spread the disease more readily and this may be related to the rate of shedding of viral particles. In Toronto amongst 144 cases 73 (51%) were health care workers and the subsequent outbreak of at least 90 patients occurred as a consequence of a cluster of unrecognized patients that had been admitted to North York Hospital in Toronto (90).",
