Detection of suicidal ideation is important in planning early psychiatric intervention and optimizing HIV/AIDS management. Characterization of suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults is crucial; however, practically there is no data in Indonesia, the country with the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. This study aims to identify suicidal ideation and analyze the associated psychopathology and determining factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults aged 18-65 years old receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Measurement using Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was performed to assess the existing psychopathology. Firth's penalized logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Results: A total of 86 subjects were recruited. Most subjects were male (65.1%), median age was 35 years, and median latest CD4 count was 463 cells/\u03bcl. Lifetime suicidal ideation was identified in 20 subjects (23.3%). Mean SCL-90 T-score for depressive and anxiety symptoms were both significantly higher among subjects with suicidal ideation (M = 60.75, SD = 12.0, p = 0.000 and M = 57.9, SD = 2.8, p = 0.001, respectively) compared to those without. Bivariate analyses showed that lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, non-marital status, CD4 count < 500 cells/\u03bcl, and efavirenz use. Multivariate analysis identified that a single-point increase in SCL-90 depression symptoms score (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 4.5-123.6, p = 0.000) and efavirenz use (AOR 5.00, 95% CI 1.02-24.6, p = 0.048) were significant independent factors related to suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Suicidal ideation is commonly found among Indonesian HIV-infected adults on ART. Depressive symptoms and efavirenz use are independent factors related to the presence of suicidal ideation. Thus, early screening of psychopathology as well as substitution of efavirenz with other ART regiment are recommended to prevent suicide and improve HIV/AIDS management outcome.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.

Phases of suicidal behavior can be divided into suicidal ideation, plans, and attempt [3, 4] . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines suicide as death caused by self-directed harmful behavior with an intention of dying as a result, while suicidal ideation is defined as having a thought of or considering suicide [3, 5, 6] .

All of these may lead to increased risk of psychopathology. Indeed, a 2018 study in UK showed that a higher proportion of PLHIV presented with depressive symptoms (27.0% versus 10.5%) and anxiety (21.6% versus 9.6%) compared to demographically-matched HIV-negative group [13, 14] . Almost double of those numbers were reported in Asian countries, such as China (50.8% of PLHIV showing depressive symptoms) and India (50% and 25-36% of PLHIV showing depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively) [15] [16] [17] . Prevalence in LMICs was similarly high, but resource limitation further added difficulties to the situation, due to underdiagnosis of mental disorders, suboptimal access to treatment, and limited research-based knowledge [18, 19] .

HIV positive status, together with socioeconomic burden, poor social support, and perceived stigma, were found to be predictive of suicide attempt in South Africa [21] . In high-income countries (HICs), socioeconomic factors are associated less strongly compared to the progression of HIV disease itself. In Switzerland, for example, lower cluster-of-differentiation-4-expressing T cells (CD4 T cells) and advanced HIV/ AIDS stage were related to higher suicide rate among PLHIV [24] . In particular, antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing efavirenz as a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), was linked to significant adverse effects on the CNS which may induce psychiatric symptoms, such as severe depression and suicidal ideation [25] . PLHIV receiving efavirenz were approximately twice as likely to experience suicidal thoughts or attempt suicide compared to those receiving other medications [26] . On the other hand, non-HIV-related risk factors did not vary between countries, which included female gender, young adult (18-34 years old), low educational level (secondary education or lower), married, and having a mental disorder [7] . While diagnosable mental disorders prior to suicidal behavior are more prevalent in HICs (> 90% versus 60%), psychopathologies are as predictive of suicidal ideation in LMICs as they are in HICs [2, 27, 28] . Ultimately, psychopathology in PLHIV was found to affect the clinical outcome and mortality, adherence to ART, HIV risk behaviors, and quality of life (QOL) poorly [11, 17, 29, 30] . Psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy and group psychotherapy) in HICs are effective in improving depressive symptoms among PLHIV, as evidently shown by clinical trials [31] [32] [33] .

Indeed, correlation of income with QOL has been robustly shown in both HICs and LMICs, affecting both mental health and peer perception, as well as stigma from the local community [64, 65] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 244, "end": 248, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 378, "end": 382, "text": "[21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 383, "end": 386, "text": "63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 784, "end": 788, "text": "[64,", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 789, "end": 792, "text": "65]", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Socio-environmental condition is heavily linked to mental health problems, including in PLHIV. Perception of solitude among PLHIV is significantly associated to depression and suicidal ideation as studied in several countries. For example, unmarried subjects had higher rate of depressive behavior in India [53] , and solitary living condition among PLHIV in Ethiopia increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation by 13.5 times [41] . In our study, unmarried subjects had significantly higher rate of suicidal ideation in bivariate analyses while the presence of cohabitants was non-associative. Non-marital status and presence of cohabitants, however, may not correlate with the actual presence of social support. Exclusion and the feeling of being isolated from surroundings might directly relate to depression and suicidal thoughts-37% of PLHIV experienced loneliness and social isolation due to their HIV seropositive status, which correlated with depressive symptoms [66] . In our study, CD4 cell count of < 500 cells/\u03bcL was not independently associated with lifetime suicidal ideation. This is contrary with result by Bitew et al., who reported CD4 count < 500 cells/\u03bcL as a predictive factor of suicidal thoughts with AOR of 2.5 [41] . Amanor-Boadu et al. went further and defined CD4 count as a clinical marker of untreated depression in African-American PLHIV [67] . In progressive HIV disease, low CD4 count was associated with AIDS defining illness and increasing mortality, while untreated depression and poor ART adherence were independently associated with poorer CD4 outcomes [63] . Discrepancy in result might be due to the smaller sample size in our study compared to the aforementioned studies. Also in contrast to our study, Bitew et al. stated strong correlation between opportunistic infections, depression, and suicidal ideation [41] . Risk of suicide may increase due to severe physical conditions such as muscle wasting, or direct pathogenesis to the CNS via opportunistic infections or HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), or vice versa-depression is also predictive of frailty phenotype and HAND [41, [68] [69] [70] . Opportunistic infections tend to be more severe as CD4 count decrease below 200 cells/\u03bcL; however, infections do not always occur in low CD4 state. Decline in immune status itself may negatively affect mental state and induce psychological frailty, rather than actual opportunistic infections to the CNS or other organ systems [12, 70] . In our study, most subjects already received ART for years which presumably led to relatively high median CD4 count and low occurrence of opportunistic infections. Recruitment of newly-diagnosed or untreated patients may further shed light on the correlation between suicidal behavior, immune dysfunction, and AIDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 307, "end": 311, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 428, "end": 432, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 972, "end": 976, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1240, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1373, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1595, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2136, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2141, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 2142, "end": 2146, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 2147, "end": 2151, "text": "[70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 2481, "end": 2485, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2486, "end": 2489, "text": "70]", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Regression model confirmed that the use of efavirenzbased ART regiment is associated to suicidal ideation in this study, with AOR of 5.00. Use of efavirenz has long been associated with CNS-related adverse effects including but not limited to dizziness, fatigue, nightmares, and insomnia [71, 72] . Specifically, long-term efavirenz use is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and suicidal ideation lasting for several months [72, 73] . In 2015, Mothapo et al. reported that efavirenz discontinuation improved depressive symptoms as measured by SCL-90 [74] . Studies in animal models showed that efavirenz evidently disrupted brain mitochondrial P450 systems and neurochemical balance, particularly serotonin, both of which led to its neurotoxic effects [75, 76] . Yet, the link to depressive behavior remains controversial. Study by Mollan et al. concluded that efavirenz was associated with 2-fold increased risk of suicidality [26] , while a newer study by Dabaghzadeh et al. in 2015 did not found any correlation [77] and Chang et al. in 2018 reported that suicidal thoughts did not occur more frequently in efavirenz recipients compared to another commonly used NNRTI, nevirapine [78] . The author opined that efavirenz is metabolically processed slower, resulting in lower peak levels and less CNS toxicity [78] while long duration of use is also known to induce tolerance towards CNS-related adverse effects [79] .

However, Olley et al. stated that patients who were diagnosed early with HIV might experience reduced stress over time after a period of adaptation [80] . Furthermore, study by Amiya et al. in Nepal added that stress associated with suicidal ideation arises early after HIV diagnosis due to inadaptation and absence of effective coping mechanism towards HIV seropositive status, which palliates over time [81] . Govender and Schlebusch also reported significant association between depression and feelings of hopelessness with HIV diagnosis of less than 6 weeks in South Africa [50] .

Lifetime instead of point prevalence was assessed, which only predicted the presence of suicidal ideation rather than its emergence. In addition, the ascertainment of suicidal ideation was done with a single question instead of a validated scale. Further study about characterization of suicidal attempt should be performed, which may enable an analysis of progression from ideation to realization. We also hope that further studies in LMIC could examine the implications specifically for women with HIV (e.g. [61] ), and PLHIV with shorter duration of diagnosis and therapy.
