Staged repair may be associated with a higher risk of inter-stage mortality, while primary repair may lead to frequent post-repair re-interventions. Methods From 2004 to 2017, 65 patients with PA/VSD who underwent surgical intervention before 90 days of age were identified and enrolled in this retrospective study. The cohort was divided into two groups: group-SR, who underwent initial palliation with staged repair (n = 50), and group-PR who underwent primary repair (n = 15). Results There were three post-palliation in-hospital mortalities, four inter-stage mortalities, and one post-repair in-hospital mortality in group-SR. In group-PR, there was one in-hospital death and one late death. Five-year survival rates were comparable between the two groups (group-SR: 83.6%; group-PR: 86.7%; p = 0.754). During the median follow-up duration of 44.7 months (Inter-quartile range, 19-109 months), 40 post-repair re-interventions (22 in group-SR, 18 in group-PR) were performed in 26 patients (18 in group-SR, 8 in group-PR). On Cox proportional hazards model, primary repair was identified as the only risk factor for decreased time to death/1st post-repair re-intervention (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.3, p = 0.049) and death/2nd post-repair re-intervention (HR 2.91, p = 0.033). Conclusions A staged repair strategy, compared with primary repair, was associated with comparable overall survival with less frequent re-interventions after repair in young infants with PA/VSD.

In patients with PA/VSD, initial post-natal palliation with staged repair is more frequently practiced than performing an early primary repair.

Parents of neonates discharged after a shunt operation are thoroughly educated about the symptoms and signs that may signify the development of shunt failure, and are given a 24-h hotline number for appropriate counseling provided by clinical nurse specialists. Frequent outpatient clinic visits are suggested so that the appropriate anticoagulation regimens can be given to rapidly growing babies who may outgrow the usual dose of anticoagulation. In 2006, we increased the daily dosage of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for patients with MBT from 5 mg/ kg-10 mg/kg, to effectively prevent thrombotic occlusion of the shunt, and also to prevent the under-dosage of ASA by the outgrowth of the patient [20] . In patients who received MBT using small (i.e., 3 mm or 3.5 mm) PTFE grafts, we attempt to minimize the inter-stage period by setting the timing of total correction within 6 months after birth, a point by which the risk of developing of inter-stage adverse outcomes is still low while a sizable RV-PA conduit can be implanted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 184, "end": 188, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 189, "end": 192, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 193, "end": 196, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 262, "end": 266, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 267, "end": 271, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 272, "end": 276, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 977, "end": 981, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 21, "end": 27, "text": "Fig. 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another surgical issue is the presence of juxtaductal stenosis (JDS), which should be considered in the management of PAVSD [21] . Stenosis of the left pulmonary artery by ductal tissue remnants outgrowth is a well-known, common cause of re-intervention for the branch pulmonary arteries in patients with ToF [22] . Increased risks of pulmonary arterial re-interventions in group-PR from this study may also be attributable to the surgical manipulation directly on the ductal tissue that took place at primary repair. Thus, when staged repair strategies for patients with PA/VSD and JDS is contemplated, a surgical protocol of placing systemicto-pulmonary arterial shunts at our institution is placing MBT shunt on the opposite side to the JDS. This is because performing aggressive pulmonary artery angioplasty for JDS by manipulating a thin and fragile pulmonary artery with abundant ductal tissue may jeopardize the integrity of the pulmonary arterial structure later on. We trust that MBT performed contralaterally to the JSD leads to a clear demarcation of the normal pulmonary arterial tissue after the spontaneous closure of the ductus, which may be helpful for the determination of further management of the branch pulmonary artery ipsilateral to the JDS. Mild JDS with a sizable ipsilateral hilar pulmonary artery can be easily managed at repair, and severe JDS with a hypoplastic ipsilateral hilar pulmonary artery can be managed by placing an additional MBT shunt.
