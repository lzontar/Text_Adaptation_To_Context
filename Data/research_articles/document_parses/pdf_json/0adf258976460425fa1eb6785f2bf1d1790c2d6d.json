We describe a patient, 60-year old Korean woman, with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who had been taking hydroxychloroquine for 6 months. Her serum and saliva concentrations of hydroxychloroquine were 280 \u00b5g/L and 4,890 \u00b5g/L, respectively. The present case raises concerns on hydroxychloroquine's role as a prophylactic agent for COVID-19.",

Although there was an anecdotal report of successful use of hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure prophylaxis, 3 a few COVID-19 cases during hydroxychloroquine use have been reported. 4 Recently, a randomized controlled trial failed to show the post-exposure prophylactic efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. 5 We describe an additional breakthrough case of COVID-19 during prolonged use of hydroxychloroquine due to her underlying disease. In addition, we measured her serum and saliva concentrations of hydroxychloroquine to further discuss its prophylactic effect.",
