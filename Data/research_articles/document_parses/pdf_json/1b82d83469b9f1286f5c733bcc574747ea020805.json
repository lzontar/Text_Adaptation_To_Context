Methods The outcome of 137 patients who underwent OLT using donors after cardiac death (DCDs) for CSHB in our center was reviewed retrospectively. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method; the logrank test was used for univariate analysis; and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for prognostic factors screening. Results The overall mortality rate was 33.6% (46/137); and 1-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year patient survival rates were 75.8, 72.0, 71.0, and 60.1%, respectively.

For example, the potential bias and subjectivity in retrospectively determining individual CTP scores, primarily with respect to the degree of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy [20] . However, the MELD score seemed to be more preferable in our current study. First, MELD gives a continuous liver disease severity score that can be easily applied to rank patients on the waiting list according to their risk of dying over a defined period of time. It also ranks patients more specifically according to the severity of their disease [3] . In our study, the patients with a MELD score C 33.8 had significantly lower shortterm (1-month and 6-month) survival rates than did patients with a CTP score C 12.5, which indicated that a high MELD score had a more compacted correlation with early death after OLT [6, 21] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 540, "end": 544, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 894, "end": 897, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1168, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1172, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Many studies have verified hepatic encephalopathy, serum creatinine, and preoperative infection as independent factors that influence the mortality of patients with severe hepatitis [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Considering that most patients died of MOF in our study due to sepsis caused by a preoperative pulmonary infection or spontaneous peritonitis or respiratory failure caused by ARDS, the peroperative management against infection should be enhanced. Our results also differed from several other studies that found advanced recipient age [26] [27] [28] , serum sodium level [18] , and bilirubin level [27] [28] [29] to be significant predictors of mortality after OLT. The limited sample of patients and possible selection bias are the most likely explanations for these differences. More recently, de Vera et al. [30] concluded that compared to brain death donors similar patient survival can be achieved with DCDs under favorable conditions, including donor age B 60 years, DWIT B 15 minutes, and CIT B 8 hours. In their study, primary nonfunction/delayed graft function (PNF/DGF) and BC cumulatively accounted for 67% of early graft failures, and recurrent disease (30%) and BC (20%) mainly caused late ([ 1 year after OLT) graft failure. However, the incidence of BC in our study was significantly lower than that of theirs (14.6% vs. 25%), and it caused only 13% (6/46) graft loss during the early stage after OLT. This was probably due to the fact that most DCDs in our study enjoyed shorter DWIT and CIT, which were considered to be the risk factors for BC and graft failure [30] [31] [32] . However, the lack of a standard definition of the DWIT has been problematic [33] , making studies that utilize UNOS data difficult to interpret, confounding comparisons of individual DCD studies, and preventing valid recommendations of a DWIT ceiling above which would predict poor outcomes. Our definition of DWIT was unambiguous-from the time of cardiac arrest of the donor to perfusion of the abdominal aorta. We did not use a blood pressure threshold below which would define the beginning of the DWIT as others have [34, 35] , as tissues are still hypoxic in DCDs who maintain a blood pressure but cease to ventilate. However, further reducing both DWIT and CITas well as possibly reducing the donor age might improve results [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 186, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 187, "end": 191, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 192, "end": 196, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 197, "end": 201, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 202, "end": 206, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 543, "end": 547, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 548, "end": 552, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 553, "end": 557, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 579, "end": 583, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 606, "end": 610, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 611, "end": 615, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 616, "end": 620, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 819, "end": 823, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1587, "end": 1591, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1596, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1597, "end": 1601, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1684, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2125, "end": 2129, "text": "[34,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2133, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2335, "end": 2339, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition, Tojimbara et al.

A clinical study [37] indicated that high-viscosity preservation solutions cause an increased incidence of biliary strictures compared with low-viscosity solutions. This is probably caused by inadequate clearance of the small peribiliary capillaries, a phenomenon to which liver grafts from NHBDs may be particularly vulnerable because of the stagnation of blood during warm ischemia [38] . Therefore, the main usage of low-viscosity modified HC-A solution and the common bile duct infusion with cold normal saline for DCDs in our study probably contributed to the low incidence of BC.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 30, "end": 34, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 255, "end": 259, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 622, "end": 626, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Nearly three-fourths of the patients with CSHB died during the first month after OLT, which was mainly caused by MOF.
