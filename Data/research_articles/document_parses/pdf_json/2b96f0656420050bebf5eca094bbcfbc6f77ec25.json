In a retrospective review from Wuhan, China, 26% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 required ICU admission due to ARDS [2] . Twelve percent of patients in the New York City area admitted for COVID-19 needed endotracheal intubation, and mortality for those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation reached as high as 88.1% [3] . While there have been significant data on the mortality of patients requiring mechanical ventilation no previous case reports have detailed the clinical timeline of respiratory recovery in those requiring tracheostomy placement.",

            "text": "A 56-year-old male with obesity, hypertension, and scoliosis presented to the hospital for dull, atypical chest pain. He was febrile to 38.0 degrees Celsius and had a new oxygen requirement of two liters on nasal cannula for a blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 96%. His HEART score was four [4] . His initial D-dimer was 790 ng/mL, and his initial troponin in the ED was 0.077 ng/mL (normal less than 0.015 ng/mL), without evidence of dynamic changes on electrocardiogram (EKG). A respiratory viral panel was negative. CT angiography scan showed no signs of pulmonary embolism, and chest X-ray demonstrated normal lung findings without definitive acute infiltrates ( Figure 1 ). The patient was admitted for hypoxia and acute coronary syndrome rule out. Repeat troponin level at six hours after admission decreased to 0.06 ng/mL. Given the patient's new hypoxia and chest pain, a COVID-19 nasal swab was collected. On hospital day three, bilateral crackles on exam were presumed to be pulmonary edema, and he was diuresed with IV furosemide. However, diuresis was discontinued due to a subsequent acute kidney injury. On hospital day four, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) resulted positive, and the patient was started on a 10-day course of hydroxychloroquine. On hospital day five, the patient had worsening tachypnea and SpO2 was 78% despite six liters oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient consented for invasive mechanical ventilation. Immediately following endotracheal intubation, arterial blood gas demonstrated a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio) of 77. Repeat chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates consistent with severe ARDS (Figure 2 ). Over the next two days, the patient was placed in the prone position for 18 hours a day and was intermittently paralyzed with cisatracurium. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was initiated at 20 cmH 2 O with 6 mL/kg low tidal volume ventilation. Plateau pressures remained below 30 cmH 2 0 with at this 2020 The patient continued to require mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube for the next 27 days. After the two days of intermittent prone positioning, oxygen saturation improved gradually over 14 days. The P/F ratio stabilized at greater than 200 on a PEEP of 5-7 cmH 2 O with FiO 2 at 40%. Despite improvement in respiratory status, impaired mental status precluded extubation for several weeks. On hospital day 32, he was extubated to nonrebreather mask with 10 L oxygen supplementation.",

Here we report a 58-day hospitalization requiring 52 days in the ICU due to continued need for mechanical ventilation. It is also noteworthy that the patient continued to test positive for COVID-19 until 37 days after admission. Prior research suggests that viral shedding after symptom onset gradually decreases toward undetectable levels around day 21, which is significantly shorter than what we report [6] . While this case may demonstrate an outlier regarding time to negative COVID-19 testing in a patient with severe ARDS, some patients may still be infectious beyond the typical three-week period.

Prior research in patients with pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation suggests that tracheostomy placement within seven days of endotracheal intubation is associated with improved mortality, shorter ICU stays, and fewer days of mechanical ventilation compared tracheostomy placement between 14 and 21 days [7] [8] . In this case, tracheostomy placement was delayed due to persistently positive COVID-19 PCR coupled with the possibility of successful extubation given the patient's improving respiratory status. In order to improve individual patient outcomes, and to better optimize ICU capacity during this pandemic, earlier tracheostomy placement could be considered. However, the benefits of early tracheostomy need to be balanced with the risk of aerosol-generating procedures and healthcare worker risk of infection [9] .",
