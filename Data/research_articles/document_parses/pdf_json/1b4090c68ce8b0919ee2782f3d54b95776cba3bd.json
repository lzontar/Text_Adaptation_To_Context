SARS-CoV-2 has many similarities with SARS-CoV. Both viruses rely on a protease called the main protease, or M pro , for replication. Therefore, inhibiting M pro may be a successful strategy for treating COVID-19. Structures are available in the Protein Data Bank of the main proteases of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with and without inhibitor N3. Comparing these structures revealed residue interaction network changes associated with N3 inhibition. Comparing network clustering with and without inhibitor N3 identified the formation of a cluster of residues 17, 18, 30-33, 70, 95, 98, 103, 117, 122, and 177 as a network change in both viral proteases when bound to inhibitor N3. Betweenness and stress centrality differences as well as differences in bond energies and relative B-factors when comparing free M pro to inhibitor-bound M pro identified residues 131, 175, 182, and 185 as possibly conformationally relevant when bound to the inhibitor N3.

The covalent bond that N3 forms with M pro blocks the active site, preventing further catalysis. N3 has been shown to irreversibly bind to the active site of the M pro (Jin et al., 2020) . Since M pro structures for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are available in the free and N3 inhibitor-bound states, it is possible to compare the structures to find differences in the active versus inhibitor-bound forms.

Temperatures of crystallization were close, ranging from 291K to 293K. Researchers who submitted the structures performed all experiments at 100K. It is known that M pro is sensitive to pH changes (Tan et al., 2005) , but it is unclear if the small pH difference in the crystallization conditions of the proteins included in this study could alter the RIN metrics or three-dimensional structures in biologically significant ways. Some researchers have observed that pH 6.0 leads to structures that are not as active as at neutral pH (Hilgenfeld, 2014) , so the relevance of analyses of these structures to physiological enzymatic function is not entirely clear. Finally, while there is a body of literature on the usefulness of structural applications of RINs, more research needs to be done to determine the extent of the usefulness of these methods.
