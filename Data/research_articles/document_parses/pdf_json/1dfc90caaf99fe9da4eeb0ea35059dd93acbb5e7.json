Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in up to 9 % of pregnant woman and can lead to a symptomatic urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis in 30-40 % of patients if left untreated [2] . Cystitis and pyelonephritis can occur in up to 2 % of pregnancies [3] . Because of the increased risk of UTI in pregnancy, the higher likelihood of progression to upper tract disease, and association with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and low birth weight infants, screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and appropriate treatment and management of cystitis and pyelonephritis are important for both mother and baby [4] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 395, "end": 398, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 577, "end": 580, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 649, "end": 652, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1075, "end": 1078, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) has published guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults [2] .

However, in clinical practice one midstream, clean catch specimen with the above criteria would be considered positive and should be treated in the pregnant patient. Because of an increased risk of complications, the IDSA recommends routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria at least once in early pregnancy with a urine culture and treatment if results are positive. This recommendation is based on the increased risk of progression to a symptomatic urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis in 30-40 % of patients. In addition, it is known that antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is associated with a significant decreased risk of both pyelonephritis and the frequency of low birth weight infants and preterm delivery [5] [6] [7] . The exact timing of screening does vary based on organization. The IDSA recommends a urine culture in \"early pregnancy.\" The US Preventative Services Task Force and The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommend screening with a urine culture between 12 and 16 weeks of gestation or at the first prenatal visit [8] .

Binding sites are found on erythrocytes, but also synovium, placental tissue, fetal myocardium, and endothelial cells. Severe anemia in the fetus can lead to highoutput heart failure and hydrops fetalis as seen by ascites, cardiomegaly, and pericardial effusion on ultrasound exam [43] . Fortunately, this does not occur as often as initially thought. Gratac\u00f3s et al. prospectively studied 1610 pregnant women in Spain who were <28 weeks pregnant at enrollment.

The remaining pregnancies were uneventful, and the 1-year follow-up of infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy showed no serious abnormalities [44] . Similar findings were shown by Enders et al. in another large prospective observational study of 1018 women infected with parvovirus during pregnancy. The observed rate of fetal death was 6.3 %, and death was only observed when B19 infection occurred during the first 20 weeks of gestation. There were six stillbirths, four of which were attributed to B19 infection within the first 20 weeks.

They found that maternal exposure to Lyme disease before conception or during pregnancy was not associated with fetal death, congenital malformations, or prematurity [59] . This same author also found no association between congenital heart defect and maternal tick bite or maternal Lyme disease within 3 months of conception or during pregnancy in a retrospective case-control study [61] .

In cases where parental therapy is preferred such as neurologic abnormalities, and some cardiac conditions including high-degree AV block, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice in nonpregnant and pregnant patients alike. It is important to know that Ixodes ticks can be co-infected and transmit Lyme in addition to other pathogens such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia spp. If symptoms are not compatible with Lyme disease after a tick bite or symptoms fail to resolve after appropriate antibiotic therapy, these co-infections should be considered [62] .

In this case, a tick bite was not recognized, but if it had been, prophylaxis would not be recommended. This is because of risks of doxycycline in pregnancy, in combination with the lack of data to support short courses of amoxicillin as a prophylactic regimen, and the excellent efficacy of antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease if infection does develop [50] . Since prophylaxis in pregnancy is not a recommended prevention of Lyme disease with avoidance of possible exposure, the use of tick repellents, such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), and early removal of ticks remain important tools to reduce infection rates [63] .

Burgdorferi was reported by Shirts et al. in a 27-year-old woman who presented with fever in the third trimester. The infant was delivered at 34 weeks via cesarean section for non-reassuring fetal status and the mother received cefamandole. Infant complications included hyperbilirubinemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and rash. A Borrelia-like spirochete was seen on peripheral blood smear from the infant and in the lumen of the placental cord vessels. The infant did well following ampicillin treatment[56]. Schlesinger et al. later reported another case of transplacental transmission of B. burgdorferi in a woman who developed an EM rash in her first trimester but was not treated. The infant born at 35 weeks died within 2 days of birth and was found to have multiple cardiac defects. Postmortem examination did reveal spirochetes in multiple organ systems in the infant[55].Whether transplacental transmission of B. burgdorferi actually increases the risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome is unclear. The individual case reports of cardiac malformations, stillbirth, cerebral edema, and rash have suggested a possible association between Lyme disease in pregnancy and neonatal harm[53,55,57].
