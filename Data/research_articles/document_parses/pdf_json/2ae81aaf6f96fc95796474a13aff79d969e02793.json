Deng et al. troponin levels were increased particularly in patients who died during hospitalization although they did not present with typical signs of myocarditis [2] . To face the emergency, most hospitals underwent a sudden, yet radical, transformation: all deferrable surgical and interventional procedures were delayed, the number of ICUs capacity was exponentially increased, and most departments (including coronary care units) were converted to COVID-19 units. 40 On March 8 th , the decree of the healthcare Authorities of Lombardy [5] urged a change in all the regional networks for the treatment of time-dependent clinical and surgical emergencies (STEMI, stroke, major traumas, neurological, cardiac and vascular surgical emergencies) to concentrate personnel and urgent activities in few centers while expanding health resources for COVID-19 patients, and simultaneously to avoid default of hospitals due to general overload. 41 A model of centralization to some \"Macro-Hubs\" was applied: for patients with STEMI, one or two Macro-Hub were identified in each area, according to the estimated transportation time of patients, geographical features and capacity to admit all the potential patients. The following requirements were further considered for potential Macro-hubs: to perform PPCI to all incoming STEMI, 24/7; to guarantee a PPCI team (interventional cardiologists, nurses and related staff) that would be available in hospital 24/7 and not on call; to provide internal, dedicated and separated, pathways for STEMI patients with suspected/diagnosed COVID-19 disease from triage, through catheterization laboratory to isolated care units, in order to reduce cross-infection rate at each step of the care process, and to guarantee a convenient protection of the healthcare professionals. Finally, the staff of the spoke hospitals were required to cooperate with the hub, to deliver the aforementioned level of care.",
