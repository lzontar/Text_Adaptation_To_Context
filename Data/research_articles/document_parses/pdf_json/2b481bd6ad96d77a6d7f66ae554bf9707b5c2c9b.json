Demyelination was more severe in BALB/c than in C57BL/6 mice. Virus particles were seen in oligodendrocytes in areas of myelin vacuolation 5 and 7 days post inoculation (DPI). Oligodendrocytes containing virus in BALB/c mice showed hypertrophy and vacuolar degeneration. There was a mononuclear cell infiltrate and lymphocytes and necrotic cells were present in vacuoles in myelin sheaths, Demyelinating plaques containing macrophages laden with myelin debris were most prominent 14 DPI when virus was cleared from the brain. Remyelination of the central type occurred 28 DPI in BALB/c mice. These findings indicate that direct virus-induced injury to oligodendrocytes has a major role in the initiation of inflammation and demyelination in this model system.",

These mutants allowed survival of most i.p. infected mice at doses which were lethal for the wt virus. Demyelination occurred in 35 ~ of weanling mice after i.p. inoculation with 102 p.f.u, of the mutant M136 (Sheahan et al. 1981) . Virus was seen in necrotic cells putatively identified as oligodendrocytes, and we suggested that the demyelination followed the selective destruction of these cells. We have subsequently found that the mutant M9 is a better model for the study of demyelination, since lesions of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis were detected in 94 % of mice infected with this mutant. Virus particles were present in cells which could be identified as oligodendrocytes, and a rapid cytopathic effect was produced in G26-24 (oligodendroglioma) cells after low levels of viral RNA synthesis (Atkins and Sheahan 1982) . Ultrastructural studies of infected G26-24 cells have shown severe cytolytic changes in the presence of small numbers of virus particles (unpublished data).",

The relative importance of these factors in different models has been the subject of intensive investigation (Wisniewski 1977; Dal Canto and Rabinowitz 1982) . The best studied virus producing a cytolytic effect on oligodendrocytes is the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). JHM-MHV has been shown to produce acute and chronic demyelination in mice (Lampert et al. 1973; Stohlman and Weiner 1981) as well as subacute and late demyelination in rats (Wege et al. 1982) . Variations in the type of disease produced by this virus are influenced by the dose of virus, the route of inoculation and the age of the host at the time of infection (Weiner 1973) . The virus occurs in ependymal cells, astrocytes, neurones, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells and cells of haematogenous origin (Fleury et al. 1980) . Demyelination in J H M -M H V infected mice appears to be dependent on direct cytopathic effect on oligodendrocytes rather than on the host immune response since immunosuppression enhances the mortality of infected mice but does not inhibit the demyelination (Weiner 1973; Weiner et al. 1973 ).",

In contrast to the J H M -M H V model, in which cellular infiltrates were reported as scanty or absent in the early stages (Powell and Lampert 1975) , mononuclear leucocytes were prominent in the lesions caused by M9 as early as 5 DPI. These leucocytes occurred in the perivascular spaces, in the parenchyma and in vacuoles in myelin sheaths. Necrotic cells showed a similar distribution suggesting that many were of haematogenous origin. Furthermore, in contrast to the cellular pantropism of JHM-MHV, M9 was found only in oligodendrocytes indicating that selective damage to these cells constituted the stimulus for the leucocyte response in this infection.",

The severity of myelin degeneration in M9 infected mice also appears greater than that reported in the A774 model. Kelly et al. (1982) described lymphocytes in the neuropil in A774 infected mice and concluded from the interaction between these cells and glia that the demyelination probably had an immunological basis. Virological studies showed that maximum demyelination occurred when virus had been cleared from the brain ). In the present study demyelination was also most active at a time when virus had been cleared from the brain and the number and location of lymphocytes in the CNS suggested that they, together with macrophages, played major roles in the mechanism of demyelination. It is known that lymphocytes can destroy myelin in vitro (Arnason et al. 1969) and that isolated myelin is vulnerable to attack by neutral proteases secreted by stimulated macrophages (Cammer et al. 1978) . The release of soluble products with myelinolytic activity from lymphocytes sensitised to myelin and/or viral antigens could account for the degeneration in some myelin sheaths invaded by lymphocytes in the present study. Similarly, the release of proteases from macrophages could account for the changes seen J 4 DPI which suggested that myelin was lysed from affected fibres by macrophages prior to phagocytosis.",

This finding is also consistent with the hypothesis that cells of the oligodendroglial line in mice can regenerate and replace those destroyed by virus infection (Herndon et al. 1977) . A few naked axons were seen in areas of remyelination in the present study 28 DPI. Since astrocytes are believed to play an important role in the remyelinating process (Blakemore 1981) it is possible that delayed remyelination of these axons may have reflected the vacuolar degeneration seen in astrocytes during the first week of the disease. The reason for the different responses of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice to infection with M9 remains to be determined. This and previous studies have shown infection by the M9 mutant of SFV in BALB/c mice to be an excellent model for the study of virus-induced demyelination and that the trigger for demyelination in this system is destruction of oligodendrocytes. We are presently utilizing a range of immunologically compromised mice to assess the significance of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of demyelination in this model.",
