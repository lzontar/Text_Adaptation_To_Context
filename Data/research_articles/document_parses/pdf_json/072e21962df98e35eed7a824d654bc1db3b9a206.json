The mechanism of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients is that lymphocytes, especially T cells, are attracted into the infection sites or killed by the coronavirus. These were described in detail in a recent review (Tay et al., 2020) . B cells are the source of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and part of lymphocytes, but the levels of circulating B cells especially activated B cells or plasma cells are unclear.
