An outbreak was declared and two interventions were undertaken simultaneously. In HTRs transplanted between February and October of 2013, serum galactomannan (GM) and screening chest computed tomography (CT) scans were performed, and if the CT scan of the chest was normal, they were started on inhaled amphotericin (Inh Ampho) for 3 months.

Hence, we could not rely on the latter as a screening tool, and performed low radiation dose CT scans of the chest on asymptomatic HTRs. This helped to identify two asymptomatic HTRs with IA, who achieved complete response to therapy at 12 weeks, as compared to partial response or failure to therapy in the rest of cohort, including three deaths.
