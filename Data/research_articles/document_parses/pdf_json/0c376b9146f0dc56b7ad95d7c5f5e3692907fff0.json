The infection probably started on Jan 28 and completed by Feb 6 for passengers ( Figure 1a ). However, crew members continued to get infected on and after Feb 6. The infection started among the passengers with a peak on Feb 3, which was the date when the ship just arrived in Yokohama. The decline of the infection after Feb 3 is expected as some passengers probably started to minimize their close contacts and social gathering. The crew infection was peaked on Feb 7, suggesting that some close contact continued to be significant among crew members after quarantine on Feb 5. This is not surprising as the crew members need to provide serves to the passengers. Kakimoto et al (2020) described the transmission among crew members during quarantine of the ship.

The infection among passengers was significantly reduced following the quarantine starting on Feb 5, but according to our prediction, the passenger infection was already on the way to decline from 3 Feb as they became aware of the outbreak and exercised selfdiscipline. For those infected in the staterooms with infected individual (i.e. close contact category), the infection occurred both prior to and after Feb 5 quarantine. The lack of crossroom transmission between passengers of different staterooms during the quarantine period strongly suggests that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was almost totally absent in the outbreak, based on our predicted data. The Diamond Princess Cruise Ship was built and completed in 2004 by Mitsubishi Industries. A centralized full-air air conditioning system with VAV was designed and installed in all passenger staterooms and crew cabins, with 30% fresh outdoor air for staterooms, 50% for public areas and 100% for clinics and kitchen etc. A fully independent exhaust air system was installed from the bathrooms. Although no measured ventilation rate was reported for the ship, international standard such as ISO 7547:2004 requires 8 Litre/s per person, which is similar to those in offices and other public spaces (ASHRAE62.1, 2007). It was also reported that the maximum outdoor air supply was operated during the quarantine period. This probably implied that a reasonably ventilated indoor environment such as that on this ship would not result in cross transmission of the virus due to the long-range airborne route.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "On the other hand, the predicted higher infection of non-close contact passengers prior to the quarantine and the higher infection for crew after the quarantine strongly suggested that the close contact and/or fomite transmission played a role.

The number of the infected in the close contact category, i.e. within-cabin transmission is only 17, the predicted infection dates might not be sufficiently accurate, and the data presented in Figure  1B is only indicative.

Diamond Princess actually had an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus in Feb 2016, in which 158 passengers and crew were sick on board (ABC News, 2016) . It is known that the norovirus infections on cruise ships affected the largest number of people (Harris et al., 2010) , often at hundreds. Crowdedness has been cited as an explanation for this cruise ship norovirus infection phenomenon (Harris et al., 2010, and Bert et al., 2014) . Surfaces on cruise ship public restrooms are known to have high potential for fecal contamination (Carling et al., 2009) . The same effect of crowdedness and fomite for the norovirus might have also happened to SARS-CoV-2 in this ship. The crowdedness and close contacts due to on-board leisure and social activities outside the staterooms could explain the observed higher infection among non-close contact passengers prior to the quarantine. According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan website (NIDD, 2020), for the 536 Covid-19 cases among 2646 passengers, a higher cabin occupancy corresponds to a slightly higher attack rate, possibly due to the relatively smaller number of the within-cabin close contact transmission. Based on our retried data from a drawing, only 6 out of 75 passengers from 1-person cabins became confirmed cases (attack rate 8%), while for 2-person cabins, 485 of 2386 passengers were infected (20%), for 3-person cabins, 27 out of 125 (22%) and for 4-person cabins, 18 out of 60 (30%).

It is noted that significant infection only started to grow on board from Jan 28 ( Figure  1a) . The on-board number of the symptomatic cases on Jan 31 was not significant.
