            "text": "There currently is no specific antiviral drug or a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infections; now exceeding 3,500,000 infections worldwide. In the absence of animal models to test drugs, we need to find molecular explanations for any unforeseen peculiarities in clinical data, especially the recent reports describing an unexpected asthma paradox. Asthma is considered a high medical risk factor for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, yet asthma is not on the list of top 10 chronic health problems suffered by people who died from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Resolving this paradox requires looking beyond the binary model of a viral receptorbinding domain (RBD) attaching to the ACE-2 receptor. A pBlast analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein contains two calcium-dependent fusion domains that were recently discovered SARS-CoV-1. These viral calcium-dependent binding domains can facilitate membrane fusion only after cleavage by the host surface protease TMPRSS2. Importantly, TMPRSS2 also requires calcium for its SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain and its LDLRA (LDL receptor class A) domain. Thus, the presence of EDTA excipients in nebulized \u03b2 2 -agonist medicines can disrupt SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection and can explain the asthma paradox. This model validates repurposing EDTA in nebulizer solutions from a passive excipient to an active drug for treating COVID-19 infections. Repurposed EDTA delivery to respiratory tissues at an initial target dose of 2.4 mg per aerosol treatment is readily achievable with standard nebulizer and mechanical ventilator equipment. EDTA warrants further investigation as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 /COVID-19 in consideration of the new calcium requirements for virus infection and the regular presence of EDTA excipients in common asthma medications such as Metaproterenol. Finally, the natural history of Coronavirus diseases and further analysis of the fusion loop homologies between the Betacorona SARS-CoV-2 virus and the less pathogenic Alphacorona HC0V-229E virus suggest how to engineer a hybrid virus suitable for an attenuated alpha-beta SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, replacing SARS-CoV-2 fusion loops (amino acids 816-855) with the less pathogenic HCoV-229E fusion loop (amino acids 923-982) may provide antigenicity of COVID-19, but limit the pathogenicity to the level of HCoV-229E.",

In the case of Coronaviruses (CoVs), it is not a simple two-step process of receptor binding (via the S1 domain) and membrane fusion (via the S2 domain containing the fusion peptide). Viral entry into host cells requires that there is a domain of the S protein that interacts with opposing hydrophobic cellular membranes called a fusion peptide or fusion loop. These fusion peptides (fusion loops, FL) are generally external amino acid domains that insert into the host membranes after major conformational changes of the virus S protein following proteolytic cleavage to initiate the process fusion with the host membrane.",

This process gives CoVs the unique flexibility to invade different cell types and host species. Additionally, the CoVs fusion process employs a calciumdependent fusion process that was only recently discovered for Rubella 16 and later described for SARS-CoV-1 infection. 17 While two fusion peptides (FLs) were found with SARS-CoV-1, influenza had no calcium-dependent membrane fusion process. The calcium dependent membrane-ordering results in more effective binding that can penetrate deeper into membranes. There are two FL domains in each SARS-CoV versus a single FL domain found in for HCoV-229E and Rubella shown in Table 2 below. Thus, this calcium-dependent requirement for the FL process may explain both the increased lethality of the beta CoVs and the apparent resistance of asthma patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to inhaling medications containing EDTA excipients.",

Currently, Metaproterenol Inhalation Solution USP is expressly formulated with EDTA (edetate disodium) as a unit-dose bronchodilator to be administered by oral inhalation with the aid of an intermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus (IPPB). It contains 0.4% or 0.6% Metaproterenol sulfate in a sterile, acidic, aqueous solution containing edetate disodium, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid, and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. 25 concentrations of EDTA (0.25 to 10.0 mg/mL) in a double-blind fashion. 26 [BMJ-1987] Here, EDTA produced concentration-dependent bronchoconstriction that did not resolve spontaneously within 1 hour. Mean EDTA PC 20 FEV 1 was 2.4 mg/mL (range 1.2 to 12.8 mg/mL). This study concluded that there was no significant difference in airway response to EDTA among volunteers receiving Beta2-agonist treatments. 27 To study off-target bronchoconstriction by EDTA, it was found that Albuterol (1 microgram/kg IV) significantly attenuated Na2EDTA-induced bronchoconstriction in canines. 28 Additionally, intravenous EDTA chelation therapy has been safely used for more than 50 years. 29 There were an estimated 500,000 visits for chelation therapy in the U.S. for 1993, 30 and 800,000 in 1997. 31 A Canadian survey found that 8% of patients who had undergone cardiac catheterization had used chelation therapy. 32",

The focus of the study is directed towards utilizing objective parameters that distinguish treatment groups. Parameters could include, RT-PCR results, clincal progress, and/or length of hospital stay, etc. Moreover, outpatient studies may be possible. That is, after initial medical supervision, the less clinically imparired COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR postive patients may be treated as an outpatient if the patient tolerates EDTA. Clinical measurements that may followed in clinic settings include vital Expert Panel found that EDTA ingredients are safe as used in cosmetic formulations. The typical concentration of use of EDTA in cosmetics is less than 2%, and the lowest dose reported to cause a toxic effect in animals was 750 mg/kg/day.41 Searching for the viral mechanisms to elucidate why asthma patients appearresistant to COVID-19 infection uncovered evidence for the key role of calcium in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection. First, new computer sequence analysis of SARS-COV-2/COVID-19 revealed two unrecognized calcium-dependent fusion loop domains. Second, the substrate recognition sites for the requisite cell surface protease TMPRSS2 have a conserved SRCR (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich) domain and a LDLRA (LDL receptor class A) that utilize calcium. Analysis of nebulizer solutions typically used by asthma patients, for example Metaproterenol, revealed the presence of an excipient called EDTA, a calcium-chelating agent. Triangulating these, the data converges on the previously unrecognized critical importance calcium for effective SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection, and how calcium chelation by EDTA may prevent infection. Accordingly, repurposing EDTA from excipient to therapeutic nebulized drug with or without Beta-2 agonist supplementation logically becomes a new treatment for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 patients. The potential to utilize EDTA to both reduce COVID-19 transmission and treat infection through relatively safe modalities that include nebulizer or mechanical ventilator misting of EDTA solutions (in conjunction with Albuterol/Metaproterenol to minimize bronchoconstriction if needed) and adding EDTA to hygienic products warrant further investigation(s). As either an \"Off-Label\" or formal IRB protocol, the clinician can measure the clinical response of nebulized pharmaceutically sterile Na2EDT dissolved in normal saline at a range up of to 1\u00b72 to 12\u00b78 mg/mL for the treatment of COVID-19 patients on respirators or with stand-alone nebulizers. When administering nebulized EDTA, the clinician should monitor for signs of bronchial constriction, and administer Albuterol as needed. Patients not on a respirator can be similarly treated with Na2EDTA solution through a nebulizer facemask under direct medical supervision, and if tolerated, the more stable patients may be treated at home or as outpatient with a nebulizer mask and Na2EDTA solutions.
