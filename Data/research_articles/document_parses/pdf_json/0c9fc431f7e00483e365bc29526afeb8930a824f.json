It is important for the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to be aware of the total number of infected people, which is probably underestimated due to the underreporting of mild and asymptomatic cases. In preliminary work we examined symptom-free travelers for SARS-CoV-2specific RNA to detect unnoticed COVID-19 cases. Among 122 passengers, who returned from Wuhan in February 2020, we identified two infected asymptomatic individuals (data not shown). This result suggests that the screening of asymptomatic individuals could be helpful in estimating the actual number of acute infections in the population. Several reports indicated that a combination of Realtime PCR (RT-PCR) and serological assays can be superior to identifying SARS-CoV-2 compared to RT-PCR alone [1] [2] [3] .",

These sera were also reactive to the spike protein at the surface of S1 expressing cells by native immunofluorescence analysis (nIFA as described in Kr\u00e4hling et al., 2016 [10] , with the exception that a pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2 spike expression plasmid was used) ( Figure 3B ). The remaining 24 sera were not reactive in either assay. We conclude that five out of 1,000 individuals tested developed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The remaining 24 individuals are likely to have cross-reactive antibodies from other human coronavirus infections. The five sera that were considered truly positive were reactive in the nIFA and in the neutralization test (NT), which indicated that it is possible to confirm the ELISA results with nIFA. This is an important result for laboratories that do not have access to a BSL3 facility. Two of the five seropositive volunteers stated that they underwent a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR-based). The other three subjects had not been aware of the infection. The first subject of this group had no symptoms in the past months and no known contact with a COVID-19 patient. The second subject had common cold symptoms 7 weeks before the start of the study, which was assumed to be caused by pollen allergy. This individual went to work regularly in overall healthy condition. The third subject had contact with a colleague who had subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. As a precaution he stayed at home for two weeks. At no time did he experienced any symptoms. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

The assay was performed as described for SARS-CoV-2 with the exception that the CPE was evaluated at day three post infection. Four out of five sera that bound the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and neutralised the SARS-CoV-2 virus also neutralised SARS-CoV. In contrast to published results [11], we do see a weak crossneutralization of SARS-CoV by SARS-CoV-2-specific antisera. This can be due to the use of different test systems. Ou and colleagues used pseudotyped VSV for their neutralization tests while we used wildtype SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.",

In contrast, among the 998 tested employees with unknown SARS-CoV-2 status, we found four who did not know they were acutely or previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (95% credibility interval (CrI): [0.163%; 1.022%]; Bayesian analysis using a flat prior [12] ). This result indicated the rate of unreported to reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in this study group was 2, a value which was unexpectedly low when compared with other respiratory diseases such as influenza (underreporting factor 79, USA, flu pandemic 2009, [13] ). One limitation of our study is that the sample was not random because only volunteers were included, so the sample may not be representative. A SARS-CoV-2 surveillance study, performed in Heinsberg, North Rhine Westphalia, Germany, reported 15.5% SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals in a group of 919 [14] . The site of this study was a hot spot of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The different SARS-CoV-2 prevalences (0.6% Frankfurt vs 15.5% Heinsberg) reflect the inhomogeneous pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany. To provide a reliable estimation of the average rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population in Hesse or Germany it is therefore mandatory to perform studies across the entire country and to combine these data. It will be also necessary to perform follow-up serological studies to determine the further spread of SARS-CoV-",

Those that exceeded an OD of 0.3 in the re-analysis were classified as positive. The final cut-off value of the ELISA was determined by analysing the OD values of 120 negative sera from 2014 with no history of SARS-CoV infection. The cut-off value was calculated as the average of the OD values plus 4 standard deviations. Classifying the negative samples according to the procedure described above resulted in one false-positive, indicating a specificity of 99.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 95.4% -99.98%). The analysis of successive sera from fifteen SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive individuals showed seroconversion in all cases (data not shown). The sample size is not large enough to make any precise statement about the sensitivity (95% CI: 87,2% to 100%). Using the newly developed SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, 1,000 sera of volunteers were screened for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 binding antibodies (Figure 2). We identified 29 reactive sera (Figure 3A, bars), which were further analysed for their neutralizing capacity against SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, sera were serially diluted starting with a dilution of 1:8. Then, 100 TCID50 units of SARS-CoV-2 (European Virus Archive Global # 026V-03883) were added. Following incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, Vero C1008 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were added per well. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was evaluated at day 4 post infection. Neutralization titers of four replicates were calculated as geometric means (reciprocal value).",
