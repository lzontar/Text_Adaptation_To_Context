Mao et al. (Mao et al., 2020) reported patients who were presented with only nonspecific neurological symptoms such as dizziness, ataxia or stroke without smell or taste disorders, and neuralgia due to peripheral cranial nerve involvement. They emphasized the need for high levels of vigilance and evaluation of neurological manifestations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for early diagnosis and prevention of the spread of infection through isolation, particularly in super-spreading patients. Our data suggest that the same approach may also apply to those presenting with SSNHL as the sole symptom. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 In our study, we observed COVID-19 in 1 of 5 (20%) patients with SSNHL symptoms with no prior risk factors for hearing loss. This result is important in that it shows that infected patients can also present in clinics with symptoms different from the previously identified ones in the literature. During this pandemic that has been claiming hundreds of thousands of lives, it would be important to recognize every possible symptom of the infection to break the chain transmission. Therefore, even if the sample size is low, our results carry importance for the global public health. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with isolated SSNHL. Therefore, our study is the first to bring awareness to the practitioners and researchers to look for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients with SSNHL.

Menachery 2020; Duarte et al., 2020; Carlos et al., 2020; Morse et al., 2020). The disease may be asymptomatic in about a third of the cases, accelerating the spread of the disease (Lai et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). The most common symptoms that accompany COVID-19 include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, diarrhea, and dyspnea. During the spread of the infection, nonspecific taste and smell disturbances have also been included in the spectrum of the symptoms (Viara et al., 2020; Mao et al.,2020). Viruses are known to cause neurological manifestations, such as anosmia, facial paralysis, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) (Kennedy 2010; Cohen et al., 2014; Mateer et al., 2018). During the previous SARS outbreak, coronaviruses were reported be associated with loss of sense of smell and taste due to neural injury (Haro-Licer et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2007). However, to our knowledge, no reports of SSNHL have appeared in the literature associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of patients presenting with non-specific symptoms during the pandemic may play an important role in breaking the infection chain and reducing the transmission. Given the previous literature data on coronavirus-associated SSNHL, we aimed to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients presenting with only SSNHL during this pandemic.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "The patient positive for COVID-19 received oral hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for five days in accordance with the republic of Turkey's health ministry COVID-19 guidelines. home-isolation of patients, early audiological evaluation after treatment started could not be performed.The hearing status of the patients was inquired by phone.

While most patients present with the predominant symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, muscle pain, and respiratory failure, anosmia and taste disorders alone or in combination with the common symptoms were further added to the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 (Vaira et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020). Viral infections may involve cranial nerves, leading to SSNHL, peripheral facial paralysis, or smell and taste disorders Kennedy 2010; Cohen et al., 2014; Mateer et al., 2018). The etiological factor for SSNHL was reported to cover many viruses such as herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis virus, measles virus, rubella virus, mumps virus, Lassa virus, and enteroviruses (Cohen et al., 2014; Mateer et al., 2018). Three mechanisms have been implicated in the occurrence of SSNHL associated with viral infections: neuritis caused by viral involvement of the cochlear nerves, cochleitis due to viral involvement of the cochlea and perilymphatic tissues, and the stress response resulting from the cross-reaction of the inner ear antigens to viral infections (Wilson 1986). Animal studies of a variety of viruses reported induction hearing loss by direct involvement of the inner ear structures or indirectly via cerebrospinal fluid (Nomura et al., 1985; Esaki et al., 2011; Yun et al., 2015; Cashman et al., 2018). Our findings suggest the need for RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 due to high suspicion of neurological involvement of COVID-19 in patients who are presented to otorhinolaryngology outpatient clinics with the sole manifestation of SSNHL during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the speed at which the infection spreads, it is of paramount that every possible symptom suggestive of the infection needs to be taken into consideration. In our study, one of the patients had a positive RT-PCR test result. consequence of identification of COVID-19 in the aetiology of SSNHL is choosing the right treatment strategy to maximize the clinical recovery and minimise the side effects and complications. Corticosteroids play a key role in the treatment of SSNHL (Hara et al., 2018). On the other hand, for the infection caused by this novel virus, like many other viral infections, the use of corticosteroids could present a risk of increasing the severity of the infection and cause delayed viral clearance (World Health Organization, 2020). Investigating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with SSNHL complaints and using other alternative treatment methods in COVID-19 positive cases could prevent such undesirable consequences. In our small series, the patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 was treated with oral hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice daily for five days and had a complete recovery from SSNHL.
