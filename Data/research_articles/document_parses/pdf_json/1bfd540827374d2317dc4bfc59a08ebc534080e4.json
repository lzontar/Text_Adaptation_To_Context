            "text": "The expression of ACE2 is most abundant in the kidney and intestine, followed by testis and the heart. [5] [6] [7] Moreover, the surface expression of ACE2 was found in lung epithelial cells. 8 Several groups generated ACE2-deficient mice [9] [10] [11] with conflicting responses on the contribution of ACE2 to cardiac structure and function, and the control of blood pressure. 12, 13 Due to its importance as an entry point for coronaviruses, the effects of ACE2 depletion was tested in lung tissue and shown to be detrimental in the progression of lung injury following experimental perturbations. 14,15 ACE2 depletion also created a \"cytokine storm\" like inflammation. 16, 17 A cytokine storm is a consequence of the secretion of a large number of cytokines and involves recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages. 18, 19 Cytokine storms are known to occur in autoimmune diseases 20 and can be triggered by chemical insults such as corneal alkali burns 21 as well as infections, such as COVID-19. 22 In COVID-19 patients, ACE2 is the target of the virus 23 and dramatic increases in plasma cytokines and chemokines such as IL1B, CCL2 (MCP1), CXCL8 (IL8), and TNF\u03b1 have been observed. 22 ACE2 is present in the retina 24 and recently, there has been a plethora of information regarding the expression in the cornea and conjunctiva due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] During our investigations using an ACE2deficient mice, we noted that as the ACE2-deficient mice aged, some developed cloudy corneas. In certain mice, cloudy corneas were bilateral, in others they were unilateral, whereas some adult aged mice had clear corneas. Herein, we report that AngII and ACE2 are expressed in limbal and corneal epithelia in humans and mice. Moreover, when challenged with corneal injury, ACE2-deficient mice are \"primed\" for an increased corneal inflammatory response. Once initiated, inflammation persists, which markedly alters the epithelial and stromal phenotypes. Blockade of the AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) partially restores the cytokine/chemokine balance due to ACE2 deficiency. Collectively, our findings establish a pivotal role of ACE2 in the cornea and identifies AngII blockade as a potential new target for corneal inflammation. Moreover, the administration of soluble ACE2 protein should have a therapeutic benefit by fostering the degradation of AngII and the formation of Ang 1-7 as it has proposed for other disease entities. 31 Of note, ACE2 is the main receptor for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the current pandemic. 23 The associated organ injury, particularly acute lung injury, has been shown to involve a decrease in plasma bound ACE2 and administration of such ACE2 have the potential as an ideal treatment, and Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice a unique model to study inflammatory processes akin to those observed in severe COVID-19.",

We used an ACE2-deficinet mouse (Ace2 -/-) on a C57Bl/6 background provided to us as a gift by Susan Gurley. 9 To generate debridement wounds in the central corneal epithelium, a rotating diamond burr was gently applied to the surface of the central cornea to remove the corneal epithelium while the peripheral corneal and limbal epithelia remained intact. Gross images of mouse ocular globes were taken using a Leica dissecting scope. Corneal haze was graded on a scale of 0 through 4 32 as follows: 0, no corneal haze; 1, iris detail visible; 2, Pupillary margin visible, iris detail obscured; 3, pupillary margin not visible; 4, cornea totally opaque. Wound closure was examined by topically applying 20 \u03bcL of 0.5% fluorescein in PBS and imaging the wound using a Leica dissecting scope under cobalt blue illumination. At the termination of the experiment, mouse whole eyes were fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution and paraffin embedded for histological analysis. H&E staining was conducted as described previously 33 and slides were imaged using an AxioVision Z1 fluorescence microscope system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).",

In all eyes exhibiting haze or cloudiness the stroma consisted of a densely packed admixture of polymorphonuclear, mononuclear, and lymphocytic infiltrates along with numerous vascular profiles ( Figure 3F -H). On higher magnification, the infiltrates were identified as neutrophils by H&E, and as macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells identified by immunohistochemistry staining for CD68, CD3, and CD11c cells, respectively (Figure 4 ).",

To test this idea, we made small 1mm circular debridement wounds in young Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice with clear corneas and compared the response to aged-matched WT littermates. In this well adopted procedure, the type of wound removes the corneal epithelium but does not result in a significant inflammatory infiltrate. 36 Immediately following wounding, all mice received topical application of a 0.5% fluorescein stain, and the rate of epithelial healing was visualized. As expected, WT mice sealed wounds within 24 hours ( Figure 5A ), whereas the Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice still had detectable fluorescein staining at this time ( Figure 5A ). Three days post wounding, WT mice had clear corneas devoid of fluorescein staining. Similarly, the Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice had minimal fluorescein staining 3days post wound; however, there was development of haze prompting further clinical evaluation of corneal clarity 32 ( Figure 5B ). Day 7 post wounding, WT mice appeared normal, whereas the Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice still had cloudy corneas and patches of fluorescein staining detected on the surface, suggestive of a defective epithelial barrier.",

This led us to postulate that external stress (eg, scratching or wounding) to the corneal surface resulted in an inflammatory event that could not be resolved due to the inability to regulate AngII. To test this concept, we induced gentle debridement of the corneal epithelium, which in WT mice does not result in a significant inflammatory response. 36 In the Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 , this procedure caused a significant inflammatory response in young mice with otherwise normal appearing corneas (Figures 5, 6 ). This strongly supports the idea that Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are \"primed\" for an inflammatory response and results in unresolvable inflammation after a mild perturbation. Similarly, Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice lungs following an insult resulted in worsened inflammatory cell infiltration and lung damage compared with WT mice; while there were no differences in unperturbed lungs between Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice. 14, 15, 43 In contrast, ACE2 deficiency led to increases in inflammation in mouse kidney and aorta even without perturbation. 44, 45 Although the lung and cornea are disparate tissues, the similarity in inflammatory responses raises the interesting question of what are the underlying mechanisms driving inflammation.",

This most likely reflects an earlier external trauma. However, it is also possible that cloudy corneas seen in older mice are the result of an enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species due to alterations in RAS, as it has been shown that ACE2-deficient mice exhibit increased oxidative stress. 46 It is well established that with age, the well-developed corneal antioxidant defense systems diminish, leading to ROS accumulation and oxidative stress (47 and references therein). This combination of ROS and oxidative stress can lead to many age-related ocular diseases of the anterior segment (for reviews see 47, 48) . In other tissues, such as the brain, AngII has been shown to induce NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production in isolated cerebral microvessels, resulting in cerebrovascular dysregulation. 49 In the ACE2-deficient mice, once an inflammatory response is initiated, inflammation persists becoming permanent, which remodels the stromal microenvironment. This microenvironmental change results in a wide range of epithelial phenotypes. The most dramatic is a cell fate switch from the transparent corneal epithelium to a keratinized, stratified squamous, psoriasiform-like epidermis. A similar cell-fate switch was reported in mice deficient in leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1). 50 In these mice, loss of LRIG1 resulted in a pro-inflammatory state in the cornea through upregulation of Stat3. The persistence of the inflammation eventually resulted in the generation of an epithelium that resembled human psoriasis.",

Unlike other ARBs, the effect of losartan can be overcome by high concentrations of AngII, which means that losartan is surmountable. 52 In addition, losartan needs to be converted in the liver to form its active metabolite EXP3174, which is 10-40 times more potent than losartan. 53 These two features of losartan may explain why we only see partial rescue in vitro.

            "text": "In the aggregate, our findings suggest that provision of ACE2 may provide a new strategy for treating corneal inflammatory conditions, as well as other indications such as kidney disease. Of potential clinical significance is the possibility that the Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mouse cornea might be an excellent model for investigations into the etiology and treatment of a coronavirus-induced inflammation. 54 The severe acute respiratory system coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have all been demonstrated to utilize human ACE2 as the receptor for entry. 23, 55, 56 In such a scenario, the coronavirus binds to and reduces the expression of ACE2; such a reduction increases AngII, leading to unregulated inflammation. Recently, it was demonstrated that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes in both lungs. 57 As the condition worsened, a dramatic cytokine-storm-driven inflammation was noted. 57 This phenotype bears striking similarities to what we report in the Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, suggestive that corneal inflammation in Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 mice may have a similar mechanism with that in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Thus, the eye becomes extremely attractive as a model to explore the molecular mechanisms, immunological changes, and treatment modalities in patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection for the following reasons: (i) mice cannot be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 making it difficult to find a direct experimental model; (ii) not having to use the live virus makes the Ace2 \u2212/\u2212 safer; and (iii) the relative ease of inducing and clinically detecting a corneal ACE2-deficient inflammatory response (corneal haze) is extremely convenient for observation.",
