Many factors may be involved in the transmission of this deadly disease but not muchsupporting data are available. Till now no proper evidences has been reported supporting that temperature changes can affect COVID-19 transmission. This work aims to correlate the effect of temperature with that of Total Cases, Recovery, Death, and Critical cases all around the globe. All the data were collected in April and the maximum and minimum temperature and the average temperature were collected from January to April (i.e the months during which the disease was spread). Regression was conducted to find a non-linear relationship between Temperate and the cases. It was evident that indeed temperature does have a significant effect on the total cases and recovery rate around the globe. It was also evident from the study that the countries with lower temperatures are the hotspots for COVID-19. The Study depicted a non-linear dose-response between temperature and the transmission, indicating the existence of the best temperature for its transmission. This study can indeed put some light on how temperature can be a significant factor in COVID-19 transmission.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "diverse influence on people's living environment in different parts of the world under differe nt climate conditions (4) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 120, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "SARS-CoV-2 the virus causing COVID-19 is spreading like a fire in the forest.

The world saw the first COVID -19 case on December 12, 2019 and soon within 3 months, the World Health Organization(WHO) declared it as a pandemic in March(6). Thus this points out how easily, it is spreading among the community and putting mankind in big suffering. Now this is going to another level of criticalness as it is in the third-and fourth-generation transmission i.e faster human to human transmission. Till now there are not many shreds of evidence, how temperature can be a guiding factor in the virus transmission, or what could be an appropriate range for the same. So a big question which is rumoring all around the world is whether the temperature is at all having any effect on the spread of this deadly disease. There may be some more important or deciding factors for transmission of this virus namely, humidity factor of different countries/places, immuniza tio n programs of different countries/government for growing immunity within people of differe nt countries. BCG vaccination may be a probable key factor for resisting the spreading of coronavirus. In India, BCG vaccination is done by the Govt. from a very earlier stage which might play an important factor So far, 11 different types of coronavirus have been identified. Some of them are O, A2, A2A, A3, B, B1 types. The original type was O which was mainly responsible for breaking corona in China. Since 24 th January 2020, the corona transmission throughout 60% of the countries of the world are mainly due to the A2A strain. As virulence factor varies greatly from strain to strain, the strain type should be an important variable in statistical analyses. Studies on SARS-CoV showed how transmission of the virus was dependent significantly on the temperature in the city of Beijing and Guangzhou(7) Various research revealed that there was a rise in the daily incidence rate of SARS CoV by 18.18 times when temperature was low compared to that of higher temperatures(8).

Results do suggest that regions having low temperatures are more prone to infection than that of the regions with higher temperatures. Although several other factors like hospital facilities, Governme nt awareness, Medical facilities should also be considered along with the temperature. Apart from this immunity is also playing a major factor in transmission. The population with higher immunity is less affected. Thus we can say that the emergence of the outbreak throughout the world may be narrowly related to the respective local temperature but other important factors are also playing a crucial role in the spread and control of the disease.
