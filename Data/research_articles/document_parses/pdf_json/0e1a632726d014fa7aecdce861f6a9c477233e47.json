Due to the easy access to online knowledge, high absenteeism has become one of the main problems facing medical schools. In addition, the costs of human tissue and ethical issues are significant burdens that are not easily overcome and make practical training with cadaveric courses an unavailable option for many institutions. Finally, environmental constraints are changing and, as a result, multiple reasons motivate students to stay at home.",

In the same way, the flipped classroom approach to teaching has been increasingly used in scholarly medical education. In such classroom applications, students are first exposed to content via online resources. Subsequent face-to-face class time can then be devoted to student-centered activities that enhance active learning (Ramnanan et al., 2017) .",
