However, the PN-based ceramics usually exhibit a low bulk density, which greatly limits their practical applications. In this work, CuO was used as the sintering aid to form a liquid-phase bridge, leading to an obvious increase of the bulk density of PN-based ceramics by 11% (from 5.25 to 5.85 g\u00b7cm -3 ) and the improvement of the piezoelectric constant (d 33 ) (from 168 to 190 pC/N) and the Curie temperature (T C ) from 367 to 395 \u00b0C. The positive influence of CuO on densification has been proved by SEM and fracture toughness. The XRD patterns confirmed that there was no secondary phase introduced by CuO addition. The Raman spectra revealed that part of Cu 2+ ions has probably diffused into host lattice of the PN and preferred to occupy on A-sites. These results not only demonstrate the high potential of the CuO added PN-based ceramics for high-temperature piezoelectric applications, but also reveal the corresponding structure-properties relationship as well as provide a way to improve the sinterability, d 33 , and T C simultaneously.",

It has important applications in high-tech fields and is a key material for manufacturing many instrument parts, such as the breathing valve of a ventilator that fights against the new coronavirus. At present, lead zirconate titanate ceramic (Pb(Zr, Ti)O 3, PZT) is the most extensively employed piezoelectric ceramic material for its excellent piezoelectric performance [1, 2] . However, an important disadvantage of PZT ceramics is that the Curie temperature (T C ) is relatively low, which limits its application in high-temperature environments. Compared to the conventional PZT ceramics, PbNb 2 O 6 (PN)-based piezoelectric ceramics possess a higher T C (\u2248 570 \u00b0C) and a series of other outstanding properties such as low mechanical quality factor (Q m < 20) including large anisotropy in electromechanical coupling coefficient. These characteristics make PN ceramics become a promising candidate for high-temperature devices such as wideband ultrasonic transducers and flow meters for which the traditional PZT and other piezoelectric ceramics cannot be applied. However, one of the major problems in PN-based ceramics such as commercial (Pb, Sr)Nb 2 O 6 (PSN) ceramics is its low bulk density which has a negative influence on polarization.",

Other ions, such as Ba 2+ , Ca 2+ , Sm 2+ , and Ce 4+ , have been also used to increase the densification of PN ceramics [6] [7] [8] [9] .

The improved sintering behavior of PSN-CuO ceramics can be attributed to forming the liquid phase bridge with CuO addition, which helps to accelerate mass transport, promote grain growth and particle rearrangement [15, 20] . In order to investigate the role of CuO on the structure of PSN ceramics in-depth, Raman spectra, which is highly sensitive to structural modification and has been successfully applied to the structural research of tungsten bronze structural compounds, was used to study the occupation of the Cu 2+ ions at the lattice of PSN ceramics. Fig. 4 shows Therefore, it fully reveals that the A-sites of the lattice are occupied by Cu 2+ ions in this study. From the enlarged Raman spectra around the mode at 632 cm -1 , as shown in Fig. 4b , it is clear that the peak narrows a little bit and shifts to the higher frequency after CuO addition, which can be ascribed to the increase of the stability of the NbO 6",

It can be seen obviously that the maximum dielectric constant (\u03b5 m ) increases from 2071 to 2797 as well as the T C takes on a significant increase by 28 \u00b0C (from 367 to 395 \u00b0C), and tan\u03b4 reduces a bit by CuO addition. The enhancement of \u03b5 r is mainly ascribed to the formation of a good microstructure with a substantial increase in the density and grain size [14, 26] . As we all know, T C is the transition temperature between the ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric phases, which is closely relevant to the stability of the ferroelectric one.

Such a consequence is consistent with the analysis of the occupation of the Cu 2+ ions at A-sites of the lattice resulting in the increase of the stability of the NbO 6 octahedra which reflects the increase of the stability of the orthorhombic phase in Figure 4 , as well as the substitution of small Li + ions in A-positions of the perovskite structural materials leading to the increased T C [28, 29] . The reduction of tan\u03b4 may be caused by reduced pores, which is in accordance with the explanation of improving density in Fig. 1 .

As is known, PN has three different crystalline phases: rhombohedral phase stable at low temperatures, tetragonal phase stable at high-temperature, and orthorhombic one transforming to tetragonal one at T C in the heating process. Among them, only the orthorhombic phase, characterized by a single (350) peak near 29\u00b0 and a (131)/(311) peak splitting between 27.5 ~ 28.5\u00b0, is a ferroelectric phase and presents piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties[9].

Three characteristic Raman bands, related to internal modes of the NbO 6 octahedra, are identified at around 242, 632 and 832 cm -1 , and classified as O-Nb-O bending vibrations, Nb-O stretching vibrations and Nb-O vibrations, respectively. In addition, the modes appearing at the low-frequency region (< 200 cm \u22121 ) reflect external vibrations concerned with the movement of the A-site cations [21-23]. For PSN ceramics, from the perspective of ion chemistry, the A-sites of the crystalline structure are occupied by Pb 2+ and Sr 2+ ions whose radii are 1.20 \u00c5 and 1.44 \u00c5, respectively. The radius of Cu 2+ ions (0.73 \u00c5) is smaller than that of Pb 2+ and Sr 2+ ions at A sites. So Cu 2+ ions can dissolve into A-sites of the lattice. Furthermore, in Fig 4c, the marked enhancement of the Raman intensity and sharpening of the mode at 76 cm -1 as well as the appearance of the mode at 115 cm -1 in PSN-CuO ceramics indicate that Cu 2+ ions change the vibrations of the A-site cations compared to PSN ceramics.",

The resistivity of PSN-CuO ceramics increases by an order of magnitude compared with the pure PSN ceramics, which could be owing to the addition of CuO partially precipitated at the grain boundaries and partially dissolved into the crystal lattice. In addition, the Q m , k t , and k p values of PSN-CuO ceramics basically unchanged compared to PSN ceramics.Besides, the d 33 values of the PSN ceramics with CuO addition have a substantial increase from 168 to 190 pC/N. As is well known, the values of d 33 are sensitive to grain size and polarization field strength. In this work, on the one hand, the increase of grain size caused by CuO addition leads to a decrease in the proportion of grain boundaries as shown inFig. 1. Furthermore, the resultant \"pinning effect\" of grain boundaries on the ferroelectric domain and domain wall movement reduces as well according to the grain size effect[30][31][32][33]. Consequently, the enlargement of grain size makes the ferroelectric domain easier to reverse and is beneficial to domain walls motion. Therefore, the response of ferroelectric domains to polarization electric field increases. On the other hand, the polarization field strength is generally associate with porosity and resistivity. The decrease of pores and the increase of resistivity are positive to improve the polarization field strength of PSN-CuO ceramics. Therefore, the improvement of d 33 values after CuO adding could not only attribute to the easier movement of the ferroelectric domain and domain walls but also the increase in the polarization field strength, which leads to more sufficient polarization.",

The PSN ceramics with CuO addition show better electric properties, particularly gain improved d33 (190 pC/N) and T C (395 \u00b0C). The improvement of d 33 values could be resulted from the easier movement of the ferroelectric domain and domain wall due to the enlargement of grain size, including the augment of polarization field strength owing to the enhancement of density and resistivity, which consequently makes the polarization more sufficient. The enhancement of T C may be owing to the enhanced stability of the NbO 6 octahedra and the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase.
