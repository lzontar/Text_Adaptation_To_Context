Unlike the wild type ]HM, these two mutant viruses grew more slowly with no prominent cell fusion. The buoyant densities of the mutants were slightly lower and 2c was revealed to have fewer peplomers than ]HM by electron microscopy. The purified ]HM contained five polypeptides with molecular weights (M.W.) of 260,000, 105,000 (GPI05), 65,000, 60,000 (P60), and 23,000 (GP23). In addition to two polypeptides, P60 and GP23, which were common to ]HM and the mutants, la was found to contain three other specific polypeptides with M.W. of 180,000 (GPIBO), 110,000, and 95,000 (GP95), while 2c had GP180, GPI05, GP95, and one with a M.W. of 175,000. All of these polypeptides were shown to be glycosylated except for P60. After bromelain treatment, all these viruses lost the peplomers and contained P60 and another new 18,000 dalton polypeptide. 445 ",

An MHV strain, JHM, causes acute or chronic encephalitis and demyelination in mice and rats (7, 16, 29) , and it may provide an experimental model for virus-induced disorders of the central nervous system. In this context, chronic JHM infection in the central nervous system seems to be of interest. As an approach to understanding the viral persistency in vivo, we previously established and studied an in vitro persistent infection with JHM in a SR-CDFl-DBT (DBT) cell line derived from a mouse brain tumor (8, 9, 12, 15) . From this persistently infected cell culture, two small plaque viral mutants were isolated.",

The structural proteins of JHM were reported by Bond et al (I), Wege et al (28) , and Siddell et al (21) , but the results described here mostly agree with those reported by Siddell et al (21) . Although some workers (21, 28) noted the presence of aggregated proteins on top of the gels and the loss of some virus proteins by heating, no aggregation occurred on top of the gels after heating in our experiments. However, when samples were subjected to electrophoresis without boiling, GP260 was converted to 220,000 dalton glycoprotein (GP220), whereas there was no change in the other four proteins (data not shown). This heating effect on M.W. of GP260 was similar to that observed with GPl70 of JHM by Siddell et al (21) . We could not fully explain the difference in M.W. of peplomer forming glycoproteins, especially between our GP220 or GP260 and GP170 as described by others (21, 28) . However, we obtained a T 1 fingerprinting pattern of RNA from JHM (unpublished data) almost identical to that described by Lai and Stohlman (14) but not to that described by Wege et al (27) . Genetic mutation and/or the selection of virus sources might have occurred during the passage of each virus, affecting the M.W. of peplomer forming glycoproteins.",

Peplomer-forming proteins were also thought to be crucial in the induction of cell fusion (3, 11, 20) . The reduced fusion activities of 1a and 2c in DBT cells as compared with JHM may result not only from the change of peplomer-constituting proteins but also from the quantities of these proteins produced in infected cells.
