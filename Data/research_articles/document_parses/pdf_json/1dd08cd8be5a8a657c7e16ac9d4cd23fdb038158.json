The approach is based on the theory of learning from errors, specifically adapted to the control of the virus spread by reducing infection rates using countermeasures such as medical treatment, isolation, social distancing etc. When these are effective, the infection rate, after reaching a peak, declines following a given recovery rate curve. We use presently available data from China, South Korea and others to make actual predictions of the time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future.",

This theory has been previously applied to outcome, accident and event data from multiple socio-technological systems, like transportation, medicine, military, power grids, aviation, mining, and manufacturing. Learning theory simply postulates that humans learn from experience in correcting their mistakes and errors (sometimes even just by trial and error), as they gain knowledge on the problem and skill for addressing it. The theory is consistent with the models and data in cognitive psychology of how humans behave and the brain operates (Ohlsson, 1996; Fiondella and Duffey, 2015; Anderson, 1990; Duffey, 2017b) . The importance of this theory stands in that human errors and incorrect decisions are the dominant contributors to accidents, crashes, system failures, errors, and operational incidents.",

Evidence on this relates to even highly hazardous industries like the nuclear one. A good example is that the safe operation of nuclear power plants has been, and continuous to be, improved from lessons learned from nuclear accidents and incidents. These accidents and incidents, in addition to highlighting the role of human errors in their occurrence and progression, have helped identifying various critical technical elements and contributed to the safer operation of nuclear power plants. Similarly, the observation is applicable to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Improving health systems following epidemic outbreaks and enhancing reliability and safety measures following nuclear power plant accidents have to be handled with objective data and accurate calculations. However, whereas nuclear power plant operation has done this by a world-accepted, high standard of procedures, the \"protection system\" against pandemics is not there yet. The key is how to design, evaluate and implement the procedures, for reaching a high standard.",

The novel feature is to replace calendar time or test interval, which has always been used before, with a measure for the accumulated experience and/or risk exposure, thus defining rate trends and quantifying effectiveness of responses to errors and accidents, and allowing totally different systems to be directly intercompared. Additionally, the trend is governed by two parameters that are physically based: the learning rate constant and the minimum achievable error rate. This is in contrast with statistical analysis ,where fitting to learning data is typically done on three empirical parameters (Bush and Mosteller, 1955 ) , and with the inverse \"power laws\" extensively fitted in cognitive psychology data ( e.g. Anderson, 1990 and the references therein).",

This is a typical modern city that had grown in population from 120,000 to about 8 million people, and includes characteristics of immigration, high-density living, mass transportation, high-rise apartments, modern health care, national and international trade, and a large flow of inbound-outbound travel, in other words, globalization. The biggest improvement in health has come from introducing effective hygiene and anti-infection measures, and from improved health prevention and treatment (not from wonder drugs): we have learned how to treat sick people, cure problems and reduce the spread of bad diseases. It is an expensive investment and it is hard work that requires devoted and trained professionals. As a result, after curing and containing many pestilences during the 19th century, the average death rate in New York over the last hundred years has fallen to 10 to 11 per 1000 people, or almost exactly the same one-in-a-hundred rate as the world rate.

Korea open triangles) and the widely used IHME model projections with the Universal Learning Curve shown in the Figures 4 and 5 are compelling. The data fits with learning curve theory, which we know already incidentally fits millions of events, accidents and trends. China, Italy and S. Korea have indeed learned how to control the spread of a viral pandemic. All other countries/systems/people have to do to predict the infection rate evolution is to follow the same trend after first reaching their rate peak. This type of analysis allows countries and systems to compare the effectiveness of their countermeasures implemented to control the pandemics and the related timescales.",

These are just calculated risk estimates, which are subject to uncertainty related to all the many endogenous factors related to the virus spreading, and the actuation and respect of the measures implemented. The numbers provide guidance to thinking about the absolute risk and the best approach to take given the risk is constant unless we do nothing to reduce it! The strong message here is that the rational and logical approach to dealing with the risk of the occurring pandemic (as with any other risk, for that matter) is to limit own personal and potential exposure, and to minimize both the size and scale of the potentially exposed population. This is precisely what governments and contagious disease experts have been saying all along-but is also what any individual should be doing anyway while exposed to the risks of \"normal\" life. A sort of ethics of resilience (B. Rajaonah and E. Zio, 2020).",

            "text": "In the above graph of Figure 4 , the infection reduction/recovery rate for Italy was estimated to occur in about 30 days, by assuming it was a timeframe similar to that of China. The present prediction is, then, that there is at least a 30-day recovery timeframe as the horizon for the infection rate to get down to a minimum achievable level of say 50 per day (as for China); infection rates should be below 10% of the peak (i.e. about 600 per day) in about 3 weeks from the peak. But this prediction can be effectively monitored and should be updated as more data arises. In fact, at present, only very few days have elapsed since the seemingly reached peak rate, so it is useful to look at a future trajectory. This can be done as in Figure 6 , by plotting the data simply changing the denominator of the non-dimensional elapsed time after the peak rate N* from the 30 days (27 March to 27 April) assumed in analogy to China, to say 20 days (27 March to 6 April) or 40 days (27 March to 6 May) for estimated reduction to the (non-zero) minimum (i.e. 50-100 per day). This sensitivity analysis allows to verify, based on objective data, whether or not any change or improvement in countermeasures is warranted, and by how much. The calculations can assume the infection rate peaked either on about 24 March or March 29, the latter being shown as giving the fewest data points (see Figure 6 above)",

A key point is to look at infection rate, as a measure of error outcome, and time, as a measure of experience/knowledge or risk exposure which allows learning. The analyses of the currently available data show that the CoVid-19 infection rate data follow, after peaking, almost exactly the Universal Learning Curve describing the decreasing trajectory of many other instances where humans learn to apply effective countermeasures. More specifically, the learning curve is nearly the same (with universal constant K~3) as for any learning experience reducing outcomes, accidents and events for other modern technological system operated by humans. We claim that this trend decline due to learning is direct evidence of learning about risk reduction, also in this case of the pandemic, and call it the Universal Recovery Curve. It can be used to predict the expected time at which the pandemic will be under control, in terms of minimum achievable infection rate, and to test and demonstrate the relative author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
