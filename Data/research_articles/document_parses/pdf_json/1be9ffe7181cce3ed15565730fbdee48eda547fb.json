A benchmark of this infectious disease, caused by the pathogen coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is the high transmission rate of asymptomatic and preasymptomatic individuals [4, 6] who traveled unrestrictedly and spread out COVID-19 through all continents resulting in the pandemics declaration by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Efforts to track the transmission started in Wuhan to the rest of mainland China and world has been relied on mathematical modeling [2, 3, 5, 7] and was soon extended to other countries [8, 9] , using the metapopulation approach [10] [11] [12] . In this modeling, the population is grouped in patches representing geographic regions and the epidemic contagion obeys standard compartmental models [13, 14] within the patches, while mobility among them promotes the epidemics to spread out through the whole population.",

The total number of municipalities is 5570 [16] . According to estimates of 2019 [16] , the total population of the country is 210 millions of inhabitants. The most populated state is S\u00e3o Paulo with 46 millions inhabitants and its homonym capital city is the most populated municipality with 12.2 millions inhabitants whereas the lowest populations are in the state of Roraima, with 605 700, and in the municipality of Serra da Saudade, with 781 inhabitants. Other characteristics of the Brazilian demography are the broad distributions of the rural and urban population fractions and urban population densities of municipalities.

Demographics and mobility data mined from public sources are used in the simulations. We intend to quantify how diversified can be the epidemics across the country rather than accurately predict epidemic outbreaks in specific places. We use simulations to determine the level of dispersion in the epidemic curves in different places within a hypothetical scenario of uniform mitigation measures. We take the situation of 31 March 2020 as initial condition with foci in 410 municipalities, allowing to track in a single integrated simulation the epidemics in all municipalities. Our approach consists in calibrating the model with a few weeks of COVID-19 cases officially reported in Brazil and perform long-term analysis of epidemic outcomes using different mitigation scenarios. We report that the epidemic curves can vary enormously across several scales from state' to municipality' levels passing by intermediate and immediate regions. We could also identify that some states are featured by outbreaks starting mainly in their capital cities, followed by epidemic waves propagating toward the countryside while in other states there are multiple initial foci of epidemics. Our results pave a road for public policies to fight COVID-19 that should be simultaneously decentralized, in the sense that each locality has to consider its specificities, and integrated since the fate of one region depends on the attitudes adopted by others.",

The population is divided into patches which represent the place where they live as schematically shown in Fig. 1a) . This model is inspired on a recent work [9] where a deterministic microscopic Markov chain approach [17] was used to investigate the COVID-19 epidemics in Spain. A patch can represent a municipality, a neighborhood or any other demographic distribution of interest. Each patch is labeled by i = 1, 2, . . . , \u2126, where \u2126 is the number of patches and has a fixed resident population given by N i . The inter-patch (long distance) mobility rate is given by W ij defined as the number of individuals that moves from i to j and return to i after a typical time T . So, W ii = N i \u2212 j =i W ij is the population of patch i that does not leave it. A patch j for which W ij > 0 is a neighbor of i. Different forms of mobility with the corresponding characteristic times can be implemented. For sake of simplicity, recurrent flux of individuals per day (T r = 1 d) was used in the present work. Mobility within patches is not explicitly considered. Instead, we assume the well-mixed population hypothesis [13] where an individual has equal change to be in contact with any other in the same patch. Six compartments used in the SEAUCR model are susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic (A), unconfirmed (U), confirmed (C) and recovered (R).",

These parameters provide an effective infection rate \u03bb k = 0.78 that represents an optimist estimate nearer to the lower bounds estimated in other studies of COVID-19 spreading [6, 8, 9, 27] . The confirmation rate 1/\u03b1 (0) C = 10 d was calibrated together with the initial conditions (subsection III D) to fit the amplitude after 31 March 2020 and also the total number of municipalities with confirmed cases in a moderate mitigation scenario; see subsection IV A. To date of 23 April 2020 Brazil had performed less than 1400 tests per 1 million inhabitants [28] . Assuming a time window of 45 d for testing, we have approximately 1/30 000 per inhabitant a day. Since tests can be applied more than once in a same infected patient, we will use \u03b6 = 1/40 000 d \u22121 per inhabitant. This is a very rough estimate since the official number of tests was unknown at the moment of writing. Due to the testing targeted only to severe cases of respiratory syndromes adopted in Brazil to the date of investigation, the transition from asymptomatic to confirmed was neglected setting \u03b2 C = 0 , remarking that the model can easily reckon such a transition if the testing scenario be different.",

Each federative state or municipality has its own mitigation and testing policies that are very heterogeneous. So, assuming uniformity and fitting the overall data at a country level, it is possible to infer in which regions the epidemic is evolving faster or slower than the average. Finally, our initial condition is a guess driven by data but still limited. The level of underreporting is known to be high, and broad ranges of values have been reported [4, 30, 31] . One limitation that can be easily identified is that municipalities without confirmed cases on 4 April are assumed to have no infected individuals of any type (E, A, U, or C) at March 31, which is probably not the case of the real system.",

The metapopulation approach allows to investigate the epidemics at a municipality level [8, 9, 11] . Figure 2b) shows the number of municipalities with confirmed cases obtained in simulations with different mitigations and reports for Brazil between 1 and 22 April of 2020. Again, the moderate mitigation provides the best agreement with the reported data. Deviations start to appear after three weeks. No tunning with respect to specific places was used and, consequently, it does not reproduce accurately the amount of reported cases for all federative states as expected, see SI-1 of the SI [21], due to the diversified testing and lockdown policies across different states in contrast with the uniformity hypothesis of the model.

The total number of cases changes very little since the leading contribution comes from local transmission in municipalities with larger incidence at the initial condition while the number of municipalities with confirmed cases, shown in Fig. 2c) , depends significantly on the long-distance traffic restrictions. These results confirm the epidemiological knowledge that reducing long-distance transportation contributes for delaying the outbreak onset in different places but alone alters little on the overall epidemic prevalence once the seeds have been spread out [33] , as already discussed for COVID-19 spreading on mainland China [3, 34] . Irrespective of the heterogeneous testing approaches through states, we assume that essentially all municipalities have capacity to detect COVID-19 in the first hospitalized patients and, therefore, the number of municipalities with positive cases is expected to be an observable much less prone to the effects of underreporting. Figure 3 compares the evolution of municipalities with confirmed cases obtained in simulations with different mitigation measures and real data for each Brazilian state. The moderate mitigation parameters (M, K) = (0.4, 0.3), which fit better the overall data for Brazil, also perform well for most of the states in this time windows and specially those with higher incidence of COVID-19 which lead the averages over the country. However, some states (AC, AM, PA, PE, PI, and RR -acronyms for Brazilian federative states are given in Fig. 3 ) are more consistent with the simulations without mitigation while others (PB, PR, and RN) are nearer to a strong mitigation. A map with the classification of mitigation measures that fit better the data reported for each state is presented in Fig. 3 .",

It confirms that long-distance mobility plays a minor role on the overall epidemic prevalence, only slightly reducing the maximum of the peak, as seen in the curves of K = 0.3 fixed and M varying. Cutting down the amount of contacts is indeed the most efficient way to flatten the curve. The maximum number of symptomatic individuals drops by a factor 5 when the contacts are reduced to a half while the time of the epidemic peak doubles. Remarkable diversity of the epidemic outbreaks can be observed among all geographical scales. At federative state level the time when the outbreak reaches the maximum epidemic prevalence, the epidemic peak, vary considerably as shown in Figs. 4b) and c), where the epidemic prevalence is shown as function of time for a moderate mitigation. Such a feature was observed in other metapopulation approaches for epidemic processes [8, 11] . Let T and \u03c1 be the time and prevalence of the epidemic peak. According to the simulations with moderate mitigation, the first state to reach the peak would be CE (T CE \u2248 34 d), followed closely by SP and AM (T SP \u2248 T AM \u2248 36 d). The prevalences would be \u03c1 CE \u2248 3.6%, \u03c1 SP \u2248 4.9% , and \u03c1 AM \u2248 5.0%. The state with higher epidemic prevalence would be RJ with \u03c1 RJ \u2248 7.0% at day T RJ \u2248 40. The epidemic peak would happens later (T MA = 71 d), with maximum less intense (\u03c1 MA \u2248 2.3%) and the curve broader for the MA state. The MA case is particularly interesting because while the peak for the state happens last, for its capital city S\u00e3o Luis it occurs at day 41 slightly earlier than average peak for the Brazil, which happens by day 44. In the simulations without mitigation, the times in days and prevalence percentage of the epidemic peaks are (T CE , T SP , T AM , T RJ , T MA ) \u2248 (28, 29, 26, 29, 48) and (\u03c1 CE , \u03c1 SP , \u03c1 AM , \u03c1 RJ , \u03c1 MA ) \u2248 (5.9, 7.9, 7.5, 10.9, 5.1) while in the case of strong mitigation simulations provide (T CE , T SP , T AM , T RJ , T MA ) \u2248 (49, 55, 56, 62, 68) and (\u03c1 CE , \u03c1 SP , \u03c1 AM , \u03c1 RJ , \u03c1 MA ) \u2248 (1.5, 2.0, 2.2, 2.8, 0.6). Therefore, the model predicts that mitigation attitudes will imply in diverse levels of impact in different states even under the hypothesis of uniform measures in all regions. Table SI -II of the SI shows prevalence and time of the peaks for all states for these 3 mitigation strategies.",

An intermediate region agglomerates immediate regions preferentially with the inclusion of metropolises [35] laying thus between immediate regions and federative states.

The broad variability of epidemic outbreaks observed at the federative state level is repeated at higher resolutions of geographical aggregation. Figure 5 shows the multi-scale structure of the outbreaks within the MG state, comparing the epidemic prevalence of different intermediate regions (top), followed by the next scale with all immediate regions belonging to the two intermediate ones presenting the epidemic peak first and last (middle), and finally the highest resolution with curves for municipalities (bottom) within the immediate regions with earliest and latest maxima shown in Figs. 5b) and c).",

One can see that federative states with smaller territorial areas, such as SE, RN, and RJ, tend to present smaller dispersions of the peak time while those with mainland scales and more sparsely connected territories, as AM, MT, and MS, present larger dispersions and outliers. We also have states with large territories but better connected such as SP, PR, and RS, for which the dispersion is significant but not characterized by outliers. Irrespective of the more cohesive pattern of outbreaks, the epidemic peaks in immediate regions of the SP state can take more than twice as long as the peak at the capital city. On other hand, the outbreaks in the RJ state are less desynchronized than in its neighbors MG and SP states with the latest immediate region reaching the epidemic peak only 50% later than the capital Rio de Janeiro.",

An average epidemic wave propagating approximately from east, where are the populated lands, to northwest can be seen at a country level. Moreover, when the epidemic is losing strength in east, the countryside is still facing high epidemic levels. Maps and movies suggest that the epidemics starts in the more populated places, usually the largest metropolitan regions, and spread out towards the countryside municipalities. This is quite clear in the SP state, where the focus begins in its capital city, and moves toward west into the countryside.

We classified the federative states according to the correlation between T and D in three groups: not significant for which the p-value is larger than 0.02; strong correlation that has statistical significance with p < 0.02 and r > 0.6; and moderate correlation with p < 0.02 and r < 0.6.

States of the north region (RR, RO, AP, AC, AM, PA, and TO) have few immediate regions distributed in large territories and less connected. So, lack of correlations is not surprising. Moderate correlations in states as MG, BA, and GO with large but better connected territories are due to existence of multiple important regions that play the role of regional capitals.

The diversity of outcomes is observed in several geographical scales from states to immediate regions, that encloses groups of nearby municipalities with strong economic and social ties. The stronger mitigation attitudes the more remarkable are the differences.

In a municipality where the peak naturally happens after the capital of its state, it will delay even more if strong mitigation measures are adopted synchronously with the capital. On the one hand, such a municipality probably would have to extend the mitigation for much longer periods since once the epicenters of epidemics start to relax their restrictions the viruses would circulate faster, reaching these vulnerable municipalities with essentially the entire population still susceptible. The social and economic impacts could be higher. On the other hand, an eventual collapse of the local heath system in countryside regions could also occur after the larger metropolitan areas were under control paving the possibility of unburdening the local healthy care system.",

Curves for all intermediate regions of the 26 federative states are shown in Fig. SI-7 of the SI [21]. Stepping down to immediate regions, a similar behavior is found in Figs. 5b) and c). The intermediate and immediate regions of Belo Horizonte, that include the capital city and is by far the most populous region of the state, lead the averages over state and intermediate regions, respectively, hiding the actual prevalence in the other localities. Variability is still large within immediate regions as shown in Figs. 5d-g) with the epidemic prevalence (transparency curves) at different municipalities of a same immediate region. This pattern is repeated for other federative states varying only the dispersion amplitude. Figures describing this multi-scale nature for CE, RJ, RS, and SP states are available in Figs.
