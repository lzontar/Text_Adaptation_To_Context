The University of Oxford has developed an Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) to offer a systematic way to follow the stringency of government responses to the pandemic across countries and time [2] . The Stringency Index consists of school closure (C1); workplace closure (C2); public event cancellation (C3); restrictions on gathering size (C4); public transport closure (C5); staying at home requirements (C6); restrictions on internal movement (C7); restrictions on international travel (C8); and public information campaigns (H1).
