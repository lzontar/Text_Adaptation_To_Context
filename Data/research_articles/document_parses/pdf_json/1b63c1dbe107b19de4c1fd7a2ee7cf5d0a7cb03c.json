            "text": "In December 2019, the first cases of a new disease of unknown origin were identified in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, China. The pathogen involved was named Coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) responsible for COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) . 1 The rapidity and global reach of COVID-19 have made the World Health Organization (WHO) define the disease as a public health emergency of international interest. 2 Urgent questions were raised that required coordinated and certified information from public healthcare systems to delay its devastating power and identify the primary modifiable environmental factors that could increase the severity of health outcomes (age, hospitalization, intensive care unit, mortality) among individuals with COVID-19. 1, 3, 4 More than 297,000 people have died, and more than 4.6 million have fallen ill. 5 However, for those who have not been contaminated, the disease has caused significant changes to their lifestyle. COVID-19 also caused some unexpected consequences, such as the closure of industries, trade of nonessential items, transportation networks, and companies, accompanied by drastic declines in environmental pollution as governments introduced strict restrictions to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic. 6 Air pollution is known to cause damage to many organs and body systems, especially the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, being responsible for 4.2 million deaths (7.6% of total global deaths) in 2015. 7 Declining levels of pollution have also been noted in northern Italy, coinciding with the national lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which resulted in less traffic and industrial activity. A recent study identified correlations between COVID-19 mortality in northern Italy, including Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna, and the high levels of pollutants in those regions. 11 This decrease in environmental pollution was also seen in Barcelona, Spain, after two weeks of lockdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. 12 It is known that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by aerosol and fomites is plausible, and the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces for days. 13 Setti et al. 14 infection. This association suggests that individuals exposed to chronic high levels of air pollution may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This would occur as a result of compromised immune defense responses due to pollution, as has already been demonstrated in patients affected by severe viral pneumonia during other pandemics. 17, 18 Recent studies suggest that the cause of death of many COVID-19 patients would be related to cytokine storm syndrome, a severe reaction of the immune system that leads to a chain of destructive processes in the body that can end in death. 19 Similar trends were observed in other regions of Europe, such as In the United States, a recent study investigated the average long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the risk of death from COVID-19. It has been shown that an increase of just 1 \u03bcg/m 3 in PM2.5 is associated with a 15% increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate, (95%CI: 5% to 25%), with a magnitude 20 times greater than that observed for PM2.5 and mortality from all other causes, suggesting that long-term exposure to air pollution increases the vulnerability to the occurrence of more severe results from COVID-19. 21 Although the transmission of the disease beyond Asia was initially focused on Western Europe and North America, there has been a significant expansion to other parts of the world, including many Latin American countries. 22 ",

Monitoring of satellite pollution from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency, 6 found that in cities in northern China, such as Beijing, where much of the pollution comes from heating during the winter, there have been no reductions. However, in southern cities such as Shanghai and Wuhan where there is heavy industrialization and intense air pollution, the decline in pollution was very substantial. The decline demonstrated a clear correlation of COVID-19 infestation 9 in China with levels of pollution and local climatic conditions with a low temperature, moderate daytime temperature range, and low humidity that would favor the transmission of the virus. 10",

The results were corroborated by Coccia et al. 15 who demonstrated that the accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 resulted mainly from transmission by contaminated air to man, besides the transmission from man to man. The exhaled droplets would be stabilized in the air from the aerosol fusing with the PM in highly concentrated stable conditions. Under normal conditions with clean air and atmospheric agitation, a small droplet meets with the virus and evaporates or disperses rapidly in the atmosphere. On the contrary, in a stable atmosphere with high concentrations of PM, viruses have a high probability of agglomerating with the particles and reducing their diffusion coefficient, increasing their amount of time and permanence in the atmosphere, and becoming more contagious. 14 In England, Travaglio et al. 16 provided further evidence of the relationship between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 lethality by showing an association between pollutants released by fossil fuels and susceptibility to viral",

This trend was seen in Paris, Lyon, and Toulouse and regions like the Belgian-Swiss border near Lyon and the coast from Nice to Montpellier, where there is a significant problem with air pollution and large agglomerations. 20 This has also been proven in the Czech Republic where the intense pollution in Prague and the highly industrialized eastern regions of the country is strongly correlated with the number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. 20 In Poland, when comparing polluted areas and the total number of novel coronavirus infections in each province, there was again a very high agreement. The province of Mazovia led in the number of COVID-19 cases with Upper Silesia taking second place. In all of these areas, the mean PM value fluctuated from 19.58 \u03bcg/m 3 to 29.84 \u03bcg/m 3 (daily allowable PM2.5 concentrations = 25 \u03bcg/m 3 ). 20",

There was less of an influence of vehicle emissions at the PUC Minas S\u00e3o Gabriel Station, considering the PM2.5 (breathable particulates) and NO2 pollutants. 23 Researchers estimated that the population of the southwestern Amazon had high exposure to air pollutants. This estimate was based on data from 30 airquality monitoring sensors installed in 22 municipalities in the state of Acre from June to December 2019. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the regional health system may be depleted when compounding the crisis installed by the COVID-19 pandemic with the already observed increase in fires and deforestation and the high atmospheric pollution of this region. 23 Recently, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA)presented a report highlighting that measures to combat the novel coronavirus led to a reduction of approximately 40% in the average levels of NO2 and 10% in",
