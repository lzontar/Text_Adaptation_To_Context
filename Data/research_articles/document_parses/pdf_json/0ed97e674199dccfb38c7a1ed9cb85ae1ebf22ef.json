In the context of the social determinants of health, focusing on health system preparedness is paramount for protecting the health of all of society. Faced with old threats (e.g., re-emergence of measles), disruptive new technologies (e.g., electronic cigarettes), increased challenges (e.g. drug-resistant organisms), and new threats (e.g., the current pandemic, climate change, politicized misinformation), our health systems must be robust and resilient. The response must include those who now suffer disproportionately-the poor and the vulnerable. Current World Health Organization priorities call for infrastructures capable of detecting, monitoring, and responding to health emergencies, such as COVID-19, and the health impacts of climate change in the context of health for all. Health care infrastructure can be better prepared and more equitable if systems are strengthened by building on core competencies and following the recommendations made for leadership, stakeholder involvement, accreditation, data collection, and funding resources. Ensuring health equity in a pandemic requires robust and resilient public health infrastructure during normal times.",

Shortly afterward, several other cases were reported, and within weeks an epidemic had engulfed Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province in China. This outbreak of what was a novel coronavirus was the beginning of a worldwide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that we now know causes COVID-19. The pandemic has stressed public health services around the world and has shown the importance of having robust, well-structured, and well-resourced health systems in place. The current pandemic demonstrates the challenges that we must overcome as a global community to ensure equitable health care access, economic security, and public health protections for vulnerable communities.",

We are in a globalized world, possibly a plane ride away from a major disaster. Globalization changes the way we manage health threats-it has closely integrated commerce, transportation, economics, and all forms of communication. The Internet and social media have actively democratized information, doing good in many ways when they serve as a major source of factual information. But misinformation and disinformation are also commonplace and create an enormous threat to public health by spreading inaccurate and deceitful material. In addition, the speed at which information now moves around the world is staggering, compounding the difficulties of advancing factual information during a public health emergency.

Tragically, underserved and vulnerable populations are being disproportionately affected, just as they are by most health threats. It is essential that we focus efforts on ensuring that vulnerable populations receive equal access to testing, community protections, and treatment when they get sick. In addition, economic burdens for this population can be overwhelming as many live from paycheck to paycheck during normal times and are dependent on a range of social supports for survival. During extraordinary times such as this, extraordinary levels of support are needed to alleviate food insecurity, strengthen health care systems, and protect human rights, especially the rights of women and children, who frequently experience domestic violence and social practices that harm them disproportionately. Economic support is also essential because severe economic disruptions affect low-income workers the most. Nations with weak health systems are at significant risk from this pandemic and will require significant support from other nations to prevent widespread morbidity and mortality.",

These collaborations should have shared governance that works to obtain adequate resources and collective action to achieve shared health promotion and disease prevention objectives. Actions should produce equitable and resilient communities. 3. Public Health Accreditation. Public health agencies should seek accountability for their public health responsibilities. In the United States, this can be done by becoming PHAB accredited. Accreditation has been shown to improve agency capacity and quality (5) . The recommendations of Public Health 3.0 are embedded in the appropriate PHAB criteria. Currently, about 80% of the United States population is covered by an accredited health department (https://phaboard.org/2019/09/03/ benefits-of-phab-accreditation-reaching-more-communitiesas-covered-population-continues-to-climb/) and the goal is to achieve 100%. 4. Improving data for decision making. Public health agencies must have access to more secure, granular data (preferably at the sub-county or postal-code level) in a timely way to make actionable health decisions. Today, health threats enter communities with great speed and the need to address them requires cross-sectoral data systems that allow for the ability to measure impact in a variety of ways. Data systems must collect data in a way that allows health equity to be evaluated. 5. Adequate public health funding. Funding for public health has been inadequate, not only in the United States, but also in many industrialized nations, and especially those with weak health systems (1). Public Health 3.0 supports enhancing resources for public health systems to ensure adequacy and sustainability. Development of new and innovative models to achieve this enhanced support are recommended, both for core activities and community-wide initiatives. Funding is essential for achieving health equity objectives.",
