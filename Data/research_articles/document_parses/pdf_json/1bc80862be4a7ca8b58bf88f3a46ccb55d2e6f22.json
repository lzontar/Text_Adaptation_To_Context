Here we report that analysis of a urine sample on admission to hospital can be used to detect systemic capillary leak syndrome, which can be a predictor of fluid overload, respiratory failure, need for ICU admission, and death. At our medical centre (University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany), we identified abnormalities in the urine samples of patients with COVID-19 who became very sick within a few days. Three of these patients had coincidentally submitted urine samples in the few weeks before their infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These urine samples had been normal. However, on March 21, 2020, since becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, the urine sample of one of these three patients was also positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The urine samples of the other two patients have not been tested because of safety concerns.",
