First, early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for severe influenza should be emphasized [1, 7, 12, 16, 17, 21, 34] . Patients should be encouraged to present as soon as symptoms develop, despite vaccination status [7] . Prompt laboratory diagnostic testing may be used to guide treatment [1, 7, 24, 26, [35] [36] [37] ; RT-PCR, if available, is the test of choice because of its high sensitivity and specificity [26, 38] . If the more sensitive tests are unavailable, empirical antiviral therapy may be considered, especially during seasonal peaks (when there is a high likelihood of influenza) and when patients are seriously ill [38] . Second, an extended therapeutic time window for initiation of antiviral therapy may be considered. Previous clinical trials involving otherwise healthy and younger, nonhospitalized patients have suggested that, to produce clinical benefits, antiviral treatment has to be initiated within 48 h after symptoms initiation, because active viral replication will have largely subsided beyond that time (determined on the basis of viral cultures) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 34] . However, among older patients with comorbidities who present after 48 h, particularly in association with severe, persistent symptoms, the viral load may remain very high (and culture positive). Recent observational studies suggested that antiviral treatment started within 4 days after illness onset might reduce mortality among adult patients hospitalized with influenza [6, 9, 39] . In this study, antiviral treatment started within 4 days of illness was observed to enhance viral load decrease and clearance when compared with no treatment, after adjustment for confounding variables [17] . Viral clearance correlates with symptom resolution and may be associated with shortened duration of hospitalization [7, 18, 19] . Randomized, controlled trials are necessary to clarify further the clinical benefit of delayed therapy, and this study of viral kinetics provides useful information for planning (eg, therapy guided by the viral load, instead of time of symptom onset) [16, 39] . Third, a more stringent approach to infection control may be necessary to avoid nosocomial transmission, because hospitalized patients may have high viral loads and a long duration of viral shedding, as detected by both RT-PCR and culture methods [17, 18, 29, 30] . These measures include strict droplet precautions and, preferably, isolation for an extended period of time (15 days) [1, 18, 28, 29, 40] , especially for patients without antiviral treatment [13, 15, 18, 28, 29, 40, 41] .
