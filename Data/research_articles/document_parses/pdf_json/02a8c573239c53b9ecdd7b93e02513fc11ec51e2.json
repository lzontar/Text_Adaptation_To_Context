Although CHIKV infections are rarely fatal, the disease can evolve into a chronic stage, which is characterized by persisting polyarthralgia and joint stiffness. This chronic CHIKV infection can severely incapacitate patients for weeks up to several years after the initial infection. Despite the burden of CHIKV infections, no vaccine or antivirals are available yet. The current therapy is therefore only symptomatic and consists of the administration of analgesics, antipyretics, and anti-infl ammatory agents. Recently several molecules with various viral or host targets have been identifi ed as CHIKV inhibitors. In this chapter, we summarize the current status of the development of antiviral strategies against CHIKV infections.",

CHIKV infections cause Chikungunya fever which is characterized by abrupt fever, rash and bilateral symmetric arthralgia. In most of the CHIKVinfected patients the acute phase is followed by persistent disabling polyarthritis that can severely incapacitate the patient for weeks up to several months [ 1 ] . Despite the widespread emergence of CHIKV and the high morbidity rate associated with it, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available at the moment. The current therapy is therefore purely based on the relief of the patient's symptoms and consists of the administration of analgesics, antipyretics, anti-infl ammatory agents such as paracetamol, and nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs, and of bed rest and fl uids intake [ 2 ] . The use of aspirin during CHIKV infection is to be avoided because of the risk of bleeding and the potential risk of developing Reye's syndrome [ 3 ] . In addition, the use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended due to the strong rebound effect after cessation of treatment [ 1 ] . In severe cases, where patients have limited response to nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, or sulphasalazine can be administered to relieve the symptoms [ 3 , 4 ] . The development of novel, potent antiviral drugs against CHIKV is thus urgently needed.",

An arbidol-resistant CHIKV strain could be selected and was shown to have acquired a mutation at amino acid 407 (G407R) in the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein, which may be involved in binding to host receptors [ 10 ] . Recently, a series of arbidol analogues have been synthesized and evaluated for their anti-CHIKV activity [ 11 ] . Two analogues in this series (IIIe and IIIf) inhibited the CHIKVinduced cytopathic effect (CPE) with selectivity indices higher than that of the parent compound arbidol [ 11 ] .",

Ribavirin was shown to inhibit the replication of CHIKV in vitro [ 20 ] . In addition, the combination of ribavirin and IFN-\u03b12b was reported to result in asynergistic inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication in Vero cells [ 20 ] . The mechanism of the antiviral action of ribavirin is likely different for different viruses. The 5\u2032-monophosphate metabolite of ribavirin acts a competitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphatedehydrogenase (IMPDH) resulting in a depletion of intracellular GTP (and dGTP) pools [ 21 ] . The predominant mechanism by which ribavirin inhibits the replication of other RNA viruses such as fl aviviruses and paramyxoviruses has been shown to be mediated by depletion of GTP pools [ 22 ] . Other suggested mechanisms by which ribavirin inhibits RNA virus replication include the inhibition of viral RNA capping, inhibition of the viral polymerase, and lethal mutagenesis of the RNA genome [ 23 ] .",

Interestingly, the knockdown of the HSP-90\u03b1 subunit resulted in a more pronounced inhibition of viral replication than targeting the HSP-90\u03b2 subunit. HSP-90\u03b1 is thought to be involved in the stabilization of CHIKV nsP4 and the formation of the CHIKV replication complex [ 36 ] . Further mechanistic studies are required to unravel the role of HSP-90 in the replication cycle of CHIKV. The innate immune system plays an important role in the acute phase of CHIKV infection. Detection of CHIKV RNA by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, and 8, as well as RIG-I like receptors during the acute phase of infection is believed to trigger the production of type I IFNs. Consequently, type I IFNs activate the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode proteins involved in the host antiviral defense leading to clearance of the infection [ 37 ] . Therefore, activation of the innate immune response could be interesting for the treatment of CHIKV infections.",

            "text": "The global re-emergence of CHIKV and the high morbidity rate associated with its infection emphasizes the need to develop potent antiviral agents against CHIKV. So far, a number of classes of compounds that inhibit viral replication by targeting either a viral or a host factor have been reported. Most of the compounds have relatively modest activity and for most of them, activity in infection models (in mice) was not assessed. Some of these classes may serve as a starting point for the design of more specifi c and selective inhibitors of CHIKV replication. Also, to the best of our knowledge, no information is available yet on the effect of antivirals on the chronic stage of CHIKV infection. Recently, mouse models for CHIKV-induced arthritis and chronic joint disease have been developed which will help the evaluation of CHIKV antiviral agents in different stages of CHIKV infection [ 47 , 48 ] . Several other viruses belonging to the Alphavirus genus, in particular the equine encephalitis viruses are considered to be a potential bioterroristic threat. When designing/developing antivirals against the Chikungunya virus it may be important to develop classes of compounds that have pan-alphavirus activity and that could thus also be used for the treatment of alphaviruses other than CHIKV. Among the reported CHIKV inhibitors, favipravir, ribavirin, arbidol, and IFN-\u03b1 have been approved previously for the treatment of other viral infections. This could markedly facilitate their evaluation for clinical use in CHIKV-infected patients. Favipravir, a drug with a broad-spectrum antiviral activity, has been approved in Japan for the treatment of infl uenza virus infections. It is currently also being evaluated in Western Africa for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. If its activity is demonstrated against this infection, this compound may be considered for treatment of other infections such as those caused by CHIKV. However, given the growing number of patients suffering from CHIKV infections, it may be justifi ed to develop specifi c CHIKV/alphavirus drugs. Highly potent drugs are today available for the treatment of infections with herpes viruses, HIV, the hepatitis B and C virus. Without a doubt, it should also be possible, when investing suffi cient effort, to develop highly effective and safe drugs for the treatment (and perhaps even prophylaxis) of infections with alphaviruses.",
