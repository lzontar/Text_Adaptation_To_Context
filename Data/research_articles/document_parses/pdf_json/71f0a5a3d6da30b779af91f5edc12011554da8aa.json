Polyclonal antiserum was produced against purified Rubisco from the marine diatom Chaetoceros gracilis. The results of western immunoblotting demonstrated that the antiserum reacted positively with Rubisco from 38 species of algae and higher plants and failed to react with only three species of dinoflagellates and one prochlorophyte species. However, the binding affinity or the strength of the cross-reaction for the polyclonal antiserum with purified Rubisco varied among species. The antiserum was then affinity purified against spinach Rubisco and its binding affinity for purified Rubisco determined by ELISA. Two taxonomic groupings resulted: one with high-binding affinity (these species included chrysophytes, bacillariophytes, prymnesiophytes, and chlorophytes) and the other with low-binding affinity (dinophytes and cyanophytes). Rubisco concentration per cell and light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were highly correlated for cultures of the diatom Tha/ussiosira weissfogii. These results indicate that affinity-purified antiserum can be rigorously characterized for use in quantifying Rubisco concentration and for assessing the maximal photosynthetic potential of individual phytoplankton cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Assessing the magnitude and variance of primary production in the marine environment is a major goal of biological oceanography.

As generally applied, the 14C method determines C assimilation rates for \"bulk\" phytoplankton in mixed-species assemblages but gives little or no information about the variability in photosynthetic activity at the scale of the individual species or cell. Statistical information on the underlying variability at the level of the individual phytoplankton cell is necessary to resolve differences in primary production and loss at the next highest scale (i.e. bulk assemblages). Sampling at the scale of the individual cell provides the most basic information for interpreting variance in primary productivity among bulk assemblages (Huston et al. 1988) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 276, "end": 288, "text": "(Watt 197 1;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 289, "end": 318, "text": "Platt and Sathyendranath 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 386, "end": 405, "text": "(Kolber et al. 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 408, "end": 428, "text": "Barnola et al. 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1135, "text": "(computer programing", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1965, "text": "(Huston et al. 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A limited number of oceanographic studies of photosynthetic or growth rates of individual phytoplankton cells or species have been carried out with autoradiography (Iturriaga and Marra 1988) , 14C labeling of individual cells (Rivkin 1990) , and cell division patterns (Weiler and Eppley 1979) .

By coupling flow cytometry with immunological probes for taxonomic identification (Shapiro et al. 1989) or quantification of specific cellular components (Orellana et al. 1988) , it is possible to address questions relating to the variability in photosynthetic rates and physiological processes among individual cells or taxonomic groups in phytoplankton assemblages. The specific goal of the present work was to develop a method to determine maximal photosynthetic potential for individual phytoplankton cells. To do so, we developed an immunological probe against the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The reasons for selecting this key enzyme of the Calvin-Benson cycle are as follows. Rubisco is responsible for net COZ assimilation. Under conditions which favor carboxylase activity as opposed to oxygenase activity (e.g. high ratios of CO2 to O,), maximal light-saturated rates of photosynthesis are proportional to Rubisco concentrations (Bjorkman 198 1; Rivkin 1990 ). The enzyme is ubiquitous in all photoautotrophic plants and is also found in various photosynthetic bacteria. The large subunit of Rubisco contains the active catalytic site and is highly conserved (Miziorko and Lorimer 1983) . Because it is a soluble protein and a major constituent of phytoplankton cells, Rubisco can be easily detected in individual cells with immunofluorescent probes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 292, "end": 313, "text": "(Shapiro et al. 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 364, "end": 386, "text": "(Orellana et al. 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1218, "text": "(Bjorkman 198 1;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1230, "text": "Rivkin 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1432, "end": 1459, "text": "(Miziorko and Lorimer 1983)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In order to use an immunoprobe to quantitatively measure Rubisco concentration within individual cells in a mixed-species assemblage, it is imperative to determine: first, whether the probe is truly specific to only the large subunit of Rubisco; second, whether the probe binds to the Rubisco large subunit of all phytoplankton species with equal affinity; and third, whether immunologically determined concentrations of Rubisco are well correlated with maximal photosynthetic rates.

Because the probe has a much lower binding affinity for dinophytes and cyanophytes, Rubisco cannot be measured in these groups and it is essential to identify individuals belonging to these groups.
