The overall positive rate (47%) was about twice higher than previous reports based on conventional methods. Influenza A, parainfluenza and RSV accounted for 51%, and non-cultivable viruses accounted for 30% of positive cases. Influenza A peaked at March and June. Influenza B was detected in January, February, and April. Parainfluenza was prevalent throughout the year except from April to June. Most RSV infections were found between February and September. Adenovirus had multiple peaks, whereas rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43 were detected mainly in winter and early spring. RSV infection was associated with bronchiolitis, and parainfluenza was associated with croup; otherwise the clinical manifestations were largely nonspecific. In general, children infected with influenza A, adenovirus and mixed viruses had higher temperatures.

A review of the standardised discharge data for all Hong Kong government hospitals from 1997 to 1999 showed that acute respiratory infections accounted for 38% of all paediatric admissions and 63% of those age under 5 years [Nelson et al., 2007] . A large spectrum of viruses can cause respiratory tract infection. The routine rapid diagnostic method used currently in Government hospitals in Hong Kong is immunofluorescence test on nasopharyngeal aspirate. This method can cover upto seven common respiratory viruses (influenza A and B; parainfluenzae types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus). By this method alone, an aetiological diagnosis was made in less than 20% of cases [Lam et al., 2007] . Viral culture, although being carried out routinely in referent laboratories, is less helpful in patient management because of the long turnaround time, and inability to detect fastidious viruses. The lack of a highly sensitive and rapid test to confirm the etiology of acute respiratory infection has caused greater concern since the outbreaks of avian influenza A H5N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong in the past. These outbreaks have posed special challenges for paediatric practice in hospitals as suspected cases had to be confined in isolation rooms before the suspected pathogens were exlcuded [Leung et al., 2004] . This aggravated the shortfall of isolation cubicles and also caused great distress to children and their family. Urgent PCR tests for coronavirus and infleunza A H5N1 have since become available for pneumonia cases with severe respiratory distress, and for avian infuenza cases suspected on the ground of history of travelling to endemic areas or contact with birds; but this policy of selective testing is inadequate to cover all the clinical needs.",

Influenza A, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were the most frequently identified pathogens which accounted for 51% of all positive cases (Table I) . Nineteen patients had coinfection with two pathogens. These included three cases with metapneumovirus plus mycoplasma, two cases with adenovirus plus chlamydophila; and the remaining 14 cases had other combinations. Parainfluenza virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, rhinovirus and metapneumovirus were the pathogens found most commonly among coinfections. SARS-CoV and influenza A H5N1 was not detected during the study period. Figure 1 shows the monthly distribution of the number of positive specimen for each pathogen. Influenza A infection peaked in March and June. Influenza B was detected in January, February, and April. Parainfluenza virus was prevalent throughout the year except from April to June. Respiratory syncytial virus was also prevalent throughout the year but was more common from February to September. Adenovirus showed multiple peaks, and was more active from November to April. Both rhinovirus and coronavirus OC43 were detected more often in winter and early spring. Mycoplasma pneumoniae peaked at March.",

In concordance with previous reports [Druce et al., 2005; Weigl et al., 2007] , respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, and parainfluenza virus were identified most frequently, and accounted for 51% of positive cases in the current study population. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus were the predominant viruses detected in infants younger than 6 months old, whereas 39% of adenovirus infections occurred in children between 3 and 4 years old. Influenza A were evenly distributed in children between 1 and 5 years old. Other viruses identified more frequently included influenza B, coronavirus OC43 and rhinoviruses; each accounted for 7-8% of positive cases. Mycoplasma and human metapneumovirus each accounted for about 3% of positive cases. Enterovirus, reported to be circulating widely in children [Juv\u00e9n et al., 2000; Tsai et al., 2001] , was identified in three cases only (two single and one coinfection). A previous local study on the viral etiology of acute respiratory infections in children carried out from August 2001 to July 2002 using RT-PCR for the detection of rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and coronavirus; and immunofluorescence and culture for other respiratory viruses showed slightly lower positive rates for adenovirus (5% vs. 3%), influenza B (3% vs. 1%), parainfluenza (9% vs. 6%) and respiratory syncytial virus (8% vs. 7%). The positive rates for influenza A and coronavirus were similar, whereas the positive rate for rhinovirus (4% vs. 35%) was remarkably higher in the previous study [Cheuk et al., 2007] . This discrepancy of Sung et al. rhinovirus detection rates might be due to differences in the sensitivity of PCR tests used. Nevertheless, both studies continued for only 1 year and the seasonal pattern of respiratory viral activities might vary in different years. Further prospective studies of longer duration are necessary to elucidate the epidemiology and disease burden associated with rhinovirus in Hong Kong.",

This is in agreement with a previous report that gastrointestinal symptoms were common in human coronavirus OC43 infections [Vabret et al., 2001] . Febrile convulsions and asthmatic attacks were observed in 6% and 4% of positive cases respectively, which were in line with previous reports [Gr\u00fc nberg et al., 2001; Chung and Wong, 2007] . Notably, more rhinoviruses were detected between October and December which are peak months of asthma admissions in Hong Kong. In this study, 2 of 17 patients with rhinovirus infection had asthmatic attack as the principal diagnosis of their admission. However, the number of rhinovirus positive asthma cases was too small to allow further evaluation on the association. In line with a previous report [Lin et al., 2007] , the current study revealed that adenovirus, influenza A and mixed viral infections were associated with higher fever than other single viral infections.",
