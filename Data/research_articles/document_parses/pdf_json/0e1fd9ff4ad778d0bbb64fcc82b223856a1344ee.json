RSV leads to in significant morbidity and mortality, with 14,000 reported deaths, and more than 177,000 hospitalizations annually in the USA among adults 65 years of age and older [2] . In addition, elderly patients with underlying high-risk conditions are prone to complications related to LRTIs, resulting in prolonged hospitalization, and therefore potentially death [15, 19, 20] . Although RSV typically presents with mild cold-like symptoms, RSV can sometimes lead to more severe complications including LRTI, pneumonia, and exacerbation of underlying conditions such as CHF, asthma, and COPD [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Similarly, most hospitalized high-risk patients in our study were older (average age 77 years) and diagnosed with LRTI (84.3%, excluding influenza, RSV, or hMPV), and had previous evidence of pneumonia Most available research on the economic burden of RSV in the USA predominantly focuses on infants or adult patients in private insurance populations that largely comprise patients less than 65 years of age. These studies highlight the increased burden of RSV due to the higher utilization of healthcare resources including intensive care and ventilator support, and the costs incurred as a result of underlying conditions [26] . In a study by Han et al., the annual total costs related to RSV pneumonia hospitalization in all elderly patients aged 65 years and older were estimated in the range of $150-680 million [27] . Pastula et al. also indicated that the average hospitalization costs associated with RSV infection among all adults in the USA were $38,828 [28] . Amand et al. found that the incremental differences in adjusted annual healthcare costs between patients with and without RSV was higher among patients aged 65 years and older ($12,030-23,194 ) than among those aged less than 65 years old ($2251-5391) [18] . The current analysis observed significant increases in medical resource utilization after RSV diagnosis, including an increase in the number of subsequent inpatient admissions and prolonged hospital LOS among high-risk hospitalized patients. The higher resource utilization observed in this study also translated to increased healthcare costs.
