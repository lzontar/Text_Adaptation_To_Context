By April 12, 2020, more than 1.5 million people had been infected and 114 197 had died worldwide as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1 The first case in Portugal was reported on March 2. National authorities then established and upgraded contingency measures culminating with the declaration of a state of emergency, for only the second time in almost 50 years of Portuguese democracy. By April 12, a total of 16 585 cases had been confirmed in Portugal; 504 individuals (3.0% of those confirmed as infected) had succumbed to COVID-19 and 228 (1.4%) were in the intensive care unit (ICU). 2",

Medical departments and equipment have been adapted and elective procedures postponed. Meanwhile, patients are being offered telephone appointments to mitigate the impact of such changes. Nevertheless, potentially severe conditions are being denied timely treatment. Although the anticipated bottleneck in the care of COVID-19 patients was ICU beds and ventilators, healthcare workers, including cardiology professionals, are being assigned to tasks unrelated to their specialized training in order to compensate for the structural shortage of human resources in healthcare. This situation poses unique challenges for the care of non-COVID-19 patients, with unpredictable short-and long-term consequences, and a concerted strategy to mitigate these effects must be put in place.",

Of note, on a week-by-week analysis, there was a trend for increasing number of deaths during March 2020, anticipating the expected rise in mortality in the following weeks ( Figure 2A ). In fact, between April 1 and April 7, 2020, a total of 2 568 people died in Portugal, compared to 2 114 during the same period in April 2019 (+21.5%), of whom 193 died due to COVID-19 (7.5%) and 2 375 from other causes ( Figure 2B ). 2, 9 Cardiovascular-related symptoms are usually among the most frequent in the ER, and cardiovascular mortality is the leading cause of death in Portugal. It is therefore legitimate to ask whether cardiology patients are refraining from pursuing appropriate care, or alternatively, whether COVID-19 presentation is overlaying cardiovascular disease, leaving non-respiratory disease in the background. Data for the upcoming months will be decisive in solving this puzzle.",

Our findings are similar to those described in other countries. As an example, a nationwide survey in Spain reported a 40% decrease in STEMI admissions in a pre-/post-COVID-19 week-by-week comparison. 8 Preliminary data reported by the Portuguese Association of Cardiovascular Intervention (APIC) on a webinar from the Portuguese Society of Cardiology are in line with these observations.",
