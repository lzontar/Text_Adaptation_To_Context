Kowalski further developed a computer model K K to simulate a three-dimensional intensity field in a rectangular system. The detailed information can be found in related references (51, 52, 54) .Odor is usually caused by some volatile compounds generated by bacteria. The locations of most concern may be the upper side of sewage treatment basins, sludge treatment tanks, and some meat processing areas. The air emission often brings ammonia, sulfur compounds, indole, skatole, and other odor-causing compounds. Conventional odor control methods include scrubbing, biological filters, and activated carbon adsorption. UV-based oxidation units provide a simple and safe way to control odor. The strong In comparison with other common disinfectants, such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, monochloramine, and ozone, UV is simple, produces no harmful by-products (Tables  5-7) , requires secondary disinfectant (Tables 5-8) , requires on-site production and high maintenance (Tables 6 and 7) , is very effective for viruses and bacteria, but inffective for water with Giardia r r cysts, high suspended solids, high color, high turbidity, or soluble organics (Table 8) . UV is usually applied toward the end of the water treatment process to minimize presence of other contaminants that interfere with UV (Table 9 ). According to Wang (57, 58) , UV is also very effective for dechlorination, dechloramination, or deozonation if it is required in water or wastewater treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1, "end": 5, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 282, "end": 286, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 821, "end": 825, "text": "(51,", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 826, "end": 829, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 830, "end": 833, "text": "54)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1963, "end": 1972, "text": "Wang (57,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1976, "text": "58)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1497, "end": 1510, "text": "(Tables  5-7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1557, "text": "(Tables 5-8)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1625, "text": "(Tables 6 and 7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1792, "end": 1801, "text": "(Table 8)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1938, "end": 1946, "text": "(Table 9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "annex"}]}
