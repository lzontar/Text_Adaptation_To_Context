Schefold 2 , Jaume Baldir\u00e0 3 , Thibaud Spinetti 2 , Kordo Saeed 4 and Gunnar Elke 5 Despite the exponential growth in research following the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in COVID-19 patients remain poorly understood. The increased incidence of cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications, immune cell deactivation and sepsis-like multiple organ failure suggests the involvement of multiple pathways. Accordingly, recent studies have proposed that virus-induced endothelial dysfunction and damage, resulting in impaired vascular blood flow, coagulation and leakage, may partially explain the development of organ dysfunction and oedema [1] . Hence, the development of endotheliitis may be a prominent, yet partly under recognised, feature of COVID-19 induced critical illness.",

This is surprising, since ADM has been shown to play a key role in reducing vascular (hyper) permeability and promoting endothelial stability and integrity following severe infection [2] . Thus, ADM may also be of interest within COVID-19 induced endotheliitis. Indeed, a recent study investigating gene upregulation in patients with systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS), characterised by plasma leakage into peripheral tissue and transient episodes of hypotensive shock and oedema, found that ADM was not only one of the most upregulated genes, but that subsequent application to endothelial cells resulted in a protective effect on vascular barrier function [3] .",

Despite the low number of severe viral cases within each of these studies (between 2.1% [3] and 3.4% [4] ), similar hypotheses can also be formulated for patient populations with COVID-19.",
