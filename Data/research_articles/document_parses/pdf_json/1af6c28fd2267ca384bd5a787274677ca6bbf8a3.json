The UN Convention signed at Vienna on December 20, 1988 , was the first response to bring harmony to enforcement.\" 3 It is important to take into account that criminalizing money laundering emerged as a measure to inhibit the use and benefit of illegally acquired assets. Thus, it is a crime derived from another, and could not exist without the antecedent crime having been previously committed. It is, in the words of Jean Larguier and Philippe Conte, a \"consequential crime,\" as opposed to behavior preceding or concurrent with the primary act or attempt. 4 To confidently benefit from its illegal income, organized crime has protected itself well, much like the Government, causing the latter to turn to the most modern mechanisms for combating crime.",

It sought to prevent the illegal traffic in artwork by requiring special export licenses and an administrative control system to enable Member States to prevent illegal importation and exploitation of artworks. 10 The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State provides important support to the claims of States for violations of the aforesaid UNESCO Convention. In 2012, it allocated $6 million for 10 Article 6 reads: The States Parties to this Convention undertake: (a) To introduce an appropriate certificate in which the exporting State would specify that the export of the cultural property in question is authorized. The certificate should accompany all items of cultural property exported in accordance with the regulations; (b) to prohibit the exportation of cultural property from their territory unless accompanied by the above-mentioned export certificate; (c) to publicize this prohibition by appropriate means, particularly among persons likely to export or import cultural property. Article 7 reads: (a) To take necessary measures, consistent with national legislation, to prevent museums and similar institutions within their territories from acquiring cultural property originating in another State Party which has been illegally exported after entry into force of this Convention, in the States concerned. Whenever possible, to inform a State of origin Party to this Convention of an offer of such cultural property illegally removed from that State after the entry into force of this Convention in both States; (b) (i) to prohibit the import of cultural property stolen from a museum or a religious or secular public monument or similar institution in another State Party to this Convention after the entry into force of this Convention for the States concerned, provided that such property is documented as appertaining to the inventory of that institution; (ii) at the request of the State Party of origin, to take appropriate steps to recover and return any such cultural property imported after the entry into force of this Convention in both States concerned, provided, however, that the requesting State shall pay just compensation to an innocent purchaser or to a person who has valid title to that property. Requests for recovery and return shall be made through diplomatic offices. The requesting Party shall furnish, at its expense, the documentation and other evidence necessary to establish its claim for recovery and return. The Parties shall impose no customs duties or other charges upon cultural property returned pursuant to this Article. All expenses incident to the return and delivery of the cultural property shall be borne by the requesting Party. Article 10 reads: (a) To restrict by education, information and vigilance, movement of cultural property illegally removed from any State Party to this Convention and, as appropriate for each country, oblige antique dealers subject to penal or administrative sanctions, to maintain a register recording the origin of each item of cultural property, names and addresses of the supplier, description and price of each item sold and to inform the purchaser of the cultural property of the export prohibition to which such property may be subject; (b) to endeavor by educational means to create and develop in the public mind a realization of the value of cultural property and the threat to the cultural heritage created by theft, clandestine excavations and illicit exports. the conservation of artworks (not just within the United States) and another $1 million for training government agencies, including federal prosecutors. 11 Another important international convention likewise intended to combat the illegal trade in artworks is the UN Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects (UNIDROIT). Its preamble addresses the concerns over the illegal trade in cultural objects, 12 and requires Member States to establish common rules for restitution or repatriation for the return of the property illegally removed. Observe that the Convention requires the return even of articles acquired in good faith. 13 In the wake of recommendations contained in the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, drafted at the UNESCO General Conference on October 17-November 21, 1972, and dated 11/23/1972, 14 it became important for Governments to confer upon artwork \"a function in the life of the community\" (Article 5).",

The conclusion was made, however, that attempted crimes, or the potential for the same, must be reported in order to bolster the effectiveness of efforts to combat money laundering. There was, however, more clarity provided on the requirement that banks report suspicious activities \"for any reason\" because critics considered the expression overly broad and rendered meaningless the $5,000 threshold for Suspicious Activity Reports. The OCC decided that reporting was required on any operation involving $5,000 or more, provided the banks know, suspect, or have reason to suspect that the operation involves money derived from illegal activities; there is some intent to conceal or disguise the money; ",

It was embryonic to the ENCLA (National Strategy for the Fight against Money Laundering and Recovery of Assets), later renamed the National Strategy for the Fight against Corruption and Money Laundering (ENCCLA). The ENCCLA is made up of the primary agencies involved in the matter, which are the Office of the Attorney General, the Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF), the Justice Ministry's Asset Recovery and International Legal Cooperation Council Department (DRCI), the Federal Justice Council (CJF), the Office of the Federal Prosecutor (MPF), the Office of the Comptroller-General (CGU) and the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABin), annually setting policy for all actions to be carried out in the execution of Law No. 9613/1998, on account of private and uncoordinated-if not conflicting-agendas having been observed among government agencies responsible for said enforcement.
