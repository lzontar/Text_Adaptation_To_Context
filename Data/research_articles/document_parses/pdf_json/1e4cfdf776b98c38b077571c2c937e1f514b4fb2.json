The risk of contamination is high during dental radiography if proper disinfection techniques are not applied.

On the other hand, health care facilities are required to provide continuous service, treatment and relief for those in need and are rarely closed during any crises [3] . The primary route for transmission of virus is through droplets and aerosols and therefore dental health care workers are among the medical professionals who are at extreme risk of getting infected and further spreading the virus [4] [5] [6] [7] . The long and unpredictable incubation period (up to 27 days) [1] of the virus and the high rates of asymptomatic carriers (80%) [4] further challenges infection control measures during dental practice. There is no available universal guideline regulating the dental care provision during any epidemic or pandemic. However, dental pain is the most commonly encountered health problem among any given population and requires immediate care or treatment [8] . This is proven by the fact that the demand for urgent dental treatment decreased by only 38% since the beginning of pandemic in China [9] . It is evident that patients applying for dental emergency treatment will likely require dental imaging.",

Although panoramic radiography can substitute for intraoral radiographs during these difficult times, CBCT is associated with much higher radiation doses and should not be used as an alternative to intraoral imaging [13] . Additionally, there may be cases where dental practitioners require better radiographic image quality for a particular tooth (e.g. traumatized upper anterior incisor) or access to extraoral imaging techniques may not always be available, especially in low-and middle-income countries. In such, conditions intraoral imaging may be mandatory for dental practitioners.

A minimum of 1-min contact time with the disinfectant solution is advised. \u2022 Some disinfectants can be inactivated in the presence of organic material; therefore, the surfaces (especially hightouch surfaces, in case of blood, saliva or other bodily fluids) should be thoroughly cleaned with soap/detergent or water using mechanical action (scrubbing) prior to the use of disinfectants [23, 25] . \u2022 Cleaning equipment should be well maintained and the buckets containing detergent and/or disinfectant solutions must be discarded after each use in areas with suspected/ confirmed patients with COVID-19. Fresh solutions must be prepared on a daily basis or for each cleaning shift [23, 25] . \u2022 Spraying or fogging of certain chemicals (e.g. formaldehyde, chlorine-based agents) is not recommended for COVID-19.

If proper disinfection techniques is not applied when taking any dental radiograph, the potential for cross-contamination of radiographic equipment with blood and/or saliva would be significantly high [17, 18, 21] . Most reusable items used in dental radiology are considered semi-critical (contact with mucous membrane) or noncritical (contact with intact skin). Reusable semi-critic items such as bite guides, film positioning devices must be sterilized with high-level disinfectants after each use or covered with plastic sheets, wraps or pieces with adhesive edges, if sterilization or barrier-protection is not possible, then disposable items should be used [17, 18, 21] . Non-critical items such as chin rest, hand grasps can be barrier-protected and the covers must be changed after each patient. Surface barriers provide adequate protection while eliminating the need for clean and disinfect surfaces between patients [17] . Lead-apron and thyroid collars should be disinfected with a low-level disinfectant (e.g. quaternary ammonium compounds) and should be suspended on a coat hanger after each use. Attention should be paid to minimize the positioning and exposure errors during radiographic examination in order to eliminate the need for repeated exposures which may additionally increase the risk of contamination. The working station (computers, screens, scanners etc.) should be kept remote from the patient examination rooms and the operator in charge of exposures should have limited access to the working station or to the dark room. The radiologists should have a separate room to interpret images and prepare the reports. On the basis of experience with SARS, the use of a remote satellite radiography center or utilization of mobile radiographic equipment are also recommended for patients with known COVID-19 disease [28] .",

A cover sheet may be used as a physical barrier between the keyboard/console and the operator, in addition to low level disinfectant cleaning. If possible, a dedicated system (scanner and transducers) for COVID-19 positive or suspected patients should be used. Transducers should be cleaned after each examination with soap/water and low level disinfectant (quaternary ammonium) sprays or wipes. 2. Disinfection-As stated above, all internal transducers (e.g., intraoral, transesophageal) as well as intraopera-tive transducers require high level disinfection before they can be used on another patient. For disinfection, an antiseptic agent-impregnated towel (such as glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, ortho-phthalaldehyde, hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid, phenol/phenolate) as well as a type C ultraviolet light can be used [30, 31] .",

Intermediate level disinfectants (70% ethyl alcohol, 70% isopropyl alcohol) can be used for disinfection of these items on a daily basis or when contaminated [17, 18, 21] . \u2022 Paper towels should be kept ready over the counter in order to remove excess saliva after exposure. \u2022 Film/receptor holders (packed and sterilized) and film/ storage phosphor plates should be dispensed aseptically in a disposable container. \u2022 Plastic sheaths must be used for all kind of intraoral films/receptors and the integrity of sealed barrier must be verified before placement. The use of double barriers for films and plates and latex finger cots in conjunction with a plastic sheath for direct digital sensors will more effectively prevent cross-contamination [32, 33] . \u2022 If charged-coupled-device (CCD) sensors are used the cord must be wrapped with a plastic cover before placement and the cover must be changed after each patient [17] . \u2022 Following exposure, the plastic sheaths should be immersed in disinfectant solution and left to air dry. The sheaths must be opened carefully, hand contact with the film/receptor and contact with saliva must be avoided. While opening the protective cover, the films and phosphor plates should be allowed to drop out in a clean disposable cup and the cup must be held with clean gloves. Then, the film/plate can then be transferred to work station or dark room [17, 32, 33] Phosphor plates may also be gas sterilized with ethylene oxide [17, 32, 33] . \u2022 For conventional films, the operator in dark room must remove the film from the vinyl package without touching the film. The lead foil, black paper and the package should be discarded and film should be allowed to drop out on a clean disposable cup before manual/automated processing [17] . \u2022 Second hard copies of radiographic images should be avoided and teleradiology systems should be preferred to prevent contamination [14] .",
