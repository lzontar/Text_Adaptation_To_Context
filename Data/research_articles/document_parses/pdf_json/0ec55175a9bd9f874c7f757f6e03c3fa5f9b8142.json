Indeed, in response to influenza seasonal infection or vaccination, the majority of the induced antibodies are strain-specific. Current vaccine against the seasonal strains with the strategy of surveillance-prediction-vaccine does not cover an unmet virus strain leading to pandemic. Recently, antibodies targeting conserved epitopes on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein have been identified, albeit rarely, and they often showed broad protection. These antibody discoveries have brought the feasibility to develop a universal vaccine. Most of these antibodies bind the HA stem domain and accumulate in the memory B cell compartment. Broadly reactive stem-biased memory responses were induced by infection with antigenically divergent influenza strains and were able to eradicate these viruses, together indicating the importance of generating memory B cells expressing high-quality anti-stem antibodies. Here, we emphasize recent progress in our understanding of how such memory B cells can be generated and discuss how these advances may be relevant to the quest for a universal influenza vaccine.",

A, Immunodominant head-specific LLPCs and sub-immunodominant stem-specific memory B cells. The head region of HA contains epitopes that are immunodominant during infection or vaccination, while the stem region is subdominant. Antibodies against the head region have relatively higher affinity than those against the stem region and are usually strain-specific. The immunodominant head region-specific B cells differentiate into LLPCs. In contrast, the subdominant stem region-specific B cells become memory B cells that are potentially cross-reactive with other virus strains.

Once individuals are infected or vaccinated, antibodies against the head region are dominantly induced and continue to be produced. Those preexisting head-specific antibodies mask the HA head epitope in a subsequent challenge so that unmasked stem-specific B cells are able to respond and become memory cells (Scenario 2). Since several HIV and influenza bnAbs likely bind to self-antigens, those Abs are believed to be derived from a B cell repertoire with low affinity for self-antigens. Eventually, those B cells undergo SHM that triggers an override to recognize the stem region of HA. Those activated B cells can enter the memory pool (Scenario 3)",

Upon secondary vaccination, recall GCs were mostly derived from new naive B cells, but not from pre-existing memory B cells. 35 So, why then do pre-existing memory B cells, upon conventional vaccination, behave in a seemingly non-beneficial way for us ( Figure 4) ? First, previous transfer experiments demonstrate that memory B cells defined by surface IgG expression or by markers of more mature memory phenotype are prone to differentiate into plasmablasts, 36 rather than entering into GCs. Such types of memory B cells prone to plasmablasts might be preferentially activated, probably because of their higher affinity for the secondary antigen. Second, it is generally thought that memory B cells have higher affinity and are present at higher precursor frequencies than naive B cells specific for the same antigen. However, given that several different memory subsets coexist, only one of which has the propensity to enter GCs, the actual number of generated memory B cells capable of entering the GC might be small. In contrast, the number of naive B cells with sufficient affinity to enter a primary GC reaction is large. Hence, the precursor frequency of memory B cells capable of reentering GCs might be very small. Finally, in contrast to transfer experiments into naive mice, in non-transfer conditions, negative feedback by pre-existing and/or de novo generated antibodies might operate, which could limit GC entry of clones specific for epitopes targeted by these antibodies. It will be important to elucidate which mechanisms are predominantly responsible for the inability of memory B cells to reenter the GC.",

Antibodies directly target viruses and prevent their entry into the host cell by blocking the virus-host cell interaction (1) or membrane fusion (2) . Recent studies also demonstrated that some antibodies can inhibit the virus neuraminidase activity (3) critical for virus budding. 82 In addition, after virus infection, viral envelope proteins expressed on the infected cell surface are opsonized by antibodies. Effector cells, for example, NK cells, recognize these antibody-opsonized infected cells via their Fc receptors and then eliminate the infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity structure studies clearly showed the importance of conformation of the HA to fully induce broadly neutralizing and protective antibodies. Surprisingly, many of these stem-targeted bnAbs shared a common conformational epitope with C179. 11 Targeting this small region of the conformational epitope is a challenge for designing a stable vaccine antigen.",

            "text": "For immunogen design, two concerns exist. First, choosing an antigen epitope enabling induction of autoantibody had better be avoided. There exists a trade-off between autoreactivity and breadth of the cross-reactive antibody. Various BCR transgenic mouse studies of bnAbs against HIV demonstrated that bnAbs are autoreactive and designated to be inactivated by central tolerance. [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] In fact, Bajic et al 19 showed biochemically that 6 influenza bnAbs are poly-and self-reactive. Our recent investigation of one bnAb revealed that the bnAb-bearing B cell is self-reactive and targeted for receptor editing in vivo (unpublished results). Given these observations, we need to design an antigen able to induce antibodies that broadly neutralize virus entry and at the same time cannot be a target for tolerance. In the case of HIV, the b12 antibody seems to be in this category. 54 Second, as mentioned above in the mouse prime-boost model, only a minority of memory-derived clones reenter the GC, demonstrating that the constriction of the relatively divergent primary memory B cell repertoire takes place by boosting. 35 Therefore, in order to be efficiently targeted by sequential vaccination, an epitope should be rendered dominant from the beginning. Thus, efforts to target epitopes of interest by engineering high-affinity germline antibody-targeting immunogens 56 or occluding normally immunodominant regions 57 are needed.",

A unique feature of this virus is its diversity. Influenza viruses are mainly divided into two types, A and B. The more virulent type A can be further classified into 18 different hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes, theoretically 198 combinations (in fact 131 subtypes have been detected in nature). Type A influenza HA proteins are divided into two groups, group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, and H18) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, and H15), based on phylogenetic similarity (Figure 1). Not only that, what also makes it difficult to generate an effective vaccine is the fact that influenza viruses are constantly changing by \"drift and shift.\" As a result, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) was launched in 1952 and now includes over 150 institutions in more than 110 countries. The GISRS monitors the circulating influenza viruses year around and recommends the virus types, subtypes, lineages, and strains for the seasonal flu vaccine once a year. However, for making an annual vaccine, determining and targeting a specific virus strain, which is continuously changing, are not so easy. Although the vaccine effectiveness can differ from one subtype to the other and year to year, overall it ranges from 10% to 60% with an average of 40% between 2004 and 2019 in the United States (Past Seasons Vaccine",

            "text": "the strain bias. On the other hand, memory B cells have been speculated to express protective antibodies recognizing subdominant stem epitopes of drifted virus (Figure 3A). This idea was initially based on studies of the antibody response in humans to vaccination with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, which showed that individuals who had lower levels of pre-existing antibodies to this pandemic type virus generated broadly reactive anti-stem memory responses. Moreover, these antibodies of plasmablasts derived from several branches of the clonotypes' phylogeny over two consecutive years had undergone somatic hypermutation (SHM). 17 These observations suggested that those plasmablasts were activated from memory B cells. Supporting the collateral roles of memory B cells against drifted viruses, Purtha et al showed that mouse memory B cell responses to West Nile virus retain the ability to engage variant viruses, whereas antibody derived from LLPCs is poorly able to inhibit the variant viruses. More recently, mouse and human studies have further strengthened this concept. In a mouse model infection (Narita influenza infection followed by re-infection with Narita or PR8 virus), pre-existing antibodies secreted by LLPCs protected from the homologous challenge (Narita re-infection), whereas protection from heterologous challenge (PR8 re-infection) required memory B cell activation. These memory B cells were mostly GC-experienced and primarily directed toward the conserved HA stem regions. 20 In addition, human longitudinal studies of Dengue and Zika virus responses showed that memory B cell responses are more diverse (cross-reactive with both Dengue and Zika) than those of LLPC-derived antibodies. 21 Further question will be whether influenza HA stem-specific memory B cells can differentiate into LLPCs and secrete anti-stem antibodies for long time? Miller et al 22 performed a longitudinal study of serum antibody titers against HA stem. The titer increases over 20-year period. Further Nachbagauer also reported that the elderly had the highest antibody titers against the stem. 23 However, immunodominance of specific region of the HA such as head globular domain might interfere the anti-stem humoral responses upon conventional vaccination 17 as we discuss later.",

            "text": ", in the case of influenza, how do broadly reactive GC B cells enter the memory B cell pool, rather than the LLPC pool? While many previous GC studies have focused on understanding how the B cells undergo maturation toward the production of higher-affinity antibodies,24,25 there has been an increased realization that the GC responses simultaneously support the development of a diverse population of antigen-specific B cells. Excellent reviews have been published describing recent progress in GC biology,26,27 which are highly recommended to the reader.Considering these recent advances in GC biology, at least three non-mutually exclusive possible mechanisms for the generation of anti-stem antibodies can be envisaged (Figure 3B). First, since almost 100 clones are known to be able to enter the GC response in an individual GC,28 anti-stem B cell clones can have a chance to get into a GC. Because inter-clonal selection seems to be not so stringent during the early GC period, anti-stem GC cells could be maturated to some extent during the early time point. During GC reactions, memory B cells with not so high-affinity antibodies are preferentially generated at early time points,29,30 and these anti-stem GC cells are allowed to enter the memory pool during this time frame. According to this temporal model, at a later time point these anti-stem clones are outcompeted by immunodominant anti-head clones. Second, as another type of regulation, GC diversity may be promoted by antibody-mediated feedback, as dominant GC clones bearing antibodies specific for particular epitopes, for instance in the head region, give rise to plasma cells that secrete antibody that masks these epitopes, thereby enhancing the selection of clones that bind other epitopes, virus. A homotrimer shown as a sphere model. HA1 and HA2 are colored in green and blue, respectively. The other polypeptides of HAs are depicted as a ribbon model. Conserved amino acids among group 1 influenza viruses are colored in gold overlaid on the model on the left. Amino acids of the C179 binding region are colored in red. These views were generated by Protean 3D using the structure PDB 4HLZ for instance in an originally subdominant stem region. In this case, GC clones with anti-stem antibodies would not necessarily come up only at the early phase. Finally, as mentioned above, many of the unmutated germline ancestors of anti-stem antibodies are autoreactive.In this regard, studies of Sabouri et al have important implications.31 They showed that autoreactive GC B cells first acquire mutations that decrease their affinity for both the self-antigen and foreign antigen. This state may be positively selected during GC reactions, because the large decrease in receptor occupancy by self-antigen reciprocally permits increased uptake of the foreign antigen, thereby obtaining increased T cell help. Then, these GC cells might have a better chance to be recruited into the memory B cell pool.",

Ellebedy et al 33 sorted HA-specific plasmablasts at day 7 and HA-specific CD20 + memory B cells at day 14 (a mixture of CD21 lo and CD21 hi memory B cells). Both studies demonstrated some clonal overlap (~30%) between plasmablasts and memory B cells, indicating that an individual B cell clone can generate both plasmablasts and memory B cells. The clones found in day 7 HA-specific plasmablasts and day 14 HA-specific CD20 + memory B cells were present in the pre-existing memory B cell population, indicating that pre-existing memory B cells were indeed activated. Importantly, both studies showed no overall increase in SHM over time in these de novo generated plasmablasts and memory B cells after conventional vaccination. Differing from the above two human studies analyzing whole anti-HA B cells, Andrews et al traced specifically anti-stem human memory B cells using H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine for H7N9naive adults.",

In regard to the first issue, skewing to generating more GC-poised memory B cells seems to be difficult at present, because of the factors that control the formation of each memory B cell subset which will be an important challenge in this field now. For the second point, it is better to use only the target epitope of interest (occluding normally immunodominant regions) from the outset, thereby increasing the frequency of memory B cells bearing antibodies to the epitope of interest.

However, to what degree ADCC contributes to in vivo protection over neutralization activity in humans has not yet been determined. Another interesting question is whether the way an antibody recognizes antigen is also important to its ADCC function. Ravetch's group reported that bnAb targeting to the HA stem also carry out ADCC.38,39 Inducing these dual functioned antibodies by vaccination ideally would maximize the efficacy of a universal vaccine. Several structural studies of the protein complex of HA and bnAbs have been performed. Surprisingly, these antibodies, infrom humans and C179 10 from mouse, recognize a common structural epitope of the hydrophobic groove formed by the HA1 and HA2 domains. These findings clearly demonstrate that the area of the epitope with broadly neutralizing activity is very narrow. How can we induce activation of B cells harboring stem-specific antibodies? In the past, several attempts were made to develop a universal vaccine. In 1996, Sagawa et al 45 first expressed a headless HA (A/Okuda/57 (H2N2)) on CV-1 cells and used them to immunize mice. They could show limited cross-protection against influenza viruses A/FM/1/47 (H1N1). In 2010, Bommakanti et al 46 designed an HA2-based immunogen and showed cross-strain protection but not the cross-subtypic protection. In 2013, Palese's group generated a series of recombinant chimeric HAs with variable globular head domains and stem domains.",
