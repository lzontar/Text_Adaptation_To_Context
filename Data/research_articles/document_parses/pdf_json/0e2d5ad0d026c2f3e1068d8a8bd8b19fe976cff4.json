Emerging evidence has suggested that black and minority ethnic (BME) groups, particularly South Asian (SA) and black African or Caribbean (BAC) populations, are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and resulting complications 1 . Obesity is also associated with a higher risk of testing positive for, and dying from, COVID-19 1,2 . However, the interaction between ethnicity and obesity on the risk of COVID-19 has not been tested. As ethnicity is known to modify the association between BMI and cardiometabolic health 3,4 , we hypothesise that BMI also acts to modify the relative risk of COVID-19 across ethnic groups.",

Nonlinear interactions were investigated using restricted cubic splines with knots placed at the 33th and 66th centile of BMI distribution.

WE individuals with test data had a median (IQR) age of 71.3 (62\u00b73, 76\u00b71) years, BMI of 27\u00b76 (24\u00b78, 30\u00b79) kg/m 2 , and 2650 (49\u00b75%) were women. Comparatively, BME individuals were 64\u00b78 (57\u00b79, 73\u00b72) years old, had a BMI of 28\u00b72 (25\u00b72, 33\u00b71) kg/m 2 , and 136 (50\u00b72%) were women. The majority of the BME population (83%) were first generation migrants to the UK. BMI was associated with the risk of a positive test for COVID-19 in both BME and WE individuals. However, the dose response association differed by ethnic group (p for interaction = 0.05) (Figure) : in WE individuals, there was no additional higher risk of COVID-19 beyond a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 , whereas in BME individuals, the risk was greater for higher BMI values. Greater risk of COVID-19 in BME individuals relative to WEs was only apparent at higher BMI values (Figure) . For example, at a BMI value of 25 kg/m 2 , there was no difference in risk (OR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.52), whereas at a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or 35 kg/m 2 , the odds of COVID-19 were 1.75 (1.24, 2.48) and 2.56 (1.63, 4.03) higher in BME individuals relative to WEs, respectively.",
