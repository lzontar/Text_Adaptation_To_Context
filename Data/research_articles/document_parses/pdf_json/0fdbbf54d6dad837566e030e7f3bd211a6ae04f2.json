Here we report a universal solution: red blood cell (RBC)-hitchhiking (RH), in which NCs adsorbed onto the RBCs transfer from RBCs to the first organ downstream of the intravascular injection. RH improves delivery for a wide range of NCs and even viral vectors. For example, RH injected intravenously increases liposome uptake in the first downstream organ, lungs, by~40-fold compared with free NCs. Intra-carotid artery injection of RH NCs delivers >10% of the injected NC dose to the brain,~10\u00d7 higher than that achieved with affinity moieties. Further, RH works in mice, pigs, and ex vivo human lungs without causing RBC or end-organ toxicities. Thus, RH is a clinically translatable platform technology poised to augment drug delivery in acute lung disease, stroke, and several other diseases.",

Yet the theoretical concept of drug targeting, first proposed by Paul Ehrlich more than a century ago (his \"magic bullet\" theory), has run into numerous practical challenges 1 . Rapidly after injection, nanocarriers (NCs) inherently accumulate to very high levels in the liver and spleen, part of clearance by the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) 2 . Due to this and other unfavorable factors, NCs are not able to accumulate in many organs of therapeutic interest, most notably the heart and brain, organs whose pathologies cause the majority of the world's deaths. For example, current nanomedicine formulations achieve at best 1% of the injected dose (%ID) accumulating in the brain 3 . Affinity moieties such as antibodies have been proposed to increase target accumulation, but they have their own challenges, including unintended effects on host defense (caused for example by IgG multiplexed on NCs), the common necessity of switching affinity moieties between each species, and eventually humanization of affinity ligands. Overcoming these challenges with a technically straightforward and translatable approach for organ targeting of NCs remains the raison d'etre of nanomedicine research.",

Our goals were to move RH toward being a clinically useful platform technology by finding the optimal NC properties for RH, exploring the mechanism of the RH, determining if RH works in large animals and humans, and evaluating the safety of optimized RH. Perhaps more importantly, we sought to extend RH to not just target the lung, but any organ. In particular, we hypothesized that while IVinjected RH-NCs would accumulate in the lungs (the first capillary bed downstream of an IV injection), intra-arterially (IA) injected RH-NCs would accumulate in the immediately downstream organ. Such IA delivery of RH-NCs could treat two of the leading causes of cardiovascular death: heart attack and stroke. For severe heart attacks and strokes, it is standard of care to insert a catheter into the affected artery to remove flow obstructions, which helps, but still has poor patient outcomes. Therefore, we sought to determine if RH could be injected IA, as an IA catheter would already be in place during heart attack and stroke treatment.",

Additionally, acute critical illness affords unique delivery opportunities, with intravascular catheters commonly used in ways that are impractical for chronic illnesses.

After optimizing NC-to-RBC adsorption, we tested the efficacy of RH delivery to a target organ in mice to find the optimal NCs for RH. As seen in Fig. 2a , when injected IV, PS-NPs covalently coated with random IgG did not accumulate significantly in the lungs, but RH increased IgG-PS-NP lung uptake almost 20-fold and the lung-to-liver ratio more than 30-fold. Additionally, RH can augment lung uptake of PS-NPs coated with an affinity moiety. We tested PS-NPs coated with anti-PECAM-monoclonal antibodies, as such targeting epitopes have led to higher lung uptake of this type of NP than any other affinity moiety published to date 13, 24 . RH increased the lung uptake of anti-PECAM PS-NPs 2.6-fold, with concomitant marked reduction of hepatic uptake, Separate mice were injected with one of those two PS-NPs adsorbed onto RBCs (dark and light red, respectively). Mice were sacrificed 30 min later and I-125 activity in the organs was measured in a gamma counter. Displayed is the percent injected I-125 dose (%ID) for each organ. Inset: lung-to-liver ratios, which are calculated by dividing the lung's %ID per gram of tissue (%ID/g) by the liver's %ID/g. b %ID in the lung of different NCs labeled and injected as in a. c Lung-to-liver (left panel) and lung-to-blood (right panel) ratios of liposomes and nanogels, the two top performing lung-directed RH NCs. d Mice were injected with nanogels that were either uncoated (bare) or covalently coated with one of the three different antibodies (random rat IgG, anti-PECAM, or anti-ICAM) (blue bars). Other mice were injected with each of those four antibody-nanogel formulations adsorbed onto RBCs (red bars). Data are plotted as %ID per organ. Each data point represents mean \u00b1 s.e.m (n = 3). *P < 0.05, non-paired, two-tailed t-test resulting in almost an order of magnitude elevation of the lungto-liver ratio. The combination of affinity moiety plus RH thus increased the lung-to-liver ratio 760-fold over free IgG-PS-NPs ( Fig. 2a inset) . Thus, RH augments delivery of both untargeted and affinity targeted NCs, and the combined approach has a strong cumulative effect. We next screened a variety of NPs for their effectiveness in RH. When injected IV, RH augmented lung uptake in the case of every NC tested (Fig. 2b) . The fold improvement of lung uptake provided by RH over free NCs ranged from~4-(albumin-NPs) to~40-fold (liposomes), with the NCs with the lowest elastic modulus, and liposomes and nanogels having the highest values. Two key variables for determining the effectiveness of a targeting modality are the fold improvements conferred by targeting on the target organ-to-liver and target organ-to-blood ratios. For liposomes, the RH improvements in the lung-to-liver and lungto-blood ratios were 116\u00d7 and~50\u00d7, respectively, while RH nanogels achieved values of 15\u00d7 and 27\u00d7 (Fig. 2c) .",

Thus, RH nanogels can achieve very high uptake without the use of affinity moieties.

LPS markedly increased the leukocytes (Fig. 4h, left panel) and edema-related protein in the alveoli (Fig. 4h, right panel) , but the addition of RH did not lead to any change in these sensitive inflammatory markers. c Macrophages were plated in flow chambers and NGs (labeled red) were introduced, either free or adsorbed onto RBCs (labeled green). As seen in two separate experiments using RH NGs (top two panels), the RH NGs (red) localize to the center of the macrophages, and the RBCs (green) transiently localize on the periphery of the macrophages. In two other experiments using free NGs (bottom two panels), very little NG signal localizes with the macrophages. Scale bars represent 20 \u03bcm. In the rightmost panel, we have quantified the gain in macrophage-co-localized red fluorescence (corresponding to nanogels) during the course (10 min) of each of these experiments. Each data point represents mean \u00b1 s.e.m (n = 4 for free NG, n = 12 for RH NGs); *P < 0.05, non-paired, two-tailed t-test RH works in multiple species. With the safety of RH verified in mice, we sought to determine if RH worked in larger species. It was possible that RH only worked for the particular RBC and capillary properties found in mice. Therefore, we began by testing the first step of RH, NC adsorption onto RBCs. NC adsorption worked with mouse, rat, pig, and human RBCs, though with a range of adsorption efficiencies (Fig. 5a ).",

That lung-to-liver ratio was 17-fold higher than that seen with free NCs; an RH-to-free proportionality similar to the proportionality seen in mice ( Fig. 2c ).

Within 12 h of organ donor death, we endovascularly cannulated subsegmental branches of the pulmonary artery (Fig. 5d, left panel) . Into one such artery, we infused both I-125-labeled NCs adsorbed onto RBCs and I-131labeled NCs that were \"free\" (not adsorbed onto RBCs), followed by a green tissue dye to mark the infused tissue and prove perfusion to a single lung subsegment (Fig. 5d, right panel) . The reason to inject both the RH and free NCs into the same artery is that co-injection into a single vessel controls for differences in quality of endovascular cannulation/vessel isolation, and the fact that ARDS pathology is patchy, which can affect NC uptake 30 .",

These PE model mice were also injected with either saline, free reteplase-NGs, or RH reteplase-NGs. As seen in Fig. 6c , the amount of clot in the lungs (I-125) is the same for mice receiving either saline or free reteplase NGs, but RH reteplase-NGs show 16 times lower levels of I-125 in the lungs. As would happen with clot dissolution, as opposed to dislodgement of clots, the blood levels of I-125 fibrin/fibrinogen were markedly higher in mice that received RH reteplase-NGs. We quantified the fraction of initial PE (clot in the lung) that dissolved over 1 h, and found that saline and free-reteplase had the same low level of clot dissolution (performed by endogenous mechanisms), while RH-reteplase dissolved nearly 100% of the initial PE (Fig. 6d) .

            "text": "The first organ we chose for IA RH was the brain, which we targeted via injection into the right internal carotid artery, which is the smallest artery branch feeding the brain that we could cannulate in a mouse (Fig. 7a, inset) . As seen in Fig. 7a 's left panel, RH achieved a brain uptake of 11.5% of the injected dose (%ID). More impressively, the brain-to-liver ratio of RH was 14.3, which was 143-fold higher than that for free NCs (see Supplementary Fig. 1) . Similarly, the brain-to-blood ratio of RH was 27-fold higher than for free NCs (Fig. 7a, right panel) . To determine where in the brain the RH NCs localize, we injected I-125-labeled RH NCs and then prepared slices of the mouse's brain that were imaged with visible light and autoradiography. Figure 7b shows that the right side of the brain receives significantly more delivery than the left, and that the distribution within the brain varies in correlation with defined anatomical substructures. To further localize the RH NC delivery, we performed a similar experiment to autoradiography, but injected RH NCs that were labeled with rhodamine and performed immunofluorescent microscopy. Numerous puncta were seen in Fig. 4 Optimized NCs do not cause toxicity during RH. a Mouse and human RBCs were mixed either with an agglutinating cross-species serum (dog serum) or NCs and then prepared as a \"thin smear\" slide. Dog serum causes RBCs to aggregate, as do bare PS-NPs, but nanogels do not. Scale bar represents 30 \u03bcm. b Round-bottom well assay of RBC aggregation, in which aggregated RBCs form a diffuse haze, while non-aggregated RBCs settle into a tight red dot. c RH nanogels, with the RBCs labeled with Cr-51, were prepared as in Fig. 2 and injected into the mice, followed by sacrifice after 30 min and organ Cr-51 signal measurement on a gamma counter. As a positive control, RBCs were intentionally aggregated with the anti-RBC antibody, Ter119, plus a cross-linking secondary antibody. Each data point represents mean \u00b1 s.e.m (n = 3). d, e RH nanogels and Ter119-aggregated RBCs were prepared as in c, but before sacrifice, the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was measured. Five min after injection, Ter119-aggregated RBCs (positive control) had increased the PAP, while RH nanogels had not (quantification in e). Each data point represents mean \u00b1 s.e.m (n = 4). f, g Mice were injected as in c and then had their blood oxygen measured over time (f), followed by their sacrifice at 30 min for histology (g), showing no difference between RH and RBCs-only. Scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm. Each data point represents mean \u00b1 s.e.m (n = 4). h Mice were injected with RH or free nanogels and intratracheally instilled with LPS, followed by measurement of the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) levels of leukocytes and protein, both measures of lung inflammation and ARDS. Each data point represents mean \u00b1 s.e.m (n = 3). *P < 0.01, non-paired, two-tailed t-test the brain, again more on the right side of the brain than left (Fig. 7c) . Finally, we performed H&E staining of those brain sections, which showed that the right hemisphere of the brain showed no morphological difference than the left, suggesting no major, acute toxicity (Fig. 7d) . Therefore, collectively these data show that an IA injection can safely deliver NCs to the brain at levels markedly above prior technologies.",

We showed that optimized RH formulations can safely and powerfully target NCs to chosen organs via select placement of intravascular catheters, without the need for an affinity moiety, across multiple animal species including humans. The magnitude of organ targeting for optimized RH significantly outperforms that of prior affinity-targeting approaches. For example, anti-PECAM antibodies have been used for >20 years to target IV-injected~100 nm NCs to the lungs with fairly impressive targeting 13 . In the present study, however, anti-PECAM-nanogels had a lung-to-liver ratio 14.6\u00d7 lower than that achieved by RH-nanogels without an affinity moiety. RH's advantage over prior technologies is even more pronounced in the context of cerebrovascular targeting. The best brain-targeting affinity moiety published so far is transferrin, which when highly optimized only delivered 1% of the injected dose (%ID) to the brain 3 , compared to RH-nanogels, which produced a brain uptake of~12% ID. These order-of-magnitude advantages of RH should greatly improve the risk-benefit ratios of delivered drugs.",

We provided the first experimental support for this mechanism by showing via histological analysis that RH NCs are indeed found inside the capillary endothelial cells in the lungs. Surprisingly, we also found that in pathological tissue, RH also delivers NCs to intravascular leukocytes that reside in the capillaries. Consistent with this finding, in vitro Fig. 7 IA injection of RH NCs results in high NC uptake in any downstream organ. a Mice were anesthetized and had their right internal carotid artery cannulated to deliver the injectate to the brain (inset).

For example, viruses or other pathogens may adsorb onto RBCs, as we observed with AAV, and then get taken up by the next organ to which they are presented. Notably, the NCs used here are in the same size range as most viruses (e.g., AAV is 25 nm and HIV 120 nm). Indeed, pathogens have been intentionally attached onto RBCs using specific antibodies, and these pathogens are then transferred to the liver 8 . The lung, as the first capillary bed after entry of a NC or pathogen into a vein, may have similarly evolved the function of taking up RBC-adsorbed pathogens as a defense mechanism to protect other downstream organs. Indeed, even though IA RH provides unprecedented delivery to the immediately downstream organ, the lung still gets a disproportionate amount of RH NCs after IA injection (Supplementary Figure 1) . Such data intriguingly suggest that perhaps the lung has evolved to be especially adept at receiving RH pathogens and NCs. These data also imply that IA RH should focus on drugs that do not have pulmonary toxicity. Future studies can elucidate the role of RBC adsorption and RH in pathogen uptake into organs.",

RH's nano-micro-macro synergy provides tremendous target-organ specificity by focusing on delivery of NCs on the \"first-pass\" of the injectate through an organ. Such a system is now very practical for the most common acute, severe diseases. In severe heart attacks and embolic strokes, standard of care is to insert an IA catheter for removal of the flow blockage, thereby easily allowing IA injection of RH NCs. For the most common severe acute lung disease, ARDS, which accounts for 10% of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, only an IV catheter is needed, which all such patients have in place. That means RH is well poised to serve as the delivery modality for the three most important acute, severe illnesses. For these acute applications, there will likely not be time to cross-match the blood, so RH will utilize universal donor blood (O-negative), which is currently used for emergent bleeding standardly in all hospitals. Notably, such intravascular catheters are not practical for most chronic, outpatient-treated diseases, and thus RH development should focus on acute, critical illnesses. However, another major application, which also will utilize directing RH into macro-scale catheters, is delivery into transplanted organs to deliver ischemia-reperfusion-injury drugs. Thus, RH has the potential to provide a drug delivery platform for multiple common diseases that currently lack effective therapies.",

The lungs were first inflated with low pressure oxygen and the main bronchus clamped. Pulmonary artery subsegmental branches were endovascularly cannulated, and then sealed to the artery opening with tissue glue composed of 30% bovine serum albumin (BSA) mixed at 1:1 with glutaraldehyde, thus preventing retrograde efflux of solutions injected into the artery branch. The pulmonary veins were also cannulated to aid with efflux of solutions that flowed through the lungs. The lungs were then perfused with 3% BSA in PBS at 25 cm H 2 O pressure. We then injected into the artery, via its sealed catheter, I-125-labeled nanogels that were adsorbed onto human RBCs, and then flowed into the catheter 3% BSA-in-PBS through for 5 min. We then injected into the same artery I-131-labeled nanogels that were not adsorbed onto RBCs. We then ran 3% BSA-in-PBS through for 5 min. Finally, we injected a green tissue dye. The entire lung lobe was then dissected into 2 mL segments, which were analyzed for green dye intensity and measured in a gamma counter. We analyzed the green regions which were perfused by the chosen subsegmental artery separately, and the entire lobe collectively.",
