These interventions have had an impact on the decline of the Re of COVID-19 in Bali to 1.4, translating to a longer doubling time. However, assuming this outbreak is occurring via community spread [11] , the modeling results imply that numerous COVID-19 cases will occur in Bali. Predictions of the outbreak trajectory and forecasting of demand for health facilities, particularly ICUs, have also been conducted in Italy, where they were proven to be correct in the following days [12] . Thus, without increasing the intensity of interventions at a larger scale, the capacity of health services will not be sufficient to handle the thousands of COVID-19 cases that will require treatment at hospitals and especially in ICUs. On the peak day, the number of severe cases is estimated to be approximately 6105, of which 1831 will need ICU beds. With the current bed and ICU availability, the healthcare system is in danger of collapse. Serious efforts are needed to improve CO-VID-19 preventive interventions and to prepare the healthcare system in Bali as much as possible.",

First, to reduce the proportion of the susceptible population, we suggest that the government of Bali should tighten the implementation of social restrictions and examine the possibility of implementing large-scale social restrictions, known as PSBB in Indonesia. PSBB could be implemented at the district and provincial levels with approval from Ministry of Health of Indonesia. The key components of PSBB are the closure of schools and working facilities (including factories), restriction of public activities (including religious ceremonies), restriction of public transportation, and other restrictions (including defense and security activities). An additional component of PSBB is the ability of local government to deploy law enforcement [13] .",

This includes increasing the capacity of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests, at least for screening exposed populations [15] , such as those catego-rized as people under monitoring (known as ODP in Indonesia) and asymptomatic close contacts, as well as travelers and Indonesian migrant workers. The government of Bali is currently screening migrant workers using a rapid antibody test, and additional consideration should be given to false negatives, the exact timing of testing, and improving quarantine procedures involving district governments in Bali. It is also paramount to tighten air and sea entrances, because there is a high risk of imported transmission from other red zone areas on other Indonesian islands, where screening and quarantine procedures also need to be applied.",

A report from Italy revealed that 8.4% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were healthcare workers at hospitals [3] .

Furthermore, solid partnerships between the private and public sector should be formalized, as only 2 private hospitals in Bali are currently prepared to provide care for COVID-19 patients. The provincial government should categorize current COVID-19 referral hospitals according to the level of supporting technology and health personnel capacity, and should play a role in designing referral flow and procedures. In addition, mapping the availability of health workers with special qualifications needed for COVID-19 services and mobilizing them effectively for COVID-19 case management in Bali are paramount in preparing the healthcare system for the increase in severe and critical cases. These improvements in hospitals' capacity will require planning and financing for the recruitment of qualified human resources [16, 17] .",
