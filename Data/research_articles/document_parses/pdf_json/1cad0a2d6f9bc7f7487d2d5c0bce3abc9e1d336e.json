(1) With almost 3 million confirmed cases globally, (2) countries around the world are pinning their hopes on testing as part of their exit strategy from more severe measures. This includes antigen testing, which tests if people currently have COVID-19, and antibody testing, which tests if people have had COVID-19 in the past. However, the World Health Organization has warned against using antibody tests in order to issue people with \"immunity passports\" due to fears that those who test positive for antibodies may stop adhering to protective measures. (3) People who believe they have had COVID-19 may be more likely to think they are completely immune, stop engaging in protective behaviours such as handwashing and reduce their social distancing measures. This may contribute to transmission of the virus for two reasons. First, test results can be wrong (4) and in the absence of testing people can misdiagnose themselves: this can lead people to believe that they have had COVID-19 when they have not.
