            "text": "Why some individuals resist infection or recover quickly, whereas others experience severe disease associated with infection, is a fundamental question that medicine has struggled to answer. Pathogens and host immune factors have been extensively investigated for many infectious diseases, to address these questions. However, limited information is available concerning the influence of host genetics on the response to viral infections. Genetic determinants have the potential to play a role at numerous points during the course of viral infection, including viral attachment and entry, replication, disease progression and development of severity, and, finally, transmission. In this issue of the Journal, Albright et al. [1] propose that the severity of influenza illness may have a heritable component. To investigate this hypothesis, the authors used as a resource the Utah Population Data Base, which contains data from founding families and their descendants, comprised primarily of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (i.e., Mormons), thus representing a relatively ethnically homogeneous population.",

Singlenucleotide polymorphisms in TLR genes are not uncommon and vary among populations [8] . TLR4 has been implicated in the innate immune response to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, and polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene have been associated with severe bronchiolitis in RSV-infected infants, although the significance of the Asp299Gly polymorphism appears to be a matter of ongoing debate [9 -12] . A missense mutation in the TLR3 gene (F303S) conferring loss of function in in vitro assays has been identified in a Japanese child with influenzaassociated encephalopathy [13] . Interestingly, better survival rates have been demonstrated for TLR3 knockout mice than for wild-type mice, despite the TLR3 knockout mice having higher lung virus titers after influenza virus infection [14] . TLR genes (in particular, TLR3) would therefore be worthy candidate genes to investigate. In addition, RNA helicases, such as retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), recognize double-stranded RNA and, thus, contribute to the antiviral state of an infected cell [7] . Inhibition of RIG-1 by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus antagonizes interferon (IFN) production and is a means by which the virus evades the host immune system [15] . Therefore, the RIG-I gene should also be considered to be a candidate for attempts to elucidate aberrations in the immune system that may lead to severe influenza illness.",

Mannose-binding lectins are part of the innate immune system, binding pathogenassociated carbohydrates and activating the complement system through the classical pathway. Mutations within the MBL gene have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [18] .

The outcome of influenza illness is likely to be dependent on environmental, nutritional, demographic, immunological, and (especially) virologic factors. Undoubtedly, host factors, including comorbidities, will also have a bearing on outcome, and the relative contribution of different genetic determinants is likely to vary depending on environmental and virologic contexts. A significant proportion of the data collected in this study emanates from the influenza pandemic of 1918, which occurred in a setting very different from that of interpandemic cases. In addition, the use of death certificates imposes significant limitations. During the 1918 pandemic, anyone dying with respiratory symptoms was likely to have been given a code denoting \"pneumonia and influenza,\" which introduced a potential bias. One could argue that errors related to certification of death would be random rather than systematic and should have minimal bearing on the results. Nonetheless, death certificates are notoriously inaccurate, and the absence of microbiological and/or serologic data is a significant limitation of this study.",

[1] are that heritable factors for severe influenza illness may well exist and that elucidation of these factors remains a challenge. Identification and characterization of genetic determinants of the outcome of infection with influenza virus would lead to further insight into the pathophysiology of the virus and its immune evasion strategies. One would hope that this insight would translate into identification of prognostic factors and improved management of individuals at risk for adverse outcomes after influenza virus infection. Identification of genetic determinants of outcome after influenza virus infection would require a substantial number of severe cases of influenza (in which severity of illness is not the result of other factors, such as underlying cardiovascular disease) to gain sufficient power and produce interpretable data. Resources stemming from the sequencing of the human genome are now available and render this challenging task more feasible. Such approaches as the genomewide and candidate gene study designs are reviewed by Burgner et al. elsewhere [22] . The latter approach may be more feasible, given the growing knowledge regarding IFN antagonism and immune evasion by influenza viruses. One must bear in mind that findings may not apply across all host or virus populations. In the event of a pandemic, however, early identification of and intervention for individuals at higher risk for severe illness and death resulting from influenza due to a predisposing genetic determinant would be invaluable.",
