The spatial disparity in the uptake of BEVs across the different regions is analysed using historic BEV sales. A forecast for future growth in BEVs (ignoring the impact of Covid-19) is performed using an s-curve model. Currently, South East England and Greater London have the highest BEV sales as a percentage of new vehicle sales. The spatial distribution of EV chargers across the different regions is also analysed. The spatial analysis clearly shows the regional disparity in the uptake of EV. South East England has the highest number of public chargers excluding Greater London. However, if we consider the number of EVs in that region, it has the secondlowest ratio of approx. 1 charger per 10 BEV. The lowest ratio being 0.8 in the West Midlands.",

Until recently, the focus has been decarbonisation of the electricity sector. However, since 2016, the transport sector is the largest emitting sector. It contributed up to 28% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the UK as of the end of 2018 as shown in Figure 1 [2] . For the UK to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, it is highly important to decarbonise the transport sector. The vehicle-based options for decarbonisation of the transport sector include electrification (battery electric vehicles), fuel cell vehicles (hydrogen fuel) and synthetic fuel-based internal combustion engine [3] .",

Therefore, Electric vehicles have received a significant push from governments across the world, not just in the UK. An electric vehicle is one that uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for force. There are two types of EVs: all-electric vehicles (AEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). AEVs include both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Table 1 shows the commitments to end the sales of conventional vehicles in different countries with Norway leading the path with a ban that is effective by 2025. This paper aims to provide an overview of the spatial variation of the EV adoption and availability EV infrastructure across the UK. ",

To promote the adoption of EVs, the UK government provided a grant of \u00a35000 for the first 50,000 cars or until 2017 whichever was sooner [5] . This grant has since been reviewed and revised. From October 2018, only the purchase of vehicles with emissions of less than 50 g/km and a zero-emission range of at least 70 miles are eligible for grant funding, which was reduced from \u00a34,500 to \u00a33,500. The Department for Transport (DfT), UK and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), UK publish historic values of registered vehicles by postcode districts and battery electric vehicles by local authority [6] . Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of BEV sales as a percentage of new vehicle sales in that region using this data. From the figure, it can be observed that South East England and Greater London has a much higher percentage of BEV sales than the rest of the country.",

The challenges of using an s-curve for forecasting are discussed in detail in [8] . Finding the best fit s-curve for EV growth is equivalent to finding the best fit line on a set of log axis as described in [9] . A similar approach is used to forecast the expected growth in EV sales and the resulting graphs for Oxfordshire and the UK are as shown in Figure 3 . Historic quarterly data of vehicle sales and registered vehicles provided by DfT and DVLA during the period March 2011 to March 2020 is used to do the s-curve fitting. It is expected that more than 80% of the new vehicle sales in the UK will be BEVs by 2030 whereas Southeast England and London would have crossed that mark approx. five years earlier. Figure 4 shows the year at which the percentage of EV sales will be 50% of the new vehicle sales in the respective region. From the figure, it can be observed that if the current trend continues, Southeast England and Greater London would cross the 50% mark almost a decade before Northeast England highlighting the need for further actions to promote BEVs in these regions. This also implies that the effect of EV charging will be felt in the electricity distribution networks in some regions earlier than others. ",

In March 2020, this grant scheme was updated to continue for one more year albeit at a reduced grant of \u00a3350 instead of \u00a3500 per home chargers and workplace chargers.
