It provides complex clinical services including; the state adult burns service, state heart and lung transplantation, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and other haematology and oncology services, renal transplantation, specialist medical and surgical departments, mental health and state rehabilitation service, as well as maternity, paediatric and neonatal services. The Pharmacy Department provides a wide range of services via inpatient pharmacy, outpatient pharmacy, compounding pharmacy, clinical pharmacy, clinical trials and special access scheme pharmacy and pharmacy stores. The clinical pharmacy service is provided 7 days a week.

This pharmacist position works 38 hours per week on weekdays, taken from a pool of 4 trained pharmacists, plus a limited after-hours service on weeknights and weekends. The COVID pharmacist attends ward rounds, practices partnered charting and has faced challenges such as anticipated medical staff shortages, the storage of medications bought in by COVID-19 infected patients, the limited availability of clinical trial medications, intentionally limiting contact between infected, or potentially infected patients, and clinical healthcare workers and significant language barriers.",

Drug-food interactions (e.g. meals reducing the absorption of tacrolimus) and strategies on how to manage these are communicated with clinical staff.

If brought in, they are stored in locked bedside drawers in the patients' room to prevent contamination of clean areas whilst providing medication security and preventing medication self-administration. This allows continued medication reconciliation on discussion with the patient, although the containers cannot be physically inspected.

The COVID pharmacist is responsible for advising on therapeutic substitution of locally available therapeutic alternatives when prescribed medications are not available. Challenges of recommending medication substitutions includes having to select an alternative medication which has the same therapeutic effect, an acceptable side effect profile, no clinically significant interactions, be cost-effective and ideally with a longer halflife to reduce nursing contact frequency with the infected patient.",

The latest published guideline details definition of disease severity, monitoring and markers of clinical deterioration, recommendations around management with antivirals and other disease-modifying treatments, respiratory support and the use of steroids for people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease infected with COVID-19 [13] . National guidelines do not support the use of antivirals and other disease-modifying treatments in treating COVID-19 patients due to lack of evidence, however, do promote their use in context of clinical trials [13] . The state-wide antimicrobial stewardship body (WA Committee for Antimicrobials) recommended in a position statement publicised to all WA healthcare institutions, that medications which have been publicised as having antiviral in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ ritonavir should not be used for off-label pharmacotherapy unless the patient is enrolled in an approved, randomised, controlled clinical trial such as The Australasian COVID-19 trial (ASCOT) trial or the Randomised, Embedded, Multifactorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) trial [14, 15] At our institution, COVID-19 related clinical trials are managed on the ward by the clinical investigators specific for each trial with support from the pharmacy department clinical trial team. Therefore, it is essential that the COVID pharmacist keeps informed with the latest trials and medication management around COVID-19 to provide clinical and logistical support.",
