These patients were all related to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market. 1 Wuhan Health Commission announced an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan on December 31, 2019. On January 8, a Novel Coronavirus was officially announced as the causative pathogen of the outbreak by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Human-to-human transmission of the virus has explained most infections. 2 At present, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases has been reported in many countries of the world, 3 -6 causing a serious social burden and a public health emergency of international concern declared by the World Health Organization. 7 Asymptomatic infected persons or asymptomatic period before the onset of the cases are not easy to identify so it is easy to cause omission, but the epidemiological significance cannot be ignored. Now the transmission capacity of cases as source of infection during the asymptomatic period (incubation period) is not well known. This manuscript reported a cluster of the COVID-19 caused by incubation period transmission in Wuxi, China to provide some basis for scientific investigation of close contacts and other practical work.",

At the same time, when the county (district) CDC receives reports of suspected, confirmed and asymptomatic cases of the COVID-19 from medical institutions or medical personnel within the jurisdiction, as well as the cluster outbreak, they should complete the epidemiological investigations within 24 hours in accordance with \"Epidemiological Investigation Plan for the COVID-19 Cases \". The investigation includes the basic information of the cases, the onset and treatment, the risk factors and exposure history, and laboratory tests. The medical institutions that treat the cases are responsible for collecting the related specimens of cases, including upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, fecal or anal swab specimens, blood specimens, etc. The medical institutions that can detect the nucleic acid for the COVID-19 virus first perform nucleic acid detection and the results are reviewed by Wuxi CDC. The medical institutions that cannot perform the test are sent to Wuxi CDC for testing. We collected the required data from \"Public Health Emergency Reporting Management Information System\", epidemiological questionnaires for the cases, and laboratories.",

Moreover, case B denied any history of contacting with other persons with fever or respiratory symptoms during the trip to Japan, and no symptoms were found in other members during the trip.

In addition, we extended the interval of transmission to others before onset, for the first time, confirmed that it was infectious 9 days before the onset, which was different from previous reports on infectivity during the incubation period. A research, published on January 30, reported that an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus infection occurred in Germany and the patients were exposure to the index patient during her incubation period and 2 days before the onset. 8 Yu P et al. reported a familial cluster of infection associated with the COVID-19 virus, showing that a person might be infected during the incubation period of other cases, but this was not confirmed. 9 A family cluster was also reported in Nanjing (Jiangsu, China), describing that the cases were infectious during the incubation period. However, its transmission algebra was not as large as this manuscript, and the confirmed infection period before the onset was not as long as this manuscript. The article of Nanjing did not describe the contact with other involved patients after the onset of the source of infection. 10 Tong ZD et al. reported a 2-family cluster in Zhejiang, China. The source might be that a family member of each of the two families had a history of meeting and dining together with a confirmed Wuhan person. A telephone epidemiological investigation was conducted on the Wuhan person and he said he developed symptoms after returning to Wuhan. The article did not confirm that the cases were infected during the incubation period, given that the Wuhan person might have slight unreported symptoms and recall bias as well as the uncertainty of the source of the two-family clusters being the Wuhan person. 11 However, our manuscript clearly confirmed that the incubation period was infectious, and the transmission ability was not weak, that the transmission could involve four generations, and also confirmed, for the first time, that it was contagious 9 days before the onset of illness.",
