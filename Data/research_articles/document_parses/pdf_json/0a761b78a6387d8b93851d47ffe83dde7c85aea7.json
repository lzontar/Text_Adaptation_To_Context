One month after lockdown commenced (T2), we assessed 30 psychological and behavioural traits in 4,000 twins in their mid-twenties and compared their responses to the same traits assessed in 2018 (T1). Mean changes from T1 to T2 were modest and inconsistent: just as many changes were in a positive as negative direction. Twin analyses revealed that genetics accounted for about half of the reliable variance at T1 and T2. Genetic factors correlated on average .86 between T1 and T2 and accounted for over half of the phenotypic stability. Systematic environmental in uences had negligible impact on T1, T2 or T2 change. Rather than the crisis fundamentally changing people psychologically, our results suggest that genetic differences between individuals play a fundamental role in shaping psychological and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 crisis.",

COVID-19 disease can be a life or death issue for those infected with the virus, but the psychological responses of those infected and of the many more people in lockdown who had not contracted the disease are also of concern. For example, a recent review of 24 studies on the effects of quarantine concluded that 'the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging, substantial, and can be long lasting' (Brooks et al., 2020) . Low mood and irritability stood out with an incidence of 73% and 57%, respectively, but negative effects were also found for diverse measures including stress, anxiety and insomnia, with some indication of long-term effects such as post-traumatic stress and drug abuse. Also, many studies have found increased posttraumatic stress symptoms following natural disasters such as earthquakes and man-made disasters such as terrorism (Furr et al., 2010) .",

However, the crisis is likely to affect individuals differently, possibly even including some people whose psychological health is improved by the crisis. An important issue is that the causes of mean differences can be unrelated to the causes of individual differences. For example, the cause of mean changes before and after the COVID-19 crisis can safely be attributed to the environmental effects of the pandemic and lockdown. However, this does not imply that differences in pandemic experiences are the sole source of individual differences in response to the crisis. Importantly, the way in which individuals react to the same event can depend on their genetics.",

We operationalised change by regressing T1 scores from T2 scores so that T2 scores are independent of scores at T1, which we refer to as 'change scores'.

The twin design can be used to distinguish systematic environmental in uences attributable to growing up in the same family, called 'shared' environmental in uences, from other environmental in uences (Plomin & Daniels, 1987) . Despite a century of the 'nurture assumption' in which the family was assumed to be the major systematic source of environmental in uence (Harris, 1998) , shared environmental in uences are generally negligible, and especially as young adults leave their family and make their own way in the world (Plomin, 2018) . This is the rationale for our hypothesis the such shared environmental in uences will have negligible impact at both T1 and T2 as well as for change from T1 to T2 (Hypothesis 6). Although environmental effects are substantial, our hypothesis is that the environmental effects that make a difference are largely 'nonshared', idiosyncratic and unsystematic (Plomin, 2018) .",

As explained in Methods, the model yields estimates of the extent to which the phenotypic correlation between T1 and T2 is accounted for by A, C and E. The genetic correlations are shown in the top panel of Figure 5 (See Supplementary Figure 2 for shared environmental and non-shared environmental correlations). The results of the Cholesky bivariate analysis are illustrated in the bottom panel of Figure 5 , with details in Supplementary Tables 16-21 . Genetics accounts for 55% of the T1-T2 phenotypic correlations on average. Shared environment accounts for 4% of the phenotypic correlations on average. E in uences shared at T1 and T2 are responsible for the rest of the phenotypic correlations (40%), which could be stable non-shared environmental in uences or correlated error. The Cholesky model also estimates A, C and E components of variance at T2 independent of their respective A, C and E components of variance at T1.

As explained in Analyses, the Cholesky model estimates the genetic contribution to phenotypic stability from T1 to T2, which includes the genetic correlation. The genetic correlation is the correlation between genetic effects at T1 and T2 independent of the T1 and T2 heritabilities. The genetic correlations averaged 0.91, and most of their 95% con dence intervals included 1.0, indicating that genetic effects at T2 were substantially correlated with genetic effects at T1, despite the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown.",

However, this possible effect of shared environments might be a genetic effect in disguise because identical twins locked down together more often than nonidentical twins (32% vs 25%). Results of univariate model-tting separately for twins locked down together vs apart ( Figure 6 ) are consistent with the notion that the apparent effect of shared environments might be mediated in part genetically (Supplementary Table 26 -27 for model-tting results including the 95% con dence intervals). For T2 scores, twins together yielded a slightly higher average estimate of shared environmental in uence compared to twins apart (.07 vs .03), suggesting some very slight increase in true shared environmental in uence. However, twins together also yielded a slightly higher average estimate of genetic in uence compared to twins apart (.33 vs .30), which could be the result of genetically in uenced selection for being locked down together, which would be an example of gene-environment correlation. However, a great deal of caution is warranted in these interpretations because the difference in phenotypic correlations for twins locked down together vs apart is not signi cant and our design has negligible power to detect signi cant differences of this magnitude for A and C. Power to detect signi cant differences for such small effects is negligible. Nonetheless, further support for the hypothesis that the apparent C effect of being locked down together is not really C comes from nding nearly identical A and C estimates pre-existing at T1: A and C are .33 and .06 for twins together and .30 and .03 for twins apart. Results of T2 change scores provides additional con rmation in that a similar pattern emerged: A and C are .19 and .04, respectively, for twins together and .14 and .02 for twins apart.",

With our large sample size, nearly all variables show signi cant mean differences, but they don't make much of a difference, accounting for less than two percent of the variance on average. Another reason might be methodological. In the present study we did not focus on participants' subjective reports of how the COVID-19 crisis changed them. Instead, at T2, we asked participants to report, for example, how depressed they felt during the month following lockdown, which we compared to their reports of depression on the same measures in 2018.

The frequency of those reporting that they were moderately, very, or extremely worried was 38% for physical health and 57% for mental health. In other words, they were, quite reasonably, worried, although on average they did not change psychologically, including their symptoms of general anxiety. This can be viewed as a hopeful message that young people on average, are resilient psychologically to an experience as seismic as COVID-19 and lockdown, although these mean differences mask individual differences to the COVID-19 and lockdown.

In other words, of the total variance at T1 and T2, about 40% can, on average across the measures, be attributed to genetic factors, about 30% to non-shared environmental factors, and about 30% to unreliability of measurement. Shared environmental in uence has negligible impact.T2 change scores show lower heritabilities, 16% on average. Because T2 change is a residualised score independent of scores at T1, stable genetic in uence from T1 to T2 is removed from T2 change scores.Thus, heritability of T2 change scores represents novel genetic in uence at T2 that does not affect T1. Shared environment, which includes not only shared rearing environment (the twin pairs grew up together in the same family) but also shared experiences during the COVID-19 crisis, has negligible effects on T2 change, 3% on average. Most of the variance of T2 change scores is due to the E component of variance, 81% on average. We cannot separate E of T2 change scores into non-shared environment and unreliability of measurement because test-retest reliability at T1 cannot be assumed to represent the reliability of T2 change scores.Univariate model-tting results. These results about variance and covariance gleaned from the twin correlations are highly similar to the results of univariate model-tting analyses of variance for T1, T2 and T2 change measures, as shown inFigure 4. (SeeSupplementary Table 15for model-t statistics, precise ACE estimates and con dence intervals.) The average model-tting heritability estimates were 32% for T1, 32% for T2 and 15% for T2 change. Model-tting estimates of shared environment were 3% for T1 measures, 3% for T2 measures and 2% for T2 change measures. Average model-tting estimates of E were 66%, 65% and 82%, respectively.",
