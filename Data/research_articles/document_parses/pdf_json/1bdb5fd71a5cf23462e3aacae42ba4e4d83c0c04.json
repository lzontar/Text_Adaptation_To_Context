The alveolar region is bounded by the pleural space, which separates it from the chest wall and the diaphragm. The alveolar region is connected to the external environment through the airways which divide into the upper airway, the collapsible airway and the small airways. The alveolar pressure PA, the collapsible pressure PC, the pleural pressure Ppl and the pressure generated by the muscles Pmus are referred to the environmental pressure Pref. The transmural pressure Ptm is the difference of pressure between the pleural space and the collapsible airway. The elastic recoil of the lung Pel is the difference of pressure between the pleural space and the alveolar region. The elastic recoil of the chest wall Pcw is the difference of pressure between the pleural space and the chest wall. Pext is the external pressure at mouth. In normal breathing it equals Pref (27) and generates the pleural pressure of the quiet breathing by applying a gain g and a vertical offset voff to the output P.
