Healthcare personnel (HCP), on the other hand, continue to serve on the front line. With their being a limited, human resource, it is paramount that the safety of HCP is not compromised 1 . At our health service in Victoria, Australia, we have implemented a human factorcentric education model with the aim to maximise safety through key messages and clear communication. The importance of cognitive aids for education of HCP is important to maximise their safety. As countries transition to an endemic phase of COVID-19 and the rate of asymptomatic carriage increases, we aim to use these aids to reduce danger to HCP, patients and the community. We believe it is important to reinforce the need to consider all potential dangers when managing COVID-19 patients (\"The D (danger) comes first\"). The DRSABCD mnemonic actively used in critical care and resuscitation is displayed to relay the acuity of the situation 3 . This will encourage the health care team to respond (\"R\" in DRSABCD) appropriately by applying PPE.",

The reinforcement of adherence to PPE and double-checking PPE fit with a co-worker minimises risk a virus transmission to other HCP and patients.

A recent study identified suboptimal hand hygiene and long duty hours as risk factors for COVID-19 transmission to HCP 5 . Therefore, one must consider other factors apart from PPE to prevent transmission of COVID-19. The use of easily identifiable infographics with simple and consistent shift briefings allows for the rapid communication of information to HCP across multiple hospitals, whilst maintaining message recognition. A culture of safety and confidence amongst HCP during this pandemic will not only ensure their safety, but also that of their patients and the community.",

Reinforce the importance of identifying the virus as the predominant danger 2. Include personal protective equipment (PPE) in response to danger 3. Focus on hand hygiene 4. Reinforce social distancing 5. Encourage HCP wellness and teamwork 6. Maximise communication, ensure understanding, and provide an opportunity for feedback and questions",
