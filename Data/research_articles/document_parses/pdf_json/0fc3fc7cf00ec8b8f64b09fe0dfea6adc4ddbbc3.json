Abstract The etiological agents involved in a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) outbreak were investigated in a dairy heifer calf rearing unit from southern Brazil. A battery of PCR assays was performed to detect the most common viruses and bacteria associated with BRD, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were taken from 21 heifer calves (symptomatic n = 15; asymptomatic n = 6) that, during the occurrence of the BDR outbreak, were aged between 6 and 90 days. At least one microorganism was detected in 85.7% (18/21) of the BALF samples. Mixed infections were more frequent (72.2%) than single infections (27.7%).

Antimicrobial drugs used in calves (spectinomycin and tulathromycin) are commonly used in Brazil for BRD treatment. However, these drugs were not used as metaphylaxis and/or therapy in the early stages of BRD, which increased the success of treated calves [24, 60] . In association with this condition, potential risk factors for BRD previously described were detected at the rearing unit [12, 13, 61] . This unit includes automatic milk feeders with a common nipple, large group pens (>12 calves), older calves housed with younger calves, and calves from various sources with unknown sanitary status. bovis isolated from young cattle in France revealed that 100% of recent strains are resistant to common antibiotics used to control BRD [62] . Thus, it may be suggested that when calves are challenged with so many etiological agents and in the presence of risk factors, simple maternal immunity and broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs may not be sufficient to control BRD in calves. However, an essential tool for prevention is the use of commercial vaccines against the main pathogens that cause respiratory, bacterial, and viral diseases. These vaccines should be administered mainly to cows in the final period of pregnancy, to promote the transfer of immunoglobulins by colostrum. In addition, it is essential to ensure the intake of an adequate amount of colostrum soon after the calves are born. Finally, all preventive measures together can help to reduce the number of susceptible animals and the excretion of microorganisms, in addition to reducing the risk of BRD occurring mainly in the
