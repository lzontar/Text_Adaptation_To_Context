Confirmed 2019-nCov-infected cases were identified in Dongyang and were treated according to guidelines for the diagnosis of 2019-nCov infection released by the National Health Commission. Information regarding the contacts that the infected people had was collected to determine whether it caused clustered cases. A series of successive nucleic acid examination of feces, oropharyngeal swabs, and sputum was also performed, and the results were analyzed. A total of 19 confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection were identified in Dongyang, Zhejiang Province, China. Five cases showed severe symptoms, and the remaining ones showed mild manifestations. Ten cases infected from two asymptomatic individuals were clustered into two groups. Among 14 cases with consecutive nucleic acid test results, four patients showed positive results in feces after their negative conversion in oropharyngeal swabs. Asymptomatic individuals with the virus could cause 2019-nCov clustered cases, and the clustered cases may differ from sporadic cases on age and length of hospitalization. In addition, nucleic acids in feces last longer than those in oropharyngeal swabs.",

However, some cases showed negative results for the nucleic acid detection test, indicating the necessity of combining the diagnosis with computed tomography scans [14] [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, emerging results show that results from nucleic acid tests differ among different clinical specimens, including oropharyngeal swabs, feces, urine, and blood [14] . Due to the limited results on consecutive sample collection of nucleic acids in clinical specimens [18] , it is difficult to evaluate the persistence of the virus from the onset of the disease to the healing stage using different clinical specimens. e high infectivity of 2019-nCov has been indicated by high control reproduction number and explosive growth of confirmed cases in China [3, 19] . Once the respiratory infection symptoms are manifested with suspicious contact history, the suspected individuals were isolated, protecting the susceptible population from the virus infection [20] . However, asymptomatic individuals carrying the virus exist, and they cannot be discovered until other individuals in close contact with the asymptomatic one become ill, potentially resulting in a cluster of infection or familial infection as reported [21] . erefore, a detailed examination regarding the contacts that the infected people have had should be conducted in a community with cases of viral infection to isolate the virus carriers on time and prevent further transmission.",

Fortunately, only 6 cases from Wuhan tested positive and 13 other cases were infected because they had contacts with the confirmed cases. e people with whom these patients had contact have been traced and their consecutive nucleic acid examination during hospitalization was performed and reported in this study. e initial model predicting the transmission ability of 2019-nCov revealed that the virus has high infectivity, which is supported by our results that two strains caused 10 confirmed cases in our region [19] . When individuals with the virus could not be managed well, it resulted in clustered cases [21, 23, 24] . Without any intervention for prevention or control, the number of incidences would be much higher than that we detected. e accurate identification of individuals with the virus could be achieved by presenting a detailed history of the contacts they had, nucleic acid test, and even CT scan in highly suspected individuals [25] . Once the aforementioned history is complete, an essential intervention including isolation and diagnosis should be performed. Furthermore, the efficient control of transmission is largely dependent on the interventions of the governments, including any forbidden outdoor activity and strict self-isolation, which have been proven to be quite useful in preventing the explosive growth of cases [26, 27] . Daily fever surveillance in the community and nucleic acid testing among suspected individuals provide a timely diagnosis of 2019-nCov infection. e existence of viral RNA in clinical specimens provide the clinicians sufficient evidence to diagnose 2019-nCov [13] . However, negative results have been reported in individuals who show typical pulmonary infection by CT imaging examination. e virus amount in clinical specimens varies along the process of the disease, showing fluctuations between negative and positive results in oropharyngeal swabs in our study. Delay in negative results in feces compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs during convalescence has been reported in a previous study, suggesting that nucleic acids in feces last longer than those in oropharyngeal swabs, which is also observed in our study [18] . Indeed, nucleic acids in feces or urine indicate that excrements from confirmed cases should be carefully managed. Virus could be spread through close contact and air-borne droplets from cough or sneeze, while other transmission routes such as fecaloral transmission have not been confirmed [28] . However, nucleic acids in feces specimens last longer than those in oropharyngeal swabs in our study and others, indicating that fecal-oral route transmission should be reconsidered and reevaluated in a further study [18] . In this way, the diagnosis and discharge from the hospital based on nucleic acid detection may be modified according to different clinical specimens. e limitation of this study is represented by the limited number of confirmed cases. However, the limited number of cases allows tracing them more easily and the transmission path between the cases can also be analyzed more easily. Findings of this study might help clinicians and researchers in evaluating the transmission ability of 2019-nCov and the appropriate sample to be used to assess the presence of viral nucleic acids.",
