It was declared to be a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO) [1, 2] . About 14% of the cases develop severe disease and 5% require admission to intensive care unit [3] . Although some medicines are under research, currently, no specific antiviral drug has been approved to target SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2] . Moreover, giving corticosteroid to a patient with lung injury caused by COVID-19 remains controversial [4] . Owing to the absence of specific antiviral drugs, it is wise to search and try other alternative strategies to treat COVID-19. CP is a classical immunotherapy which has been used in the management of several infectious diseases for many decades. It was fruitfully used in the treatment of 2009 H1N1, SARS, MERS [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2, serum ferritin was 746 ng/ml. The patient was admitted in the corona isolation unit center (CIUC). He received Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg b.i.d) and Azithromycin (500 mg q.d.). The patient's condition progressed, on the second day, he developed dyspnea (respiratory rate: 35 breaths/minute), oxygen saturation was 80%, temperature: 39.5 C, arterial blood gases (ABG) on room air showed PaCO2: 23 mmHg, PaO2: 57 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 114 mmHg. Chest x-ray showed right upper zone ground glass opacity with small area of consolidation. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed small subpleural ground glass opacity (GGO) affecting both lower lobes and right upper lobe. The patient was put on noninvasive oxygen therapy, Meropenem vial (1 g t.i.d.), Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg b.i.d) and Kaletra tablet (Lopinavir/Ritonavir 800/200, b.i.d), and enoxaparin (4000 IU q.d.). After 3 days, the patient did not respond to the management strategy and deteriorated more and more. The dyspnea increased, (Oxygen saturation 60% without O2, became 90% on 10 L O2 through nasal cannula), bilateral diffuse course crackles, temperature 39.5 C, ABG on 10 L O2 through nasal cannula showed PaCO2: 33 mmHg, PaO2: 58 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2: 96 mmHg, serum ferritin: 1074 ng/ml, ESR: 91, D-dimer 1140 ng/ml, C-reactive protein (CRP): 37 mg/dL, with normal troponin test. CT scan showed diffuse bilateral GGO and multiple areas of consolidation in different regions of the entire lung (Fig. 1) . Despite his treatment, the patient received 200 ml of CP from a previously recovered moderate COVID-19 patient after performing necessary investigations for donor plasma (hemoglobin level and viral screen). The patient started to improve clinically, 4 days later, he was quite stable, no dyspnea, oxygen saturation on room air reached 95%, and the chest x-ray resolved partially. The patient was discharged from the hospital 16 days after admission in a healthy condition without symptoms, chest examination was clear, no significant radiological findings on chest-x-ray, and there were three consecutive negative RT-PCR tests each with at least 24 h apart.",

Hematological tests and chest x-ray were normal, RT-PCR for nasopharyngeal swab was negative despite increase in severity of cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Four days later, RT-PCR became positive for SARS-CoV-19. The patient condition progressed, on sixth day of hospitalization, he had dyspnea, fever, cough, tachycardia and hypoxia with diffuse bilateral crepitation on chest examination; oxygen saturation: 80% increasing to 90% on 8 L of oxygen, respiratory rate 40 breaths/minute, temperature 39.5C, PaO2: 61 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2:122 mmHg on 10 L O2 through nasal cannula, alveolar-arterial gradient: 65. CBC showed lymphopenia, serum Ferritin: 650 ng/ml, CRP: 45 mg/dL, ESR: 91. Chest-x-ray revealed bilateral lower zone infiltration and haziness, chest CT scan showed left upper lobe ring shaped consolidation surrounding small area of GGO (reverse Halo sign or Atoll sign), bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral diffuse lower lobe GGO (Fig. 2) . The patient was put on non-invasive oxygen therapy, Meropenem vial 1 gm t.i.d., Tamiflu tablet 75 mg b.i.d., Kaltetra tab 400/100 mg b.i.d., hydroxychloroquine tablet 400 mg b.i.d. for the first day, and 200 mg b.i.d. subsequently, Enoxaparin 4000 IU q.d. subcutaneously, acetaminophen bottle on need, Valsartan tablet was replaced with Amlodipine tablet.

In addition to his medications, the patient received 200 ml of CP from a previously recovered COVID-19 patient after doing necessary investigations for donors plasma (hemoglobin level and viral screen). Seventy-hours later, the patient started to improve, fever subsided, dyspnea decreased, lymphocyte counts normalized. Six days after the plasma transfusion, D-dimer 1887 ng/ml, PaO2: 81 mmHg, PaO2/ FiO2 = 162 mmHg on 10 L of nasal cannula oxygen. Chest x-ray showed improved consolidation and GGO, CT-scan showed disappearance of the pleural effusion.

The lack of well-conducted clinical trials undoubtedly contributes to the uncertainty to practice this management strategy.

CP has the benefit that while it halts the viral replication by its antibodies, other components can likewise apply valuable effects such as refilling of the consumed coagulation factors. The problem with CP is that it demonstrates individual dependent variableness in antibody titers and specificities while H-Ig preparations hold standardized doses of antibody [2] .
