In this study, a rapid isothermal real-time 3 reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was 4 developed for the detection of SFTSV. The detection limit at 95% probability was 241 5 copies per reaction. A test of 120 serum samples of suspected severe fever with 6 thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) patients revealed that the sensitivity and 7 specificity of the RT-RPA assay was approximately 96.00% (95%CI: 80.46%-99.79%) 8 and 98.95% (95% CI: 94.28%-99.95%), respectively; the kappa value was 0.9495 (P 9 \uff1c0.001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 87.50% of the different data points 10 were located within the 95% limits of agreement, indicating a good correlation 11 between the results from RT-RPA assays and those of RT-qPCR assays. In conclusion, 12 the rapid and efficient RT-RPA assay can be a promising candidate for point-of-care 13 detection method of SFTSV. 14 15 Keywords: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus; Recombinase 16 polymerase amplification; Detection assay 127 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and incubated at 128 39 \u00b0C for 30 min. Optimal reaction conditions were defined after testing different 129 incubation temperatures (37 \u00b0C, 38 \u00b0C, 39 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C, 41 \u00b0C), as well as different 130 primer concentrations (150 to 600 nM) and exo-probe (50 to 150 nM). 131 The fluorescence signal was collected in the FAM-Channel (excitation 488 nm and 132 emission 520 nm) once every 30 s. The threshold time of each sample, representing 133 the time a reaction needed to generate fluorescence signals that exceeded the 134 threshold, was recorded.

Discussion 228 SFTS is an acute infectious disease with a high case fatality rate [6]. The most 229 commonly seen clinical manifestations of SFTSV infection, including fever, 230 thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia, are often unspecific and need to be 231 differentiated from other infectious diseases, such as haemorrhagic fever with renal 232 syndrome, human anaplasmosis [6, 14]. A recent study showed an increasing 233 Figure 2. Bland-Altman analysis of SFTSV RT-RPA assays and RT-qPCR assays. Mean of difference between results from RT-RPA assays and RT-qPCR assays is indicated with the red line. The 95% limit of agreement was indicated with the blue lines. incidence of SFTSV-specific antibody seropositivity among healthy people in high 234 endemic areas of China, suggesting the existence of asymptomatic SFTSV infections 235 [15]. Human-to-human transmission through blood and/or body fluid contact or 236 aerosols and resulting multiple cluster cases have also made SFTS a threat to public 237 health [16, 17]. Therefore, a rapid detection method is in urgent need for early 238 diagnosis of SFTSV infection to improve clinical outcome and prevent transmission. 239 Currently, the diagnosis of SFTS is based on serological methods and PCR-based 240 viral nucleic acid testing [14]. However, specific antibodies to SFTSV are detectable 241 after about 7 days from disease onset [18], and PCR-based nucleic acid tests usually 242 require a centralized laboratory with high-end instrumentation and skilled personnel 243 to perform. The novel RT-RPA technique might be an ideal candidate for point-of-care 244 detection of SFTSV. 245 This study established a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic approach for the 246 detection of SFTSV nucleic acids in clinical serum specimens. The detection limit of 247 SFTSV RT-RPA assay was statistically estimated as 241 copies of target RNA per 248 reaction, which is consistent with other published literature [19-21]. While the 249 sensitivity of this RT-RPA assay is lower in conventional RT-qPCR for SFTSV, the 250 detection limit is still far below the viremia level in most clinical SFTS patients [18]. 251 With the application of RT-RPA, the detection time was reduced to < 30 minutes, 252 whereas RT-qPCR generally takes > 1.5 hours. In addition to the reduced detection 253 time, the constant reaction temperature of 39 allowed RT-RPA assays to be 254 performed using simple equipment such as a water or metal bath, while RT-qPCR 255 requires sophisticated thermocyclers. The short detection time and isothermal reaction 256 condition therefore provided the RT-RPA assay with advantages over RT-qPCR as a 257 point-of-care detection assay in resource-limited areas.

Only two samples 219 failed to produce consistent results. The RT-RPA-positive but RT-qPCR-negative The clinical performance of this RT-RPA assay was also proved to be satisfactory 259 using a series of clinical serum samples. The sensitivity and specificity are 260 comparable with other established detection methods [10, 11, 22-25]. One 261 RPA-negative sample was positive by nest-PCR. The sequencing result of the 262 RPA-negative sample revealed that there were several mismatches within the binding 263 sites of the probe and the reverse primer. Previous study, regarding foot-and-mouth 264 disease virus and human immunodeficiency virus, indicated that perhaps as a result of 265 the length of primer and probe compensating for mismatches in target sequence, RPA 266 can tolerate up to nine mismatches across the primer and probe binding sites [26, 27]. 267 However, in our study, one mismatch is located next to the fluorophore-modified 268 nucleotide of the probe. Due to its location, it might hinder recognition of the 269 tetrahydrofuran spacer by the double-strand-specific endonuclease IV and subsequent 270 separation of the fluorophore/quencher complex, thereby, leading to significant 271 reduction of fluorescence signal in the RT-RPA assay. Several studies also observed 272 that mismatches covering the center and both extremities of the primer sequence 273 would hamper RPA reaction [28]. Mismatches of probe show greater negative impact 274 on the efficiency of RPA reaction than the primer, and RPA reaction efficiency 275 decreases as the number of mismatches increases on the probe binding site [29]. Our 276 SFTSV-specific probe and primers successfully distinguished target pathogen from 277 fifteen other pathogens, exhibiting high specificity for SFTSV.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Therefore, the RPA technique can probably be integrated into the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms and pathogen-differentiating diagnostic methods, like the SHERLOCK detection platform, combining RPA with CRISPR-Cas13a, does in detecting Dengue or Zika virus ssRNA as well as mutations [30].improved in further studies. The RNA extraction method used in this study to process serum sample still require much effort and heavy centrifuges, which might hamper the practicality of this assay in point-of-care settings. Magnetic bead-based methods[21]    or one-step RPA microfluidics [31] could be employed to simplify the sample preparation process. In detection of clinical samples, the RT-RPA assay has a certain probability to produce false-negative results[32]. To improve the clinical sensitivity of RT-RPA, investigation into the influence of the amount and distribution of mismatches on RPA and the employment of degenerate primers [33] is in need.Besides, with better fluorescence detection equipment, this technique can be integrated into a phone-size portable device and be easily used for field detection in SFTS-prevalent areas.In conclusion, as shown in this study, we developed a rapid isothermal detection method for SFTSV with high sensitivity and specificity. The RT-RPA assay can be a suitable choice as a point-of-care detection assay for SFTSV.We would like to thank Prof. Bo Dai (University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai) for providing technical help, as well as Prof. Lingyun Shao (Huashan hospital, Shanghai) for proofreading the manuscript.This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of Foundation of China (No. 81201306); the Thirteenth Five-Year National Science and Technology Major Project for Infectious Diseases (No. 2017ZX10305501-002); and Municipal Science and Technology Project of Zhoushan (No. 2016C11001, No. All aspects of this study were performed in accordance with national ethic regulations and approved by the ethics committee of Zhoushan Hospital [(2016) approval No. 361 [8] Y.
