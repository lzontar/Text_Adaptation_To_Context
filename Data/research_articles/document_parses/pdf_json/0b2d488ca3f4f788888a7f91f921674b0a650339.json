In most cases, infection is limited to the upper airways resulting in no or only mild symptoms. Severe disease is caused by viral dissemination to the lungs ultimately resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death. The airway epithelium acts as a frontline defense against respiratory pathogens, not only as a physical barrier and through the mucociliary apparatus but also via its immunological functions 1 . The epithelial lining fluid is rich in innate immunity peptides and proteins with antibacterial and antiviral activity, such as lysozyme, lactoferrin or defensins 2 . Currently, our knowledge about innate immune defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract is very limited.",

Here, we set out to identify factors of the respiratory tract that inhibit SARS-CoV-2. For this, we extracted polypeptides from 6.5 kg of homogenized human lung or 20 liters of pooled bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and separated them by chromatographic means. The corresponding fractions were added to Caco2 cells and infected with pseudoparticles carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 9 . None of the fractions of the lung library suppressed infection (Extended Data Fig. 1a ). In contrast, fractions 42-45 of the BAL library prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle infection almost entirely (Fig. 1a) . The antiviral effect was comparable to that of 10 \u00b5M EK1, a spikespecific peptide fusion inhibitor used as control 10 (Fig. 1a) . Titration of BAL fractions 42 to 45 onto Caco2 cells confirmed that they prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles in a dosedependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 2 ).",

As shown in Fig. 1b , sub-fractions 42_4 to 42_9 and 42_57 reduced, and sub-fraction 42_55 almost completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticle infection. Analysis of these inhibitory fractions by gel electrophoresis showed distinct protein bands in sub-fractions 42_55 and 42_57, whereas no peptide/protein was detectable in sub-fractions 42_5 to 42_7 (Extended Data Fig. 3 ). The most active sub-fraction 42_55 contained a prominent band at ~ 52 kDa, which was also detectable in other active fractions but hardly present in those showing no antiviral activity (e.g. 42_49) (Extended Data Fig. 3 ). This band was excised from the gel and subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS revealing a 100 % sequence identity to \u03b11-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) (Extended Data Fig. 4 and extended Table 1 ), a 52 kDa protease inhibitor 11 . The presence of \u03b11-antitrypsin (\u03b11-AT) in inhibitory fractions 42_55 and 42_57 was confirmed by Western Blots with an \u03b11-AT-specific antibody (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). To test whether \u03b11-AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used a commercially available \u03b11-AT preparation from human blood (Prolastin\u00ae). Camostat mesylate (CM), a small molecule inhibitor of the spike priming protease TMPRSS2 was included as control 9, 12 . \u03b11-AT and CM both suppressed SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticle infection of Caco2 cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ~ 2 mg/ml for \u03b11-AT, and ~ 0.05 \u00b5M for CM, respectively (Fig. 1c) . Cell viability assays showed that \u03b11-AT displays no cytotoxic effects at concentrations of up to 8.2 mg/ml, whereas CM reduced cell viability at concentrations of 200 \u00b5M, due to DMSO in the stock (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). The antiviral activity of \u03b11-AT and CM was specific for the corona virus spike because infection of pseudoparticles carrying the G-protein of VSV was not affected (Fig. 1c) . These data suggest that \u03b11-AT may inhibit an early step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. In fact, time of addition experiments showed that \u03b11-AT blocks infection if added to cells 1 to 4 hours prior to or during SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection (Fig. 1d ) , but not if added 2 hours post infection (Extended Data Fig. 7 ).",

For this, we assessed survival rates of Vero cells infected in the absence or presence of EK1, CM or \u03b11-AT. In the absence of drugs, infection by both SARS-CoV-2 isolates resulted in a massive virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and reduced cell viability by about 80% (Extended Data Fig. 8 ). Microscopic evaluation revealed the absence of CPE in the presence of high concentrations of the compounds (not shown). MTS assays confirmed a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell killing and viral replication by EK1 and CM (Extended Data Fig. 8 , Fig. 1e ) with average IC50 values against both SARS-CoV-2 isolates of 2.81 \u00b1 2.52 \u00b5M for EK1, and 3.62 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5M for CM, respectively (Fig.  1e) . Strikingly, \u03b11-AT suppressed the French SARS-CoV-2 isolate with an IC50 of 0.58 mg/ml, and the Dutch strain with an IC50 of 0.81 mg/ml (Fig. 1e) . Almost complete rescue of cell viability was observed at \u03b11-AT concentration of 2-4 mg/ml (Extended Data Fig. 8, Fig. 1e ).",

A recent preprint publication suggests that \u03b11-AT may suppress the spike protein priming protease TMPRSS2, similar to Camostat mesylate 16 , however, evidence that \u03b11-AT indeed inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection was lacking. Our results using pseudoparticles and replication-competent virus are in line with this observation, because \u03b11-AT prevents an early step in the viral life cycle, and selectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 spike but not VSV-G mediated infection, which is independent from TMPRSS2 activation 17 . Thus, similar to Camostate mesylate, \u03b11-AT may inhibit TMPRSS2-mediated priming of the Spike protein, thereby preventing engagement of the ACE2 receptor and subsequent fusion.",

To this end, 36 \u00b5l of CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega G3580) was added to the medium and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. Then, optical density (OD) was recorded at 620 nm using a Asys Expert 96 UV microplate reader (Biochrom). To determine infection rates, sample values were subtracted from untreated control and untreated control set to 100%.",

Cells were expanded in a T75 flask (Sarstedt) in Airway Epithelial Cell Basal Medium supplemented with Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium SupplementPack (both Promocell). Growth medium was replaced every two days. Upon reaching 90 % confluence, HAECs were detached using DetachKIT (Promocell) and seeded into 6.5 mm Transwell filters (Corning Costar). Filters were precoated with Collagen Solution (StemCell Technologies) overnight and irradiated with UV light for 30 min before cell seeding for collagen crosslinking and sterilization. 3.5 x 10 4 cells in 200 \u00b5l growth medium were added to the apical side of each filter, and an additional 600 \u00b5l of growth medium was added basolaterally. The apical medium was replaced after 48 h. After 72 -96 h, when cells reached confluence, the apical medium was removed and basolateral medium was switched to differentiation medium \u00b1 10 ng/ml IL-13 (IL012; Merck Millipore). Differentiation medium consisted of a 50:50 mixture of DMEM-H and LHC Basal (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium SupplementPack and was replaced every 2 days. Air-lifting (removal of apical medium) defined day 0 of air-liquid interface (ALI) culture, and cells were grown at ALI conditions until experiments were performed at day 25 to 28. To avoid mucus accumulation on the apical side, HAEC cultures were washed apically with PBS for 30 min every three days from day 14 onwards.",

CaCo2 cells were treated for indicated hours with \u03b11-AT and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles. e) \u03b11-AT and controls block SARS-CoV-2 infection of TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 cells.

Seventy-three reversed-phase chromatographic fractions of 50 ml were collected to constitute the BAL peptide bank, from which 1 mL-aliquots (2 %) were lyophilized and used for antiviral activity testing. For further purification of active fractions, a second reversedphase C18 HPLC 4,6x250mm column (Phenomenex 00G-4605-EO) at a flow rate of 0,8mL/min with gradient program (min/%B):0/5 50/60 60/100 was used.",
