A major effect of it has been seen in the health sector worldwide, due to the unpreparedness for such an event. Lockdown and social distancing, though necessary non-pharmacological measures to flatten the transmission curve, have further aggravated the interruption of health care services to the needy. Worse survival has been reported in oncology patients during the COVID crisis, due to their compromised immunity, which could be disease or anticancer treatment-related. As a considerable fraction of patients visiting the health care institute are oncology patients, interruption of health care services during the crisis might delay treatment in these patients.",

A significant proportion of time is usually consumed in primary (interval between symptom onset to the first visit to the clinician) and secondary delay (interval between clinician visit to start of treatment) in a majority of oncology patients awaiting treatment, especially in low-middle income countries (LMIC) with huge patient burden. Since time factor is an important element in oncology treatment, delivering optimal care during the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging event. As oncology care hangs on a fine-scale balance amidst the COVID pandemic, striking a balance between delivering or delaying treatment during this crisis, becomes crucial not only for oncology patients but also for the treating clinician. Various factors contributing to treatment delays, its possible impact on the oncology patients and clinicians' role during the COVID-19 crisis, is henceforth worth discussing and needs to be highlighted.",
