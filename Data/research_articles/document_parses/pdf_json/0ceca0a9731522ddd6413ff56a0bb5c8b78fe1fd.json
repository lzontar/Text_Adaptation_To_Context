Since the alveolar epithelial cells have a high propensity of ACE2 receptors, they are the most adversely affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The devastating cytokine explosion attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to severe shock, oedema and multiple organ failure. Administering the COVID-19 patients with an infusion of multipotent MSCs can help to combat the COVID-19 as these cells will inhibit the exaggerated immune response and encourage endogenous repair of the lung epithelial cells by improving the microenvironment.",

The virus mainly targets the pulmonary epithelial cells as it's initial site of infection by letting its surface spike protein interact and bind to the host ACE2 receptor. The internalization and gradual replication of the virus results in an exaggerated immune response triggering release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This immune storm is responsible for multiple health hazards in the host ultimately leading to multiple organ failure. Mesenchymal J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f stem cell therapy offers a promising approach towards mitigating the delirious effects of the infection in the COVID-19 patients. This therapy has shown to reduce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as repair of damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients.

Accessory therapeutic manueveurs including corticosteroid mediated inflammation reduction, convalescent plasma therapy, antibiotics for treatment of secondary bacterial sepsis and non-specific antivirals, etc., do not show much effectivity in severe cases of COVID-19. The main reason behind the failure of these therapies is the cytokine storm in the lungs generated by the virus. In the computed tomography scans, these cytokine storms (an augmented immune response in the body towards any external stimulus) appear as inflammatory lesions with ground-glass opacity [3, 4] . The commonly reported symptoms are cough, throat pain, mild/high fever, muscle soreness, or body ache. A sudden deterioration in the health condition of the patients are seen in the later stages of diseases progression. Rapid failure of multiple organs and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) results in death within a very short period of time.

It can be hypothesized that the MSC therapy might prevent the triggering of cytokine storm by the activated immune system, and the reparative properties of the stem cells might promote endogenous repair [18] . Mesenchymal stem cells when intravenously injected will lead to some part of the population getting entrapped in the lungs. While trapped within the lungs, a wide variety of soluble mediators, including antimicrobial peptides, antiinflammatory cytokines, extracellular vesicles, and angiogenic growth factors are released by the MSCs [19] [20] [21] . The pattern of anti-inflammatory mediators released is specific for the inflammatory lung environment encountered. The pattern of these released mediators are regulated through differential activation of the damage and pathogen-associated molecular pathogen receptors expressed on the cell surfaces of MSCs, [22] including TLRs (toll-like J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f receptors) that, in case of COVID-19, are activated by viral unmethylated CpF-DNA (TLR9) and viral RNA (TLR3), leading to sub sequential cellular signalling pathways and thereafter activation of MSCs [23] . Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) secreted by MSCs promote the restoration of disrupted alveolar-capillary barriers due to the pathogenesis of ARDS [24] . Extracellular vesicles containing specific miRNA ans inhibitory mRNAs are also known to regulate the protective effects of MSCs in pre-clinical models of non-infectious acute lung inhuries or bacterial sepsis in lungs [25] . The pulmonary microenvironment could be recovered with the help of these MSCs, thus protecting the alveolar epithelial cells. Hence, pulmonary fibrosis of the lungs could be prevented, which may lead to curing COVID-19 caused pneumonia. In the multiple disease condition, the immunomodulatory effects will be responsible for improved function after MSC infusion. A variety of paracrine factors are secreted by these cells. These paracrine factors interact with the immune cells, eventually leading to immunomodulation. The vigorous anti-inflammatory activities of MSCs will actually be responsible for improvements after their infusion in COVID-19 patients.",

A major pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1 (Tumour Necrosis Factor), exhibited a decline in its levels in the MSC treated COVID-19 patients, with an elevation in the concentration of IL-10 (Interleukin-10) compared to the patients treated with conventional therapy [9] .

In case of the two patients having common symptoms, no significant increase in dendritic cells (DC,CXCR3 -) or CXCR3 -(regulatory T cells) were reported. Whereas in the case of the patients with severe symptoms, both dendritic cells as well as regulatory T cells were found to have increased following the treatment. Also, in the 3 severe control patients enrolled for placebo treatment, no significant increase in CXCR3dendritic cell were observed. The percentages of CXCR3 + CD + T cells, CXCR3 + CD4 + T cells and CXCR3 + natural killer cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were remarkably high compared to the healthy control, before the MSC infusion. This triggered the cytokine storm as a result of inflammation. But within 6 days, it was found that the overactivation of natural killer cells, as well as T cells, nearly subsided, and the subpopulation of the cells reverted to the normal levels. The MSC infusion didn't show any side effects. CT scans of chest revealed that pneumonia infiltration was remarkably reduced. Most of the patients were reported negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test within 7-14 days after the infusion. The most exciting and extraordinary finding of the study was the overall improvement of an elderly patient who was critically ill previously.",

Two successfully completed studies out of the 17 studies registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov reported positive results in treating respiratory disorders using MSCs. The study entitled \"A study to evaluate the potential role of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\" (clinical trial number: NCT01385644) was mainly aimed to provide evidence of safe infusion of placental MSCs from unrelated or related Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched or HLA identical donors in the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) treatment. Results of the study provided evidence of stabilized and improved lung function. The other study entitled human J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mesenchymal stem cells for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was aimed to infuse allogenic bone marrow derived human MSCs intravenously in patients having ARDS and assess the safety of the intravenous infusion (clinical trial number: NCT01775774). The study was conducted in two phases, with the first phase involving the intravenous infusion of stromal MSCs in 9 patients with ARDS. It was revealed that the infusion of the MSCs was safe and no treatment-related adverse events or infusion-linked events were reported [16]. The second phase of the study suggested that the severity of acute lung injury was reduced in a sheep model having bacterial pneumonia on treatment with hMSCs [17]. Out of the 70 registered trials, one registered trial (clinical trial number: NCT04313322) at https://clinicaltrials.gov involved the intravenous administration of Wharton's Jelly MSCs (3 doses consisting of 1 \u00d7 10 6 /kg, 3 days apart) for treatment of COVID-19 diagnosed patients. Another registered trial (clinical trial number: NCT04315987) suggested the use of NestCell\u00ae, which is an MSC therapy produced by Cellavita (Germany based company) and has proved safe in various clinical trials. One registered trial was estimated to enroll 24 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (between 18 to 75 years of age) for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia using MSCs obtained from dental pulp (clinical trial number: NCT04302519). Several other trials included the use of umbilical cord MSCs for treating COVID-19 triggered pneumonia. Also, Chinese clinical trial registry site, http://www.chictr.org.cn, has reported registration of 20 clinical trials in this regard.",

The fact that MSCs are resistant to viral infections compared to their differentiated progenies, reflects the significant role played by the intrinsic ISGs (interferon-stimulated genes) in these cells. The expression of ISGs forestalls viral infection[26]. MSCs express several ISGs including Interferon Induced TransmembraneFamily (IFITM), SAT1, IFI6, PMAIP1, ISG15, CCL2, p21/CDKN1a etc., many of which are known to show typical anti-viral responses. The member proteins of the Interferon J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Induced Transmembrane Family are peculiar as they pre-empt infection before the virus can cross the lipid bilayer of cell. This activity attributed to the IFITM proteins prevented infection of cultured cells by several viruses like Ebola virus, influenza A virus, dengue virus and SARS coronavirus [27]. Thus the two unique antiviral mechanisms provided by MSCs, in the context of respiratory viral infection like COVID-19, are constitutive elevation of levels of MSC-specific ISGs to act as regulators of antiviral protection and secondary response to IFN, which induces ISG and hence offers broad viral resistance.",

Thus all the tissues and organs expressing the ACE2 receptor are susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the alveolar epithelial cells have a high propensity of ACE2 receptors, they are the most adversely affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The devastating cytokine explosion attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to severe shock, oedema and multiple organ failure. Administering the COVID-19 patients with an infusion of multipotent MSCs can help to combat the COVID-19 as these cells will inhibit the exaggerated immune response and encourage endogenous repair of the lung epithelial cells by improving the microenvironment. The mesenchymal stem cell therapy has not tey shown any adverse side effects on the patient. In this review we have highlighted all the implications associated with MSC therapy application in case of COVID-19 and strongly place our argument in support of this.",
