In all cases, limitation stimulated leftward frameshifting. In all cases, the stimulation was greater in relA mutant cells than in their wild-type relA + counterparts. In the latter genotype, the increased frameshifting was constant from the start of the limitation regime. This was also true of the relA mutant strain during limitation for lysine-tRNA or for leucine; however, during limitation for isoleucine-tRNA (or for isoleucine) the mutant showed a gradual, progressive increase in frameshifting, suggesting an indirect effect. We suggest that gradual accumulation of undermodified tRNAs, which is characteristic of the relA response, is involved. However, the specific modification involved is unknown.

These two tRNAs are among the four species which contain queosine at the wobble position, nucleotide 34 (Sprinzl et al. 1996) . One possible explanation of the results might be that starved relA cells gradually accumulate undermodified, queosine-deficient tRNAs which may be prone to frameshifted reading. As a general test of this hypothesis, we examined the effect on frameshifting of a mutant allele of the tgt gene, which results in a queosine deficiency in all four tRNAs (Frey et al. 1989; Reuter et al. 1994) . Figure 3 rules out the hypothesis, showing that frameshifting efficiency on our reporter is identical in tgt + and tgt mutant cells. It follows that frameshifting at our site is not sensitive to the queosine modification of histidine or tyrosine tRNA.

Certain tRNA modifications, particularly those at positions 34, 37, and 38-40, have been shown to affect the efficiency of translation (reviewed in Bjo\u00a8rk 1992; Curran 1998; Urbonavicius et al. 2001) . Suppose that certain undermodified tRNAs (such as tRNA-isoleucine-2, which reads AUA) show reduced translational efficiency. Then, as relA cells grow under limitation for any amino acid or aminoacyl-tRNA, undermodified forms will come to make up a larger and larger fraction of the tRNA population in question, and ribosomes will stall for longer and longer periods at codons calling for the tRNA, thus progressively increasing the probability of frameshifting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 324, "end": 336, "text": "Bjo\u00a8rk 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 337, "end": 349, "text": "Curran 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 350, "end": 375, "text": "Urbonavicius et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Further experiments will be needed to distinguish this kind of model from one involving tRNAs that participate directly in the frameshift event. Since tRNAs carry modifications at between 6 and 10 different positions, it would be pointless at this stage to speculate on which modifications might be involved. In any event, it appears that some aspect of the starved relA syndrome contributes gradually and indirectly to the probability of leftward frameshifting, perhaps by affecting the modification status of tRNAs. The molecular basis of this indirect effect remains to be elucidated, but it need not reflect noncognate tRNA recognition, as we once postulated (Kurland and Gallant 1986) .", "cite_spans": [{"start":
