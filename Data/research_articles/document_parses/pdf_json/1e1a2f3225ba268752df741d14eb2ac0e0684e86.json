He also has underlying of hypertension, dys- On March 13, 2020, he developed his first clinical presentation that was episodic watery diarrhea for 12 days and then followed by fever, myalgia, and dry cough. On day 6 of fever, he had shortness of breath which leads him to primary hospital the next day. Physical examination revealed body temperature of 39.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure 118/65 mm Hg, pulse rate 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 times per minutes, and oxygen saturation at room air of 94%. Respiratory examination revealed fine crepitation in both lung fields. Since taxi driver has been considered as high-risk occupation, he underwent nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse real-time PCR which revealed positive for COVID-19. Stool testing for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse real-time PCR also revealed positive. Chest radiography was reported bilateral multifocal patchy infiltration ( Figure 1 ). He has been diagnosed as having COVID-19 pneumonia. Azithromycin together with hydroxychloroquine, darunavir, ritonavir, and favipiravir has been initiated ( Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "However, kidney transplant recipients who require maintenance immunosuppressive drugs to prevent allograft rejection may have atypical presentation of COVID-19 such as gastrointestinal disturbance (diarrhea, nausea) before the onset of fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. A study from Guillen et al was also reported COVID-19 in kidney transplantation patient presented with first symptom of gastrointestinal viral disease 2 days before onset of fever.7 There is evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in feces which indicated small bowel infection resulting in acute diarrhea and can be transmitted by fecal-oral root.9 However, many case reports have found that the presentation of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients was similar to general population, and further exploration of characteristics of gastrointestinal disease might be required.Diabetes type 2 and hypertension of COVID-19 patient were the risk factors of severe disease according to current meta-analysis in general population.3 This case also had such risk factors. In addition, laboratory investigations showed lymphocytopenia and hyponatremia with improvement after treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia which has been revealed in case reports.7 Significant drug interaction between protease inhibitors (PIs) such as darunavir/ritonavir and tacrolimus must be concerned.Extremely prolonged elimination half-life of tacrolimus with PIs in the present study was 10 days as reported in previous study of HIV-infected kidney transplantation patient.10 Acute kidney injury of this patient can be explained by significantly high level of tacrolimus. However, acute tubular necrosis from SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Dosage reduction or withdrawal of tacrolimus in the setting of COVID-19 infection must be promptly initiated. Favipiravir, an antiviral drug approved in Japan which inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase of viruses, has been chosen as the main antiviral agent in this patient. 11 Effective activity of favipiravir to COVID-19 is limited in current reports including kidney transplant recipients. The recent open-label control study from China reported favipiravir had shorter viral clearance time more than lopinavir/ritonavir with fewer side effects such as diarrhea and transaminitis in non-transplant COVID-19. 12 A randomized-controlled study of favipiravir vs. arbidol revealed shorter latencies to relief fever and cough in favipiravir group. 13 However, the rate of oxygen therapy and non-invasive mechanical ventilation was not different. Since favipiravir is mainly metabolized in liver by aldehyde oxidase, drug-drug interaction with tacrolimus is less than protease inhibitors. The Ministry of Public Health of Thailand recommends favipiravir in patient with COVID-19 in the following conditions: (a) F I G U R E 2 Clinical course, conditions, and treatment of the antiviral treatment according to severe drug-drug interaction from PIs and tacrolimus. Adjunction with the other managements, the patient's clinical courses were improved without any side effect of favipiravir. There is no specific treatment strategy for kidney transplant patients infected with COVID-19. Treatment is similar to those patients without kidney transplants. However, lowering net state of immunosuppression should be introduced, particularly in early phase of infection in which virus is detectable. Anti-proliferative medications, such as MMF, should be withdrawn, and calcineurin inhibitor, such as tacrolimus, should be decreased by 50%.Complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive drug has been reported, especially in severe disease.6 Despite of mild disease, reduced dose of immunosuppressive strategies was appropriate.4 Decision of antiviral therapy depends on the severity of COVID-19. However, cytokine storm phase, represented by marked elevation of inflammatory marker such as hsCRP, ferritin, and especially elevation of IL-6, was associated with severe disease of COVID-19.14 Anti-IL6 receptor antibody should be introduced in patient with early symptom of pneumonia together with high level of IL-6.15 In this case, the improvement of symptoms and chest radiography has been found after the initiation of tocilizumab (Figure 2).Severe COVID pneumonia reported by Zhou et al found thatsepsis is one of the common complications and 50% of patients had gram-negative septicemia with high mortality rate of 28%.16 Our patient underwent polymyxin B hemoperfusion which indicated by increased level of endotoxin. And ceftriaxone also administered to prevent bacterial infection. From our experience, management of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant patients should be consisted of early detection, early effective antiviral treatment, decreased immunosuppressant including avoiding drug interaction, and anti-IL-6 receptor antibody when symptoms of pneumonia progress and increase level of IL-6.",
