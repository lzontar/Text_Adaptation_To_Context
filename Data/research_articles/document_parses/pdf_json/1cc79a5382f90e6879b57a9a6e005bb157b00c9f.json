This is 291 further buttressed by the fact that only 39% of the respondents were convinced that their 292 governments have done enough to curb the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. This distrust in the 293 management of the pandemic might also be due to the low testing capability, and lack of 294 strict enforcement of the compulsory lockdown. More so, in many African countries, reports 295 of porous borders, congested cities, increased hunger and poverty, poor health literacy, and 296 expensive face masks and hand sanitizers have all been obstacles against control measures 297 (Lucero -Prisno DE, et al., 2020).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF20": {"text": "All of the respondents agreed on the importance of handwashing and other preventive 299 measures in reducing the chances of being infected.

Others felt optimistic (18%) and happy (1.4%). Sixty -six (66%) of 313 Nigerians and Egyptians were highly optimistic that collectively, the world can reduce the 314 impact or prevent the occurrence of a similar future pandemic. This attitude is encouraging 315 as it would facilitate eventual control of the pandemic. 316 Only 25.4% of the respondents were not satisfied with the WHO's handling of the global 317 pandemic. This high rating of the WHO's efforts at coordinating global health might be 318 attributed to the daily disease burden updates, press conferences, provision of authentic 319 information, travel advise, and support for the health authorities of both countries. 320 It was remarkable that most of the participants acknowledged the importance of in-depth 321 scientific research in areas of vaccines and diagnostics; and the need for increased multi -322 sectoral collaborations (on human, animal and environmental health) using the one health 323 approach as measures that can help prevent the occurrence of a future pandemic.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF23": {"text": "326to this online survey. This, coupled with the lockdown limited the sample size of this 327 preliminary study to 1437 (Nigeria -1132 and Egypt -305). A more encompassing global 328 survey is currently being undertaken. Also, the data was skewed in favor of young329 respondents (18 -39 years) due to their profound interest in social media. Our results cannot 330 be generalized for Africa as a whole as each country had specific measures and peculiarities 331 with regards to controlling the pandemic. For example, in Nigeria and Egypt, not all states 332 have closed their borders, permitting the free movement of people across states. 333 Conclusion 334 The COVID-19 pandemic has profound medical, economic, and psycho-social effects, with 335 over 300,000 lives lost globally. Assessing the KAP of respondents and further education 336 of the general public has proved effective in changing risk perception of the populace and 337 resulted in attitudinal changes that were necessary to reduce the epidemic disease burden 338 (23). Adequate monitoring of social media platforms to confirm and improve the quality of 339 information delivered to the people is of prime importance (24). 340 Both Nigerians and Egyptians have a good knowledge of the pandemic and have a satisfactory 341 attitude and perceptions towards the global response. However, we recommend increased 342 adherence to the health regulations of both countries. Similarly, mental health support should be 343 made more readily available to the populace. Both governments need to strengthen their health 344 systems, and improve their surveillance activities, to be able to estimate and detect cases, trace 345 contacts, properly isolate infected patients, and effectively apply standard infection prevention 346 and control measures.
