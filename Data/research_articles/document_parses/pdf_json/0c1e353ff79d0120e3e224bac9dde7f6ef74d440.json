Basically, there are mainly two types of active contour models: edge-based active contours (e.g., [8] , [9] , [10] ) and region-based active contours (e.g., [11] , [12] , [13] , [14] ). Edge-based active contours are driven by edge indicator functions that are commonly defined by image gradients. The contour evolution is expected to stop on boundaries with high gradient magnitude. Region-based active contours are driven by regional information that can be defined by intensity statistical information inside and outside of the contour. The contour is expected to evolve to a position where the regional information inside and outside of the contour reaches a balance.",

The contour (explicitly represented by a parametric curve) evolves by the image gradient to the boundary of the desired object. Because one only tracks the explicit curve, the snake model is very efficient and requires low memory, allowing a fast evolution of an accurate boundary. However, the snake model suffers from numerical instabilities, and is difficult to automatically handle topological changes of the curve during the evolution (typically, it works only for a single closed curve) ( [16] , [9] ).",

The contour is implicitly represented by a level set function that automatically allows topological changes including splitting and merging and simultaneous segmentation of single or multiple objects. The key idea of the level set method (LSM), introduced by Osher and Sethian [17] , is to represent a curve as the zero level set of a graph function defined in a higher dimensional space. Nowadays, the LSM has been widely used in many applications including computer vision, computational geometry, fluid dynamics, material science, and so on (see [18] and references therein for more details). In particular, using the LSM to implicitly represent the contour and approximately solve the active contour models becomes the most popular choice [19] .",

In fact, even if the analytical model could generate a correct interface for all times, it might happen, for either the analytical or the numerical reason, that the gradient of the level set function would become \"too small\" or \"too large\" on the interface (i.e., on the zero-level set). The gradient of a level set function being too small will result in the location of the zero level set (the interface) being sensitive to perturbation. If the gradient is too large, one loses accuracy in the interface representation. To avoid this problem, the level set function is periodically reinitialized as a distance function from the interface, allowing to keep the norm of the gradient close to the unity and avoiding ill-conditioning. However, the reinitialization procedure usually involves many tricks, for example, it is hard to decide when it should be applied. Li et al. [9] proposed a penalty term to keep the regularity of the level set function during evolution. The core idea is to use the intrinsic property of the signed distance function: the magnitude of the gradient of the signed distance function equals one. A penalty term is then introduced to penalize this constraint. In addition, they proposed to keep the magnitude of the gradient of the level set function to be 1 in a neighborhood of the zero level set and the value of the level set function to arXiv:2007.00525v1 [cs.CV] 1 Jul 2020 be a constant at locations far away from the zero level set.",

We develop an iterative convolution-thresholding method to minimize the energy functional of GAC. Our algorithm is more efficient and stable than the classical gradient descent methods in the level set-based evolution, which is the most popular algorithm in this area. 3. We theoretically prove that our algorithm enjoys the energy-decaying property. 4. Experiments on synthetic, ultrasound, CT and MR images for the tumor and organ segmentation imply that our method is superior than traditional LSM in terms of efficiency (running time), which achieves dozens or hundreds of times acceleration. The paper is organized as follows. In Section III we introduce the characteristic function-based representation of the contours, give an approximation of the energy functional and derive an efficient algorithm for minimizing the energy. In Section IV we show the performance and verify the efficiency of our method by extensive experiments. In Section V we discuss the intuitive understanding on the ICTM and other potential applications. We draw some conclusions in Section VI.",

The snakes model is a pioneer that formulates the image segmentation problem as an energy functional minimization problem. Using a parametrized planar curve to represent an object contour allows a fast evolution with a spline function method [16] . However, it suffers from the fixed topological property. For example, if there are more than one objects in a given image and the initial segmentation contour surrounds the objects, the snake model can not detect all objects.

As for Algorithm 1, we set \u03c4 = 2 and choose the parameter \u03bb as -0.3 and 0.3 for merging and splitting experiments, respectively. Figure 1 displays the segmentation results of the proposed ICTM and the LSM on two synthetic images. The first two rows show the merging process while the last two rows show the splitting process, using selected snapshots during the iteration. The corresponding number of iterations and running time are listed at the top of each image. Based on these segmentation results, we observe that 1. Both the ICTM and the LSM can adaptively handle the topological changes. Specifically, the contours can adaptively merge and split during iterations. 2. Both the ICTM and the LSM can achieve same (or similar) segmentation results on the two synthetic images because they are just different approximations to the same model (i.e., GAC). 3. Compared to the LSM, the ICTM achieves the same segmentation results with many fewer iterations and much less running time.

The same rectangle initialization is generated based on ground truth for images. The width and height of each rectangle is half of the major axis and minor axis of the ground truth's bounding box, respectively. For a fair comparison, we apply grid search to each method to find the best set of hyperparameters that can achieve the best average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on this dataset. The main contribution in this work is a faster algorithm. Thus we try our best to achieve the best performance for both LSM and ICTM, and then compare their running time. Specifically, we search \u03b1, \u03bb and the time step for the LSM in {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 10}, {\u22121, \u22122, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u22125}, and {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 5}, respectively.

The ICTM directly minimizes the geodesic active contour energy functional, while the LSM usually needs to minimize additional energy term to stabilize the iteration. 3. At each iteration, our ICTM can find the optimal minimizer of the linearized functional. This is because the optimal minimizer of a linear functional over a convex set can be reached at the boundary. Moreover, the minimizer can give a smaller value in E \u03c4 because the graph of the functional E \u03c4 (concave) is always below its linear approximation. This accelerates the convergence of the ICTM. In the LSM, one needs to solve the level setbased partial differential equation (PDE) with a relatively small time step. This step more or less restricts the decay of the energy (at least not optimal). What's worse, the reinitialization step after it (or adding penalty terms in the level set equation) usually increases the energy, which decreases the value of the energy minimized at each iteration (increases the value of E \u03c4 ). This makes the LSM converge slower. In the ICTM, thanks to the concavity of E \u03c4 , the minimizer at each iteration automatically gives a new partition (i.e., the minimizer automatically remains at characteristic functions). No reinitialization and related regularization techniques are needed in the ICTM. We plot the energy curves of both methods during iterations for the synthetic image segmentation (see Figure 1 ), and observe that ICTM converges faster than the LSM. In particular, we observe more oscillations in the energy curve for the LSM.",

On one hand, from extensive numerical experiments in this paper, we claim that, our our ICTM is much more efficient than the LSM for various segmentation tasks. On the other hand, the proposed ICTM may not be outside of the application scope of the LSM. This is because both two methods aim to approximately solve the same GAC (6), which mainly determines the accuracy of the segmentation. For better normalization, we apply max-min normalization to the energy values. We zoom in the energy curve of the last 50 iterations to better show the difference between two methods. It can be found that ICTM converges faster than the LSM. In particular, more oscillations occur in the energy curve for the LSM.",
