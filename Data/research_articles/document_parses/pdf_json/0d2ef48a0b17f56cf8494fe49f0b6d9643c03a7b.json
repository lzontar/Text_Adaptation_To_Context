Here we described the case of a 60-year old subject with SARS-CoV-2 infection but only mild respiratory abnormalities who developed an akinetic mutism due to encephalitis. MRI was negative whereas EEG showed generalized theta slowing. CSF analyses during the acute stage were negative for SARS-CoV-2, positive for pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia, and showed increased IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations while other infectious or autoimmune disorders were excluded. A progressive clinical improvement along with a reduction of CSF parameters was observed after high-dose steroid treatment, thus arguing for an inflammatory-mediated brain involvement related to Covid-19.",

At admission, a lumbar puncture was performed, and CSF showed inflammatory findings with mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (18/uL) and moderate increase of CSF protein (69.6 mg/dL). The analysis of neurotropic viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, HSV-6, HSV-8, EBV, VZV, Adenovirus and Enterovirus) was negative. CSF RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was also negative. An electroencephalography (EEG) exhibited generalized slowing with decreased reactivity to acoustic stimuli ( Figure 1 ). The same day an empirical treatment of ampicillin and acyclovir was introduced. The day after, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast did not reveal any significant alterations or contrast-enhanced areas within the brain and/or meninges ( Figure 1 ). Three days after admission, given the persistence of clinical symptoms, high-dose intravenous steroid treatment was started (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for five days). CSF analyses, carried out one day after steroid administration, showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (18/uL), hyperproteinorrachia (127.2 mg/dL) and normal Link index without oligoclonal bands.
