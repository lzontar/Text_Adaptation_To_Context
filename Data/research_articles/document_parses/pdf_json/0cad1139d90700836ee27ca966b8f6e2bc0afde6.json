Although our knowledge regarding the health effects of RF radiation has increased considerably, the scientifi c evidence on biological effects of RF radiation associated with these wireless devices is still tentative. The uncertainties persist, in part, because of the limited number and scope of studies that have been conducted. Aside from the lack of a scientifi c consensus on experimental studies that provide clear evidence either refuting or supporting the cancer induction or promotion potential of RF radiation from cell phones, there is a concern that an established effect from wireless radiation, however small, could have a considerable impact in terms of public health. This chapter provides an updated review on recent research results on cancer induction and promotion in normal and transgenic mice and rats subjected to prolonged or life-long exposure to modulation schemes such as GSM, TDMA, CDMA, UMTS, and others.

Specifi cally, the lymphatic system is the body's bloodfi ltering tissue that helps fi ght infection and disease. As other cancers, lymphomas occur when cells divide too much and too fast. Symptoms of lymphomas include swelling in one or more groups of lymph nodes, fever, weakness, weight loss, and an enlarged liver and spleen (Cotran et al., 1994) . There are two major types of lymphomas: Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Moreover, a lymphoblastic lymphoma -medium-sized lymphoid cells with a high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio -is the most common type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, especially in children. Lymphoblastic lymphomas are the less predictable type, and they are more likely to spread to areas beyond the lymph nodes. Because lymphomas impair the immune system, there is the risk of death from infection. An estimated 60,000 people a year in the United States are diagnosed with lymphomas: 53,000 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 7,000 with Hodgkin's disease, according to the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America. In most cases, the cause is not known. The clinical course for non-lymphoblastic lymphomas is less rapid than for lymphoblastic lymphomas. In mice, lymphoblastic lymphomas are usually seen in animals less than 10 months of age as a mediastinal mass with attendant respiratory distress and rapid clinical decline when the enlarging mass compresses the thorax. Non-lymphoblastic lymphomas occur predominantly in mice older than 10 months, generally cause progressively increasing abdominal distension, and are readily palpable. A variety of factors has been associated with an increased risk of developing lymphomas; specifi cally: congenital status, infectious agents such as viral and bacterial infections, and chemical and physical agents such as pesticides, solvents, arsenate, paint thinners, lead, hair dyes, and high-dose ionizing radiation exposure. These have all been shown to increase the incidence of lymphomas in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 438, "end": 459, "text": "(Cotran et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lymphomas in Genetically Prone Mice: GSM Exposure"}, {"text": "A study was conducted in Australia in which the incidence of lymphomas in female E m -Pim1 transgenic mice was shown to be signifi cantly higher (OR = 2.4; P = 0.006, 95% CI = 1.3-4.5) in the exposed mice (43%) than in the sham controls (22%), following two 30-min periods per day exposure to 900 MHz plane-wave radiation repeated at 217 Hz (signals that mimic global system for mobile communication (GSM) digital mobile phones) (Repacholi et al., 1997) .

Moreover, this study suffered from two general types of identifi able defi ciencies. One type was dosimetric in nature; specifi cally, the plane-wave-equivalent exposure system used in this study allowed mice to roam and huddle freely during exposure to incident power densities of 2.6-13 W/m 2 . Consequently, there was a wide variation of SARs (0.008-4.2 W/kg, averaging 0.13-1.4 W/kg). Only an average response could be inferred from an average SAR, not an individual SAR. Moreover, it is conceivable that the higher incidence of lymphomas was associated with the higher SAR instead of the reported average SAR. Further, mice selected for necropsy during the experiment were not replaced with either other mice or tissue-equivalent phantoms, thus altering dosimetry in the remaining animals. There are also some critical shortcomings concerning the biological assay, methods, and procedures. The study lacked any standardized assessment criteria for deciding which mice would be selected for necropsy and surviving mice were disposed of without performing necropsy to ascertain whether there was infection and/or other relevant diseases, such as kidney failure, in those animals.

The new exposure system, supplied by Motorola, consisted of 15 lossy, radial, parallel-plate electromagnetic cavities (Ferris Wheel), confi gured for far-fi eld operation. Each cavity had 40 mice restrained individually in clear Perplex tubes, cylindrically arranged around a dipole antenna. The tubes were constructed to prevent each mouse from changing its orientation relative to the fi eld to facilitate SAR determination. The exposed groups were divided into four SAR levels: 0.25, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 W/kg.

Restraining the animal in a tight tube during the exposure session constitutes a continuing stress to the animal, which may lead to signifi cant stress responses that potentially could obscure any effect from the exposure to cell phone radiation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ferris Wheel Exposure of E m -Pim1 Mice"}, {"text": "There are also some rather glaring inconsistencies in the published data (see Lin, 2002) . For example, some or all of the mice were dead after 18 or 20 months, according to one fi gure (Fig. 1 ), but they still had weight gains up to 26 months, according to another fi gure (Fig. 2 ) [Figs. 1 and 2 in Utteridge et al., 2002] . The study design included equal numbers of freely moving mice for negative controls (cage controls). However, data for the cage-control group were not given in the paper and appear to have been excluded from the statistical analyses. By not having the freemoving mice form a part of the statistical analysis group, the report was deprived of the pathophysiology of cage-control mice for comparison. The cage controls can and should serve as valuable background materials, which potentially might be masked by stress response induced by the restraining tube used for sham control. It is noteworthy that the incidence of lymphomas among the sham controls (SAR = 0; mice are restrained but not exposed) was very high in this study. Specifi cally, among the transgenic mice, the incidence of lymphomas was 75% for the sham-control group (89 out of 120 mice developed lymphomas: 15 with lymphoblastic lymphomas, 74 with nonlymphoblastic lymphomas). In contrast, the incidence of lymphomas in the earlier study (Repacholi et al., 1997) was 22% for the sham-control mice (22 out of 100 mice developed the disease: 3 with lymphoblastic lymphomas, 19 with nonlymphoblastic lymphomas). The high degree of incidence in the sham controls (75 vs. 22%) makes the experimental protocol impractical. It could have masked an effect from cell phones, or any other agent for that matter. It is unfeasible to come to any fi rm conclusions about lymphomas in transgenic mice exposed to cell phone radiation.

One major conclusion was that since the average lifetime weight was slightly higher than originally projected (30 g), the lifetime exposure received by the mice was somewhat less than anticipated. In particular, the mean lifetime exposure levels were lower by about 18% than the original targets for the wild-type mice and about 10% for the transgenic mice.

It supports up to 2 Mbit/s data transfer rates, although the performance is around 64 kbit/s in the most heavily loaded system, but it is still higher compared with the typical 14.4 kbit/s of a GSM data channel and offers the prospect of practical, inexpensive access to the Internet on a mobile device.

Thus, strict and fast power control is enforced at a rate of 1,500 Hz with steps as small as 1 dB. This means that the power radiated from a handset (and thus the SAR) will have a 1,500 Hz component. The maximum power radiated from a handset is governed by different classes. The most common is class IV with a maximum radiated mean power of 125 mW.
