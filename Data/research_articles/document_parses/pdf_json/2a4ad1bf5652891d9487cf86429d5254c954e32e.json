Multivariate data analysis was conducted based on projection methods, and univariate data analysis based on the t test with false discovery rate correction and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, described by the area under the curve (AUC). Specifically, an exploratory data analysis was performed using principal component analysis (PCA), and projection to latent structures discriminant analysis based on variable influence on projection selection (VIP-based PLS-DA) was applied to identify differences between the groups under investigation. Stability selection based on Monte-Carlo sampling was used to highlight the subset of relevant variables characterizing the two groups being investigated, and to estimate the predictive power of the models, as explained elsewhere. 17 The relevant variables highlighted by multivariate data analysis were merged with those obtained by univariate data analysis. The possible effect of corticosteroid treatment on the relevant variables was investigated a posteriori, dividing accordingly the children into subgroups, and applying the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni\u02bcs correction.

Using the proposed three-step algorithm, 15 patients were classified as having pCAP of viral etiology (VRL), and 12 as having pCAP of pneumococcal etiology (PNC).

All patients were treated according to local protocols with a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) based on demographic and clinical considerations. Oral or parenteral steroids (betamethasone or methylprednisolone) were also administered to 8 of the 15 patients in the VRL group, and to none of those in the PNC group. This different treatment is due to viral pneumonia being frequently associated with wheezing, especially in younger patients, and therefore treated with steroids.A preliminary exploratory PCA on the data for each group did not reveal any outliers (\u03b1 = 0.05). The differences between the metabolic profiles of the urine collected from the 15 patients in the VRL group and the 12 patients in the PNC group were then investigated using VIP-based PLS-DA with stability selection. Reliable PLS-DA models were obtained and proved capable of distinguishing between the two groups.Specifically, for the negative ionization dataset, the model obtainedshowed: A = 1 component, AUC = 0.96 (P < .01), an AUC during sevenfold full cross-validation of 0.87 (P = .04), and a median AUC pred calculated by stability selection of 0.80 (fifth percentile = 0.56). For the positive ionization dataset, the figures were: A = 1 component, AUC = 0.97 (P < .01), an AUC during sevenfold full cross-validation of 0.87 (P = .02), and a median AUC pred of 0.75 (fifth percentile = 0.50).Figure 1shows the scatter plots of the scores obtained for the two models.

By applying this approach to compare children carrying a lung infection of PNC or VRL etiology, the present study shows that different types of lung infection affect this children\u02bcs metabolome in different ways. The opportunities offered by host-focused as opposed to pathogen-focused diagnostics in the field of infectious diseases have been the object of increasing interest.18 The \"omic sciences\" enable the most thorough assessment of the host\u02bcs response to a given set of environmental and/or clinical conditions, thus providing a unique opportunity to uncover diagnostic biomarkers and biological pathways in infectious diseases that may pave the way to personalized therapies.To date, only a handful of published studies have examined the potential of metabolomic analysis applied to pneumonia, 19-25 but they have all been successful in highlighting the remarkable opportunities afforded by this high-throughput analytical tool. In particular, metabolomic analysis has proved capable of discriminating between different pneumonia etiologies in adults. Slupsky et al 20 found that pneumococcal pneumonia has a metabolite fingerprint clearly distinguishable from that of bacterial pneumonia of other etiologies, or viral pneumonia. Banoei et al 21 replicated these results by showing that H1N1 pneumonia generated a different plasma metabolic profile from that of bacterial culture-positive pneumonia. Although metabolomic analyses focusing on pediatric CAP have so far been limited to small-scale studies, 22-25 Adamko et al 25 demonstrated that NMR-based metabolomics discriminated respiratory tract infections caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus from bacterial infections. Metabolites belonging to the adrenal steroid synthesis and degradation pathway were the most prominent among those discriminating the etiology of CAP in our sample. In particular, urine samples from pneumococcal cases showed a relative increase in the concentrations of both the precursors of adrenal steroids, that is, androstenedione (a testosterone precursor) and pregnanediol (a derivative of progesterone), and their catabolites (ie, 11-b-OHandrosterone, tetrahydrocortisone, and cortolone-3-glucuronide). A relative increase in the concentration of 18-hydroxycortisol was also noted, which is a derivative of cortisol synthesized by zona fasciculata 11-beta hydroxylase in physiological conditions. This pattern of metabolites is consistent with a global increase in the adrenal cortex bio-synthetic activity driven by the stimulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. 26-28 Regulation of the HPA axis during bacterial infection involves a complex interaction between neuroendocrine and immune systems that is still not fully understood. 29,30 Cortisol biosynthesis and degradation are crucial to the host response mechanism in the event of severe infections, and many studies have examined the role of cortisol plasma levels as an indicator of CAP prognosis. 31-33 Our study offers new evidence on the pathophysiology of the HPA axis in the course of pCAP and shows that changes in adrenal steroid metabolism occur even in relatively mild cases of CAP, since none of the patients enrolled in our study were admitted to the intensive care unit or developed sepsis. The second class of compounds relevant to our study are amino acids and their derivatives. Generally speaking, plasma concentrations of amino acids are disrupted in the course of severe bacterial infection and sepsis, with greater changes corresponding to a worse prognosis in terms of survival. 34 In particular, we found a significant difference in the relative concentrations of leucine, urocanic acid (the F I G U R E 1 Scatter plot of the scores obtained for the VIP-based PLS-DA models for the NEG dataset (A), and POS dataset (B); light gray circles represent the urine samples in the VRL group, black circles those in the PNC group.

Pneumococcal CAP prompts a stronger activation of the HPA axis, a marked organelle dysfunction, a relative increase in cGMP, and a significantly deranged amino acid metabolism. viral CAP, on the other hand, reduces prolidase activity and impairs macrophage activation. If confirmed by further, larger studies, these findings may have practice-changing implications, possibly prompting the use of rapid point-of-care, urine-based multi-sticks for the diagnosis and management of pneumococcal CAP.
