Our study objective was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada. Methods: Data sources consisted of two distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and testing across respondent groups. Results: We found that 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canadawide respondents had a symptom in the previous month over March-April 2020. Across the three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic responses. Women, younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous/First nations/Inuit/M\u00e9tis were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath. Interpretation: The low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of current SARS-CoV-2 testing rates. All rights reserved.

[6] [7] [8] [9] Syndromic surveillance is a public health tool that has been used extensively to identify the beginning of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States [10] [11] [12] and Canada, and for other viral and bacterial diseases globally. 13 Where testing is incomplete, selfreported symptoms data is used to supplement confirmed case counts and estimate the true extent of disease. 1 The value of syndromic surveillance is higher when syndromes are illness-specific. However, because of the broad range of symptomatic presentations observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, a highly specific definition is likely to lack sensitivity and miss most people who would be eligible for testing. 7 Whereas grouping symptoms into clinical syndromes is likely to increase specificity, looking at the occurrence of any described symptom is the most sensitive way to measure all those who would be eligible for COVID-19 testing.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 99, "end": 101, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 102, "end": 103, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 209, "end": 211, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 212, "end": 213, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 530, "end": 531, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 712, "end": 715, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 716, "end": 719, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 720, "end": 723, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 724, "end": 727, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 885, "end": 889, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 890, "end": 894, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 895, "end": 899, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 965, "end": 967, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1110, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1419, "end": 1420, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BACKGROUND"}, {"text": "In Canada, phone and internet methods have been used to collect symptomatic and testing information from voluntary public participants.

Our findings highlight the significant room to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. We have also identified groups with higher symptom prevalence (women, younger age groups, Indigenous/First Nations/Inuit/M\u00e9tis)-information which can be used to refine testing strategies and outreach. Syndromic surveillance data such as these can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to gauge the adequacy of current SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We thank Boston Children's Hospital, the Angus Reid Institute, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research for providing the data used in this study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Acknowledgements:"}, {"text": "Research bear no responsibility for the analyses or interpretations of the data presented here.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Boston Children's Hospital, the Angus Reid Institute, Forum Research and Mainstreet"}, {"text": "Funding: this study received no specific funding.
