Covid-19 Spanish confirmed data obtained from Worldometer and Spain Stock Market data (IBEX 35) data obtained from Yahoo Finance. Data starts from 12 IBEX). In this study, the SutteARIMA method will be used. For the evaluation of the forecasting methods we applied forecasting accuracy measures, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Based on the results of ARIMA and SutteARIMA forecasting methods, we conclude that the SutteARIMA method is most suitable than ARIMA to calculate the daily forecasts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 and IBEX in Spain. The MAPE value of 0.1905 (smaller than 0.04 compared to MAPE value of ARIMA) for confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain and 0,0202 for IBEX stock.

This growth was driven by an increase in the projected growth in developing markets and developing economies as well as rapid growth in developed countries. IMF also expected growth for 2018 and 2019 to increase by 0.2 percent annually compared to World Economics Outlook (WEO) in October 2017. In addition, IMF explained that the increase was also driven by the recovery in investment in developed countries, strong economic growth in developing countries in Asia, progress in developing countries of Europe, and signs of recovery in some commodity exporters. Furthermore, this growth was also supported by a strong impetus, the good market sentiment, the accommodative financial conditions, as well as domestic and international impact of the expansionary fiscal policy in the United States.
