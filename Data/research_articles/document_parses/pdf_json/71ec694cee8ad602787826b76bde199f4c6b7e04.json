[3] Notably, about 50% of scientific manuscripts are now published \"Open Access\" and \"are freely available within a year or two of publication. \" [12] Approximately 12% of the papers are freely available immediately on publication and another 32% after a 6-12 months delay. Sixty-one percent of biomedical research papers were freely available in some form.

[3] \ue062e lower authors' fees are used to cover the technical costs of publishing in the internet published journals. Alternatively, in this transitional period, some of the higher fees charged by publishing houses are still returned to support the parent organizations (publishing houses and trade medical/surgical organizations). In the push to make the scientific literature Open Access, small scientific societies feared that they could suffer damage from loss of publishing revenues. Many rely on subscription revenue from their journals to fund other activities. \ue062e big commercial publishers have the larger size and profits to absorb financial losses in some of their journals, while the societies who publish a small number of journals may suffer a significant loss in revenue to Open Access publishing.

To ease the financial burden of the loss of revenue on the publishers, a transitional plan to \"Open Access\" by 2024 was devised. \"Plan S, due to begin in 2021, requires researchers funded by participating agencies to ensure that their papers are free to read on publication. To ease the transition, the plan allows authors to publish in a 'hybrid' journal, with a mix of free and pay-walled content, but only if the publisher commits to shifting the journal to entirely open access by 2024.\" [4] \ue062e demand for free access to scientific papers funded by government sources, thus, threatened to reduce the revenues of publishing houses and their very existence.

Rather, other measures are needed and already exist that also reflect interest in a publication, for example, the number of readers who read or download a paper. \ue062e citation indices were used (a) to assess the number of times a paper was cited, but were also used and (b) in academic credentialing for promotion in academic ranks based in large part by the number and impact of scientific articles published.

Each journal reported the Users/Readers/month metric in their own way as is indicated in their footnotes to Table 1 .
