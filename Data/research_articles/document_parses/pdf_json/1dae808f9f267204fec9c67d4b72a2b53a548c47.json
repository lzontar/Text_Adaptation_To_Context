            "text": "Coronaviruses belong to a group of enveloped, positive-single stranded RNA viruses that are known to cause severe respiratory distress in animals and humans. The current SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic has caused more than 2,000,000 infections globally and nearly 200,000 deaths. Coronaviruses enter susceptible cells via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or via fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus into endosomes. Previous results with SARS and MERS CoV have shown that the Spike (S) glycoprotein is a major determinant of virus infectivity and immunogenicity. Herein, we show that expression of SARS CoV-2 S (S-n) glycoprotein after transient transfection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells caused extensive cell fusion in comparison to limited cell fusion caused by the SARS S (S-o) glycoprotein. S-n expression was detected intracellularly and on transfected Vero cell surfaces and caused the formation of very large multinucleated cells (syncytia) by 48 hours post transfection. These results are in agreement with published pathology observations of extensive syncytial formation in lung tissues of COVID-19 patients. This differential S-n versus S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread from cell-to-cell much more efficiently than SARS effectively avoiding extracellular spaces and neutralizing antibodies. A systematic screening of several drugs for ability to inhibit S-n and S-o cell fusion revealed that the FDA approved HIV-protease inhibitor, nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept) drastically inhibited S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition of cell fusion was observed at a 10 micromolar concentration. Computational modeling and in silico docking experiments suggested the possibility that nelfinavir may bind inside the S trimer structure, proximal to the S2 amino terminus directly inhibiting S-n and S-o-mediated membrane fusion. Also, it is possible that nelfinavir mesylate acts on cellular processes to inhibit S proteolytic processing. These results warrant further investigations of the potential of nelfinavir mesylate as an antiviral drug, especially at early times after SARS-CoV-2 symptoms appear.",

The resultant disease is termed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) and is characterized by acute respiratory disease and pneumonia. COVID-19 has infected nearly 2 million people and caused nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide with a predilection of older people and/or people having other health issues including, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and other comorbidities (1) (2) (3) . SARS CoV-2 is the third human coronaviruses that appeared for the first time in the 21st century. One of the other two coronaviruses are SARS, which appeared in November of 2002 in China and caused 8,098 infections world-wide and 774 deaths. SARS was effectively contained because apparently the virus, although causing high degree of mortality in infected individuals, was not effectively transmitted from one person-to-the other (4, 5) . The second human coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) appeared in 2013 and caused a limited epidemic of few thousand people, but high death rates of approximately 36% predominantly in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia). The primary source of infection was found to be dromedary camels, although the virus was transmitted from person to person in close proximity in hospital settings (6) (7) (8) (9) .",

            "text": "All coronaviruses specify a Spike (S) glycoprotein, which is embedded in viral envelopes in trimeric forms giving them their characteristic corona structures. The S glycoprotein is a major antigen responsible for both receptor binding and membrane fusion properties (9) . ACE-2 has been identified as the cell receptor for SARS (10) , and also SARS CoV-2, while other unknown human receptors may be responsible for its wider infectious spread than SARS. Spike is cleaved into two major components S1 and S2 via cellular proteases. Virus entry into cells is mediated after binding of a receptor-binding domain (RBD) located with the S1 ectodomain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein to produce S1 and S2 proteins is mediated by cellular proteases at the S1/S2 junction as well as at S2' site located near the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage. Fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes is mediated by the S2 protein that contains a putative fusion peptide region. The mechanism of membrane pore formation that leads to membrane fusion involves the formation of a six-helix bundle fusion core by two heptad repeats (HR1) and HR2 domains found in each S monomer forming the initial pore that results in membrane fusion (11) . The cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 has been implicated in priming S2' cleavage, as well as ACE2 cleavage both required for initiation of the membrane fusion event (12) (13) (14) . Also, SARS-S can be cleaved by the cellular protease cathepsin L at the low pH of endosomes, thereby exposing the S2 domain of the spike protein for membrane fusion (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Cell-surface expression of S mediates S-induced cell fusion and the formation of syncytia, which is a phenomenon similar to virus entry requiring the presence of ACE2. Virus-induced cell fusion is a mechanism by which the virus can spread from cell-to-cell by a pH-independent mechanism avoiding the extracellular space and potentially evading neutralizing antibody (21, 22) . It has been demonstrated that the RBD domain of SARS CoV-2 S (S-n) has a higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor than that of SARS S (S-o), while the S2 proteins of these two viruses are nearly 90% identical (3, 22, 23) .",

Importantly, we report that nelfinavir mesylate inhibited S-mediated fusion at micromolar ranges.

S-mediated cell fusion is caused by cell-surface expression of S and it is thought to be a surrogate model of both virus entry and cell fusion. Previously, we reported a detailed analysis of the functional domains of the SARS Spike (S) glycoprotein that are important for S-mediated membrane fusion and the formation of multi-nucleated cells (syncytia) including delineation of domains important for synthesis, cell-surface expression and endocytosis from cell surfaces (14, 15) . To compare the S-o-mediated fusion versus the S-n, both genes were cloned into the transient expression vectors as codon-optimized genes carrying a 3XFLAG or N-myc epitope tags at their amino termini ( Fig. 1: A, B, E, and F) . In addition, S1 and S2 domains of Sn were cloned independently into the transient expression vector pCMV3, encompassing amino acid domains for S1 (aa16-aa700) and S2 (aa701-aa1273). Both S1 and S2 domains were expressed with a myc epitope tag at their amino termini ( Fig. 1, C, D) . Vero cells were transfected with the S-n or the S-o expressing plasmids and were detected at 48 hours post transfection (hpt) using anti-myc and anti-FLAG antibodies in conjunction with secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (see Materials and Methods). Vero cells were also transfected with plasmid vehicle controls or mock-transfected. Expression of both S-n and S-o was readily detected by immunohistochemistry, while there was no signal obtained from the Vero mocktransfected and HRP-stained control cell monolayers. Phase contrast microscopy revealed the presence of extensive syncytial formation in S-n, but not S-o transfected cells, while the remaining monolayer did not appear to exhibit any cellular toxicity (Fig. 2A) . Further examination of transfected Vero cells by immunofluorescence staining for cellular tubulin (anti-alpha tubulin antibody), nuclei (DAPI) and anti N-myc and anti-FLAG antibodies followed by anti-mouse fluorescent antibody provided additional support that untransfected monolayers appeared normal, while S-n expression produced large syncytia in contrast to much smaller syncytia formed after S-o transient expression (Fig. 2B) . Expression of either S1, S2 or S1+S2 domains of S-n was readily detected by immunohistochemistry with the anti-N-myc antibody; however, there was no substantial cell fusion observed at 48 hpt (Fig. 3) , as well as at later times (not shown).",

Cell-to-cell fusion mediated by viral glycoproteins is similar to fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes that typically occur at the plasma membrane at physiological pH or after endocytosis of virion enveloped particles within endosomes followed by fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes to release the nucleocapsid protein in the cytoplasm (38) . Virus-induced cell fusion is an important cytopathic phenomenon because the virus can spread from cell-to-cell avoiding extracellular spaces and exposure to neutralizing antibodies (39) . Virus-induced cell fusion can also cause hyper-inflammatory responses producing adverse effects in the infected host. Herein, we show that the SARS CoV-2 Spike (Sn) glycoprotein causes significantly more cell fusion and syncytia formation in comparison to the SARS Spike (S-o) glycoprotein following transient expression in Vero cells. Importantly, we show that nelfinavir mesylate, a currently prescribed anti-HIV protease inhibitor, drastically inhibited both S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion. These results indicate that it is highly likely that increased SARS CoV-2 virulence over SARS may be attributed to the enhanced fusogenicity exhibited by S-n in comparison to the S-o glycoprotein. Importantly, the fact the nelfinavir significantly inhibited S-n and S-o-mediated cell fusion suggests that it should be tested as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, especially at early times after first symptoms are exhibited in infected individuals.",

Cell-surface expression of S-n and S-o was comparable suggesting that the observed differences in membrane fusion was due to inherent differences in the structure and function of S-n versus S-o glycoproteins. Interestingly, independent expression of S-n S1 and S2 domains did not cause any cell fusion. It is not clear whether these two domains could be processed and expressed on cell-surfaces, although the S2 domain could be detected via immunohistochemistry (not shown). These results suggest that the entire S glycoprotein needs to be expressed in an uncleaved form that may be proteolytically processed either within endosomes or at cell surfaces by proteases such as TMPRSS2, which is known to be required for Spike activation during virus entry (12) .",

            "text": "We utilized the S-n and S-o transient expression system to screen for currently available drugs that may inhibit S-mediated cell fusion and the formation of syncytia. We found that nelfinavir mesylate, a known and currently prescribed anti-HIV drug significantly inhibited S-n and S-omediated cell fusion at micromolar concentrations. These results are significant because nelfinavir did not appear to inhibit overall S-n or S-o synthesis and cell-surface expression. Computational modeling revealed that nelfinavir may directly bind to the trimeric form of S-n and S-o near the putative fusogenic domain, and thus, it may directly inhibit S-mediated cell fusion. However, nelfinavir has pleotropic effects on multiple cellular processes including inducing apoptosis an ER stress under certain conditions and has been investigated for anti-cancer purposes (31, 41, 42) .",

            "text": "Thus, it is possible that cellular signaling processes are affected that alter the post-translational processing of S-n and S-o, without affecting their cell-surface expression. It is also possible that nelfinavir may inhibit cellular proteases including TMPRSS2 that may be required for S-n and So fusion activation. Preliminary experiments indicate that S-n and S-o may be cleaved in Vero cells in the presence of nelfinavir, although it is not currently known whether this cleavage occurs efficiently. In addition, transfected cells expressing S-n or S-o in the presence of nelfinavir did not appear to exhibit morphologies indicating of cellular cytotoxicity, suggesting that nelfinavir is not cytotoxic at the concentrations used in this study. Overall, these experiments suggest that nelfinavir should be used to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections early during the first symptoms exhibited by infected patients to minimize virus spread and provide sufficient time to infected patients to mount a protective immune response. . SARS-CoV-2 spike (aa16-aa1273) was cloned into pCMV3-SP-N-MYC at Kpnl and Xbal restriction sites. The N-terminal 15 amino acids were replaced with signal peptide (SP') and N-myc sequence. C) Structure of pCMV3-S1-N-MYC (S1-n). The S1 domain (aa16 -aa700) was also cloned into pCMV3-SP-N-MYC at Kpnl and Xbal restriction sites.

The S2 domain (aa701-aa1273) was cloned into pCMV3-S2-N-MYC at Kpnl and Xbal restriction sites. The N-terminal contains signal peptide (SP') and N-myc sequence. E) Structure of SARS spike (aa1255) glycoprotein, showing S1 and S2 domains and the cleavage sites S1/S2 and S2'.F) Structure of p3XFLAG-CMV-S (So). SARS spike expression plasmid was constructed as described previously (33, 34) , and was similar except 3X FLAG instead of N-myc was used for detection. HR1= heptad repeat 1, HR2= heptad repeat 2, NTD= non translated domain, RBD= receptor binding domain, FP= fusion peptide, SP= SARS signal peptide, SP'= signal peptide Vero cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either the S1, S2 or S1+S2 domains tagged with the N-myc epitopes at their amino termini. Expression was detected with mAbs against the epitope tags at 48 hours post transfection and compared to vehicle containing equivalent amount of lipofectamine. Methanol fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-myc antibody and stained with HRP staining followed by goat anti-mouse secondary antibody incubation. Images were taken at 10X magnification. Docking near S1/S2 site resulted in docking of nelfinavir binding to fusion peptide (FP) (yellow helical region) and heptad region 1 (HR1) (cyan helix). Nelfinavir is shown in red sticks. Amino acids from the protein that form interaction with nelfinavir are shown as sticks with single letter code for amino acids. B) Docking of nelfinavir on HR1 region. Nelfinavir is shown as blue sticks for the sake of clarity. Amino acids from the protein that form interaction with nelfinavir are shown as blue sticks with single letter code for amino acids.",
