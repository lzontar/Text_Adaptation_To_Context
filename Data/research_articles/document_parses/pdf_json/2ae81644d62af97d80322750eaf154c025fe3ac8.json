The outbreak of SARS-CoV, Deng and Peng [2] , started in China in 2002 and was defeated by disease prevention and control systems. MERS-CoV was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries. Although most of coronavirus infections, Huang et al. [5] , Sohrabi et al. [9] and Zhu et al. [23] , are not severe, more than 10,000 cumulative cases have been associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% and 37% respectively. For governments there are two possible strategies to handle an epidemic: a) mitigation, which focuses on slowing the epidemic without interrupting transmission completely, i.e. reducing the peak healthcare demand while protecting vulnerable groups, and b) suppression which aims to reverse epidemic growth by reducing the number of cases to the minimum level. Mitigation involves isolating suspected cases, quarantining households with suspected cases and socially distancing the most vulnerable for around three months at the peak of the outbreak. Suppression includes the social distancing of the entire population with the added possibility of school and university closures. Mitigation, Ferguson et al. [4] , was the strategy adopted by some US cities during the Spanish flu in 1918 and, in general, by the world in the 1957, 1968 and 2009 influenza pandemics. Suppression, while successful to date in China 1 and South Korea, carries with it enormous social and economic costs which may significantly impact the well-being of society in the short and long run. Hence, 1 Since the inital reporting of the outbreak in Wuhan, Deng and Peng [2] , Yang et al. [21] and Sohrabi et al. [9] , China quickly entered a state of fighting against the new coronavirus based on their experience in the use of suppression policies during the SARS-CoV epidemic. Individual behaviour has been crucial in controlling the spread of COVID-19. As a result of the suppression measures taken by the government, on January 23rd 2020 Wuhan was quarantined and movement was restricted across Hubei province, affecting 50 million people. All public transportation was sealed off within China while outside of China aviation restrictions were applied and several countries initiated temperature and symptom screening protocols towards Chinese citizens.

Specifically for infectious diseases, the World Bank, and other partners, developed the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF), an insurance vehicle designed to provide rapid disbursement of emergency finance. In practice, the World Bank collects the premiums and issues bonds and swaps to private investors, which can be seen as a type of catastrophe bond.

One of the roles of governments is to protect society against internal threats and to defend the country from any external threat that affects people's lives. COVID-19 represents a major threat to people's security.

Although the reinsurance design and pricing challenges are not the core questions of the present paper, we highlight a path that links the already available data to the preparedness for a new pandemic at a national level. Pandemics call for fat-tailed distributions, see Cirillo and Taleb [1] . In Yan et al. [19] , the authors suggest to calculate the expected loss in terms of the expected number of deaths, assigning a \"statistical death\" to each country. Such a method could provide a reinsurer with a sense of the expected losses to occur during a pandemic. However, without adequate measures and regulations in place, the losses might be almost unbounded, and therefore a cap for reinsurance coverage should be introduced. By estimating potential risks and in particular the necessary cap, reinsurance companies \"prepare for the last war,\" using the data available from comparable events in the past. There are several studies that estimate the basic reproductive numbers using epidemiological compartmental models. The reproductive number estimates the speed at which a disease is capable of spreading in a population, i.e. the number of secondary infected cases generated by one primary infected case. 3 In this paper, we aim to provide an insight into an adequate reinsurance design with a coverage cap that provides an upper limit for reinsurance payments. Our analysis takes Hubei province in China as a benchmark due to the stringent measures implemented there since the start of the epidemic. If a particular country suffering the effect of a pandemic does not take sufficient measures to decrease the death rates and control the infection speed, the economic loss would be immense. We adopt a data driven approach to calculate the economic loss caused by COVID-19 by exploring the probability distributions of the infection speed, death and fatality rates using the daily cross-sectional data obtained from 17 cities in Hubei province in China. Furthermore, we consider the parameter uncertainty in the probability distributions by treating the parameters as random variables over the course of the pandemic and investigating their distributions. Those parameters establish the coverage limit of our reinsurance contract and can be compared with the pre-specified \"barriers\" to determine the liability of the reinsurance company based on the relevant contract. By considering the infection speed, death and fatality rates, our approach not only provides a comprehensive perception of the losses caused by COVID-19 but also a measure of the effectiveness of the state's action during the pandemic in order to price an adequate reinsurance contract.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 428, "end": 431, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 448, "end": 452, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1350, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Following this introduction, the paper is structured as follows.

Based on our analysis, we propose two possibilities which can be extended by different options for a reinsurance contract.

However, a government can take measures against the quick spread and high mortality once a potential danger has been detected.

Focusing on the GEV infection speed parameters, one can easily infer that the pandemic in China has been taken under control, with the time series graphs of the location and scale parameters heading to zero by mid February. This shows that measures such as lockdown, isolation, face masks, and so on, taken by the Chinese government decreased the number of newly infected people significantly and thus the infection speed. On the other hand, being distributed normally, the death rates are forced to lower as of early February, exhibiting some volatility during the course of the pandemic. The actions taken by governments do not only determine the associated loss but also the duration of the pandemic and this can be observed in the parameter values recorded over time.

The daily excess kurtosis values,Figure 5d, are more volatile and present higher values before 15 February while displaying relatively small positive and negative values after this date, indicating a tail structure similar to the normal distribution.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "time series graph for fatality ratio skewness (d) Daily time series graph for fatality ratio kurtosis", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "Descriptive statistics for fatality ratio", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF11": {"text": "Daily time series for GEV parameters", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF12": {"text": "Daily time series for Normal parameters", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF14": {"text": "Daily time series for Johnson SB parameters", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Descriptive statistics for GEV parameters", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Mean </td><td>SD </td><td>Median </td><td>Min </td><td>Max </td><td>Skewness </td><td>Kurtosis\n</td></tr><tr><td>k </td><td>0.6170 </td><td>0.2920 </td><td>0.6299 </td><td>0.0008 </td><td>0.9881 </td><td>-0.5015 </td><td>-0.7809\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00b5 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0003 </td><td>0.0000 </td><td>0.0014 </td><td>0.5914 </td><td>-1.1120\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03c3 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0003 </td><td>0.0000 </td><td>0.0015 </td><td>0.4677 </td><td>-1.2250\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Best fitting distributions for parameters of the GEV distribution for daily infection speed data", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter </td><td>Distribution </td><td>Model Parameters\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b3 = \u22120.5248\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b4 = 0.72549\n</td></tr><tr><td>k </td><td>Johnson SB distribution\n</td><td>\u03bb = 1.1917\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03be = \u22120.13403\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b11 = 0.30959\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b12 = 0.59326\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00b5 </td><td>Beta distribution\n</td><td>a = 1.9019e-07\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>b = 0.00144\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b11 = 0.38219\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b12 = 0.67948\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03c3 </td><td>Beta distribution\n</td><td>a = 1.3167e-07\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>b = 0.00147\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": ".", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Mean </td><td>SD </td><td>Median </td><td>Min </td><td>Max </td><td>Skewness </td><td>Kurtosis\n</td></tr><tr><td>k </td><td>0.6170 </td><td>0.2920 </td><td>0.6299 </td><td>0.0008 </td><td>0.9881 </td><td>-0.5015 </td><td>-0.7809\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00b5 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0003 </td><td>0.0000 </td><td>0.0014 </td><td>0.5914 </td><td>-1.1120\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03c3 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0005 </td><td>0.0003 </td><td>0.0000 </td><td>0.0015 </td><td>0.4677 </td><td>-1.2250\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Descriptive statistics for Normal parameters", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Mean </td><td>SD </td><td>Median </td><td>Min </td><td>Max </td><td>Skewness </td><td>Kurtosis\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00b5 </td><td>0.0024 </td><td>0.0018 </td><td>0.0017 </td><td>0.0007 </td><td>0.0095 </td><td>2.2120 </td><td>5.9997\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03c3 </td><td>0.0037 </td><td>0.0037 </td><td>0.0024 </td><td>0.0011 </td><td>0.0194 </td><td>2.8292 </td><td>9.5398\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Best fitting distributions for parameters of the Normal distribution for daily death rate data", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter </td><td>Distribution </td><td>Model Parameters\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>k = 0.35518\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00b5 </td><td>Burr distribution\n</td><td>\u03b1 = 5.1224\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b2 = 0.00125\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03bb = 0.00152\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u03c3 </td><td>Inverse Gaussian distribution\n</td><td>\u00b5 = 0.00284\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u03b3 = 8.6910e-04\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
