In the model, an infectious disease can spread in one network representing the paths of epidemic spreading (contact network), leading to the diffusion of awareness in the other network (information network), and then the diffusion of awareness will cause individuals to take social distances, which in turn affects the epidemic spreading. As for the diffusion of awareness, we assume that, on the one hand, individuals can be informed by other aware neighbors in information network, on the other hand, the susceptible individuals can be self-awareness induced by the infected neighbors in the contact networks (local information) or mass media (global information). Through Markov chain approach and numerical computations, we find that the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold can be affected by the structures of the two networks and the effective transmission rate of the awareness. However, we prove that though the introduction of the self-awareness can lower the density of infection, which cannot increase the epidemic threshold no matter of the local information or global information. Our finding is remarkably different to many previous results-local information based behavioral response can alter the epidemic threshold.",

For example, recent outbreaks of the H1N1 flu, the bird flu, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have brought the reduction of going out and the plenty of people wearing face masks. For this reason, there has been an increasing focus on the development of formal models aimed at investigating the interplay of epidemic spreading and information-based behavioral responses [7, 8, 9, 10] . Such as, based on the assumption that the probability of susceptible individual going to the alter state is proportional to the number of infected neighbors, Sahnehet al. extended the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model to a Susceptible-Alter-Infected-Susceptible (SAIS) model [11, 12] , and they found that the way of behavioral response can enhance the epidemic threshold; Meloni et al. studied a metapopulation model that incorporates several scenarios of self-initiated behavioral changes into the mobility patterns of individuals, and they found that such behavioral changes do not alter the epidemic threshold, but may produce a negative impact on disease, i.e., the density of infection is increased [13] ; In Refs. [14, 15, 16] , authors investigated the effects of the information-based behavioral responses on the epidemic dynamics by designing the transmission rate as a function of the local infected density or the global infected density.",

As we know, with the development of technology, information can fast diffuse through many different channels, such as, the word of mouth, news media, online social networks, and so on. In view of this, recent well-studied multiplex network theory has been used to mimic the interplay of information or related awareness and the epidemic dynamics [17, 18, 19, 20] . For instance, Sahneh et al. have shown that the information dissemination spread in another network can help boost the resilience of the agents' population against the spreading and found optimal information dissemination for different topologies [21] ; Wang et al. investigated the interplay of the epidemic dynamics and the information dynamics in multiplex network based on the SIR (R-recovery) model, and focused on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final epidemic prevalence [22] ; Granell et al. established an SIS-UAU model to investigate the competing effects of the spreading of awareness and the epidemic dynamics in multiplex with the transmission rate of awareness as well as the structure of information network [23] . More recently, they further generalized their model by reducing the probability of infected individuals becoming awareness and including the effect of a mass broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the epidemic dynamics [24] .",

In reality, individuals can obtain the disease information through many ways. Inspired these factors, in the current work, we study the interplay between the diffusion of awareness by incorporating the self-awareness effects and the epidemic dynamics under the framework of multiplex network. In the model, an infectious disease first spreads among population represented by the contact network, and then the outbreak of the disease stimulates some people (infected or susceptible individuals) become aware of the risk of infection, and they take some protections to reduce the probability of infection. Meanwhile, unaware individuals can be informed by other aware individuals through the information network or become self-awareness induced by the infected neighbors in contact network or mass media. The finding indicates that the additional self-initiated awareness mechanism can reduce the density of infection, however, which can not alter the epidemic threshold. The results are verified by the Monte-Carlo simulations and the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA).",

In that model, a multiplex includes two layers, one is physical layer representing the spreading of epidemic (contact network), and the other is information layer on where the diffusion of the awareness evolves (information network). All nodes represent the same individuals in both layers, but the connectivity is different in each of them. In the contact layer, a Susceptible -Infected -Susceptible (SIS) model is used to mimic the epidemic dynamics. That is to say, a susceptible node can be infected by one infected neighbor with certain probability, and the infected node can return to susceptible state with probability \u00b5. On the information layer, the dynamical process of awareness is assumed to be similar to the SIS model, that is, an unaware node (U) can be informed by an aware neighbor (A) with probability \u03bb, and the aware node can loss awareness and back to unaware state with probability \u03b4. The interplay of the two processes is modelled as follows: once an individual is infected, s/he will certainly become aware, that is, the probability is \u03c3 = 100%. In addition, to distinguish the protective behaviors between the aware individuals and unaware individuals, let \u03b2 and \u03b2 A = \u03b3\u03b2 (here 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < 1. If \u03b3 = 0, the aware individuals are completely immune to the infection.) be the probabilities of unaware and aware susceptible nodes to get infected, respectively.",

As we know, in many cases, infected individuals are unwilling to tell others since they can be discriminated or isolated by others once others know they are infected by one certain disease. So we make a progress and assume that infected individuals becoming aware with probability 0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 1. On the other hand, in the model, individuals can only be informed by their neighbors through the information network, that is to say, one individual has no chance to become aware once their neighbors are unaware. However, as proposed in many previous works, individuals can become self-awareness once their friends are infected or they are informed by the mass media. Thus, we further generalize the model as: a susceptible individual can go to aware state by self-initiated response with probability \u03ba when contacting one infected friend. Therefore, the probability of the susceptible individual becoming awareness increases with the number of infected neighbors in the contact network [12] . Note that, for the original model in Ref.

Obviously, once the value of \u03b3 is increased, the epidemic threshold is decreased and the density of infected individuals in enhanced correspondingly. Observing the figure, one can see that though the larger value of \u03ba can cause more individuals become aware and reduce the density of infection. However, one can find that the increasing of \u03bb has no influence on the epidemic threshold. The result is remarkably different from many previous results which claim that the local information-based behavioral response in the single-layer network can alter the epidemic threshold. How to understand this nontrivial result? Since the UAU awareness dynamic is the same to the SIS epidemic process. When the epidemic has not broken out, the density of awareness in information network (i.e., \u03c1 A ) is only determined by the transmission rate of awareness, \u03bb, recovery rate \u03b4 and the structure of information network, but is not related to the value of \u03ba. Namely, near or below the epidemic threshold point, increasing the value of \u03ba only means that the initial number of the aware individuals is increased, which cannot affect the density of aware individuals at stationary state. In this case, the value of p A i is independent of the value of \u03ba or \u03c3, which gives rise to the same value of \u03c1 A [see Fig. 4(b) ]. Thus, according to Eqs. (13) and (15), the epidemic threshold \u03b2 c is invariable owing to the same value of \u03c1 A . One should note that, for the case of single-layer network, the local information-based behavioral response can directly reduce the transmission rate of epidemic, leading to the change of the epidemic threshold. For our model, the self-awareness behavior first diffuses through the information network, and then the epidemic process happens in contact network. Thus, the effect of the awareness behavior on the transmission rate is indirect.",

By introducing the self-awareness mechanism for susceptible individuals, we have investigated interplay between the spreading of epidemic and the diffusion of awareness based on the framework of the multiplex networks. We mainly studied the two parameters \u03ba and \u03c3 characterizing the self-awareness probability of susceptible individuals and infected individuals, respectively. Analysis based on the Markov chain approach as well as the extensive computations reveal that the density of infection can be reduced once the two parameters are increased, however, we found that the impact of self-awareness behavior for susceptible individuals on inhibiting the spreading of epidemic is much better than the self-awareness of the infected individuals, since selfawareness from susceptible individuals can directly reduce their probabilities of being infected. Meanwhile, we found that the self-awareness behavior cannot alter the epidemic threshold no matter of the local or global information, which are in stark contrast with the results obtained from the single-layer networks.",

In the model, each individual becomes aware with probability m by assuming that they are informed by a broadcast or mass media. Thus, it can be regarded as a global informationbased awareness. One questionable point is that the probability of being awareness m is irrelevant to the density of infection. As a result, even the epidemic is almost eliminated, individuals also have the fix probability of being aware. In reality, becoming awareness often means that individuals need to take some protective measures, such as, washing hands, wearing masks or reducing outgoings. These measures indicate certain inconveniences or some cost [27, 28] . Thus, a more realistic situation is that the probability of being awareness should be related to the density of infection. To mimic this case, here we assume the probability of aware from global information is given as: mI(t) with I(t) is the density of infection at time t, which indicates that the probability of being awareness adaptively varies with the density of infection.",
