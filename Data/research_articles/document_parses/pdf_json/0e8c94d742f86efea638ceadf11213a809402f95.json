The hospitalization numbers cannot be considered to be representative of the number of infected people, and, at present, the number of asymptomatic, undiagnosed infections is largely unknown. However, we are aware that even using the number of casualties is uncertain, since there can be an under-ascertainment of deaths, but the figures cannot vary as much as the error related to the infected individuals. Hence, the reported number of deceased people could possibly be underestimated due to undeclared cases. This number depends on the country (quality of the health system) and average age of the population, but it is certain that this novel virus is more deadly and spreads more quickly than seasonal flu. Moreover, authorities make a distinction between a death that occurred \"with the co-action\" of the virus and a death \"caused by\" the virus. Indeed, only a small percentage of the casualties were in a healthy condition prior to the infection, and most of the patients were already affected by other illnesses (e.g., diabetes, dementia, cancer, stroke). Therefore, we also consider cases where 100% more people actually died per day compared to the official figures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Case"}, {"text": "In order to accomplish the fit, we use the simulated annealing algorithm developed by Goffe et al. (21) . The Fortran code can be found at: https://econwpa.ub.uni-muenchen.de/econ-wp/prog/ papers/9406/9406001.txt. The fit is based on the L 2 -norm and yields \u03b1, \u03b2 1 (before t 0 ), \u03b2 2 (after t 0 ), \u03b2 3 (after t 1 ), \u01eb, E(0), and \u03b3 from the beginning of the epidemic (day 1, February 24) to date (day 72, May 5), i.e., seven free parameters. We use the total number of deaths for the calibration. Table 1 shows the constraints, initial values, and results for different cases, where Cases 1 and 2 correspond to approximately nine times fewer exposed individuals at the beginning of the epidemic, and Cases 2 and 3 assume double casualties. Cases 4 and 5 consider a wider range of the lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods (\u01eb \u22121 and \u03b3 \u22121 ). The last column does not correspond to variables but indicates the number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemic, i.e., I \u221e = R \u221e + D \u221e \u2248 R \u221e , the day of the last infected individual (the end of the epidemic in theory), and the death toll D \u221e . The results are very sensitive to variations in parameter \u03b2, and, consequently, those of R 0 , mostly due to the impact of the intervention strategies performed. Figure 10 shows the curves of Case 1 compared to the data (black dots), with IFR = 0.57% and R 0 decreasing from 3 to 0.8 by the end of the epidemic. The final number of infected individuals is 2.69 million (see Figure 11A , Table 1 ). The peak value of the I class is 0.3 M or 300,000 individuals. If 5% of these people require admission to an intensive-care unit (ICU), this amounts to 15,000 individuals and substantially exceeds the capacity of Lombardy, which was approximately 1,000 ICU beds on March 16. Figure 11B compares the infectious and dead individuals (per day) and, as expected, the two curves are synchronous, since a proportion \u03b1 of infectious individuals die. The inflection point at day 22 (Figure 10B) indicates that the isolation measures started to be effective. Strict isolation could not be achieved by day 22 for several reasons, and there is a reasonable delay of a few days before it can be implemented (day 35). The total number of casualties is approximately 15,600, and the effective duration of the epidemic is about 100 days. However, see the last column indicating the day when the last individual is infected, obtained with the condition I < 1. Recent data reveal that the effective duration of the Wuhan epidemic was almost 60 days [(22), Figure 1B] , a shorter period that was favored by the very strict isolation measures applied in that city. Case 2, which considers twice as many casualties and the results for which are shown in Figure 12 , has a high fatality rate, IFR = 2.37%, but 1.33 million infected people. If the number of exposed individuals is much higher (Case 3), we obtain IFR = 0.47% and 6.5 million infected people (see Figures 13, 14, Table 1 ), but in this case, the fit is not optimal at the beginning of the epidemic.

The algorithm achieves a very good fit to the data with IFR = 3.6%, comparable periods to Case 1, and 0.44 M infected individuals.

Fewer initially exposed and infectious individuals requires a higher IFR to fit the curve, but a higher R 0 could also have the same effect if the IFR is kept within a realistic range.
