This is due to stay-at-home measures, less available transportation, business closures, and lost family income. In response, diabetes centres in various countries are addressing these challenges with courage and innovation. Volunteers with T1D along with health professionals and their own families are delivering supplies over long distances on motorbikes and by taxi, after gaining police permits, in Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Uganda and India.",

            "text": "The lockdowns have also increased the price of food and decreased access to it. Such food insecurity is particularly dangerous for people with T1D. Diabetes associations in Rwanda, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Ghana, and Mauritania are providing food parcels and other support to families with a child or youth with T1D. These distribution efforts are being supported by Life for a Child (LFAC), Partners in Health, Marjorie's Fund, Sonia Nabeta Foundation and others. Curtailment of international flights has resulted in difficulties with deliveries of supplies, particularly insulin given its cold-chain requirements. A large shipment of LFAC-donated insulin was stuck in-transit at an airport in Germany for several few weeks until a route to Ethiopia was found, which was at much greater expense than usual costs. For some other LFAC insulin shipments, ocean freight using refrigerated containers is currently being considered as no air-freight options are available. The Insulin for Life network is sending out emergency parcels to various countries. Further compounding delivery difficulties, government shutdowns are delaying customs approvals for shipments of insulin and blood glucose meters and strips. Finally, many centres caring for young people with T1D in LMICs rely on income from private patients or local donors to provide care to lower-income families, and these sources of funds have been sharply reduced. LFAC has provided staff support and funds for personal protective equipment (PPE) for Maldives and Bolivia. Need for accurate information The pandemic has led to much global anxiety, which is heightened in anyone with a pre-existing condition such as T1D. There is also much misinformation. In addition to imposed internal travel restrictions, various countries have reported a reduction in routine clinic visits due to fear from people with T1D. It is essential that accurate information is disseminated that covers general advice (e.g., the importance of social distancing, and hand-washing), sick-day management to prevent DKA, and reassurance about risk. It is also critical that clinics provide 24-hour call services for advice. Diabetes education webinars are being delivered by Fundaci\u00f3n Diabetes Juvenil in Ecuador. In Mali, more than 1,000 people with diabetes are receiving prevention messages from Sant\u00e9 Diab\u00e8te via SMS. In India, Samatvam Endocrinology Diabetes Centre is delivering telemedicine using WhatsApp. Rwanda also has a WhatsApp group run by T1D health professionals.",

Decreased health budgets could threaten country procurement of essential medicines (such as insulin) and other supplies critical for T1D care, which would both imperil care of indigent individuals with T1D and impede country progress towards universal health coverage of diabetes care. [8] In-country diabetes associations and other stakeholders should compile information on annual demand, previous orders, current reserves, and identify supply gaps, possible alternate suppliers, and local challenges such as customs approvals and logistics, and then maintain advocacy at sufficiently high levels until the supplies and other budget lines are secured.
