Because these viruses are not routinely cultivated in clinical laboratories, molecular detection utilizing high throughput multiplex PCR assays has been developed and widely applied in the past decade [Freymuth et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007; Khamis et al., 2012] .

Non-respiratory infection was identified in 4 of 94 cases using antibiotics (one of Salmonella bacteremia and three of urinary tract infection), and the four cases were excluded in the calculation of risk factors of antibiotic usage. Potential risk factors related to a higher rate of antibiotic use including intensive care, clinical diagnoses, laboratory analysis of white cell count and CRP level, and viral co-infection were analyzed by logistic regression. The significant factors were shown as in order: (1) CRP 3 4.0 (P < 0.001; odds ratio \u00bc 3.99; 95%CI \u00bc 1.9-8.4; (2) LRTI group including acute bronchiolitis (P < 0.001; odds ratio \u00bc 3.3; 95%CI \u00bc 1.8-6.5); (3) viral co-infection group (P \u00bc 0.04; odds ratio \u00bc 2.7; 95%CI \u00bc 1.0-7.2), and (4) fever persisting more than 4 days after admission (P \u00bc 0.04; odds ratio \u00bc 2.6; 95%CI \u00bc 1.0-6.8)",

The profile of respiratory viral infection is expanding with advances in molecular diagnosis.

Of the 216 enrolled cases, at least one viral etiology could be identified in more than half (137, 63.4%) of the cases by combining the results of a commercial multiplex NAT assay and conventional cell culture. Our results are in line with previous studies that identified viral etiology in 34.6-83% of cases [Ren et al., 2009; Niang et al., 2010; Shafik et al., 2012; Marcone et al., 2013; Rhedin et al., 2014] .

Viral co-infection was not uncommon (19.2%), with the most common viral pair being ADV and RV/EV (n \u00bc 4). Viral detection rates for upper and lower respiratory infections were comparable in this study, whereas Ambrosioni et al. reported a lower rate for lower respiratory infections in a pediatric population [Ambrosioni et al., 2014] .

The reduction in viral load after 3 days of hospitalization may be due to clinical improvement, and this may contribute to the reduced rate of viral detection by the xTAG RVP fast assay when sampling is delayed [Franz et al., 2010] . For optimal viral detection, it is recommended that samples be collected within 3-5 days of symptom onset.",

Therefore, the real rate of influenza infection would be underestimated. But we still detected 5.4% of flu A and 8.4% of flu B infection in this study, mostly among URI group. (2) The sampling time varied from the 1st to the 7th day following admission. The positive viral detection rate was then influenced by the progressive decline in viral load. This was ameliorated by testing the samples by both cell culture and molecular detection methods; (3) the period of study was not long enough to investigate seasonal variations, and the enrolled sample size was moderate to determine the impact of individual types of respiratory virus on clinical severity; (4) this study was conducted in a rural communitybased hospital, where the viral prevalence pattern has been shown to be different from that in urban pediatric populations [Gern et al., 2012] . Our finding of the viral distribution profile in LRTI group was similar to southern Taiwan, but different from northern Taiwan [Sung et al., 2011; Chou et al., 2014] . With respective of LRTI, RSV and EV/RV have the equal role in this study. In addition, this study population did not enroll critical or immunocompromised patients",

Picornavirses, RSV, and ADV were the most frequently detected viruses. Viral co-infection was frequently observed, but was not associated with clinical disease severity. The introduction of molecular detection methods, if conducted early after admission, is beneficial for the early identification of the causative viral pathogens, even with co-infections. Molecular respiratory viral diagnostic techniques have broadened the understanding of the etiological ARTI profile. Further study is warranted, focusing on the impact of introducing molecular diagnoses in reducing hospital stays and/or unnecessary antimicrobial use.",
