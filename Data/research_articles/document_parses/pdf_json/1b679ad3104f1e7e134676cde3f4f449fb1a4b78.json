This has been a boon of early insights into SARS-CoV-2 for the research community, but there are also concerns that some of these attract more credence than they deserve. For some, pre-print servers represent a windfall in rapid information at a crucial time for society, while for others, they are a murky meandering away from scientific rigour. ",

This cited a National Academies Press report on the science carried out during the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak, which argued that \"despite the sense of urgency, research during an epidemic is still subject to the same core scientific and ethical requirements that govern all research on human subjects\". \"We don't seem to have learnt much from the Ebola outbreak\", Oransky said. He is concerned that peer-reviewed literature might continue to insist that it \"had really good filters and really effective quality control, but started publishing a lot of preliminary research that doesn't hold up\".

There are additional hoops for papers on medRxiv, and suspect manuscripts can be directed to outbreak experts, Sever added. \"We don't want papers that say a vaccine is dangerous and then find out the paper is wrong, but in the meantime has changed public health behaviour\", he explained.

For him, the peer-review process is tried and tested and journals are now expediting important papers. \"Despite this being an emergency, it is important that we maintain scientific rigour\", Curtis stressed. He noted the value of pre-prints getting crucial information out fast but added that that not everyone has the experience and expertise to evaluate early drafts of papers. \"That's why we have peer review\", Curtis explained. \"There's real danger that a lot of people don't realise that just because it is up online doesn't mean that there are not serious mistakes or flaws in it\". As Sever noted, it is therefore incumbent on journalists to check with other experts about pre-print papers. \"Amidst a pandemic, a lot more people are looking at these things than normally\", he said, so there is an onus on journalists to report these things responsibly, by noting for example that the paper is not peer reviewed and preliminary.

O'Neill added that peer-review works partly by guarding against baser human instincts. \"Often people published for the glory, which is part of the human condition sadly. They will rush something out that hasn't been fully verified yet\", he said. \"Then a non-specialist might read the title, scan the abstract and not have the skill or time to dig into the data. That is the danger. Stuff that is untrue is then published\". The publicity surrounding chloroquine as a putative treatment for COVID-19, egged on by hyperbole from US President Donald Trump, seems a classic case study in exaggerated promise on the back of scant evidence. In fact, a key paper on hydroxychloroquine was published within days of a pre-print appearing, only to be criticised by the society that publishes the journal (https://www.isac.world/news-and-publica tions/official-isac-statement). It is not the only one of its kind: Oransky noted that one of the mostly highly cited medical journals just published a paper on 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, no placebo, no randomisation [5] . Whether that would happen under normal circumstances is doubtful. Whether the paper will prove useful is equally doubtful. \"This is unavoidable.

One reason for putting up work-in-progress is primacy, to stake a claim for a discovery by putting it in print, before having to wait for a journal and for referees. \"It encourages people to put up halfway observations that aren't complete and grab credit for concepts that they haven't actually completed\", Baric criticised. He recently loaded up a pre-print paper on bioRxiv while it was in review at Science Translational Medicine. \"Some of the postdocs I work with really want to do this\", he explained. \"What I usually say is let us submit the paper and make sure it goes out for review, so at least some set of editors somewhere said ok this is high enough quality to be reviewed\". Sever believes that some valuable COVID-19 papers may never be peer reviewed. \"Things move on and authors may feel that they don't need to formally publish\", he explained. Ironically, while a pre-print paper on COVID-19 can be widely reported on news, websites and in magazines and journals, some authors must keep their heads down and refuse interviews if they have submitted the paper to scientific journal. \"We do ask that, when we are considering a paper, that researcher don't give interviews to journalists about our research. That is our publication policy\", confirmed Magdalena Skipper, chief editor of Nature. This puts scientists in an unusual situation: they can have their paper splashed across headlines around the world, perhaps with overblown claims, yet cannot themselves talk about or contextualise their own research. \"The top journals want us to deposit in the public domain even before they go to review, but at the same time we are not allowed to have a press release and they say don't talk to journalists\", said Lin-Fa Wang, emerging infectious disease scientist at the Duke Global Health Institute in Singapore, when asked about a pre-print he had released on SARS-CoV-2. Sever at bioRxiv agrees that the situation as untenable and rife with contradictions. He noted the irony in researchers being told by journals not to talk to reporters, but yet the same journals send reporters to meetings where researchers give the community early insights into their findings.",
