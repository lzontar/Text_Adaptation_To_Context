Aspects of the 1918 autumn wave in India matched signature features of influenza pandemics, with high disease burden among young adults, (moderate) spatial heterogeneity in burden, and highly synchronized outbreaks across the country deviating from annual seasonality. Importantly, we found population density and rainfall explained the spatial variation in excess mortality, and long-distance travel via railroad was predictive of the observed spatial diffusion of disease. A spatiotemporal analysis of mortality patterns during the 1918 influenza pandemic in India was integrated in this study with data on underlying factors and processes to reveal transmission mechanisms in a large, intensely connected setting with significant climatic variability.

Significant increases in the number of deaths associated with respiratory conditions and fever were first observed in the United States in March 1918. By autumn 1918, the H1N1 influenza had spread to the rest of the world, facilitated in that newly globalized era by steamship travel and the intense movement of troops during World War I (1, 2) . Although pandemic death estimates remain disputed, the global toll was placed at 50 million deaths in 1 analysis (3) .",

This work of the past 2 decades has established the following signature features of influenza pandemics: a shift in the virus subtype, an age shift in deaths to young adults, successive pandemic waves, high transmissibility, and spatial heterogeneity in burden (12) . However, our understanding of historical pandemics in Asia remains limited and focuses primarily on the estimation of the impact of deaths (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , with few exceptions (20) . Characterizing the environmental, sociodemographic, and evolutionary factors underlying epidemics is crucial to our ability to develop public health countermeasures and implement effective mitigation plans, and requires diverse case studies across climatic and socioeconomic strata. Here, we contribute a case study of the 1918 pandemic in India, a nation that was made up of a largely rural but intensely connected population spread over diverse climatic regions.",

That is, both low humidity/low temperature environments (as found in temperate regions of the world in winter months) and high humidity/high temperature environments (as found in tropical regions of the world) are hypothesized to increase influenza risk. Also, rainfall has been associated with influenza epidemics in the tropics (31) (32) (33) (34) . Some hypotheses supporting this pattern include increased indoor crowding facilitating airborne and droplet transmission, and decreased vitamin D intake depressing innate immune responses (35) .

The movement of human hosts provides the scaffolding over which pathogens traverse great spatial distances and has been implicated from the diffusion of plague in pre-industrial Europe along silk trade routes (36) to the spread of Ebola virus via regional connectivity (37) and Zika virus via air travel (38) . In rare explanatory studies about spatial diffusion during the 1918 pandemic, Palmer et al. (39) examined the impact of boat and rail traffic on the spread of influenza in Newfoundland through qualitative methods, and Eggo et al. (7) tested whether assorted mobility models predict pandemic dynamics in the United Kingdom and United States. Valleron et al. (40) even implicate surface travel in the spread of the 1889 influenza pandemic through Europe, though they are unable to test this hypothesis because data are unavailable. In India, the railway network began carrying unprecedented numbers of people farther, faster, and more frequently, leading up to the twentieth century (with annual passenger numbers growing from 0.5 million in 1854 to 176 million by 1900 (41)). Simultaneously, infectious disease outbreaks of cholera, plague, malaria, and smallpox were ravaging the country, and Indian rail travel entered the global debate linking human travel to public health. During the year 1918, more than 459 million passengers traveled the Indian railway, and the Sanitary Commissioner of India believed that this played an important role in pandemic influenza spread (20, 42) .",

We also compiled fever-associated, respiratory-associated, and (age-specific and total) all-cause mortality data at the province level for 1916-1920 (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) . The primary source indicated that pandemic deaths were preferentially coded as resulting from fever rather than respiratory causes. (In the Appendix, we compare these cause-specific and all-cause mortality data, Web Figure 1 , available at https://academic.oup. com/aje.) Consequently, we estimated monthly excess feverrelated mortality (above a seasonal baseline) to identify the number of deaths attributed to influenza, using a seasonal regression model in which differences in regional seasonality were controlled for. To provide a finer temporal resolution, we also resampled and interpolated the monthly excess fever-related mortality to produce weekly excess fever-related mortality time series. We used district-specific, weekly excess fever-related mortality for most of our analysis, with 2 exceptions: For our analysis on age-specific death patterns, we used total all-cause mortality because data on age-specific fever-related deaths were not available; for our analysis on environmental drivers of disease burden, we used district-level, monthly excess fever-related mortality because environmental variables were only available at the monthly level. More details on our data and these procedures can be found in Web Appendix 1.",

Although this wave was concentrated, there was significant heterogeneity among our data on the temporal dynamics of the disease ( Figure 1A ). All districts had pandemic onset by November 1918, and cases lasted in each district from 2 to 13 weeks. The northern and central parts of the country (particularly parts of the Central Province and Berar, and the Northwest Frontier) experienced the highest death burden, whereas the southern and eastern districts had less pronounced death waves ( Figure 1B) .

The seasonality of malaria has been identified as May-September during that era, so this would be a confounding factor for those provinces in our study that have monsoon influenza seasonality. Of these, a few are known to be hyperendemic areas (e.g., parts of Central Province and Berar, Bihar and Orissa, Assam) (102) . However, given our focus on the autumn wave of the 1918 pandemic and because low malaria burden during 1918 was reported in historical records, we expect this to have limited impact on our findings (21) . Influenza seasonality remains poorly characterized, particularly in low-income countries and in the tropics (29, (103) (104) (105) . The distinct seasonality we observed in India during nonpandemic excess mortality activity in 1916-1920 coincides with the climate zones of India, based on the K\u00f6ppen classification (106) , with the northeastern region classified as \"humid semitropical\" and distinct from surrounding regions. Our seasonality findings are also largely consistent with those of studies of contemporary influenza seasonality in India (107) (108) (109) and in other countries with mixed climates (104) . However, we note that our methods are unable to disentangle excess mortality caused by influenza from deaths due to other pathogens with similar symptoms (e.g., malaria), and this inability may affect our understanding of nonpandemic seasonality.",

(Comparison of age-specific death data from other countries is available in Web Figure 2 .) High-income countries have reported relatively low death rates among the elderly, but this was not observed in Indian populations, which suggests the elderly in the Indian population may not have been exposed to the 1830s global pandemic virus or its descendants (4, 26) .

            "text": "Although we could not examine absolute and relative humidity (30), we considered the role of rainfall in predicting death burden during the pandemic compared with nonpandemic years. India experiences complex seasonal influenza dynamics due to its size and climatic diversity. During nonpandemic periods, we found distinct seasonal patterns according to regional climatic profiles, and rainfall was positively associated with the magnitude of excess mortality, thus providing evidence for the increased crowding or decreased micronutrient hypothesis (35) . On the other hand, the 1918 pandemic in India had highly synchronous dynamics that supplanted distinct seasonality in different regions of the country. We thus hypothesize that sociodemographic and immunological factors may have dominated environmental ones to synchronize the timing of the autumn pandemic wave, as has been observed for the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic (111) . The magnitude of the autumn pandemic wave, however, was still modulated by environmental factors, with pandemic disease burden being inversely proportional to rainfall. We speculate that this surprising result can be explained by the link between environment and nutrition. The year 1918 brought one of the most Figure 2 . Spatial age structure, heterogeneity, and synchrony of the 1918 influenza pandemic in British India. A) Age-specific, all-cause mortality during the 1918 pandemic autumn wave, by province. For comparison, we considered the age-specific, all-cause deaths during the 1917 seasonal influenza epidemic for all of India. Age groups are defined as follows: young children, <5 years; school children, 5-20 years; young adults, 20-30 years; adults, 30-50 years; older adults, \u226550 years. B) The Lorenz curve illustrates the distribution of the total number of excess deaths for the 1918-1919 pandemic wave as a function of cumulative (ascending) population size at the district level. The blue circles represent the empirical data that demonstrate moderate heterogeneity (with a Gini coefficient of 0.27); the gray dashed line shows the null, which represents no heterogeneity in death rates. C) A wavelet analysis illustrates the synchrony of peak time of influenza activity during pandemic (1918) (1919) and nonpandemic (1916-1917 and 1917-1918) periods. Each violin plot shows the occurrence of excess mortality peaks across districts within a given province between June of the first year and May of the subsequent year. Central P, Central Province. severe droughts of the twentieth century to India, except in the northeastern region, which received excess rain during the monsoon season (June to August) (112, 113) . These dry conditions, although beneficial for depressing other infectious diseases such as malaria and plague, led to food and milk shortages, thus increasing susceptibility to infection (21, 114, 115) . Our findings support this hypothesis in the models with an asynchronous association between rainfall and influenza burden. Our results also show a synchronous inverse relationship between precipitation and disease (in the lag-0 pandemic models), suggesting a correlation between rainfall and absolute humidity, but such a relationship would require additional data to test. Beyond environmental factors, we also sought to identify demographic and social processes that could explain the observed spatial dynamics. First, by constructing a Lorenz curve, we identified spatial heterogeneity in the burden of the pandemic in British India and found this burden was nonlinearly associated with population size. Our finding of a Gini coefficient of 0.27 is comparable to those reported for rural areas of England and Wales for the 1918 pandemic (5) . Second, we focused on the impact of hostmovement dynamics on the spatial spread of disease. Past studies have identified 2 classes of spatial dynamics for influenza: 1) a local and radially diffusive wave of spread as observed by Gog et al. (111) ; and 2) hierarchical spread starting at populous centers (connected by long-distance travel) with subsequent spread to smaller areas (7, 116, 117) . Disentangling the hypotheses of wave-like versus hierarchical spread is key to our understanding of transmission mechanisms and to targeting control measures. Results of our spatiotemporal descriptive analysis of and past work on the Indian pandemic are suggestive of preliminary support for both hypotheses, thus we used a data-driven statistical approach to test them. Our findings provide significant evidence for long-distance travel (via the rail network) and for short-distance travel (via a local travel network), thus supporting the hierarchical-spread hypothesis. Other modes of transportation (e.g., shipping traffic, troop movements during World War I) may have also contributed to host mobility and infection seeding (particularly in the port cities of Madras and Calcutta). However, our findings provide a parsimonious explanation for the observed spread without these alternative modes.",

Devastating plague outbreaks motivated an extensive and coordinated entry and exit screening medical surveillance system, of which the railways were a part, starting in 1897 (41) . In addition, railway carriages were disinfected intensely. Modern outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the 2009 H1N1 influenza have brought into focus the limited impact of travel restrictions and travel surveillance, given that the reductions necessary to significantly affect spatial spread are not feasible in practice (118, 119) . Our findings about the role of travel in the pandemic spread (particularly the support of the railway network weighted by passengers) either confirm travel surveillance was also not very effective in 1918 or suggest the pandemic burden would have been worse in the absence of these public health efforts.",

Recent work has highlighted the importance of the \"herald waves\" that have been documented in North America and Europe ahead of the autumn wave (120) . Our data show limited evidence of high influenzarelated death rates during April to May 1918, particularly in the districts of the United Provinces of India ( Figure 1 ). Although this epidemic may have been a herald wave, perhaps explaining the United Provinces' relatively mild autumn pandemic wave, the United Provinces' year-round excess mortality activity makes it difficult to distinguish from a seasonal influenza outbreak.",

India of 1918 represents a unique case study with a highly rural population in a climatically diverse setting, intraconnected via railways and interconnected with the rest of the globe through shipping traffic. The lack of elderly sparing and a largely missing herald wave place the 1918 pandemic in India with other rural and isolated populations, although the early, large, and fast autumn wave make it similar to the pandemic dynamics of large, connected locations. Our findings provide a parsimonious explanation of the spatial dynamics of the pandemic in India via environmental and social processes. In particular, our work highlights the role of rainfall in emerging infectious disease dynamics. As our society moves into an increasingly water-stressed future, we advocate that pandemic planning should better integrate an understanding of environmental extremes and how they feed into social, agricultural, and economic processes affecting disease transmission.
