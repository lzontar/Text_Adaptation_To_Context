Infantile hemangiomas (IH) often requires urgent evaluation and risk stratification to determine which infants need treatment and which one could be managed with continued observation (5) . Since most of the IH growth is between 1 and 3 months, prompt initiation of therapy with propranolol is the gold standard for those children requiring treatment. As the need for early treatment could be hindered by parents' fear to access public hospitals during the pandemic period, since the last days of February we encouraged pediatricians and colleagues to send us pictures (via email or WhatsApp) to perform a first screening of patients with higher risk IH needing beta-blocker treatment (5) . From March to May 2020 we identified 7 children with IH at high risk of scarring and/or disfigurement due to the localization (face, eye) or early ulceration and requiring propranolol treatment. We decided to perform at least one direct clinical evaluation since the received pictures were often of low quality, posing a risk of misleading (Figure 1 ). After confirming indication for propranolol therapy, all the patients, in the same day, carried out a cardiologic and a pediatric evaluation. If no This article is protected by copyright.

We decided to scale up the dose of propranolol to the maximum dose suggested, as it has been clearly demonstrated that there are no differences of adverse events incidence between 1, 2 or 3mg/kg (7). Parents were thoroughly counseled about clinical signs of potential adverse events and advised to immediately discontinue the drug and promptly inform us and the community pediatrician in case of sign/symptom such as cough, wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms or lethargy. In all cases no adverse effects were reported and, in line with literature data, a good response has been observed. To date our patients are still followed-up with the aid of telemedicine and a control visit has been planned at the 6th month of therapy. We found this protocol really helpful to manage our patients in this particular period however we believe that further studies are needed to confirm that at home scale-up of This article is protected by copyright.
