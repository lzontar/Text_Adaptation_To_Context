In general, chemical weapons are considered about as lethal per unit mass as conventional explosives and much less lethal than either nuclear or biological weapons (dirty bombs are much less lethal, Chap. 13). Biological weapons can be as lethal as nuclear weapons if dispersed effectively, but that is not easy to do. For BW to be effective, the bio-materials must be chemically robust, remaining stable, not decaying in sunlight, moisture and rain. This can be accomplished with spores and aerosols. BW material must be dispersed widely, not clumping in few locations. BW can be delivered by cluster bomblets from small missiles. BW can be delivered by helicopter or low-flying crop-duster, or BW can be released in many locations in many small spray cans. Bio-disease is much more devastating if it transfers from person to person through air contact, rather than by touch or with liquids. The bio-weapon developers determine the best effective drop size to enhance killing. It is with good reason that the global community strongly supports the Biological Weapons Convention. Comparisons between the relative effectiveness of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are needed to understand this topic. Comparisons are scenario dependent and change with advances in bio-weapons. Future advances will make it easier to start pandemics. Infectious diseases, such as Ebola, smallpox and the plague, are particularly dangerous because of infectious spreading, which is a multiplicative effect.
