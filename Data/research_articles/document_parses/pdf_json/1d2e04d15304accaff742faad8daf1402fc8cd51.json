[2] R 0 measures the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case during its period of infectivity, when the case is introduced into a partially susceptible population. [3] , [4] When R 0 is the critical parameter deducted from a SIR model with homogeneous mixing between susceptible and infectious individuals, R 0 is a ratio between the infection rate of susceptible individuals and the recovered rate of infected individuals and multiplied by the susceptible size of population. [4] Epidemic threshold is established according to R 0 : If R 0 > 1, there will be instability of disease and outbreaks will occur because susceptible individuals accumulate long enough to start the outbreak or the infection rate is higher than the recovered rate. If R 0 <1 , there will be stability of disease, outbreak will be minor or will not occur at all because there are less susceptible individuals or there is a lower infection rate than the recovered rate by increasing of immunization, quarantine or mortality. [1] A disease-free equilibrium is one in which all dependent variables corresponding to the presence of the disease in the population are zero. This equilibrium is asymptotically stable, if after a long period of time a state involving a small number of infected individuals will converge back to this disease-free equilibrium i.e., R 0 <1. It will be unstable, if secondary cases of the disease are generated i.e., R 0 > 1. [1] Brown et al., analyzed the epidemic threshold in the following models in differential equations: the SEIRS model (susceptible, exposed -not yet infected-, infected, recovered -currently immuned-; the SEIT model adding a group T of individuals under treatment for the disease, the MSEIRS model whose newborn children of mothers (M) who are immune to a specific disease are passively protected by maternal antibodies for a certain time and the SIS model (susceptible, infected and vaccinated). [1] These authors discussed the desirability of symbolic computation to analyze the properties of the parameters and influence of these in the epidemic threshold with an algorithmic approach that avoids tedious work by hand. [1] This work continues Brown's algorithm by comparing the epidemic threshold in the SIR model with a single infected state and the SIIR model with two infected states.
