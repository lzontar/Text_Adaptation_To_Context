On POD 8, liver enzymes demonstrated minimal improvement. The infant exhibited transient increased work of breathing and nasal flaring that necessitated respiratory support with CPAP for 3-4 hours which resolved with frequent nasal suctioning. Diarrhea persisted and liver enzymes again increased on POD 9 despite recent steroid administration which lead to the decision to discontinue MMF and to wean the steroids. Liver enzymes began to improve on POD 11. The patient again tested positive via nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR on POD 12.

We are reporting a novel case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in an infant manifested by transient respiratory distress, diarrhea, and significant hepatitis after LT and the details regarding her clinical course. The clinical presentation in this case is quite different from previously reported patients with ARDS and transaminitis, as the post-LT hepatitis attributed to SARS-CoV-2 predominates. The relatively benign pulmonary disease exhibited by this patient aligns with the clinical presentation of other immunosuppressed subjects reported by D'Antiga et al 3 These observations support other anecdotal reports that selective immunosuppressants may mitigate the disease course and severity of patients with pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the mortality rate in adult solid organ transplant re-", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "that in cases of a mixed histological picture with features of viral hepatitis and rejection, prevention of over-immunosuppression and eradication of infection has yielded the best outcomes. It is probable that the etiology of the observed fluctuations in liver enzymes was multifactorial. Though allograft rejection could have played a role in the patient's elevated enzymes, the histological changes of acute hepatitis and her overall improvement after immunosuppression reduction suggests that viral hepatitis played a predominant role early in the clinical course. Since this infant and the donor were in close contact prior to transplantation and the SARS-CoV-2 PCR was not available for asymptomatic patients at the time of surgery, it is impossible to know when the recipient contracted the infection (either pre-LT or through the donated tissue). The possibility of nosocomial infection also exists as SARS-CoV-2 was quickly emerging in New York City during the time of the hospitalization and asymptomatic patients/family/health care workers could also have been disease vectors. There were intermittent common healthcare providers and family caretakers for both donor and recipient. However, post-transplant nosocomial infection seems less likely since donor and recipient were primarily cared for by two independent care teams in two separate hospital wards. SARS-CoV-2 infection was a rare occurrence in the pediatric hospital at the beginning of the hospitalization and both healthcare teams exercised universal health care precautions while providing care to both patients. We should all be aware of the epidemiological implications of conducting organ transplantation during this pandemic. This case underscores the importance of testing all donors (living or deceased) and recipients now that we have the capacity to do so rapidly and effectively before the transplant procedure, since many infected individuals may be asymptomatic, and supports the universal use of personal protective equipment while caring for this fragile population. The increased availability of rapid testing has prompted new institutional guidelines for performing SARS-CoV-2 PCR by NP swab of all patients within 24 hours of undergoing surgical procedures and proceeding only if negative. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with immediate life-threatening conditions will undergo surgery in a negative pressure room and maximum epidemiological control. This case would have been cancelled if either donor or recipient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. One caveat is that the sensitivity and specificity of PCR testing may vary depending on the assay employed. 10 It is also unknown if persistent viral antigen shedding (positive NP PCR) has clinical or epidemiological significance for persistent infectivity/reactivation; this infant has remained SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive while asymptomatic. Antibody testing is a rapidly evolving technology that will potentially aid in the proper selection of donors and recipients. More longitudinal studies are needed to understand the immune relevance of the presence of antibodies.

The first is the likelihood of a graft being infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in severe graft dysfunction manifested by acute viral hepatitis.

Finally, histologic evidence of both rejection and acute hepatitis may be observed, leading to challenges in treatment decision-making. Extrapolation from prior experience with other viral infections, and a favorable result in this case suggest that SARS-CoV-2 hepatitis in an allograft may be best addressed with decreased immunosuppression. Despite previous reports of the usually benign course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, this is certainly not true for all infected patients that merit prudent monitoring especially in the setting of solid organ transplantation. The medical community should remain cognizant of the potential downside of using investigational drugs outside investigational protocols. Limitations could include unknown drug-drug interactions, drug induced liver injury, unnecessary cost burden, and hampering the exploration of more promising alternatives options among others.
