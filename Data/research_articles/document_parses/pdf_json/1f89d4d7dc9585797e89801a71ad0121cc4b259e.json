The few times I had ventured out for groceries, I wore a mask and gloves, showered afterward, and even gone so far as to flush my sinuses and gargle with a disgusting Betadine/saline concoction suggested by my physician parents. I simply could not be sick. Being confined to our home for weeks on end had been bad enough, knowing I was now going to be relegated to my bedroom, bathroom, and study for days on end made my already irritated stomach roll. Questions and thoughts bounced about in my pounding head. Would my children get it? Who do I call to request a test? What medications can I take? Will I be granted extensions on my work? I want my mom and I guess this means I can go back to bed.",

Via telemed, I was told to quarantine and follow the guidelines of those with a positive test result. Quarantine, the word that makes social distancing seem like a walk in the park. However, after a day or two, I somewhat settled into my bizarre reality. Exhausted from the unidentified illness, my days and nights became jumbled. I read, paced, slept, wrote, painted my toenails, surfed the Internet, dreamed, and daydreamed. Initially, my introverted-self was hanging in there. However, around day 5, something snapped. My dreams became bizarrely vivid and my thoughts obtusely philosophical, strange, and different than ever before. I missed my children. I wanted to pet my dogs. I needed to be outside. I ached for human connection. Springsteen's (1992) song, 'Human Touch,' was on repeat inside my head. Desperate, I flung open the door at the top of the  staircase, looked down at my family, and cried. That night, I pulled Christopher Bollas' (2002) Cracking Up: The Work of Unconscious Experience from the shelf and began to read. I recalled from my initial reading an inability to connect with Bollas' writing. 'Who thinks like this?' was scribbled on one of the countless yellow post-it notes scattered throughout the book. That night, on the same note I wrote, 'I do. It just took a pandemic to make me.'",

(\u017di\u017eek 2020: 2) Love without touch. \u017di\u017eek (2020: 2) goes on to suggest that a deep look into the eyes of another can offer more than an intimate touch. I wonder at the idea. Can we truly love one, deeply and intimately, we have never held? Can we look into someone's eyes virtually and share a life-altering moment? \u017di\u017eek (2020: 2) quotes Hegel: 'The beloved is not opposed to us, he is one with our own being; we see us only in him, but then again he is not a we anymore-a riddle, a miracle [ein Wunder], one that we cannot grasp. ' \u017di\u017eek suggests in his introduction that, in our avoidance of others, we are able to truly experience them and grasp their importance in our lives. He believes corporal distancing has the power to strengthen our bond with humanity.",

The first, 'We're All in the Same Boat Now', does not offer the same enticing writing of the introduction but the Martin Luther King, Jr. quote resonates. I woke this morning to learn Magaline Eubanks, a kind and gentle soul who has worked for my parents for years, died unexpectedly during the night from compli- The 'Martian invaders' ruthlessly exploiting and destroying life on earth are we, humanity, ourselves; and after all devices of highly developed primates to defend themselves from us have failed, we are now threatened 'by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, put upon this earth,' Stupid viruses which just blindly reproduce themselves-and mutate. (\u017di\u017eek 2020: 13) My parents' former medical careers could not save Mag. The knowledge of the attending staff coupled with state-of-the-art medical equipment could not save Mag. The virus won and continues to win in the USA. Its victims are often the Black and Brown bodies traditionally sacrificed throughout the nation's history. Are we all truly in the same boat? Yes, in the sense we are all potentially susceptible but no, in light of national statistics and death rates.",

For \u017di\u017eek, the paid workers, those 'whose work has to take place outside, in factories and fields, in stores, hospitals and public transport' are the world's most vulnerable. He challenges readers to remember only work which benefits the community will bring true satisfaction. In the beginning weeks of state-required social distancing, before becoming ill, I volunteered with an inner-city school's cafeteria staff packing meals for children who relied on school provisions to survive. After the first few days of standing in the mealpacking assembly line, I was exhausted. The small group of full-time cafeteria staff was primarily African American women in their sixties. I could not hold a candle to the stamina and strength of those ladies. For \u017di\u017eek, their fatigue, like that of our medical workers, is worthwhile. While I agree, should we not also consider why the 'worthwhile' sacrifice is continually and primarily asked of those marginalized by society?",

It is only through this mortal threat that we can envision a unified humanity.' Currently, the mortal threat of the virus seems lost on the USA. Some Americans are fighting historic and systemic racism through Black Lives Matter protests. Others fearlessly enter indoor arenas in Trumpian exaltation, cheering Make America Great Again (MAGA) at the top of their lungs. Bizarrely, Americans are collectively 'over' the pandemic, periodically pausing from shouting and protesting to jointly storm beaches, restaurants, and shopping malls. The death of Magaline Eubanks and thousands of others were grieved in accordance with the momentary social distancing guidelines. Sadly, they failed to become emblems of societal and governmental negligence and catalysts of radical change. In the USA, \u017di\u017eek's hope for a unified humanity appears to be an unrealized dream. While social distancing may have produced a deeper appreciation of our loved ones, it does not seem to have transformed societal opposites into bosom buddies or, except for the rarest of pandemic love stories, have unveiled a beloved we have never touched and yet is one with our most intimate being.",

Yet, in \u017di\u017eek's appendix, I found a glimmer of hope. My quarantine, psychic intensities, and tears were not for naught. I now understood that in the dead time, the aloneness, I found my inmost being, a being previously silenced by life's cacophony. I discovered unusual but beneficial coping tools: a Mexican blanket, the writing of Albert Camus, and an app that generates the calming sound of ocean waves. Finally, I learned it is the basics, love, and worthwhile tasks we need, and these that satisfy. While we have not unified humanity, maybe the pandemic driven discovery of the necessity of quiet time, personal coping tools, authentic love, and the beauty of basics will move us one step closer towards each other and \u017di\u017eek's vision of global solidarity.",
