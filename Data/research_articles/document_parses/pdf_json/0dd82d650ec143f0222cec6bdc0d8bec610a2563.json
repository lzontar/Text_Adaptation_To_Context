During the world financial crisis 2008-09, product sales in many industries plummeted, or even halted, whereas the service side of businesses was much less disrupted.

How can firms manage a service business model that relies on labor-intensive field service, which implies high levels of customer proximity, when borders are closed and travel bans have been imposed? Hence, executives need to understand how to cope with such calamity and how, once the immediate crisis is over and restrictions are gradually lifted, firms can recover and return to a \"next normal\" and build resilience (i.e., the ability to \"bounce back\") for future disruptive crises. A solution could be digital servitization-that is, a service strategy that exploits extensively digital breakthroughs such as smart connected products, industrial internet platforms, predictive analytics, digital offerings, and advanced services (Ardolino et al., 2018; Paschou, Rapaccini, Adrodegari, & Saccani, 2020) .

Making the case for lease as a marketing tool, McNeill (1944) argued that such servitization models provide benefits to manufacturers, as they can reach customers who cannot commit to large-scale capex investments. In times of uncertainty, such models also provide advantages for the buyer in terms of hedging of business risk.

While many firms hardly sold any new products during the period late 2008-2009, the service businesses often showed remarkable resistance. In addition, in the trucking industry, many haulers went bankrupt or reduced their truck fleet in 2009 due to lower demand. Even so, manufacturer Scania's service net sales declined by only 3% in 2009 and proved a slow but stable growth in the following years, while truck sales plummeted by 41% and did not fully recover until 2011 (Kowalkowski & Ulaga, 2017) . Similar considerations apply to other capital goods industries. For instance, Rolls-Royce in the aerospace industry and John Deere in the agricultural and construction equipment industries captured major revenues and profits from services (e.g., fullservice contracts, financial services) and maintained double-digit return-on-sales during the last decade, irrespective of the crises affecting those industries (Kwak & Kim, 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 613, "end": 640, "text": "(Kowalkowski & Ulaga, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1072, "text": "(Kwak & Kim, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Servitization during disruption"}, {"text": "While the COVID-19 pandemic is not a \"black swan,\" 3 it, nonetheless, has (had) a disruptive impact due to the physical and virtual interdependence in global networks and because many firms (and governments; Norman, Bar-Yam, & Taleb, 2020) were ill-prepared for the dramatic effects on supply and demand. Anecdotal evidence indicates that response to the disruption has been largely reactive and uncoordinated (Choi, Rogers, & Vakil, 2020) and that many firms' crisis communication plans do not specifically cover an infectious disease outbreak (IPR, 2020) . During the pandemic, Scania had to temporarily close its manufacturing facilities for over three weeks, and the company does not expect going back to full production capacity until 2021. Service operations have been less seriously affected, but a 35% decline in utilization rate for connected vehicles in Southern Europe indicates future ramifications for the service business (Kristensson, 2020) . While Scania's competitor Volvo Group did not report any change in service revenue in the first quarter of 2020, the group expects sales to be impacted by lower fleet utilization and vehicles standing still; since the beginning of the year, fleet utilization in Europe has come down by approximately 20% (Volvo Group, 2020).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 207, "text": "(and governments;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 208, "end": 239, "text": "Norman, Bar-Yam, & Taleb, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 410, "end": 439, "text": "(Choi, Rogers, & Vakil, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 545, "end": 556, "text": "(IPR, 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 936, "end": 955, "text": "(Kristensson, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Servitization during disruption"}, {"text": "Crises such as the global recession of 2009 and the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 show that many mature industrial markets characterized by long periods of stability that foster incremental adaptations are also exposed to (short) periods of revolutionary upheaval; change that Tushman and Romanelli (1985) referred to as \"punctuated equilibrium.\" The concept, which comes from evolutionary biology, describes organizations as evolving through relatively long periods of stability (equilibrium periods of incremental change) that are punctuated by relatively short bursts of radical change (revolutionary periods). When facing a crisis with high levels of environmental complexity and turbulence, firms may need organizational structures and strategies that facilitate high levels of both incremental, exploitative changes and radical, exploratory changes (Uotila, 2018) . Exploitation refers to incremental changes to refine firms' current positions (e.g., production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution), whereas exploration refers to radical changes to assume new, potentially superior positions for future exploitation (e.g., risk taking, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, and innovation) (March, 1991) . In the servitization context, exploitation generally refers to a (defensive) stance to protect the existing market position and solidify the ongoing business by improving the efficiency of service operations (e.g., standardization procedures, task automation, the management of service quality, and employee training).

However, in complex or uncertain situations, it is impossible for decision-makers to forecast the breadth of all possible activities and outcomes because bounded rationality filters the available information (March & Simon, 1963) .

Firms need to rapidly respond to not only changing customer needs but also disruptive environmental (exogenous) changes. During such turbulent and volatile circumstances, agility is fundamental to survival (Christopher, 2000) . Agility is the ability of an organization to adapt or respond rapidly to a changing environment both in terms of volume and variety (Christopher, 2000; Swafford, Ghosh, & Murthy, 2006) , which is particularly important when markets are characterized by unpredictable and volatile supply and demand. Hence, we can regard agility as a defining element of resilience.

Building resilience may also require more elasticity, which means increasing the exchangeability and flexibility of relationships among people and things within an organization and a wider ecosystem (Moldovan, Copil, & Dustdar, 2018) .

Each interview lasted between 30 and 60 min and aimed to explore in greater detail the solutions adopted in terms of remote working, logistics, and field-service operations. The managers were also asked to provide their opinions about the most important changes their companies should take in the near future to survive the pandemic and evolve to the next normal. Issues far beyond the restart phase were thus evoked and discussed. It should be noted that the interviews were conducted between March 25th and April 4th-the former being the date the general lockdown was imposed on every industrial activity other than essential businesses, impacting around eight million employees. The managers were fully aware of the potential impacts of the crisis on their business, and by the date of the first interview, most activities had already been stopped or transitioned to remote working to contain the risk of infection. Firms that had not (yet) interrupted their operations, were however impacted by measures such as social distancing or constraints to goods and people movement across regions and countries and reported limited productivity in factories and warehouses or the impossibility of performing long-distance field interventions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Stage 3: In-depth interviews"}, {"text": "The insights gained from the interviews were used to develop a conceptual model (presented in section 5) that shows the different stages companies went across during the crisis.

In particular, the narratives varied in relation to firms' differing resilience capabilities: a) the initial understanding of the phenomenon, b) the reaction to the lockdown, c) the motivations and readiness for the restart, and d) the awareness of what should be done to mitigate impacts and disruptions in the future. Regarding the latter, we gathered replies that had different time perspectives, being oriented to shorter rather than longer-term actions.

In fact, while investments in new equipment and goods will inevitably slow down, the decrease is expected to be much smaller for the service side of business. If the slowdown in the sale of new/produced equipment continues, the service business will even tend to grow in the longer term due to the greater age of the installed base (which will require more maintenance, replacement of parts, upgrades, etc.), as suggested by studies about earlier crises (e.g., Kowalkowski & Ulaga, 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 783, "end": 809, "text": "Kowalkowski & Ulaga, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Impact of COVID-19 on product and service business expectations"}, {"text": "As shown in Table 2 , the respondents reported different expected impacts of the pandemic on service sales, depending on the type of service.

The reasons for this are to be found both in the greater need for these services by customers and in the difficulty of \"changing supplier\" or carrying out services in-house and in the presence of contractual agreements that link the supplier and the customer over many years (e.g., maintenance contracts associated with remote support), which reduce the risk of losing acquired customers (Kowalkowski & Ulaga, 2017) . Similarly, consistent with findings from earlier crises (e.g., McNeill, 1944) , alternative business models to pure sales-that is, leasing or renting or revenue models such as \"payfor-use\" or \"pay-for-performance,\" where the supplier remains the full owner of the goods transferred to the customer-are less impacted.

Similarly, customer training is deemed to have a high or very high reduction for 46% of the respondents. These kinds of services, traditionally delivered physically by the sample companies' field engineers, greatly suffer from travel bans and restrictions and experience a reduction in demand due to the lower utilization of equipment by customers (maintenance) or reduction in new product sales-which, for capital equipment, are often accompanied by commissioning and training activities.

With regard to the \"as-a-product\" sale of spare parts, \"hysterical\" effects were found, which led to a sharp increase in orders (+20%-30%) in the two weeks prior to the lockdown due to decisions by customers to stock up so as not to have to depend on interruptions in production or logistics pipelines (the so-called panic buying).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Impact on different service types"}, {"text": "Interestingly, there is no particular evidence of increases in the sale of remote technical assistance contracts (e.g., digital assistance and customer support).

Firms initially had to become aware that limitations similar to those issued in Wuhan (the city in China where the virus first emerged) to prevent the coronavirus from spreading could have been raised in Italy as well, thus greatly impacting each business. Then they had to rapidly put in place actions to mitigate these impacts on both product and service businesses and operations. As the end of the lockdown was approaching, managers had to set up adjustments to be ready to restart, even in difficult situations, and, in the longer term, adapt to the next normal. In line with the concept of \"punctuated equilibrium\" (Tushman & Romanelli, 1985) , the near future is viewed as characterized by a high degree of instability, by continuous adaptations from one new normal to another (i.e., the next normal).

The escalation has been relatively rapid for all, but some have appeared more prepared for what might happen. For example, those who have businesses (factories and joint ventures) in China or in particularly problematic areas of the world (e.g., Libya or Syria), those who habitually provide services in high bacteriological risk contexts (such as refugee reception facilities or some hospital wards), and those who have already faced critical epidemiological situations (Ebola, SARS, etc.) have appeared more prepared and informed, which is in line with the concept of preparedness (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2019; Ponomarov & Holcomb, 2009) . In fact, these firms seem to have gained more knowledge and mastered practices (e.g., risks and security procedures and personal protection equipment) to mitigate the risks for their business travelers (field technicians, specialists, and salespeople). These firms are also supported by consultancy companies specialized in this field. In this phase, all firms activated task forces and crisis units for the daily management of the emergency at both the local level and the corporate level. Except in rare cases, the central task forces had no operational responsibilities and tasks, being mostly limited to gathering information, coordinating decisions, and transferring knowledge. Each business-and it could not be otherwise, given the specific spatial-temporal nature of the COVID-19 crisis-had always been guaranteed very strong autonomy at the local level. More than central coordination, in this phase, the reaction time and the involvement of key actors (e.g., CEOs, legal departments, health and safety officers, line-of-business directors, etc.) were fundamental. The priority was to understand the phenomenon, collect needs and risks, and elaborate scenarios. The managers claimed that in any situation, the needs of the service business (in-house field service, branches, and service partners) were considered in the same way as those of the product business (factories and commercial and administrative offices). At least, the times when service was considered a \"necessary evil\" (Lele, 1997) seem to be long gone: at this stage, managers showed profound concerns about the devastating impacts on both products and services.

The narrative highlighted solutions with different levels of creativity and collegiality, however, undertaken as an exception to ordinary management to solve contingent problems. For example, \"Can't I perform the repair? Then I suggest product swap.\" \"Can't I find the spare part?

As the service director of the company told us: \"We did not expect that this was granted to us, but they did it\". Other managers have made similar considerations in relation to the collaborative attitude of couriers, dealers and service partners, customers, and suppliers. Following this line of reasoning, we can link the key capabilities of this stage to the concept of agility (Christopher, 2000) . Another consideration concerns the need to act quickly, if not instantaneously, since at this stage, there is no time to develop new solutions from scratch. For this reason, firms tried to make the most, as already mentioned, of the resources and technologies they had already developed or introduced. Examples include the switch to working from home for numerous call center and back-office employees, as well as the attempt to provide remote customer support. These are therefore exploitation strategies that have been implemented to modify, to a limited extent, the ways services have been delivered and, in some cases, conceive alternative services. Again, this is confirmed by survey data (in particular, by the data presented in Fig. 3) , which shows that the digitalization programs that have been subject to the highest acceleration/empowerment are those related to more consolidated technologies (not breakthroughs).

Although they cannot yet estimate the increase of service costs, managers think most prices need to be adjusted, and this will greatly influence the convenience and competitiveness of certain service offerings. This is particularly the case for basic services, such as spare parts supply and reactive maintenance, which already before the crisis faced competition from low-cost manufacturers and pure service players.

The challenges that the crisis has set the world in are certainly primarily related to survival during the crisis and the immediate restart of the economy. However, other challenges that are no less important or perhaps more critical await us and require us to evolve and innovate toward a new future.

It could be obvious-assuming that technological threats such as hacking, power outages, and cyber warfare could impact more on a digitally servitized business than on a traditional one focused on product sales and traditional field-service operations.

All its end-user devices, including 49,000 laptops, and half of all its servers were destroyed, and all its applications were rendered inaccessible (Ritchie, 2019) . Hence, building crisis resilience most likely entails not only ensuring adequate elasticity and redundancy in terms of IT infrastructure but also having sufficient human resources to manage such wide-scale interruptions (e.g., having the ability to travel to customer premises when networks are damaged and communications are down).
