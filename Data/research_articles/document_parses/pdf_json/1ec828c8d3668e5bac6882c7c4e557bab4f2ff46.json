Animal Studied Dogs and cats presenting for investigation of anterior uveitis (April 2008-December 2013. Procedures Aqueous was collected via limbal entry under sedation/general anesthesia, for cytopathology and occasionally bacterial culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Further workup included blood testing (hematology, biochemistry, and serology), diagnostic imaging, nonocular cytopathology, and available histopathology. Results Fifty-six dogs and 39 cats were included in the study. An aqueous cytopathologic diagnosis of lymphoma (or discrete cell neoplasia) was made in six dogs and seven cats, and a diagnosis of large cell carcinoma made in one dog. This diagnosis of lymphoma was confirmed by ocular histopathology in two dogs and one cat; nonocular cytopathology corroborated lymphoma in another three dogs and five cats. Lymphoma was not evident on aqueous cytopathology but confirmed on nonocular histopathology in two dogs and by cytopathology in one cat. Additionally, aqueous cytopathology in three cats suggested, but was not considered diagnostic of, lymphoma; one of these cats had a confirmatory diagnosis of lymphoma on subsequent clinical investigation. Aqueous humor cytopathology alone was not diagnostic in non-neoplastic anterior uveitis cases, but supplemented the clinical picture with other systemic diagnostic tests. No clinically important complications were reported in association with aqueocentesis. Conclusions Aqueocentesis is performed readily with minimal risk.

In a clinical setting, the technique is used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including the investigation of anterior uveitis, as a means to rapidly reduce intraocular pressure and for intracameral injection of drugs. 1 Clinicopathologic and cytopathologic evaluation of aqueocentesis samples has been reported to be of variable and often low diagnostic utility, primarily for intraocular neoplasia, in several previous studies. [2] [3] [4] [5] However, each of these studies had limitations including a small number of animals sampled, 2 sampling only in those animals in which intraocular neoplasia was not suspected, 3 case selection criteria and number of animals selected not being described, 4 and aqueocentesis sampling being performed only in cases where a prior systemic diagnostic workup failed to establish an etiologic diagnosis. 5 The aims of this retrospective study were to assess the safety of obtaining aqueocentesis samples in anterior uveitis cases, to describe the results obtained and to determine their diagnostic value. It was of particular interest to investigate the accuracy and clinical application with regard to diagnosis of lymphoma, as anecdotal opinion at this referral institution considered aqueocentesis to be useful in identifying lymphoma, yet previous studies have only sparsely documented this in canine patients and, for feline patients, it is not yet validated.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 412, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 622, "end": 625, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 626, "end": 629, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 634, "end": 637, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 813, "end": 814, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 891, "end": 892, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1036, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Clinical cases of anterior uveitis in dogs and cats were from a single referral institution which routinely incorporates aqueocentesis as a diagnostic test to complement appropriate imaging modalities and other laboratory testing.

A second search was performed using the database at Powell Torrance Diagnostic Services (PTDS), the on-site laboratory responsible for handling and analyzing all DVS aqueous samples from 2008 onwards, to ensure correlation and inclusion of all cases. Signalment (species, breed, age, neuter status), presenting complaint and history provided by owner and referring veterinary surgeon, any prior medications, and the hospital service to which the patient presented were documented by a clinical record search of these cases. Ophthalmological examination was performed in all cases by an ECVO board-certified ophthalmologist or resident-in-training, prior to performing aqueocentesis.

Rebound tonometry (Tonovet; Icare, TOWN, Helsinki, Finland) was performed preferentially in all cases from 2011 onwards and applanation tonometry (Tono-Pen Vet; Reichert, Buffalo, New York, USA) prior to this. Ancillary testing such as gonioscopy or fluorescein staining was performed in selected cases where determined appropriate by the attending ophthalmologist.

Cello had previously described anterior uveitis in 60% of canine lymphoma cases exhibiting ocular signs plus histopathological evidence that uveitis in lymphoma was accompanied by tumor cell invasion in a perivascular manner. 8 A histologic review of intraocular and periocular lymphoma by Ota-Kuroki revealed that B-cell phenotype lymphoma with a histopathological intermediate to high grade was identified more commonly than Tcell. 9 Krohne advised further evaluation of the relationship between ocular and hematopoietic disease, including consistent use of anterior chamber aspirates, and Ota-Kuroki suggested that cytopathology should be performed as essentially as ocular and complete physical examination plus complete blood cell count.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 148, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 340, "end": 341, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 686, "end": 687, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 894, "end": 895, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It is important that aqueocentesis results are always considered in the context of clinical history, general physical examination, and all ancillary investigations. Two feline samples in this study were interpreted as 'possible' lymphoma, one of which had blood testing performed solely and the other having thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound. However, in neither did clinical progression support a diagnosis of lymphoma. PARR analysis of clonality would have provided a useful adjunct in these cases, to reduce the inherent subjectivity on both the part of the attending ophthalmologist and pathologist. While morphological features on cytopathology may differentiate a polyclonal lymphoid proliferation from a neoplastic, monoclonal one, assessment and demonstration of clonality by molecular genetic analysis of rearranged antigen receptor genes has been developed to provide a more objective identification of lymphoid neoplasia. 10,11 PCRbased tests are readily applicable for aqueous samples as they are rapid, exquisitely sensitive, and applicable to small quantities of DNA, such as the material obtained from aqueocentesis and cyto-centrifuge. Pate reported a single canine B-cell lymphoma case diagnosed using PARR performed on aqueous humor in 2011. 12 In our retrospective testing of canine aqueous slides, insufficient cellular material was present in 3/6 samples and was in part attributed to the storage conditions, as these had not been intended for the future PARR analysis. Assessment of clonality is also only usefully interpreted in concert with the morphological and clinical findings and cannot be used solely to diagnose neoplasia although it can clarify an equivocal or possible lymphoma result, that is, a predominantly lymphocytic population may be an atypical inflammatory response or lymphoma. To better assess the validity of performing PARR on aqueous, we are undertaking to more routinely perform this, pending initial cytopathology results, when investigating anterior uveitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1272, "end": 1274, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Three dogs with a final diagnosis of lymphoma were not identified on aqueous cytopathology.

One feline case, sampled concurrently with an attempted iris aspirate, was too low in cellularity, yet ophthalmic examination had also not revealed aqueous flare. Performing the procedure where no macroscopic ocular changes are observed may be contraindicated or not improve disease detection, although further study would be required to confirm this. This may also have affected the results in Wiggans' study, where 1/12 dogs and 2/10 cats exhibited no aqueous flare, hyphema, hypopyon, or fibrin and was consistent with low cytopathological harvest on aqueous cytopathology. 5 This study has inherent limitations of a clinical retrospective, with sometimes incomplete histopathology and case follow-up. A prospective study would further determine the diagnostic utility of aqueocentesis, including improved analysis of specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of disseminated neoplasia. Increased use of microorganism PCR testing of aqueous may also be useful, as dictated by geographic location and associated endemic infectious diseases.
