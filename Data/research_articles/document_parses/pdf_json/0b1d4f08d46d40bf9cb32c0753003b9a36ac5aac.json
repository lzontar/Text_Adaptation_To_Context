As there is currently very limited research evidence on how to best deliver this screening, it is not surprising that there are noticeable differences between their recommendations. This paper compares the screening pathways recommended by these guidelines, in the light of the emerging evidence. It proposes the more liberal use of viral testing for improving detection of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic fertility patients. It also argues that a negative test result on symptomatic individuals should not be over-relied upon for allowing the treatment to proceed. In these cases, a low threshold for cancellation may still need to be maintained.",

            "text": "Developing risk assessment strategies against COVID-19 for the fertility services presents with unique challenges. The very nature of fertility treatment involves a number of necessary face-to-face interactions which extend over a timeframe of weeks. This requires continual reaffirming of good health, not just a single assessment. It also demands prompt investigation of the potential risk, followed by decisions-to conclude or cancel the treatment-which are often backed by limited evidence. Ideally, a reliable and sensitive point-of-care diagnostic tool for COVID-19 could address most of these challenges effectively. However, at the time of writing this paper, no such tool is readily available for use in the reproductive medicine field [1] . As a result, fertility scientific societies currently suggest combining tools for assessing the risk of exposure to the virus, with some noticeable differences among their recommendations.",

Other risk factors, such as working in healthcare, are emerging; however, the odds of acquiring the virus occupationally are difficult to quantify and are influenced by type of activity, use of protective equipment and opportunity [7] . Only the ASRM guideline comments that the risk of exposure is also influenced by geographical differences in viral prevalence. However, geographical variations in the prevalence of the virus are not limited to the USA but prevail worldwide [8] . Interestingly, a COVID-19 self-assessment electronic application already incorporates the geographical factor (within the USA) in the decisionmaking [9] . Similar tools designed with fertility processes in mind could be soon integrated into fertility practice. Until then, reproductive medicine clinics may need to monitor and react to trends in viral prevalence within their catchment area.",

In contrast, BFS/ARCS advocates a more cautious approach, by recommending routine testing at the beginning of treatment as well as before any procedure, with added (selective) testing in the presence of symptoms or risk. The latter guidance from BFS/ARCS is more in line with the emerging knowledge about transmission of the virus, aiming to detect the subgroups of infected patients who have very mild or no symptoms. Some of the asymptomatic ones will be at the 'incubating' stage, only to become symptomatic during or just after the completion of fertility treatment. These 'incubators' may already shed a high viral load [10] . Other patients may be asymptomatic throughout but obviously still be contagious. Early reports indicate 18-31% to be truly asymptomatic [11] [12] [13] .",

Obviously, testing technology is still evolving, and currently, it cannot guarantee to detect all the carriers [1] . There are also resource and financial considerations, particularly if the test is to be frequently repeated. Moreover, the absolute benefit-extra number of positive cases detectedmay be arguably limited if routine testing is applied on a lowrisk population (although this can only be proven retrospectively). Notwithstanding the aforementioned uncertainties, regular viral testing (as supported by the BFS/ARCS) has the potential to achieve higher and earlier detection of infected cases, thereby reducing the overall risk of transmission. Taking into account the relatively high morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, this could translate to saving more lives. This technology is expected to become even more reliable in the near future.",

Interestingly, there is difference of opinion on how symptoms should be managed. BFS/ARCS advocates that symptoms should prompt viral testing-as long as time allows-with the result of this test determining whether to cancel or not.

Realistically, it would be difficult to justify allowing a febrile coughing patient to enter the fertility clinic or have a fertility-related procedure. Non-specific symptoms, such as a sore throat, nasal discharge, feeling unwell, loss of smell and taste or mildly elevated temperature, may still be challenging to manage though. In these more subtle cases, the guidance supports performing a viral detection test to guide the decision-making. However, as already argued, a single negative result should not exclude infection. Therefore, in symptomatic patients, it may be safer to cancel a cycle altogether regardless of the severity of symptoms, unless perhaps there is time for repeated testing. The guidelines do not elaborate on this uncomfortable scenario but imply that the decision should be based on an individual risk assessment [4] . In practical terms, reproductive medicine clinicians may not feel confident about quantifying the risk of an individual patient being infected, and there may be no ready access to an experienced physician. In these cases, it may come down to the 'flexibility' of individual clinic policies and the confidence clinicians place on their locally available COVID-19 testing.",

Unsurprisingly, currently published screening pathways rely heavily on expert opinion and are subject to change with time. In the absence of reliable research evidence, clinics must therefore aim to internally monitor the ongoing risk associated with their COVID-19 policies. Prospectively auditing COVID-19 outcomes is paramount, as this will instil confidence in the clinic's policies and inform future restriction or relaxation of the screening protocols.",
