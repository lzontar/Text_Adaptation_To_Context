However, the pandemic is still evolving and the observation at this stage might be misleading. 4 A low possibility of contracting the virus because of fewer outdoor activities and lesser international travel has been suggested as the possible reason for the lower COVID-19 incidence among children as compared to adults. 7 Alternatively, the difference in distribution, maturation, and functioning of the ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has also been postulated as the potential mechanism for the varied age-related incidences. 8 Nevertheless, these speculations lack solid evidence and further studies will be needed to elucidate the mechanisms. Moreover, given the high rate of mildly severe diseases and asymptomatic infections in children, the seroprevalence studies after an outbreak in a confined region will be critical for the comprehensive understanding of the age-related susceptibility to COVID-19. The susceptibility data along with the age-related immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will provide valuable information for combating this potentially lethal and emerging infection.",
