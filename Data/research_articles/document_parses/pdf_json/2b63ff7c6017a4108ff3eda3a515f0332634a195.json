For example, Liu et al. (1) analyzed meteorological data of 30 cities in China and suggested that low temperature, mild diurnal temperatures, and low humidity likely aid the transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) . Shi et al. (2) also suggested that the incidence of COVID-19 decreases with an increase in temperature. Qi et al. (3) further showed that both temperature and humidity were negative associated with COVID-19. Using the similar meteorological data of 122 cities in China, however, Xie and Zhu (4) found no evidence to support that theory that the number of COVID-19 cases would reduce when the weather became warmer. They even showed a positive correlation between temperature and COVID-19 cases in that 1 \u2022 C rise in the mean temperature (when <3 \u2022 C) was associated with a 4.9% increase in the daily confirmed cases. Also, with meteorological data in China, Yao et al. (5) demonstrated that neither ambient temperature nor ultraviolet radiation has a significant impact on the transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2. For countries outside of China, there are also a large number of contradictory reports. Bashir et al. (6) found that average temperature, minimum temperature, and air quality were significantly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, USA, although the correlations were complex. In Jakarta, Indonesia, Tosepu et al. (7) demonstrated that the average temperature was indicated to be significantly correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the city of Barcelona, Spain, Tob\u00edasa and Molina (8) further indicated that a 1 \u2022 C increase of max temperature reduced a decrease in the incidence rate by 7.5% on the same day. However, also in Spain, Briz-Red\u00f3na and Serrano-Arocab (9) found no significant relationship between COVID-19 cases and the temperatures. In addition, Jahangiri et al. (10) indicated that the transmission rate of the COVID-19 exhibited a low sensibility to the changes in the ambient temperature in Iran.",

            "text": "What is the reason behind these contradictory findings? One reason is the different types of data included in the analyses. Some researchers collected counts of confirmed cases or new cases or total cases, but other researchers calculated the cumulative incidence rate. Different places (cities) have different population sizes and population densities. Considering that the population size significantly regulates the spread rate of COVID-19 (10) , and the incidence rate per unit population may reflect the epidemics more accurately. The basic numbers of infected people in the center and border of epidemic areas are much different from those in areas of sporadic outbreak; that is to say, the infection probabilities of different areas are different. Therefore, it will be helpful to distinguish concentrated-outbreak areas with sporadic-outbreak areas when studying the role of environmental factors on COVID-19. For example, Shi et al. (2) counted confirmed cases in Wuhan and regions other than Wuhan in Hubei Province separately. (c) The time period selected for the research is also important. For example, after February 15, new cases in China have shown a downward trend and a gradual rise in temperature. We cannot thus conclude that the temperature was negatively correlated with new case numbers (1). There usually exits a bell curve in an epidemic. Researchers should focus on epidemic data and climate data only in the platform period ideally rather than in the exponential period or in the recession period. The platform period may provide the highest resolution data set for determining correlations between environmental conditions and COVID-19 transmission, and refraining from collection of data before and after would be irresponsible and could lead to missed opportunities to understand how outbreaks begin and resolve. The spread of the virus is also influenced by human factors, such as efficiency of case finding and contact tracing, quarantine strategy, implementation ability of COVID-19 control policy, urbanization rate, and availability of medical resources. How to normalize these complex epidemic data poses a great challenge to the researchers. The temperature and humidity ranges included in the current studies have often been small, such as the temperature range from 0 to 20 \u2022 C in most China cities from January to March (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . The survivability of airborne viruses begins to decrease only when the temperature is more than 30 \u2022 C (11, 12) . Efficiency of the influenza virus transmission has been found to be dependent on relative humidity (RH) at 20 \u2022 C but independent of air humidity at 30 \u2022 C (11). The novel coronavirus may also apply to this rule. Maybe a global scale research will be able to obtain more accurate data of larger ranges of temperature and humidity.",

For example, correlation coefficients acquired from the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, USA, were as low as 0.25-0.4 (6) . The correlation coefficient between average temperature and COVID-19 pandemic in Jakarta, Indonesia, was only 0.392 (7) . The high level of virus shedding and long viral persistence in aerosols may be main reasons. High levels of the virus in throat swabs have been observed in COVID-19 patients [either symptomatic or asymptomatic; (13, 14) ]. It is worth noticing that the peak viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was more than 1,000 times higher than SARS-CoV-1, and active SARS-CoV-2 replication in upper respiratory tract tissues has been found, where SARS-CoV-1 is not thought to replicate at this site (13) . The half-lives of SARS (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 were almost the same in aerosols with averages of about 1.1-1.2 h (15), which is, however, about two times the half-life of influenza viruses [31.6 min; (16) ]. Thus, for SARS-CoV-2, 1-h half-life might be enough long for an effective transmission, where temperature or humidity only exerts a week influence to the viral persistence.",

It is also proposed that, under dry but cool indoor environments, such as in winter, low humidity allows viral aerosols persist for a longer time in air because of their smaller sizes, thus increasing the spread of the virus. In warm areas, however, the relatively-low temperature and near-saturation humidity during the rainy season facilitate the spread of the virus via large aerosol particles (12) . A recent study reported that a COVID-19 patient had transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to eight healthy contacts through bathing at a bath center, implying that the cluster spread of the virus could still arise in a condition of warm (hot) and near-saturation humidity (21) . The viral transmission pattern under near-saturation humidity is rarely studied, highlighting a necessary area for future investigations.",

Although the midday temperatures in these areas are usually >20 \u2022 C (or even > 30 \u2022 C), the night temperature may below 10 \u2022 C (especially at high altitudes), which may facilitate the spread of the virus. The influenza virus can survive for more than 24 h in the environment of 23-25% RH and 7-8 \u2022 C (22) . Considering the longer half-life of SARS-CoV-2, the novel SARS-like coronavirus may survive for several days under a cool and arid condition. A recent report indicated that inhalation of dry air (20% RH, compared with 50% RH) impairs mucociliary clearance, the innate antiviral defense against influenza virus infections (23) . In other words, the arid condition may not only increase the persistence of the viral but may also compromise the host's immunity.",
