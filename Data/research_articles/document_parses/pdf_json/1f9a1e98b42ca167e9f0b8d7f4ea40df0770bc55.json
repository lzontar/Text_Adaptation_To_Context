These tests will also better define the risk of fatality due to COVID-19 by better identifying those who have been infected.

Four of these human coronaviruses (HCoVs)-HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1-usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory illness (eg, the common cold) in people. These 4 viruses continually circulate in the human population and cause respiratory infections in adults and children worldwide. 1 However, 3 more recent coronaviruses can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) with more serious outcomes in people, including death. The first definition of COVID-19 was based solely on signs and symptoms of the infection (principally fever, cough, and shortness of breath) and ruling out other possible causes, particularly negative tests for influenza. This approach is still common but has been enhanced by a test to detect active shedding of the COVID-19 virus in respiratory specimens, mainly via upper nasal swabs. These tests use real time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Diagnostics Panels. 5,6 A real-time RT-PCR is a diagnostic laboratory test that is used to measure the amount of a specific type of RNA, such as the RNA associated with the COVID-19 virus, as a means of detecting the presence of that virus. It involves reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and then amplification of specific DNA targets using a polymerase chain reaction. The use of these tests moves the diagnosis from one based on symptoms and excluding other possible causes to a diagnosis based on a finding confirming that the individual is shedding COVID-19 virus.",

Second, a negative test in someone who is asymptomatic is of limited value, because the individual could be too early in the disease process to test positive (the incubation period can be from 2 to 14 days after becoming infected), but, more importantly, because the asymptomatic individual may not have been exposed to the virus at the time of the testing but could be exposed even later that day and subsequently become positive. Therefore, for both reasons, the test is generally reserved for individuals who are meaningfully symptomatic. In other words, a negative test does not mean that an individual is safe going forward. An exception to the general rule is to test even asymptomatic individuals who have been in close contact with an active COVID-19 patient. Testing such individuals may detect the presence of virus before they become symptomatic-and some will never become symptomatic but they can still infect others.",
