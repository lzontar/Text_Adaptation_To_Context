In this retrospective analysis, conducted at the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, it is reported that heparin treatment reduces mortality in subjects affected by severe COVID-19 who have \"sepsis-induced coagulopathy\". The definition of severe COVID-19 was the presence of at least one of following: respiratory rate \u226530 breaths /min; arterial oxygen saturation \u226493% at rest; PaO2/FiO2 \u2264300 mmHg. The Authors of this study also reported that, among subjects not treated with heparin, mortality raised according with D-dimer levels. Of note, patients that received heparin in this study were mostly treated with enoxaparin, at the thromboprophylactic dose of 40-60 mg/day, for at least 7 days.",

Considering that these patients had respiratory failure, were likely bedridden for oxygen supplementation, and had an acute respiratory infection, their PADUA score 2 was necessarily \u22654, without even taking into account the possibility that some of them could have cancer, history of previous VTE, and age >70 years. Based on this, it is possible to hypothesize that, among the 350 patients that did not receive heparin (or were treated for less than 7 days), some developed pulmonary embolism (EP), which could have contributed to mortality in this group. Such hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that mortality correlates with D-dimer levels among heparin non-users, although we are aware that high D-dimer levels may be due to many factors in COVID-19 patients and do not necessarily depend on the presence of VTE.",
