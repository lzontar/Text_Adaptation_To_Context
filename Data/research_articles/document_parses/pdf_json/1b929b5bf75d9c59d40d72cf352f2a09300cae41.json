Emergent measures and policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts (e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like \"stay safe home\" are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as \"people death\" are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has influenced millions of people around the world [20] .

It is reported that the globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 have surpassed 10 milloin and more than 500,000 people have lost their lives due to the infection until 29 June 2020 3 . Many countries and jurisdictions have taken a series of specific measures to help to slow down the spread of COVID-19, such as travel ban, lockdown, closure of public places (e.g., gym, restaurants, schools), requiring people to practise good personal hygiene, keep physical social distancing of 1.5 meters, and work or study at home to reduce contact with others. The above measures have changed people's daily lives, and most people have to follow the policies to protect the safety of their communities. However, many mental symptoms like worry, fear, frustration, depression and anxiety could occur and cause serious mental heath issues to people due to the long-time social activity restriction during the pandemic period [24] .

Nowadays, SA techniques are quite mature and many tools are openly available, such as Stanford's CoreNLP [14] , VADER [12] , SentiStrength [19] , SentiCircles [17] , which are specifically designed for social media conversation. In this work, we employ VADER to identify the sentiment polarity of each tweet. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiment expressed in social media. It was introduced by Hutto et al.in 2014 and has been widely used in many social media text sentiment analysis tasks [7, 5, 9, 23, 18, 24] . VADER can classify the sentiment into negative, neutral, and positive categories and employ compound score which is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon and normalized in range (-1,1), where \"-1\" represents most extreme negative and \"1\" represents most extreme positive. If compound score is greater than 0.05, the text is considered positive, if the score is less than -0.05, it is considered negative, if the score is between 0.05 and -0.05, the text polarity is neutral. The biggest advantage of VADER is that it does not require data preprocessing and model training, and can be used directly on the raw tweet to generate sentiment polarity. Some examples of tweet sentiment results from VADER are shown in figure 2 . In this work, we use VADER to produce the sentiment polarity of each original tweet, namely positive, negative and neutral.
