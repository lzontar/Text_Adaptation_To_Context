As the discipline has evolved, so have the available techniques to this end. Consider, for example, situations where the underlying data distribution changes resulting in a concept drift. Traditional batch learners were incapable of adapting to such drifts. Online learning algorithms were devised [6] to succeed in this task by iteratively updating their knowledge according to the data shifts. In other situations, it is not the data that change but the business needs themselves. For instance, fraud detection algorithms [7] are regularly retrained to incorporate new types of fraud. Commercial machine learning applications are designed to answer very specific business objectives that may evolve in time. Take, for example, the case where a company wants to focus on a new client portfolio. This may require evolving from a binary classification setting to a multi-class configuration [8] . Under such circumstances, the operational point of a trained classifier can be changed to adapt it to the new policy. Alternatively, it is also possible to add patches in the form of wrappers to already deployed models. These endow models with new traits or functionalities that help them adapt to the new data conditions, either globally [9] or locally [10] .",

In this context, we want to learn a new solution for the same task and for a new target scenario defined by the set of feasibility constraints C t , where C t = C s .

However, there might be no overlapping between the set of constraints C t and the set of models defined by H s . This implies that no model of that hypothesis space can be considered a solution. In such cases, adaptation involves definition of a new hypothesis space H t altogether. Take, for example, the case of an application with a multivariate Gaussian kernel support vector machine.

This is possible when the new model hypothesis space H t is required to provide feasible solutions for the constraint set C t . However, it is worth considering the costs of this approach. In general, rebuilding a model from scratch (i) implies obtaining the clearance from legal, business, ethical, and engineering departments, (ii) does not guarantee that a good or better solution of the objective function will be achieved 1 , (iii) requires a whole new iteration of the machine learning pipeline, which is costly and time-consuming, (iv) assumes full access to the training dataset, which may no longer be available or require a very complex version control process. Plus, in many companies machine learning solutions are kept up-to-date using automated systems that continuously evaluate and retrain models; a technique known as continuous learning. Note, however, that this may take huge storage space, due to the need to save all the new incoming information. Hence, in the best case scenario, re-training is an expensive and difficult approach that assumes a certain level of knowledge that is not always guaranteed.

In this scenario, each data sample in the original training set is augmented using information from the parent decision behavior. For example, a sample can be enriched by adding additional features using the prediction results of a set of classifiers. Alternatively, if instead of learning hard targets one considers using the output of the parent's class probability outputs or logits as soft-targets, this richer information can be exploited to build a new generation that is closer in behavior to the parent. Under this category fall methods like model distillation [12, 16, 17, 18] , as well as techniques such as label regularization [19, 20] and label refinery [21] . In general, this form of inheritance requires access to the source model and is performed under the assumption of full knowledge of the training data.",

To tackle this issue of environmental adaptation, we have proposed a mechanism inspired in how biological organisms evolve: differential replication. Differential replication allows machine learning models to modify their behavior to meet the new requirements defined by the environment. We envision this replication mechanism as a projection operator able to translate the decision behavior of a machine learning model into a new hypothesis space with different characteristics. This allows traits of a given classifier to be inherited by another, more suitable under the new premises. We have listed different inheritance mechanisms to achieve this goal, depending on specific knowledge availability scenarios. These range from the more permissive inheritance by sharing the dataset to the more restrictive inheritance by copying, which is the solution requiring less knowledge about the parent model and training data. Finally, we provide examples of how differential replication applies in practice for six different real-life scenarios.",
