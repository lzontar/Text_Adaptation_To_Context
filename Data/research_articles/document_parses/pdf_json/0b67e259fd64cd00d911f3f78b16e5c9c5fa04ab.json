To date, different methods have been used for viral titration depending on the virus concerned.

They are used for cytopathic viruses (e.g. HIV-1, poliovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, measles virus, etc\u2026) and are based on serial dilutions of the viruscontaining samples and observation of the appearance of a cytopathic effect (CPE) in a cell monolayer. The PFU technique measures the number of virus particles capable of forming plaques per volume unit, and accounts for the replication potency of the virions, i.e. it is a functional measure. The PFU assay is laborious, poorly automatable, and requires several hours to several days according to the speed of virus growth and propagation. It also suffers from subjectivity because of the tedious manual plaque counting and possible plaque-like defects in the cell monolayer.

However, at a too high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (i.e. the ratio of infectious virus particle per cell) such an assumption becomes erroneous, leading to an underestimation of virus titers.

Example: for virus volumes 0.3 ml, 1 ml, 3 ml and 10 ml the percentage of infected cells was 15.3%, 43.7%, 72.4% and 96.3%, respectively. Therefore the virus titer (as average) was calculated from the 2 lowest flow cytometry values and was 7.75 Log IU/ml (which corresponds to (7.74 Log IU/ml for 15.3%+7.76 Log IU/ml for 43.7%)/2 = 7.75).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 193, "end": 197, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 198, "end": 202, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 782, "end": 787, "text": "(7.74", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Application for titration of HIV-1 based lentivectors"}, {"text": "In comparison with other flow-cytometry based methods described previously to titer different viruses [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , our technique appears original and complementary in several aspects: (i) a complete set of critical parameters has been fully explored and experimentally validated; (ii) our method is the first one to describe a flow-cytometry based procedure to determine the duration of a single virus replication cycle, a key parameter for titration accuracy, and (iii) the first rapid method for quantifying different measles virus strains; (iv) adjustments of critical parameters allowed its use to titer two other unrelated viruses, VSV and HIV-1; (v) by applying the Poisson law the titer calculation appeared to be very precise and highly reproducible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 102, "end": 105, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 106, "end": 109, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 110, "end": 113, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 114, "end": 117, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 118, "end": 121, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 122, "end": 125, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 126, "end": 129, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 130, "end": 134, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 135, "end": 139, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 140, "end": 144, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 145, "end": 149, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Comparison with other available virus titration methods"}, {"text": "Compared to the PFU method and TCID50, the flow cytometry based method has the advantage of being rapid which might be crucial in vaccine production and when short deadlines in research laboratories should be met. Moreover, it could be used to titer non-replicative virus particles (e.g. lentiviral vectors), and a large number of virus samples may be compared simultaneously thanks to limited handling and high precision. However, there are two major limitations: (i) the detection limit is 10 4 IU/ml, which prevents its use for titration of clinical samples that often have a low virus load, and (ii) it is not recommended for viruses (mutants, etc.) with replication cycles exceeding more than 2 days. Alternative methods have been designed based on the measure of either the genome content of a viral suspension [12] or cellassociated viral nucleic acids by quantitative real-time PCR after end point dilution of the infecting virus (PCR infectivity assay) [29] [30] . However, the obtained viral nucleic acid values have to be calibrated using an infectious virus reference, and any change in the [nucleic acid/infectious unit] ratio prevents the accurate determination of the number of infectious particles.

Furthermore, it could be easily automated [31] . Titers obtained through this technique correlate significantly with those determined by the classical TCID50 method but with higher accuracy and a 3-fold lower range of confidence limit. Such a method may be particularly beneficial for studies requiring titration of large numbers of MV stocks and especially when strict deadlines should be respected. In principle this method can be adapted to titer any virus for which a viral protein can be easily detected by flow cytometry, including recombinant viruses carrying a fluorescent reporter gene (or any gene encoding a cell surface protein that could be immunolabelled) and the use of indicator cells with an endogenous reporter gene that is inducible upon virus infection (see Table 1 for setting up steps of a new virus titration assay). The method is not suitable for titration of viruses (e.g. recombinant viruses, mutants, etc.) which replication cycle takes more than 30 h unless the cell proliferation is prevented. Indeed, the accuracy of virus titration critically relies on the precision of seeded cell number that is used in the formulae to calculate the titer. Any significant cell growth during the assay may result in the underestimation virus titer because infected cells usually grow slower than uninfected cells. This method could prove useful to titrate HIV and HIV molecular clones designed to undergo a single viral cycle. Moreover, this method also allows determination of the duration of a virus replication cycle, a key parameter for the accuracy of the virus titration. 3. Perform titration of your viral stock using an already described and validated method, i.e. TCID50. Note the titre. 4. Define the single replication cycle by analyzing the flow cytometry histograms: note the time point where the peak of the second virus input starts to approach and overlap the peak of the first (highest) virus input) 5. Correlate the data from point 2, 3 and 4 above. The duration of the replication cycle should correspond to the time point where the slope of the time course is close to 0.
