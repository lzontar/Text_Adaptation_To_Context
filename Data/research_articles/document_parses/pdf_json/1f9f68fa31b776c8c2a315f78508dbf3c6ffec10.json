The disease caused by this virus has been named corona virus disease 2019 . In order to identify COVID-19 patients highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools are important. Up to now, COVID-19 diagnosis is mainly based on PCR results and the respective specimens are usually obtained from the upper or lower respiratory tract 4, 5 . However, the sensitivity of PCR has its limitations and we and others have observed false-negative PCR results in the past [6] [7] [8] . The sensitivity of chest CT seems to be somewhat higher 9 . However, radiologic findings are not highly specific for COVID-19, as other viruses or diseases can cause similar radiologic phenomena 10 . A further diagnostic option is the detection of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (e.g. the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) in patients sera 11 .",

A close relative of the patient was only recently (about 2 weeks before the patient's Accepted Article admission) diagnosed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Laboratory findings included a slight elevation of c-reactive protein (CRP: 26mg/L; normal range: <5mgl/L) and d-dimer levels (390 ng/mL; normal range: < 250 ng/mL), with a normal procalcitonine level (PCT: 0.11 ng/mL; normal range: <2 ng/mL). Importantly, white blood cell counts and lymphocyte counts were in a normal range (WBC: 6.0/nL; normal range: 4.3-10/nL; lymphocytes: 42.8%; normal range: 20.5-51.1%), and high sensitive troponin was slightly elevated (42 pg/mL; normal range: <14pg/mL). We suspected COVID-19 pneumonia and performed a chest CT scan as well as a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing (Real Star SARS-CoV-2 PCR Kit, altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). The CT scan showed only minimal changes, namely a very small and discrete ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe ( figure 1A) . SARS-CoV-2 PCR came up with a negative result. Thus, at this point, we could not truly confirm the suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia (despite the history of a close contact to a SARS-CoV-2 positive relative).",

However, after an initial improvement, fever persisted. We performed an antipyretic treatment with paracetamol. Blood cultures, urine cultures, cultures from qualified sputum, and laboratory screening for atypical pneumonia (legionella, mycoplasma, and chlamydia) remained negative.

He developed a lymphocytopenia (WBC: 6.0/nl, lymphocytes: 14.1 %) and an increase in CRP levels (164.8 mg/L). We performed another chest CT at day 13 after admission. This CT scan showed bilateral, multilobular ground glass opacities and crazy paving with a predominant peripheral and posterior distribution, as well as beginning consolidations, consistent with the diagnosis of a viral pneumonia (figure 1). At day 14, we collected patient's serum for SARS-CoV-2 antibody (IgA and IgG) detection and a specimen from lower respiratory tract (deep tracheal aspiration) for PCR. Again, the PCR was negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, the serologic testing by an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISA (EUROIMMUN AG, Luebeck, Germany), came up with a highly positive ratio for both, IgG and IgA. These clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings finally led to the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. During the further disease course, the patient received a supportive treatment, which consisted of a careful fluid substitution (with crystalloids) and antipyretic medication (with paracetamol). Further, the patient received oxygen supplementation as required.",

The chest CT, performed on admission, only showed a very discrete ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe. However, the patient's history and clinical presentation were suggestive for COVID-19 diagnosis. Clinical and laboratory findings, a second chest CT, and the detection of high levels of IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.Educational points from this case: CT scans were performed at day 1 (left side), day 13 (middle), and day 21 (right side) after the admission. At day 1, only a very discrete ground glass nodule was found in the left upper lobe (white arrows). A second CT scan at day 13 revealed multilobular ground glass opacities and consolidations with peripheral and bilateral involvement of the lung. The CT-scan at day 21 shows an improvement of these CT-findings.",
