These receptors trigger inflammatory responses, activate innate immune responses, and prime adaptive immune responses to eradicate invading microbes [1] . TLR are members of a family of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize molecular structures of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs), as well as endogenous structures and proteins released during inflammation (damage/danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs). To date, ten different TLR have been identified in humans and twelve in mice. TLR are expressed on all cells of the immune system, but also on parenchymal cells of many organs and tissues. The binding of a PAMP to a TLR results in cellular activation and initiates a variety of effector functions, including cytokine secretion, proliferation, co-stimulation or phagocyte maturation. To facilitate microbial recognition and to amplify cellular responses, certain TLR require additional proteins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), CD14, CD36 and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1). In this chapter, the role of CD14 as an accessory receptor for TLR in lung inflammation and infection is discussed. The central role of CD14 in the recognition of various PAMPs and amplification of immune and inflammatory responses in the lung is depicted in Figure 1 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 315, "end": 318, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1512, "end": 1520, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "CD14 was characterized as a receptor for bacterial endotoxin (LPS) in 1990, almost a decade before the discovery and characterization of TLR, and can be regarded as the first described pattern-recognition receptor [2] .

The genomic DNA of human CD14 was cloned in 1988 and the gene was later mapped to chromosome 5q23 -31.

The CD14 protein is composed of eleven leucin-rich repeats, which are also found in TLR and which are important in PAMP binding. Moreover, the crystal structure of CD14 revealed that the protein has a 'horse-shoe' shape, similar to TLR4, and that LPS is bound within the pocket [4] . In contrast to TLR, however, CD14 lacks a transmembrane domain, and thus cannot initiate intracellular signal transduction by itself. The CD14 protein is processed in the endoplasmatic reticulum and expressed as a 55 kDa glycoprotein on the cell sur- Central role of CD14 in pathogen-and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced responses in the lung. CD14, which lacks an intracellular domain for signal transduction, is expressed on the surface of alveolar macrophages, infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils, and at lower levels also on epithelial and endothelial cells in the lung. CD14 recognizes and binds various structures from invading microbes, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Grampositive bacteria, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from mycobacteria, viral double stranded (ds) RNA and F glycoprotein (F-gp) from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). CD14 subsequently transfers these bound components to Toll-like receptors (TLR) which than trigger cell activation. Binding of LPS to CD14 is regulated by additional accessory receptors in the lung, including LPS-binding protein (LBP) and a number of surfactant proteins (SP). Furthermore, soluble CD14 (sCD14) enhances LPS-induced activation of cells with low CD14 expression. Depending on the microbe and the PAMPs it expresses, CD14-amplified responses can either be beneficial to the host by induction of an adequate inflammatory and immune response to eradicate the invading microbe, or detrimental to the host by excessive inflammation and/or dissemination of the pathogen.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 397, "end": 400, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "face via a glycosylphosphatidyl (GPI) anchor [5] .

Gram-negative bacteria that fail to add the core polysaccharide or the O-polysaccharide chain to the lipid A moiety produce 'rough' LPS, named after the rough morphology of the colonies these bacteria form. Lipid A, the bioactive part of both smooth and rough LPS, is responsible for most of the pathogenic effects in Gram-negative bacterial infections [7, 12] . Murine macrophages lacking CD14 secreted equal amounts of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) to macrophages expressing CD14 upon stimulation with rough LPS, but failed to secrete TNF in response to smooth LPS, an effect which was reversed by addition of sCD14 [13] .

In contrast, TLR2deficient and TLR4-mutant mice were not protected against pneumococcal pneumonia [38, 42] , but in fact TLR2 seemed redundant for efficient bacterial clearance and TLR4-mutant mice were more susceptible to pneumonia, accompanied by impaired bacterial clearance. However, as in CD14-deficient mice, lung inflammation was also reduced in pneumococci-infected TLR2-deficient mice [42] .

The envelop F glycoprotein from RSV and certain influenza A virus components activate macrophages in a CD14-dependent manner [14, 20] . Experiments with wild-type and TLR4-mutant mice infected intranasally with RSV showed that viral clearance was reduced in the absence of functional TLR4 [14] , due to impaired natural killer (NK) cell migration and function and impaired cytokine secretion.

Central role of CD14 in pathogen-and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-induced responses in the lung. CD14, which lacks an intracellular domain for signal transduction, is expressed on the surface of alveolar macrophages, infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils, and at lower levels also on epithelial and endothelial cells in the lung. CD14 recognizes and binds various structures from invading microbes, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Grampositive bacteria, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) from mycobacteria, viral double stranded (ds) RNA and F glycoprotein (F-gp) from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). CD14 subsequently transfers these bound components to Toll-like receptors (TLR) which than trigger cell activation. Binding of LPS to CD14 is regulated by additional accessory receptors in the lung, including LPS-binding protein (LBP) and a number of surfactant proteins (SP). Furthermore, soluble CD14 (sCD14) enhances LPS-induced activation of cells with low CD14 expression. Depending on the microbe and the PAMPs it expresses, CD14-amplified responses can either be beneficial to the host by induction of an adequate inflammatory and immune response to eradicate the invading microbe, or detrimental to the host by excessive inflammation and/or dissemination of the pathogen.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Effect of CD14 'neutralization' in lung inflammation and lung infectionInciting ligand/pathogen Animal model* Effect of CD14 'neutralization' in the lung** Ref.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
