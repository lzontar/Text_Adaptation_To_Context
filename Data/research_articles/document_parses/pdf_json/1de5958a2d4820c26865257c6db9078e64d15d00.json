Therefore, there is often a significant delay between onset of olfactory loss and presentation to a provider's office for evaluation, with one study documenting an average of 3 years between symptom onset and olfactory testing. 8 This delay is likely related to a lack of awareness of this condition among both patients and medical providers.

Whether olfactory loss truly contributes to increased mortality, or is simply an associated factor, is still unknown, but these studies suggest that loss of smell is important, nonetheless. Additionally, there are many studies demonstrating that olfactory dysfunction impacts quality of life, as this loss affects food enjoyment, social interaction, and incidence of depression.

Classically, a patient will lose ability to smell during the course of a viral URI. Most often, the subjective loss of smell will not be realized by the patient until after the infection has resolved. Because smell loss can be insidious, months may go by before they realize there is a problem. Patients may or may not appreciate the relevance of the infection unless asked directly, as not all illnesses are particularly severe or otherwise noteworthy. Because smell informs the flavor of food, patients may also complain of altered taste, describing food as bland. A detailed history would also rule out other causes of ongoing olfactory loss or symptoms that are indicative of more worrisome pathology (Table 1 ). Physical examination for any suspected etiology of smell loss should include nasal endoscopy, usually performed by an otolaryngologist, and would be expected to be normal in cases with viral-associated olfactory loss. Imaging is rarely done unless symptoms and examination suggest an alternative diagnosis such as chronic rhinosinusitis or a mass lesion. Formal smell testing is an important aspect of the evaluation in order to document the precise degree of olfactory loss as compared to population norm which reflects an overall diminishing ability to smell as age advances. The most common forms of smell testing are the Smell Identification Tests and the Sniffin' Sticks battery of tests, the latter of which evaluates threshold, discrimination, and identification. 15 These tests allow the degree of smell loss to be quantified into hyposmia (some smell present but less than normal) and anosmia (no discernible smell). Unfortunately, these tests are not widely available in general otolaryngology offices and thus formal, objective olfactory testing is unlikely to be feasible during or shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic for most patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1576, "end": 1578, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 793, "end": 801, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Presentation and evaluation"}, {"text": "At the time of diagnosis, roughly two-thirds of patients will have hyposmia by testing, and one-third will be anosmic; however, most of this data comes from specialized smell and taste centers and thus may be skewed toward patients who failed to improve. 8 The natural history of viral-associated smell loss is for there to be some degree of spontaneous recovery. The exact degree of improvement is hard to capture on a population level since few patients immediately present to centers capable of testing. Available data suggests that 40-60% of patients will have some spontaneous improvement in the years following initial diagnosis. 8, 16 In one of the largest series, the percentage of anosmic and hyposmic patients exhibiting clinically significant improvement was 46% and 35%, respectively. 16 Unfortunately, only 15% of those who present with anosmia will achieve normal smell levels, whereas 25% of those with hyposmia improve to normal over time. 8", "cite_spans": [{"start": 255, "end": 256, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 636, "end": 638, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 639, "end": 641, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 797, "end": 799, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Natural history"}, {"text": "In typical viral-associated olfactory loss it is assumed there has been direct damage to the olfactory system.

If the vast majority of smell loss cases resolve in a matter of weeks, it could be assumed that the virus caused an inflammatory response in the nasal cavity that temporarily impedes odorants from reaching the olfactory receptor neurons. Damage to olfactory neurons would require a longer period of regeneration and axon regrowth to make useful synapses with the olfactory bulb. In addition, a recent report identifying cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, notes higher levels in respiratory epithelial cells compared to olfactory epithelium. However, olfactory epithelial cells did express ACE2, including supporting cells and horizontal basal cells but not olfactory receptor neurons. 21 Transmission of the virus could occur via other methods and routes potentially damaging the olfactory bulbs directly. For example, intranasal inoculation of mice transgenic for human ACE2 with the SARS-CoV virus results in rapid propagation of viral particles into the olfactory bulb and subsequently other areas of the brain 22 . In any case, making assumptions without hard evidence could be dangerous. During the polio epidemic, wrong assumptions were made that the virus spread through olfactory axons to the brain, which led to purposeful damaging of olfactory epithelium with resulting permanent smell loss. 23 Only later was it realized that transmission occurs through the oral/GI route.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 813, "end": 815, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1144, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1430, "end": 1432, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mechanisms of disease and viral pathogens"}, {"text": "Many different medications have been proposed to treat viral-associated olfactory loss, including oral corticosteroids, topical corticosteroids, zinc sulfate, alpha lipoic acid, theophylline, caroverine, vitamin A, Ginkgo biloba, and minocycline.

The concept behind olfactory training is analogous to physical therapy after a stroke or other neurologic insult. Faced with an injury and resultant deficit, existing neural pathways can be strengthened and \"retrained\" in order to compensate. 26 Otolaryngologists are most familiar with balance therapy for vestibular disease or audiologic training after cochlear implantation. Olfactory training is thought to be similar, retraining the brain to correctly interpret the neurologic signals received as odorants generate unique impulses that travel through the olfactory nerves, olfactory bulb, and olfactory cortex. In addition, animal models have shown an activity-dependent survival of olfactory receptor neurons during development and regeneration. 27, 28 Traditional olfactory training utilizes twice daily training sessions involving 4 odors specifically chosen from distinct chemical classes of odorants. For each odor, the patient inhales through the nostrils for 15 seconds, concentrating on the odor and its intended smell. After a short break of 10 seconds, the next odor is inhaled and the process repeated for all odorants. 29 The duration of therapy is usually a minimum of 6 months, although therapy is often continued longer if the patient is demonstrating progress.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 392, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 899, "end": 902, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 903, "end": 905, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1285, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Olfactory Training"}, {"text": "Studies examining outcomes after olfactory training have consistently demonstrated significant improvements in objective olfactory testing, including those with post-traumatic, post-viral, and agerelated olfactory loss. 30 This includes 2 randomized controlled studies focused specifically on those with viral-associated olfactory loss. 31, 32 These studies both showed more improvement in those undergoing olfactory training versus the control interventions. Damm et al found that olfactory function improved in 15/24 participants (63%) of the high-concentration training group and in 6/31 participants (19%) of the low-concentration training group (P = .03) in subjects with a duration of olfactory dysfunction of <12 months. 31 Altundag et al found improvement with both classic (four different odors) and modified (3 sets of four odors changed every 4 months) olfactory training compared with control, with the greatest improvement with a modified regimen. 32 There are a couple of caveats worth discussing when considering olfactory training for patients with olfactory loss. The first is that expectations should be managed, as it would be rare for olfactory training alone to dramatically improve someone's sense of smell. Therefore, someone with complete anosmia should not on average expect complete normalization. The typical improvement is in the range of 4-6 points on the Sniffin' Sticks composite scale; which is above the minimal clinically important difference but is still nonetheless considered to be a modest improvement. 33 For example, a patient with complete anosmia may regain some smell function but remain subjectively diminished or conversely, a patient with mild hyposmia may potentially improve into normal range. The second point is that many providers recommend \"modified\" olfactory training. Modified olfactory training involves rotating odors periodically, usually monthly or at least every 3 months. At least one study has demonstrated superiority of modified olfactory training over traditional olfactory training and most patients find it more interesting to vary odors to keep the therapy from getting stale. 32 Lastly, actually obtaining odorants to perform training can be a practical limitation. 34 Proprietary smell retraining kits can be purchased, although these are still not widely available nor easy to obtain. For many patients, it is easiest to utilize essential oils or various household items (e.g. coffee, cinnamon, vanilla) for therapy. Providing patients with a list of odorants, instructions for therapy, and a diary to document progress is helpful to augment compliance. Lastly, scheduled follow-up with repeated objective olfactory testing gives patients something to look forward to and a quantifiable way to measure progress.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 220, "end": 222, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 337, "end": 340, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 341, "end": 343, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 728, "end": 730, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 961, "end": 963, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1543, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2145, "end": 2147, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2235, "end": 2237, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Olfactory Training"}, {"text": "1.
