Among these, cryptosporidiosis is an emerging waterborne zoonoses and one of the important causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea. Poor immune response coupled with primary cryptosporidial infections predispose neonatal calves to multiple secondary infections resulting in their deaths. In the present study, faecal samples from 100 diarrhoeic calves randomly picked up out of 17 outbreaks of bovine calf diarrhoea in periurban Ludhiana, Punjab in Northern India were subjected to conventional (microscopy, modified Zeihl-Neelsen (mZN) staining) and immunological and molecular techniques (faecal antigen capture ELISA and PCR) for detection of primary Cryptosporidium parvum infection as well as other frequently reported concurrent pathogens, viz. rotavirus and coronavirus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Eimeria spp. The faecal antigen capture ELISA and PCR revealed 35% prevalence of C. parvum in contrast to 25% by mZN staining with a relatively higher prevalence (66\u00b77%) in younger (8-14-day-old) calves. The detection rate of the other enteropathogens associated with C. parvum was 45\u00b771% for C. perfringens followed by Salmonella spp (40\u00b70%), rotavirus (36\u00b70%), coronavirus (16\u00b70%), E. coli (12\u00b70%) and Eimeria spp (4\u00b70%) The sensitivity for detection of C. parvum by ELISA and mZN staining in comparison to PCR was 97\u00b714% and 72\u00b772%, respectively. An important finding of the study was that C. parvum alone was found in only 10% of the diarrhoeic faecal samples, whereas, majority of the samples (90%) showed mixed infections ranging from a combination of two to five agents.

The Leishman-stained smears proved highly useful in preliminary screening of faecal smears for the presence or absence of coocidia, particularly cryptosporidia. Morphometric analysis of oocysts of Cryptosporidium (n = 10; 10 field each sample) in Leishman (4\u00b724 \u00b1 0\u00b728 \u00b5m) and mZN-stained (4\u00b726 \u00b1 0\u00b729 \u00b5m) faecal smears revealed non-significant (0\u00b716 NS) variation in the size.

Both the faecal antigen-ELISA and PCR showed an improved 35% prevalence of Cryptosporidium in diarrhoeic calves.

The maximal prevalence of Cryptosporidium was recoded in the 2-week-old diarrhoeic bovine calves. Similar prevalence of cryptosporidial infection in neonatal diarrhoeic calves with a gradual reduction with age has been reported previously from various regions of India [5, 21, 22, 35] and across the globe [27, [36] [37] [38] [39] . In the present study, all calves positive by faecal ELISA were also positive for the Cryptosporidium by PCR, except one. The sensitivity of ELISA and mZN staining with respect to PCR was 97\u00b714% and 72\u00b772%, respectively (Table 4 ). Comparable results regarding sensitivity between ELISA and PCR, matching those of ours, were previously recorded by other workers [25, 40] irrespective of the variations in the type of reagents and kits used. Settawy and Fathy [41] observed high detection rate by PCR (24\u00b74%) and low by microscopy (18\u00b76%), while it was 20\u00b79% by ELISA. Their data showing higher sensitivity of PCR compared with ELISA are contradictory to our results showing equivalent positivity. In the differentiation of the aetiology of the diarrhoea in neonatal calves, PCR is being increasingly employed for the detection of Cryptosporidium during the last two decades mainly because of its accuracy, specificity and sensitivity and it has made significant contributions in understanding the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium infection [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Moreover PCR has added advantages such as ease of use, ability to analyse large numbers of samples simultaneously, relatively low cost and ability to speciate (eliminating false positives and cross-reactions of antibodies to non-pathogenic species) [45] . Though nested PCR involving a second round of amplifications has been applied to Cryptosporidium to increase specificity and sensitivity [35, 47, 48] , yet it has not been generally recommended for use in diagnostic laboratories owing to a major risk of contamination with PCR products [45, 49] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 446, "end": 449, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 450, "end": 453, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 454, "end": 457, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 458, "end": 461, "text": "35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 483, "end": 487, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 488, "end": 492, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 493, "end": 497, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 498, "end": 502, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 503, "end": 507, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 871, "end": 875, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 876, "end": 879, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 968, "end": 972, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1552, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1553, "end": 1557, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1562, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1563, "end": 1567, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1568, "end": 1572, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1828, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1972, "text": "[35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1976, "text": "47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1980, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2117, "end": 2121, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2125, "text": "49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 173, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 729, "end": 737, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Detection of Cryptosporidium by conventional and immunological and molecular methods"}, {"text": "The progression of diarrhoea with multifactorial aetiology is rapid.

Moreover, the age-wise faecal prevalence of Cryptosporidium as a single agent and combination aetiologies with it, showed a decreasing and increasing trend (\u03c7 2 13\u00b728, P < 0\u00b701), respectively (Table 5 ). This indicates that initial primary infection with Cryptosporidium led to significant enterocytic damage favouring flare up of other secondary infections with the passage of time. In addition, the findings of severe intestinal epithelial damage (Fig. 3) , lymphoid depletion in mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 4) and demonstration of Cryptosporidium along with coccidiosis (eimeriosis) (Fig. 5) were amply augmented by histopathology of the representative tissue samples collected from calf mortality during the outbreaks. Histopathology is considered as a gold standard for demonstrating the intestinal involvement and cryptosporidia in one go in the animals dying of diarrhoeal disease [6] . Furthermore, the haematobiochemical findings of significant neutrophilic leucocytosis, lymphopaenia and anaemia along with significant increase in serum albumin and blood urea nitrogen with corresponding significant decrease in total globulins hinted at secondary suppurative infection, dehydration and immunosuppression, respectively, as have been reported by the authors earlier [52, 53] . Contrary to our findings, de la Fuente et al. [27] reported a significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections. In fact, the epidemiological studies have proven that diarrhoea is more severe in mixed infection(s), especially in immunocompromised individuals [54] . In this study, the Cryptosporidium-associated pathogens responsible for bovine calf scour outbreaks and mortality were C. perfringens 45\u00b771% (16/25), followed by Salmonella spp 40\u00b70% (10/25), rotavirus 36\u00b70% (9/25), coronavirus 16\u00b70% (4/25), E. coli 12\u00b70% (3/25) and Eimeria spp. 4\u00b70% (1/4), respectively, which fell nearly in line with that for C. perfringens (54\u00b70%) and in contrast to rotavirus (87%), coronavirus (11\u00b71%), E. coli (27\u00b78%) and Salmonella spp. - (1\u00b78%) in central Spain [55] .
