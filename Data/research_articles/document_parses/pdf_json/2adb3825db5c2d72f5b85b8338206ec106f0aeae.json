All residents must agree with the new task, so implementation of any changes should be preceded by meetings that involve residents and other key stakeholders in the institution in order to reach an agreement through dialogue and negotiation. CRs are leaders, ergo they must lead the resident workforce to a common goal. This should involve cooperation between the CRs and the resident workforce, who should display teamwork in finding solutions that are aimed at achieving a shared goal. The leadership of the CRs should not be seen as a position of authority, but instead as a tool for the resident workforce to continually improve. Through this, the well-being of the \"down work\" of the CRs leads to the fulfillment of their \"up work\". Residents should not be made to feel that institution directors and CRs impose changes on residents in the COVID-19 era. Unprecedented times should not lead to changes that are negatively viewed by residents, since the shared goal of resident well-being and patient safety still remains.",
