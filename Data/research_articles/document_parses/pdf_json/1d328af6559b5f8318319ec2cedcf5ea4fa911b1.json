The employed approach utilizes a synthetic population of Saint Petersburg and a statistical model for arterial hypertension prevalence. The number of ACS-related emergency services calls in an area is matched with the population density and the prospected number of individuals with arterial hypertension, which makes it possible to find locations with excessive ACS incidence. Three categories of locations, depending on the joint distribution of the above-mentioned indicators, are proposed as a result of data analysis. The method is implemented in Python programming language, the visualization is made using QGIS open software. The proposed method can be used to assess the prevalence of certain health conditions in the population and to match them with the corresponding severe health outcomes.",

This condition is treatable if diagnosed quickly, but since the fast diagnostics is not always possible, the death toll of ACS in the world population is dramatic [6] . The modeling approach for forecasting the distribution of ACS cases would allow the healthcare specialists to be better prepared for the ACS cases, both in emergency services and in stationary healthcare facilities [3] . One of the simple forecasting methods is related to the application of statistical analysis to the retrospective EMS calls data associated with acute heart conditions. However, if the corresponding time series data set is not long, the accurate prediction is impossible without using additional data related to the possible prerequisites for acute coronary syndrome calls, such as health conditions that increase the risk of ACS.",

Arterial hypertension is one of the main factors leading to atherogenesis and the development of vulnerable plaques, which in turn might be responsible for the development of acute coronary syndromes [10] . Thus, we might assume that the urban area populated predominantly by individuals with AH might demonstrate higher rates of ACS. Based on that assumption, it might be possible to use spatially explicit AH data as an additional predictor of prospective ACS cases. Unfortunately, the data on AH prevalence with the geographical matching are rarely found, and for Russian settings, they are virtually non-existent. Nevertheless, they could be generated synthetically, which adds uncertainty to the analysis but, on the other hand, makes possible the analysis itself.",

Using Saint Petersburg as a case study, we address the following question: may the synthesized AH data combined with EMS calls dataset provide additional information connected with ACS distribution in the population, compared to absolute data and relative data on EMS calls alone? The EMS data we used in the research contain 5125 ACS-related EMS calls registered in Saint Petersburg from January to November 2015 [7] . The backof-the-envelope analysis of the time series corresponding to daily number of calls ( Fig. 1 ) and the weekly EMS calls distribution (Fig. 2 ) did not reveal any statistically significant patterns connected with distribution of calls over time, although it is clear that the number of EMS calls has a decline in the weekends. Thus, there is no straightforward prediction method to forecast fluctuations of the cumulative number of daily EMS calls connected with ACS.",

Each individual receives two additional characteristics [9] : -The AH risk (the probability of having arterial hypertension).

We use the ratio r 1 to understand which cells have large differences in the orders of magnitude compared to other cells.

Most of these locations happen to be near the places connected with tourism and entertainment (1 -Gazprom Arena football stadium, 2 -Peterhof historical park) or industrial facilities (3 -bus park, trolleybus park, train depot; 4 -Izhora factory, Kolpino bus park). Location 5 corresponds to Pulkovo airport, a major transport hub (it is marked by only two blue points though). Location 6 is the one which cannot be easily connected with excessive EMS calls-it is situated in a small suburb with plenty of housing. The possible interpretation of why it demonstrates high r 1 is the discrepancy between the actual number of dwellers for 2015 (a year for EMS calls data) compared to the 2010 information (a year for populational data). This zone was a rapidly developing construction site and subsequently witnessed a fast increase in the number of dwellers. Location 7 is also an expectational one -it is the only one which is marked by three green points (high r 2 ). Additionally, this zone was not marked by high r 1 , although it is easily interpreted as yet another industrial district (Lenpoligraphmash printing factory). Increasing the number of points in a distribution to 100 does not change significantly the results: isolated areas with meaningful interpretation are mostly marked by the blue points, except Lenpoligraphmash at location 7.",

In Fig. 8 , where r 1 and r 2 values are plotted against a heatmap of EMS call numbers, we see that there are two types of peak concentrations of EMS calls (bright red color). Ones are not marked with green dots (the r 2 values are not high) and thus might be explained by high concentration of dwellers in general. Others, marked with green dots, show the locations with high number of EMS calls relative to population. In case the locations does not demonstrate high r 1 values (no blue dots in the same place), they might correspond to the category of neighborhoods with ACS risk factors not associated with arterial hypertension (to be more precise, not associated with the old age of dwellers, since it is the main parameter of the statistical model for AH prevalence used in this study).",

Ascribing EMS calls to one or another property of the area based on such a small number of observations is definitely premature, and thus our interpretations given earlier in the text should be continuously tested using the new data on EMS calls. Despite the fact that we cannot draw any definite and final conclusions, in the author's opinion, the study successfully introduces the application of the concept of using synthesized data for health conditions of unknown prevalence (arterial hypertension) to categorize spatial distribution of their acute repercussions (acute coronary syndrome). As it was demonstrated by the authors before [2] , the same approach can be successfully used in case of opioid drug usage, and we expect to broaden the scope of its application by applying it in other domains.",

We want to explore the possibility of using a yet another indicator which will take into account the absolute number of dwellers in the neighborhood and will have a meaningful interpretation. -We have access to a number of health records of the people hospitalized with ACS in a human-readable format, which contains information about their AH status. Using natural language processing tools, we plan to obtain a digital version of this data set and consequently to assess numerically the connection between AH and ACS cases in Saint Petersburg.
