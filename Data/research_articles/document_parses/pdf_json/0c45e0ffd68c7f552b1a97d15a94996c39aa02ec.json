A special consideration was given to the variety of contents, forms and writing styles typical for media texts. For example, we required a coding scheme that would fit laconic or problem-driven short reports (too short for full-fledged Labovian narrative style), as well as complicated texts with multiple story-lines moving from one story to another. We addressed this challenge by focusing on two out of Labovs six elementscomplicating action and resolution. Providing answers to the potential question And then what happened? (Labov, 2013) , we consider these two elements to be the most fundamental and relevant for news analysis. There are several reasons for our focus on these particular elements: first, it goes in line with the understanding that worth-telling stories usually consist of protagonists facing and resolving problematic experiences (Eggins and Slade, 2005) ; from a macro-level perspective, this can be useful to capture or characterize the plot type of stories (Shenhav, 2015) . Moreover, these elements resonate with what is considered by Entman (2004) to be the most important Framing Functions -problem definition and remedy. Our focus can also open up opportunities for further exploration of other important narrative elements in media stories, such as identifying villainous protagonists who are expected to be strongly associated with the complication of the story, and who are expected to be instrumental to a successful resolution (Shenhav, 2015) . In order to adapt the original complicating action and resolution categories to news media content, we designed our annotation scheme as follows. Complicating action -hence, Complication -was defined in our narrative scheme as an event, or series of events, that point at problems or tensions. Resolution refers to the way the story is resolved or to the release of the tension. An improvement from -or a manner of -coping with an existing or hypothetical situation was also counted as a resolution. We did that to follow the lack of a closure which is typical for many social stories (Shenhav, 2015) and the often tentative or speculative notion of future resolutions in news stories (Thornborrow and Fitzgerald, 2004) . We have therefore included in this category any temporary or partial resolutions. The transitional characteristic of the resolution brought us to subdivide this category into yet another derivative category defined as Success. Unlike the transitional aspect of the resolution, which refers, implicitly or explicitly, to a prior situation, this category was designed to capture any description or indication of an achievement or a good and positive state.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 660, "text": "(Labov, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 973, "end": 997, "text": "(Eggins and Slade, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1118, "text": "(Shenhav, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1597, "text": "(Shenhav, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2200, "text": "(Shenhav, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2319, "text": "(Thornborrow and Fitzgerald, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adaptation"}, {"text": "Here we describe the process of constructing CompRes, our dataset of news articles annotated with narrative structures.

The improvement is evident for every one of the narrative categories, but is particularly substantial for the Success category -an F 1 score of 0.56 compared to 0.15, constituting an increase of 373%. One plausible explanation we can offer has to do with the nature of our Success category; while the Complication and Resolution categories seem to be constrained by sets of generic terminologies, the definition of Success is more content-oriented, and thus highly sensitive to specific contexts. For example, linguistically speaking, the definition of the success of an athlete in never being tested positive for a banned substance (see sentence #14 in Table 5 ) is very different from the definition of success in the cultural context of the art scene of a city (sentence #10 in Table 5 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 30, "end": 37, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF8"}, {"start": 883, "end": 890, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1017, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF7"}], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Generally, the performance for each category appears to reflect the proportion of instances belonging to each category (see Table 1 ).

However, in the deep models this behavior seems to be less extreme; in the augmented RoBERTa model, the F 1 score for the Success category is higher by 0.05 compared to the Resolution category, despite being less frequent in the dataset. We also observe that the Success category consistently exhibit notably higher precision than recall, across all models, possibly due to the smaller number of samples encountered by the classifier during training.

A related interesting option is to add completely new narrative elements specifically designed for informational texts and news articles, such as actor-based elements identifying entities which are related to one or more of the currently defined narrative categories; for instance, as mentioned in 2.2, we may add indications for villainous protagonists, strongly associated with complications in the story and are expected to be instrumental to a successful resolution.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 297, "text": "(Labov, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Another direction which we would like to explore includes enriching the scheme with clauselevel annotation of the different narrative elements, effectively converting the task from multilabel classification to a sequence prediction one -detecting the boundaries of the different narrative elements in the sentence. Alternatively, we could introduce additional layers of information which will encode more global narrative structures in the text, such as inter-sentence references between narratively-related elements (e.g., a Resolution referencing its inducing Complication), or even between narrativelyrelated articles (e.g., different accounts of the same story).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Survey article: Inter-coder agreement for computational linguistics", "authors": [{"first": "Ron", "middle": [], "last": "Artstein", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Massimo", "middle": [], "last": "Poesio", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Computational Linguistics", "volume": "34", "issn": "4", "pages": "555--596", "other_ids": {"DOI": ["10.1162/coli.07-034-R2"]}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Annotating content zones in news articles.
