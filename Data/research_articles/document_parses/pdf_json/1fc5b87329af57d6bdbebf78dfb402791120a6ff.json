The outbreak galvanized global action around strengthening infectious disease prevention, detection and response capabilities. We examined the nascent landscape of international programmes, initiatives and institutions established in the aftermath of the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak with the aim of assessing their progress to date to illustrate the current state of the world's global health security architecture. We also compare these efforts with shortcomings in epidemic management documented during the epidemic, and underscore remaining gaps in regional and global epidemic response capabilities that might benefit from additional programmatic and financial support. Notably, most of the post-Ebola initiatives considered in this analysis have yet to meet their financial goals. Operational progress has also been limited, revealing a need for continued investments to improve outbreak surveillance and detection capabilities specifically. Furthermore, our review highlighted the dominance of the USA and Europe in leading and financing efforts to coordinate long-term recovery efforts in West Africa, strengthen health systems across the continent, and enhance global preparedness for future epidemics, raising important questions about ownership of global health security efforts in non-Western regions of the world. Finally, the lack of transparency and available data on these initiatives' activities and budgets also complicate efforts to project their impacts on the global health security landscape.",

It was not until 17 months later, in March of 2016, that the PHEIC designation was lifted, after 28 616 cases and 11 310 deaths were recorded in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia (World Health Organization, 2016d) .",

However, given growing membership in the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and GHSA's emphasis on monitoring and evaluating progress across its 11 focus areas (i.e. action packages), it remains imperative that these still-nascent, post-Ebola health security initiatives align with and supplement existing efforts to strengthen global health security. Ultimately, monitoring the emergence and progress of these new initiatives will help ensure that vulnerable countries can access resources to develop and sustain the capacities required to counter catastrophic epidemics and achieve positive health outcomes during health crises.",

We limited our search to English-language documents describing multilateral initiatives that are international in scope, were established directly in response to the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic, and focused on improving infectious disease outbreak prevention, detection and response capacities and capabilities. National after-action reports, reports describing country-level post-Ebola initiatives, and documents describing subnational Ebola response and recovery efforts were excluded.

CEPI describes itself as an end-to-end player in the vaccine development cycle (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, 2016). It plans to fund the development and licensure of vaccines specifically (the stage ranging from late preclinical studies to safety and proof of concept), but aims to also facilitate work from discovery to research, manufacturing and stockpiling. CEPI has the backing of several industry representatives, such as Merck and GlaxoSmithKline, which both hold seats on CEPI's board. The recommended initial diseases of focus are MERS, Lassa and Nipah, each of which is designated as WHO priority pathogens and has a vaccine candidate in development (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, 2016). Although CEPI has accepted over $540 M in funding (as of July 2017) from the governments of Norway, Germany, Japan, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, the organization is short of its $1B funding goal (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, 2017c). CEPI has also faced a long runway from when the idea for international collaboration around adaptive clinical trial design, common protocols for randomized clinical trials, and product development and advanced manufacturing was first raised during the Ebola epidemic in September 2015 (Borio et al., 2015) .

West Africa was selected for this initiative due to its increased susceptibility to infectious disease outbreaks as demonstrated by the Ebola outbreak. Guinea, Sierra Leone and Senegal are expected to receive the first multi-million instalments; however, there are plans to eventually expand to all 15 countries in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) with an eye towards developing an interconnected, regional surveillance network. In addition to strengthening capacity for disease surveillance, REDISSE also includes a response component to improve national response capabilities in the event of an emergency.

In collaboration with WHO, the World Bank has instituted a two-prong Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF). The primary mechanism is pandemic insurance, which has been operational as of July 2017 and which covers low income client countries (i.e. those eligible to borrow from the IDA). The insurance can be paid out for outbreaks of six viruses evaluated by the World Bank as most likely to cause a pandemic: orthomyxovirus (e.g. H1N1 and other influenza virus A subtypes), coronavirus (e.g. SARS, MERS), filovirus (e.g. Ebola, Marburg), Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever or Lassa fever.",

Germany has contributed 50 million euros to this 'cash window', which is expected to open in 2018 (The World Bank, 2017b). The World Bank hopes that the PEF will create a new market for pandemic insurance, in which preparedness is incentivized and risks are mitigated. Early indicators suggest that the PEF may indeed spark such a market-the initial bond offerings were oversubscribed by 200% (The World Bank, 2017b).

However, this limitation also reflects a real-world bias, as most of the major post-Ebola health security efforts identified in this study are being led and financed predominantly by Western and high-income countries. Additionally, our review was also restricted to documents made available in the public domain. As a result, we did not have access to financial records, internal memoranda and reports, or other non-public materials that might account for some of the publicly documented funding, workforce, technical and administrative gaps identified in this review Our ultimate goal is to determine whether the measures enacted by the global community in the wake of the Ebola epidemic result in sustainable advances in public health preparedness and response with respect to catastrophic infectious disease events. The findings from this investigation comprise an initial step in monitoring and evaluating progress towards this goal. As the initiatives identified in our investigation mature, a future analysis of their impacts on global health security might benefit from additional, complementary modes of data collection, such as interviews with public health leaders in LMIC and systematic reviews of scholarly literature covering these initiatives. As additional countries undergo the Joint External Evaluation process, the results of their assessments might also provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of global health security-strengthening initiatives.
