[7] After screening acollection of ethynyl nucleosides including 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), [8] (2'S)-2-deoxy-2'-fluoro-5-ethynyluridine (Fara-EdU), [9] 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxycytidine (EdC), [10] and 7deaza-7-ethynyl-2'-deoxyadenosine (EdA), [11] we discovered that ethynyl-modified viral genomes could be produced without negatively impacting viral infectivity or egress. [7] All of these nucleosides,h owever,w ere also incorporated into cellular genomes. [8] [9] [10] [11] In samples in which the cells and viruses were simultaneously replicating,v iral DNAc ould not be detected over the large background of cellular DNA. [7] Herein, we report astrategy for pathogen-selective labeling that utilizes the relaxed fidelity of pathogen-encoded enzymes. [6] Then ew gemcitabine metabolite analogue 2'deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-ethynyluridine (dF-EdU) is selectively metabolized in HSV-1 infected cells owing to the expression of av iral thymidine kinase (TK). [12] Subsequent treatment with Cu I and an azide-conjugated fluorophore stains cells harboring an HSV-1 infection but not uninfected cells.I n addition to the large number of viruses that encode nucleoside kinases, [13a] this general approach should be applicable to viruses that encode error-prone polymerases (HIV,influenza virus,r hinovirus,p oliovirus,c oronavirus,e tc.), [13b,c] as well as parasitic mycoplasma that encode unique purine salvage enzymes. [13d] Thec hemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine (dFdC, 1)i s deaminated in vivo [14] to give 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine (dFdU, 2;S cheme 1). Both dFdC and dFdU are phosphorylated and incorporated into nucleic acids by endogenous human enzymes. [15] dFdU is significantly less toxic than dFdC [16] and was therefore selected for further development as ametabolic label. dFdU derivatives containing substituents at the 5-position, such as 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-bromouridine (BrdFdU), are nontoxic to mammalian cell cultures but they inhibit herpes virus replication. [17] These results suggest the presence of BrdFdU-selective metabolism by one or more ",

[21] According to this model, the terminal ethynyl carbon of dF-EdU is only 2.67 f rom the Cb of Thr163, ap osition known to mediate steric control over substrate specificity. [22] This potential steric clash is insufficient for the rejection of dF-EdU because 5ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) is phosphorylated by hTK ( Figure S3 ). Likewise,2 ' -deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine (dFdU, Figure 1 ) is also as ubstrate for hTK. [15, 16] Thec ombined interplay of steric constraints from both the 5-ethnyl group and the 2'-fluorine atoms is therefore responsible for the inability of hTK to phosphorylate dF-EdU.C onsistent with this conclusion, the superimposition model places the (2'R) fluorine atom of dF-EdU 2.20-2.32 f rom Va l174/Ile 175, and its terminal ethynyl carbon atom 2.67 f rom Thr163 (Figure 2b) .",
