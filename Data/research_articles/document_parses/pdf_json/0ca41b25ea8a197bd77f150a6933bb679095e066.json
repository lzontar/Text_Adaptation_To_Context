One of the main solutions proposed for this information overload problem are recommender systems, which provide personalized results. Most existing social recommendation approaches consider relation information to improve recommendation performance in the static context. However, relations are likely to evolve over time in the dynamic network. Therefore, temporal information is an essential ingredient to making social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation model based on evolving relation network, named SoERec. The learned evolving relation network is a heterogeneous information network, where the strength of relation between users is a sum of the influence of all historical events.

User-generated content such as text, images, and videos has been posted by users on these platforms. Social users is suffering from information overload. Fortunately, recommender systems provide a useful tool, which not only help users to select the relevant part of online information, but also discovery user preference and promote popular item, etc. Among existing techniques, collaborative filtering (CF) is a representative model, which attempt to utilize the available user-item rating data to make predictions about the users preferences. These approaches can be divided into two groups [1] : memory-based and model-based. Memory-based approaches [2, 8, 16] make predictions based on the similarities between users or items, while model-based approaches [3, 9] design a prediction model from rating data by using machine learning. Both memory-based and model-based CF approaches have two challenges: data sparsity and cold start, which greatly reduce their performance. In particular, matrix factorization based models [13, 19] have gained popularity in recent years due to their relatively high accuracy and personalized advice. Existing research works have contributed improvements in social recommendation tasks. However, these approaches only consider static social contextual information. In the real world, knowledge is often time-labeled and will change significantly over time. Figure 1 shows the entire social contextual information over time which can be derived from links on social networks. User Jack post message m 1 , which mention users Tom and Eric, at time point t 1 . Subsequently, user Jack post message m 2 , which mention user Eric again, at time point t 3 . Meanwhile, message m 2 is retweeted by user Ellen at time point t 5 . We observe that new social action is often influenced by historical related behaviors. In addition, historical behaviors have an impact on current action over time, and the impact strength decreases with time. On the other hand, we notice that the evolving relation network is very sparse, which greatly reduce the recommendation performance.

Secondly, trust-based algorithms (TrustMF, SocialMF and RSTE) consistently perform better than non-trust based benchmarks (SocRec, PMF). It is because trust-based algorithms can fully exploit the network structure, which tackles the incomplete, sparse and noisy problem.
