We observe that China, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong, and Switzerland have flattened their infection curves. For these nations, the total number of infected individuals (I(t)) exhibits a succession of exponential growth and power-law growth (t 2 , t, \u221a t in sequence) before flattening of the curve. USA, India, and Sri Lanka have reached up to the linear growth (I(t) \u223c t), but they are yet to flatten their curves. Russia and Singapore are still in the exponential growth regime. Such features of I(t) curves could be used for understanding and forecast of the epidemic evolution. Besides these detailed analysis, we compare the predictions of an extended SEIR model and a delay differential equation-based model with the reported infection data, and observed a general agreement between them. * soumyade@iitk.ac.in \u2020 shayak.2015@iitkalumni.org \u2021 aliasad@iitk.ac.in \u00a7 shabhatt@iitk.ac.in \u00b6",

Therefore, cure as well as understanding of the pandemic are extremely crucial. In the present paper, we analyze the publicly-available national COVID-19 infection data [1] up to 20th April, 2020. We observe that the COVID-19 infection curves for many nations exhibit power-law growth after an exponential growth.

L\u00f3pez and Rodo [7] formulated an extended version of this model to analyse the spread of the pandemic in Spain and Italy. Hellewell et al. [8] studied the effects of isolation on controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. Chinazzi et al. [9] analyzed the effects of travel restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 in China and in the world using the global metapopulation disease transmission model. Mandal et al. [10] constructed model for devising intervention strategies in India. Using an age-structured SIR model, Singh and Adhikari [11] studied the impact of social distancing on the COVID-19 epidemic in India. Shayak et al. [12] and Shayak and Rand [13] have constructed delay differential equation (DDE) model for the spread of COVID-19; these models takes into account the pre-symptomatic period and the effects of testing delays. They have also constructed a model to predict the end of the epidemic.",

By April 7, China and South Korea had flattened the I(t) curves, but other nations were either in the exponential regime or in power-law regime. However, by April 20, more nations are close to the flattening of the curve. Besides the above results, Prakash et al. [24] reported a linear growth of I(t) after early exponential growth. Sch\u00fcttler et al. [25] analyzed the daily death counts for various nations and observed that their probability distributions appear to follow Gauss profile. They argue that the Gauss model could be useful for the predictions of the duration and extent of death cases. Marsland and Mehta [18] observed that the error function provides best fit to the total count, I(t); this observation follows from Sch\u00fcttler et al. [25] 's analysis.",

In the first part [ Fig. 2(a) ], we illustrate cases that belong mostly to China. After approximately thirty days of outbreak (around February 20), I(t) for China starts to saturate. In Fig. 2(b) , we exhibit the\u012a(t) curve after t = 41 (March 02) when China had achieved flattening of the curve. In Fig. 2(b) , t = t \u2212 40 and\u012a(t) = I(t) \u2212 I(t 0 ) = I(t) \u2212 88000 due to the coordinate shifts.

(9) (10) are chosen in such a way that the recovery rate saturates and the death rate vanishes with time. Note that the cumulative number of reported infected cases (denoted by I(t) in Sec. II) is the sum of Q(t), R(t), and D(t). For further details, refer to Peng et al. [6] and L\u00f3pez and Rodo [7] . We compare the model predictions [Eqs. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) ] with the available data [1] for USA, Italy, Spain and Japan. For Spain and Japan, t = 0 is taken to be the starting date shown in Table I . For USA and Italy, t = 0 corresponds to 29th and 24th February respectively. The end date for all the four countries is 20th April. The initial values of Q, R, and D are taken to be the total active cases, recovered cases and deaths respectively at t = 0 for each country. The number of initial insusceptible cases (P (t = 0)) is assumed to be zero. We adjust the parameters {\u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4, {\u03bb 0 , \u03bb 1 }, {\u03ba 0 , \u03ba 1 }}, E(t = 0) and I(t = 0) such that the relative error between the model and actual data is minimized. Note that the initial condition satisfies the relation (11) where N is the total population of the country. In Fig. 4 , we present the best-fit curves from the SEIR model along with the actual real-time data. Clearly, this model fits well with the data for Italy and Spain. In Table IV we list the numerical values of the best-fit parameters and the relative errors between the predictions and data. Note that for Spain and Italy, L\u00f3pez and Rodo [7] considered natural birth and death rates in their model and obtained fits for Q, R and D seperately. In contrast, we stick to the fundamental assumption regarding natural birth and death rates of the basic SEIR model [32] and obtain the fits for Q(t) + R(t) + D(t) till April 20.",

For example, Coronavirus has a presymptomatic period, i.e., a period during which people are transmissible but do not show symptoms. There are also a significant number of asymptomatic carriers who do not manifest symptoms during the entire infection period. Finally, due to scarcity of testing equipment, an issue which was even more pronounced during the early phases of the outbreak, it sometimes takes many days for the test results to arrive. These features cannot be accounted for by a real-time model properly and need a delayed differential equation model. Shayak et al. [12] and Shayak and Rand [13] have formulated dynamic models for COVID-19 based on delay differential equations (DDE). The first model aims to describe community transmission of the disease, while the second one describes a new route to the end of the pandemic through a combination of social distancing, sanitization, contact tracing and preventive testing. We shall briefly describe the two models below.",

Unlike an ordinary differential equation which needs only an initial value, a DDE needs an initial function, with the duration of this function being the longest delay involved in the equation. In (12) this maximum delay is 15 days. Hence we need to seed (12) with initial conditions over a 15-day period. During this seeding period, we assume constant value of x, zero value of z, and linear growths in z and w. We have obtained these growth rates from a fit to the subsequent data. Because of the nature of the initial conditions, a comparison between model and reality in the first 15 days is meaningless. During the next 15 days also, we find considerable error on account of the initial condition, and only after that do these errors die out and the model converges to the actual case trajectories.",
