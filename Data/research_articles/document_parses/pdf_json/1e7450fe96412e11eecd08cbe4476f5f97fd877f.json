Despite active control measures taken by the Chinese government, the number of infected patients is still increasing day by day. At present, the changing trend of the epidemic is attracting the attention of everyone. Based on data from 21 January to 20 February 2020, six rolling grey Verhulst models were built using 7-, 8-and 9-day data sequences to predict the daily growth trend of the number of patients confirmed with COVID-19 infection in China. The results show that these six models consistently predict the S-shaped change characteristics of the cumulative number of confirmed patients, and the daily growth decreased day by day after 4 February. The predicted results obtained by different models are very approximate, with very high prediction accuracy. In the training stage, the maximum and minimum mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 4.74% and 1.80%, respectively; in the testing stage, the maximum and minimum MAPEs are 4.72% and 1.65%, respectively. This indicates that the predicted results show high robustness. If the number of clinically diagnosed cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, where COVID-19 was first detected, is not counted from 12 February, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China will reach a maximum of 60,364-61,327 during 17-22 March; otherwise, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China will be 78,817-79,780.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "An epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in early 2020, and spread rapidly in China and across the world, causing tens of thousands of people to be infected with the virus. On 21 January, the prevention and control of the epidemic sprouted at the national level, and many provinces in China launched the first-level emergency response of epidemic prevention. By 30 January, more than 7000 COVID-19 infection cases had been confirmed in China and more than 50 cases had been confirmed in countries and regions outside China, so the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). According to the latest data (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, it can be seen from Figure 1 that the number of confirmed cases increases in an S-shaped trend. Although the cumulative number is rising, the number of newly confirmed cases reached an inflection point, reaching the peak on 4 February and then gradually decreasing. The number of newly confirmed cases rose excessively on 27 January due to the increase in the number of institutions with the capacity of pneumonia detection. Figure 2 demonstrates that the number of suspected cases rose until 8 February and then decreased, while the number of deaths slowly increased and reached 2239 in total on 20 February. Moreover, the number of cured patients significantly increased and reached 18 ,278 on the same day. On 11 February, the new coronavirus disease was officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the virus strain as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The accurate prediction of the number of patients infected with COVID-19 in China is undoubtedly of great significance for implementing prevention and control measures and carrying out economic and social activities. Considering the limited sample size since the outbreak of the epidemic and that a large sample size is needed to use the classical statistical prediction method, the present research used the grey system theory, which can be modeled with only four data points [1, 2] . On this basis, a rolling grey Verhulst model and its derived models were established to predict the change trend of the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in China.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1571, "end": 1573, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2335, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2338, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 906, "end": 914, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1319, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Since the outbreak of the epidemic of COVID-19, many scientists in the world have studied the causes and mechanisms of spread of the virus, along with relevant treatment programs.

However, the above prediction models have some flaws. For example, the assumptions of the infectious disease model are strong, assuming that there is no super communicator, and are easily affected by factors such as geography; economic models or intelligent algorithms have strict requirements on data, requiring a large amount of data to be trained and tested to obtain relatively accurate prediction results. In response to such new viruses, with low data availability and incomplete cognition, the above models may not be applicable.

[25] predicted all factors of disability in middle-aged and old people and the probability of specific injuries through the grey GM(1,1) model and found that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are still the main threats to health for the elderly. In order to accurately predict the development of human echinococcosis in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, Zhang et al. [26] made short-term predictions using three models, i.e., a traditional GM(1,1) model, a grey-periodic extensional combinatorial model (PECGM(1,1)) and a flamelet-generated manifold (FGM(1,1)) model optimized by Fourier series. In the meanwhile, based on the transmission mechanism of echinococcosis, they established a prediction model for dynamic epidemics that can effectively predict the future development trend of epidemics. The traditional GM(1,1) model is mainly applicable to the sequences with strong exponential laws and can only describe the monotonic change process. However, the grey Verhulst model has strong prediction capability for the non-monotonic swinging developmental sequences or the saturated S-shaped sequences due to the first-order accumulated generating operation (AGO-1) of the original data.

In order to improve the accurate prediction of short-term traffic speed and travel time, Bezuglov and Comert [33] utilized the GM(1,1) model, the GM(1,1) model modified by Fourier error and the grey Verhulst model modified by Fourier error for prediction. The results demonstrate that the grey Verhulst model modified by Fourier error can better process sudden changes in the parameters of a traffic system sequence. Wang and Li [34] constructed a non-equal-interval grey Verhulst model and its derived model and optimized parameters of the models by using particle swarm optimization. On this basis, they verified the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) of carbon dioxide emission in China by discussing the relationship between carbon dioxide emission and economic growth using a grey model. By building a grey Verhulst model, Wu et al. [35] predicted comprehensive air quality indexes in the Chinese cities of Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, and the results show that the input of the government can promote improvement of air quality to some extent. Zhang et al. [36] combined the Verhulst model with the BP neural network to gain complementary advantages and improve prediction accuracy and stability. By utilizing the grey Verhulst model, Wang et al. [37] predicted the state of the iron and steel industry in 2025 based on the relationship between carbon emission of the industry and economic growth from 2001 to 2016; they also put forward relevant policy implications. In order to increase the predictive ability of the initial model, the model is changed appropriately to better adapt to the current needs. By introducing a new non-homogeneous exponential function, Zeng et al. [38] constructed a grey N-Verhulst model that overcame the defects of parameter dislocation and unreasonable initial value selection of the traditional Verhulst model. In addition, some scholars have built grey models based on a rolling mechanism to explore the hidden useful information of the original data sequence and improve the modeling accuracy. Akay and Atak [39] proposed a grey prediction model based on a rolling mechanism to predict the total and industrial power consumption in Turkey. The results demonstrate that the grey model based on a rolling mechanism shows greatly improved prediction accuracy.

Under strict anti-epizootic measures in China, it is assumed that COVID-19 cannot spread indefinitely in China and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will not increase indefinitely and will eventually converge to the corresponding saturation value. Therefore, the grey Verhulst model is suitable for modeling growth and changes in the number of virus infection cases, especially for prediction of the final value and inflection point of the number of confirmed cases.

By observing prediction performance of the six models in the testing set, it can be seen that their prediction accuracies are all less than 10%, suggesting that the models can accurately predict changes of the number of confirmed cases in the future. As demonstrated in Table 4 , in the testing set, prediction accuracy of the grey Verhulst model with the rolling sequence length of 7 is higher than that of its derived model; the grey Verhulst model and its derived model have MAPE values of 3.30% and 3.83%, respectively.
