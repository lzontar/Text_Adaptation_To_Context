This strain was isolated from a calf diarrhea in Japan, and the VP6 gene was 1356 nucleotides (nt) long (DDBJ accession no. AB040055). The amplified VP6 gene was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The resulting clone, pGEM-T/VP6, was digested with SmaI and SacI and subcloned into the plant expression vectors pBI121 (Clontech) to yield pBIVP6, and pBE2113 [16] to yield pBEVP6. The pBI121 is a binary vector for expression in plants using the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter to drive transcription and the nopaline synthase terminator. The pBE2113 has the same promoter and terminator as the pBI121 but carries translational enhancers that are two tandem repeats of the 5 -upstream sequence of CaMV 35S promoter, and the 5 -untranslated sequence of tobacco mosaic virus. Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 was transformed with pBIVP6 or pBEVP6 and used for potato plants (Solanum tuberosum cv. Mayqueen) transformation as described previously [9] . The VP6 gene was also cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (PharMingen). Cotransfection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells with the recombinant pVL1392 and the Baculogold linearized baculovirus DNA (PharMingen) was performed by the Lipofectin (Gibco BRL) method in accordance with the manufacture's instructions.",

ELISA plates (Maxisorp; Nunc) were coated with hyperimmune or preimmune gnotobiotic pig anti-GAR (Lincoln strain) serum and incubated overnight at 4 \u2022 C. The plates were blocked with 5% BLOTTO [5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20] at room temperature for 1 h. Potato leaf or tuber extracts obtained by homogenisation in PBS (pH 7.4) plus 50 mM sodium ascorbate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl and 0.2% Triton X-100 (5 ml/g fresh wt in leaves and 1 ml/g fresh wt in tubers) were added to the plates and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h. Hyperimmune rabbit anti-GAR (22R) serum and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit IgG (KPL) were added in subsequent steps. ABTS [2,2azino-bis (3-ethyl-benthizoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt] was added each well as substrate. The plates were developed at room temperature for 30 min and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5% sodium lauryl sulfate. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 405 nm. Net optical density (OD) was calculated as the OD from hyperimmune antiserum-coated wells minus the OD from preimmune serum-coated wells. A sample was considered GAR antigens positive if a net OD had greater than 0.1. Each ELISA plate included positive controls containing 3 to 200 ng of baculovirus-expressed VP6. The level of baculovirus-expressed VP6 was determined by comparing the band intensity of baculovirus-expressed VP6 with that of known concentration of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) following SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and coomassie blue staining. The amount of VP6 in the medium of Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus recombinant 120 h postinfection was 100 \u00b5g/ml, which was similar to that reported previously [6] . The level of VP6 expressed in potato plants was determined by comparison of net ODs in ELISA between potato samples and the baculovirus-expressed VP6. The concentration of total soluble protein of potato samples was determined with the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).",

Recent studies have indicated that the VP6 is able to elicit protection against rotavirus shedding in mouse model [3] . A CD4 + T-cell epitope in VP6 might be effective for protection against rotavirus shedding [4] . There is the potential for VP6 expressed in transgenic plants to be developed into a rotavirus subunit vaccine.",

            "text": "Increase of the expression levels of foreign proteins in transgenic plants is a key for development of practical biopharmaceuticals, especially subunit edible vaccine. So far, the expression levels of viral protein in transgenic plants reported were from 0.001% of total soluble protein for rabies virus glycoprotein [15] to 0.37% for Norwalk virus capsid protein [12] . Several approaches have been reported to increase expression levels in transgenic plants, for example, modification of plant promoters for transcription of the genes and insertion of plant 5 -or 3 -untranslated regions for increase of mRNA stability and translatability [17, 19] . Mitsuhara et al. [16] have reported that a CaMV 35S promoter with duplicated enhancer linked to the tobacco mosaic virus 5 -untranslated leader sequence enhanced expression levels of the \u03b2-glucuronidase gene. In the present study, the same promoter cassette increased theVP6 expression levels in transgenic potatoes to the maximum level of 0.1% of the total soluble protein. Evaluation of protective immunity of the VP6 in the transgenic potato tubers by feeding mouse is in progress. In addition, production of transgenic potatoes expressing VP2 is now under way for our first goal to produce self-assembled rotavirus-like particles by crossbreeding of VP2 and VP6 transgenic potato plants, which were produced by a baculovirus expression system [5] .",
