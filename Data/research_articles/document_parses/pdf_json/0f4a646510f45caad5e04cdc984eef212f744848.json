Few data about the molecular epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus in developing countries, such as Jordan, are available. The frequency and severity of infections caused by HRSV were assessed in hospitalized Jordanian children <5 years of age compared with other potential etiological agents. Overall a potential pathogen was detected in 78% (254/326) of the children. HRSV was detected in 43% (140/326) of the nasopharyngeal aspirates. HRSV was found more frequently during the winter (January/February), being less frequent or negligible by spring (March/April). Analysis of 135 HRSV-positive strains using restriction fragment length polymorphism showed that 94 (70%) belonged to subgroup A, and 41 (30%) to subgroup B. There were also two cases of mixed genotypic infection. Only four of the six previously described N genotypes were detected with NP4 predominating. There were no associations between subgroup or N-genogroup and disease severity. HRSV was significantly associated with more severe acute respiratory infection and the median age of children with HRSV was lower than for those without. Next in order of frequency were adenovirus (116/312: 37%), human bocavirus (57/312: 18%), rhinovirus (36/325: 11%), Chlamydia spp. (14/312: 4.5%), human metapneumovirus (8/326: 2.5%), human coronavirus NL63 (4/325: 1.2%), and influenza A virus (2/323: 0.6%). Influenza B; parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human coronavirus HKU1 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were not detected.",

Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the leading viral cause of acute respiratory infection in infants and young children in terms of prevalence and effect [Shay et al., 2001] . HRSV causes substantial annual winter epidemics in temperate climates, representing a major cause of pediatric hospitalizations and a serious economic burden [Viegas et al., 2004] . HRSV can cause reinfections throughout the child's life and it can infect infants in the presence of maternal antibodies. This could be due to either an inadequate immune response or to the extensive genetic variability of the virus. Although antigenic variation is not essential for reinfection, growing evidence suggests that it may contribute to reinfections by immune evasion [Viegas and Mistchenko, 2005] . It has also been reported that HRSVspecific T-cell responses do not provide protection against reinfection, and reinfection does not boost HRSV-specific T-cell proliferation [Bont et al., 2002] .",

            "text": "HRSV is an enveloped RNA virus that is classified within the Pneumovirus genus as a member of the family Paramyxoviridae [Collins et al., 2001] . The virus has a non-segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense genome. Its genome encodes 10 proteins, including two major surface glycoproteins (G and F), two matrix proteins (M 1 and M 2 ), a small hydrophobic protein (SH), and three nucleocapsid associated proteins (N, P, and L) [Collins et al., 1984] . The two antigenic glycoproteins G and F are responsible for host cell attachment and viral entry by membrane fusion, respectively [Palomo et al., 2000] . HRSV is divided into two major antigenic subgroups, A and B, on the basis of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies against the major structural glycoproteins G and F [Mufson et al., 1985] . However, these two subgroups can be further subdivided into genotypes by restriction analysis and nucleotide sequence variability [Sullender et al., 1993; Peret et al., 1998] . The N (nucleoprotein) gene is relatively well conserved between virus isolates, but the G gene shows much greater variability. The variation in these genes has been used to define HRSV typing schemes as N gene differences resulting in the NP1-NP6 genotypes.",

Oxygen saturation (pO 2 ) was measured by using pulse oximetry (Nellcor Puritan Bennett NPB-195, UK) and a pO 2 85% used as the cut-off for giving supplementary oxygen. A standardized questionnaire containing clinical, socio-demographic, therapeutic, and outcome data was completed for each patient. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected by instilling 1 ml sterile phosphate-buffered saline through a sterile nasopharyngeal mucous extractor. The aspirates were frozen at \u00c0808C until analyzed in the Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Liverpool, UK. The genome of HRSV was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [Greensill et al., 2003] .

            "text": "Overall 102 (31.2%) of the children had more than one potential pathogen detected in their nasopharyngeal aspirates. This is perhaps not surprising as the respiratory viral seasons often co-incide [Choi et al., 2006] , and increasing the range of potential pathogens sought (in this study 10 viral and 2 bacterial pathogens) will reveal more co-infections. In 68 children the copathogens were HRSV with one or more other pathogen. However in no case was a co-infection with HRSV and HMPV encountered. Such co-infection has previously been linked with more severe acute respiratory infection in some [Greensill et al., 2003; Semple et al., 2005; Foulongne et al., 2006] but not all studies [Maggi et al., 2003; Wilkesmann et al., 2006] . HMPV was less frequently detected (2.5% of cases) than in some other hospital based studies [Al-Sonboli et al., 2005; Semple et al., 2005] . However the peak prevalence of HMPV infections does seem to vary year by year and the HRSV and HMPV seasons are not always concurrent [Serafino et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2006] .",
