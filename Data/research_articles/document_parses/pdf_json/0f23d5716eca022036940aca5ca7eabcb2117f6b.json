There is no true value for R 0 as it varies in different parts of the UK (and the world). In particular, in rural areas one would expect a considerably lower value of R 0 than in London. Authors of [3] suggest R 0 = 2.2 and R 0 = 2.4 as typical; the authors of [6] use values for R 0 in the range [2.25, 2.75 ]. We shall use the value R 0 = 2.5 as typical which may be a slightly pessimistic choice overall but could be an adequate choice for the mega-cities where the epidemics develop faster and may lead to more causalities.",

This implies that we assume that the average longevity of the period of time while the infected person is contagious is 21 days, in line with the current knowledge, see e.g. [7, 8, 9] . Standard deviation of the chosen Erlang distribution is approximately 12, which is rather large and reflects the uncertainty we currently have about the period of time a person needs to recover (or die) from COVID-19. An increase in 1/\u03c3 would prolong the epidemic and smaller values of 1/\u03c3 would make it to cause people to be contagious for less time. The use of Erlang distribution is standard for modelling similar events in reliability and queuing theories, which have much in common with epidemiology. We have considered the sensitivity of the model in this study with respect to the choice of parameters \u03bb and \u03c3 but more has to be done in cooperation with epidemiologists. As there are currently many outbreaks epidemics, new knowledge about the distribution of the period of infection by COVID-19 can emerge soon.",

These, and many more possibilities, have a non-negligible probability of occurring, and they have devastating effects. In future models we will try to address these possibilities.",

In this figure, for the initial data of Figure 1 , we strongly separate group G at the time when 10% of the population is infected. We make no call to the general public for social distancing. In this scenario, the intervention does not considerably change the proportion of infected in the total population but it significantly 'flattens the curve' for the group G: compare the purple and green lines. The maximum of I G (t)/n is 0.086 which is 2.5 times lower than 0.216, the maximum of I(t)/N . Note also the fact that the curve I G (t)/n is rather flat for long time, during the main stage of development of the epidemic. Just after the peak of The scenario which led to Figure 6 is important and hence it has been re-run for a few variations of the model. Figure 7 shows the results of the simulations where we have removed the incubation period. The maximum of I G (t)/n is now 0.075 which is more than twice lower than 1.63, the maximum of I(t)/N .

We make no call to general public for social distancing. The curve I G (t)/n is 'flattened' for the group G but in a considerably smaller degree than in the case of strong separation of G. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the situation with mild and strong separation of people from G complemented with introduction of the social distancing for general public. Interestingly enough, the effect of social distancing for general public gives less benefit than even mild isolation of people from group G. Figure 11 illustrates the scenario with no call to the general public for social distancing but with strong separation of the people from G at at a later stage of epidemic, when 20% of the population is infected. The effect is similar to the one observed in Figures 6 and 7 except for the fact that the call for isolating the group G came slightly late. Conclusion. By considering a number of scenarios we have observed an extreme sensitivity of the negative consequences of the epidemic to the degree of separation of vulnerable people. Sensitivity to the parameter measuring the degree of self-isolation for the whole population is less apparent although it is much costlier.",

The maximal values of I(t)/N in the examples depicted in Figures 2-5 are 0.124, 0.136, 0.134 and 0.132, respectively. This is significantly lower than the value 0.163 for the original curve. In the assumptions of Example 1, these would respectively lead to the maximum expected number of deaths 57.7, 63.3, 62.9 and 62.7. Extra heterogeneity of different epidemics caused by the social and demographic heterogeneity of the sub-populations would further 'flatten the curve'. The following conclusions are in line with what the Israeli expert D. Yamin states [12]and agree with the main conclusions of the paper[14] which is rather critical towards standard epidemiological models.",

(a) Isolation of sub-populations at initial stages of an epidemic is very important for preserving heterogeneity of the epidemic and 'flattenning the curve'; this flattening can be very significant. (b) Epidemiological models based on the assumption of a homogeneous population but applied for populations consisting of heterogeneous sub-populations may give completely misleading results.",
