De-identified study data are collected and managed using the REDCap electronic data capture tool hosted at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom 15 . Of note, an optional, interactive augmented data collection has been implemented through a platform developed specifically for the study by Amazon Web Services Australia (AWS, Sydney, Australia). A physical device and associated software tools assist with de-identified data collection and their transfer to the REDCap database. This approach has no impact on the ownership of data, which remains with the individual site. Full encryption is used, beginning from data ingestion into the Amazon cloud, through to transfer to the REDCap web application.

To date, the characterization of patients admitted to ICUs with COVID-19 has been limited to national or single-center series. This study, using a large collaborative network, attempts to overcome the limitations induced by small patient numbers and geographic restrictions, by providing real-time global data. In a pandemic of an emerging pathogen, high-quality, real-time information is crucial to guide an optimal response. The speed of this response and cumulative experience of ICUs worldwide offer the best framework for determining evidencebased best practices and, therefore, improving outcomes for those requiring critical care.",
