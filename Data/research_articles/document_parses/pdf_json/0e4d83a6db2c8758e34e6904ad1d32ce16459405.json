Therefore, the current article investigates how to design a socially assistive painting robot which uses a personalized model to visually convey emotions, as illustrated in Figure 1 -this involves exploring a general art-making strategy, as well as how to build and apply such a personalized model, also considering the degree to which art is abstracted.

Research prototyping and constructive design allow researchers to gain pragmatic insight into complex phenomena in the real world, where computer simulations and deduction would be insufficient for understanding. Mid-fidelity prototyping additionally provides a useful balance of accurate insight into how a finalized system might perform, while allowing results to be obtained quickly and practically. Furthermore, collaboration between artists and engineers can have positive synergistic effects (St-Onge et al., 2011) . Thus, some first exploration was conducted with two artists and some engineering students, which involved the artists trying different setups with the students controlling the robot. One idea was that the robot could paint in a contingent way to indicate empathy, where the simplest way to suggest that a robot understands what a human has painted is direct mimicking, or painting the same thing the human has painted. This felt interesting, in that the robot seemed to have some perceptive capability, and the human's art was attributed enough importance to mimic, but merely copying also felt like the robot was a mere machine and not like a partner. Another enjoyable interaction involved an artist painting together, face-to-face, with the robot on a shared canvas, where the robot painted independently of the artist; although artistically interesting (due to the human artist's improvisation), the lack of a connection or bond also felt like a human working with a machine, not a partner. Thus, both strategies felt limiting due to their one-way nature, and led us to consider if a robot could produce art which balances exogenous and endogenous components to appear both empathetic and creative. Thus a robot could base its art partially on what the human is doing, and partially on its own intention (e.g., to help the human to feel happy).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 94, "end": 118, "text": "(Cooney and Berck, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 619, "end": 641, "text": "(St-Onge et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Painting together with a human"}, {"text": "Being able to both recognize what a human does, and produce something new based on this and the robot's own agenda, might indicate some degree of intelligence, as robots which are perceived as intentional agents with a mind (i.e., \"mind perception\") are more likely to be treated as a partner and be the recipients of empathy, morality or prosocial behaviors (Wiese et al., 2017) . Also, by creatively reshaping a human's emotional expression, the art might be more likely to be stimulating, thought-provoking, meaningful, and facilitating selfexploration. This approach additionally seemed to coincide with the \"responsive art\" approach in art therapy, in which a therapist provides visual feedback based on a person's art, which has been described as effective toward exploring the meaning of a person's art.

Grieving people could be painted beside a remorseful grave scene. A snake poised to strike could be painted beside a threatening gun. A bright set of balloons could be drawn beside a festive stack of presents. This idea is general and can also be applied to abstract art. For example, if a person uses diagonal lines to express arousal, a robot could instead use an aroused warm color. Thus, the term \"metaphor\" here is used to describe such differing symbols which are intended to express similar emotional meaning.

By contrast, the space for representational art is much more expansive; for example, no participant mentioned a small puppy in a cup in a grass field (the generic image) as something they would consider to express happiness. Another potential cause is that the participants might not have known themselves what kind of abstract art would make them feel a certain way. This was supported by some comments by participants. One potentially useful approach which could be considered was introduced in a paper by Lee at al., which proposed a reflective approach to personalization intended to empower users by querying to encourage thought about goals before starting an activity (Lee et al., 2015) ; one interesting feature of this work also was that, although robot designers typically try to avoid repetition which could bore humans, interviewed human experts suggested the importance of repeatedly querying users to get at hidden motivations. Finally, our measurements through a sparse open-ended survey might not have been sufficient to model the participant's preferences. Aside from merely introducing more questions and considering other factors such as composition, one more complex approach which might yield better results could be to use interactive personalization throughout a more extended period (Clabaugh, 2017) , possibly like the series of questions in an eye exam; similar to the work by Lee et al., de- spite foreseeing a possibility of survey fatigue, participants in this work reported enjoying being prompted frequently.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1040, "end": 1058, "text": "(Lee et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1688, "text": "(Clabaugh, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1783, "text": "Lee et al., de-", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Personalized abstract art"}, {"text": "The current work represents a simplified foray into a highly complex area; numerous improvements are likely to be possible by considering this complex phenomenon in more detail and replacing simplified assumptions with richer formulations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Art-making Strategy"}, {"text": "Art is highly complex.

This also relates to emotions; here single emotions were targeted, but emotions in the wild can be much more complex, from the perspective of mixed emotions, referents, timing (dependence on the \"residue\" of recent events), and polysemy. Moreover, from the perspective of the observer, art is polyvalent; the observer is likely to add their own bias in interpreting, also seeing spurious connections where there are none or nothing where there is a connection (i.e., pareidolia-randomania spectrum).

If symbols fit well together, like water, palm trees, sand, and a reclining chair, the robot could interpret this as one symbol for a beach. If symbols appear disparate, insight could be taken from an interesting study in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) that proposed that a robot should perhaps react to both typical patterns in a human's behavior as well as novel behaviors (Glas et al., 2017) . In the current context, this could mean, if a person paints a purple background more than once, or paints an uncommon symbol like an aye-aye, that the robot could react to this symbol; additionally, a robot could also focus more on symbols which have an extreme emotional meaning, like skulls, where the cost for ignoring it in a therapy session might be high.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 759, "end": 778, "text": "(Glas et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Art-making Strategy"}, {"text": "For the robot's art, the robot can also seek to have a model of the distributions of symbols, and how to position symbols on the canvas in relation to the human's art to make intended references clear, given the commingling and contiguity of symbols.

Also, the interaction overall should be considered: art generated through an interaction features a chiasmic relationship; a cycle of entrainment can ensue in which a robot reacts to the human's art, and the human reacts to the robot's art, also over possibly many sessions. A more complex system could choose different locations to paint, whether the robot's and human's art should fit seamlessly together like a symbolon or if there can be a visible gradient, and whether the robot can modify the human's art, etc. A robot can also make a judgement of how critical it is to convey meaning clearly.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Art-making Strategy"}, {"text": "In therapy for a first time user, monosemous symbols could be preferred for clarity, whereas some errors could be allowed in playing with an experienced user.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Art-making Strategy"}, {"text": "Another assumption in the current work is that a desirable initial strategy could involve partial matching by a robot that acts as a human's partner in art-making for enjoyment or therapy.

Rather, for a first step it was felt that ignoring a person and painting something positive might less challenging of a task than finding an approach to accomplish such partial matching, such that both matching and distraction could be combined, either spatially or temporally.

For behavior, attitudes toward animals can vary strongly, such as in people with allergies or traumatic experiences; approaching with a smile or recoiling in fear from an animal could indicate positive or negative emotions. An example of how culture can affect emotions perceived in art is how gothic subculture attributes positive characteristics to dark expressions which are otherwise often considered to be negative such as black, skulls, or graves. For preferences, smiling can be seen as positive or negative (e.g., showing empathy or derision); or, one person might like the thrill of action movies, whereas another might detest violence.

A person might not want to admit that they have an emotional reaction to a stimulus in front of a stranger, or find a stimulus more pleasant when seen with a friend.
