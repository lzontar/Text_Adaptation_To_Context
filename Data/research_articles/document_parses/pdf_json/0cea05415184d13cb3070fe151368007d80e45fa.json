The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The last comparable crisis was the pandemic of Spanish Flu in 1918-1919 caused by H1N1 viruses with genes of avian origin. 3 About 500 million people or onethird of the world's population were infected with the Spanish Flu viruses and at least 50 million people perished around the world including about 675,000 in the U.S. 3 The Spanish Flu epidemic was associated with an increase in death by suicide. 4 It has been proposed that a decrease in social integration and interaction during the epidemic and the fears caused by the epidemic likely increased suicide. 4 It is important to note that social isolation and fears are common during the current COVID-19 epidemic. 2 There was a significant increase in suicide deaths among people aged 65 and over during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. 5 Research indicates that this increase in suicides can be attributed to fears of contracting the illness, fears of being a burden to the family, general anxiety, social isolation, and psychological distress.",

A 36-year-old Bangladeshi man killed himself because he and people in his village thought that he was infected with COVID-19 because he had fever and cold symptoms. 20 A postmortem examination showed that he did not have COVID-19. The 49 year-old head of the Emergency Department in a New York City hospital died by suicide after telling her family about the tremendous suffering and death she witnessed while taking care of coronavirus patients. 21 Also, there is a huge increase of calls to suicide prevention hotlines in the U.S. during the current COVID 19 epidemic. 22 In summary, studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population.",

For example, the Quebec Health Survey showed that living alone and having no friends were associated with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. 30 Social disengagement played a role in the increased suicide rate during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. 5 One third of SARS-related suicide victims experienced social isolation during the SARS outbreak. From a suicide prevention perspective, it is troubling that the most important public health approach for the COVID-19 epidemic is social distancing.",

Sleep disturbances are a stand-alone risk factor for suicidal behavior. 32 Uncertainty, especially economic uncertainty is associated with stress-related disorders and suicide. 2, 23, 33, 34 It has been shown that uncertainty is a more stressful state to be in than really knowing something bad will happen. 35 Uncertainty is associated with depression and anxiety. 33 In one research investigation, daily suicide data from England and Wales were matched to a daily economic policy uncertainty index over the period 2001-2015. 34 The authors found that a spike in daily economic uncertainty lead to an immediate impact on suicides which suggest that economic uncertainty may lead to an increase in the risk of suicide.",

The authors observed that negative emotions including anxiety, depression and anger rose, while the positive emotions and life satisfaction diminished. Xiao et al. 10 studied a relationship between social capital as measured by the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) and sleep characteristics in person who were isolated during the COVID-19 epidemic. Researchers observed that anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. Xiao et al. 10 wrote that \"anxiety and stress of isolated individuals were at high levels, while the sleep quality was low.\" Ahmed et al. 11 did an online survey of 1074 Chinese people and found elevated rates of anxiety, depression, harmful alcohol use and decrease in mental wellbeing. 11 Rates of anxiety and depression were higher among young people aged 21-40 years in comparison to other age groups. Huang and Zhao 12 conducted a web-based survey of 7,236 individuals in China. The overall prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms, and sleep abnormalities were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. This study also showed that health care professionals were more likely to have poor sleep quality in comparison to other occupational groups. Lai et al. 13 examined a state of mental health of 1257 health care professionals in China. 50.4% of study participants reported depression, 44.6% anxiety, 34.0% insomnia, and 71.5% distress. Frontline health care professionals who were taking care of patients with coronavirus disease had a higher risk of having symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress in comparison to other medical professionals. In March 2020, Ahmed et al. 14 did an online study to examine anxiety and fear of getting infected among dentists. The authors received responses from 669 dentists from 30 countries. An overwhelming majority of study participants reported anxiety and fear of contagion. Some dentists closed their practices for an indefinite period of time.",

            "text": "Suicide rates also increased in other countries during the Great Depression. For example, Varnik 39 reported a rise in suicide death in Estonia in the early 1930s. Reeves et al. 40 observed that almost all European countries have experienced rising suicide rates during the 2008-2010 recession. The authors estimated that, in total, there were at least 10,000 more economic suicides during the recession in the European Union, Canada and the USA than would have been expected. Economic decline during and after the COVID-19 pandemic will probably have a powerful and harmful effect on mental health and result in an increase in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior. It is important to note that financial problems may reduce access to psychiatric treatment. There is a high probability that the COVID-19 survivors especially survivors who had severe COVID-19 are at elevated suicide risk. 41 Stressful experiences such as learning about the diagnosis of COVID-19, fear of infecting others, symptoms of the illness, hospitalization, especially admission to an intensive care unit, and loss of income may lead to the development of anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress disorder. 41,42 A recent study in China indicated that 96.2% of recovering COVID-19patients had significant posttraumatic stress symptoms.43 Around 50% of recovered patients remained anxious after the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong.44",

For men, the rate grew 26% from 17.8 in 1999 to 22.4 in 2017. If suicide rates increase in the U.S., it will add to the trend of rising national rates of suicide. An increase in suicide rates may become a significant public health issue in other countries. Suicide prevention in the COVID-19 era In 1994, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) Committee on Prevention of Mental Disorders suggested that prevention of psychiatric conditions should be divided into three categories: universal preventive interventions, selective preventive interventions, and indicated preventive interventions. 51,52 Suicide prevention efforts during the COVID-19 crisis can also classified as either universal, selective, or indicated.",
