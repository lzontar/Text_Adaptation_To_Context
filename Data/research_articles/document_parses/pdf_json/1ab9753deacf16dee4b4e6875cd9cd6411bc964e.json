            "text": "M any human plasma-derived and biotechnology products are life-saving medicines. They, however, present the unique safety issue of potential viral contamination. This contamination could occur through source plasma that contains pathogenic viruses or the introduction of adventitious viruses during manufacture. To prevent contamination of biological products, manufacturers have integrated a number of measures into the production processes. These include careful selection and screening of source materials and demonstration that manufacturing processes have sufficient capacity to remove or inactivate relevant and model viruses [1] [2] [3] [4] . Viral validation studies are performed to demonstrate the potential of manufacturing processes to clear adventitious viral contaminants. To ensure the integrity of viral validation studies, and thus ensure the viral safety of biological products, regulatory agencies worldwide have required these studies to be performed in accordance with the principles of the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) [1] . Bayer HealthCare manufactures biological products of human plasma origin and a biotechnology product derived from cell culture. Recently, a comprehensive GLP compliance program was established for viral validation studies relating to these products. Viral validation studies are different from the traditional toxicology safety studies for which GLPs were originally promulgated, and they presented some unique challenges in applying GLP regulations. 1 While the impetus for establishment of our GLP program was primarily viral validations, it was also important to make the compliance program comprehensive enough to meet the needs of other groups within Research and Development, such as BioAnalytics and Toxicology. Described here is our approach to meet the challenges of implementing GLP compliance into non-toxicology safety studies for biological products.",

Plasma donors are screened to ensure good health and the donated plasma is tested for known clinically significant viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Plasma testing occurs at two levels; individual plasma units, in mini-pools, are tested and just prior to manufacture, production pools are tested. For the recombinant product, the source material is cell culture supernatant fluid. Since cell lines may carry viruses, they are well characterized before use to identify possible viral contaminants. In addition, raw materials, process intermediates and final bulks are tested for adventitious viruses. Testing of source materials for plasma-derived and recombinant products is inherent to the manufacturing process, and as such, is governed by Current Good Manufacturing Practicies (cGMPs).",

The purification processes for these proteins may have dual functions: purifying active protein components from plasma or cell culture supernatant and removing or inactivating viruses. Often, dedicated viral removal or inactivation steps are incorporated into the production streams to provide additional viral clearance capacity [5, 6] . The overall viral clearance capacity of the manufacturing process for a biological product must be sufficient and robust, which is particularly important in light of the recent resurgence of infectious agents such as West Nile virus, monkeypox virus, and the emergence of new viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [7] . Studies to validate virus clearance are in support of the safety of the product and must be performed using a small-scale model of the manufacturing process and in compliance with GLPs.",
