Morpholinos are typically used to block translation of mRNA and to block splicing of pre-mRNA, though they can block other interactions between biological macromolecules and RNA. Morpholinos are effective, specific, and lack non-antisense effects. They work in any cell that transcribes and translates RNA, but must be delivered into the nuclear/cytosolic compartment to be effective. Morpholinos form stable base pairs with complementary nucleic acid sequences but apparently do not bind to proteins to a significant extent. They are not recognized by any proteins and do not undergo protein-mediated catalysis-nor do they mediate RNA cleavage by RNase H or the RISC complex.

The Morpholino phosphorodiamidate backbone of Morpholinos consists of morpholine rings that bear methylene groups that are bound to modified phosphates in which the anionic oxygen is replaced by a nonionic dimethylamino group. The substituted phosphate is bound through a phosphorus-nitrogen bond to the nitrogen atom of another morpholine ring. One standard DNA nucleobase (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine) is bound to each morpholine ring. The ends of Morpholinos are conventionally named 3 and 5 by analogy with the nomenclature for nucleic acids (though if one were to number the atoms of a Morpholino oligonucleotide backbone by IUPAC rules, the numbers assigned to the ends would be different). The secondary amine of the morpholine ring at the end of an unmodified Morpholino oligonucleotide is called the 3 end of the oligo, whereas the 5 end terminates with a carboxamidated phosphorodiamidate group (Fig. 4 .30.1).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 190, "end": 198, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1217, "text": "(Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Antisense Morpholinos block the interactions of macromolecules with mRNA by base pairing with the targeted mRNA in a complementary fashion, thus preventing initiation complex read-through or modification of splicing in cells ranging from bacterial (Geller et al., 2005) to human (Suwanmanee et al., 2002) .

Practitioners of nuclear medicine strive to minimize radiation exposure of a patient while delivering radionuclides to target tissues for imaging or for therapeutic applications. By attaching radioisotopes to antibodies that are specific for target tissues, the antibodies can anchor isotopes on these tissues. Because the large antibody molecules diffuse slowly, the isotopes must be maintained in the plasma at high concentrations or for long durations to achieve good delivery of radioisotope-linked antibodies to their targets. Pretargeting with Morpholinos involves introducing an antibody-Morpholino conjugate into the bloodstream; this can be done using high concentrations or re-dosing to saturate the target without exposing the patient to radiation during this pretargeting stage. Next, a conjugate of a radioisotope (possibly chelated) with a complementary Morpholino is added to the blood. Because the Morpholino has a much smaller molecular mass than an antibody, the radionuclide-Morpholino conjugate diffuses relatively quickly and is captured at the target tissue more rapidly through Morpholino-Morpholino pairing. Unbound radionuclide-Morpholino conjugate is rapidly eliminated through the kidneys. This technique allows delivery of radioisotopes to the targeted tissue while exposing the organism to lower doses of radiation away from the targeted region. In the process of developing these techniques, pharmacokinetics of Morpholino-radionuclide conjugates have been studied in vivo (Liu et al., 2002a,b; He et al., 2003) .

If small self-complementary sequences are separated by zero to a few bases, formation of a stable stem-loop is unlikely because a hairpin with a small loop is not energetically favored. To prevent loss of oligo activity through competition between self-pairing and target binding, it is prudent to limit selfcomplementary sequences in oligo designs to 16 contiguous hydrogen bonds or less, where CG pairs contribute three hydrogen bonds and AT pairs contribute two hydrogen bonds. For instance, the short sequences ATGGC and GC-CAT can form 13 contiguous hydrogen bonds (2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13). When analyzing sequences for self-complementarity, check for both Watson-Crick base-pairing and for GT base-pairing. Like an AT pair, a GT pair also forms two hydrogen bonds. However, because the overall stability of the GT pair is far lower than an AT pair, a GT pair can be scored as a single hydrogen bond when calculating its contribution to the stability of a self-complementary moiety (Aboul-ela et al., 1985 ).

Endo-Porter is an amphiphilic peptide that becomes cationic at low pH. In culture medium, Endo-Porter is uncharged but sticks to the surface of cells. Upon endocytosis, Endo-Porter is protonated in the acidic endosome and permeabilizes the endosomal membrane, releasing the endosomal contents into the cytoplasm. Morpholinos co-endocytosed with membraneassociated Endo-Porter are released into the cytoplasm when the endosome is permeabilized (Summerton, 2005) . Endo-Porter allows simultaneous delivery of multiple Morpholinos. The concentration of Morpholinos can be varied independently of the Endo-Porter concentration, allowing dose-response antisense studies while holding the delivery reagent concentration constant. Cells treated with a 5 \u03bcM carboxyfluoresceinated Morpholino and 8 \u03bcM Endo-Porter gave transfection efficiencies of 82% for human amnion-derived WISH cells and 78% for human myometrial cells when assayed by confocal microscopy (Tyson-Capper and Europe-Finner, 2006) , though concentrations too low to be detected by fluorescence might still be sufficient to have measurable antisense activity.

The Morpholino gave rise to a severe vascular tube formation phenotype not seen in the mutant, which was shown to carry a severe or null mutation. Fish with egfl7 mutated were injected with the egfl7 Morpholino and surprisingly these fish had a reduced incidence of the vascular phenotype compared to wild-type fish injected with the same Morpholino, indicating that the mutant fish were less sensitive to the Morpholino than the wild-type fish; this was the first hint that a change in the mutant fish might conceal the phenotype the Morpholino induced in wild-type fish. The vascular defect phenotype associated with the Morpholino was recapitulated in experiments using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to inhibit egfl7 expression. Comparison of over 6000 protein concentrations by 4-hr 'single shot' liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) found one protein that was strongly up-regulated (>5\u00d7) in the mutants compared to the morphants; this protein, Emilin3a, shares an important functional structure, the EMI domain, with Egfl7, and might be compensating for the loss of egfl7 in the mutants. RNA sequencing and qPCR found emilin3a, emilin3b, and emilin2a up-regulated in the egfl7 mutants but not in embryos with egfl7 knocked down by Morpholinos or CRISPRi. When co-injected with the egfl7 Morpholino, mRNAs for Emilin2 or Emilin3 were able to rescue the circulatory phenotype.
