It focuses on emerging diseases and recent geographic shifts in the presence of disease vectors. Recent Findings Mosquito and tick vectors have become more widespread as environmental conditions have become more favorable. Zika recently has emerged as a concern for fetal anomalies. West Nile Virus has become widespread. Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases are more prevalent in areas previously inhospitable to these ticks. Summary Healthcare providers must consider the possibility of mosquito-and tick-borne diseases in broader geographic areas and council patients traveling to endemic areas on precautions against these diseases. Treatment for suspected cases of serious tick-borne illnesses should not be delayed pending culture results.",

Disease prevalence follows a geographic pattern based on the distribution of its primary vector, the Ixodes tick, and its mammalian life cycle hosts, the white-tailed deer and white-footed mouse [6] . Recent studies have concluded that climate change may have sizeable effects on its epidemiology [7\u2022\u2022, 8] . A 2018 study employed fixed effects analysis to examine the impact of climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation in 15 North American states with the highest incidence of Lyme disease. These results were used to project a greater than 20% increase in Lyme disease cases in the USA, assuming a midcentury 2\u00b0C increase in temperature as predicted by the U.S. National Climate Assessment [8] .",

If left untreated, this is followed by early disseminated disease, which typically causes inflammation of the heart and nervous systems. The most common cardiac presentation is an AV nodal heart block, although peri-and myocarditis may also occur [9] . The most common neurologic presentations are nerve palsies and meningitis [9] . Late disease, which occurs months to years after a tick bite, most commonly presents as mono-or polyarticular arthritis.

It is important to remember that patients can remain immunoblot positive from past infections [11] . A 2015 systematic review and metaanalysis was unable to find evidence proving superiority of a two-tiered approach when compared to single tests [11, 12] . Treatment options for early localized disease include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime. Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 10-21 days) is recommended for most patients based on its efficacy against co-infections transmitted through Ixodes subspecies such as anaplasmosis [9] . Amoxicillin, 50 mg/kg daily divided into three daily doses, is recommended as first-line treatment in pediatric patients with early disease. For early disseminated disease presenting with Bell's palsy, oral doxycycline is recommended. For other neurologic manifestations such as meningitis, symptomatic carditis, or AV block, patients should be admitted to hospital for monitoring and IV antibiotics [9] . Two to 3 weeks of an IV cephalosporin with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration is recommended for meningitis [9] . Late Lyme disease is typically treated with IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G for 28 days.",

Treatment should not be delayed until the appearance of a rash or other characteristic symptom in cases with a high clinical suspicion for RMSF. While the incidence of SFR continues to rise, mortality and morbidity have decreased since the mid-1900s due to the availability of tetracyclines and a recent push for early antibiotics in suspected cases [22, 27] . The leading predictor of fatality in RSMF is a delay in antibiotics. Doxycycline is the preferred antibiotic for all ages and regardless of pregnancy status [28] . For adults and children weighing over 45 kg, 100 mg should be administered twice daily either intravenously or orally. For children under 45 kg, the recommended doxycycline dose is 2.2 mg/kg/dose twice daily. Treatment should be continued for at least 3 days following resolution of fever, which can range from 42 h to 5 days depending on the severity of illness [29] . Doxycycline has been shown to prevent severe morbidity and mortality if given within 5 days of symptom onset [22, 29] . Despite this recommendation, as recently as 2014, only 35% of healthcare providers were willing to use doxycycline in suspected pediatric RMSF cases due to occurrences of dental staining caused by older generations of tetracyclines [30\u2022 ]. However, studies by the CDC and Indian Health Services failed to show any dental discoloration or enamel hypoplasia in children under 8 years of age who received short-term courses of doxycycline [31, 32] .",

However, the bacteria have not been isolated from a human with STARI. Even positive PCR testing has been limited to one case [46] . In addition, testing of 31 patients with presumed STARI in Missouri failed to yield evidence of infection by B. lonestari so the cause of STARI remains unknown [48] . As with many ticks, the lone star tick's range has expanded, with the ticks found as far west as central Texas and as far North as Maine [49] .

The febrile phase lasts 2-7 days and may include headache, myalgias/arthralgias, and mild hemorrhagic symptoms (petechiae, ecchymosis, purpura, epistaxis) [101] . Some dengue patients develop Herman's rash, a diffuse erythematous rash with circular blanched foci, which is considered pathognomonic for the disease [99] .
