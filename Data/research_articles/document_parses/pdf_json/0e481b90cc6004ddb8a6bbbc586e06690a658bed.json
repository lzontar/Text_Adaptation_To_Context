She was in no acute distress and appeared comfortable. Lung auscultation was unremarkable, as was the remainder of her physical examination. There was no evidence of VTE on examination.

The following morning on hospital day 8, she began complaining of right lower extremity pain. Physical examination was concerning for absent dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial (PT) artery pulses in her right foot, which was cooler than her contralateral foot. She was found to have diminished sensation in the plantar aspect of her right foot, consistent with Rutherford class IIa ALI. Vascular surgery was consulted and, due to her precarious respiratory status, need for further imaging and likely surgery, she was intubated, then sent for CT angiography of her lower extremities. CT demonstrated acute thrombosis of the right below-knee popliteal artery with minimal opacification of the tibial vessels (Fig. 1) . On return from the CT scanner, she developed worsening hypotension, leading to initiation of norepinephrine. She was started on a continuous therapeutic infusion of unfractionated heparin with a goal activated partial thromboplastin time of 55-90 seconds and was taken to the operating room on an emergent basis for revascularization. The popliteal artery was exposed via a below-the-knee incision. A transverse arteriotomy was made and an occlusive thrombus was noted within the vessel. A long, gelatinous clot was extracted from the popliteal artery. Next, number 3 and number 4 Fogarty embolectomy catheters were passed proximally and distally with retrieval of additional clot. The clot consistency was more gelatinous and darker than is typically seen during embolectomy done for acute arterial thrombus. Reevaluation of distal flow demonstrated continued absence of pedal Doppler signals. Intraoperative angiography was performed which revealed opacification of the belowknee popliteal artery with minimal collateral outflow ( Fig. 2A) . Further dissection was performed to expose the anterior tibial artery and the tibioperoneal trunk. Guided Fogarty embolectomy was performed through each of the three tibial vessels with a number 2 and number 3 Fogarty embolectomy catheters. There was no retrieval of thrombus nor any back-bleeding from the anterior tibial artery or the peroneal artery. Minimal thrombus was retrieved from the PT artery with passage of the catheter down to the level of the foot. Slow back-bleeding was noted. Repeat angiography revealed flow in the PT artery to the distal leg with no flow to the pedal arch (Fig. 2, B and C). Decision was made to proceed with distal arterial cutdown. An incision was made at the level of the ankle and the PT artery was exposed. A transverse arteriotomy was made and a number 2 Fogarty embolectomy catheter was passed proximally and distally. A small amount of thrombus was retrieved after which there was significantly improved inflow. At this point, the patient was found to have a biphasic PT artery Doppler signal at the level of the ankle. Pharmacologic thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was not performed, as adequate blood flow had been restored. Following a four-compartment fasciotomy, incisions were closed and dressings were applied.

However, it is increasingly evident that COVID-19 is a systemic disease with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and hematologic manifestations (6) (7) (8) (9) . In this patient, the development of arterial thrombosis preceded development of shock and progression of her respiratory failure, necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation. VTE is a frequent complication in COVID-19 patients. The occurrence rate of VTE in critically ill COVID patients is estimated at 25-25%, which is higher than in the overall ICU population (4, 5, 10) . Those patients who developed VTE were noted to have higher d-dimer scores than those without (4, 5) . Similarly, the development of arterial thrombosis in our patient was heralded by a dramatic increase in her d-dimer level (Table 1 ). In this case, the marked increase in her d-dimer level was likely attributable to her hypercoagulable and pro-inflammatory state, as opposed to a consumptive coagulopathy. This is evidenced by her normal fibrinogen and platelet count and elevated CRP level around the time of her thrombotic event. In one case series, only 3.7% of critically ill COVID-19 patients were found to have arterial thrombosis-all cerebral infarctions (4). Our patient was also noted to be positive for an anti-phospholipid antibody, which has also been noted in a small case series of COVID patients with venous thromboses (11) . A recently published cohort study from Lombardy, Italy, demonstrated a higher-than-expected incidence of ALI due to arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 pneumonia patients (12) .

In this case, however, revascularization was very difficult and required multiple interventions, which is notable given the acuity of the thrombosis.
