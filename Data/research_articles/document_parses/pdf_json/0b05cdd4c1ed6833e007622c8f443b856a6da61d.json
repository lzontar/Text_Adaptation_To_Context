            "text": "Over the few past years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have witnessed a significant evolution in the academic and industrial community. MOOCs give more flexibility and convenience in taking the course through many helpful learning experiences to students, such as video lectures, assignments, exams. It also provides the opportunity to connect and collaborate with others through discussion forums. Despite this great success, MOOCs still suffer from a high drop out rate [7] . Although many causes exist for this problem, students' confusion and frustration are one of the main reason behind it. Confusion can be defined as a blockage or dilemmas where the learner is uncertain how to proceed with the learning process. In MOOCs, there are several ways for learners to express confusion through retaking assessment or rewatching/slowing down videos. However, in most cases, learners tend more to reveal their confusion via online discussion forums through questions and posts, where each learner can express clearly his struggles in more details [2, 11] . Due to the absence of physical access to tutors, it is harder to early detect learners confusion about a particular concept or learning materials. On the other hand, Deep learning [5] and natural language processing (NLP) [9] are two artificial intelligence subfields used widely in e-learning. They aim to analyse learners posted messages and predict their different behaviours. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm, is a new technique that reveals a very high performance over previous NLP techniques [1] . Published by Jacob Devlin in 2018 [6] , BERT is based on attention mechanism that learns contextual relations between words in the text [10] .",

Our approach is mainly composed of two principal subsystems: a prerequisite based ontology and a text classification using the BERT algorithm. First, at every end of the coursework, an intelligent tutor introduces the knowledge concept that should be acquired at this level of the learning process. The concepts generally do not exist alone; some concepts are the prerequisites of other concepts; Thus, for a student to master a chosen concept, he should usually master its prerequisites. Therefore, Based on OWL prerequisites ontology [3] , we extract all the prerequisites of the introduced concept. The use of ontologies provides a useful tool for the representation of concepts, performance and relationships more adequately. After extracting all related prerequisites concepts, we filter by those concepts/terms all the messages posted in the discussion forums of MOOCs in this period. In this way, we only get posts related to the concept in question, alongside posts with the prerequisite concepts. This method will help to classify the confusion level based on only the chosen concept.",

Each post in the MOOC Posts dataset was scored across six different dimensions, including the confusion. In the confusion dimension, coders ranked the confusion of the post on a scale of 1 to 7. A score of 1 means the post writer is not confused, while 7 means he is perplexed. We re-score the posts to limit confusion in three degrees, in the manner that posts with label inferior to 3.5 have the new label of 0 (unconfused). Posts with a label of 4 get the new label 1 (neutral), and the messages with score superior to 4.5 will be assigned the label 2 (confused).",
