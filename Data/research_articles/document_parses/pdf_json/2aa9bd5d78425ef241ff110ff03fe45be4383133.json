The argument that work from the viral-challenge trials are relevant here is based on similarities among the symptoms of colds, influenza, and COVID-19 and in the role of proinflammatory cytokine regulation in disease pathogenesis, as well as on the consistency of psychosocial factors as predictors of disease susceptibility across multiple respiratory viruses. The hypotheses for the generality of each factor discussed here are made with caution, because although there are similarities among colds, influenza, and COVID-19, there are also major differences (Paules, Marston, & Fauci, 2020) . Do our data tell us anything specifically about the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic? It is generally accepted that sheltering at home, quarantine for ill patients, and job loss can trigger psychological distress, anxiety, and depression (reviewed by Brooks et al., 2020) and that strong support networks may attenuate these effects (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Our work suggests that chronic interpersonal and employment-related stressors are also potent risks for upper respiratory disease for those exposed to respiratory viruses and that social integration and social support may confer resilience. Diverse networks and strong support systems may be especially beneficial to the extent that network contact can be maintained by phone, social media, Zoom, FaceTime, and so forth (Hobbs, Burke, Christakis, & Fowler, 2016) . It is also possible that those with low levels of support and social integration suffer more in quarantine because of a lack of contacts to engage when isolated. Overall, the evidence from the viral-challenge trials indicates that the experiences associated with the quarantine (including sheltering at home), its potential for interpersonal stressors (including isolation, loneliness and conflict), and the loss of employment are particularly powerful predictors of host resistance to respiratory viruses. In turn, it is possible that they might play a similar role in susceptibility to COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 987, "end": 1019, "text": "(Paules, Marston, & Fauci, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1303, "text": "Brooks et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1837, "end": 1879, "text": "(Hobbs, Burke, Christakis, & Fowler, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Final Comments"}, {"text": "Action Editor: Laura A.
