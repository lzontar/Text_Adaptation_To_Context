Foreigners seeking regularization must have access to immediate, free, unconditional medical coverage, as recommended in the Report of the Academy of Medicine of 26 February 2020 [2] . These provisions must include prostitutes, particularly non-French-speaking ones, on the fringes of the public or even associative system. Foreigners must benefit from the maintenance of their right to plead for their stay in France while the ad hoc bodies (prefectures, French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons, and National Right Asylum Court) are closed.",
