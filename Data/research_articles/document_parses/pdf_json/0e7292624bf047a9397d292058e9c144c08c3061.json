            "text": "The pandemic of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) is a highly contagious respiratory disease resulting from a life-threatening novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Since its outbreak in December 2019, it has reported causing 837,104 infections, 41,249 deaths worldwide, and quickly spread out to over 190 countries [1] [2] [3] . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positivesense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. In the last two decades, two viruses from the same family, SARS-CoV in 2002 to 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, have also caused two out of four outbreaks in the 21st century, and the other two are influenza virus H1N1 in 2009 and Ebola in 2014 [4] . Two drugs, Remdesvir and Chloroquine, developed for treating Ebola virus and Malaria, respectively, have been approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19 as Emergency Use Authorization, although no formal clinical trial has been finished [5, 6] . So far, there is no effective vaccine for COVID-19. Several vaccines are in the process or clinical trail [7] . Recent advancements in mRNA vaccines, mRNA-1273, targeting the Spike protein of the coronavirus, has started for SAEs-CoV-2 patients in Phase 1 clinical trial. However, from lessons learned from antiinfluenzas virus therapy in the past, we believe that therapeutics targeting the host-virus interactions could potentially present more effective and broad-spectrum treatment modalities for COVID-19. The strategy of targeting host factors is arguably less mutational resistance with more broad anti-virus spectrum potential,.",

            "text": "In the past, the therapeutic strategy for anti-microbial pathogens primarily targets pathogen genes and proteins. This strategy works well for anti-bacterial in most of the cases. Still, it has much less success in antiviruses' therapy as the viral genes have the intrinsic nature to mutate very frequently to become resistant to vaccine and drugs due to the less error correction activity of their nucleotide polymerases in virus replication, as well as multiple sub-families with small different target genes. Although the flu vaccines have been widely distributed, it is estimated that the efficacy of flu vaccines against both influenza A and B viruses is estimated to be 40% [8] . On the other hand, viruses can become resistant to antiviral drugs. In the US, three neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) are recommended by the CDC: oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. Most of the recently circulating influenza viruses have been susceptible to the NAI antiviral medications, but recent virus isolates from patients show significant drug resistance, even in the same year of the drug lauched [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . There is another class of influenza antiviral drugs (amantadine and rimantadine) that are not recommended for use in the US because about half flu A viruses are resistant to these drugs and they are not effective against influenza B virus. Besides, the antiviral agents must be used within 48 h of the onset of influenza symptoms to be effective. But most of the time, when severe symptoms occur, it already passes the timeline and is at a very late stage. As a consequence of the current anti-influenza virus strategy, although broad vaccines and drugs targeting virus proteins have been developed in the last decade, the influenza virus is still a highly life-threatening disease.

            "text": "New strategies to control emerging viruses, including their drugresistant mutants, such as SARS-CoV-2, are utmost needed. A new approach of targeting host factors for anti-pathogens emerged recently [15] . We have been working on this topic for more than a decade, mainly focusing on SUMOylation and other Ubiquitylation-like pathways because they both regulate cytokine signaling and viral proteins stabilities [16] [17] [18] [19] . Discovery and characterization of cellular factors or pathways that are critical for pathogen life cycle in a host or regulate pathogenesis hold great promise for revealing new strategies for anti-infections. There may be several benefits by targeting host factors. First, the viral genomes, particularly ssRNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 virus and Hepatitis C virus (HCV), have a very high mutation rate (10 \u22123 -10 \u22126 substitutions/bp/cell infection) mainly due to the lack of proofreading activities of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP), RNA-dependent DNA Polymerase (RdDP) or Reverse Transcriptase (RTase), and other cellular enzymes that modify the nucleotides, although a recent study shows that SARS-CoV open reading frame 14 (nsp14) may encode a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity (exoN) [20] [21] [22] . In contrast, viral hosts are most multicellular organisms, including human, and mutation rate of DNA polymerases are much lower (10 \u22129 -10 \u221210 substitutions/bp/cell division), mostly due to both proofreading activity of DNA polymerase and mismatch repair pathways of host cells [20, 21] . Second, targeting host factors may have a broader anti-virus spectrum. For example, both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use Ace2 as their receptors to enter cells, and if any agents that can block the virus-Ace2 interaction may be effective for both viruses. Third, both COVID-19 and SARS have cytokine storms resulting in severe pneumonia, causing the death of patients. The control of the cytokine storm is also a very desirable treatment approach for patients in serious conditions for virus infectioninduced pneumonia, such as COVID-19.",

NTZ depletes ATP-sensitive intracellular Ca 2+ stores as well as alteration of viral protein N-linked glycosylation and trafficking [24] . The long-term ef-ficacy and potential side effect(s) need to be evaluated in the future.
