            "text": "As in the esophagus, most diseases in the stomach are in fl ammatory (infectious) or neoplastic. Not discussed here are congenital diseases and hernias. In fl ammatory diseases (various forms of gastritis) may follow circulatory changes, autoimmune disorders, or infection (e.g., Helicobacter pylori gastritis). Shown here are congestive gastritis following severe right heart failure, erosive gastritis in Helicobacter infection, pseudomembranous gastritis in agranulocytosis, various kinds of gastric ulcers, and gastritis in autoimmune disease (e.g., scleroderma). Most important are the various presentations of gastric neoplasias, including adenocarcinoma and primary malignant lymphoma. Acute and chronic gastritis differ both etiologically and morphologically. Among their causes are infection (e.g., H. pylori ), chemical injury (aspirin, nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs [NSAIDs], alcohol, steroids), autoimmunity, and circulatory changes (stress, sepsis, shock). Acute gastritis is commonly erosive, hemorrhagic, or both, whereas chronic gastritis ranges from a mild, super fi cial form or lymphocytic gastritis with autoantibodies (autoimmune gastritis in pernicious anemia) to severe, atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia and increased risk of gastric cancer. Peptic ulcer disease refers to mucosal ulcerations in the stomach and duodenum resulting from various causes, such as gastritis related to consumption of alcohol, aspirin, and NSAIDs. It appears that psychic and genetic in fl uences in these patients are responsible for excessive gastric secretions of hydrochloric acid and peptic enzymes. Shown here is a typical, sharply de fi ned gastric ulcer located in the \"magenstrasse\" (the major route of food transport in the lesser curvature). More common are peptic ulcers in the upper duodenum and pyloric area [ 2 ] . More details of their diagnosis, classi fi cation, clinical features, and prognosis may be found in major textbooks of pathology and clinical specialties. Fig. 4 .33 Hemorrhagic infarction. Sudden occlusion of a large artery by embolism or thrombosis leads to hemorrhagic infarction. Less frequently, hemorrhagic infarction may be caused by autoimmune arteritis. Thrombosis of mesenteric veins causes ischemia without overt infarction because of good collateral blood fl ow, unless small veins are also occluded. The fi gure shows a typical hemorrhagic infarction of the small intestine. Note the segmental hyperemia with subsequent segmental hemorrhagic enteritis and necrosis. Microscopy shows hyperemia, edema, mucosal hemorrhage, and eventual necrosis. Muscular dysfunction will cause ileus and subsequent peritonitis and shock In severe cases, more extensive mucosal damage will cause pseudomembranous enteritis. Other common infectious organisms causing this type of enteritis are Yersinia , Campylobacter species, and the more toxic Clostridium perfringens Fig. 4 .44 Crohn's disease. Enteritis regionalis (Crohn's disease) is a chronic in fl ammatory disease preferentially of the small bowel. Its cause is not known, but its pathogenesis is thought to be infectiousautoimmune. Crohn's disease starts with edematous thickening of the intestinal wall, lymphoid in fi ltrates, and focal granulomas and fi stulas progressing to mucosal atrophy, fi brosis, and eventual perforation and peri-intestinal mesenteric in fl ammation. There is prominent regional lymphadenopathy.

            "text": "Ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, recurrent ulcerative disease of the large intestine. Although it is idiopathic, its pathogenesis appears to include several factors, such as genetic predisposition, infection, and autoimmunity. It is occasionally associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, erythema nodosum, systemic vasculitis, and uveitis. Tests for autoantibodies (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) are frequently positive in ulcerative colitis. The disease usually starts with a yellowish exudate and hyperemia of the proctosigmoid mucosa and the left-sided colon, but it may extend to involve the entire colon (pancolitis). Ulcerative colitis progresses with recurrent attacks and the formation of extensive, coalescent ulcerations with islands of intact mucosa in between. Fulminant cases may show features of toxic megacolon (see Fig. 4 .71 ). Radiologic features are shown in Fig. 4 .64 . This fi gure and Fig. 4 .75 show typical gross pathologic changes of ulcerative colitis in the colon, with segmental severe in fl ammation with con fl uent ulcerations The clinical term polyp consists of various pathologic entities, essentially of reactive lesions and of neoplastic growths. Reactive types are hyperplastic, in fl ammatory, hamartomatous, and juvenile polyps. Neoplastic polyps are known in pathology as adenomas (adenomatous polyps) or polypoid carcinomas. Adenomas are subclassi fi ed according to their proliferative activity and their structure as tubular adenomas, villous adenomas, and mixed tubulovillous adenomas. The risk of malignant transformation to carcinoma rises with the prolifera-tive activity, that is, from tubular to villous adenoma. This pedunculated tubular adenoma of the large intestine ( a ) was removed by endoscopy. Microscopy shows proliferation of nonatypical tubular glands ( b , c ), resulting in classi fi cation as an adenomatous polyp-that is, a tubular adenoma (benign). In a villous adenoma ( d , e ), the gross surface would not be smooth but would look velvety; microscopy shows an irregular, fi ne villous surface with a hyperplastic and often dysplastic epithelium Transformation into adenocarcinoma is a stepwise process from usually benign precursor lesions, involving the altered activation of proto-oncogenes and repressor genes as well as defective repair mechanisms. Grossly, adenocarcinoma of the colon is classi fi ed as polypoid, ulcerative, or in fi ltrative. The prognosis depends on the spread of the tumor through the colonic wall and metastases into lymph nodes and more distant organs (especially the liver). Shown in this fi gure is a common ulcerated, primary adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum. Note the elevated fi rm wall with immobile mucosa surrounding an irregular and partially bloody ulcer focal, constrictive lesion of the colon producing a circumferential \"apple core\" deformity in the sigmoid colon ",

Dieulafoy's ulcer is a mucosal, hemorrhagic ulceration on top of an aneurysm-like dilatation of a tortuous arteriole or small artery. It is usually located in the stomach but rarely may be found in other parts of the intestines. Ulcerative in fl ammation will cause erosion of the vessel, and sudden hemorrhage brings the patient to medical attention.

In the United States alone, some 76 million illnesses per year are caused by infectious food poisoning, with 325,000 hospital admissions and 5,000 deaths [ 1 ] . Several representative pictures of infectious enterocolitis are shown in this chapter. Similar to other organ sites, infections with certain organisms, such as fungi ( Candida ), and certain viruses (HCMV) suggest an underlying immune de fi ciency of the af fl icted patient. Other in fl ammatory bowel diseases are of autoimmune etiology and may include systemic reactions such as ileitis terminalis (Crohn's disease) and ulcerative colitis. Diverticulosis and diverticulitis are rather nonspeci fi c, yet may suggest a genetic susceptibility. In addition, several examples depict common diseases in which the intestines are involved secondarily: colitis in uremia, enterocolitis in hemorrhagic-uremic syndrome, and vascular thrombotic or thromboembolic diseases. Many of the in fl ammatory diseases are accompanied by peritonitis, with peritoneal adhesions in their chronic forms. Neoplastic diseases of the small bowel are rare, accounting for less than 5 % of gastrointestinal tumors. Benign tumors include polyps (e.g., in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) and adenomas, lipomas, and leiomyomas. Malignant tumors include adenocarcinoma, malignant lymphoma, carcinoid tumors, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Finally, benign and malignant tumors of the bowel (most often of the large intestine) are among the most common. Among the large variety presented here in their typical forms are intestinal polyps (adenomas), carcinomas, and carcinoids. Adenocarcinomas of the colon account for about 15 % of all cancer deaths in the United States, with about 150,000 new cancers arising every year",

Note the yellow-white submucosal nodule in the upper center of the specimen. Carcinoids are tumors of the neuroendocrine system and usually secrete neuropeptides (frequently serotonin, causing carcinoid syndrome). Besides the gastrointestinal tract (more commonly in the ileum and appendix), carcinoid tumors may arise in other locations, such as the pancreas, bronchus, liver and gallbladder, ovary, or testis. They are often multicentric and may be part of a familial multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome. Several types of MEN also involve the parathyroid (adenoma, carcinoma), thyroid (medullary carcinoma), adrenal (pheochromocytoma; see Chap. 11 ), and other glands. Carcinoid tumors are potentially malignant (size above 1 cm) and can metastasize.

Diverticular disease (diverticulosis without in fl ammation; diverticulitis with in fl ammation) refers to a herniation of mucosa and submucosa through the muscularis in the large intestine. It is common in adults beyond the age of 50 and is usually located in the sigmoid and descendent colon. Besides a familial predisposition, the pathogenesis includes a weakness (defect) in the colonic wall at sites of nutrient vessel entrance, increased intraluminal pressure, and dietary factors (low fi ber with high carbohydrates; certain spices, such as garlic).

Note edematous swelling of the mucosa with multiple petechial hemorrhages corresponding to microscopic septic endotheliitis of small vessels. Similar changes are seen in the skin. A serious complication of meningococcal sepsis is adrenal cortical hemorrhage and necrosis (see Chap. 11 ) Fig. 4.67 Pseudomembranous colitis following prolonged antibiotic treatment, with alterations of the intestinal fl ora and overgrowth of Clostridium dif fi cile organisms.The most common site is the rectosigmoid. Note mucosal hyperemia and typical small, fungiform pseudomembranes scattered throughout the mucosa 68 Uremic colitis. Uremic colitis is a chemically induced in fl ammation in patients with renal failure and uremia. Toxic substances normally removed by the kidneys are eliminated through secondary excretory mechanisms in mucosa and serosal membranes. By accumulation, these toxins induce chemical in fl ammation (e.g., serous pleuritis and pericarditis, sero fi brinous pneumonitis). These fi gures show the early phase with edema and hemorrhage ( a ) and a later phase with pseudomembranous colitis ( b ), in which the foci are larger and more irregular than in postantibiotic colitis a bFig. 4.69Amebic colitis. Amebic infestation (amebiasis) is caused by Entamoeba histolytica invasion of the large intestine, which may spread to the liver and produce amebic abscess. Humans are the sole reservoir, so the disease is acquired by ingestion of foods contaminated by human feces. Amebic colitis starts with asymptomatic colonization followed in about 8 days by scattered necroses and ulceration. These lesions show a typical undermining pattern and contain many amebae in the necrotic debris. Liquid stools and bloody mucus contain many organisms and permit the clinical diagnosis. Shown here is an amebic ulcer of the rectum ( a ). Microscopy from the ulcer shows many amebic trophozoites ( b )Fig. 4.70 Endoscopic view of cytomegalovirus colitis.
