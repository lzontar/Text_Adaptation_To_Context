The ACE then converts angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2, which in turn binds to the angiotensin receptor, upregulating the levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1). This results in a widespread inflammatory response with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins [1, 2] . The large-scale unregulated production of interleukins, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), stimulates several downstream pathways, increasing the production of acute-phase reactants like C-reactive protein (CRP), and increases mobilization of neutrophils [3] .
