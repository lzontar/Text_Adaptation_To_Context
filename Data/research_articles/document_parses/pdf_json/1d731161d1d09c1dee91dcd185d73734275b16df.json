Therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated in vivo; thus, patient management relies exclusively on supportive care, which, given the high case-fatality rate, is not highly effective. The rhesus macaque is the only known model organism for MERS-CoV infection, developing an acute localized to widespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease 2,3 that recapitulates mild to moderate human MERS-CoV cases 4,5 . The combination of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro 6 ; therefore, we initiated this treatment 8 h after inoculation of rhesus macaques. In contrast to untreated, infected macaques, treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no or very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moreover, treated animals showed lower levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers, in addition to fewer viral genome copies, distinct gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response and improves clinical outcome. As these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic for other infections, IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin should be considered for the management of MERS-CoV cases.",

Similar to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infection, MERS-CoV infection can result in an acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan dysfunction 8 . The rapid identification of therapeutics for MERS-CoV is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine. A meta-analysis of data from the SARS outbreak in 2003 9 found that the benefit of different treatment strategies 10-18 was inconclusive at best 9 . We recently demonstrated in vitro that the antiviral effect of interferon-a2b (IFN-a2b) against MERS-CoV is augmented by the concomitant use of ribavirin, and when we combined the treatments, the effective concentrations were such that they could be used in the clinic 6 . Here we evaluate the effectiveness in vivo of combination IFN-a2b and ribavirin treatment, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that can be immediately implemented in the clinic for MERS-CoV cases.",

We initiated treatment 8 h after infection, with subcutaneous delivery of 5 mega international units (MIU)/kg of IFN-a2b and an intravenous loading dose of ribavirin (30 mg per kg body weight). We subsequently treated the rhesus macaques with ribavirin intramuscularly (10 mg per kg body weight) every 8 h and IFN-a2b (5 MIU/kg) subcutaneously every 16 h until 72 h after infection, when all animals were euthanized (Fig. 1a) at the peak of clinical signs and viral loads in this model 2,3 .",

We observed significantly increased white blood cell counts in untreated animals 1 d after infection, but they returned to normal levels on subsequent days (Fig. 1d) . We attributed the increase in white blood cells mainly to a significant increase in neutrophils (Fig. 1e) . In contrast, treated animals did not show evidence of increased respiration, piloerection or decreased oxygen saturation levels, nor did they show significant changes in hematology (Fig. 1d,e) .

The rhesus macaque is the only known model organism for MERS-CoV infection, developing an acute localized to widespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease 2,3 that recapitulates mild to moderate human MERS-CoV cases 4, 5 . The combination of interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro 6 ; therefore, we initiated this treatment 8 h after inoculation of rhesus macaques. In contrast to untreated, infected macaques, treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no or very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moreover, treated animals showed lower levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers, in addition to fewer viral genome copies, distinct gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response and improves clinical outcome. As these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic for other infections, IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin should be considered for the management of MERS-CoV cases.",

Similar to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infection, MERS-CoV infection can result in an acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan dysfunction 8 . The rapid identification of therapeutics for MERS-CoV is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine. A meta-analysis of data from the SARS outbreak in 2003 9 found that the benefit of different treatment strategies [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] was inconclusive at best 9 . We recently demonstrated in vitro that the antiviral effect of interferon-a2b (IFN-a2b) against MERS-CoV is augmented by the concomitant use of ribavirin, and when we combined the treatments, the effective concentrations were such that they could be used in the clinic 6 . Here we evaluate the effectiveness in vivo of combination IFN-a2b and ribavirin treatment, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that can be immediately implemented in the clinic for MERS-CoV cases.",

The animals' observed breathing difficulties were supported by evidence of decreased oxygen saturation in untreated animals (2-5% decrease from baseline) (Fig. 1c) . We observed significantly increased white blood cell counts in untreated animals 1 d after infection, but they returned to normal levels on subsequent days (Fig. 1d) . We attributed the increase in white blood cells mainly to a significant increase in neutrophils (Fig. 1e) . In contrast, treated animals did not show evidence of increased respiration, piloerection or decreased oxygen saturation levels, nor did they show significant changes in hematology (Fig. 1d,e) . To monitor signs of pneumonia, we X-rayed the animals daily. Radiographs from treated animals remained normal 1 d after infection and showed, at most, light in treated animals, all respiratory tract tissues collected at necropsy were positive for MERS-CoV by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3b) . Viral RNA was also absent from the tonsils, spleen and kidney of treated animals, but it was present in these tissues in two of three untreated animals. In all of the tissues analyzed, with the exception of left middle lobe lung specimens, the viral loads were lower in specimens from treated animals as compared to untreated animals (Fig. 3b) . When we combined the values from all lung specimens, the mean viral load in treated animals was 0.81 log lower than in untreated animals (P = 0.0428, unpaired t-test, one tail), demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in virus replication throughout the lung (Fig. 3b, inset) .",

By examining the 205 DEGs identified using a more stringent P value cutoff (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 5) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified many genes that were downregulated in untreated animals. Many of these were associated with hedgehog signaling (Fig. 4c) , a pathway involved in respiratory morphogenesis and vascularization [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and potentially involved in inflammatory injury 28 . In treated animals, we observed upregulation of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and subsequent downregulation of genes associated with cell proliferation (Supplementary Table 5) . SHH, the priming protein of the hedgehog pathway, and the associated molecule GLI family zinc finger 1 have been shown to block injurious responses in the pulmonary vasculature induced by multiple types of inflammatory and stress stimuli [29] [30] [31] [32] . Consistent with the reduced inflammation, reduction in cellular infiltrates and lack of perivasculitis in the lungs of treated animals, the upregulation of SHH suggests that the hedgehog pathway may regulate the host response to protect the lung from potentially injurious inflammation.",

In addition, treated animals showed reduced systemic and local levels of proinflammatory markers. Lung tissues collected from treated animals 3 d after infection showed a significant reduction in viral genome copies, an absence of gross lesions and less severe histopathological changes compared to untreated animals. Microarray analysis of the lung supported the success of treatment and identified the hedgehog signaling pathway as a putative contributor to decreased lung damage. These data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques with IFN-a2b and ribavirin improves outcome of infection. IFN-a2b and ribavirin treatment would be expected to provide the greatest benefit early in infection; however, the prolonged disease course in humans 8, 33 suggests that the treatment window may be considerably wider in the clinic. The disease severity in the rhesus macaque model, which seems most similar to mild to moderate human MERS-CoV cases, makes it difficult to extrapolate the outcome of this treatment in severe cases in humans. Thus, it is currently unknown whether initiation of treatment upon progression to severe respiratory illness would have any benefit, a situation faced in many acute infectious diseases. Additional therapeutics should be evaluated; however, given the severity and poor outcome of MERS-CoV infection, combined IFN-a2b and ribavirin therapy should be considered as an early intervention therapy for MERS-CoV.",

We inoculated six healthy rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), aged 4-6 years, with a total of 7 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV by combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes as previously established 2,3,35 . Animals were randomly assigned to either the treated (two males, one female) or untreated (two females, one male) group in a nonblinded manner.Treatment. Treatment was initiated at 8 h after infection. The initial ribavirin (MP Bioscience) loading dose (30 mg per kg body weight) was delivered intravenously; subsequent doses (10 mg per kg body weight) were delivered every 8 h intramuscularly. Human interferon-a2b, as IntronA (Merck) (5 MIU/kg) was delivered subcutaneously every 16 h. Three animals received IFN-a2b and ribavirin (treated), whereas three animals received sham treatment (untreated) by the same routes with a comparable volume per kg body weight of sterile saline. The animals were monitored three times daily through clinical scoring and/or examinations as described previously 34 . Clinical examinations included daily ventral-dorsal and lateral X-rays, evaluations of body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate, pulse oximetry, venous bleeding, bronchoalveolar lavage and collection of swabs from nasal and oral mucosa. A board-certified veterinarian interpreted the radiographic data. On day 3 after infection, all animals were necropsied, and conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, tonsil, oronasopharynx, mandibular lymph node, salivary gland, trachea, right bronchus, left bronchus, all six lung lobes, mediastinal lymph node, inguinal lymph node, axillary lymph node, mesenteric lymph node heart, liver, spleen, kidney and urinary bladder were collected for virological and histopathological assays.Hematology assays. Hematological analysis was carried out following standard protocols. The total white blood cell, lymphocyte, platelet, reticulocyte and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit values, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were determined from EDTA blood with the HemaVet 950FS+ laser-based hematology analyzer (Drew Scientific).",
