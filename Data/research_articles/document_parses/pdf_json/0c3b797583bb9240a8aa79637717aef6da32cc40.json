She subsequently developed fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and malaise (Table 1) . Her physical examination was notable for diffuse wheezing and bilateral crackles in the lower lung bases. Over the course of the first day of hospitalization, she became hypoxic, with oxygen saturations ranging between 80% and 90% despite 100% FIO 2 via a high-flow nasal cannula. She then became hemodynamically unstable with a blood pressure of 87/62 mm Hg, tachycardia to 104 bpm, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 44, and a maximum temperature of 103.1\u00b0F. Laboratory findings at that time revealed a white blood cell count of 7.7 3 10 3 /mL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 84 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 38 U/L, albumin of 3.3 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase of 398 U/L, D-dimer 1,091 ng/mL, and ferritin 1,332 ng/mL. Blood and urine cultures were negative. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 by nucleic acid amplification. Thoracic x-ray revealed multifocal bilateral airspace opacities with right lower lung atelectasis ( Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "The incidence of liver disease in patients with COVID-19 has been reported to range from 14.8% to 53% of patients. 11 Patients with hepatic insult have elevated liver biochemistries including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and low levels of albumin. 11 Liver injury and low albumin are associated with more severe disease and poor outcomes. 11 Age, lymphopenia, and C-reactive protein levels are independent risk factors for hepatic insult. 12 Liver enzyme abnormalities may be more common in COVID-19 than in non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. 13 Fan et al reported 50% of patients to have abnormal liver function tests on admission and prolonged hospital stay. 14 Although bats are known as the primary reservoir of the virus, intermediate species such as monkeys, snakes, or cats can be vectors for transmission to humans. The virus can bind directly to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor located on respiratory cells as well as gastric, duodenal, liver, and biliary epithelial cells. Injury may be mediated by upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor expression in these cells leading to a direct viral attack on GI tissue. 15 There is evidence that the initial SARS virus and SARS-COV-2 are detected in stool specimens supporting the GI tropism of this virus and a possible fecal-oral transmission. 16 Studies have found degeneration and necrosis of GI mucosa with histological findings of lymphocytic infiltrates and abundant infiltrating plasma cells. 16 Liver injury may involve gene dysregulation of tight junction formation and bile acid transport impairing the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes. 15 In addition, immune-mediated inflammation, cytokine storm syndrome, and drug hepatotoxicity may contribute to GI and liver injury. 11 The influence of SARS-CoV-2 on chronic liver diseases has yet to be studied. Further research studies are needed on better understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of GI disease in these patients. We present a patient with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea before developing fever and acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that GI manifestations are common as a part of the disease process. Further studies are needed to better understand the digestive symptoms of COVID-19 and the prevalence of liver disease. ",
