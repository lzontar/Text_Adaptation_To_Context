Chloroquine is now only used for malaria therapy in less developed countries or as a comparator for preclinical testing [1] . Although it has lost its preeminent position in malaria therapy, there is ample clinical evidence that chloroquine, and its derivative hydroxychloroquine, are effective for the treatment of lupus erythematosus, even during pregnancy. Chloroquine and its analogs have also been shown to modify cell differentiation and induce apoptosis in different cancer cell lines, giving hope that they will prove useful adjuncts to cancer chemotherapy [2] . As an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine co-medication strongly enhanced in vitro tumor proliferation rate of docetaxel-loaded PEG-b-PLGA micelles [3] , and it also played as a chemical sensitizer in doxorubicin and chloroquine coencapsulated liposomes [4] . Chloroquine gels have been developed as microbicides against HIV-1 infection and exerted a dose-dependent anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro [5] .

A structural analog instead of deuterated isotope internal standard (IS) and a simple protein precipitation by methanol were employed in this study. A traditional reversed-phase C18 (RP18) column was combined with regular mobile phase containing methanol-water (75:25, v/v, 2.5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.6). The analysis method for chloroquine was quick, simple and sensitive. However, the absolute recovery of the one-step protein precipitation extraction was unusually rather low (\u223c19%), which could be related to the matrix effect (not discussed in the assay) since chloroquine could be eluted along with matrixes in the form of salt in current column and mobile phase system. Generally, a traditional RP18 column was hard to reserve solar or basic compounds such as chloroquine. Most of the aforementioned methods used gradient elution [9, 13] or relatively high proportion of aqueous phase [8, [10] [11] [12] to retain the analytes. Still, these methods have obvious drawbacks, including a requirement of large injection volumes (up to 100 \u03bcl), long analysis times (especially combined with gradient elution), low sensitivity and limited selectivity, and therefore make it not suitable for fast and robust detection. HILIC was first introduced by Alpert in 1990 [15] and is an attractive complementary tool for the analysis of small polar/ionic compounds. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions exploited in traditional RP chromatography, HILIC takes advantage of polar partitioning, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange interactions and weak electrostatic interactions, making it especially suitable for the retention and separation of polar compounds [16] . Compared with traditional RP columns, HILIC columns show better retention and more symmetrical peak shapes for basic and polar compounds. HILIC on polar stationary phases typically uses an organic-rich solvent containing 5-40% future science group HILIC-MS/MS analysis of chloroquine in miniature pig plasma Methodology Lejeune [9] Deng [8] Samanidou [7] Yonemitsu [11] Bisdemethyled derivative of cycloguanil water as the mobile phase, which enhances MS sensitivity. Because of their versatility, HILIC separations have recently gained popularity for the analysis of polar drugs in complex sample matrices [17] . Chloroquine contains a highly polar tertiary amine that is likely to interact with silanol groups present in the stationary phase of traditional RP columns, usually resulting in poor peak shapes. In almost all published chromatography methods, strong ion-pairing reagents are added to the mobile phase in order to inhibit secondary retention [8, 10, 11, 13] , but these buffer salts could cause problems by crystallizing in the desolvation process during MS detection. Since ion-pairing reagents are not required in HILIC [18] , HILIC coupled with MS could be an especially suitable tool for analysis of chloroquine.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 8, "end": 12, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 30, "end": 34, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 44, "end": 48, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 113, "end": 117, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1057, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1061, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1112, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1117, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1122, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1127, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1481, "end": 1485, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1875, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2209, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2215, "end": 2218, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2229, "end": 2232, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2247, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2485, "end": 2489, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2834, "end": 2837, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2838, "end": 2841, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2842, "end": 2845, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2846, "end": 2849, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 3014, "end": 3018, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Our assay"}, {"text": "In the present study, we have developed a rapid procedure, using high-performance HILIC and a one-step method of sample purification by precipitation using acetonitrile, for the determination of concentration of chloroquine in the plasma of miniature pigs.

With additives of 5 mM ammonium formate and formic acid (0.015\u223c0.1% formic acid) in mobile phase system consisting of acetonitrile and water, chloroquine did not reserve on an Eclipse Plus C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Agilent, USA) and the retention time remained almost unchanged (\u223c1.8 min) with different proportion of acetonitrile ranged between 13 and 70%.

A high proportion of organic solvent containing acetonitrile (\u223c60%), methanol (\u223c30%) and 0.1% formic acid (\u223c10%) gave a comparatively well-shaped peak (half peak width 0.6 min, still broad) on the Agilent XDB column (retention time of 3.25 min) but this still did not meet our requirements. In conclusion, all analytes showed weak retention on these RP columns, regardless of solvent composition, confirming that traditional RP columns are not able to adequately retain chloroquine and that secondary retention was likely to have occurred between analytes and columns.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 77, "end": 81, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 338, "end": 341, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 342, "end": 345, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 346, "end": 349, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 350, "end": 354, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 355, "end": 359, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 360, "end": 364, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 365, "end": 369, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2268, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2269, "end": 2272, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2273, "end": 2276, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2277, "end": 2280, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 54, "end": 72, "text": "(Figure 1, pK a 10", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "LC-MS method development"}, {"text": "In many of the published RPLC methods, a strong base such as triethylamine [13, 21] or diethylamine [10] was added to competitively conjugate with silanol groups on the stationary phase and thus reduced the binding of amine groups in the analytes with the stationary phase. This procedure, however, remains controversial since it irreversibly changes the character of the column and an alkaline mobile phase is needed to elute the analytes. Some researchers have inhibited secondary retention by increasing the ionic strength of the mobile phase by adding reagents such as perchloric acid [12] , phosphoric acid [11] or phosphate buffer [13] . Although this method can be successful with some detection methods, it is not recommended for LC-MS/MS because nonvolatile acids and buffer salts could crystallize during the desolvation procedure and damage the mass spectrometer. In the present study, we tried to optimize the mobile phase and column for LC-MS/MS, and to identify conditions suitable for high-throughput detection. As the proportion of formic acid in the mobile phase was increased to 0.2%, the peak shapes showed some improvement since basic analytes tended to form salts at lower pH and showed less interaction with the stationary phase. High concentrations of formic acid could improve the peak shape, however, coelution of matrix and solvent interfere with detection of the analytes and we chose to use a more polar column to retain chloroquine and other basic analytes as salts. HILIC provides an alternative to HPLC for separating polar compound [17] . As with ion chromatography, for basic compounds such as chloroquine, HILIC gives good peak shapes (no tailing) and reasonable retention times compared with traditional RP columns [22] .

We employed a compromised flow rate of 0.5 ml/min here and tried to balance the retention and signal response by adjusting mobile phase component. The retention time of chloroquine on underivatized HILIC columns was longer when the mobile phase contained a higher proportion of organic solvent.
