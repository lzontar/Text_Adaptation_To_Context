Fever, cough, and shortness of breath 211 are the most common symptoms in NCPP, but these symptoms are also reported in IP 212 and use of symptom has very limited value in distinguishing NCPP from IP. Bilateral 213 pneumonia and ground-glass opacity were the typical imaging findings of NCPP, but 214 these imaging features are also common in IP (Shi et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). At 215 present, the differentiation between NCPP and IP is mainly according to specific 216 nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, whereas false negative 217 results could be existed in clinical practice. Thus, a further investigation of the 218 method which can be used to differentiate between NCCP and IP is still needed. 219 220 The comparison of laboratory test results between patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 221 and those infected with influenza virus was rarely investigated. To the best of our 222 knowledge, we present for the first time a large-scale clinical evaluation for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 participants. Besides, our model is the first model which is constructed based on 227 combination of routine laboratory tests. It is undeniable that the diagnostic model 228 shows a moderate value in differential diagnosis between NCPP and IP. However, we 229 thought that this model could serve as a complement to other approaches including 230 computed tomography and molecular tests, especially in some resource-limited areas. 231 232 There are some implications when we compared the laboratory routine tests between 233 NCPP and IP. In general, the difference of laboratory indexes between adult patients 234 with SARS-CoV-2 infection and those with influenza virus infection is not very 235 obvious, which means that there may be some common reaction mechanism in the 236 body's response to these two kinds of viruses. However, we still found some 237 indicators that were quite different between NCPP and IP. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 238 infection had a greater reduction in the number of white blood cells, especially in the 239 number of neutrophils, compared with patients with influenza virus infection. This is 240 inconsistent with previous studies showing that the decrease of lymphocytes is one of 241 typical characteristics of laboratory results in NCPP (Huang et al., 2020, Chen et al., 242 2020). Actually, the number of lymphocytes was also decreased in IP (most values 243 were below the lower limit of the normal range). Thus, based on the decrease of 244 lymphocytes, the patients maybe misdiagnosed as NCP during the outbreak of 245 COVID-19 when the patients had influenza virus infection. Our results suggest that 246 the patients have decreased numbers of both lymphocytes and neutrophils may be 247 more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.248 An evaluation version of novaPDF was used to create this PDF file.

This 252 suggests that we should pay more attention to the immune status of the NCPP and that 253 immune status monitoring may be helpful for differential diagnosis between patients 254 with SARS-CoV-2 infection and those with influenza virus infection. But surprisingly, 255 higher levels of RBC and TP were observed in NCPP compared with in IP, which 256 indicated that the nutritional status of NCPP may be better than IP. However, higher 257 levels of ALT, AST, IBILI, LDH, CREA and UR were also observed in NCPP patients 258 compared with IP, which indicated that the impairment of liver and kidney function 259 may be more common in NCPP. We also observed that NCPP had higher levels of 260 magnesium, potassium, sodium and HCO3 than IP, which indicated that the disorders 261 of electrolytes and acid-base balance are more common in NCPP. Furthermore, higher 262 levels of APTT and FIB in NCPP may indicate that NCPP had a higher risk of 263 developing blood clots than IP, suggesting that more attention should be paid to 264 coagulation in the treatment and care of NCPP. In all, these data suggest that the 265 disturbance of internal environment is one of the important characteristics of NCPP. A 266 further study in other areas such as imaging and histopathology is necessary, which 267 could help us to achieve a clearer distinction between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza 268 virus infection in clinical practice. 269 270 An evaluation version of novaPDF was used to create this PDF file.

First, this study does not include children, but 271 the improvement of differential diagnosis between NCPP and IP in children is also 272 urgently needed. Second, the performance of the diagnostic model in distinguishing 273 NCPP from IP is preliminary. Further validation in multiple centers with a large 274 sample size is required. 275 276 In conclusion, we have identified a diagnostic model by incorporating blood routine 277 examination, biochemical indicators, and coagulation function, which is proved to 278 have moderate performance in discriminating NCPP from IP. This model might serve 279 as a useful adjunct to radiological and molecular methods in distinguishing NCPP 280 from IP in clinical practice. Furthermore, these observations are relevant to guide 281 further development of strategies for treatment and prognosis of both NCPP and IP.

Meanwhile, influenza is close mimics of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and usually cause similar respiratory symptoms (Paules and Subbarao, 2017). Although most influenza patients (IP) are children, there is a certain percentage of adult who can be infected with influenza, especially in winter and spring (Uyeki, 2017). It is difficult to differentiate IP from NCP patients (NCPP) in some cases due to their non-specific and indistinguishable symptoms. While prompt diagnosis and patient isolation are the hallmarks for initial control of the new epidemic, the more specific and classified laboratory characteristics of NCPP still require further investigation.In this study, we systematically investigated the laboratory characteristics of adult patients who were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and those with influenza virus infection.
