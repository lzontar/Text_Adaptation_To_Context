            "text": "droplets, the recommended PPE for healthcare workers has been for airborne precautions 85 when possible.[9,10] Airborne precautions are designed to reduce transmission of small 86 respirable particles and prevent dispersion over long distances through placement of the 87 patient in a single patient AIIR, use of an N95 or higher-level respirator during direct 88 patient contact, and limited transportation of the patient with adherence to precautions 89 during necessary transport.[1, 2, 4, 5, 7] When transportation is required within the 90 healthcare facility, or placement is needed in a single patient room not equipped as an 91 AIIR, source control can be achieved by the patient wearing a mask.[1] 92 Recommended precautions for orthopaedic teams specific to COVID-19 93 In response to COVID-19, different healthcare centers have implemented a 94 variety of often evolving policies for healthcare personnel PPE. This is a highly charged 95 and emotional issue for which there is a dearth of high-level evidence. The variables to be 96 considered include protection of patients and healthcare providers, accuracy and 97 availability of testing, and responsible use of PPE resources. 98 the pandemic.[12, 13] Ideally, this operating room should be separate from the main OR complex with minimal traffic flow. Rodrigues-Pinto and colleagues outline a five zone 107 COVID-19 operating room.[14] Additional staffing and transportation work-flows can 108 also be implemented.[15] The untested, symptomatic, presumed COVID-19 positive 109 patient requiring surgery, in the authors' opinion, should be treated as if confirmed 110 positive. 111 Preoperatively, the patient should be masked and ideally all providers wear N95 112 respirators. The N95 mask, when consistently and properly worn, is effective against 113 airborne particles. A recent study of orthopaedic surgeons from Wuhan, China reported 114 that not wearing an N95 respirator mask was a significant risk factor for the development 115 of COVID-19 (OR, 5.20[95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]).[16] When there is 116 a shortage of N95 respirators, the CDC recommends prioritizing N95 respirators for 117 aerosol producing procedures.[17] It is the authors' recommendation that if source 118 control is lost because the patient cannot wear a mask, providers should wear an N95 119 respirator. 120Once the patient reaches the operating room, however, the COVID-19 patient will 121 need airway management with removal of any mask leading to contamination of the 122 room for all personnel, not just anesthesia providers. The presence in the operating room 123 of only essential staff during endotracheal intubation is recommended as the risk of 124 aerosolization and droplet transmission is increased.[18] All personnel, upon entering the 125 room, should wear N95 masks, eye/face protection, gloves and gowns. PPE should be transmission of viral disease through aerosols has been an ongoing concern.[20, 21] 130 Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this route has not been reported, perhaps because the 131 aerosols are not from the respiratory tree. Another unique consideration for arthroplasty 132 surgeons is the utilization of surgical hoods (i.e. \"spacesuits\"). Multiple sources, 133 including formal memos from industry, have stated that this equipment alone is not 134 protective against SARS-CoV-2.[20, 22, 23] These hoods do not filter enough particles 135 in the 0.02 to 1 \u03bcm diameter range to meet the standard for protective respirators.[20] 136 This class of PPE is primarily utilized for protection against in-motion debris and was 137 never designed as a respiratory protection system.[23] Based on current available 138 evidence, surgical hoods can still be used for COVID-19 positive patients, but must be in 139 conjunction with an N95 respirator.[20] Importantly, the ideal technique for proper 140 cleaning of the helmets (including the hard to access fans utilized in the ventilation 141 system) remains to be defined. 142 Operating on patients without confirmed or suspected COVID-19 143 There are a substantial proportion of asymptomatic infected patients.[24] It may 144 be prudent to test all patients preoperatively, if possible. In a study by Lei et al., 145 asymptomatic patients unknown to be in the incubation phase of the infection 146 experienced mortality rates as high as 20% and rates of ICU admission of 44% as their 147 disease became apparent post-operatively.[25] One important testing concern is the 148 possibility of false negative results both with the standard swabs and the more recent 149 released rapid test systems.[26, 27] Due to the prevalence of asymptomatic disease and the lack of accurate testing at this time, proactive PPE use for healthcare providers during the pandemic including the use of N95 respirators at all times may be warranted. 152 At the time of this writing, elective arthroplasty surgery is not commonly being 153 performed in the United States. When elective operations resume, it may be prudent to 154 test all patients prior to surgery during the waning pandemic.[15] The aggressive testing 155 of all pre-operative patients, if testing accuracy, availability and timing allow, is one 156 strategy to reduce the risk for all parties as we resume elective arthroplasty surgery. 157 PPE outside of the operating room 158 PPE utilization for the orthopaedic surgeon outside of the operating room is based 159 on the current CDC recommendations for all personnel in the health-care setting.[9] 160 When possible, N95 respirators should be utilized by all healthcare personnel working 161 with or near COVID-19 positive patients. In situations where shortage of N95 respirators 162 precludes the utilization by all personnel, surgical masks can be substituted, with the 163 recognition of their reduced effectiveness for preventing airborne transmission. Bartoszko 164 et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of surgical masks for preventing droplet 165 transmission in most scenarios.[28] In a meta-analysis of available literature, Offeddu et 166 al. demonstrated equivalence between standard surgical masks and respirator masks for 167 healthcare workers in preventing infection of viral respiratory illnesses.[29] However, 168these studies were on influenza and do not consider the potential increased 169 transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.[29] In addition to N95 respirators, additional protection 170 typically worn for airborne precautions is required. This includes an isolation gown, face 171 shield or goggles, and gloves.[9] There is some evidence that in the setting of COVID-19, PPE in short supply, as has been seen inNewYork State. The CDC has provided 176 guidance on strategies to optimize the rate of PPE consumption, allowing for use outside 177 the manufacturer's instructions and expiration date.[30-33] Broadly, the PPE supply 178 strategies are conservation, extension of use, and decontamination with reuse. 179 The primary method for conservation of PPE supply is the delay of elective and 180 non-urgent surgical procedures.[30-33] Other techniques include altering the annual N95 181 fit testing (i.e. just-in-time training, qualitative testing, or temporarily suspending 182 testing), decreasing hospital length of stay for medically stable COVID-19 patients, 183 limiting face-to-face encounters with COVID-19 patients, and excluding visitors to 184 COVID-19 patients.[30-33] 185 Extended use of an N95 is not recommended under normal circumstances, but the 186 practice of wearing the same N95 respirator during repeated encounters with different 187 patients can help extend the supply of N95 respirators.[33] The CDC does not 188 recommend the extended use of the same N95 respirator for more than 8 to 12 hours.[33] 189 The CDC has been working on the development of evidence-based protocols for 190 decontamination of disposable filtering face-piece (DFFP) N95 respirators that maintain 191 filtration and tight-fit capacity.[34] An additional resource has been N95DECON, a 192 consortium of scientists, engineers, and clinicians who are working to provide up-to-date 193 evidence-based statements on the decontamination of DFFP N95 respirators.[35] The use 194 of vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and 195 moist heat are promising methods for decontamination of DFFP N95 respirators.[34, 35]",

            "text": "1] The HICPAC/CDC guidelines are centered on the 31 mode of transmission of each disease. The transmission-based precautions include 32 contact, droplet, and airborne precautions.[2] In theory, SARS-CoV-2 could be 33 transmitted via a bloodborne pathway but additional precautions are not necessary 34 secondary to universal precautions against bloodborne pathogens that have been 35 standard-of-care in the healthcare setting. The CDC has provided guidance on standard precautions that should be utilized for all patient care and in diseases where additional patient cannot be placed in a single patient room, the patient beds must have at least 3 60 feet between the beds with systems implemented to prevent inadvertent sharing of 61 equipment or other items.[1] 62 Droplet transmission occurs through direct or indirect contact with contaminated 64 30 to 50um respiratory droplets that enter through the nasal mucosa, conjunctiva, and/or 65 mouth.[4, 6] In the healthcare setting, respiratory droplets are most commonly produced 66 via coughing, sneezing, talking, suctioning, endotracheal intubation, and 67 cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Droplet precautions limit the transmission of respiratory 68 droplets through placement of the patient in single room, use of a mask during direct 69 patient contact, limited transportation of the patient, and adherence to precautions during 70 necessary transport.[1, 2, 4, 5] When the patient requires transportation within the 71 healthcare facility or placement in a multi-patient room, source control can be achieved 72 through use of a mask on the patient and placement of the beds at least 3 feet apart.[1] 73 Special airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIR) are not necessary because the pathogen 74 does not remain infectious over long distances.[1] 75 infectious diseases spread via droplet versus airborne transmission is that airborne 80 diseases have the ability to disperse over long distances and remain infective for an 81 extended period of time.[1, 4, 7] Currently, the CDC is uncertain about the ability of",

The authors report that 222 this high rate of transmission led to \"great stress and depression for these surgeons.\" 223 Their recommendation, for orthopaedic surgeons working in hospital settings during the 224 pandemic, was to avoid close contact with family members at home.[16] This is 225 obviously a difficult recommendation to follow from both a psychological and pragmatic 226 standpoint. Currently, there is little clinical evidence to guide recommendations. The 227 American College of Surgeons recommends removing and washing clothes immediately 228 upon arrival at home, cleaning cell phones before and after patient care activities, 229 frequent hand washing, and reducing physical contact with family members.[18] In 230 addition, they recommend that healthcare institutions and systems allow for hotel 231 accommodations for healthcare works who cannot, or prefer not to, go home following 232 patient care activities. 233 The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had a devastating 235 Practices Advisory C. 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission 244 of Infectious Agents in Health Care Settings. 245 https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/guidelines/isolation-guidelines-H.pdf. 246 Accessed April 10, 2020. 247 [2].
