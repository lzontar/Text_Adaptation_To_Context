            "text": "COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a new type of acute respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as of 17 April 2020, 2,074,529 cases and 139,378 deaths have been reported worldwide. Among them, China has reported a total of 84,149 cases and 4642 deaths [1] . Some reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may be originated in bats [2] . Snakes could be the intermediate host [3] . Controversially, according to many other studies, pangolins are more likely [4] . Due to its highly contagious nature, the virus has attracted great attention worldwide. According to the Chinese 'Seventh Edition of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol' [5] , suspected patients with negative nucleic acid samples from two consecutive airway specimens (sampling interval of at least 24 h) can be excluded from diagnosis and released from quarantine. This report describes a suspected case of COVID-19 patient who had close contact history with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was only positive after four sputum sample tests (sampling interval of at least 24 h). This suggests that in case of suspected patients who have had close contact history with confirmed COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid should be tested repeatedly to avoid missed diagnosis.",

The patient may be a third-or fourth-generation infected person, suggesting that in early February, more than three generations of SARS-CoV-2 have been transmitted in areas outside of Wuhan and Hubei. Modern transportation has made personnel movements more rapid, which might have accelerated the virus transmission speed [6] . The patient's mother had fever before her death, and her father went to two hospitals due to his fever before the diagnosis. Neither of them had the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. If the patient's parents and the attending medical staff were not effectively protected at the time, further transmission may have occurred. Therefore, the vigilance of medical staff in outpatient and emergency departments around patients with fever and respiratory symptoms should be further improved and comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing should be performed on such patients [7] . This is a typical case of a family cluster onset, which is common in many other cases [8] . During the epidemic period, although the father who initially developed the disease had no clear history of contact, he had stayed in multiple hospitals. Owing to the complexity of pathogen sources in hospitals, there may be potential sources of COVID-19 infection. This suggests that during the epidemic, hospital stay should be minimized. If there are feverish cases in the family, effective isolation measures should be implemented as early as possible to minimize the spread of the virus. This patient's nucleic acid test for respiratory pathogens has been negative on two consecutive occasions (sampling interval of at least 24 h). According to the Chinese 'Seventh Edition of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol' [5] , she had already met the standards of releasing from quarantine and discharging from hospital. However, a fourth subsequent respiratory tract sample showed positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Usually, nucleic acid positive rate is 80-83% [9, 10] , which suggests that in patients with a clear epidemiological history of contact with COVID-19 or suspected patients from a family cluster, the quarantine period should be appropriately extended and the nucleic acid tests should be performed repeatedly to avoid accidental discharge which may cause further virus spread.",

It is reported in the literature that taking sputum sample from a deep spot in the lung may increase the positive rate [11] . But clinically, many patients have a dry cough without any sputum, which makes it more difficult to retain sputum samples. This could be one of the reasons for the low nucleic acid positive rate. Therefore, for patients who are highly suspected for COVID-19 but with negative nucleic acid, repeated testing should be performed. In case of persistent negativity, sampling of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid should be considered. Other testing methods, such as blood IgM, second-generation sequencing may also be used to achieve confirmed diagnosis.",
