Freely available open-source algorithms, which have the ability to individualise algorithm parameters paired with commercial insulin pumps, and continuous glucose monitoring make up the so-called \"do it yourself\" (DIY) approach to AID. Limited data on the open-source approach have shown promising results, but data from a large randomised control trial are lacking. Methods The CREATE (Community deRivEd AutomaTEd insulin delivery) trial is an open-labelled, randomised, parallel 24week, multi-site trial comparing sensor augmented pump therapy (SAPT) to our AnyDANA-loop. The three components of AnyDANA-loop are: 1) OpenAPS algorithm implemented in a smartphone (a version of AndroidAPS), 2) DANA-i\u2122 insulin pump and, 3) Dexcom G6 R continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The primary outcome measure is the percentage of time in target sensor glucose range (3.9 -10mmol/L). Secondary outcomes include psycho-social factors and platform performance. Analysis of online collective learning, characteristic of the open-source approach, is planned. 100 participants with T1D aged 7 -70 years (age stratified into children/adolescents 7-15 years and adults 16-70 years), will be recruited from four sites in New Zealand. A 24-week continuation phase follows, to assess long-term safety.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Less than one third of people with T1D achieve glycaemic control targets known to reduce the risk of long-term complications [1] . Accordingly, rates of acute and chronic complications among people with T1D remain unacceptable, which impacts quality of life and generates significant costs to healthcare [2, 3] . New therapies are essential to reduce both complications for people with T1D and healthcare costs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 125, "end": 128, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 304, "end": 307, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 308, "end": 310, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "AID, also known as closed loop or artificial pancreas, is an innovative new therapeutic approach that revolutionises outcomes for people with T1D [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . AID links an insulin pump and a CGM to an algorithm that automatically adjusts insulin delivery to optimise glycaemic control. Currently, commercially available AID systems are expensive, and individuals that have access are either in a high income bracket, or live in countries with extensive private health insurance, or a public health system that subsidises modern diabetes technologies. A cost-effective AID system may improve global equity in access to AID. One solution is an open-source approach. Use of an algorithm developed through open-source innovation would facilitate the development of an AID system at a fraction of the cost of commercial models. In 2013, Dana Lewis and Scott Leibrand developed an algorithm to respond to changes in sensor glucose levels and automate insulin delivery. In 2014, their work evolved into a do-it-yourself (DIY) artificial pancreas, which they elected to make open-source by sharing the code, the reference design for the algorithm and all documentation [9] . Since then, a community of people living with T1D, openly frustrated with the lack of availability of commercial systems, have refined the algorithm and deployed their collective knowledge, underpinning the creation of a DIY open-source AID system. Although 'DIY' has been used to describe the open-source systems, it is a misnomer since the success of communitydesigned AID systems has been a collaborative effort, and users make use of various open-source resources. Opensource AID systems have the potential to reduce the cognitive burden associated with laborious diabetes tasks, hence improving quality of life for those living with T1D. The Open Artificial Pancreas System (OpenAPS) movement launched by Dana Lewis in 2015 has been fostered by thousands of people with T1D worldwide and numbers are flourishing [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 146, "end": 149, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 150, "end": 153, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 158, "end": 161, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 162, "end": 165, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1173, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1993, "end": 1997, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Automated insulin delivery"}, {"text": "Several retrospective studies [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] show communitydesigned AID systems succeeding in the real world and, observational studies undertaken abroad [17] [18] [19] reveal the wider applicability of these systems.
