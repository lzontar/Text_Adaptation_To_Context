Furthermore, the concept of 'academic motherhood' has been widely studied and addressed. Women academics are inundated with service while at the same time serving as the primary caregiver to their children (Guarino & Borden, 2017; Van Anders, 2004) . Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, navigating being a mother and academic has taken on a whole new meaning. Now that a worldwide pandemic is upon us, working mothers, particularly in academia, are struggling to keep up with their male counterparts more than ever before. A recent study suggests that while journal submissions from men academics have increased as universities have gone virtual, those from women have significantly decreased (Flaherty, 2020) .",

In fact, the division of labor in housework has not progressed much over the last several decades, despite the increase of women working in professional careers (Lachance-Grzela, Bouchard, 2010) .

Although this is not an ethnographic study in the traditional sense, we are, in retrospect, crafting an autoethnographic account of our experience during this worldwide health crisis. In this reflective, dialoguebased piece, positionality is especially important to frame the context of our motherhood and careers as well as set up our perspectives on life during the COVID-19 pandemic. trying to generalize our experiences, but we hope that our vulnerability will help the struggles of women to be seen.

RCT is a psychological development model that emphasizes connection and relationships as the basis of development, rather than prior models that promote self-sufficiency and independence as the hallmarks of growth.

Connection is not merely just having an exchange with another person that makes you feel good, however it is the act of being \"heard and understood\" (West, 2005) . This helps us to create a sense of worthiness, where we believe our thoughts and feelings matter and are valid (West, 2005) . RCT argues that when an individual shares their feelings with another individual, but those feelings are not recognized, the individual sharing their feelings is left feeling alone (Miller & Stiver, 1997) .

Theories such as RCT directly go against Western values and norms, stating that growth and development happens through relationships, not separation and independence (Banks, 2011).

Ultimately, autoethnography involves examining one's individual experience to better understand a larger phenomenon (Ellis, Adams, & Bochner, 2011) .

A study by Trepal and Stinchfield (2012) , which examined motherhood amongst both tenured and nontenured faculty members in the field of counselor education, suggests that women faculty place particular onus on themselves to establish boundaries between their work and their home life. In fact, while mothers place more of an emphasis on work-life balance than men do, they also do the majority of household work than their male counterparts (Baker, 2012) . Moreover, \"women are more likely than men to fit their employment around their family's needs\" (Baker, 2012, p.22) . Despite rank, field, and time in their position, women academics find it difficult to prevent their work life from making its way into their home life, due to the variety of roles that pull on their time (Ward, K. & Wolf-Wendel, 2004) . According to Martinez, O'Brien, and Hebl (2017) , not only is it challenging for women to maintain work-life balance, but this also causes them to leave their positions for family reasons more often than men do. In addition to struggling to balance household responsibilities with their careers, women in academia face inflexible leave policies and discrimination (Phillips, 2002) . All of this was found before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. During the current health crisis with most academics working from home, maintaining these boundaries is simply not realistic. Baker (2012) indicates that \"gendered living arrangements and unequal workloads at home contribute to the perpetuation of the academic gender gap\" (p.22). How is our current health crisis exacerbating the gap?",

On the outside these traits have allowed me to be seen as a go to colleague, as I'm always full of good ideas, always willing to help, and always overachieving. Internally, this need for control and drive for perfectionism is the main source of my anxiety and loneliness. You may say, 'I understand the anxiety piece, but the loneliness doesn't make sense.' Let me dig into this a bit. The need to \"perform\" as a perfectionist is very real, I want others to see my work as outstanding, no no exemplary. As our lives have transitioned to working from home this sense of loneliness has intensified, as the guilt of not being able to \"perform\" my responsibilities leaves me feeling ashamed, embarrassed, and angry with myself as I am ashamed by my lack of productivity. The narrative I've come to know, since I was a child, tells me that I have to earn connection, validation, and approval from others. Therefore, my lack of productivity leaves me feeling empty and vulnerable to not earning the respect, validation, and connection of others. This article is protected by copyright.

When it didn't look like it was going to happen for me in the traditional way, my husband and I became foster parents of two rambunctious schoolaged brothers in August 2019. Fast forward to December, and I had a newborn baby girl in This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. my arms. I went from having zero kids to three kids in a matter of months. Then, a week before I was scheduled to go back to work from maternity leave in March, our university announced it was going virtual. I went back to work, but I didn't go 'back' to work. Brittany: My career is extremely important to me, although not as important to me as family, it is still a very salient aspect of my identity. In October 2019 my world changed as we welcomed our son into the world. For the months leading up to his birth I methodically reflected and planned my maternity leave and my plan for reintegration back to work. During my first semester back on campus after maternity leave I learned to juggle being a mom and a professional, although I did both roles satisfactory I did them SEPARATELY. That is until March 2019 when our university went remote. Sheva: I currently work as the Program Manager for our university's Faculty Enrichment Center. In this role, I manage our brand-new center through program planning and dissemination as well as the facilitation of our physical space, in a nutshell. Our charge is to provide professional development services to our university's diverse faculty body; through this position, I have taken charge of several faculty development initiatives full-force. Needless to say, my career has always been my number one priority until I started building a family. Always ambitious and determined, I completed my PhD in Educational and Community-Based Action Research by the time I was 25, graduating with a presidential medal. My research and teaching practice have always been at the forefront of my career trajectory. Despite working as a full-time staff member in an administrative position under the Office of the Provost, I adjunct part-time teaching Psychology courses as well as conduct participatory action research on the 'side.' Although my research, teaching, and service do not formally 'count' towards any sort of promotion criteria, they are an integral part of my This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. professional identity. Once our children came into my life, I realized that I would have to begin a balancing act between my work and home life. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined the new virtual world we live in, as 'work' and 'home' have merged together to form a huge blurr, and any semblance of 'work-life balance' has been eradicated. That said, I am immensely grateful to be able to spend this time with my husband, two young boys, and infant daughter, despite the challenges. Brittany: Currently I am an associate professor within the Division of Experience Based Learning and Career Education. As an educator faculty, my main responsibilities include teaching courses and facilitating the co-op program for computer engineering students. My faculty role is unique in that most of my time is spent working directly with students in a one on one capacity, reflecting with them or helping them secure co-op opportunities. In the beginning I was excited for the opportunity to work from home, as it would allow me additional time to spend at home with my son. However, I shortly realized this transition to a remote environment was going to be more challenging than I could have imagined, for more reasons than one. As an individual who is an overachiever in most aspects of my life, I expect excellence in my career and in my role as a mother. Through this experience I've had to learn to accept that my reality will not allow perfection at the moment. As cliche as it sounds, taking it one day at a time, is the best I can do at the moment. As my colleagues continue to remind me, we are all doing the best we can. I am doing the best I can.Brittany & Sheva: We both would like to acknowledge a few things. First of all, we recognize our privilege as white women, and we are aware that we are lucky in the fact that we have retained our jobs during this crisis and have even been afforded the opportunity to continue working in a safe environment.

            "text": "Those three days in the office allowed me to get my work done, connect with colleagues, have adult conversations, but more importantly it allowed me to live out my identity of being a professional. As previously mentioned, my career is extremely important to me and my identity as an educator/academic is very salient. Going into work also ensured that on the days I was home with my son, I was both physically and mentally home with him. This was wonderful, I had done it, I had found a balance that worked for me where both my identities of being a mom and a professional could live in harmony. Then COVID-19 happened. In March 2020 my institution went remote, with no return to campus anywhere in sight. I'll be honest, initially I was excited, thinking \"this is perfect, I can work from home and spend more time with my son.\" There was no longer an expectation to be in the office, therefore I didn't have to feel guilty about working from home. However, the reality of being a full-time mom and a full-time professional quickly set in. After a few weeks of this \"going remote\" quarantine life, the anxiety, sadness, and frustration set in. After much reflection I began to understand where these feelings came from. For me, these overwhelming feelings came from my identities, which previously were allowed to exist separately, but now were being forced to live simultaneously-and I didn't like this! Being a mom is tough, being an educator is tough, but doing them both at the same time was something I wasn't emotionally prepared for. article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Sheva: I, like Brittany, have struggled with my identity as I navigate what it means to be a mom concurrently with being a professional, compiled with the fact that my family and I are quarantined together. I felt much the same way as Brittany when I found out I could work from home and spend more time with my daughter and the boys. The thought, \"Wow, an extended maternity leave!\", crossed my mind many times. And, similarly to my colleague, I very quickly realized I was out of my league. How was I supposed to balance it all when my work life and home life were suddenly integrated so deeply, without any time to prepare? I found myself in video calls while bouncing my baby on my knee and muting myself to yell, \"What are you boys up to?!\" after hearing a crash coming from their bedroom. I felt like I was failing in all my roles--as a wife, as a mother, as a staff member, and as a professor. How was I supposed to keep everyone--my husband, my kids, my boss, my colleagues, the faculty I serve, and my students--happy and taken care of? Again, like Brittany, I began to feel pangs of guilt for not being able to give my usual 110% to every aspect of my life. Did I also mention I have 6 pets? Sigh. It used to be so much easier! Even though it was still so difficult to manage the balancing act of mommy versus doctor before the pandemic, I had separate spaces. At least I didn't have to do it all at the same time, in the same house, day after day. I swear, I didn't know how good I had it! It is becoming increasingly challenging to maintain work-life boundaries (don't even say work-life balance to me right now!). Finding a way for my identities to coincide without arguing with each other over competing priorities is something I will have to work on every day during this new virtual world. Even now, I am sitting in the only quiet place I can find, my baby's nursery, hooked up like a milk cow, pumping breast milk as I type this\u2026 Brittany: One of my colleagues mentioned to me when I was pregnant, stating \"I'm a better mom because I come to work.\" Her words confirmed for me what I knew to be true, I could This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. be a great mother AND a great professional. In a \"normal\" world I had constructed what that would look like for myself. However, during COVID world the blending of these two roles/identities proved to be a struggle logistically, mentally, and emotionally. Similarly to Sheva, the guilt I feel about not being able to perform my identities on my own terms has been frustrating. But, not being able to perform my responsibilities, as a mother and as a professional, to my high standards has been internally devastating. Sheva: Wow. That takes on a whole new meaning now that \"coming\" to work means sitting at the dining room table with a coffee in one hand and a baby in another. I agree with your colleague in that I want to show my daughter that woman can do it all. It helps remind me that I can be a better mom through role modeling, and that my career can help me raise my children more effectively. This quarantine has been a great way to instill in the boys, too, that the lines between 'women's work' and 'men's work' don't exist any more, while their dad bakes bread and their mom goes to meetings. All work is important work. Brittany: I couldn't agree more that we must be intentional in what we model for our children, as well as our colleagues. I want my son to live in a world where he is proud to have been raised by a passionate, working, feminist mommy. At the same time, I want to model for my colleagues that this work, being a mom and a professional, is hard! I won't sugar coat how difficult this is in order to make others more comfortable. So, my son regularly makes an appearance on conference calls and meetings. I hold him as he screams, smacks me, and pulls my hair during a tantrum (he is seven months old and has no idea what he's doing). I want others to see, this is hard, but I'm doing the best I canand today that means my child is also my most important colleague. article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Sheva: I love that take on it, Brittany, seeing your baby as your colleague. My daughter, at five months old, frequently joins me during video conferencing, as well. I can't believe she hasn't spit up on my computer yet but I know it is coming! In a way, it is important to me for my colleagues to see this as a reminder of everything we are all juggling right now. Sheva: There is simply no way I will be productive as I have been in the past. That is a fact that took time (and tears) to accept. To let go of productivity and survive on doing the bare minimum, as an overachiever who has a lifetime struggle with obsessions and compulsions, is ridiculously hard to do. Brittany: Similarly to Sheva, I have had to accept the fact that my productivity levels will not be what they once were. Being a recovering perfectionist during a pandemic and quarantine has been something therapy is made of. Each day I have to remind myself to give MYSELF grace. Accepting that everyday I may not be as \"put together\" as I once was as a professional, and that is OKAY. This constant reminder has been necessary to allow me to stay grounded. Again, I'm doing the best I can. Sheva: I am doing the best I can, as well, to give myself grace as I embrace all these new roles that I have taken on. I am now a mother, an elementary school teacher, a wife, a college professor, a homemaker, a program manager, a chef, a writer, and a doctor, ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

When the boys are doing their schoolwork, it's mommy this and mommy that 24/7. I can't catch a break in either my work or home life and due to the lockdown there is no real escape from either. We are ALL together ALL the time! I have come up with some techniques to mitigate the issues that arise while working from home (while also homeschooling children and taking care of a household and infant): 1. Set Boundaries: Working from home can blur the lines between home hours and work hours. I make it a point not to respond to email on the weekends or after 5pm. I may still be doing work behind the scenes, just because of how much my day is broken up with the kids, but I can make it clear that lines of communication to me are closed during those times. 2. Prioritize: As I mentioned, we simply cannot be as productive as we used to. To quote Brittany, we need to give ourselves grace. I am a checklist/list person. Take the time out at the beginning of every week and the beginning of every day to write out what you plan on doing, and divide it up--what NEEDS to get done versus what can be put on the back burner if something else arises. It also helps to knock out those pesky fiveminutes-or-less tasks, the earlier the better, which leaves more time to focus on bigger projects. 3. Chunking: In the current state of the working world, it is impossible to sit down for 3, 4 hours at a time and power through a big project. If you have even 15 minutes of time to devote to a larger project, USE IT. It adds up and you will be more productive than you think. Take those small chunks of time that you have and make them worthwhile. Also, to my fellow academics, do the absolute best you can carving out those 30 minutes per day to write!!

Multitask: This may seem to contradict the above tips, but sometimes multitasking is necessary, as long as it involves parallel processing. For example, I can feed my daughter while I am on a video call--these tasks involve two totally different parts of my brain, making it manageable. Or, I can supervise the children while getting work done if we all do our work together at the dining room table. As mothers and academics, we need to figure out ways to do two things at once, in a manageable way that reduces burnout. Brittany, do you have any working from home tips and tricks that you swear by?? Brittany: I also am a list maker, for me the feeling of crossing something off my list is euphoric. Therefore, I typically write as many things down on my to do list as I can, as a way to give myself mental freedom to not have to carry the burden of remembering what needs to be done. My main strategy I've found useful during COVID world is I make two separate \"to",

            "text": "Sheva: Brittany, your narrative deeply resonates with me. I have struggled with anxiety surrounding pleasing others and the guilt that comes when I feel that I am not doing enough. Going straight from maternity leave to work without leaving the house has greatly intensified my postpartum anxiety, especially as it is combined with my fear of the coronavirus. I have dealt with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder for almost my entire life, and being at home for such an extended period of time has reawoken many of these symptoms. Furthermore, I have always had control issues surrounding food, and the This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. uncertainty of stock at the grocery compiled with too much time in the house and kitchen has caused these issues to resurface. Like Brittany, I have a need to control everything in my life, and our new situation has caused me to become totally unglued. I no longer can control aspects of my life that I used to have a handle on, and that terrifies me. On top of all that, the adoption process with our two foster children has stalled due to the virus. As a result of this, Brittany: I don't want my colleagues to see me as the dreaded \"crazy\" woman. However, I am also tired-physically, mentally, and emotionally. But more importantly, I'm tired of pretending I am okay. I'm exhausted from trying to uphold this facade of perfectionism. COVID-19 has forced me to accept my flawed humanity. It has forced me to welcome my weaknesses and my imperfections. Within me it has welcomed an honest and authentic conversation about who I am and what I need. The fear, anger, and loneliness that quarantine life has brought, has also brought me a sense of clarity through deep reflection. It's almost as if I've been forced back to my roots, to dig deep into questioning what is important in my life. Because of social distancing and stay at home orders, my schedule is no longer filled with commitments that don't bring me joy. But rather, I actively choose to use the time I have to do things that bring me happiness. As an educator, this reflection, has reminded me that I love what I do-I love getting to work with students, mentor them, and watch them grow and mature into amazing professionals. I'm reminded that I work with amazing colleagues, who have become my friends, and push me to be better. I'm reminded that I have a lovely home, an amazing supportive husband, and an adorable tiny human that This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. calls me mommy. Although this life is tough, and god can it be tough, I'm also reminded how unbelievably beautiful it can be when we find connection, with ourselves and with others. Sheva: I completely get where you're coming from about now being seen as 'crazy.' Every time I am on a video call I feel like I have to pretend that I am totally put together and that everything is fine. It feels like not many people in my professional life have admitted to struggling with the uncertainty of our future on campus, so I am afraid to mention my fears. I have been throwing a wrap on over my nursing nightgowns, pulling my hair into as clean of a ponytail as I can, putting a background effect over the nursery, and hope nobody will notice what I really look like underneath the surface. Brittany: I find myself role playing or pretending to be a put together professional. Similar to Sheva, in the morning before conference calls I throw on a presentable top (preferably one without spit up on it) and slap on some mascara. Woolah we are ready to go for the day. After the initial enjoyment of working remotely, I began to feel very isolated and disconnected from my colleagues. I didn't feel seen as a mother of an infant who was attempting to figure out this parenting and working from home thing. My colleagues had older kids or no kids, or spouses that were also working from home that they could take shifts playing the caregiver role. This realization caused me to feel even more isolated, which triggered anxiety and sadness. I enjoy my colleagues very much, so how could I feel so isolated all of a sudden, even though I know they are there for me. I didn't feel seen for who I was, for the struggles I was facing, or the exhaustion I was experiencing! I couldn't be open and authentic about what I was feeling and experiencing, because I was ashamed I couldn't \"do it all\". article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Eventually, my colleagues started to be honest about their struggles with remote life, mentioning that they too were struggling with isolation and sadness, feeling disconnected. This shifted my sadness, their authenticity allowed me to feel more connected with them. This sparked a change in the way we were working remotely: we started having weekly meetings to just check in with each other and we developed group chats to bounce ideas off each other and provide support. The feeling of isolation started to fall away, I was starting to feel connection again. Sheva: It is no secret that we, as a human race, are experiencing a collective trauma. I have engaged in several ways to promote my own self-care as well as maintain connection with others while social distancing. Brittany: Although this time of being remote has been tough, it has challenged me to reflect more deeply than ever before. During the months I've spent cooped up at home, playing with my son, I've tried to create my own happiness. Recognizing that connection with others is such an important aspect of my life, I've had to find unique ways to feel this connection. Taking the time to video chat with family members who live in other states regularly, calling friends while I take my daily walks (talking to them on the phone while I walk is almost like they are walking with me), virtual trivia nights, and ensuring I have alone time. I think it is important that through all of this we remember, it is okay to ask for what you need. I need time to be by myself, time to decompress and to not be a mom or a professional-time to just exist as Brittany. Sheva: I need to do a better job on reflecting, and writing this paper has helped me immensely with that. As an extrovert, I resist being alone with my own thoughts. My self-care during this time has relied much on connecting with others in any way that I can. I have skyped friends for virtual happy hours and started a feminist book club. I have engaged in socially distanced porch exchanges and even got ordained to host my sister's wedding (six feet apart with masks on!). While none of this has looked like my traditional social life, I am doing as much as I can to maintain the relationships that are most important to me. I am even working on my relationship with myself--I am going to therapy again to address my anxiety and compulsions, which is a huge milestone for me. Brittany: As an introvert, you would assume that quarantine life would be my happy place. To be honest, the first few weeks were great. I had an excuse to not go to parties or gatherings (I was very happy about this). But, by week six I began going stir crazy. It wasn't the being stuck in the house that got to me, it was the feeling of being out of connection with others. The words of Brene Brown, reminds us, \"we are hardwired to connect with others, it's what gives us purpose and meaning to our lives, and without it there is suffering.\" As Sheva mentioned, we are all experiencing a collective trauma, and we are all suffering. Through all of this, we must find a way back to each other. We must find a way to bring connection and humanity back into our lives. Here are some things that I have done that have allowed me to feel less isolated and gain more connection: 1. Find ways to share space with others, even virtually. My colleagues and I developed a group chat where we can brainstorm ideas and provide support for one another. The chat quickly became a place where we'd share our authentic selves and the struggles we were facing with the new \"normal\". This became a space where I could This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. feel seen and show empathy to others. We quickly recognized this connection was something we were all craving, so we went further and added check in meetings and virtual lunches to our weekly schedule, to carve out time for connection. 2. Don't be afraid to ask for what you need. As previously mentioned, I am an introvert and need alone time to recharge. Having alone time is tough as a mom, even tougher when you are stuck in the house 24/7 with an infant. After I put my son to bed, I often take laps around my yard by myself. I've had to communicate with my husband the sacredness of my alone time. This time alone allows me to recharge and center. If I neglect the need for alone time, I definitely notice a difference in my mental health. Some days my alone time requires that I intentionally carve out a few quiet minutes to myself while my son naps. Don't be ashamed or embarrassed to acknowledge what you need, and ask for it! 3. Be creative in doing things that you once did. Our lives look different now, that is the reality. But, that doesn't mean we can't still find joy in the things that we once loved. Get creative. I love getting drinks and food with friends, nothing is better in my opinion than to connect with another person over food. Social distancing put a damper on my weekly lunch dates with friends. However, having virtual happy hours or virtual meals with friends has allowed me to stay connected with those I love. Although the experience looks different, the essence is still the same, connecting and laughing with friends/family. Sheva, what have you found helpful in allowing you to stay connected with others?",
