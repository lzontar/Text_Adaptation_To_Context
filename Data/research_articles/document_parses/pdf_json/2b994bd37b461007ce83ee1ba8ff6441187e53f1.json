The respiratory disease caused by an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while in most cases showing a mild course of disease, can also cause severe symptoms, and an increased mortality risk especially among older persons and those with pre-existing health conditions. While writing this editorial in our home-offices in Belgium, Germany, and Japan, already more than 35,000 people have died from COVID-19. Many countries established more or less strict rules with the goals to flatten the epidemic curve to ensure that not too many people with a severe form of COVID-19 need to be treated in intensive care units in hospitals at the same time.",

Regarding family life, kindergartens and schools are closed. Direct social contact, even to close family members like grandparents, needs to be restricted or must be completely suspended. Regarding work life, organizations must reduce or shut down their production, or try to find alternative ways to provide their services; hotels, restaurants and shops, except grocery stores, are closed. Workers have to adapt: some workers are temporarily unemployed, others have to work from home and have to find new ways to collaborate; healthcare staff are working until exhaustion-all have to establish new routines to adapt to the adverse conditions, with much insecurity about the impact of the crisis in the future and potential job loss. This obviously poses a pressure on the workfamily interaction, with combinations of different roles-parent, employee, teacher-almost without boundaries.",

We feel that much can be learned from earlier work in the broad area of applied psychology: earlier studies provide us with the necessary jargon and they may hint at evidence-based recommendations that could be transferred to the current situation. Going through published papers from the last 15 years in Applied Psychology: An International Review, we selected a set of seven papers dealing with topics that are connected to today's demands and that could inspire a more specific search, or that could facilitate interventions: our set of papers include insights related to: (1) change in health behaviors; (2) working from home in relation to virtual teams; (3) from the perspective of work-home interaction; (4) overall high levels of job insecurity; and (5) the specific situation of healthcare workers. We are very much aware that none of the studies presented in this virtual issue were conducted in a situation that comes close to the situation today. Therefore, we aim to follow up with a special issue, including invited papers from internationally renowned scholars on topics with particular resonance for the ongoing crisis and potential consequences.",

To illustrate, risk perception and outcome expectancy are among the key motivational factors to successful change in health behavior. This knowledge can be used by policy-makers, media, and healthcare practitioners in their communication strategies.",

The paper offers fruitful angles to facilitate mutual support, even without direct physical contact. The authors provide a set of dimensions that, if fulfilled, should foster group cohesion and functionality of teams even under adverse conditions. Just to name a few here, they point towards the importance of building confidence that the group can perform its specific tasks and achieve its broader goals, given current capabilities and situational demands. This confidence can be established by reminding team-members on successful team projects in the past, which should foster the collective belief in the group's capability to deal with demanding and even adverse situations. Furthermore, establishing a common purpose should increase group cohesion, and promote mutual care, and kindness, as well as loyalty to the group and its members. Leaders can support these team processes, by providing space for open communication, team reflection, and by valuing each individual team-member's contributions.",

The concept of resilience has gained momentum in organizational research (cf. Britt et al., 2016; Kuntz, Naswall, & Malinen, 2016) and has been applied to groups. West, Patera, and Carsten (2009) defined team resilience as the capacity to bounce back from failure, setbacks, conflicts, or any other threat. Degbey and Einola (2019) followed 46 project teams for about 3 months, working virtually together on a management project task. They used extensive qualitative data to provide ideas for successful resilience development. Three key mechanisms were extracted, and are suggested to foster team resilience: (1) regulating and leveraging emotional expression (e.g., \"letting go\" or \"speaking up\"), which can be attained by proactive sense-making and resource investment, reflection of team work, and the suppression of spontaneous negative emotions;",

It gets even greater weight today when boundaries are quasi non-existent: many employees work from home, while at the same time taking up caring and often also teaching tasks. Under these circumstances and given ongoing and close proximity, work and family compete for limited resources, time and energy in particular, with consequences for both parents and their children.",

In addition, paternal frustration spills over to children in the form of less supporting parental behavior which ultimately affects children's view of work. Children in the Lim et al. study are undergraduates. A plausible assumption is that consequences are exacerbated in families with young children or in single parents. This study highlights that organizations could and perhaps should support employees in designing the work-home interface. Many organizations do so today: there are good examples of organizations that provide workers with extra resources, including training and interventions to effectively manage the work-family interface. In the current situation, it also means that employers should be flexible concerning the scheduling of (virtual) meetings, maybe the opportunity to reduce working-time, with options to compensate in postcrisis times.",

Rather than seeking support with each other, a strong job insecurity climate may hamper interaction and lead to withdrawal.

Contextual factors, such as staff shortages over the last years and the expansion of profit-driven management of public and private hospitals, have made the working conditions even more demanding. Not surprisingly then, a large body of studies have concerned working conditions and associated health and well-being among healthcare workers. It goes without saying that healthcare personnel are at particular risk during this pandemic: there is an increased infection risk and workers may be even more vulnerable for secondary post-traumatic stress. Hence, it is of utmost importance to provide the necessary resources, both resources tied to the job and to the person.",
